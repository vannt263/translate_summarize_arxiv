    "it has long been recognized that molecular viscosity can not be solely responsible for angular momentum transport in accretion discs . @xcite offered an appealing solution to this problem by postulating a source of enhanced disc viscosity due to turbulence and magnetic fields .",
    "the standard accretion disc model rests on the idea that the stresses between adjacent disc annuli are proportional to the local shear , as in a newtonian laminar shear flow , but that it is the interaction of large turbulent eddies that results in efficient transport .",
    "the idea that turbulent angular momentum transfer in accretion discs can be described in terms of an enhanced version of the molecular transport operating in ( laminar ) differentially rotating media has been at the core of the majority of studies in accretion disc theory and phenomenology ever since ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the turbulence that leads to enhanced angular momentum transport in accretion discs has been a matter of debate since the work of @xcite .",
    "the issue of whether hydrodynamic turbulence can be generated and sustained in astrophysical discs , due to the large reynolds numbers involved , is currently a matter of renewed interest @xcite .",
    "however , this idea has long been challenged by analytical @xcite , numerical @xcite , and , more recently , experimental work @xcite .    during the last decade ,",
    "it has become evident that the interplay between turbulence and magnetic fields is at a more fundamental level than originally conceived .",
    "there is now strong theoretical and numerical evidence suggesting that the process driving the turbulence in accretion discs is related to a magnetic instability that operates in the presence of a radially decreasing angular velocity profile . since the appreciation of the relevance of this magnetorotational instability ( mri ) to accretion physics ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; see also balbus & hawley 1998 and balbus 2003 for a more recent review ) , a variety of local @xcite and global @xcite numerical simulations have revealed that its long - term evolution gives rise to a turbulent state and provides a natural avenue for vigorous angular momentum transport .",
    "the fact that the overall energetic properties of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) accretion discs are similar to those of viscous accretion discs @xcite has lead to the notion that angular momentum transport due to mri - driven turbulence in rotating shearing flows can be described in terms of the alpha model proposed by @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , has motivated many efforts aimed to computing effective alpha values from numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) in order to use them in large scale analytical models of accretion discs .    in this paper",
    ", we address in detail how the transport of angular momentum mediated by mhd turbulence depends on the magnitude of the local disc shear and contrast this result to the standard model for shear viscosity .",
    "we find that one of the fundamental assumptions in which the standard viscous disc model is based , i.e. , that angular momentum transport is linearly proportional to the local shear , is not appropriate for describing turbulent mri - driven accretion discs .",
    "the equation describing the dynamical evolution of the mean angular momentum density of a fluid element , @xmath0 , in an axisymmetric , turbulent mhd accretion disc with tangled magnetic fields is @xmath1 here , the over - bars denote properly averaged values ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", i.e. , to loose angular momentum , the sign of the mean total stress must be positive .",
    "note that the potential for correlated kinetic fluctuations to transport angular momentum in unmagnetized discs is still present in the hydrodynamic version of equation ( [ eq : angular_momentum_mean ] ) .",
    "however , the dynamical role played by the correlated velocity fluctuations in hydrodynamic flows is radically different from the corresponding role played by correlated velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in mhd flows , even when the magnetic fields involved are weak @xcite .    in order to calculate the structure of an accretion disc for which angular momentum flows according to equation ( [ eq : angular_momentum_mean ] ) ,",
    "it is necessary to obtain a closed system of equations for the second - order correlations defining the total stress @xmath3 . in this context ,",
    "the original proposal by shakura and sunyaev ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be seen as a simple closure scheme for the correlations defining the total turbulent stress in terms of mean flow variables ( e.g. , the pressure ) .",
    "the model for angular momentum transport on which the standard accretion disc is based rests on two distinct assumptions .",
    "first , it is postulated that the vertically averaged stress exerted on any given disc annulus can be modeled as a shear viscous stress @xcite , i.e. , in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for the vertically integrated disc density and the angular velocity at the radius @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "this is a modification of the newtonian model for the viscous stress between adjacent layers in a differentially rotating laminar flow @xcite ; in this case , the coefficient @xmath13 parametrizes the turbulent kinematic viscosity . in this model ,",
    "the direction of angular momentum transport is always opposite to the angular velocity gradient .",
    "this is the essence of a shear - driven viscous disc .",
    "second , on dimensional grounds , it is assumed that the viscosity coefficient can be parametrized as @xmath14 .",
    "this is because the physical mechanism that allows for angular momentum transport is envisaged as the result of the interaction of turbulent eddies of typical size equal to the disc scale - height , @xmath15 , on a turnover time of the order of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "the parameter alpha is often assumed to be constant and smaller than unity . in the presence of a shear background , the vertically integrated stress",
    "is then given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for the average pressure , @xmath20 is the ratio of specific heats , and we have used the fact that the scale - height of a thin disc in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium is roughly @xmath21 .",
    "this parametrization of the coefficient of turbulent kinematic viscosity implies that the efficiency with which angular momentum is transported is proportional to the local average pressure .",
    "this is the idea behind the standard alpha - disc model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the expression usually employed to define the stress in alpha - models , i.e. , @xmath22 , only provides the correct order of magnitude for the stress in terms of the pressure for a keplerian discs . indeed , in this case ,",
    "the shear parameter @xmath23 is equal to @xmath24 .",
    "however , the fact that the viscous stress is proportional to the local shear can not be overlooked in regions of the disc where the local angular velocity can differ significantly from its keplerian value .",
    "this is expected to be the case in the boundary layer around an accreting star or close to the marginally stable orbit around a black hole .",
    "these inner disc regions are locally characterized by different , and possibly negative , shearing parameters @xmath25 .",
    "more importantly , if the explicit dependence of the stress on the local shear is not considered then equation ( [ eq : stress_standard ] ) predicts unphysical , non - vanishing stresses for solid body rotation , @xmath26 ( c.f . , * ? ? ?",
    "more than a decade after the paper by @xcite , the mri stands as the most promising driver of the turbulence thought to enable the accretion process .",
    "the stresses associated with this mri - driven turbulence have long been considered as the physical mechanism behind the enhanced turbulent viscosity postulated in the standard model for shear - driven angular momentum transport .",
    "it is important to note , however , that there is no a priori reason to assume that the correlated fluctuations defining the total turbulent stress in mri - driven turbulence are linearly proportional to the local shear .",
    "in fact , this assumption can be challenged on both theoretical and numerical grounds .",
    "there are currently few models that aim to describe the local dynamics of turbulent stresses in differentially rotating magnetized media by means of high - order closure schemes @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the total stress , @xmath27 , is not prescribed , as in equation ( [ eq : stress_standard ] ) , but its value is calculated considering the local energetics of the turbulent flow .",
    "this is achieved by deriving a set of non - linear coupled equations for the various components of the reynolds and maxwell stress tensors .",
    "these equations involve unknown triple - order correlations among fluctuations making necessary the addition of ad hoc closure relations .",
    "although the available models differ on the underlying physical mechanisms that drive the turbulence and lead to saturation , some important characteristics of the steady flows that they describe are qualitatively similar .",
    "in particular , all of the models predict that turbulent kinetic / magnetic cells in magnetized keplerian discs are elongated along the radial / azimuthal direction , i.e. , @xmath28 while @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , turbulent angular momentum transport is mainly carried by correlated magnetic fluctuations , rather than by their kinetic counterpart , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "all of these properties are in general agreement with local numerical simulations . however , a distinctive quantitative feature of these models that concerns us here is that they make rather different predictions for how the stresses depend on the magnitude and sign of the angular velocity gradient .    in the remaining of this section , we highlight the most relevant physical properties characterizing the various models and assess the functional dependence of the total stress , @xmath31 , on the sign and steepness of the local angular velocity profile . for convenience ,",
    "we summarize in appendix a the various sets of equations that define each of the models .      in a series of papers",
    ", @xcite developed a model for hydromagnetic turbulence in accretion discs with no large scale magnetic fields ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review , and nakao 1997 for the inclusion of large scale radial and toroidal fields ) .",
    "in their closure scheme , triple - order correlations among fluctuations in the velocity and magnetic fields are modeled in terms of second - order correlations using the two - scale direct interaction approximation @xcite , as well as mixing length concepts .    in the model",
    "described in @xcite , the shear parameter @xmath25 appears explicitly only in the terms that drive the algebraic growth of the turbulent stresses .",
    "the physical mechanism that allows the stresses to grow is the shearing of magnetic field lines .",
    "this can be seen by ignoring all the terms that connect the dynamical evolution of the reynolds and maxwell stresses . when this is the case , the dynamics of these two quantities are decoupled .",
    "the maxwell stress exhibits algebraic growth while the reynolds stress oscillates if the flow is rayleigh stable ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the growth of the magnetic stresses is communicated to the different components of the reynolds stress via the tensor @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are model constants .",
    "a characteristic feature of this model is that the physical mechanism that leads to saturation is conceived as the escape of magnetic energy in the vertical direction .",
    "this process is incorporated phenomenologically by accounting for the leakage of magnetic energy with terms of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 stands for the escape rate .",
    "although turbulent kinetic and magnetic dissipation act as sink terms in the equations for the various stress components ( proportional to the model parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ) , if it were not for the terms accounting for magnetic energy escape , the system of equations would be linear .",
    "this means that , in order for a stable steady - state solution to exist , either the initial conditions or the constants defining the model will have to be fine - tuned .",
    "the functional dependence of the total stress on the shear parameter @xmath25 for the model proposed in @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : stress_shear ] .",
    "the model predicts vanishingly small stresses for small values of @xmath40 ; the total stress @xmath31 is a very strong function of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath41 , the model predicts @xmath42 .    .",
    "the various lines show the predictions corresponding to the three models for turbulent mhd angular momentum transport discussed in  [ sec : stress_modelling ] .",
    "the data points correspond to the volume and time averaged mhd stresses calculated from the series of shearing box simulations described in  [ sec : stress_simulations ] .",
    "the diamonds and circles represent the results obtained in the isothermal ( @xmath43 ) and adiabatic ( @xmath44 ) cases , respectively . the vertical bar in the simulations corresponding to",
    "the shear parameter @xmath45 shows the rms spread in the stresses as calculated from ten numerical simulations for a keplerian disc .",
    "this spread , of roughly @xmath46 , can be taken as a representative value for the typical rms spread in runs with different values of the parameter @xmath25 for both the isothermal and adiabatic cases .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to a linear relationship between the stresses and the local shear , like the one assumed in the standard model for viscous angular momentum transport .",
    "all the quantities in the figure are normalized to unity for a keplerian profile , i.e. , for @xmath45 . ]      based on a set of fundamental principles constraining the non - linear dynamics of turbulent flows , @xcite developed a model for the dynamical evolution of the maxwell and reynolds stresses .",
    "five non - linear terms accounting for key physical processes in turbulent media are modeled by considering the form of the corresponding triple - order correlations , energy conservation , and other relevant symmetries .",
    "the resulting model describes the development of turbulence in hydrodynamic as well as in magnetized non - rotating flows .",
    "an interesting feature is that , depending on the values of some of the model constants , it can develop steady hydrodynamic turbulence in rotating shearing flows . for differentially rotating magnetized flows with no mean magnetic fields ,",
    "the physical mechanism that allows the stresses to grow algebraically is the shearing of magnetic field lines , as in the case of @xcite .",
    "the transfer of energy between turbulent kinetic and magnetic field fluctuations is mediated by the tensor @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the traces of the reynolds and maxwell stresses , respectively , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are model constants .",
    "note that , in this case , the terms that lead to communication between the different reynolds and maxwell stress components are intrinsically non - linear . the terms leading to saturation",
    "are associated with the turbulent dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy and are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the dependence of the total stress on the shear parameter for the model described in @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : stress_shear ] .",
    "for angular velocity profiles satisfying @xmath54 , the stress behaves as @xmath55 with @xmath56 between roughly 2 and 3 . although the functional dependence of the total stress on negative values of the shear parameter @xmath25 is different from the one predicted by the model described in @xcite , this model also generates mhd turbulence characterized by negative stresses for angular velocity profiles increasing outwards .",
    "motivated by the similarities exhibited by the linear regime of the mri and the fully developed turbulent state @xcite , we have recently developed a local model for the growth and saturation of the reynolds and maxwell stresses in turbulent flows driven by the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the modes with vertical wave - vectors dominate the fast growth driven by the mri , we obtained a set of equations to describe the exponential growth of the different stress components . by proposing a simple phenomenological model for the triple - order correlations that lead to the saturated turbulent state",
    ", we showed that the steady - state limit of the model describes successfully the correlations among stresses found in numerical simulations of shearing boxes @xcite .    in the model described in @xcite , a new set of correlations couple the dynamical evolution of the reynolds and maxwell stresses and play a key role in developing and sustaining the magnetorotational turbulence .",
    "in contrast to the two previous cases , the tensor connecting the dynamics of the reynolds and maxwell stresses can not be written in terms of @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "this makes it necessary to incorporate additional dynamical equations for these new correlations . in this model ,",
    "all the second - order correlations exhibit exponential ( as opposed to algebraic ) growth for shear parameters @xmath54 , in agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "incidentally , this is the only case in which the shear parameter , @xmath25 , plays an explicit role in connecting the dynamics of the reynolds and maxwell stresses .",
    "the terms that lead to non - linear saturation are proportional to @xmath59 , where @xmath49 is the trace of the maxwell stress and @xmath60 is a characteristic energy density set by the local disc properties .",
    "the functional dependence of the total turbulent stress on the local shear for the model developed in @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : stress_shear ] . for angular velocity profiles decreasing outwards ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath41 , the stress behaves like @xmath61 with @xmath56 between roughly 3 and 4 . for angular velocity profiles increasing outwards",
    ", i.e. , for @xmath62 , the stress vanishes identically .",
    "note that this is the only model that is characterized by the absence of transport for all negative values of the shear parameter @xmath25 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in all three high - order closure schemes described above , the pressure , @xmath63 , does not appear explicitly in the equations defining the models .",
    "however , it does play a role in setting the overall scale at which the stresses saturate .",
    "this is because the pressure provides a characteristic velocity ( e.g. , the sound speed ) or a characteristic length ( e.g. , the disc scale height ) which in turn determine the saturation level of the stresses @xmath3 . in order to compare the predictions of how the dimensionless stresses depend on the local shear independently of other factors , we normalized the quantity @xmath64 predicted by each model in figure  [ fig : stress_shear ] with the values corresponding to the keplerian cases with the same pressure . allows us to compare the shear - dependence of the various models regardless of their initial field configurations . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : stress_shear ] illustrates the sharp contrast between the functional dependence of the saturated stresses predicted by all three mhd models with respect to the standard shear viscous stress defined in equation ( [ eq : shear_stress_turb ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , despite the fact that the various models differ on their detailed structure , all of them predict a much steeper functional dependence of the stresses on the local shear . indeed , for angular velocity profiles decreasing outwards , they all imply @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the predictions of the various models differ more significantly for angular velocity profiles increasing outwards . in this case , the models developed in @xcite and @xcite lead to negative stresses , while the model developed in @xcite predicts vanishing stresses .",
