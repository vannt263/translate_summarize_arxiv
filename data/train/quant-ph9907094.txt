    "in his pioneering paper [ 1 ] , john bell established the first of a series of inequalities now collectively known as `` bell inequalities '' which demonstrate the incompatibility between the predictions of quantum theory and the limitations imposed by a local and realistic world view .",
    "bell showed that for an einstein - podolsky - rosen - bohm gedanken experiment [ 2,3 ] , the quantum - mechanical predictions for an ensemble of pairs of spin-@xmath0 particles prepared in the singlet state violate an inequality which must necessarily be satisfied by any physical theory based on the reality and locality postulates .",
    "more recently hardy [ 4 ] , by means of an ingenious thought experiment , managed to find a proof of nonlocality for two particles without using inequalities , with each of the particles living in an effective two - dimensional hilbert state space .",
    "a more systematic version of this proof was given by hardy himself [ 5 ] , and then by goldstein [ 6 ] , jordan [ 7,8 ] , aravind [ 9 ] , and cereceda [ 10 ] , among other authors . in its simplest form ,",
    "hardy s nonlocality theorem involves the values of four dichotomic observables ( two for each particle ) , and states that a direct contradiction between the quantum - mechanical and locally realistic predictions concerning such values can arise for some probabilistic fraction of an ensemble of particle pairs configured in an entangled state , provided that the entanglement is not maximal .",
    "the converse of this result has also been proved [ 7,11 - 13 ] : for any choice of two different observables for each particle , a state can be found which admits a hardy - type nonlocality contradiction .",
    "however , while jordan s valuable treatment of the converse lacks some of the clearness required by a beginner student ( in fact , jordan s proof can be greatly simplified , as shown in refs .",
    "[ 11 - 13 ] ) , kar s remarkable proof deals only with abstract projection operators , without any reference to concrete physical measurable quantities . regarding mermin s instructive",
    "proof ( see sections i and ii of ref .  [ 13 ] ) , i maintain that his conclusion that , ``  we can do the trick with any two choices of nontrivial local one - particle observables to be measured in mode 1 on the right and on the left , and any state @xmath1 of the form ( 2 ) with three nonzero amplitudes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 '' , is not entirely correctly stated .",
    "indeed , from eq .",
    "( 7 ) of ref .  [ 13 ] , we can see that the magnitude of @xmath4 is fixed by the quantities @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "likewise , from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 7 ) of ref . , we can readily express the magnitude of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in terms of the four quantities above . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( 3 ) [ ( 4 ) ] of ref .",
    ", it follows that the phase of @xmath3 [ @xmath2 ] is in turn determined by the phases of @xmath10 and @xmath11 [ @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( without loss of generality , we may choose the amplitude @xmath4 to be real ) .",
    "so , strictly speaking , the trick will only work for that state @xmath1 whose ( nonzero ) coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 _ do _ satisfy simultaneously the above set of eqs.(3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 7 ) .",
    "what mermin actually proves is a version of the converse of hardy s theorem , in which both nontrivial one - particle observables for mode 1 on the right and on the left are _ quite _ arbitrary ( in mermin s words , `` you can pick any two one - particle observables you like for the detectors to measure when their switches are set to 1 '' ) , both one - particle observables for mode 2 on the right and on the left are _ almost _ arbitrary ( in mermin s words , `` the choices of the two observables measured by the detectors in modes 2 are almost as flexible '' ) , and where , as a result , the state @xmath1 turns out to be fixed ( up to an arbitrary overall phase factor ) by the above choice of four observables through the eqs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 7 ) of ref .  [ 13 ] . as mermin then shows",
    ", the probability of getting the `` impossible '' @xmath14 events is maximum for those choices of observables for which @xmath15 @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the golden mean , @xmath19 .",
    "following mermin s treatment , in this paper we present a direct , easy - to - grasp proof of the converse of hardy s theorem for two spin-@xmath0 particles ( which we call @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) that achieves a certain generality while retaining the mathematical simplicity .",
    "this proof makes clear the fact that , for two spin-@xmath0 particles and for a given choice of observables , there is a unique state which satisfies hardy s nonlocality .",
    "moreover , a graphical representation of the probability for a hardy - type contradiction ( see eq .  ( 9 ) and fig .  1 below ) is given in terms of two independent parameters related to the observables involved .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the spin components of each particle along directions lying within the _ x - z _ plane , so that we shall deal with the observables @xmath22 and @xmath23 for particle @xmath20 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for particle @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 being spin components along directions making an angle @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively , with the _ z _ axis in the _ x - z _ plane ( of course it is understood that the _ z _ axis is defined with reference to in general different coordinate systems for each of the particles ) .",
    "further , as usual , it is assumed that each of the spin components yields the outcome @xmath31 or @xmath32 ( in appropriate units ) if measured .",
    "a two - particle state @xmath33 exhibits a hardy - type nonlocality contradiction if there exist two observables for each particle  say , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for particle @xmath20 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for particle @xmath21such that the following four conditions are simultaneously fulfilled for the state @xmath34 @xmath35 where , for example , @xmath36 denotes the probability that a joint measurement of the observables @xmath22 and @xmath24 on particles @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , gives the result @xmath31 for both observables when the particles are described by the state vector @xmath33 . as we have said , every entangled state except those maximally entangled ( such as the singlet state considered by bell ) shows hardy - type contradiction , that is , there are observables @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( in fact , there are an infinite number of them [ 6,7,10 ] ) for which the conditions ( 1a)-(1d ) are fulfilled for the entangled state . that conditions ( 1a)-(1d ) lead to a contradiction with the assumption of local realism can be seen as follows [ 5 ]",
    "consider a particular run of the experiment for which the observables @xmath23 and @xmath25 are measured on a pair of spacelike separated particles @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the state @xmath33 , and the results @xmath37 and @xmath38 are obtained . from eq .",
    "( 1d ) , there is a nonzero probability for these joint measurement results to occur . by invoking local realism , and taking into account the constraint in eq .",
    "( 1c ) , one could assert that a result @xmath39 would have been obtained if , instead of @xmath40 , the observable @xmath24 had been measured on particle @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , from eq .",
    "( 1b ) , and applying local realism , one might conclude that a result @xmath41 would have been obtained for a measurement of @xmath22 on particle @xmath20 . in this way ,",
    "the quantum predictions ( 1d ) , ( 1c ) , and ( 1b ) , together with the assumption of local realism , allows one to deduce that there must be a nonzero probability to obtain the results @xmath41 and @xmath39 in a joint measurement of the observables @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "however , from eq .",
    "( 1a ) , we can not have simultaneously the results @xmath41 and @xmath39 for any pairs of particles described by @xmath33 .",
    "hence a contradiction between quantum mechanics and local realism arises without using inequalities .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the relative angles @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we are now ready to prove the converse of hardy s theorem .",
    "specifically , we show that for any choice of @xmath27 , @xmath44 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( or , equivalently , for any choice of @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) , there exists a two - particle state @xmath47 satisfying the above conditions ( 1a)-(1d ) , provided that both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are not an integral multiple of @xmath48 .",
    "to do this , we first write the quantum state in terms of eigenvectors for the @xmath22 component of particle @xmath20 and @xmath24 component of particle @xmath21 @xmath49 where , for example , @xmath50 represents a state of spin - up for particle @xmath20 along a direction inclined at an angle @xmath27 to the _ z _ axis in the _ x - z _ plane .",
    "the coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( which , for simplicity , are assumed to be real  the extension to complex coefficients offering no difficulty ) obey the normalization condition @xmath55 of course the expansion ( 2 ) is always possible since the set of product vectors @xmath56 , with @xmath57 or @xmath32 , span the total four - dimensional hilbert space associated with the spin of particles @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , condition ( 1a ) does hold for the state vector @xmath47 if , and only if , @xmath58 . on the other hand , by expressing the eigenvectors @xmath50 and @xmath59 in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 and the eigenvectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 in terms of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 it is immediate to see that the fulfillment of conditions ( 1b ) and ( 1c ) is equivalent to requiring , respectively , that @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( note that the pair of eqs .  ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) is the equivalent of mermin s pair of eqs .  (",

    "( 8a)-(8c ) , and the coefficient @xmath51 set to zero , satisfies the hardy equations ( 1a)-(1c ) .",
    "it remains to check out that , for such a state , the probability @xmath72 is nonzero almost everywhere .",
    "this probability is a measure of the statistical fraction of particle pairs prepared in the state @xmath33 , for which a joint measurement of @xmath73 and @xmath25 gives results which , when combined with the quantum predictions ( 1a)-(1c ) , can not be explained by any locally realistic theory .",
    "on using the coefficients ( 8a)-(8c ) in expansion ( 2 ) , and replacing the eigenvectors @xmath74 , @xmath59 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 with the corresponding expression ( 4a ) , ( 4b ) , ( 5a ) , and ( 5b ) , one finds that the above probability is given by @xmath77 this function is represented in fig .  1 for the ranges of variation @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the probability function ( 9 ) is found to vanish wherever @xmath80 , or @xmath81 , with @xmath82 . except for these values of @xmath45 or @xmath46",
    "the above probability is positive .",
    "the vanishing of ( 9 ) corresponds to the case in which the observables @xmath22 and @xmath83 , or @xmath24 and @xmath25 , happen to commute .",
    "so we have proved that for any two pairs of noncommuting observables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for particle @xmath20 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for particle @xmath21 , a two - particle state exists that fulfills the conditions ( 1a)-(1d ) .",
    "as we have said , this state is given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) with @xmath58 , and @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath54 given by eqs .  ( 8a)-(8c ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the state vector ( 2 ) satisfying the set of equations ( 1a)-(1d ) for given @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath84 is unique up to an arbitrary overall phase factor .",
    "this follows from the fact that , ( i ) the eigenvectors @xmath74 and @xmath59 [ @xmath63 and @xmath85 appearing in expansion ( 2 ) are uniquely determined by the angle @xmath27 [ @xmath29 ] ; and ( ii ) the expansion coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath54 satisfying the relations ( 3 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) ( with the coefficient @xmath51 set to zero in eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) are unique ( up to a common sign factor ) for fixed values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this uniqueness implies that no mixture state for two spin-@xmath0 particles admits hardy s nonlocality for fixed choice of observables [ 11,12 ] .",
    "now , according to mermin s theory [ 13 ] , and making the identifications @xmath87 it follows that the probability ( 9 ) is maximum for those choices of @xmath88 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath89 for which @xmath90 and @xmath91 from eqs .",
    "( 4b ) and ( 5b ) , condition ( 11a ) implies that @xmath92 .",
    "analogously , from eqs .",
    "( 4a ) and ( 5a ) , condition ( 11b ) implies that @xmath93 . for the ranges of variation @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "these conditions are fulfilled for the following pairs of values ( see fig.1 ) : @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , with @xmath98 .",
    "for any one of these pairs , the probability function ( 9 ) attains the maximum value @xmath99 , while the squared coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 yielding this maximum probability are @xmath103 naturally , according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we have @xmath104 .    on the other hand , as mentioned above , the probability ( 9 ) is zero for either @xmath80 or @xmath81 , so that the nonlocality argument will fail as soon as any one of the four quantities @xmath105 , @xmath106 , with @xmath57 or @xmath32 , happens to vanish .",
    "this is just the reason why the choice of all four observables @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , can not be totally arbitrary . as mermin points out [ 13 ] , in order for the argument to run , it is necessary that the eigenvector @xmath107 @xmath108 $ ] has nonzero components along both @xmath50 and @xmath59 @xmath109 and @xmath110 . clearly",
    "the fulfillment of this condition guarantees that the eigenvector @xmath111 @xmath112 $ ] has equally nonzero components along both @xmath50 and @xmath113 @xmath114 and @xmath110 . by the way we note that the above conditions ( 11a ) and ( 11b ) defining the maxima of the probability function ( 9 ) can be written equivalently as @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "likewise , the vanishing of any one of the four quantities @xmath117 , @xmath118 , means that the probability ( 9 ) is zero.@xmath119 it will further be noted that for the particular case in which @xmath120 , expression ( 9 ) reduces to @xmath121 while the coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath54 are found to be @xmath122 ^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } ,    \\\\",

    "we conclude by noting that the lack of one of the terms in expansion ( 2 ) prevents the state vector @xmath33 from being maximally entangled . to see this , recall that , according to the schmidt decomposition theorem [ 9,14,15 ] , any pure spin state for two spin-@xmath0 particles can be expressed as a sum of two biorthogonal terms . in particular , the state vector ( 2 ) with @xmath58 , and @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath54 given by eqs .",

    "we want to show that the state vector ( 2 ) with @xmath58 does not admit a decomposition like that of eq .",
    "( 17 ) for which @xmath135 .",
    "this follows in a rather straightforward way from the easily confirmed fact that , whenever @xmath136 , the state vector ( 17 ) implies that @xmath137 however , for the case in which @xmath51 is equal to zero , we have from eq.(2 ) that @xmath138 . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability @xmath139 is in general different from zero , as can be seen from eq .",

    "this contradiction establishes that the state vector satisfying the conditions ( 1a)-(1d ) for given @xmath27 , @xmath44 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , can not be maximally entangled .",
    "this is consistent of course with the fact that no maximally entangled state for two spin-@xmath0 particles can give a hardy - type nonlocality contradiction [ 5 - 10 ] .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us now briefly sketch how one can find the decomposition ( 17 ) that obtains for a given state vector ( 2 ) .",
    "( recall that @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ( with @xmath70 , @xmath140 or @xmath48 ) are arbitrary but fixed parameters , and that the coefficient @xmath51 is set to zero throughout . )",

    "further , we have that @xmath161 . now , according to the general theory of the schmidt decomposition [ 14,15 ] , it follows that the square of the coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 in eq .",
