    "internal melting and the subsequent differentiation into an iron - dominated core , a magnesium - elevated mantle and a silicon - rich crust are central to the evolution of the solar system s rocky planets .",
    "being on the surface , crusts are the most easily studied of these three different zones , and when examined in detail , they display a wide variety of elemental compositions @xcite .",
    "while other crusts are largely basaltic , earth s continental crust is compositionally unique @xcite because , as a consequence of plate tectonics , it is the product of partial melting of preexisting oceanic crustal material  itself",
    "basaltic  that results in striking enrichments in  incompatible \" elements by magmatic distillation .",
    "the possibility that extrasolar rocky planets undergo plate tectonics has been extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "much of this effort has been motivated by the recognition that plate tectonics may affect a planet s habitability @xcite . however , current observational tests of whether extrasolar rocky planets experience plate tectonics have seemed unrealistic @xcite . here , we argue that an indirect search for the operation of earth - analog plate tectonics on extrasolar rocky planets is possible because of the unique chemical signature that would be produced in the spectrum of an externally polluted white dwarf .",
    "the generally accepted standard model for the presence of elements heavier than helium in the atmospheres of white dwarfs cooler than 20,000 k is that these stars have accreted tidally - disrupted asteroids @xcite .",
    "as a zero - order approximation , it has been found that as with bulk earth , major constituents of extrasolar planetesimals are oxygen , magnesium , silicon and iron @xcite .",
    "no truly exotic objects as predicted by @xcite  such as being carbon / silicon dominated or being calcium / aluminum / oxygen dominated  have been found @xcite .",
    "consequently , it seems that geophysical models for the origin and evolution of rocky objects developed for the solar system may be extended to extrasolar planetesimals .",
    "evidence is now strong that extrasolar planetesimals have experienced igneous differentiation @xcite with individual accreted parent bodies understood as measurably consisting of an fe - rich core @xcite , an fe - poor mantle @xcite , an al - rich crust @xcite or a mixture of core and crustal material @xcite .",
    "internal heating and the subsequent melting from the decay of @xmath1al plausibly can help explain these results @xcite .",
    "fragments of evolved planetesimals or even entire planets may be separated from their parent body by collisions and subsequently accrete onto the white dwarf while retaining their distinctive compositional signature . here , we assess whether there is even a modest contribution from continental crust - analog material to the total accretion onto two well observed white dwarfs .",
    "that is , although the bulk of matter accreted onto white dwarfs originates in asteroids , there inevitably must be some collisional erosion of the surface of a rocky planet which would result in some planetary crustal material also contributing to the pollution of the host star . in the solar system , there is an exchange among the terrestrial planets of impact ejecta @xcite ; similar processes must occur in extrasolar environments .",
    "below , in section 2 , we first describe what we might expect for extrasolar basaltic and continental crustal compositions by extrapolating from the solar system .",
    "because sr and ba over - abundances relative to ca are uniquely high in earth s continental crust , we then assess available evidence for the concentrations of these two elements in two externally - polluted white dwarfs in section 3 .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we discuss our results and summarize our conclusions .",
    "although there are many imaginable routes for the formation and evolution of extrasolar rocky planets , we develop our expectations of extrasolar crustal compositions from those four solar system bodies for which detailed abundance measurements of their crusts have been achieved : earth , the moon , mars and vesta @xcite . in all cases , the two most abundant elements are o and si , followed by al and ca . because they are largely sequestered into the core and mantle , respectively , fe and mg are deficient .    compared to basaltic crusts ,",
    "earth s continental crust is compositionally unique : ",
    "incompatible \" elements are highly concentrated within this outermost zone containing about 0.6% of the planet s mass @xcite . lying in the same column of the periodic table , ca , sr and ba  three incompatible elements of interest here  have relatively large ionic radii that are accommodated by the more silica and al - rich tectosilicates that form from crystallization of the partial melts of oceanic plate material .",
    "the consequent coalescence of the products of melting in the form of island arcs ( for example , japan ) produces continental crust that persists because it is too buoyant to be subducted .",
    "the most pronounced chemical enrichment occurs for ba , the largest atom .",
    "we list in table 1 , the mass concentrations relative to ca of selected key elements in the four best - studied solar system crusts . in the crusts of the moon ,",
    "mars and vesta , sr and ba are at most modestly enhanced relative to ca while both elements are markedly enhanced in earth s continental crust and modestly depleted in earth s oceanic crust .",
    "therefore , simultaneous substantial enhancements of @xmath0(sr)/@xmath0(ca ) and @xmath0(ba)/@xmath0(ca ) can serve as an observational signature of earth - analog plate tectonics .",
    "table 1 - crustal abundance ratios by mass relative to ca    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we follow standard astronomical usage to report photospheric abundances by number , denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "we follow standard cosmochemical usage and compare parent body mass ratios , denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the more stringent result is found for gd 362 .",
    "for this star , we find from equation ( 8) that less than 0.4% of the accreted calcium is from material with the composition of earth s continental crust .",
    "consequently , the crustal contribution to the contamination of gd 362 @xcite is mostly basaltic ; there is no evidence for any material produced by plate tectonics . for pg 1225@xmath3079",
    ", the corresponding result is that less than 20% of the calcium is derived from material compositionally similar to continental crust .      from table 2",
    ", we find for gd 362 that the sr / ca abundance ratio is even less than in ci chondrites .",
    "this is not expected in our model and when more data become available , more sophistical models can be developed . for pg 1225@xmath3079 , there is no evidence that sr is measurably enhanced beyond its relative concentration in ci meteorites .",
    "at least in the solar system , the total mass in continental crust is greater than the mass in asteroids .",
    "therefore , even though asteroids dominate the accretion onto white dwarfs , there might be favorable circumstances where the planetary contribution to the heavy elements polluting a white dwarf s photosphere is measurable .",
    "for example , at earth , while most meteorites are derived from asteroids , about 0.07% originate in the crust of mars .",
    "detailed simulations for a wide variety of orbital architectures are required to compare the rate of collisional erosion of a planetary crust with the rate of asteroid destruction and , for both processes , the subsequent accumulation onto the host white dwarf .",
    "consider a strategy to extend the pilot search reported here .",
    "in dz stars , the equivalent width of ca ii 3933  can exceed 30  @xcite ; these stars typically are identified with low - resolution spectra @xcite . with follow - up high - spectral resolution studies of members of this class of stars , it should be possible to make useful measures of the sr and ba abundances to compare with different crustal abundances .",
    "available data allow us to conclude , that the abundances of sr and ba relative to ca in two externally - polluted white dwarfs are much less than found in earth s continental crust .",
    "consequently , to - date , there is no evidence for extrasolar earth - analog plate tectonics .",
