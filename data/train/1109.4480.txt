    "efficient numerical methods for the simulation of damped wave phenomena are of fundamental importance in acoustic , electromagnetic or seismic wave propagation . in the presence of complex geometry , such as cracks , sharp corners or irregular material interfaces ,",
    "standard finite difference methods generally become ineffective and cumbersome . in contrast , finite element methods ( fems ) easily handle unstructured meshes and local refinement . moreover ,",
    "their extension to high order is straightforward , a key feature to keep numerical dispersion minimal .",
    "the finite element galerkin approximation of hyperbolic problems typically leads to a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , if explicit time - stepping is subsequently employed , the mass matrix arising from the spatial discretization by standard conforming finite elements must be inverted at each time - step : a major drawback in terms of efficiency . to overcome that difficulty ,",
    "various `` mass lumping '' techniques have been proposed , which effectively replace the mass matrix by a diagonal approximation . while straightforward for piecewise linear elements @xcite , mass lumping techniques require special quadrature rules at higher order to preserve the accuracy and guarantee numerical stability @xcite .",
    "discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods offer an attractive and increasingly popular alternative for the spatial discretization of time - dependent hyperbolic problems @xcite . not only do they accommodate elements of various types and shapes , irregular non - matching grids , and even locally varying polynomial order , and hence offer greater flexibility in the mesh design .",
    "they also lead to a block - diagonal mass matrix , with block size equal to the number of degrees of freedom per element ; in fact , for a judicious choice of ( locally orthogonal ) shape functions , the mass matrix is truly diagonal .",
    "thus , when a spatial dg discretization is combined with explicit time integration , the resulting time - marching scheme will be truly explicit and inherently parallel .    in the presence of complex geometry , adaptivity and mesh refinement",
    "are certainly key for the efficient numerical simulation of wave phenomena .",
    "however , locally refined meshes impose severe stability constraints on explicit time - marching schemes , where the maximal time - step allowed by the cfl condition is dictated by the smallest elements in the mesh .",
    "when mesh refinement is restricted to a small region , the use of implicit methods , or a very small time - step in the entire computational domain , are very high a price to pay . to overcome this overly restricitve stability constraint , various local time - stepping ( lts ) schemes @xcite",
    "were developed , which use either implicit time - stepping or explicit smaller time - steps , but only where the smallest elements in the mesh are located .    since",
    "dg methods are inherently local , they are particularly well - suited for the development of explicit local time - stepping schemes @xcite . by combining the sympletic strmer - verlet method with a dg discretization , piperno derived a symplectic lts scheme for maxwell s equations in a non - conducting medium @xcite , which is explicit and second - order accurate . in @xcite , montseny et al .",
    "combined a similar recursive integrator with discontinuous hexahedral elements .",
    "starting from the so - called arbitrary high - order derivatives ( ader ) dg approach , alternative explicit lts methods for maxwell s equations @xcite and for elastic wave equations @xcite were proposed . in @xcite , the lts approach from collino et al .",
    "@xcite was combined with a dg - fe discretization for the numerical solution of symmetric first - order hyperbolic systems .",
    "based on energy conservation , that lts approach is second - order and explicit inside the coarse and the fine mesh ; at the interface , however , it nonetheless requires at every time - step the solution of a linear system .",
    "more recently , constantinescu and sandu devised multirate explicit methods for hyperbolic conservation laws , which are based on both runge - kutta and adams - bashforth schemes combined with a finite volume discretization @xcite .",
    "again these multirate schemes are limited to second - order accuracy .",
    "starting from the standard leap - frog method , diaz and grote proposed energy conserving fully explicit lts integrators of arbitrarily high accuracy for the classical wave equation @xcite ; that approach was extended to maxwell s equations in @xcite for non - conductive media . by blending the leap - frog and the crank - nicolson methods , a second - order lts scheme was also derived there for ( damped ) electromagnetic waves in conducting media , yet this approach can not be readily extended beyond order two .    to achieve arbitrarily high accuracy in the presence of dissipation , while remaining fully explicit , we shall derive here explicit lts methods for damped wave equations based on adams - bashforth ( ab ) multi - step schemes .",
    "they can also be interpreted as particular approximations of exponential - adams multistep methods @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we first recall the standard continuous and the symmetric interior penalty ( ip ) dg finite element discretizations of the second - order damped wave equation ; there , we also rewrite the damped wave equation as a first - order hyperbolic system and recall its nodal dg formulation . starting from the adams - bashforth multi - step schemes ,",
    "we then derive in section 3 a lts approach of arbitrarily high accuracy .",
    "when combined with a finite element discretization in space with a diagonal mass matrix , the resulting time - marching schemes remain fully explicit . finally in section 4 , we present numerical experiments in one and two space dimensions , which validate the theory and underpin both the stability properties and the usefulness of these adams - bashforth lts schemes .",
    "we consider the scalar damped wave equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a bounded domain in @xmath2 , @xmath3 . here , @xmath4 is a ( known ) source term , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are prescribed initial conditions . at the boundary , @xmath7",

    "we shall now discretize ( [ model_eq_1 ] ) in space by using any one of the following three distinct fe discretizations : continuous ( @xmath12-conforming ) finite elements with mass lumping , a symmetric ip - dg discretization , or a nodal dg method .",

    "since we shall never need to invert @xmath38 , our derivation also applies to the semi - definite case with purely neumann boundary conditions .    usually , the mass matrix @xmath41 is not diagonal , yet needs to be inverted at every time - step of any explicit time integration scheme . to overcome this diffculty ,",

    "hence the implementation is straightforward and requires no special data structures .    in the presence of multi - level mesh refinement ,",
