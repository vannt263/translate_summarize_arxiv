    "recently the t2k collaboration reported @xcite evidence at @xmath1 for a non - zero value of the reactor angle @xmath0 in the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "quantitatively , it was found that @xmath2 at 90% c.l.for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the atmospheric neutrino mass squared difference and mixing angle , and @xmath8 being the dirac cp violating phase in the neutrino mixing matrix ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . under the same conditions the best fit value of @xmath0 obtained from the data analysis is relatively large : @xmath9 .",
    "subsequently the minos collaboration also reported evidence for a relatively large value of @xmath0 , although with a smaller statistical significance @xcite .",
    "a global analysis of the neutrino oscillation data , including the data from the t2k and minos experiments , performed in @xcite showed that actually @xmath10 at @xmath11 .",
    "the authors of @xcite find : @xmath12 using the `` old '' ( `` new '' ) fluxes of reactor @xmath13 in the analysis .",
    "moreover , it was found in the same global analysis that @xmath14 ( and @xmath15 ) is clearly favored by the data over @xmath16 ( and @xmath17   ) .",
    "the t2k and minos results will be tested in the upcoming reactor neutrino experiments double chooz @xcite , daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite . if confirmed , they will have far reaching implications for the program of future research in neutrino physics .",
    "a relatively large value of @xmath0 opens up the possibilities , in particular , i ) for searching for cp violation effects in neutrino oscillations experiments with high intensity accelerator neutrino beams ( like t2k , no@xmath18a , etc . ) ; ii ) for determining the sign of @xmath6 , and thus the type of neutrino mass spectrum , which can be normally or invertedly ordered ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , in the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments at accelerators ( no@xmath18a , etc . ) , in the experiments studying the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as in experiments with reactor antineutrinos @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath19 is a necessary condition for a successful `` flavoured '' leptogenesis when the cp violation required for the generation of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe is provided entirely by the dirac cp violating phase in the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we investigate the possibilities to obtain the relatively large value of @xmath0 , suggested by the t2k , minos and the current global neutrino oscillation data , in the case when the diagonalization of the neutrino mass matrix gives a negligible contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "parametrically the latter means a contribution smaller than @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the cabibbo angle expansion parameter .",
    "the diagonalization of the neutrino mass matrix leads to a negligible @xmath0 , for example , in models with @xmath22 flavour symmetry @xcite and in most models accounting for bimaximal ( bm ) @xcite or tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) @xcite neutrino mixing . for our purposes",
    ", this is equivalent to setting the neutrino mass matrix contribution to @xmath0 to zero , which we will do in our further analysis .",
    "the @xmath0 mixing angle can then be due to the contribution to the neutrino mixing coming from the diagonalization of the charged lepton mass matrix ( see , e.g.  @xcite and the references quoted therein , see @xcite as well as , e.g.  @xcite . ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will consider the possibility of a `` large '' @xmath0 originating from the charged lepton mass matrix in the context of su(5 ) supersymmetric unification .",
    "the motivation for such a choice are strong and well known . in our case",
    ", this choice will also allow to get a handle on the expected contribution to @xmath0 and on the structure of the charged lepton yukawa coupling matrix .",
    "this is because the su(5 ) symmetry allows to relate the latter and the down quark one , on which further experimental information is available .    in minimal",
    "su(5 ) models , the down - quark and transposed charged lepton mass matrices are equal . on the other hand , depending on the ( renormalizable or non - renormalizable )",
    "su(5 ) operator(s ) giving rise to a given yukawa coupling matrix entry , the relation may involve clebsch - gordan ( cg ) coefficients .",
    "such coefficients need to be invoked in order to fix the su(5 ) predictions for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 mass ratios ( unless specific values of @xmath25 , peculiar patterns of susy breaking parameters , or highly asymmetric mass textures are employed  @xcite ) , as shown by the authors of  @xcite after having identified the possible gut scale mass ratios in a bottom - up approach .",
    "all the possible cg coefficients in su(5 ) and the pati  salam group entering such relations arising from dimension five and some dimension six operators are listed in @xcite .",
    "such coefficients not only can give rise to new mass ratios , but can also affect the prediction for @xmath0  @xcite . in this paper , we discuss possible combinations of cg coefficients , which can give a `` large '' @xmath0 even if there is no contribution to @xmath0 from the neutrino mass matrix at all .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the general set up , the determination of the standard neutrino parameters under the assumptions we make , the numerical procedure we used to determine the allowed cg coefficients and the predictions for @xmath0 .",
    "the results are illustrated in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we consider the special case in which the neutrino contribution to the pmns matrix is of the bm or tbm form , in which interesting implications for the leptonic ( dirac ) cp - violation phase can be drawn . in section 5",
    "we summarize .",
    "we start with some definitions and a summary of the assumptions we make regarding the structure of the mixing matrices .",
    "thereby we follow closely the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the pmns lepton mixing matrix @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the charged lepton and light neutrino mass matrices , respectively , and @xmath30 are diagonal and positive .",
    "the pmns matrix can be parameterized in the standard way as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a diagonal phase matrix containing the two physical majorana cp violation phases @xcite .    barring correlations among the entries of @xmath28",
    ", the hierarchy of the charged lepton masses translates into the possibility of diagonalizing @xmath28 perturbatively through subsequent @xmath33 unitary rotations in the following order : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a unitary rotation in the @xmath36 block .",
    "the 13 rotation is negligible for our purposes and will be set to zero , thus @xmath37 .",
    "the assumption of zero neutrino mass matrix contribution to @xmath0 can be rephrased as @xmath38 in the limit of @xmath39 , or equivalently as @xmath40 up to phase matrices .",
    "note that since @xmath41 does not contribute to @xmath0 , the assumption can be further rephrased as @xmath42 here @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a cp - violating phase   @xcite .",
    "the angles @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the phase @xmath44 in the expression ( [ eq : assumption ] ) for @xmath26 can be arranged to lie in the intervals @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] , respectively .    by commuting with the @xmath50 one , the @xmath51-rotation has induced a non vanishing @xmath0 given by @xmath52 note that we have traded here @xmath53 with @xmath7 in the standard parameterization .",
    "note also that the corrections to @xmath50 and @xmath54 induced by @xmath45 are given by [ eq : corrections ] @xmath55    in the case of 3-@xmath18 mixing under discussion , the magnitude of the cp violation effects in neutrino oscillations is determined @xcite by the rephasing invariant associated with the dirac cp violating phase @xmath8 : @xmath56 the rephasing invariant @xmath57 , as is well known , is a directly observable quantity .",
    "it is analogous to the rephasing invariant associated with the dirac phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark mixing matrix , introduced in @xcite . in the standard parametrisation of the pmns matrix we find",
    "@xmath58 using eqs .",
    "( [ jcp ] ) and ( [ eq : assumption ] ) we get @xcite @xmath59 thus , to leading order in @xmath60 we have @xmath61 . by comparing the real part of @xmath62 in the two parameterisations",
    "we conclude that , at the same order , @xmath63      we would like now to study the possibility to generate a @xmath45 large enough to induce a @xmath0 in the range indicated by recent experiments in the context of an su(5 ) grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "the unification assumption is powerful because it allows to relate the charged lepton and down quark yukawa matrices @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "if all the yukawa entries were generated by renormalizable operators and the mssm higgs fields were embedded in @xmath68 and @xmath69 representations only , we would have @xmath70 , leading to wrong predictions for the fermion mass ratios . in the general case one",
    "has instead @xmath71 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath72 depend on the operators from which the yukawa entries arise .",
    "such values can be constrained to belong to a finite set of rational numbers at the price of assuming that each yukawa entry comes at least dominantly from a single renormalizable or non - renormalizable su(5 ) operator . in this case , the possible values of the @xmath72 coefficients are listed in table  [ tab : su5relations ] , see also @xcite .    .",

    "<S> the recent results from t2k and minos experiments point towards a relatively large value of the reactor angle @xmath0 in the lepton sector . in this paper we show how a large @xmath0 can arise from the charged lepton sector alone in the context of an su(5 ) gut . </S>",
