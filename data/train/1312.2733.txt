    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are a small group of peculiar neutron stars ( nss ) that are currently believed to have superhigh magnetic fields",
    "b@xmath8 g , and are hence identified as magnetar candidates @xcite . based on the convective dynamo mechanism , some works have focused on the origin of the internal magnetic fields of magnetars @xcite .",
    "magnetars are considered to be nss and might reasonably be expected to have very small radii r @xmath9 cm , although measured masses of these stars are about 1.4@xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the solar mass @xmath12 2 @xmath13 g. in a common magnetar , the typical internal temperature is @xmath14 k as estimated using the standard cooling mechanism @xciteand its intrinsic superhigh magnetic fields may be produced by the induced magnetic moments of the @xmath15 cooper pairs in an anisotropic neutron superfluid at a moderate lower interior temperatures ( @xmath12 2.38 @xmath16 k)@xcite .",
    "observations show that some sgrs and axps have a thermal type x - ray flux , with the magnitude of average x - ray luminosity @xmath17 @xmath12 1.0@xmath18- 5@xmath19 erg   s@xmath20 .",
    "a ns can be treated as a system of magnetic dipoles ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the polar magnetic field strength ) because of the existence of a @xmath15 neutron superfluid in its interior . in the presence of a background magnetic field ,",
    "the dipoles tend to become aligned in the same direction , which would give rise to a phase transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism in the interior of a ns if the temperature drops below a critical temperature .",
    "superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars may originate from this phase transition and the maximum field strength is about ( 3.0 -4.0 ) @xmath23 g@xcite .    when @xmath24 , direct urca reactions occur rapidly for an arbitrary proton concentration due to the fact that strong magnetic fields can alter matter compositions and increase phase space for protons , with a resulting increase in @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the mean electron number per baryon and @xmath26 is the quantum critical magnetic field @xcite .",
    "after entering the neutrino cooling epoch , the direct urca reaction is the simplest neutrino emission process @xcite . in the interior of a magnetar , where matter is assumed to be totally transparent to neutrinos and antineutrinos , the simple decay of neutrons and successive electron capture take place simultaneously , as required by charge neutrality . in order to provide a detailed view of the actual evolutionary scenario of a magnetar , we should take into consideration the effective electron capture rate @xmath27 ( effective number of electrons captured by one proton per second ) due to the existence of landau levels of charged particles .",
    "the incorrect notion that @xmath28 decreases with increasing @xmath29 in an intense field ( @xmath24 ) has been universally adopted for a long time .",
    "this misunderstanding has arisen because the solution of the non - relativistic electron cyclotron motion equation @xmath30 is wrongly ( or unsuitably ) applied to calculate the energy state density in a relativistic degenerate electron gas .",
    "in addition , in some textbooks on statistical physics , the torus located between the @xmath31-th landau level and the @xmath32-th landau level is ascribed to the @xmath31-th landau level when calculating the statistical weight in momentum space . if so , energy ( or momentum ) will change continuously in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , which is contradictory to the quantization of energy ( see gao et al .",
    "2010 for further details ) . to the contrary",
    ", our point of view is that in the case of an intense magnetic field , the stronger the magnetic field , the higher the fermi energy of electrons released from the magnetic field energy .",
    "the possible interpretations of this viewpoint are also given in ( gao et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath33 2 the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are calculated ; with regard to the relationships between the magnetic fields and landau levels , we put forward our points of view and hypotheses in @xmath33 3.1 ; in @xmath33 3.2 we calculate the magnitude of @xmath36 and give an appropriate initial temperature @xmath37 ; in @xmath33 3.3 a numerical simulation of the whole process of electron capture inside a magnetar is presented ; discussions and conclusions are given in section @xmath38 ; and the formula for the electron fermi energy is deduced briefly in appendix .",
    "as the core density increases , the high electron fermi energy drives electron capture by nuclei and free protons , which reduces @xmath25 and decreases the contribution of the degenerate electrons to the total pressure supporting the core against gravitation collapse . in this paper , we focus on non - relativistic , degenerate nuclear matter and ultra - relativistic , degenerate electrons under @xmath40-equilibrium implying the following relationship among chemical potentials ( called the fermi energies @xmath41)of the particles : @xmath42 , where the neutrino chemical potential is ignored .",
    "we assume that at zero- temperature the ns is @xmath40-stable , but at non - zero temperature ( @xmath43 , @xmath441.38@xmath45 erg   k@xmath20 is the boltzmann constant ) , reactions @xmath46 and @xmath47 proceed near the fermi energies @xmath48 of the participating particles . in the case of 0.5 @xmath49 2@xmath50 , electrons are relativistic , neutrons and protons are non - relativistic , and the following expressions are hold approximately : @xmath51 = 60@xmath52 mev , @xmath53=1.9@xmath54 mev , @xmath55 = 1.29 mev , where @xmath562.8 @xmath57 g   @xmath58 is the standard nuclear density ( see chapter 11 of @xcite .    for the purpose of convenient calculation , we set @xmath59 in our model , yielding @xmath60= 59.4 mev .",
    "however , @xmath61 and the minimum of @xmath2 is not less than the minimum fermi kinetic energy of the outgoing neutrons @xmath51 = 60 mev , otherwise the process of @xmath62 will not occur . solving eq.(9 ) in appendix",
    "gives the expression @xmath28= 40@xmath63 mev when @xmath24 @xcite , where we assign @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( 0.08- 0.11 ) ( see appendix ) . in this paper , the range of @xmath29 is assumed to be ( 0.22346- 3.0)@xmath23 g corresponding to @xmath66 ( 60 -114.85 ) mev , where 0.22346 @xmath23 g is the minimum strength of a superhigh magnetic field denoted as @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath29 drops below @xmath67 , the direct urca process is quenched everywhere in the magnetar interior .",
    "the electron capture rates can be calculated by the following equation : @xmath68 where @xmath69=0.511 mev , @xmath70 k , and other terms appearing in eq .",

    "the rate of the electron capture reaction varies clearly with magnetic field strength : when @xmath88 , @xmath89= 60 mev , the reaction will happen very quickly and the @xmath15 cooper pairs will be destroyed immediately by the outgoing neutrons in this process , which causes anisotropy in the neutron superfluid and causes the induced magnetic field to disappear ; when the magnetic field weakens , the reaction rate becomes smaller ; the reaction will end if the field decreases below @xmath26 . by colliding with the neutrons produced in the process @xmath90 ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the outgoing neutrons will be transformed into thermal energy and then transformed into radiation energy via soft x - ray and @xmath91-ray emission @xcite .",
    "however , the values of @xmath34 in table 1 are too large to represent the full extent of electron capture in the interior of a magnetar .",

    "further , electrons and protons would be depleted within a few minutes , which is not consistent with the actual circumstances in a neutron star interior . instead ,",
    "@xmath25 decreases insignificantly in the whole process of electron capture , and the mean value of @xmath25 of a neutron star is @xmath12 0.05 and is comparatively stable , which implies that the electron capture reaction proceeds very slowly due to the existence of landau levels . in accordance with the pauli exclusion principle , electrons are situated in disparate landau levels from the lowest energy state ( the ground energy state ) up to the highest energy state ( the fermi energy state ) , individually with the overwhelming majority occupying @xmath94 landau levels . only the electrons occupying large landau levels with high energy ( @xmath1 ) are allowed to participate in the direct urca process @xcite . in other words , whether an electron could be captured depends not only on the electron s energy @xmath95 but also on the number of the landau level it occupies . in eq.(1 ) , @xmath95 must be treated as a continuous function , otherwise @xmath34 can not be calculated by using discrete landau levels .",

    "we present different methods and considerations .      for extremely strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the cyclotron energy of an electron becomes comparable to its rest - mass energy , and the transverse motion electron becomes relativistic .",
    "we can define a critical magnetic field ( often called the relativistic magnetic field ) @xmath26 by the relation @xmath96 which gives @xmath97= 4.414@xmath98 g. in the case of @xmath99 , solving the relativistic dirac equation for electrons gives the electron energy levels @xcite : @xmath100^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is directed along the @xmath101-axis , quantum number @xmath102 is given by @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the landau level number , and spin @xmath105 is the @xmath101-component of the electron momentum . combining @xmath97 with @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath107 with @xmath108 0.927 @xmath109 erg   g@xmath20 being the magnetic moment of an electron . from eq.(4 ) , for electrons in a given landau level , @xmath95 increases with @xmath110 ; if the value of @xmath110 is invariable , @xmath95 increases with increasing landau level number @xmath31 . in terms of the relation between the magnetic fields and landau levels , our points of view and hypotheses are as follows :    1 .",
    "firstly , for electrons ( or protons ) in an intense magnetic field , the maximum landau level number , @xmath111 , decreases with increasing magnetic field strength @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is very difficult to calculate exactly @xmath111 occupied by a homogeneous gas of cold electrons ( or protons ) in a given field , and so we can only estimate it . considering this limitation ,",
    "we define a quantity @xmath112 , the ratio of the electron number in higher landau levels to that in all landau levels , written as @xmath113 where @xmath31 denotes the number of the lowest landau level ( not the ground landau level ) , below which electrons can not be captured .",
    "2 .   secondly , in the core of a ns , charge neutrality gives @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , whenever the magnetic field significantly affects the electrons , it also affects the protons , thus the values of @xmath111 for electrons and protons are essentially the same in a given magnetic field @xcite .",
    "similarly , we define the quantity @xmath115 as the ratio of the proton number in higher landau levels to that in all landau levels , whose expression is the same as that of @xmath112 .",
    "we firstly introduce the landau level effect coefficient @xmath116 , and the effective electron capture rate @xmath5 is then defined as : @xmath117 3 .   finally , in the vicinity of the fermi surface , the electrons with the same energy @xmath0 could come from different landau levels because the electrons are degenerate .",
    "however , the electrons occupying lower landau levels can not be captured even if their energies are higher than the threshold reaction energy ; for higher landau levels , there still exist some electrons with lower energies @xmath0 ( @xmath118 ) that are not captured .    in order to determine the order of magnitude of the landau level effect coefficient @xmath36 and to estimate the maximum landau level number @xmath119 as accurately as possible , we should firstly rewrite eq.(4 ) , as demonstrated in @xmath33 3.2 .",
    "we must modify @xmath34 by introducing @xmath4 considering that the symmetry is broken in the momentum space caused by the superhigh magnetic fields .",
    "when @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 = 0.511 mev , eq.(4 ) can be well approximated as @xmath123 degenerate electron gas is distributed exponentially ( a maxwell distribution)@xcite , so we define @xmath124 where @xmath125 denotes the number of electrons in the @xmath31-th landau level .",
    "when @xmath126 g , @xmath127 k , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 10 . from these evaluations , it is clear that @xmath131 , so @xmath132 1 . according to the pauli exclusion principle , @xmath133 , here @xmath134 and@xmath135 are electron state density , electron number density , respectively .",
    "suppose @xmath136 0.9@xmath135 in the ground state landau level , then @xmath137 0.9 . since @xmath138 @xmath58 @xcite and @xmath139 1 , @xmath119 is estimated to be @xmath12 several or @xmath12 10 .",
    "it is important to note that , in a non - relativistic weak field , the electron cyclotron energy is @xmath140 = 11.5 @xmath141 kev , the maximum landau level number @xmath142 or higher , where @xmath141 is magnetic field in units of @xmath143 g ; also , in the case of a weakly quantizing relativistic strong magnetic field ( @xmath144 g ) , the solution of non - relativistic electron cyclotron motion equation @xmath30 is no longer suitable , but if this equation is used , the rest mass of an electron @xmath145 must be replaced by its effective mass @xmath146 , which is far larger than the former after taking into account the effect of relativity . in this latter case @xmath119 could be estimated to be @xmath1210 or higher , rather than 0 or 1 , which shows our evaluations are reasonable . from the above discussion , we obtain the following approximate relationship : @xmath147 thus the electron number in the lowest landau level can be accurately approximated by @xmath148 if we want to determine @xmath149 , the value of @xmath150 should be calculated first .",

    "next , a way of calculating the value of any @xmath150 in eq.(6 ) is introduced as follows . for example , in the case of @xmath29 = 3.0@xmath23 g and @xmath31= 5 , firstly , we calculate the values of @xmath150 corresponding to @xmath155= 1 and @xmath155 = -1 , respectively , by using eq.(6 ) , then calculate the mean value of @xmath156 113.96 mev . from the analysis above , the effective electron capture @xmath5 can be expressed as : @xmath157 ^ 2\\gamma .\\ ] ]    the steady x - ray emission ( @xmath158 erg   s@xmath20 ) could be from the magnetar interior @xcite .",

    "for instance , the neutrino emissivity @xmath201 can be calculated by eq.(14 ) of @xcite as follows : @xmath202 where @xmath203 k , @xmath204 and @xmath205 are nucleon effective masses in dense matter , @xmath206 , @xmath207=1.436@xmath208 erg   @xmath163 is the fermi weak coupling constant , @xmath209 is the cabibbo angle , @xmath210= 1.261 is the axial - vector coupling constant , @xmath211 is the field - free emissivity , the factor @xmath212 describes the effect of the magnetic field . in eq.(18 ) , @xmath213 is @xmath214 and @xmath29 can be as high as @xmath215 g , but is not discussed ( here the range of @xmath29 is 0@xmath12 3@xmath216 g ) .",
    "thus the value of @xmath213(@xmath217 0.086 mev , when @xmath218 k ) is far less than those of table 1 in @xmath33 2 , and the range of @xmath29 is not consistent with that of our model .",
    "we therefore ask what is the essential difference between @xmath219 of the direct urca reaction and that of the modified urca reaction ( in the process of a modified urca reaction , @xmath220 ) .",
    "it is universally acknowledged that the neutrino emissivity of the modified urca reaction is about six orders of magnitude smaller than that of the direct urca reaction .",
    "may this be because of the increase of the number of particles participating in the direct urca reaction while the average kinetic energy of the outgoing neutrinos @xmath75 is invariable in both cases ?",
    "ultrastrong magnetic fields can generate a noticeable magnetic broadening of the direct urca process threshold and the thresholds of other reactions in a magnetar interior @xcite .",
    "however , the modified urca process are negligible if the direct urca process is allowed . what is more , it is easy to imagine that the neutrino flux comes from the thermal energy in the magnetar interior , rather than from the free energy of the superhigh magnetic field , if @xmath220 is used in the direct urca reaction .",
    "there exist many different cooling mechanisms , including neutrino emission , inside a ns . in the direct urca reaction , @xmath75 and @xmath7",
    "are ultimately determined by @xmath29 , and are weak functions of @xmath168 , which is only equivalent to background temperature and decreases with decreasing @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath3decay and related reactions in strong magnetic fields have been investigated since the late 1960s ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . despite this previous research ,",
    "existing analysis is approximate and many assumptions are invoked consequently , because our computational methods are completely new approaches , that need to be validated empirically . by using eq.(11 ) , schematic diagrams of the neutrino luminosity @xmath7 as a function of magnetic field strength @xmath29 are shown in figure 1    from table 1 and tables 4 - 5 , we find that the neutrino luminosity @xmath7 is also a weak function of the background temperature @xmath168 .",
    "the schematic diagrams of the neutrino luminosity @xmath7 versus the background temperature @xmath168 are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2 illustrates that the neutrino emission decreases with falling temperature .",
    "the relationship between magnetic field strength @xmath29 and the background temperature @xmath168 is shown in figure 3 , based on the data in tables 4 - 5 .",
    "figure 3 shows that the direct urca reaction proceeds as long as the magnetic field @xmath29 is high than the critical value @xmath26 corresponding to the minimum value of the background temperature @xmath168 in the core , and when @xmath168 falls further with decreasing @xmath29 to below the critical value , the neutrino luminosity and direct urca process are quenched everywhere in the core .",
    "it should be noted that the surface temperature is controlled by crustal physics , and is independent of the evolution of the core . in these three figures , @xmath29 is assumed to be in the range 2.24@xmath57 g -3.0@xmath23 g. note that when @xmath221 , the direct urca processes cease , while the modified urca processes still occur , producing the weaker x - ray and neutrino flux .",
    "in this paper , we introduce an approximate method for investigating the effects of landau levels on the evolution of a superhigh magnetic field , and also numerically simulate the process of magnetar cooling and magnetic field decay .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the effect of a superhigh magnetic field would be to speed up the cooling of magnetar .",
    "when @xmath29 decays , the values of @xmath34 , @xmath168 and @xmath25 decrease , but@xmath222 could be very small .",
    "\\2 . in the magnetar interior",
    ", the @xmath15 cooper pairs will be destroyed quickly by the outgoing neutrons via the process of electron capture , so the induced magnetic field will disappear .",
    "the abnormal x - ray flux @xmath6 and neutrino flux @xmath223 come from the free energy of the superhigh magnetic field , not from the thermal energy in the core of magnetar , and are all ultimately determined by the magnetic field strength .    finally , we are hopeful that our assumptions and numerical simulations can be combined with observations in the future , to provide a deeper understanding of the nature of the superhigh magnetic fields of magnetars .",
