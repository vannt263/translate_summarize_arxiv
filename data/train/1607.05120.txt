    "logical proofs are static and certain .",
    "computations are dynamic and uncertain ( will the program stop ? will it return a correct result ? ) .",
    "it is a striking discovery that the two coincide : logical proofs can be seen as , and actually are , certified computer programs .",
    "each logical inference corresponds to a natural construct of a functional programming language , so that _ proofs become programs _ and _ formulas can be read as types _ of programs .",
    "this correspondence , known as curry ",
    "howard isomorphism , has deeply influenced both proof theory and computer science .",
    "proof theory set as one of its goals to interpret rules in deductive systems as program instructions ; computer science in turn regarded curry ",
    "howard correspondence as the foundation for functional programming languages , ensuring termination and correctness of programs .",
    "the curry ",
    "howard correspondence was first discovered for constructive proofs , and in particular for intuitionistic natural deduction and typed @xmath1-calculus @xcite .",
    "it was later extended to classical proofs , despite they may use ineffective principles such as the excluded middle , pierce s law or the axiom of countable choice .",
    "the first work in this direction was made by griffin @xcite , who showed that pierce s law corresponds to the so - called control operators , widely used in programming languages .",
    "parigot @xcite later introduced the @xmath2-calculus , which relates to classical natural deduction as the @xmath1-calculus relates to intuitionistic natural deduction . nowadays various different logics ( linear , modal , temporal ... ) have been related to many different notions of computation ; the list is long , and we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "an interesting contribution was provided by danos and krivine @xcite .",
    "using krivine s notion of realizability for classical logic @xcite , they proposed a concurrent reading of a family of non - constructive logical principles in terms of synchronization protocols .",
    "these principles are disjunctive classical tautologies ; a main example is dummett s linearity axiom @xmath3 whose corresponding rule is explained operationally in @xcite as a form of communication between processes .",
    "this interpretation , however , falls short of capturing the constructive content of @xmath4 .",
    "it is not surprising : a computational interpretation of classical logic can not be refined enough to provide the _",
    "best _ computational reading of each of its theorems .",
    "the reason is that the same interpretation must apply to all of them , including those which are far less constructive than the linearity axiom , such as the reductio ad absurdum .",
    "the linearity axiom arises in various contexts .",
    "in particular , its addition to intuitionistic logic leads to gdel logic @xmath5 @xcite , arguably one of the most useful and interesting logics intermediate between intuitionistic and classical logic .",
    "in contrast with intuitionistic logic , whose validity problem is pspace - complete , @xmath5 is np - complete ; moreover , due to the natural interpretation of its connectives as functions over the real interval @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath5 is a main fuzzy logic @xcite .",
    "twenty - five years have gone by since avron @xcite conjectured that @xmath5 might provide a basis for parallel @xmath1-calculi . despite the interest of the conjecture and despite various attempts , no curry ",
    "howard correspondence has so far been provided .",
    "the reason is that the traditional way to provide a curry ",
    "howard correspondence for a logic goes through _ natural deduction_. gentzen @xcite introduced it with the aim of describing directly mathematical reasoning , which may explain why natural deduction inferences can be naturally interpreted as program instructions , in particular as typed @xmath1-terms .",
    "normalization  @xcite , which corresponds to the execution of the resulting programs , can then be used to obtain analytic proofs , those proofs only containing formulas that are subformulas of some of the hypotheses or of the conclusion .",
    "but the problem of finding a natural deduction for gdel logic with this property , called analyticity , looked hopeless for decades because the linearity axiom , despite being non - constructive , demands a sophisticated constructive interpretation .",
    "and meanwhile a very successful competitor entered the scene , a proof system that immediately attracted almost all the attention of the proof theory community interested in gdel logic .",
    "it is avron s hypersequent calculus @xcite .",
    "sequent calculi , normally , deal with derivability assertions @xmath7 , rather than just formulas .",
    "the hypersequent calculus jumps one step further and uses hypersequents , that is , sequents operating in parallel : @xmath8 this additional structure allows the definition of new rules permitting interaction between parallel sequents .",
    "the key rule introduced by avron to capture the linearity axiom  called _ communication _  intuitively enables sequents to exchange their information and , in this sense , communicate . however , a precise formalization of this intuitive interpretation of gdel logic as a logic for parallelism is far from easy .",
    "there are various attempts in the literature to prove avron s conjecture .",
    "all the approaches explored so far try to devise forms of natural deduction whose structures mirror hypersequents .",
    "this is the case of the hyper natural deduction for first - order @xmath5 in @xcite . the normalization theorem , however ,",
    "is obtained there only by translation into avron s calculus , followed by cut - elimination and backward translation : no reduction rules for hyper deductions were provided and no corresponding @xmath1-calculus has been introduced .",
    "the former task was carried out in @xcite , who formulated a propositional hyper natural deduction with a normalization procedure .",
    "the definition of a corresponding @xmath1-calculus and curry  howard correspondence are left as an open problem , which might have a complex solution due to the elaborated structure of hyper deductions .",
    "another attempt along the `` hyper line '' has been made in @xcite .",
    "however , not only the proposed proof system is not shown to be analytic , but the associated @xmath1-calculus is not a curry  howard isomorphism : computation rules of the @xmath1-calculus are not related to proof transformations , in other words _ subject reduction _ does not hold .",
    "hypersequents have been very influential , but nothing in principle prevented the existence of a simple natural deduction for @xmath5 with clear operation meaning and departing from the `` hyper approach '' .",
    "we present indeed an analytic natural deduction @xmath10 and a curry ",
    "howard correspondence for propositional @xmath5 , thus resolving the long - standing avron conjecture .",
    "we add to the @xmath1-calculus an operator that , from the programming viewpoint , represents parallel computations and communications between them ; from the logical viewpoint , the linearity axiom ; and from the proof theory viewpoint , the hypersequent separator among sequents .",
    "we call the resulting calculus @xmath9 : parallel @xmath1-calculus for @xmath5 .",

    "the natural deduction calculus @xmath10 that we use as type system for @xmath9 is particularly simple : it is obtained by extending @xmath11 with the following communication rule @xmath13 @xmath14{c}{\\infer*{c}{[a { \\rightarrow}b ] } & & \\infer*{c}{[b { \\rightarrow}a]}}\\ ] ] -0.1 in which allows us to conclude unconditionally @xmath15 from two different deductions of @xmath15 : one from the hypothesis @xmath16 and one from the hypothesis @xmath17 .",
    "note that in actual mathematical practice the excluded middle principle is used in a similar way : if from @xmath18 follows @xmath15 , and from @xmath19 follows @xmath15 , we can finally conclude @xmath15 .",
    "the above rule was first considered in @xcite to define a natural deduction calculus for @xmath5 , but with no normalization procedure , and in @xcite to prove herbrand s theorem for dummett s first - order logic .",
    "the calculus @xmath10 follows the basic principle of natural deduction that _",
    "new axioms require new computational reductions _ ; this contrasts with the basic principle of sequent calculus employed in the `` hyper approach '' , that _",
    "new axioms require new deduction structures_. hence we keep the calculus simple and deal with the complexity of the hypersequent structure on the operational side .",
    "consequently , the programs corresponding to @xmath10 proofs maintain the amazing syntactical simplicity of @xmath1-calculus .",
    "this is essential , because we want to reason efficiently about those programs and to prove their complex combinatorial properties , like normalization .",
    "this last requires in @xmath10 a sophisticated extension of prawitz s normalization method @xcite , featuring also ideas inspired by the embedding between hypersequents and systems of rules in @xcite and by the cut - elimination method for hypersequent calculi .",
    "the inference rules of @xmath10 are decorated with @xmath9-terms , so that we can directly read proofs as typed programs .",
    "the decoration of the @xmath11 inferences is standard and the typed version of @xmath13 is @xmath14{u \\parallel_{a } v : c}{\\infer*{u : c}{[a^{\\scriptscriptstyle a\\rightarrow b } : a\\rightarrow b ] } & & \\infer*{v : c}{[a^{\\scriptscriptstyle b\\rightarrow a } : b\\rightarrow a]}}\\ ] ] the parallel operator @xmath20 is inspired by the exception operator of  @xcite in that it keeps using the variable @xmath21 for communication purposes .",
    "the computational reductions associated to @xmath20  _ cross reductions _  can be naturally interpreted in terms of programming techniques .",
    "it provides a logically motivated basis for parallel programming that includes aspects of synchronous message passing @xcite , code mobility  @xcite and code optimization . in principle",
    ", a cross reduction can be activated whenever a communication channel @xmath21 is ready to transfer information between two parallel processes : @xmath22\\parallel_{a } \\mathcal{d}[a\\ , v]\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is a process containing a fragment of code @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a process containing a fragment of code @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 has to send @xmath24 through the channel @xmath21 to @xmath25 , which in turn needs to send @xmath26 through @xmath21 to @xmath23 . in several situations it might be inefficient , if possible at all , to evaluate the programs @xmath24 and @xmath26 before sending them :",
    "for example , the result of the computation might take too much space to be sent or too much time to be produced  @xcite .",
    "cross reductions solve the problem using the code mobility technique of _ process migration _ : @xmath24 and @xmath26 enter the communication channel and exchange their location .",
    "since some resources that remained in the old computational environment may be inaccessible from the new locations of @xmath24 and @xmath26 , the reduction creates a new communication channel for these resources .",
    "this is an example of a _ migration mechanism _ handling the bindings between code fragments and their computational environments @xcite .",
    "the reduction can also be seen as performing code optimization .",
    "we can communicate @xmath24 and @xmath26 and partially execute them  exploiting their new location  even before their input is actually provided .",
    "the code is hence more efficient and can be executed when the input is given .",
    "gdel logic @xmath5 , also known as gdel ",

    "the negation @xmath18 can be introduced , as usual , as a shorthand for @xmath30 ; following @xcite , the disjunction @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 .",
    "although at the propositional level @xmath5 results by simply adding the linearity axiom @xmath33 @xmath0 to any proof calculus for intuitionistic logic , an analytic calculus for @xmath5 can not be defined by simply extending the sequent calculus _ lj _ or the natural deduction @xmath11 for intuitionistic logic with suitable rules capturing the linearity axioms @xcite .",
    "analytic calculi for @xmath5 have indeed been defined using formalisms extending the sequent calculus ; these include the hypersequent calculus @xcite , labelled deductive systems @xcite , sequent of relations and relational hypersequents @xcite . among them ,",
    "arguably , the most successful calculus for @xmath5 is the hypersequent calculus in @xcite .",
    "this calculus can indeed be naturally extended with quantifier rules ( first - order and propositional quantifiers ) and was used to prove various results such as the mid-(hyper)sequent theorem , or the elimination of the density rule from derivations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in general a hypersequent calculus is defined by incorporating a sequent calculus ( gentzen s _ lj _ , in case of @xmath5 ) as a sub - calculus and adding an additional layer of information by considering a single sequent to live in the context of finite multisets of sequents ( called hypersequents ) .",
    "a * hypersequent * is a multiset of sequents , written as @xmath34 where , for all @xmath35 @xmath36 is an ordinary sequent .",
    "the symbol `` @xmath37 '' is intended to denote disjunction at the meta - level ; this is reflected by the presence in the calculus of the external structural rules of weakening and contraction , operating on whole sequents , rather than on formulas .",
    "the hypersequent design opens the possibility of defining new rules that allow to `` exchange information '' between different sequents .",
    "it is this type of rules which increases the expressive power of hypersequent calculi compared to ordinary sequent calculi .",
    "the additional rule employed in avron s calculus for @xmath5 @xcite is the so called _ communication rule _ , below presented in a slightly reformulated version ( as usual @xmath38 stands for a possibly empty hypersequent ) : @xmath39 in his paper avron suggested to interpret hypersequents as multiprocesses and the communication rule as a type of communication mechanism between them .",
    "hence he conjectured that @xmath5 could serve as base for a suitable form of parallel @xmath1-calculus .",
