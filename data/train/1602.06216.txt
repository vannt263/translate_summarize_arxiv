    "a significant experimental and theoretical effort has concentrated on studies of this issue in fe - hts s . however , there is no consensus on a universal gap structure and the relevance for the particular gap symmetry for high - temperature superconductivity in iron - based high temperature superconductors ( fe - hts s ) , which are the first non - cuprate materials exhibiting superconductivity at relatively high temperatures .",
    "in contrast to cuprates , where the sc gap symmetry is universal the gap symmetry and/or structure of the fe - hts s can be quite different from material to material .",
    "for instance , nodeless isotropic gap distributions were observed in optimally doped ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 , ba@xmath2rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 and bafe@xmath16ni@xmath10as@xmath4 as well as in bafe@xmath16co@xmath10as@xmath4 , k@xmath10fe@xmath17se@xmath4 and fete@xmath2se@xmath10 @xcite .",

    "it was found that this phase diagram is very similar to the thoroughly studied system ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the particularly interesting observation in ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 is the systematic doping evolution of the nodal structure for heavy hole - doping @xcite . at around",
    "optimal doping @xmath5 = 0.4 , where @xmath13 has a maximum value of 38 k , many experiments revealed the occurrence of multiple isotropic sc gaps .",
    "a sign changing @xmath18-wave state which is mediated by spin fluctuations has been invoked to explain some of the experimental results . however",
    ", this state is expected to be very fragile to the presence of nonmagnetic impurities , while fe - hts s are experimentally known to be robust against nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "a no - sign changing @xmath19-wave state mediated by orbital fluctuations and which is robust against nonmagnetic impurities is another possible candidate for the pairing in this system .",
    "hence , the sc pairing symmetry in the optimum region is still an open question .",
    "however , there is consensus that the sc gap structure itself is fully gapped for optimally doped samples of ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting that in this system , the crossover from nodeless to nodal sc state occurs at @xmath5 @xmath20 0.8 .",
    "these changes were related to a lifshitz transition , reflecting the disappearance of the electron pockets in the fermi surface ( fs ) , at similar k - doping levels @xcite ( unlike optimally doped ba@xmath21k@xmath22fe@xmath4as@xmath4 which has both electron and hole - fss , only hole - fss were found in the extremely hole - doped kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite ) .",
    "the nodeless sc gaps were also observed in ba@xmath2rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 at optimal doping @xmath5 = 0.3 , 0.35 , 0.4 from the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath23 by means of muon - spin rotation ( @xmath24sr ) @xcite .",

    "it is important to study the sc gap symmetry in over - doped ba@xmath2rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 .    besides doping another important tuning parameter",
    "is the hydrostatic pressure which leads to new and in some materials very exotic physical properties , pressure induced phase transitions as well as changes of the characteristic sc or magnetic quantities @xcite . in kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 , a change of the sc pairing symmetry by hydrostatic pressure has been proposed , based on the @xmath26-shaped pressure dependence of @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "thus , it is important to study the pressure effects on the sc properties of over - doped ba@xmath2rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 system in order to have a picture about the pressure effects on different regions of the phase diagram .    in the following we report on @xmath24sr studies of the temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xmath23 in over - doped ba@xmath28rb@xmath29fe@xmath4as@xmath4 at ambient and under hydrostatic pressures up to @xmath6 = 2.3 gpa .",

    "application of pressure of @xmath6 = 2.3 gpa causes a decrease of its value by 15 @xmath11 in optimally doped sample @xmath5 = 0.35 , while only very tiny decrease of @xmath23(0 ) is observed for the over - doped system @xmath5 = 0.65 . instead , for the end member compound an increase of @xmath23(0 ) with pressure is observed .",
    "this means that the @xmath119(0)/@xmath118 is negative and large for @xmath5 = 0.35 . on further increasing the @xmath5 to 0.65 it",
    "s magnitude becomes negligibly small but is still negative and becomes positive for the end member @xmath5 = 1 .",
    "so , the sign change of @xmath119(0)/@xmath118 takes place for some the @xmath5 values located between @xmath5 = 0.65 and 1 .",
    "the above results provide clear evidence that the sc gap symmetry as well as the pressure effects on @xmath13 and on @xmath23(0 ) strongly depends on doping level @xmath5 .",
    "note that in the optimally doped 122-system ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 several bands cross the fermi surface ( fs ) @xcite .",
    "they consist of inner ( @xmath89 ) and outer ( @xmath121 ) hole - like bands , both centered at the zone center @xmath122 , and an electron - like band ( @xmath123 ) centered at the m point .",
    "band structure of ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 changes are associated with hole doping .",
    "the hole fermi surfaces expand with increasing @xmath5 , whereas electron fermi surfaces shrink gradually and disappear for @xmath5 @xmath47 0.6 , giving rise to a lifshitz transition . since , the investigated system is very similar to ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 , one expects similar doping induced changes in the band structure in both materials .",
    "hence , the @xmath5 dependence of the sc gap symmetry as well as the pressure effects , reported above for ba@xmath2rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 , may be related to this putative lifshitz transition .",
    "in summary , the sc properties of optimally and over - doped ba@xmath2rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( @xmath101 and 0.65 ) samples at ambient pressure were studied by means of magnetization , specific heat and @xmath24sr experiments .",
    "in addition , the @xmath5 = 0.65 specimen was investigated under hydrostatic pressures up to @xmath6 = 2.3 gpa through zero - field and transverse field @xmath24sr experiments . while the specific heat jump for the @xmath5 = 0.35 sample follows the so called bnc scalling , the heavily over - doped ba@xmath2rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 shows a deviation from the bnc scaling as it was observed for the related ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 system .",
    "in contrast to nodeless sc gap observed in the optimally doped sample @xmath5 = 0.35 , the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath23 suggests a @xmath8-wave sc gap in over - doped system @xmath5 = 0.65 .",
    "the @xmath8-wave symmetry is preserved under hydrostatic pressures up to @xmath6 = 2.3 gpa , indicating the robustness of the @xmath8-wave symmetry in the over - doped region .",
    "the fact that the rather stable @xmath8-wave symmetry was also observed in the optimally - doped sample @xmath5 = 0.35 under pressure indicates that both tuning parameters , heavy hole doping and hydrostatic pressure , promote the same pairing mechanism for superconductivity in @xmath124rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "the values of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath23 , @xmath13 as well as the @xmath8-wave gap @xmath14 and the ratio @xmath125 show a small and monotonic decrease with increasing the pressure . by combining the present data with those previously obtained for the optimally doped system @xcite and for the end member rbfe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite we conclude that the sc gap symmetry as well as the pressure effects on the quantities characterizing the sc state strongly depends on the hole doping level @xmath5 .",
    "the combined results may be interpreted by assuming a disappearance of the electron pocket from the fermi surface upon the high hole doping , resulting in a lifshitz transition .",
    "note that the absence of the @xmath123 electron pocket has been observed by arpes in the related system kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite . finally",
    ", we suggest that the ba@xmath2rb@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 and ba@xmath2k@xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 superconducting series have a common doping dependence of the sc properties . the present results may help to explore the microscopic mechanism responsible for the observed non - universaltiy of the sc gap structure in the fe - hts s .",
