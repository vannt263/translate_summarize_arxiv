    "let @xmath0 be a domain in the euclidean space @xmath1 , @xmath2 be its boundary and @xmath3 be a differentiable function .",
    "a _ critical point _ of @xmath4 is a point in @xmath0 at which the gradient @xmath5 of @xmath4 is the zero vector .",
    "the importance of critical points is evident . at an elementary level , they help us to visualize the graph of @xmath4 , since they are some of its notable points ( they are local maximum , minimum , or inflection / saddle points of @xmath4 ) . at a more sophisticated level , if we interpret @xmath4 and @xmath5 as a gravitational , electrostatic or velocity potential and its underlying field of force or flow , the critical points are the positions of equilibrium for the field of force or stagnation points for the flow and give information on the topology of the equipotential lines or of the curves of steepest descent ( or stream lines ) related to @xmath4",
    ".    a merely differentiable function can be very complicated .",
    "for instance , whitney @xcite constructed a non - constant function of class @xmath6 on the plane with a connected set of critical values ( the images of critical points ) .",
    "if we allow enough smoothness , this is no longer possible as morse - sard s lemma informs us : indeed , if @xmath4 is at least of class @xmath7 , the set of its critical values must have zero lebesgue measure and hence the regular values of @xmath4 must be dense in the image of @xmath4 ( see @xcite for a proof ) .    when the function @xmath4 is the solution of some partial differential equation , the situation improves . in this survey , we shall consider the four archetypical equations : @xmath8 that is the _ laplace s _ equation , the _ torsional creep _ equation , the _ eigenfunction _ equation and the _ heat _ equation",
    ".    it should be noticed at this point some important differences between the first and the remaining three equations .",
    "one is that the critical points of harmonic functions  the solutions of the laplace s equation  are always `` saddle points '' as it is suggested by the maximum and minimum principles and the fact that @xmath9 is the sum of the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath10 .",
    "the other three equations instead admit solutions with maximum or minimum points .    also , we know that the critical points of a non - constant harmonic function @xmath4 on an open set of @xmath11 are isolated and can be assigned a sort of finite multiplicity , for they are the zeroes of the holomorphic function @xmath12 . by means of the theory of quasi - conformal mappings and generalized analytic functions ,",
    "this result can be extended to solutions of the elliptic equation @xmath13 ( with suitable smoothness assumptions on the coefficients ) or even to weak solutions of the an elliptic equation in divergence form , @xmath14 even allowing discontinuous coefficients .    instead",
    ", solutions of the other three equations can show curves of critical points in @xmath11 , as one can be persuaded by looking at the solution of the torsional creep equation in a circular annulus with zero boundary values .",
    "these discrepancies extend to any dimension @xmath15 , in the sense that it has been shown that the set of the critical points of a non - constant harmonic function ( or of a solution of an elliptic equation with smooth coefficients modeled on the laplace equation ) has at most locally finite @xmath16-dimensional hausdorff measure , while solutions of equations fashioned on the other three equations have at most locally finite @xmath17-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "further assumptions on solutions of a partial differential equation , such as their behaviour on the boundary and the shape of the boundary itself , can give more detailed information on the number and location of critical points .",
    "in these notes , we shall consider the case of harmonic functions with various boundary behaviors and the solutions @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the following three problems : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a given function .",
    "we will refer to , , - , as the _ torsional creep problem _ , the _ dirichlet eigenvalue problem _ , and the _ initial - boundary value problem for the heat equation _ , respectively .",
    "a typical situation is that considered in theorem [ th : am1b ] : a harmonic function @xmath4 on a planar domain @xmath0 is given together with a vector field @xmath25 on @xmath2 of assigned topological degree @xmath26 ; the number of critical points in @xmath0 then is bounded in terms of @xmath26 , the euler characteristic of @xmath0 and the number of proper connected components of the set @xmath27 ( see theorem [ th : am1b ] for the exact statement ) .",
    "we shall also see how this type of theorem has recently been extended to obtain a bound for the number of critical points of the li - tam green s function of a non - compact riemanniann surface of finite type in terms of its genus and the number of its ends .    owing to the theory of quasi - conformal mappings , theorem [ th : am1b ] can be extended to solutions of quite general elliptic equations and , thanks to the work of g. alessandrini and co - authors , has found effective applications to the study of inverse problems that have as a common denominator the reconstruction of the coefficients of an elliptic equation in a domain from measurements on the boundary of a set of its solutions .",
    "a paradigmatic example is that of electric impedence tomography ( eit ) in which a conductivity @xmath28 is reconstructed , as the coefficient of the elliptic equation @xmath29 from the so - called neumann - to - dirichlet ( or dirichlet - to - neumann ) operator on @xmath2 . in physical terms , an electrical current ( represented by the co - normal derivative @xmath30 ) is applied on @xmath2 generating a potential @xmath4 , that is measured on @xmath2 within a certain error .",
    "one wants to reconstruct the conductivity @xmath28 from some of these measurements . roughly speaking",
    ", one has to solve for the unknown @xmath28 the first order differential equation @xmath31 once the information about @xmath4 has been extended from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that such an equation is singular at the critical points of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , it is helpful to know _ a priori _ that @xmath5 does not vanish and this can be done via ( appropriate generalizations of ) theorem [ th : am1b ] by choosing suitable currents on @xmath2 .",
    "the possible presence of maximum and/or minimum points for the solutions of , , or - makes the search for an estimate of the number of critical points a difficult task ( even in the planar case ) .",
    "in fact , the mere topological information only results in an estimate of the _ signed sum _ of the critical points , the sign depending on whether the relevant critical point is an extremal or saddle point .",
    "for example , for the solution of or , we only know that the difference between the number of its ( isolated ) maximum and saddle points ( minimum points are not allowed ) must equal @xmath32 , the _ euler characteristic _ of @xmath0  a morse - type theorem .",
    "thus , further assumptions , such as geometric information on @xmath0 , are needed .",
    "more information is also necessary even if we consider the case of harmonic functions in dimension @xmath33 .    in the author s knowledge , results on the number of critical points of solutions of , , or - reduce to deduction that their solutions admit a",
    "critical point if @xmath0 is _",
    "convex_. moreover , the proof of such results is somewhat indirect : the solution is shown to be _ quasi - concave _  indeed , log - concave for the cases of and - , and @xmath34-concave for the case  and then its analyticity completes the argument .",
    "estimates of the number of critical points when the domain @xmath0 has more complex geometries would be a significant advance . in this survey",
    ", we will propose and justify some conjectures .",
    "the problem of locating critical points is also an interesting issue . the first work on this subject dates back to gauss @xcite , who proved that the critical points of a complex polynomial are its , if they are multiple , and the equilibrium points of the gravitational field of force generated by particles placed at the zeroes and with masses proportional to the zeroes multiplicities ( see section [ sec : location ] ) .",
    "later refinements are due to jensen @xcite and lucas @xcite , but the first treatises on this matter are marden s book @xcite and , primarily , walsh s monograph @xcite that collects most of the results on the number and location of critical points of complex polynomials and harmonic functions known at that date . in general dimension , even for harmonic functions ,",
    "results are sporadic and rely on explicit formulae or symmetry arguments .    two well known questions in this context concern the location of the _ hot spot _ in a heat conductor  a hot spot is a point of ( absolute or relative ) maximum temperature in the conductor .",
    "the situation described by - corresponds with the case of a _ grounded _ conductor . by some asymptotic analysis , under appropriate assumptions on @xmath24",
    ", one can show that the hot spots _",
    "originate _ from the set of maximum points of the function @xmath35  the distance of @xmath36 from @xmath2  and tend to the maximum points of the unique positive solution of , as @xmath37 . in the case",
    "@xmath0 is convex , we have only one hot spot , as already observed . in section [ sec : location ] , we will describe three techniques to locate it ; some of them extend their validity to locate the maximum points of the solutions to and .",
    "we will also give an account of what it is known about convex conductors that admit a stationary hot spot ( that is the hot spot does not move with time ) .",
    "it has also been considered the case in which the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition in is replaced by the homogeneous neumann condition : @xmath38 these settings describe the evolution of temperature in an _ insulated _ conductor of given constant initial temperature and has been made popular by a conjecture of j. rauch @xcite that would imply that the hot spot must tend to a boundary point . even if we now know that it is false for a general domain , the conjecture holds true for certain planar convex domains but it is still standing for unrestrained convex domains .    the remainder of the paper is divided into three sections that reflect the aforementioned features . in section",
    "[ sec : harmonic ] , we shall describe the local properties of critical points of harmonic functions or , more generally , of solutions of elliptic equations , that lead to estimates of the size of critical sets . in section [ sec : number ] , we shall focus on bounds for the number of critical points that depend on the boundary behavior of the relevant solutions and/or the geometry of @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : location ] , we shall address the problem of locating the possible critical points . as customary for a survey ,",
    "our presentation will stress ideas rather than proofs .",
    "this paper is dedicated with sincere gratitude to giovanni alessandrini  an inspiring mentor , a supportive colleague and a genuine friend  on the occasion of his @xmath39 birthday .",
    "much of the material presented here was either inspired by his ideas or actually carried out in his research with the author .",
    "a harmonic function in a domain @xmath0 is a solution of the laplace s equation @xmath40 it is well known that harmonic functions are analytic , so there is no difficulty to define their critical points or the _ critical set _ @xmath41 before getting into the heart of the matter , we present a relevant example .      in dimension two , we have a powerful tool since we know that a harmonic function is ( locally ) the real or imaginary part of a holomorphic function .",
    "this remark provides our imagination with a reach set of examples on which we can speculate .",
    "for instance , the harmonic function @xmath42 , \\",
    "n\\in{\\mathbb{n}},\\ ] ] already gives some insight on the properties of harmonic functions we are interested in .",
    "in fact , we have that @xmath43 thus , @xmath4 has only one distinct critical point , @xmath44 , but it is more convenient to say that @xmath4 has @xmath45 critical points at @xmath44 or that @xmath44 is a critical point with _ multiplicity _ @xmath46 with @xmath47 . by virtue of this choice , we can give a topological meaning to @xmath46 .",
    "to see that , it is advantageous to represent @xmath4 in polar coordinates : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the principal branch of @xmath51 , that is we are assuming that @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the topological meaning of @xmath46 is manifest when we look at the level `` curve '' @xmath53 : it is made of @xmath54 straight lines passing through the critical point @xmath44 , divides the plane into @xmath55 _ cones _ ( angles ) , each of amplitude @xmath56 and the sign of @xmath4 changes across those lines ( see fig .",
    "one can also show that the signed angle @xmath57 formed by @xmath5 and the direction of the positive real semi - axis , since it equals @xmath58 , increases by @xmath59 while @xmath60 makes a complete loop clockwise around @xmath44 ; thus , @xmath46 is a sort of _ winding number _ for @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig : power ]   at the critical point @xmath44 ; @xmath4 changes sign from positive to negative at dashed lines and from negative to positive at solid lines.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the critical set of a homogeneous polynomial @xmath61 is a cone in @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath62 is also harmonic ( and non - constant ) one can show that @xmath63      if @xmath64 and @xmath4 is any harmonic function , the picture is similar to that outlined in the example .",
    "in fact , we can again consider the `` complex gradient '' of @xmath4 , @xmath65 and observe that @xmath66 is _ holomorphic _ in @xmath0 , since @xmath67 , and hence analytic .",
    "thus , the zeroes of @xmath66 ( and hence the critical points of @xmath4 ) in @xmath0 are _ isolated _ and have _",
    "finite multiplicity_. if @xmath68 is a zero with multiplicity @xmath46 of @xmath66 , then we can write that @xmath69 where @xmath20 is holomorphic in @xmath0 and @xmath70 .",
    "on the other hand , we also know that @xmath4 is locally the real part of a holomorphic function @xmath71 and hence , since @xmath72 , by an obvious normalization , it is not difficult to infer that @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is holomorphic and @xmath76 .",
    "passing to polar coordinates by @xmath77 tells us that @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we have that @xmath80 and hence , modulo a rotation by the angle @xmath81 , in a small neighborhood of @xmath68 , we can say that the critical level curve @xmath82 is very similar to that described in the example with @xmath83 replaced by @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , it is made of @xmath84 simple curves passing through @xmath68 and any two adjacent curves meet at @xmath68 with an angle that equals @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : harmonic ] .",
    "the curves meet with equal angles at the critical point.,title=\"fig : \" ]    if @xmath33 , similarly , a harmonic function can be approximated near a zero  @xmath83 by a homogeneous harmonic polynomial of some degree @xmath84 : @xmath85 however , the structure of the set @xmath86 depends on whether @xmath83 is an isolated critical point of @xmath87 or not .",
    "in fact , if @xmath83 is not isolated , then @xmath86 and @xmath88 could not be diffeomorphic in general , as shown by the harmonic function @xmath89 indeed , if @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the @xmath60-axis , while @xmath86 is made of @xmath92 isolated points ( @xcite ) .",
    "these arguments can be repeated with some necessary modifications for solutions of uniformly elliptic equations of the type , where the variable coefficients @xmath93 are lipschitz continuous and @xmath94 are bounded measurable on @xmath0 and the uniform ellipticity is assumed to take the following form : @xmath95    now , the classical theory of _ quasi - conformal _ mappings comes in our aid ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) . by the _ uniformization theorem _ ( see @xcite ) , there exists a quasi - conformal mapping @xmath96 , satisfying the equation @xmath97 such that the function @xmath98 defined by @xmath99 satisfies the equation @xmath100 where @xmath62 and @xmath101 are real - valued functions depending on the coefficients in and are essentially bounded on @xmath102 . notice that , since the composition of @xmath103 with a conformal mapping is still quasi - conformal , if it is convenient , by the riemann mapping theorem , we can choose @xmath102 to be the unit disk @xmath104 .    by setting @xmath105 ,",
    "simple computations give that @xmath106 where @xmath107 is essentially bounded .",
    "this equation tells us that @xmath108 is a _ pseudo - analytic _ function for which the following _ similarity principle _ holds ( see @xcite ) : there exist two functions , @xmath109 holomorphic in @xmath104 and @xmath110 hlder continuous on the whole @xmath111 , such that @xmath112    owing to , it is clear that the critical points of @xmath4 , by means of the mapping @xmath113 , correspond to the zeroes of @xmath114 or , which is the same , of @xmath109 and hence we can claim that they are isolated and have a finite multiplicity .",
    "this analysis can be further extended if the coefficients @xmath115 and @xmath116 are zero , that is for the solutions of . in this case",
    ", we can even assume that the coefficients @xmath93 be merely essentially bounded on @xmath0 , provided that we agree that @xmath4 is a non - constant _ weak _ solution of .",
    "it is well known that , with these assumptions , solutions of are in general only hlder continuous and the usual definition of critical point is no longer possible .",
    "however , in @xcite we got around this difficulty by introducing a different notion of critical point , that is still consistent with the topological structure of the level curves of @xmath4 at its critical values .    to see this , we look for a surrogate of the harmonic conjugate for @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , implies that the @xmath117-form @xmath118 is closed ( in the weak sense ) in @xmath0 and hence , thanks to the theory developed in @xcite , we can find a so - called _ stream function _ @xmath119 whose differential @xmath120 equals @xmath57 , in analogy with the theory of gas dynamics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in analogy with what we have done in subsection [ sub : harmonic ] , we find out that the function @xmath121 satisfies the equation @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 is a lower bound for the smaller eigenvalue of the matrix of the coefficients : @xmath125 the fact that @xmath126 implies that @xmath71 is a _ quasi - regular _ mapping that can be factored as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a _ quasi - conformal homeomorphism _ and @xmath129 is holomorphic in @xmath104 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the following _ representation formula _ holds : @xmath130 where @xmath98 is the real part of @xmath129 .",
    "[ fig : elliptic ] . at that point ,",
    "any two consecutive curves meet with positive angles , possibly not equal to one another.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this formula informs us that the level curves of @xmath4 can possibly be distorted by the homeomorphism @xmath131 , but preserve the topological structure of a harmonic function ( see fig .",
    "this remark gives grounds to the definition introduced in @xcite : @xmath132 is a _ geometric critical point _ of @xmath4 if the gradient of @xmath98 vanishes at @xmath133 .",
    "in particular , geometric critical points are isolated and can be classified by a sort of multiplicity .",
    "a similar local analysis can be replicated when @xmath64 for quasilinear equations of type @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 for every @xmath137 and some constants @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "[ fig : degenerate ]   at a critical value.,title=\"fig : \" ]    these equations can be even degenerate , such as the @xmath140-laplace equation with @xmath141 ( see @xcite ) . it is worth mentioning that also the case in which @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is increasing , with @xmath144 , and superlinear and growing polynomially at infinity ( e.g. @xmath145 ) , has been studied in  @xcite . in this case",
    "the function @xmath146 vanishes at @xmath147 and it turns out that the critical points of a solution @xmath4 ( if any ) are _ never _ isolated ( fig .",
    "2.4 ) .",
    "as already observed , critical points of harmonic functions in dimension @xmath33 may not be isolated . besides the example given in section [ sub : harmonic ] , another concrete example is given by the function @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the first bessel function : the gradient of @xmath4 vanishes at the origin and on the circles on the plane @xmath44 having radii equal to the zeroes of the second bessel function @xmath151 .",
    "it is clear that a region @xmath0 can be found such that @xmath152 is a _ bounded continuum_.    nevertheless , it can be proved that @xmath86 always has locally finite @xmath16-dimensional hausdorff measure @xmath153 . a nice argument to see this was suggested to me by d. peralta - salas @xcite . if @xmath4 is a non - constant harmonic function and",
    "we suppose that @xmath86 has dimension @xmath154 , then the general theory of analytic sets implies that there is an open and dense subset of @xmath86 which is an analytic sub - manifold ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath4 is constant on a connected component of the critical set , it is constant on @xmath86 , and its gradient vanishes .",
    "thus , by the cauchy - kowalewski theorem @xmath4 must be constant in a neighborhood of @xmath86 , and hence everywhere by unique continuation .",
    "of course , this argument would also work for solutions of an elliptic equation of type @xmath155 with analytic coefficients .",
    "when the coefficients @xmath156 in are of class @xmath157 , the result has been proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : if @xmath4 is a non - constant solution of , then for any compact subset @xmath158 of @xmath0 it holds that @xmath159 the proof is based on an estimate similar to for the complex dimension of the singular set in @xmath160 of the complexification of the polynomial @xmath87 in the approximation .",
    "the same result does not hold for solutions of equation @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
