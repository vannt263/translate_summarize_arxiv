    "optical wireless communication , where information is conveyed through optical radiations in free space in outdoor and indoor environments , is emerging as a promising complementary technology to rf wireless communication . while communication using infrared wavelengths has been in existence for quite some time @xcite,@xcite , more recent interest centers around indoor communication using visible light wavelengths @xcite,@xcite . a major attraction in indoor visible light communication ( vlc )",
    "is the potential to simultaneously provide both energy - efficient lighting as well as high - speed short - range communication using inexpensive high - luminance light - emitting diodes ( led ) .",
    "several other advantages including no rf radiation hazard , abundant vlc spectrum at no cost , and very high data rates make vlc increasingly popular .",
    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) which is popular in both wired and wireless rf communications is attractive in vlc as well @xcite .",
    "when ofdm is used in rf wireless communications , baseband ofdm signals in the complex domain are used to modulate the rf carrier .",
    "ofdm can be applied to vlc in context of intensity modulation and direct detection ( im / dd ) , where im / dd is non - coherent and the transmit signal must be real and positive .",
    "this can be achieved by imposing hermitian symmetry on the information symbols before the inverse fast fourier transform ( ifft ) operation .",
    "several papers have investigated ofdm in vlc @xcite-@xcite , which have shown that ofdm is attractive in vlc systems .",
    "a 3 gbps single - led vlc link based on ofdm has been reported in @xcite .",
    "several techniques that generate vlc compatible ofdm signals in the positive real domain have been proposed in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these techniques include dc - biased optical ( dco ) ofdm @xcite , asymmetrically clipped optical ( aco ) ofdm @xcite-@xcite , flip ofdm @xcite,@xcite , and non - dc biased ( ndc ) ofdm @xcite . in the above works , dco ofdm , aco ofdm , and flip ofdm are studied for single - led systems .",
    "the ndc ofdm in @xcite uses two leds . in @xcite",
    ", it has been that ndc ofdm performs better compared with dco ofdm and aco ofdm that use two leds .",
    "use of multiple leds is a natural and attractive means to achieve increased spectral efficiencies in vlc .",
    "our study in this paper focuses on multiple led ofdm techniques to vlc .",
    "our new contribution is the proposal of a scheme which brings in the advantage of ` spatial indexing ' to ofdm schemes for vlc .",
    "in particular , we propose a _ ` indexed ndc ( i - ndc ) ofdm ' _ scheme , where information bits are not only conveyed through the modulation symbols sent on the active led , but also through the index of the active led .",
    "this brings in the benefit of higher rate and better performance .",
    "our simulation results show that , for the same spectral efficiency , the proposed i - ndc ofdm outperforms ndc ofdm in the low - to - moderate snr regime .",

    "however , in the high - snr regime , ndc ofdm performs better .",
    "we find that this is because of the high error rates witnessed by the index bits in i - ndc ofdm due to high channel correlation in multiple led settings . in order to alleviate this problem and improve the reliability of the index bits at the receiver",

    "here , we present an overview of the existing ofdm schemes for vlc reported in the literature .",
    "figure [ ofdmsys ] shows the block diagram of a general single - led ofdm system with @xmath0 subcarriers for vlc . in this system ,",
    "a real ofdm signal is generated by constraining the input vector to the transmit @xmath0-point ifft to have hermitian symmetry , so that the output of the ifft will be real .",
    "the output of the ifft , though real , can be positive or negative .",
    "it can be made positive by several methods , namely , 1 ) adding dc bias @xmath1dco ofdm @xcite@xmath2 , 2 ) clipping at zero and transmitting only positive part @xmath1aco ofdm @xcite-@xcite@xmath2 , and 3 ) transmitting both positive and negative parts after flipping the negative part @xmath1flip ofdm @xcite@xmath2 . while the block diagram in fig .",
    "[ ofdmsys ] is for ofdm for vlc in general , the transmit and receive processing and achieved rates in bits per channel use ( bpcu ) can differ in the ofdm schemes listed above .",
    "these are highlighted below .      in dco ofdm , @xmath3",
    "incoming data bits are mapped to @xmath4 qam symbols , where @xmath5 is the qam constellation size .",
    "the dc subcarrier ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) is set to zero .",
    "the @xmath4 qam symbols are mapped to subcarriers 1 to @xmath7 , i.e.,@xmath8 .",
    "hermitian symmetry is applied to the remaining @xmath9 subcarriers , i.e. , complex conjugates of the symbols on the first @xmath9 subcarriers are mapped on the second half subcarriers in the reverse order , where the @xmath10th subcarrier is set to zero .",
    "that is , the input to the @xmath0-point ifft is given by @xmath11^t.\\ ] ] this hermitian symmetry ensures that the ifft output will be real and bipolar .",
    "these bipolar ofdm symbols @xmath12 , at the ifft output are converted into unipolar by adding a dc bias , @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the bipolar ofdm signal without dc bias .",
    "then the unipolar ofdm signal @xmath15 that drives the transmit led is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we define this as a bias of @xmath18 db .",
    "note that @xmath19 corresponds to the case of no dc bias .",
    "for the dc bias to be not excessive , the negative going signal peaks must be clipped at zero .",
    "the performance of dco ofdm depends on the amount of dc bias , which depends upon the size of the signal constellation @xcite .",
    "for example , large qam constellations require high snrs for acceptable bers , and therefore the clipping noise must be kept low , which , in turn , requires the dc bias to be large . as the dc bias increases , the required transmit power also increases .",
    "this makes the system power inefficient .",
    "due to hermitian symmetry , the number of independent qam symbols transmitted per ofdm symbol is reduced from @xmath0 to @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the achieved rate in dco ofdm is @xmath21 at the receiver side , the output of the photo detector ( pd ) , @xmath22 , is digitized using an analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) and the resulting sequence , @xmath23 , is processed further .",

    "only @xmath25 in the fft output need to be demapped and demodulated to recover the transmit data .",
    "aco ofdm does not use dc bias to convert the bipolar ofdm signal to unipolar .",
    "instead , all negative values in the bipolar signal are clipped to zero .",
    "clipping is a simpler operation in terms of implementation compared to dc bias . but this can introduce clipping noise . the effect of clipping noise can be alleviated significantly by sending data symbols only on the odd subcarriers .",
    "more specifically , if only the odd subcarriers are used , the intermodulation product terms generated due to clipping fall on the even subcarriers , which are ignored . while this addresses the clipping noise issue , the achieved data rate is compromised by a factor of two compared to dco ofdm , i.e. , in an @xmath0-subcarrier aco ofdm scheme , only @xmath26 subcarriers are used for data transmission , whereas dco ofdm uses @xmath20 subcarriers for data transmission .    in aco ofdm , @xmath27 incoming bits are mapped to @xmath26 @xmath5-qam symbols .",
    "these symbols are mapped on the first @xmath26 odd subcarriers .",
    "the even subcarriers are set to zero . to ensure hermitian symmetry ,",

    "_ ldpc coding for index bits : _ we propose to use a rate-@xmath111 ldpc code to encode @xmath140 uncoded index bits and obtain @xmath69 coded index bits , @xmath141 . at the transmitter , @xmath142 uncoded index bits are accumulated to obtain @xmath143 ldpc coded index bits .",
    "now , the @xmath143 coded index bits are used to select the index of the active led block .",
    "thus , one ldpc codeword of size @xmath143 is transmitted in @xmath144 channel uses . therefore , the overall spectral efficiency achieved by the ci - ndc scheme is @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the size of the qam alphabet used in ci - ndc ofdm .",
    "the proposed ci - ndc ofdm transmitter and receiver are shown in figs .",

    "[ figx2 ] , we compare the performance of the proposed c - indc ofdm with that of ndc ofdm .",
    "we match the spectral efficiencies of both the schemes by using the following configurations : @xmath132 ) ndc ofdm : @xmath147 , @xmath133 , @xmath61 , @xmath129 , @xmath148 bpcu , and @xmath134 ) c - indc ofdm : @xmath147 , @xmath149 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 bpcu . from fig .",
    "[ figx2 ] , we observe that , for the same spectral efficiency of about 3.8 bpcu , the proposed ci - ndc ofdm performs better than ndc ofdm .",
    "for example , to achieve a ber of @xmath154 , ci - ndc ofdm requires about 1.3 db less snr compared to ndc ofdm .",
    "this is because of the improved reliability of the index bits achieved through coding of index bits .",
    "we proposed an efficient multiple led ofdm scheme , termed as coded index non - dc - biased ofdm , for vlc .",
    "the proposed scheme was motivated by the high spectral efficiency and performance benefits of using multiple leds and spatial indexing . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "additional information bits were conveyed through indexing in addition to qam bits . the channel correlation in multiple led settings was found to significantly degrade the reliability of index bits recovery . to overcome this , we proposed coding of index bits .",
    "this was found to serve the intended purpose of achieving better performance compared to other ofdm schemes for vlc .",
