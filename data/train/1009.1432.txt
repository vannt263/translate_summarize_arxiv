    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous explosions in the universe .",
    "their basic scenario based on the emission from extremely relativistic outflows with bulk lorentz factors @xmath7 and isotropic energies of @xmath8 has been tested , although many questions remain open .",
    "the fermi satellite has advanced our knowledge of grbs significantly , while raising some new puzzles . during its first @xmath9 of operation as of july 27th , 2010 ,",
    "fermi has observed 19 grbs with photons detected in the lat ( large area telescope ) instrument .",
    "these observations reveal three new properties",
    "@xcite : i ) a delayed high energy emission , e.g. , in grb 080916c , grb 081024b , grb 090510 , grb 090902b and grb 090926a photons arrive later than the first lower energy photons detected by gbm ( gamma - ray burst monitor ) . ] .",
    "ii ) a temporally extended high energy emission : at least 10 of the first 19 fermi lat grbs have long - lived high energy emission , lasting much longer than the burst duration in the sub - mev band ( which declines very rapidly ) ; in 4 out of 10 grbs , the long - lived lat light curves have a relatively steeper slope , for example , @xmath10 for grb 080916c , @xmath11 for grb 090510 , @xmath12 for grb 090902b , @xmath13 for grb 090926a according to @xcite .",
    "iii ) a deviation from a pure band spectral function , showing an extra component in grb 090510 , grb 090902b , grb 090926a . these are among the brightest bursts , but the observations are compatible with the hypothesis of having such a component also in the other , less bright bursts , where it is harder to detect @xcite .    among these 19 fermi",
    "lat grbs , grb 090510 is a short , hard burst , with a duration @xmath14@xcite , located at a redshift @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it has been detected by fermi @xcite , agile @xcite , swift @xcite , konus - wind @xcite and suzaku @xcite .",
    "thus , a large amount of high - quality broadband information is available on this burst , including optical , x - ray , mev and gev emission .",
    "the swift bat instrument triggered on grb 090510 at @xmath16 ut , may 10th , 2009 @xcite , while the gbm instrument onboard fermi triggered on at @xmath17 ut , may 10th , 2009 @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a deviation between the two trigger times , which is @xmath18 .",
    "hereafter we adopt the bat trigger time @xmath19 as a natural start time @xmath20 for computing the afterglow evolution , this being the onset of the main burst .",
    "the high energy emission of grb 090510 has all three of the new features we summarized above : i ) the bulk of the photons above 30 mev arrive @xmath21 later than those below @xmath22 @xcite ; ii ) the high energy emission above @xmath23 shows a simple power law decay lasting @xmath24 with a temporal decay index @xmath25 @xcite;. ] iii ) the time - integrated spectrum from @xmath26 to @xmath27 is best fit by a band function and a power - law spectrum @xcite ; the extra power - law component photon index of @xmath28 can fit the data well up to the highest - energy ( @xmath29 ) photon @xcite .    the xrt observations alone give a spectral index @xmath30 @xcite , while a detailed analysis of the temporal xrt emission combined with the lat emission indicates a spectral index @xmath31 ranging from @xmath32 to @xmath33@xcite , and a temporal decay index @xmath34 before a break time @xmath35 , which subsequently steepens to @xmath36 .",
    "the optical emission initially rises with a temporal index @xmath37 , and after a break time @xmath38 it decays with a temporal index @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "most of the models aimed at explaining the long - lived high energy emission of grb 090510 have favored the view that the high energy photons arise from the afterglow emission , being generated via synchrotron emission in the external forward shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this explanation is fairly natural , since an external forward shock model can account for , at least in its gross features , not only for the observed delay of the @xmath40 photons , which corresponds to the deceleration time - scale of the relativistic ejecta , but also for the long lasting @xmath41 emission , which can be attributed to the power - law decay of the synchrotron external forward shock emission @xcite .",
    "however , various of the above cited authors use somewhat different readings of the publicly available spectral and temporal slope data , which lead them to favor different explanations for the rapid decay of the long - lived high energy emission , falling into five different classes of models as follows .",
    "one set of models interprets the lat emission as synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in a standard adiabatic ism forward shock @xcite .",
    "these authors argue that they can explain the lat , x - ray , and optical data with plausible parameter values ( and we revisit these arguments below ) .",
    "however , these authors did not perform a complete enough study to confirm whether the whole lat data including the first @xmath42 second can be explained by this type of models .",
    "@xcite fit the late lat data as @xmath43 , but do not give much significance to the early - time lat data .",
    "@xcite fit the whole lat data as @xmath44 , which seems to explain the early - time lat data but exceeds the @xmath45 upper limits at late times ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest a steeper decay slope of the high energy emission ( evolving as @xmath47 ) for the whole lat data by taking a larger electron distribution index @xmath48 , but they do nt take into account in sufficient depth the early - time lat data ( @xmath49 ) , which is necessary in order to conclude what is the origin of the entire lat emission ( see more discussion in section 6 ) .",
    "other models , e.g. , @xcite attribute the high - energy photons to synchrotron - self - compton scattering ( ssc ) from an adiabatic forward shock propagating into a wind - like medium ; this , however , requires an extremely small magnetic energy fraction @xmath50 .",
    "another , different adiabatic forward shock model analyses in greater detail the klein - nishina ( kn ) effects on the high energy inverse compton process @xcite . for some reasonable parameters , the kn effect ,",
    "as it weakens in time , results in the synchrotron high energy emission being increasingly suppressed by the ssc cooling , which steepens the synchrotron high energy emission decay slope by a factor as large as @xmath51 .",
    "a fourth model views the high - energy emission as decaying proportional to @xmath52 , which is interpreted as being caused by synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in a forward shock in the radiative , rather then adiabatic , regime . for this",
    ", the electron population must be significantly enriched , which is attributed to pair production between back - scattering photons and prompt outward - going photons @xcite .",
    "this model explains the high energy emission without considering the constraints from lower energy , e.g. , gbm band , xrt band and uvot band emission , and the pair formation becomes inefficient at shock radii larger than @xmath53 , while @xmath54 for this burst ( see  4 ) .",
    "a fifth type of model for the afterglow of this burst ( and others ) is a hadronic model @xcite , which explains the high energy emission as proton synchrotron emission , while attributing the low energy emission to electron synchrotron emission from a forward external shock .",
    "this requires a large total kinetic energy @xmath55 , with a low radiation efficiency and an extremely small fraction of electron energy @xmath56 .    in this article , we re -",
    "examine the first set of models ( the standard adiabatic forward shock model ) in significantly greater detail than hitherto .",
    "we present detailed arguments indicating that it is most likely that the forward shock synchrotron emission can only explain the lat emission from @xmath57 sec .",
    "this conclusion disfavors the external shock origin of the early - time lat emission @xcite , but supports the suggestions that it is related to the prompt emission @xcite . in @xmath58 2",
    ", we examine the xrt and uvot observations , and set up a model of the long - lived emission based on synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated in a forward shock in a uniform ambient environment , including these x - ray and optical / uv observations .",
    "we discuss the impact of the klein - nishina effects on the high energy emission , under the constraints imposed by the lower energy observations , which are found to be significant for suppressing the ssc cooling . in @xmath59",
    "we use a semi - analytical model to calculate the development of the dynamical quantities of the forward shock across the deceleration time and into the self - similar phase , and use this to calculate the radiation properties of the long - lived high energy emission produced by synchrotron emission .",
    "we find a reasonable set of parameters which can explain most of the late afterglow , except for the six earliest lat data points in the light curve .",
    "in @xmath60 we check several possibilities for the origin of this early high energy emission at times @xmath61 . in @xmath62",
    "we discuss the possibility of the line - of - sight prompt emission as the origin of the early - time high - energy emission .",
    "in @xmath63 we discuss our conclusions concerning the most probable origin of the high energy emission from the short grb 090510 .",
    "the afterglow emission of grb is generally well explained by synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by the shock produced during a spherical relativistic shell colliding with an external medium . from the spectral index @xmath64 and the light curve slope @xmath65 @xcite , the closure relation for the x - ray afterglow @xmath66 ranges from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , suggesting a slow - cooling ism external forward shock model with @xmath69 , and @xmath70 to represent the quantities of the forward - shocked and reverse - shocked regions , respectively , and we use the convention @xmath71 in cgs units throughout the paper . ] which implies that the decay index of the x - ray light curve before the jet break is @xmath72 and the x - ray spectral index is @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "indicates the slow / fast - cooling ism / wind external forward shock model with @xmath74 and the spectral index @xmath75 , but this implies @xmath76 , which is not favored by numerical simulations of shock acceleration ( e.g. , @xcite ) or by observational data of general grb afterglows @xcite . ] from the spectral index we can get a constraint on @xmath77 which is @xmath78 . in the external shock model ,",
    "the break seen in x - ray light curve can be explained as a jet break .",
    "we assume that the jet expands sideways ( sari et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this case",
    "the x - ray light curve slope steepens gradually from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , so that we have @xmath81 , which is reduced to @xmath82 by taking @xmath83 . combining the above two constraints we have @xmath84 .",
    "then the x - ray decay slope before the break should be @xmath85 , which can be acceptable if we take into account the observed fluctuation of the x - ray flux , as the light curves we will show below .    for the rising portion of the optical light curve before the break time , it is natural to assume that the optical band is below @xmath86 , which induces an optical light curve slope of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the predicted spectral slope @xmath88 is consistent with the observations within the large error bars @xcite .",
    "thus , one can try to explain both the x - ray emission and the optical emission before the break time with synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in an adiabatic external forward shock with the assumptions @xmath89 and @xmath69 . then , assuming that the optical band is in the regime of @xmath90 after the break time , the slope of the optical post - break light curve is the same as that of the x - ray light curve .    in the analytical calculations of this section , we assume that the self - similar phase conditions have been established , and for simplicity we neglect the structure of the shock wave , considering a spherical shock with a total isotropic energy @xmath91 and a lorentz factor @xmath92 . at late times , the adiabatic dynamical evolution of the spherical shock is in the blandford @xmath93 mckee self - similar phase , where @xmath94 is constant and the scaling law of the shock wave is @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the shock propagates a distance @xmath96 during the small observing time @xmath97 @xcite , and integrating this and using the scaling law , one obtains @xmath98 .    according to @xcite , the cooling and minimum lorentz factors of the electrons in the forward",

    "the peak flux density of the forward shock synchrotron emission is @xmath111 where the total number of the electrons that the forward shock swept up is @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is the luminosity distance .",
    "we get two constraints from the uvot and xrt data as follows : + ( i ) the optical flux density is about @xmath114 at @xmath115 @xcite , which indicates that @xmath116 ( ii ) the x - ray flux density is about @xmath114 at @xmath117 , which indicates @xmath118 combining the above two equations ( [ fopt ] ) and ( [ fxrt ] ) , we can express the fraction of the magnetic field energy and the number density as @xmath119 @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 and we can naturally get @xmath123 from the condition @xmath124 .    inserting equations ( [ ebcon ] ) and ( [ ncon ] ) into equation ( [ b ] ) , the downstream magnetic field strength is thus constrained to be @xmath125",

    "however , as we discuss in  [ sec : disc ] , the external density deduced here is much below the average interstellar value , and likely so would be the external magnetic field , so that additional field amplification may be needed .",
    "inserting equations ( [ ebcon ] ) and ( [ ncon ] ) into equations ( [ hnuc ] ) , ( [ hnumin ] ) and ( [ fmax ] ) , the characteristic energies and the peak flux density of synchrotron emission are therefore @xmath129^{-2}g_p^2g_{e2}^{-10}{\\rm ev},\\ ] ] @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively .",
    "the above equations show that @xmath89 until @xmath132 , and @xmath133 under the constraint @xmath134 , which is easy to satisfy , where @xmath135 as discussed in  [ sec;kn ] .",
    "thus , they are consistent with our previous assumptions .",
    "the radiative efficiency in the assumed slow cooling regime is @xcite @xmath136 which is much less than unity , consistent with our previous assumption of an adiabatic forward shock model .    in order to check whether the lat emission predicted by synchrotron emission from an adiabatic forward shock can explain the lat observations we need to study two situations .",
    "\\(i ) under the condition @xmath137 , we yield @xmath138 at @xmath139 , the average synchrotron flux density from the forward shock in the lat band ( @xmath140 to @xmath141 ) is @xmath142 which is independent of the electron energy @xmath143 . in addition , the slope of the lat light curve is also constrained , as @xmath144 , the same as that of the x - ray light curve . for @xmath48 , @xmath145 at @xmath139 is satisfied if @xmath146 , then the predicted lat flux is @xmath147 at @xmath148 s , consistent with the observational data within the error bars at around @xmath148 s. the corresponding slope of the predicted lat light curve is around @xmath149 , which can explain the late - time data of the lat observation .",
    "if we take a small electron index , for example , @xmath150 , we have @xmath138 at @xmath151 if @xmath152 .",
    "then the predicted lat flux can be calculated by equation ( [ flat ] ) , approximated as @xmath153 at @xmath148 s , which is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the observed lat flux .",
    "what s more , the slope of the predicted lat light curve is about @xmath154 , which is too shallow to explain the late - time lat observation .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath138 at @xmath148 s , we can exclude the @xmath155 model .",
    "\\(ii ) if the electron energy satisfies the condition @xmath156 , the lower end of the lat band , @xmath148 mev , is above the frequency @xmath157 , and the predicted lat flux at @xmath151 can be calculated as @xmath158 inserting the condition @xmath159 into equation ( [ flatsteeper ] ) , we see that @xmath160 . for @xmath48 , the predicted lat flux at @xmath148 s",

    "here we adopt fairly standard values of @xmath164 , similar to those observed in long grbs , since these are determined by collisionless shock physics processes on microphysical scales , which should be independent of the global properties of grbs .",
    "then the constrained total kinetic energy could be @xmath165 . since the isotropic energy at @xmath166 energy band during @xmath167 is @xmath168 @xcite , the radiative efficiency of the prompt emission is in the range @xmath169 .",
    "moreover , we constrain @xmath170 and @xmath171 by inserting the constraint @xmath163 into equations ( [ ebcon ] ) and ( [ ncon ] ) .",

    "since the expected slope of the lat light curve is @xmath177 for @xmath155 in the @xmath178 case , similar to that expected from the @xmath48 model in the @xmath179 case , this can also explain the slope of the late - time lat light curve .",
    "even though @xmath86 decreases by a factor of @xmath180 by taking @xmath155 rather than taking @xmath48 , it does nt change the optical break time by much , and we may not rule out the @xmath155 model in the @xmath162 case .",
    "thus , both the @xmath48 model in the @xmath138 case and the @xmath155 model in the @xmath162 case can explain the late - time lat light curve , leading to the same conclusion , since the predicted lat light curves have the similar slope . for presentation purposes , hereafter , we discuss the @xmath48 model in the @xmath138 case .",
    "@xcite have studied the klein - nishina ( kn ) effects on high - energy gamma - ray emission in the early afterglow , and find that at early times the kn suppression on the ic scattering cross section for the electrons that produce the high - energy emission is usually strong , and therefore their inverse - compton losses are small , with a compton parameter @xmath181 of less than a few for a wide range of parameter space .",
    "this leads to a relatively bright synchrotron afterglow emission at high energies at early times .",
    "however , as the kn effects weaken with time , the inverse - compton losses increase and the synchrotron high energy emission is increasingly suppressed , which leads to a more rapid decaying synchrotron emission .",
    "this provides a potential mechanism for the steep decay of the high - energy gamma - ray emission seen in some fermi lat grbs .",
    "the compton parameter for electrons with lorentz factor @xmath182 is defined as the ratio of the synchrotron self - inverse compton ( ssc ) to the synchrotron emissivity , i.e. @xmath183 when the kn suppression on the scattering cross section is negligible , @xmath184 is a constant for the slow - cooling case @xcite .",
    "however , for high energy electrons with a significant kn effect , @xmath185 is no longer a constant and this affects the electron radiative cooling function , as well as the continuity equation of the electron distribution .",
    "the self - consistent electron distribution is given by @xmath186 for the slow - cooling case @xcite , where @xmath187 is a constant .",
    "the high energy synchrotron photons with energy @xmath188 are produced by electrons with lorentz factor @xmath189 which typically have @xmath190 .",

    "therefore , the number density of electrons with lorentz factor @xmath189 is a factor of @xmath193 lower than that in the case where only the synchrotron cooling is considered .",
    "thus the synchrotron luminosity is correspondingly reduced by the same factor .",
    "we have @xmath194 , in the slow cooling regime , as long as @xmath195 @xcite . in that case , if @xmath196 the synchrotron luminosity is suppressed by the factor @xmath197 which is in proportion to @xmath87 , i.e. the light curve decay of the high energy synchrotron emission could be steepened by a factor @xmath198 at most .",

    "these appear to explain well the late time lat emission , i.e. after 3 seconds , either with the larger or smaller angle / lorentz factor , no matter how small the deceleration time is , but they fall below the first six lat data points .",
    "this difference between the early time observed lat data and the synchrotron forward shock emission suggests that there may be another radiation component ( whose contribution can be represented by the gray dotted lines in figures 1 and 2 , corresponding to the high latitude emission of the prompt emission with variability timescale @xmath248 ) , in addition to the forward synchrotron contribution ( shown as the black solid lines ) , at least for its decaying portion .",
    "the gray solid lines are the sum of the steep decay component and the forward synchrotron emission with a larger lorentz factor ( the first , lower data point could be part of either a rising portion or a variable portion of the gray dotted component ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the early - time high - energy emission is not from the afterglow forward shock synchrotron emission , instead having a different origin . in the next section",
    "we discuss possible origins for the first six data points in the lat band around the deceleration time .",
    "besides the forward shock synchrotron emission , around the deceleration time there are several other possible emission components which could contribute to the early lat observations .",
    "their importance can be estimated using approximate values for the characteristic quantities at the deceleration time . at the deceleration time , the blandford - mckee self - similar solution is not yet applicable .",
    "for this we can take the usual value of the energy as @xmath249 and @xmath250 as the radius at the deceleration time @xcite , from which we obtain the initial lorentz factor of the shock and the deceleration radius , which are @xmath251 @xmath252    before we examine the other possible components around the deceleration time , we confirm that the forward shock synchrotron emission can not explain the observation at early times in more details .",
    "we can then estimate the approximate high energy emission at the deceleration time under the previous constraints provided by the low energy observations . here",
    "we take the lorentz factor and radius at the deceleration time as @xmath253 and @xmath254 , which are close to the values indicated by the numerical evolution of the previous section . inserting the above @xmath255 and @xmath256 into the first expressions of equations ( [ gammac ] ) @xmath257 ( [ fmax ] ) , and meanwhile adopting equations ( [ ebcon ] ) and ( [ ncon ] ) , the characteristic frequencies and peak flux density of the forward shock synchrotron emission at the deceleration time are then @xmath258 @xmath259 @xmath260    @xcite suggests the radiative forward shock model to explain the steep temporal decay of high energy emission , which requires @xmath261 to get the fast cooling case .",
    "however , the radiative model can not explain the shallower decay at later time ( @xmath262 ) ( as seen in figure 7 in @xcite ) , which agrees better with an adiabatic model in slow cooling case at that time . according to the constrained characteristic frequencies , the fast cooling case at the deceleration time requires that @xmath263 which is inconsistent with their assumption of a very high energy fraction of electrons @xmath264 .",
    "this is because @xcite assume the late - time emission to be also in the fast cooling case , and do not take into account the constraints from the low energy emission .",
    "in addition , using equations ( [ ebcon ] ) and ( [ ncon ] ) , we get an estimate for the forward shock synchrotron emission at @xmath265 at the deceleration time , @xmath266 this is almost one order of magnititude below the observed lat flux density , for the case when the deceleration time is smaller than @xmath267 ( this is seen also in figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the synchrotron forward shock emission can not explain the early - time high - energy emission ( the first six lat data points near the deceleration time ) , although it can explain very well the late lat results ( beyond the sixth lat data point , when the afterglow can be considered as established ) , which are consistent with the numerical results in  [ sec : fssyn ] .    thus , we find that there has to be another component , contributing to the early high energy emission . in the rest of this section",
    "we consider several such possibilities , such as a reverse shock synchrotron component , a reverse shock ssc component or a cross ic component(forward / reverse shock synchrotron photons scattered by electrons from reverse - shocked / forward - shocked region ) , a high latitude ( curvature ) component of the prompt high energy emission .",
    "we consider the thin shell case as is assumed in  3 , the flux peaks at the crossing time of the reverse shock @xmath268 with lorentz factor @xmath269 , and the ratio of the comoving number densities of the forward - shocked to that of the reverse - shocked regions is given by @xmath270 @xcite .",
    "the internal energy densities @xmath271 and the bulk lorentz factors @xmath92 of the two regions are equal with each other @xcite .",
    "consequently , we have that @xmath272^{-2 } ,   ~~\\frac{f_{\\rm max}^{\\rm r}}{f_{\\rm max}^{\\rm f}}=\\frac{n_{\\rm r}}{n_{\\rm f}}\\re_b,\\ ] ] characterized by the ratios @xmath273 , @xmath274 .",
    "the minimum and cooling frequencies of the reverse shock synchrotron emission at the crossing time under the low energy constraints are @xmath275 @xmath276^{-2 } { \\rm ev}.\\ ] ]    according to  2.2 , we have @xmath277 around the deceleration time , thus the synchrotron spectrum does not change and the ratio of the reverse shock synchrotron flux to forward shock synchrotron flux can be calculated as @xmath278 inserting equations ( [ ebcon ] ) and ( [ ncon ] ) into equation ( [ fratio ] ) , the ratio turns to be @xmath279 the ratio could be as high as @xmath280 since the total kinetic energy can be as high as @xmath281 by considering a reasonable radiation efficiency @xmath282 . considering equation ( [ f_f ] ) , the flux density from reverse shock synchrotron emission can not be as high as @xmath283 to explain the observations at early times .",
    "thus , the reverse shock synchrotron emission is unlikely to contribute to the early - time lat observation .      besides the reverse synchrotron emission , we consider the other four possible ic processes , including the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) processes in forward and reverse shocks , and two combined - ic processes ( i.e. scattering of reverse - shock synchrotron photons on electrons accelerated in forward shocks and froward - shock synchrotron photons on electrons accelerated in reverse shocks ) .",
    "the optical depth of inverse compton scattering in the reverse shock in the thomson regime is @xmath284@xcite .",
    "the optical depth to inverse compton scattering in the forward shock in the thomson regime is @xmath285 .",
    "taking the peak flux of synchrotron emission at the crossing time of the reverse shock and forward shock , which are @xmath286 and @xmath287 , respectively , we can get the peak flux density of the four inverse - compton components as follows @xcite , @xmath288 @xmath289 @xmath290 and @xmath291 respectively , where the superscripts ` rr ' and ` ff ' mean the ssc emission in reverse shock and forward shock respectively , ` fr ' and ` rf ' mean the scattering of reverse shock photons on the electrons in forward shocks and forward shock photons on the electrons in reverse shocks .",
    "therefore , the ic contributions ( except for the ssc emission in the reverse shock ) can be excluded , since even their peak fluxes are much smaller than the early - time lat observations .",
    "although the peak flux of the ssc emission in the reverse shock is close to the observed flux , the reverse shock ssc emission can also be excluded because its flux peaks at a low energy of about @xmath292 , indicating that the flux in the lat band is about @xmath293 orders lower than the peak flux .",
    "a low flux for these ic processes is mainly due to a very low circum - burst density in grb 090510 inferred from the low - energy observations .",
    "the spectrum of grb 090510 shows a power - law component in the lat band ( @xmath294 ) , whose physical origin at early times is unclear",
    ". one might consider the early part of the extended emission ( shown by the gray dotted line with a decay slope @xmath295 in figures 1 and 2 ) is due to the high - latitude emission of the prompt emission @xcite . because photons from high latitude regions with respect to the line of sight will arrive later than that from low latitude region due to the curved front surface of the jet",
    ", one observes a fast decreasing emission rather than an abrupt stop of the emission , the so - called  curvature effect \" .",
    "then the high latitude emission flux of the prompt emission evolves as @xmath296^{-2-\\beta}\\ ] ] according to @xcite(the details are shown in appendix b ) , where @xmath297 is the pulse peak time . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the variability timescale derived from the bgo emission ( @xmath298few mev ) is about @xmath299 in the time interval @xmath300 since the bat trigger , but the variability timescale for the lat emission is not determined .",
    "if we assume that the variability timescale for the high energy ( larger than @xmath140 ) emission , which is dominated by the power law component , is the same as that of bgo observation , then we adopt @xmath301 in equation ( [ cur ] ) .",
    "thus , the high latitude flux of the prompt emission at @xmath302 is @xmath303 . since the index of the power law component in the time interval @xmath300 is @xmath304 @xcite , we take the rough value @xmath305",
    ". then the flux of the high - latitude emission at @xmath306 will be reduced by a factor of @xmath307 relative to that of the line - of - sight emission at @xmath308 , which is too steep to explain the early high energy emission at @xmath309 .",
    "since the origin of the lat emission in the prompt phase , dominated by the extra power - law component , is unclear and can be different from that of the band component in the gbm energy range , the variability timescale in the lat range can generally be different from @xmath310 .",
    "in particular , the emission radius of the extra high energy component may be much larger than that of the band component , which may lead to a much larger pulse width in the lat energy range than in the gbm energy range ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if we take @xmath311 , then the high latitude flux of the prompt emission at @xmath312 evolves as @xmath313 , which together with the synchrotron forward shock emission with a deceleration time @xmath314 can explain the early high energy emission at @xmath315 , shown in fig 1 .",
    "as a final possibility , we consider the possible influence of the tail - end of the prompt emission in the description of the early afterglow . in  3 and  4",
    "we assumed a small grb duration @xmath316 , following @xcite based on the observations in the gbm and bat bands . under this assumption",
    ", we discussed the forward shock synchrotron emission , the forward reverse shock synchrotron emission , the four possible crossed inverse compton processes , and the high latitude emission of the prompt emission , and we concluded that none of them can explain the early decaying part of the high energy emission at @xmath317 except for the high latitude portion of the prompt emission with a larger variability time scale plus the synchrotron forward shock emission with a deceleration time @xmath314 .",
    "we focus on the bat detections around @xmath318 s , shown in @xcite , which implies that the prompt emission could last until such times .",
    "we calculate the flux of the synchrotron forward shock emission at @xmath319s for @xmath48 in the bat energy range , and obtain @xmath320 ( the flux is similar for @xmath155 ) .",
    "this is about one order of magnitude smaller than the observed flux .",
    "thus these bat detections are not from the external shock , but may be attributed to the prompt emission .",
    "the lat prompt emission may also last until such times .",
    "@xcite obtain no significant temporal correlation between nai ( @xmath321 ) data and the lat data @xmath294 between @xmath322 s and @xmath323 s. this does not necessarily indicate that the lat prompt emission ( the extra component ) and the gbm prompt emission ( band component ) have fully unrelated origins .",
    "some theoretical models suggest that the two components may arise at different radii ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) in the same shells , or the two components may arise by the leptonic and hadronic processes in the same internal shock ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it appears reasonable to consider that grb 090510 has a duration as long as @xmath324 s and the high energy emission before @xmath325 s is a part of the prompt emission .    under this new assumption , with a longer grb duration @xmath326 , one infers a critical lorentz factor @xmath327 . for the thin shell case with an initial lorentz factor @xmath328 smaller than @xmath329",

    "the high energy light curve with the initial lorentz factor @xmath243 and the number density @xmath330 is shown by the thin solid line in figure 2 , which can explain the late - time high energy emission well .",
    "if we assume that the lat emission around @xmath331 is a flare of duration @xmath332 , which peaks at @xmath333 with a peak flux @xmath334 , and having @xcite a spectral index @xmath335 at @xmath336 , then the flux due to curvature effect at @xmath337 is @xmath338 , which is compatible with the seventh data point . in this case , the deceleration time could in principle be even larger , implying a smaller lorentz factor , but due to the lack of precise information about the last flare , e.g. , its duration and the flux peak time , we can not use this to derive a firmer deceleration time .    for a larger initial lorentz factor @xmath339 , the reverse shock will transition from the newtonian phase to the relativistic phase at the time @xmath340 @xcite , with the width of the shell in the comoving frame @xmath341 .",
    "the deceleration time when the dissipated energy is comparable to the total kinetic energy of the shell is about @xmath342 . at the time @xmath343 , the lorentz factor of the forward",
    "shock evolves as @xmath344 , and the radius of the shell evolves as @xmath345 .",

    ", the flux of high energy emission in the region @xmath179 evolves as @xmath349 ; and the flux density of high energy emission in the region @xmath162 evolves as @xmath350 .",
    "this shows that the forward shock synchrotron emission in the thick shell case can not explain the early - time high energy emission due to its flatter light curve . and the reverse shock emission in the thick shell case can also be excluded , using similar calculations as in  4 .    based on the above analysis , while the forward shock synchrotron afterglow dominates the lat emission at late times , the early times lat emission must be attributed to a prompt emission , which can be limited from above by a high - latitude curvature emission envelope .",
    "we have investigated whether the photons received by the lat can be explained solely by the forward shock afterglow emission or whether the prompt emission necessarily contributes to the early part of this emission .",
    "we have addressed this question with the help of the broad - band observations from the xrt and uvot instruments onboard of swift and the lat onboard of fermi for the case of the short grb 090510 , obtaining constraints on the extended high - energy emission based on the xrt and uvot observations .",
    "we have obtained a good fit to the xrt and uvot observations ( except for the late - time optical data ) in terms of synchrotron emission from an adiabatic forward shock in spreading jet model , which constrains the environment of this short burst , implying a low number density @xmath351 , consistent with a binary progenitor scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to an electron energy fraction @xmath352 and a weak magnetic field with an energy fraction @xmath353 .",
    "the latter could in principle be due to an upstream magnetic field of @xmath354 g just shock - compressed , without need for magnetic field amplification @xcite .",

    "thus , the magnetic field may still need to be amplified in the shock .",
    "we note also that while the electron energy fraction can be as high as @xmath360 , the adiabatic condition is still satisfied , since the low energy emission constrains the radiation to be in the slow cooling case , indicating a radiation efficiency much smaller than unity , in contrast to the radiative regime assumption of @xcite , where they did not take into account low energy constraints .    in @xcite",
    ", it is assumed that the lat data at @xmath361 with slope @xmath362 arises from synchrotron emission in the regime @xmath162 , i.e. , @xmath363 , in contrast to our conclusion that the synchrotron emission in the regime @xmath364 evolving with slope @xmath365 .",
    "part of the difference may be due to @xcite using the formulae of @xcite , while we used the formulae of @xcite .",
    "however , applying the constraints on @xmath366,@xmath99 , @xmath143 in @xcite and taking @xmath48 in the expression for @xmath172 from @xcite , one obtains @xmath367 at @xmath148 s. therefore , @xmath368 at @xmath369 since @xmath370 , falling in the lat band , inconsistent with the @xcite assumption .",

    "our numerical calculation shows that around the deceleration time , the flux should be reduced by a factor of @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , if the deceleration time is not larger than the duration @xmath376 , the lat light curve will be flatter at @xmath377 , which can not explain the early - time lat emission , as discussed in  5 and also strongly argued by @xcite .",

    "this leads us to identify a feature in the late xrt and uvot light curves as symptomatic of a jet break .",
    "we note however that @xcite argues that numerically the light curve break related to a jet edge as seen by an off - axis observer may appear hidden for a longer time ( weeks ) than it would be for an on - axis observer , and the alternative possibility can not be ruled out , although this being one of the brightest bursts reduces the probability of its being observed from an off - axis direction .",
