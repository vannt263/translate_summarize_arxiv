    "1 ) we introduce additional auxiliary qubit atoms in the lattice , which play a two - fold role : first , they control and _ mediate _ _ effective @xmath10-body spin interactions _ among a subset of @xmath10 system spins residing in their neighborhood in the lattice . in our scheme",
    "this is achieved efficiently making use of single - site addressability and a parallelized multi - qubit gate , which is based on a combination of strong and long - range rydberg interactions and electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , as suggested recently in ref .",
    "second , the auxiliary atoms can be optically pumped , thereby providing a dissipative element , which in combination with rydberg interactions results in _ effective collective dissipative dynamics _ of a set of spins located in the vicinity of the auxiliary particle , which itself eventually factors out from the system spin dynamics .",
    "the resulting coherent and dissipative dynamics on the lattice can be represented by , and thus simulates a master equation @xmath11+{\\cal l}\\rho$ ] @xcite , where the hamiltonian @xmath12 is the sum of @xmath10-body interaction terms , involving a quasi - local collection of spins in the lattice .",
    "the liouvillian term @xmath13 with @xmath14 in lindblad form governs the dissipative time evolution , where the many - particle quantum jump operators @xmath15 involve products of spin operators in a given neighborhood .",
    "the actual dynamics of our system is performed as a stroboscopic sequence of coherent and dissipative operations involving the auxiliary rydberg atoms over time steps @xmath16 , with the master equation emerging as a coarse grained description of the time evolution . for purely coherent dynamics governed by the hamiltonian",
    ", this is the familiar `` digital qs '' @xcite where for each time step the evolution operator is implemented via a trotter expansion @xmath17 and a certain error associated with the non - commutativity of the quasi - local interactions @xmath18 .",
    "the concept of stroboscopic time evolution is readily adapted to the dissipative case by interspersing coherent propagation and dissipative time steps @xmath19 , providing an overall simulation of the master equation by sweeping over the whole lattice with our coherent and dissipative operations .",
    "many of these steps can in principle be done in a highly parallel way , rendering the time for a simulation step independent on the system size .    in our scheme",
    "the characteristic energy scale of the many - body interaction terms is essentially the same for two - body , four- or higher - order interaction terms , and mainly limited by the fast time - scale to perform the parallel mesoscopic rydberg gate operations .",
    "we note that this is in contrast to the familiar analog simulation of hubbard and spin dynamics of atoms in optical lattices @xcite . where collisional interactions between atoms provide naturally two - body interactions , while higher order , small effective interactions and constraints are typically derived with perturbative arguments @xcite .",
    "before proceeding with the concrete physical implementation of our rydberg qs , we find it convenient to discuss special spin models and master equations of interest , starting with an explicit example : kitaev s toric code .",
    "we will discuss the realization of a more complex setup of a three - dimensional @xmath9 lattice gauge theory giving rise to a spin liquid phase in the last section .",
    "kitaev s _ toric code _ is a paradigmatic , exactly solvable model , out of a large class of spin models , which have recently attracted a lot of interest in the context of studies on topological order and quantum computation .",
    "it considers a two - dimensional setup , where the spins are located on the edges of a square lattice @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath20 is a sum of mutually commuting stabilizer operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which describe _ four - body interactions _ between spins located around plaquettes ( @xmath7 ) and vertices ( @xmath8 ) of the square lattice ( see fig .",

    "the jump operators are readily understood as operators which `` pump '' from @xmath24 into @xmath23 eigenstates of the stabilizer operators : e.g. due to the projector @xmath30 the jump operator @xmath31 will not act on states in the @xmath23 eigenspace of @xmath32 , while for @xmath24 an arbitrary one of the four spins is flipped by @xmath33 .",
    "similar arguments apply to @xmath34 efficient cooling is achieved by alternating the index @xmath35 of the spin , which is flipped . the jump operators then give rise to a random walk of anyonic excitations on the lattice , and whenever two anyons of the same type meet they are annihilated , resulting in a cooling process , see fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "note that by flipping , for example , the signs @xmath36 on selected plaquettes this dissipative dynamics will prepare excited states .",
    "our choice of the jump operator follows the idea of reservoir engineering of interacting many - body systems as discussed in ref .",
    "in contrast to alternative schemes for measurement based state preparation @xcite , here , the cooling is part of the time evolution of the system .",

    "while for imperfect gates heating events can occur ( blue solid line ) and a finite density of anyons @xmath10 remains present ( blue circles ) .",

    "we first discuss the elements of the digital qs for a small local setup , and present the extension to the macroscopic lattice system below . to be specific , we will focus on a single plaquette in the example of kitaev s toric code outlined above .",
    "the implementation of the four - body spin interaction @xmath43 and the jump operator @xmath44 uses an auxiliary qubit located at the centre of the plaquette ( see fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "the general approach then consists of three steps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) : ( i ) we first perform a gate sequence @xmath45 which encodes the information whether the four spins are in a @xmath23 or @xmath24 eigenstate of @xmath7 in the two internal states of the auxiliary atom .",
    "( ii ) in a second step , we apply gate operations , which depend on the internal state of the control qubit . due to the previous mapping",
    "these manipulations of the control qubit are equivalent to manipulations on the subspaces with fixed eigenvalues of @xmath7 .",

    "it is important to stress that within our setup , the interactions are quasi - local and only influence the spins surrounding the control qubit .",

    "an important aspect for the characterization of the final state is the measurement of correlation functions @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denote local , mutually commuting many - body observables . in our scheme , the observables",
    "@xmath97 can be measured via the mapping @xmath45 of the system information onto auxiliary qubits and their subsequent state selective detection . in analogy to noise correlation measurements in cold atomic gases @xcite",
    "the repeated measurement via such a detection scheme provides the full distribution function for the observables , and therefore allows to determine the correlation function @xmath98 in the system .",
    "consequently , in the above discussion of kitaev s toric code , the necessary string operators characterizing topological order can be detected .",
    "in the first example , we discussed the implementation of the quantum simulator for the toric code , where the ground state is given by a stabilizer state , and the extension to more complex stabilizer states is straightforward . in the following , we will show that our approach can also be extended to systems with non - commuting terms in the hamiltonian . as an example",

    "the difference accounts for errors induced by the trotter expansion due to the non - commutative terms in the hamiltonian . ]    in the following , we present the implementation of this hamiltonian within our scheme for the digital quantum simulation and demonstrate that dissipative ground state cooling can be achieved at the rokhsar - kivelson point , from where the entire phase diagram is accessible .",

    "the total time @xmath142 required for the gate is mainly limited by the duration of the raman pulse , resulting in @xmath143 . for @xmath144",
    "experimentally realistic parameters are a principal quantum number of @xmath145 for the @xmath146 state , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 , resulting in a gate speed of @xmath150 . for these parameters",
    "the required lattice spacing of the optical lattice , which is essentially given by the distance where the dimensionless interaction @xmath151 equals one , is given by @xmath152 .",
    "this lattice spacing can be achieved using standard techniques such as tuning the angle between the lattice laser beams , and it is also larger than the leroy radius , i.e. the interaction between the rydberg atoms is well described by a van der waals interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian giving rise to the constraint for the spins on the octahedra can be expressed as a sum of ising interactions , @xmath153 which allow for an efficient implementation using the general toolbox for quantum simulation .",
    "the implementation for the jump operators for the constraint is obtained in analogy to the general jump operators with the many - body gate @xmath65 replaced by the gate @xmath154 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ring exchange interaction can be written as a sum of commuting four - body interactions @xmath155 likewise , the rokhsar - kivelson term can be decomposed into @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the identity matrix .",
    "consequently , the coherent time evolution follows again from the general toolbox , while the jump operators for cooling into the ground state at the rokhsar - kivelson point effectively cool into the zero eigenvalue eigenstate of the operators @xmath158b_{p } = \\frac{1}{16}\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{16}c_p^{(j ) } = \\frac{1}{16}\\left[\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^8b_p^{(j)}-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^8n_p^{(j)}\\right].\\ ] ] this can be achieved by replacing the gate @xmath93 with @xmath159\\nonumber\\\\ & = &    \\prod_{j=1}^{16 } u_{c}(\\pi/2)^{-1}u_ju_{c}(\\pi/2)\\exp\\left(i\\pi/32\\sigma_{c}^{z}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\&&\\phantom{\\prod}u_{c}(\\pi/2)^{-1 } u_ju_{c}(\\pi/2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath160 .",
    "this gate operation leaves states with eigenvalue @xmath161 of @xmath116 invariant , while the @xmath24 eigenvalue picks up a phase of @xmath135 .",
    "it can be implemented as a product of many - body gates which derive directly from the standard gate @xmath65 with the combination of spin rotations ."
