    "distributing quantum resources over large distances is an important experimental challenge in quantum information science @xcite .",
    "one possibility to overcome losses in optical fibers is to implement a quantum repeater architecture @xcite where the total distance is split into several segments .",
    "entanglement between neighboring nodes in each segment is created independently and stored in quantum memories .",
    "the entanglement is then extended to longer distances by entanglement swapping .",
    "one way to create entanglement between remote material systems is by quantum interference in the detection of a single photon emitted by the atomic systems @xcite ( see [ qr]a ) .",
    "the remote atoms are excited in a coherent fashion and the emitted fields are combined at a beam splitter placed at a central location . if the two fields are indistinguishable , the information about the origin of the photon is erased and the detection of a single photon projects the two atomic systems in an entangled state .",
    "this type of entanglement creation is probabilistic , but heralded .",
    "it has been proposed both for single systems ( e.g. single atoms @xcite or nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond @xcite ) and for atomic ensembles @xcite . in the case of ensembles ,",
    "the creation of entanglement by single photon detection results in entangled number states , with one joint collective atomic excitation delocalized between the remote ensembles , as has been recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this type of entanglement is that only one photon must be created , transmitted and detected , which enables a greater probability per trial to obtain the desired entangled state , as compared to the creation of entanglement by detection of two photons @xcite .",
    "however , the drawback of this method is that it requires interferometric stability over large distances , which is generally considered to be a challenging experimental task .",
    "phase noise in the quantum channels acts as a decoherence in the entanglement generation , in the same way as atomic dephasing acts as a decoherence in the entanglement storage process .",
    "= 0.3    several solutions have been proposed to alleviate the phase stability problem .",
    "1 ) first , the two atomic systems can be excited in a sagnac interferometer configuration @xcite ( see [ qr]b ) . in this way",
    ", the excitation lasers for the two memories and the emitted photons travel the same path in a counterpropagating fashion .",
    "hence , as long as the phase fluctuations are slower than the travel time , the phase difference is automatically zero .",
    "2 ) the second possibility is to stabilize actively the phases , with respect to a reference laser .",
    "this requires that the phase fluctuations are not too fast in order to be able to implement a feed - back loop @xcite .",
    "3 ) finally , a third possible solution has been proposed in @xcite for the case of atomic ensembles , by implementing two chains of entangled memories in parallel , with the same quantum channel linking them . in that case ,",
    "entanglement is generated independently in the two chains , and stored in the memories . by selecting the case where at least one excitation is present in each node",
    ", one can obtain an effective two - excitations maximally entangled state .",
    "effective entanglement between remote quantum nodes can thus be created by asynchronous two photon quantum interference @xcite . in that case",
    ", the phase of the quantum channels must be constant only during the time @xmath1 between the detection heralding the entanglement in the two chains .",
    "while there is an active theoretical activity in developing new quantum repeaters architectures based on entanglement generation by single photon quantum interference @xcite , no study has addressed so far the feasibility of the implementation of such protocols in installed telecom networks with respect to phase stability . in this context",
    ", we report in this paper measurements of the phase noise in long fiber interferometers over short timescale .",
    "our results show that the phase in long optical fibers ( several tens of km ) remains stable at an acceptable level for times of order of 100 @xmath0s , in realistic environments .",
    "the measurement of phase noise in optical fibers is also relevant for other applications .",
    "there is currently an active area of research aiming at the transmission of frequency references over large distances in optical fibers , in order to synchronize or compare remote optical - frequency atomic clocks @xcite . in this case",
    ", the phase noise in the fiber link directly translates into a spectral broadening of the frequency reference . to preserve the precision of optical clocks ,",
    "the light should be transmitted with sub femtosecond jitter over long distances through the fiber .",
    "noise cancellation schemes have been developed , which work well as long as the phase noise is negligible during the round trip time of the fiber @xcite .    in order to perform the phase noise measurements",
    ", we used two interferometric techniques , namely sagnac and mach - zehnder ( ) interferometry .",
    "the sagnac configuration allows us to study the feasibility of solving the phase stability problem by cancelling the phase fluctuations with the geometry of the interferometer .",
    "moreover it permits us to visualize the effects of phase fluctuations directly on the visibility of first order interference , which can then be used as a measure of the fidelity of the quantum communication .",
    "however , with this technique we can infer the phase noise only on a time scale shorter than the travel time of the pulses in the interferometer . on the other hand",
    ", the  interferometer provides some information about the structure of the phase fluctuations over larger time scales .",
    "this information is important for the two other proposed techniques to alleviate the phase noise problem , namely active stabilization and asynchronous two - photon interference .",
    "the measurements were performed both in spooled optical fibers the laboratory , and in installed commercial fibers in an urban environment .",
    "the details of the measurements are presented in sections [ sagnac ] and [ mz ] and discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "= 0.48    information about the phase noise of a long optical fiber can be inferred by measuring first order interference fringes in a sagnac interferometer . in such an interferometer",
    "the two paths correspond to pulses counterpropagating in the same fiber loop . for small distances",
    ", the phase in the loop does nt have the time to fluctuate during the travel time of the pulses , which leads to a zero phase difference between the two paths of the interferometer . by changing the phase difference between the two pulses ( for instance using time resolved phase modulation ) it is possible to obtain an interference fringe .",
    "if there is no phase noise in the interferometer during the travel time of the pulses , the visibility will be perfect .",
    "as mentioned before , this phase fluctuation cancellation technique can be exploited in order to generate remote entanglement of quantum memories by single photon interference . however , for long fibers , the phase might have time to fluctuate during the travel time of the pulses , because the pulses travel through a given segment of the fiber at different times . in that case , the visibility of the interference fringe will be reduced .",
    "hence , one can use the visibility as a measure of the phase noise over a time scale shorter than the time of propagation of the light in the interferometer .",
    "let us now investigate in more detail the relation between visibility and phase noise .",
    "consider that the intensity @xmath2 at the output of the interferometer is of the form i()=[eq intensity ] where @xmath3 is the average intensity and @xmath4 is a constant phase given by the difference between the two arms of the interferometer . in this model the instantaneous value of intensity i is given by a particular phase fluctuation @xmath5 .",
    "next we assume that the distribution of phase fluctuations reads p()=e^- [ eq distribution ] where @xmath6 is the width of the gaussian distribution .",
    "the assumption of a gaussian distribution of the phase noise will be justified by our results presented in the next section . in order to obtain some characteristic phase noise independent value @xmath7 of intensity",
    ", one has to average the intensity described by ( [ eq intensity ] ) , such that i = ^_-dp()i ( ) = ( 1+e^- ) we can thus find a direct relation between the visibility @xmath8 and the distribution of the phase noise described by @xmath6 v = e^- [ eq visibility ]    = 0.48    let us now describe our experimental setup , shown in [ fig sagnac ] .",
    "the light source is a single mode distributed feedback laser diode at 1556 nm ( linewidth 1 mhz ) .",
    "the light emitted by the laser is modulated by an integrated linbo@xmath9 optical amplitude modulator ( am ) which creates 1 - 10 @xmath0s rectangular light pulses with repetition rate 1 khz .",
    "these pulses are split at the fiber beam splitter and sent to the sagnac interferometer .",
    "we apply the phase to only one of the pulses by gating a phase modulator ( pm ) with a pulsed variable voltage .",
    "finally , the interfering light pulses are combined at the fiber beam splitter and the resulting interference signal is detected using a detector and oscilloscope .",
    "the area of the pulse is then plotted as a function of the phase shift .",
    "the phase is scanned linearly , which results in a sinusoidal interference fringe .",
    "the visibility of the fringe is determined by a sinusoidal fit .",
    "all the visibilities were obtained after the subtraction of the detector noise from the signal .",
    "the phase in the modulator is varied slowly in order to sample the entire gaussian distribution defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq distribution ] ) .",
    "the typical time for scanning one fringe is chosen to be about 10 min .",
    "we used several polarization controllers ( pc ) in order to ensure the optimal polarization alignment . at the same time we made sure that this alignment was quite stable over tens of minutes so that the quick intensity changes are not due to polarization fluctuations . for the experiment in the laboratory conditions",
    ", we used spools with different lengths .",
    "the spools were inserted in a polystyren box in order to prevent fast thermal fluctuations . on the other hand , for the measurement in installed fibers",
    ", our building is directly connected to the commercial swisscom network .",
    "we had at our disposal two links connecting our building to two different telecom stations in the geneva area , about 17.5 km and 18.25 km away from our building , respectively .",
    "each link was composed of two fibers , connected together at the telecom stations . in this way",
    ", we could use two fibers loops of 35 km and 36.5 km , respectively , going to different locations . by connecting the two loops together at our building ,",
    "one can form a 71.5  km long sagnac interferometer . to connect our lab to the telecom network , we used about 150 m of optical fibers .",
    "= 0.42    a typical example of interference fringe is shown in [ fringe ] , for the 36.5 km long sagnac interferometer in installed fibers .",
    "one can see that the signal is very stable , even for duration of order of minutes .",
    "this is important especially in the case when one needs to accumulate sufficiently large photon statistics .",
    "we investigated the dependence of visibility on the fiber length both in laboratory and real world conditions .",
    "the results are shown in [ fig visibility ] .",
    "for short distances , the visibility is almost perfect . as expected , a slight decrease of the visibility",
    "can be observed when increasing the fiber length , due to phase fluctuations during the travel time of optical pulses .",
    "however , the visibilities remain high even for fiber lengths @xmath10 75 km .",
    "note that in the 71.5 km interferometer in installed fibers , there is a significant change in visibility for the measurements performed during the day or the night . from the measured fringe visibilities , and",
    "attributing all the loss of visibility to phase noise , we are able to express an upper bound for the mean phase change for a given distance using ( [ eq visibility ] ) .",
    "for instance , for the maximal distance in installed fibers @xmath11 km , the measured visibility during the day @xmath12 corresponds to @xmath13 rad and the measured visibility during the night @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath15 rad for a travel time 360 @xmath0s .",
    "one can see that the measurements performed in installed fibers in the urban environment give similar visibilities than those in the laboratory ( within the error ) .",
    "the cases where the visibilities in the installed fibers are better than visibilities expected in the laboratory ( 25 km interferometer in the laboratory and the 35 and 36.5 km interferometer in the telecom network ) might be explained by global versus local disturbance : the long fibers used in laboratory were on spools and when some disturbance like a mechanical vibration appeared , it was applied simultaneously to the whole length of the fiber whereas in the telecom network such disturbance applied only to the local part of fiber .",
    "as mentioned above , sagnac interferometry allows us only to obtain information about the integrated phase noise over a time - scale shorter than the travel time of a light pulse in the interferometer . in order to obtain a more quantitative analysis over longer time scales",
    ", we used mach - zehnder interferometry .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in [ fig mz ] .",
    "the two arms of the interferometer are composed by the two fiber loops connecting our lab to the two telecom stations . in order to balance the lengths of the two arms , we had to add a spool of 1.5 km of fiber in our lab .",
    "we introduced a polarization controller into one arm of the interferometer in order to align the polarization at the output coupler . similarly to the experiment with the sagnac interferometer , we verified that there are no quick intensity changes due to polarization fluctuations .",
    "the resulting interference signal is detected by a detector and an oscilloscope with 1  ghz and 6  ghz bandwidth respectively .",
    "we verified that there are no significant changes of light intensity at the detector in the time scale of few @xmath0s .",
    "it is thus sufficient to use a few datapoints to describe the intensity changes for this time difference without loss of information . in our case",
    "the typical distance between two adjacent datapoints was 2 - 4 @xmath0s , which is then the final temporal resolution of the measurement .",
    "we also assured that during measurement in this setup the lengths of both arms of the interferometer were equilibrated in such a way that their difference was of order of centimeters .",
    "this is much less than the coherence length of the laser ( 66 m in the optical fiber ) corresponding to the measured bandwidth 1 mhz , and leads to negligible phase noise induced by the frequency drift of the laser . in this section",
    "we will focus only on measurements performed in the installed fibers .",
    "= 0.48    if we consider two interfering light fields , we can find the dependence of measured intensity @xmath2 on time @xmath16 in the form [ i ] i(t)=+i_min where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are maximal and minimal measured intensity and @xmath4 is the actual phase difference between the two fields .",
    "for our purposes we call from now on this phase difference simply the phase .",
    "an example of such a measurement is shown in [ fig mz_raw ] . from the measurement of @xmath19 and using ( [ i ] ) we can directly find the time dependence of the phase .",
    "however , around maxima and minima of the signal , a relatively large change in the phase causes only a small change in the intensity and thus introduces a bigger error to the data analysis . on the other hand , on the slope of a measured signal ,",
    "a relatively small change of phase causes significant change in the intensity .",
    "for this reason we restricted our analysis only to this region , omitting maxima and minima ; this provides us with less data but should nt qualitatively change obtained statistics .",
    "we also verified that the interference is nt caused by retroreflections in the interferometer .",
    "= 0.48    once we calculated the temporal evolution of the phase , we can investigate the phase changes as a function of time . for a time difference @xmath20 we can find a set of corresponding phase differences @xmath21",
    ", where @xmath22 , and the final phase difference as the average over @xmath23 , schematically : : \\{_^1,_^2 ,  } _ [ eq d_phis ] an example of dependence @xmath24 vs. @xmath20 is shown in [ fig mz_d_phi ] .",
    "actually every measurement will give a slightly different ( but still monotonously rising)curve , i.e. the times needed for , e.g. , a phase change of 0.1 rad will be different .",
    "the different measurements are then averaged and statistical errors can be calculated as shown later in [ fig day time ] .",
    "another interesting information one can obtain from such a set of phase differences is their distribution .",
    "the distribution for a time difference corresponding to the travel time in the interferometer ( @xmath25s ) is shown in [ fig dist ] . in the data processing to obtain this curve , we assume that long terms phase drifts are negligible on this time scale and that the phase fluctuations are random . thus a positive ( negative ) intensity change is attributed to a positive ( negative ) phase change . hence , the @xmath26 are considered here without absolute value . the gaussian fit in [ fig dist ] shows that the phase noise distribution corresponds well to a gaussian distribution .",
    "this can be explained if we describe the phase fluctuations in terms of random walk theory @xcite .",
    "= 0.4    note that the gaussian distribution ( ( [ eq distribution ] ) ) describes fully the phase noise at a given time @xmath20 .",
    "it is possible to show that there is a direct relationship between this distribution and @xmath27 calculated in ( [ eq d_phis ] ) , such that = | |= [ eq d_p ]    = 0.4    one of the possibilities to quantify the quick phase changes is to fix some value of the phase difference , which can still be tolerated in the mentioned quantum communication protocols and look what is the corresponding time needed for such phase change .",
    "we took for example the value of @xmath28 rad , which according to ( [ eq visibility ] ) corresponds to a visibility of 99.5@xmath29 and we found the corresponding time intervals @xmath30 .",
    "this value will be further justified in the following section .",
    "we investigated how these time intervals changed in installed fibers as a function of the time of day .",
    "the results are plotted in [ fig day time ] .",
    "it is obvious that the phase is more disturbed during the day , than during the night , with @xmath30 moving from @xmath10100 @xmath0s during the day to @xmath10 350 @xmath0s during the night .",
    "this suggests that a big part of the induced phase noise is due to vibration caused by external disturbances , e.g. traffic .",
    "in this section , we discuss in more detail the results obtained with the two interferometric methods . a first interesting point to consider",
    "is the dependance of the measured phase noise on fiber length .",
    "a common assumption is that the variance of the phase noise @xmath31 is proportional to the length of fiber @xmath32 , where the constant of proportionality is the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "( ) = dl for the measurements in the sagnac configuration , we can express the diffusion coefficient as a function of the width @xmath6 and using ( [ eq visibility ] ) as a function of the visibility @xmath8 .",
    "d = = ^2 = -2ln(v ) [ eq d ]    = 0.42    [ fig d ] shows the calculated diffusion coefficient as a function of fiber length both for spooled fibers in laboratory and for installed fibers .",
    "we observe that different fiber lengths yield the similar diffusion coefficient ( of order of @xmath33 ) .",
    "this confirms the assumption that the variance of phase noise is proportional to the fiber length . as expected from [ fig visibility ] , there is however a difference for the value of @xmath34 obtained for the 71.5 km sagnac interferometer in installed fibers during the day and during the night .",
    "this differences might be due to two factors .",
    "( 1 ) the phase noise is larger during the day than during the night , as shown in [ fig day time ] .",
    "( 2 ) in this analysis , all the loss of visibility is attributed to the phase noise , such that the coefficient d is an upper bound .",
    "for the 71.5 km interferometer however , the alignment of polarization was difficult due to a noisy signal . in this case",
    ", it is thus likely that a part of the visibility loss is also caused by a polarization mismatch .",
    "note that we do not observe a significant difference between day and night for the sagnacs interferometers of lengths 35 km and 36.5 km .",
    "this might be due to the fact that in this case the whole fiber is in the same cable .",
    "let us now discuss the results obtained with the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "if we consider the theory of random walk to explain the structure of phase noise , we should obtain a histogram , i.e. a distribution of phase noise in the form of a gaussian , see [ fig dist ] . at this point the theory corresponds well to the observed results .",
    "the other conclusion arising from random walk theory is that the function plotted in [ fig mz_d_phi ] should depend on @xmath20 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 . in our case , we find value of @xmath37 ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 . at this point , we do not have a model for the phase fluctuations that explains the observed dependance .",
    "we also considered the effect of a potential slow thermal drift on the observed phase noise . a phase shift of 0.1 rad corresponds to an optical path length difference between the two arms of the interferometer of about 25 nm for a wavelength of 1550 nm . assuming a drift constant in time ( for instance due to a slow temperature variation ) ,",
    "an optical path difference of 25 nm in 100 @xmath0s would lead to an optical path difference of 90 cm per hour .",
    "we measured the optical lengths of the two fibers with a high resolution photon counting optical time domain reflectometer @xcite , and found that the difference remained constant within a few cm over the course of 12 hours ( from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m. ) .",
    "this shows that the observed phase noise is most likely due to other causes than a slow thermal drift .",
    "finally , let us compare the results obtained with the two methods .",
    "from the phase noise @xmath38 obtained with a mach - zehnder interferometer with arm length @xmath39 , one can predict the visibility one should obtain with a sagnac interferometer of length @xmath40 , with the help of ( [ eq visibility ] ) and ( [ eq d_p ] ) . in our case",
    "the visibility calculated from the mach - zehnder interferometer of @xmath41 km is @xmath42 during the night ( between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. ) and @xmath43 during the day .",
    "this is compatible ( within the error ) with the results for the sagnac interferometer of 71.5 km shown in [ fig visibility ] .",
    "let us now analyze our results with respect to applications in quantum repeaters .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there are several ways to alleviate the phase stability problems .",
    "the sagnac configuration presented in section [ sagnac ] is very similar to the self - aligned configuration proposed in @xcite . in this setup ,",
    "the two ensembles are excited by a laser pulse travelling in opposite direction in the same fiber loop . in this way ,",
    "the optical path lengths for the two excitation / emission paths are identical , as long as the phase of the loop is stable for a duration equal to the travel time .",
    "our measurement in urban environment shows that first order interferences with high visibilities can be obtained in such a configuration , for fiber lengths up to  71.5 km ( corresponding to a maximal physical distance between the two nodes of  35 km and 36.5 km ) .",
    "this shows that from the point of view of phase stability , it is feasible to generate entanglement by single photon quantum interference between two quantum memories separated by tens of km , without active stabilization .",
    "moreover , by using the measurements of the diffusion coefficients ( during the night ) presented in [ fig d ] and ( [ eq d ] ) , visibilities higher than 90@xmath29 can be inferred for fiber lengths of order 250 km .    alternatively , it is also possible to generate entanglement by single photon detection with a mach - zehnder configuration . in that case",
    "however the phase must be stable for the duration of the experiment , i.e. for a duration several orders of magnitude longer than the typical time of phase fluctuations .",
    "hence , in this configuration it is necessary to stabilize the phase actively .",
    "our measurement shows that the phase remains constant at an acceptable level for quantum communication purposes ( see below ) for duration of order of 100 @xmath0s so that the phase noise at frequencies higher than a few tens of khz can be neglected .",
    "active stabilization at this frequency range seems within reach of current technology ( although it remains experimentally challenging ) .",
    "there is currently an active experimental effort to transmit phase references over long distances in optical fibers . in this context , the distribution of a phase reference with sub femtosecond jitter over an actively stabilized fiber link of 32 km length has been recently demonstrated @xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction , in order to perform quantum protocols with entangled number states involving one delocalized excitation , one possibility is to implement two chains of entangled memories in parallel and to obtain an effectively entangled state ( with two excitations ) by post - selection in the final stage @xcite . in that case",
    "the relevant time scale for phase stability is the time between successful entanglement generations in the two chains . for standard quantum repeater protocols based on asynchronous two photon interference",
    ", @xmath44 can be quite long ( orders of seconds ) , mainly because of the small probability of success per trial and of the limited repetition rate due to the communication time @xcite .",
    "this means that the phase of the quantum channels should remain stable during this time which is four orders of magnitude longer than the typical phase fluctuation time measured in our experiment ( 100 @xmath0s ) .",
    "hence in that case , either a self - aligned configuration or an active stabilization are required .",
    "however , it is in principle possible to increase by several orders of magnitude the entanglement generation rate with spatial , spectral or temporal multiplexing . for example , in @xcite , it was suggested that the use of quantum memories allowing the storage of multiple temporal modes ( multimode memories ) could decrease the required time @xmath1 in order to generate successful entanglement between remote quantum nodes from seconds to tens of microseconds .",
    "our measurement shows that the phase fluctuations on this time scale are acceptable .",
    "let us finally evaluate how the phase noise propagates in a quantum repeater architecture and estimate the fidelity that might be obtained with the measured phase noise . in the following analysis for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider only the errors caused by the phase noise .",
    "for one elementary link of quantum repeater the ideal state of two entangled memories can be written in the form @xcite | _ i d = ( |0 1 + e^i|1 0 ) [ eq psi i d ] where @xmath45 is the phase difference in between the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "if we consider the phase noise in optical fibers , the state for a particular phase shift @xmath26 is : | = ( |0 1 + e^i(+)|1 0 ) [ eq psi real ] for phase shifts @xmath26 distributed with gaussian distribution given by ( [ eq distribution ] ) , the state of the entangled memories is now given by the density matrix @xmath46 _ real = d p ( ) | | fidelity can then be calculated from its definition f = _ i d | _ real | _ i d = ( 1+e^- ) [ eq fidelity ] the important thing to point out is that if we consider not one but @xmath47 elementary links and the corresponding entanglement connections @xcite , the phase shift in ( [ eq psi real ] ) becomes @xmath48 and factor @xmath6 in ( [ eq fidelity ] ) for fidelity becomes @xmath49 .",
    "this is the way the errors add in the considered protocol .    as an example we consider two distant locations separated by 1000 km , connected with 8 elementary links @xcite .",
    "we fixed a desired fidelity @xmath50 for the entangled state between the two distant places .",
    "the fidelity can be also expressed in terms of observed visibility as @xmath51 . using ( [ eq visibility ] ) and the fact that @xmath52 , we can calculate the allowed mean phase change @xmath53 for the 36.5 km segment of fiber .",
    "we find @xmath54 rad , which motivated our choice of this value in section [ mz ] .",
    "note that for experimental realizations , other factors will also contribute to the decrease of fidelity , such as dark counts , probability of generating multiple photons , distinguishability between photons and memory errors .",
    "the creation of entanglement between remote quantum memories by single photon interference is attractive for quantum repeaters applications because it is much less sensitive to loss than two - photon schemes , and thus it increases the probability per trial to generate the desired entangled state .",
    "this in turns results in shorter times to distribute entanglement over long distances .",
    "however , the need for interferometric phase stability over long distances is generally considered problematic from an experimental point of view . in this context , we presented an experimental investigation of phase fluctuations over short time scales in long fiber interferometers .",
    "our results show that the phase remains stable at an acceptable level for quantum communication protocols for durations of order 100 @xmath0s for a 36.5 km long mach - zehnder interferometer in installed telecom fibers .",
    "this typical time for phase fluctuation should allow an active stabilization of the phase for long interferometers .",
    "we also showed experimentally that the phase fluctuations in installed fibers are slow enough to guarantee high visibility first order interference for sagnac interferometers over length of several tens of km , without any active stabilization .",
    "this demonstrates the feasibility of observing single photon interference over these lengths , and of its use to generate entanglement between remote quantum memories without active phase stabilization .",
    "our measurements have been performed in installed fibers in a noisy urban environment .",
    "an increase in stability is thus expected when using underwater fibers .",

    "<S> many protocols for long distance quantum communication require interferometric phase stability over long distances of optical fibers . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the phase noise in long optical fibers both in laboratory environment and in installed commercial fibers in an urban environment over short time scales ( up to hundreds of @xmath0s ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the phase fluctuations during the travel time of optical pulses in long fiber loops are small enough to obtain high visibility first order interference fringes in a sagnac interferometer configuration for fiber lengths up to 75 km . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure phase fluctuations in a mach - zehnder interferometer in installed fibers with arm length 36.5 km . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that the phase noise respects gaussian distribution and measure the mean phase change as a function of time difference . </S>",
    "<S> the typical time needed for a mean phase change of 0.1 rad is of order of 100 @xmath0s , which provides information about the time scale available for active phase stabilization . </S>",
    "<S> our results are relevant for future implementations of quantum repeaters in installed optical fiber networks . </S>"
