    "this paper suggests a new approach to questions of rationality of threefolds based on category theory .",
    "it was inspired by recent work of v.shokurov and by a.kuznetsovs idea about the griffiths component ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this work is a natural continuation of ideas developed in @xcite , @xcite and of ideas of kawamata and his school .",
    "we first extend classical example of artin and mumford to construct a sextic double solid @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes and torsion in @xmath2 .",
    "the construction is based on an approach by m.gross and suggests close relation between artin and mumford example and the sextic double solid @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes .",
    "this example , a novelty on its own , opens a possibility of series of interesting examples  @xmath3 with 10 singular points and double covering of quadric ramified in octic with 20 nodal singular points .    in this paper",
    "we start investigating these examples from the point of view of homological mirror symmetry ( hms ) .",
    "we consider the mirrors of the sextic double solid @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes , of the fano variety @xmath3 with 10 singular points in general position and of the double covering of quadric ramified in octic with 20 nodal singular points .",
    "we note that the monodromy around the singular fiber over zero of the landau ",
    "ginzburg models is strictly unipotent in all these examples , which suggests that the categorical behavior should be very similar to the one of the artin ",
    "mumford example .",
    "we conjecture that the reason for categorical similarity in all these examples is that they contained the category of an enriques surface as a semiorthogonal summand in their derived categories .",
    "this is done in section 5 , where we introduce landau  ginzburg models and compare their singularities .    in section 6",
    "we introduce several new rationality invariants coming out of the notions of spectra and enhanced noether ",
    "lefschetz spectra of categories .",
    "we give a conjectural categorical explanation of the examples from sections 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .",
    "the novelty ( conjecturally ) is that non - rationality of these examples can not be picked by orlov spectra but it is detected by the noether  lefschetz spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 , 3 , 4 we describe classical calculations of a sextic double solid @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes .",
    "section 5 contains some mirror considerations studying some landau  ginzburg models .",
    "section 6 suggests a general categorical framework for studying the phenomena in sections 25 .",
    "the paper is based on examples we have analyzed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all these suggest a direct connection between monodromy of landau  ginzburg models , spectra and wall crossings in the moduli space of stability conditions , which was partially explored in @xcite .",
    "this paper is a humble attempt to shed some light on this connection .",
    "we expect that further application of this method will be the theory of three dimensional conic bundles  a small part of huge algebro  geometric heritage of v.shokurov ( see remark  [ remark : quadric solid ] ) .",
    "in particular we expect that noether ",
    "lefschetz spectra of categories would allow us to prove nonrationality of new classes of conic bundles  classes where the method of intermediate jacobian does not work .",
