    "the non - detection of ultra - fast outflows in the prototypical object pg  1211 + 143 in the current observation ( and also previous observations subsequent to the first _ xmm - newton _ detection ) raises several questions on how common these might be in this and other sources .",
    "systematic searches suggest that @xmath46 of objects observed with _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ show them",
    ". this number could be much lower if a careful statistical search is performed that takes into account physical baseline models along with their observational uncertainties .",
    "this comes in the form of including the best fit uncertainties in simulating spectra during the monte carlo tests and also allowing for that uncertainty when fitting for narrow features at arbitrary energies in the spectrum .",
    "the true extent of ufo s could be affected by the significance of any single detection , which we have discussed , and also by their variability .",
    "a non - detection could simply be due to the fact they are transient in nature as suggested by the the simulations @xcite .",
    "the case of pg  1211 + 143shows that the ufo is seen in one out of eleven observations ( _ xmm - newton _ , _ suzaku _ , _ chandra _ and _ nustar _ ) between 2001 and 2014 . with the caveat that we still have small numbers ,",
    "if one assumes the observations are done randomly as far as the agn is concerned , it appears that a variability argument would also suggest that the contribution of ufo s is an order of magnitude lower than previously inferred .",
