    "of many recently discovered fe - based superconductiors and related materials @xcite the so called 122 family ( @xmath10fe@xmath4as@xmath4 with @xmath11 alkaline earth and eu ) , is the most studied .",
    "@xcite this family allows for substitution on all three cystallographic sites and , as a result , an intricate combination of carrier - doping and anisotropic steric effects can be studied , while maintaining the same , tetragonal , thcr@xmath4si@xmath4 - type crystal structure .",
    "the main body of the published work on the 122 family has been focused on the @xmath10(fe@xmath2@xmath12)@xmath4as@xmath4 series with transition metals , @xmath13 , being substituted for fe.@xcite this is due to the relative ease of growing homogeneous , high quality single crystals .",
    "substitutions for @xmath10 , as in the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , @xcite or for as as in the bafe@xmath4(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath4 series @xcite have been explored , but both series require significant efforts to achieve homogeneity and/or reasonable size of the crystals .    at first glance ,",
    "substitution for ba [ ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 ] , fe [ ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 ] or as [ bafe@xmath4(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath4 ] in bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 , as well as application of pressure , @xcite to this parent compound result in similar phase diagrams .",
    "@xcite first , the temperature of structural and magnetic transitions decreases , then superconductivity emerges with a a region of coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism . on further substitution ( or under higher pressure ) the magnetic and structural transitions are suppressed , the superconducting transition temperature passes through the maximum and gradually goes to zero , or to a small finite value as in the case of complete substitution of k for ba , in kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "closer examination of the globally similar phase diagrams though , point to clear differences in details that allow to gain an insight into the complex physics of these materials .",
    "@xcite    na - substitution for the @xmath10 appears to be one of the less - explored branches in the 122 family tree .",
    "a possibility to induce superconductivity by na - substitution in cafe@xmath4as@xmath4 was realized fairly early , @xcite whereas a tentative @xmath15 phase diagram for the ca@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series was published a few years later .",
    "@xcite a sr@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 sample with @xmath1 value as high as @xmath16 k was studied in ref . , and",
    "later an evolution of the physical properties in sr@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( for a rather limited range of substitution , @xmath17 ) was presented .",
    "@xcite    the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , where na is substituted for ba , offers an almost complete range of substitution @xcite .",
    "one of the complications for this series is that its end member , nafe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( @xmath18 k ) , was reported to be metastable , and as such can not be formed by a solid - state reaction technique , but can only be obtained by the mild oxidation of nafeas .",
    "@xcite additionally , deviations from stoichiometry ( na@xmath19fe@xmath20as@xmath4 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) for the obtained material were suggested.@xcite    in generic terms , for the overlapping @xmath23 - values , the @xmath15 phase diagram of the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series @xcite bears a close similarity to that of the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , @xcite but a comprehensive study of the na - doped series and a direct comparison with the results for its k - doped counterpart would help to address several issues of relevance for the physics of fe - based superconductors .",
    "first , in the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series several experimental observations point to a significant modification of the superconducting state ( possibly change in superconducting pairing symmetry ) for k - concentration , @xmath24 . @xcite it would be of interest to examine the overdoped part of the phase diagram of the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series for similar features .",
    "second , in addition to the low temperature antiferromagnetic / orthorhombic phase , that is ubiquitous in fe - based superconductors , an antiferromagnetic tetragonal , @xmath25 , phase was reported in the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series over a narrow na - concentration region around @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite the tip of the narrow @xmath25 dome was suggested to be at @xmath27 k ; at lower temperatures this new magnetic phase was suggested to co - exist with superconductivity .",
    "the bulk physical properties of the members of the series close to and in the @xmath25 phase as well as the effect of this magnetic phase on superconductivity are interesting to study in detail .    in this work",
    "we utilize the same approach as we did in the recent studies of the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series ; @xcite we present two set of data for the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , with na - concentrations covering underdoped , optimally doped and overdoped regions of the @xmath15 phase diagram .",
    "the first set consists of the data on the evolution of the jump in heat capacity at the superconducting transition .",
    "many fe - based , 122 superconductors follow the empirical trend suggested in ref . and expanded in refs .",
    ", the so - called bnc scaling , @xmath28 .",
    "this set is to be compared with the data on the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , @xcite that show clear deviation from the bnc scaling for k - concentration @xmath24 .",
    "the second set contains the initial ( @xmath29 kbar ) pressure dependencies of the superconducting transition temperatures , @xmath30 similar in scope to the data reported for ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite and ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite such data evaluate possible equivalence of pressure and doping that was suggested for several 122 series .",
    "@xcite moreover , under favorable circumstances such a dataset can shed light on the details of the mechanism of superconductivity . @xcite",
    "homogeneous , single phase ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 polycrystalline powder with nominal @xmath31 , and 0.9 were synthesized by a variation of a previously reported procedure .",
    "@xcite handling of all starting materials was performed in an ar - filled glove box .",
    "mixtures of ba , na , and feas were loaded in alumina crucibles , which were sealed in nb tubes under argon , and then sealed again in fused silica tubes under vacuum .",
    "the mixtures were heated twice at @xmath32 for 1 and 3 days respectively , and at @xmath33 for 1 day , with quenching in air . between each annealing cycle , the mixtures were ground to a fine , homogeneous powder . after the third annealing step , the powder was pressed into a pellet , re - loaded into the alumina crucible , sealed first inside the nb tube , and then into a fused silica tube .",
    "the pellet was heated at @xmath33 for approximately 1 day , before quenching in air .",
    "the superconducting transition temperatures of the samples , as determined by magnetization measurements , were compared with those in the previously reported @xmath15 phase diagram @xcite in order to confirm the @xmath23 values of the compositions .",
    "the synthesis of homogeneous samples of ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 is challenging due to volatility of na upon heating .",
    "for this reason , sealed nb tubes are utilized to suppress and contain na vaporization at high temperature .",
    "this is particularly crucial in the highly underdoped region ( @xmath34 ) where small changes in @xmath23 can lead to large changes in @xmath1 .",
    "because of the sensitivity of @xmath1 in the highly underdoped samples with respect to na content , the pellets of these samples needed to be annealed multiple times for shorter durations in order to achieve sharp superconducting transitions . additionally , for the overdoped samples",
    ", a small amount of na was added to the pelletized mixture before the final annealing in order to finely tune the @xmath23 parameter .",
    "the most highly overdoped sample , ba@xmath35na@xmath36fe@xmath4as@xmath4 , is also difficult to prepare due to its tendency to phase - segregate into an underdoped composition with higher thermal stability and a stable ternary compound nafeas ( with a different structure type ) . @xcite it should be noted here that the end - member nafe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( @xmath37 ) can not be formed by this solid - state technique , instead it can be obtained by the mild oxidation of nafeas .",
    "@xcite    low - field dc magnetization under pressure , was measured in a quantum design magnetic property measurement system , mpms-5 , squid magnetometer using a a commercial , hmd , be - cu piston - cylinder pressure cell . @xcite daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure medium and superconducting pb or sn ( to have its superconducting transition well separated from that of the sample ) as a low - temperature pressure gauge .",
    "the heat capacity was measured using a hybrid adiabatic relaxation technique of the heat capacity option in a quantum design physical property measurement system , ppms-14 , instrument .",
    "of the samples studied in this work , ba@xmath36na@xmath35fe@xmath4as@xmath4 is not superconducting , whereas ba@xmath38na@xmath39fe@xmath4as@xmath4 is superconducting , but low field , zero field cooled , magnetization measurements display two transitions .",
    "the @xmath40 sample is not included in the analysis of the jump in specific heat at @xmath1 . for @xmath41 the feature at @xmath42 k is the only feature present in the specific heat data . for this sample",
    "the difference between the data taken in zero field and 140 koe applied field was analyzed and the error bars in the obtained @xmath43 at @xmath1 value are expected to be rather large .",
    "the other samples studied in this work show a distinct feature in specific heat at @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] as an example ) .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath6 values were determined by a procedure consistent with that used in ref . .",
    "the specific heat jump data for the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series obtained in this work were added in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] to the bnc plot taken from ref . and",
    "updated by including several more recent data points taken from the evolving literature .",
    "there appears to be a clear trend : all data points ( @xmath5 ) from this study follow the bnc scaling , in agreement with the literature data for two close na - concentrations .",
    "@xcite this behavior is clearly different from that reported in the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , where the data for k - concentrations of @xmath44 clearly deviate from the bnc scaling , and is similar to previously the studied ba(fe@xmath2_tm_@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 ( _ tm _",
    "= transition metal ) series , for which the bnc scaling was observed for the samples covering the full extent of the superconducting dome . for the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , @xmath43 at @xmath1 increases and decreases as @xmath1 rises and falls to form the superconducting dome .",
    "an example of @xmath45 data taken at different pressures is shown in fig .",
    "an onset criterion was used to determine @xmath1 .",
    "alternative criteria ( e.g. maximum in @xmath46 ) yield similar pressure dependencies .",
    "the ba@xmath36na@xmath35fe@xmath4as@xmath4 sample was measured at ambient pressure and at 11.1 kbar .",
    "no traces of superconductivity down to 1.8 k were observed .",
    "the pressure dependencies of the superconducting transition temperatures of the samples with na - concentration in the range of @xmath5 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] . for the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 sample with na concentration of @xmath41 ,",
    "the pressure dependence associated with the lower temperature feature , that is consistent with the ambient pressure phase diagram , is presented .",
    "@xcite it is noteworthy that ( i ) @xmath30 are non - monotonic ( even in a limited pressure range of this work ) for two na concentrations , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; ( ii ) for all other concentrations studied in this work , both in underdoped and overdoped regimes , @xmath1 decreases under pressure .",
    "the data for ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 samples with @xmath8 and @xmath9 are shown separately in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "two pressure runs on two different samples from the same batch were performed for ba@xmath47na@xmath48fe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",

    "samples the measurements were performed on pressure increase and pressure decrease ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ( a ) , ( b ) ) . for both samples",
    "the observed non - monotonic behavior is robust and not affected by pressure cycling .",
    "one can join these two data sets by shifting the data for ba@xmath49na@xmath50fe@xmath4as@xmath4 by @xmath51 kbar along the @xmath52 - axis and by @xmath53 k along the @xmath54 - axis .",
    "we can understand the grounds for such two - axis shift if we assume that both , steric effect and hole doping , cause changes in superconducting transition temperature .    a more compact way to look at the pressure dependence of @xmath1 in the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature values obtained from specific heat and magnetization measurements are very similar and these data sets are consistent with the literature .",
    "@xcite the initial , low pressure , value of @xmath55 ( and @xmath56 ) for @xmath8 is positive and relatively high . for other na - concentrations",
    "studied the pressure derivatives of @xmath1 are negative .",
    "whereas for optimally doped and overdoped the absolute values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are rather small and change smoothly with concentration ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) , there appears to be a break of the trend in the underdoped region .",
    "[ f7 ] presents a comparison of the relative changes in superconducting transition temperature under pressure and with na - doping . for @xmath57",
    "both sets of data can be scaled reasonably well , illustrating apparent equivalence of the effect of pressure and doping on @xmath1 , suggested for other members of the 122 family @xcite and also observed in the limited range of k - concentrations for a closely related ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite this scaling however fails for na concentrations @xmath58 . not just the values of @xmath56 and @xmath59 can not be scaled in this region of concentrations , but ( except for @xmath8 ) the signs of these derivatives are different . in the underdoped region increase in @xmath23",
    "causes an increase in @xmath1 , and pressure causes decrease in @xmath1 , however in the optimally doped and overdoped regions both , increase in @xmath23 and pressure cause decrease in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , inset ) .",
    "both k and na substitutions in bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 provide hole doping and induce superconductivity with comparable maximum values of @xmath1 of @xmath60 k at similar k or na concentrations of @xmath61 .",
    "whereas in the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series a clear deviation from the bnc scaling is observed for @xmath62 , @xcite in the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series the data for @xmath5 follow the bnc scaling , @xmath28 , fairly well .",
    "this probably means that either there is no significant modification of the superconducting state ( e.g. change in superconducting gap symmetry ) in the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series over the whole studied na concentration range , or , if such modification exists , it is very subtle in its implications for the bnc scaling .",
    "the fact that the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series does not extend , in single phase form , to @xmath63 prevents us from carrying this study to pure nafe@xmath4as@xmath4 , as we were able to for kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "the negative sign of the pressure derivatives of @xmath1 for the underdoped samples ( except for @xmath8 ) is a clear indication of the non - equivalence of substitution and pressure for the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series in this range , that is different from the gross overall equivalence suggested for other 122 series .",
    "@xcite it has to be noted that for the ba(fe@xmath2_tm_@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 ( _ tm _ = transition metal ) ( at least for _ tm _ concentrations that cover the superconducting dome ) @xcite and for ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series @xcite the concentration dependence of the lattice parameters is monotonic and close to linear . for the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , the @xmath64 lattice parameter decreases with increase of @xmath23 in almost linear fashion , but the @xmath65 lattice parameter initially increases and then decreases , with a maximum at @xmath66 in its dependence of na - concentration . @xcite .",
    "although we do not know which particular structural parameter in the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series has the dominant contribution to the pressure dependence of @xmath1 , this non - monotonic behavior of @xmath67 might be responsible for the negative sign of the @xmath68 for underdoped samples .",
    "detailed structural studies under pressure would be useful for deeper understanding of this problem .    on one hand , the unusual , non - monotonic behavior of the superconducting transition temperature under pressure for the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 samples with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) could be considered to be consistent with what one would expect for a lifshitz transition .",
    "@xcite at this moment the data on the fermi surface of ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite are regarded as very similar to those for ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite , and no change of the fermi surface topology , from the arpes measurements , has been reported between the parent , bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 , compound and ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 with @xmath23 values up to 0.4 , so the lifshitz transition hypothesis seems unlikely .    on the other hand ,",
    "an important feature , unique to the @xmath15 ambient pressure phase diagram of the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series , is the existence of a distinct , narrow antiferromagnetic and tetragonal , @xmath25 , phase .",
    "@xcite both of the samples with non - monotonic pressure dependences of @xmath1 are located , at ambient pressure , close to the phase boundaries of this @xmath25 phase .",
    "it is thus possible that the observed anomalies in @xmath30 behavior for the samples with @xmath8 and @xmath9 are associated with the crossing of these phase boundaries under pressure .",
    "if this supposition is correct , the effect of the @xmath25 phase on superconductivity is different from that of the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic phase that is omnipresent in fe - as materials , since crossing of the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic phase line under pressure either has no effect on @xmath1 or this effect has previously been missed .    in summary",
    ", it appears that non - monotonic behavior of the @xmath65 crystallographic lattice parameter and the narrow antiferromagnetic tetragonal @xmath25 phase both affect the pressure dependencies of the superconducting transition temperature in the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series .",
    "synthesis of homogeneous single crystals with finely controlled na concentration around 20 - 25% and further comprehensive measurements of superconducting and magnetic properties ( and their interplay ) in this range of concentrations would be desirable to understand the distinct properties of the ba@xmath2na@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 series .",
