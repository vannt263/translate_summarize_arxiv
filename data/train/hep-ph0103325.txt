    ", obtained by acting on the hwv with lowering operators in dual anyonic realization , is also needed .",
    "masses @xmath255 of baryons @xmath256 are calculated within the dynamical @xmath123-irrep @xmath242 as @xmath257 ( with mass operator formed from anyonic operators ) to yield : @xmath258 , @xmath259_q\\alpha+[2]_q\\beta$ ] , @xmath260_q^2\\alpha+[3]_q\\beta$ ] , and @xmath261_q[3]_q\\alpha+[4]_q\\beta$ ] .",
    "one easily checks that these masses satisfy the relation ( 14 ) .",
    "this proves applicability @xcite of quantum algebras and their irreps for treating hadron mass relations _ within anyonic realization_.",
    "the model of ideal gas of @xmath0-bosons based on the algebra of @xmath0-deformed oscillators either of biedenharn - macfarlane ( bm ) type @xcite or arik - coon ( ac ) type @xcite , was recently utilized within the approach aimed to describe @xcite unusual properties of 2-particle correlations of identical pions or kaons produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the approach yields clear predictions based on explicit expressions for the intercept @xmath3 ( dependent on temperature , particle mass , pair mean momentum , _ and the deformation parameter _ @xmath0 ) .    to obtain needed observables ,",
    "one evaluates thermal averages @xmath262 , @xmath263 , where the hamiltonian @xmath264 and @xmath265 . with @xmath266_q$ ] and @xmath267 , the @xmath0-deformed distribution function results for bm - type @xmath0-bosons as @xmath268 at @xmath269 ( or @xmath270 ) , it yields bose - einstein ( b - e ) distribution , since @xmath270 recovers usual bosonic commutation relations .",
    "as seen , deviation of @xmath0-distribution ( 27 ) from the quantum b - e distribution tends towards the maxwell - boltzmann one .",
    "this means reducing of quantum statistical effects . for kaons ,",
    "whose mass @xmath271 , analogous curve gets closer ( than pion s one ) to the b - e distribution . for ac - type @xmath0-bosons ,",
    "the @xmath0-distribution is especially simple : @xmath272    to obtain explicitly the intercept @xmath3 of two - particle correlations one starts with the defining ratio @xmath273 , calculates the two - particle distribution @xmath274 and takes into account the @xmath275 .",
    "the result for ac - type @xmath0-bosons reads @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and for bm - type @xmath0-bosons , with @xmath278 , it is @xmath279 both ( [ 27 ] ) , ( [ 28 ] ) are real owing to the sum @xmath280 .",
    "the intercept @xmath3 , with @xmath281 , shows a remarkable feature : asymptotically , at large mean momentum of pion ( kaon ) pair and fixed temperature , @xmath3 tends to a constant given by the @xmath0-parameter : @xmath282 ( @xmath0 real ) for the ac - type @xmath0-bosons , and @xmath283 for the bm - type @xmath0-bosons .",
    "as conjectured in @xcite , correlations of pions and kaons are determined by the same value of @xmath0 ( a kind of universality ) .",
    "then , experimentally one should observe the tendency of merging @xmath284 and @xmath285 at large enough mean momenta , i.e. , @xmath286 .",
    "preliminary results of recent rhic / star experiment give three values @xcite @xmath287 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 for the @xmath290-intercept , obtained by averaging over three intervals of transverse momenta ( in mev / c ) : @xmath291 , @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and by integrating over rapidity in the range @xmath294 .",
    "in fig.1 the three values @xmath295 , @xmath296 , with error bars , are shown along with five curves for the intercept @xmath3 which correspond to fixing in ( 28 ) different values of the deformation angle @xmath204 , all curves being at the temperature @xmath297 mev .",
    "one can see remarkable agreement with data of the curve e obtained at @xmath298 .",
    "the other interesting curve d corresponds to @xmath299 ( twice the cabibbo angle , see footnote 2 and eq.(25 ) ) . at the same temperature @xmath297 mev ,",
    "the curve d agrees ( within error bar ) with the points @xmath300 and @xmath301",
    ". however , suffice it to take slightly higher effective temperature @xmath302 mev , and the resulting curve marked by @xmath303 _",
    "respects all the three error bars_. among different mixing angles known for hadrons , see @xcite , only the angle @xmath304 seems to be relevant to the discussed topic of intercept @xmath284 .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that just this angle @xmath304 can be the benchmark of assumed universality ( to be ) seen in 2-particle correlations since , then , @xmath305 .",
    "insisting on the asymptotical coincidence @xmath286 we may predict for kaon intercepts : _ at any transverse momentum _ , _ the intercept _",
    "@xmath285 _ of 2-kaon correlations should not exceed _ @xmath306 .",
    "a question naturally arises : does there exist more intimate connection between the two discussed applications - of the quantum algebras @xmath1 taken as flavor symmetries , on one hand , and of the algebras of @xmath0-deformed oscillators corresponding to discretized momenta of ( correlated ) pairs of pions or kaons as produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions , on the other hand ?",
    "the value of @xmath0-parameter ( given by @xmath307 ) shared by the two applications in case of octet hadrons gives a guess for possible physical reason for such a connection ( recall also the well - known fact that generating elements of @xmath1 admit realization in terms of @xmath0-deformed oscillators @xcite ) .",
    "future research possibly involving noncomutative geometry in extra dimensions should give ultimate answer .",
