    "the past few years have seen considerable growth in the theory of what might be called `` knot homologies . '' roughly speaking , these invariants are homological versions of the now  classical knot polynomials  the alexander polynomial , the jones polynomial , and their mutual generalization , the homfly polynomial . as a first approximation , we might say that a knot homology is a bigraded homology group @xmath0 associated to a knot @xmath1 .",
    "the two gradings are a `` homological grading '' ( the usual sort of grading one expects on a chain complex ) and a `` filtration grading . ''",
    "if we take the filtered euler characteristic of @xmath2 , we recover the corresponding knot polynomial .",
    "as our understanding of these objects evolves , it seems likely that the definition of a knot homology will evolve with it . as a first approximation , however , we offer the following :    a knot homology is a theory which assigns to an oriented link @xmath3 together with some auxiliary data @xmath4 a filtered chain complex @xmath5 satisfying the following properties :    1 .   the filtered euler characteristic of @xmath6 is a `` classical '' polynomial invariant of @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   the filtration on @xmath5 gives rise to a spectral sequence @xmath8 .",
    "for all @xmath9 , @xmath10 does not depend on the choice of auxiliary data @xmath11 , and is thus an invariant of the link @xmath7 .",
    "the homology of the total complex @xmath5 depends only on coarse information about @xmath7 , such as the number of components and their linking numbers .    in this formulation ,",
    "the group @xmath2 mentioned above is the @xmath12 term of the spectral sequence .",
    "one thing that makes this definition attractive is the fact that the known examples arise from rather different areas of mathematics .",
    "the idea that such an object might exist at all is due to mikhail khovanov . in @xcite",
    "he constructed a bigraded homology theory which i ll call @xmath13 , whose filtered euler characteristic is the unnormalized jones polynomial of @xmath14 .",
    "more recently , khovanov and rozansky @xcite have constructed an infinite family of of such knot homologies , one for each @xmath15 .",
    "their filtered euler characteristics give certain specializations of the homfly polynomial .",
    "( when @xmath16 one recovers @xmath13 . )",
    "our other example of a knot homology comes from gauge theory ; more precisely , from the heegaard floer homology introduced by peter ozsvth and zoltn szab @xcite .",
    "this theory naturally gives rise to a bigraded homology theory known as the knot floer homology @xcite , @xcite , which i ll denote by @xmath17 .",
    "its filtered euler characteristic is the alexander polynomial of @xmath14 , which corresponds to the case @xmath18 missing from khovanov and rozansky s construction .    at a first glance ,",
    "the two types of knot homologies appear to be quite different .",
    "although they share the formal properties listed above , they are defined and computed in very different ways , and things which are easy to see in one theory may be quite unexpected in the other .",
    "for example , it was obvious from the start that @xmath19 is the @xmath12 term of a spectral sequence , but the corresponding fact for @xmath20 was discovered by lee in @xcite , several years after the appearance of @xcite .",
    "( for the khovanov - rozansky theories , this result is due to gornik @xcite . ) on closer inspection , however , a more subtle correspondence between the two theories begins to appear .",
    "this correspondence has guided much of my own research in this area .",
    "in particular , it led to the discovery of a relation between the khovanov homology and the slice genus , which was the subject of my talk at mcmaster .",
    "rather than simply rehash this material , which is already covered in @xcite , i thought i would try to explain where it came from .",
    "the main goal of this paper , then , is to describe the above - mentioned correspondence between the khovanov homology and the knot floer homology , and to give some examples to convince the reader that it is an interesting one .",
    "this correspondence does not hold for all knots , but it is common enough that the author feels that there must be some sort of explanation . perhaps someone who reads",
    "this paper will be able to provide one .",
    "to properly explain the correspondence between the two theories , one must summarize a number of basic facts about them . as a secondary goal , we have tried to make this summary self - contained and accessible to anyone interested in learning about knot homologies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : filt ] with a brief review of some facts about filtered chain complexes .",
    "sections  [ sec : hfk ] and [ sec : kh ] describe the basic properties of the knot floer homology and the khovanov homology , respectively . we do not attempt to give definitions , but instead focus on the formal properties of these theories , their relation with classical models for the alexander and jones polynomials , and methods of computation . in section  [ sec : correspondence ] , we describe the correspondence we have in mind , and give some reasons for believing that it is interesting",
    ". finally , in sections  [ sec : examples ] and  [ sec : examples2 ] , we describe some examples of knots for which the correspondence is known to hold , as well as a few cases for which it fails . the author would like to thank matthew hedden , peter kronheimer , ciprian manolescu , peter ozsvth , and zoltn szab for many helpful conversations , and hans boden , ian hambleton , andrew nicas , and doug park for putting together a great conference .",
    "we begin by establishing some notation and conventions related to filtered chain complexes .",
    "let @xmath21 be a chain complex freely generated over @xmath22 by a finite set of generators @xmath23 .",
    "we say that @xmath24 is a bigraded complex with homogenous generators @xmath23 if we are given two gradings @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the property that if @xmath27 then @xmath28 and @xmath29 whenever @xmath30 .",
    "we refer to @xmath31 as the _ homological grading _ on @xmath32 , and @xmath33 as the _ filtration grading . _",
    "the filtration grading defines a filtration @xmath34 on @xmath32 , simply by setting @xmath35 we refer to @xmath36 as a _ downward _ filtration .",

    "the filtration @xmath36 on @xmath42 gives rise to a spectral sequence , which can be explicitly described as follows .",
    "we decompose the differential @xmath43 in terms of the preferred basis @xmath44 , setting @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 . since the number of @xmath48 s is finite , all but finitely many of the @xmath49 are @xmath50 . from the identity @xmath51",
    ", we conclude that @xmath52 as well , so @xmath53 is a chain complex",
    ". then the identity @xmath54 implies that @xmath55 is a chain complex . repeating , we obtain a sequence of chain complexes @xmath56 which eventually converges to @xmath57 .",
    "the complex @xmath58 is generally referred to as the @xmath59 term of the spectral sequence .",
    "if we are working with coefficients in a field , it is not difficult to show ( _ c.f .",

    "@xmath62 is again a bigraded complex , and the resulting spectral sequence is isomorphic to our original spectral sequence @xmath64 .    in the definition of the known knot homologies ,",
    "the following situation arises .",
    "starting from a link @xmath7 plus a choice of some additional data @xmath4 , one obtains a bigraded complex @xmath32 . a different choice of data @xmath65 gives rise to a different chain complex @xmath66 together with a filtered chain map @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath68 induces maps @xmath69 .",
    "one checks directly that the map @xmath70 is an isomorphism ; it then follows from general principles @xcite that @xmath71 is an isomorphism for all @xmath72 .",
    "the knot homology is the bigraded complex @xmath73 ; it is well - defined up to filtered isomorphism .",
    "since @xmath74 will be the primary object of our attention , we make a few comments specific to it . to begin with , observe that @xmath75 decomposes as a direct sum of complexes @xmath76 where @xmath77 is generated by those @xmath48 with @xmath78 . as a group ,",
    "then , we can decompose @xmath79 .",

    "conventionally , the alexander grading is chosen so as to define a downward filtration on @xmath17 .",
    "the filtered euler characteristic of @xmath92 is the alexander polynomial @xmath93 , and the homology of the complex @xmath89 is a single copy of @xmath22 in homological grading @xmath50 .     the positive trefoil and hopf link .",

    "we denote by @xmath270 the group generated by all generators of @xmath271 which have @xmath106-grading equal to @xmath114 . in other words , we have @xmath272 the notation @xmath273 should be understood similarly .",

    "we have @xmath274 2 .   @xmath275 .",
    "the definition is motivated by the following    alternating knots have property fk .",
    "this follows trivially from theorems  [ thm : alexalt ] and [ thm : jonesalt ] , since for an alternating knot @xmath276    what is perhaps more surprising is that a great many non - alternating knots have property fk as well . in fact",
    ", i spent about six months under the impression that property fk might hold for all knots before discovering that part ( 1 ) of the property fails for the @xmath277 torus knot .",
    "part ( 2 ) still holds in this case , and to the best of my knowledge , there still no examples known for which it fails .    in section  [ sec : examples ] , we describe several examples of knots known to have property fk .",
    "many have floer homologies and khovanov homologies which seem quite nontrivial .",
    "although it now seems likely that property fk fails for all knots which are sufficiently complicated in some sense , the level of complication needed seems rather high .",
    "when one considers how different the definitions of the two theories seem , the correspondence seems to demand an explanation .      in this section",
    ", we describe a number of arguments which might be advanced to explain the correspondence described above .",
    "although they are all at least vaguely plausible , none of them seem truly satisfactory .    *",
    "* skein theory : * the two theories share some similar basic properties .",
    "they agree for alternating knots and links , both satisfy skein exact sequences ( if one wants , the unoriented skein sequence of proposition  [ prop : khskein ] can be used to prove an oriented skein sequence similar to that of proposition  [ prop : skeinalex ] . ) and are both constrained by the requirement that they be a complex with simple homology .",
    "perhaps these requirements are enough to force property fk to hold for a large number of knots .",
    "the arguments against this idea are twofold .",
    "first , the requirements described above are fairly weak in practice .",
    "skein theory can be used to prove some things , but there are many knots for which it seems ineffective .",
    "second , the floer homology of the branched double cover satisfies at least the first two of the properties described above , but quickly begins to differ from them once you leave the realm of alternating knots . * * a master theory : * it is tempting to imagine that the two theories can be subsumed as special cases of a single construction , like that of khovanov and rozansky @xcite . the similarity might become evident in this more complicated theory .",
    "the major objection to this idea is that the khovanov - rozansky theories do not share the simple behavior that @xmath224 and @xmath119 exhibit for alternating knots .",
    "( this follows from the fact that the homfly polynomial of an alternating knot need not be alternating . ) * * a spectral sequence : * a third possibility is that the two theories are related by a spectral sequence .",
    "this is particularly attractive in light of the work in @xcite , which showed that there is a spectral sequence starting at the reduced khovanov homology and converging to the floer homology of the branched double cover .",
    "it is also supported by the fact that in all the known examples of knots which do not have property fk , the rank of the @xmath224 is greater than that of @xmath19 .",
    "this is perhaps the most attractive possibility of the three , but it is not clear where such a spectral sequence might come from .      whatever its origins , the correspondence between the floer homology and the khovanov homology has proved to be a useful guide to the study of both .",
    "the two have complementary strengths and weaknesses . on the one hand ,",
    "the khovanov homology is very simple and easy to compute with , but we have relatively little geometric intuition into its behavior . on the other , the floer homology can be difficult to compute , but comes with twenty years worth of geometric intuition developed by gauge theory .    even though we have no direct evidence of a relation between the two theories , the fk correspondence can be a useful guide , suggesting that we try to prove analogs of statements which are known in one theory directly in the other .",
    "for example , the possibility that alternating knots might be @xmath106-thin was first suggested by lee s proof of the analogous result for the khovanov homology .",
    "conversely , the fact that @xmath132 was known to be a lower bound for the slice genus suggested that one should try to prove the same thing for its counterpart @xmath252 , in the khovanov theory @xcite . as a corollary , one obtains topological proofs of some results which were previously only known via gauge theory . the classical milnor conjecture , which states that the slice genus of a torus knot is equal to its seifert genus , is one such case .",
    "( since torus knots are positive , the result is a consequence of the third property in proposition  [ prop : sprop ] . )",
    "while we were at mcmaster , bob gompf kindly pointed out another such application .",
    "namely , @xmath252 can also be used to give a gauge - theory free proof of the existance of an exotic @xmath278 .",
    "indeed , gompf has shown that to construct such a manifold , it suffices to exhibit a knot @xmath14 which is smoothly but not topologically slice .",
    "( see @xcite p. 522",
    "for a proof . ) by a theorem of freedman , any knot with alexander polynomial @xmath118 is topologically slice @xcite , so we need only find a knot @xmath14 with @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "it is not difficult to produce such a knot  for example , the @xmath281 pretzel knot will do .",
