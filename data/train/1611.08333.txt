    "the diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) model @xcite is a paradigm for out - of - equilibrium growth @xcite , of great relevance in diverse scientific and technological fields , such as oil industry , bacterial growth and even cosmology @xcite .",
    "its characteristic structure has been the subject of extensive numerical @xcite and theoretical @xcite research , that have revealed that this system can be characterized by a single fractal dimension , @xmath1 , only dependent on the euclidean dimension of its embedding space , @xmath2 . on the basis of these extensive studies",
    ", it is presently accepted that @xmath3 is the correct scaling for the off - lattice radial system in @xmath4 , whereas for higher dimensions , this consensus is not that clear , as it can be seen in table i , where we present the results obtained for @xmath5 through diverse numerical and theoretical approaches over the years .",
    "in addition , the derivation of a general and consistent analytical expression for @xmath5 in the off - lattice scenario , valid not only for @xmath4 , but in higher dimensions as well , has proven to be a non - trivial task and has been missing @xcite . among the diverse theoretical approaches to the problem",
    ", we will employ two of them as starting point of our analysis to derive this desired analytical expression .",
    "first , under the mean - field ( mf ) approach @xcite , a close expression for @xmath5 was found , as given by ,    @xmath6    although this expression is valid in off - lattice conditions , it predicts @xmath7 , for @xmath4 , which is an underestimation of the known scaling . also , it does not give a proper description of the reported data for higher dimensions , as seen in fig .  1 , where we compare this to other theoretical and numerical results .",
    "second , under a renormalization - group ( rg ) approach @xcite , it was possible to find an expression for @xmath5 , given as ,    @xmath8    with ,    @xmath9    where , @xmath10 are the growth potentials for a given lattice , and @xmath11 is inversely proportional to the probability of maximum growth , @xmath12 . from here , one may infer that the strong dependence of this model on the lattice , makes it inevitably susceptible to well known inherent lattice effects .",
    "in particular , for a square lattice in @xmath4 , it predicts a scaling of @xmath13 , which is an overestimation of the known value .",
    "based on these mf and rg results , in this work we develop a model that unifies both descriptions and provides a consistent and general expression for @xmath5 , valid off - lattice and in any spatial dimension @xmath2 as well .",
    "all the data used in this work is presented in table i.",
    "* fractal dimensions of dla .",
    "* the fractal dimensions , @xmath5 , must always satisfy the ball inequality given as , @xmath14 , where the equality is valid for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath5 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath2 , then @xmath16 is monotonically decreasing .",
    "numerical ( red ) and theoretical ( blue ) results reported over the years satisfy this condition ( references in table i ) . however , the mean - field result , @xmath17 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq01:mf ] ) , is not sufficient to establish a precise description of the data .",
    "the curve for @xmath18 is the solution derived in this work.,width=432 ]    we start by introducing , @xmath19 , a spatial correction function for dla .",
    "this quantity naturally appears from the mf equation and is crucial to validate any solution for @xmath5 . to construct it and appreciate its relevance ,",
    "let us make evident that eq .",
    "( [ eq01:mf ] ) , can be recovered from the first - order approximation in @xmath20 , of a general exponential form given by ,    @xmath21    from here , it easily follows that ,    @xmath22    then , by setting @xmath23 , the mf equation is recovered . under this description , one can observe that @xmath24 is the term that keeps all the information associated to the symmetry - breaking of space in dla . however , in the mf approximation , @xmath23 , for all @xmath2 , and in the case of @xmath4 , this predicts @xmath7 , which is not in the best agreement with results , even for higher dimensions ( see fig .  1 and table i ) .",
    "for a better understanding of @xmath19 , let us define it through eq .",
    "( [ eq04:exp ] ) , by the variable transformation ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , is the reduced co - dimension of dla . by applying the previous transformation to all the available numerical results of fractal dimensions for dla ( table i ) and comparing to the mf model , @xmath23 , in fig .",
    "2a , it is clear to see the non - trivial behavior of @xmath19 , and its important role as the spatial correction factor for dla .",
    "consequently , the problem of finding the correct scaling for dla relies on finding a suitable @xmath19 .",
    "even though there can be diverse ways to do this , we did it by extending the on - lattice rg results , to be valid in the continuous space , as follows . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq02:rg ] ) and ( [ eq03:mu ] ) , their extension to the continuous space , i.e. , @xmath27 , is done , without loss of generality , by considering @xmath28 for all @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is now a continuous function that exclusively depends on @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to ,    @xmath31    which substituted back into eq .",
    "( [ eq02:rg ] ) and solving for @xmath30 , gives ,    @xmath32    from the known solutions of @xmath10 in the square lattice , the ansatz for @xmath30 is expected to be close to @xmath33 as @xmath34 , and to tend to @xmath35 as @xmath15 . in this particular limit , @xmath36 ,",
    "is consistent with what it was previously found @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 must be such that @xmath37 remains bounded to @xmath38 $ ] , and the ball inequality , @xmath39 ( where the equality holds for @xmath15 ) is satisfied for any @xmath2 @xcite . in fig .  2b , by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq08:phi ] ) to all the available numerical results of fractal dimensions for dla , we can observe the expected behavior of @xmath30 .",
    "notice that finding a suitable ansatz for @xmath30 in this problem is equivalent to finding an independent solution for @xmath5 , through the extension of the rg equation to the continuous space .",
    "therefore , what we finally obtain here , is a solution to our problem in which the extended rg description , eq .",
    "( [ eq07:muphi ] ) , provides the correction factor through @xmath19 , to the mf expression itself , eq .",
    "( [ eq04:exp ] ) , needed to convey a consistent and unified description of @xmath5 .    finally , since @xmath19 depends directly on @xmath5 , it is possible to establish two restrictions for it .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ eq04:exp ] ) , along with the ball inequality , @xmath39 , impose an upper boundary , @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "second , in the @xmath15 limit , @xmath41 , leads to a lower boundary , @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "thus , a solution for @xmath5 must be such that the inequality , @xmath43 , should be always satisfied . in both cases ,",
    "the equality will hold for @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , this condition is satisfied at @xmath44 , when both mf and rg descriptions become equivalent ( see fig .",
    "* criteria for a consistent solution of @xmath5 .",
    "* ( a ) the behavior of @xmath45 as given by data , the boundaries @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as well as the mean - field model @xmath23 , reveal the non - trivial behavior of the solution for @xmath19 .",

    "( c ) @xmath48 as given by data and through eq .",
    "( [ eq12:mufinal ] ) are shown , as well as the approximation for @xmath37 valid at low dimensions ( dotted - line).,width=432 ]    under the previous considerations , we start the construction of the ansatz for @xmath30 by observing that when @xmath15 , all the information in @xmath49 regarding @xmath5 as @xmath34 is lost , as seen through @xmath50 , in fig .  2a . this information can be recovered by taking @xmath51 ( the limit - value of @xmath52 as @xmath15 ) starting from @xmath53 .",
    "this leads to ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 , is a continuous function of @xmath2 , and is expected to satisfy the previous considerations for @xmath30 at low dimensions . also , since both eqs .",
    "( [ eq07:muphi ] ) and ( [ eq09:muphi ] ) are equivalent , their respective ansatz should obey ,    @xmath56    therefore , a solution for @xmath57 guarantees a solution for @xmath30 as well . now , as @xmath34 , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq08:phi ] ) and ( [ eq10:phiequivalence ] ) , we have that @xmath58 . then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq09:muphi ] ) , we have that @xmath59 .",
    "this form for @xmath60 , along with eq .",
    "( [ eq02:rg ] ) , suggest that @xmath1 can be approximated as , @xmath61 , which for @xmath4 , gives @xmath62 , as previously found by other method @xcite .",
    "notice that what we have here is an approximation to the probability function itself given as @xmath63 , which is valid as @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "2c . therefore , based on these observations ,",
    "we propose ,    @xmath64    as our ansatz to the problem . as it can observed , this expression for @xmath57 yields a great agreement to the data and complies with all the necessary conditions for it to be a unique and consistent solution to the problem .",
    "when plugged back into eq .",

    "2c . by substituting back eq .",
    "( [ eq11:ansatz ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq10:phiequivalence ] ) , it provides the expected behavior for @xmath30 , fig .",
    "also , the solution for @xmath49 can then be substituted back into eq .",
    "( [ eq02:rg ] ) to obtain a continuous analytical function for @xmath5 , that at the same time , from eq .",
    "( [ eq06:lambda ] ) , provides the solution for @xmath19 itself , this is ,    @xmath67,\\ ] ]    that satisfies the restrictions imposed by the theory , including @xmath68 , for all @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "in particular , this solution gives @xmath0 for @xmath4 , in good agreement with the scaling of dla in two and also , higher dimensions ( fig .  1 and table i ) .",
    "furthermore , as previously stated , this expression for @xmath19 allows for both mf , eq .",
    "( [ eq04:exp ] ) , and extended rg descriptions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq02:rg ] ) and ( [ eq12:mufinal ] ) , to become nicely and consistently equivalent .",
    "finally , it must be pointed out that , since eq .",
    "( [ eq02:rg ] ) is in fact the turkevich - scher relation @xcite , that relates the @xmath5 of the structure with the scaling of its harmonic measure , @xmath69 , as @xmath70 , the solution derived here for @xmath5 , given by the extended eqs .",
    "( [ eq02:rg ] ) or ( [ eq04:exp ] ) , also provides the solution to the scaling of its harmonic measure .",
    "even more , from eq .",
    "( [ eq04:exp ] ) , we can see that , @xmath71 , where @xmath20 .",
    "then , @xmath72 $ ] remarkably satisfies @xmath73 .",
    "hence , this differential equation clearly shows that @xmath74 , through the weighted spatial correction function , @xmath24 , governs the spatial symmetry - breaking of the diffusion - limited growth process .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "based on well established mf and rg results for the fractal dimension of dla , we provide a solution to a long standing problem in fractal growth research , this is , the derivation of the first analytical expression for the fractal dimension of dla in the continuous - space or off - lattice model .",
    "this mf+rg description for @xmath5 is valid in the original two - dimensional version of the problem and satisfies the most rigorous conditions to have a consistent scaling for higher dimensions as well .",
    "furthermore , it provides the necessary corrections to make both , mf and rg descriptions consistently equivalent .",
    "finally , it provides a complete solution to the scaling of the harmonic measure , @xmath69 , while confirming its importance in defining the self - similar features of the dla structures .",
