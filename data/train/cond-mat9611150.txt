    "the fullerenes ( c@xmath1 , c@xmath3 , ... ) have attracted much interest since their discovery by kroto _",
    "et al . _ ( 1985 ) , not least because of their appealing , symmetric shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "this interest increased dramatically when krtschmer _",
    "( 1990 ) discovered how to produce c@xmath1 in large enough quantities to be able to make solids of a size which allowed traditional solid state experiments .",
    "very soon haddon _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) found that intercalation of alkali metal atoms in solid c@xmath1 leads to metallic behavior .",
    "shortly afterwards it was found that some of these alkali - doped c@xmath1 compounds are superconducting with a transition temperature @xmath4 which is only surpassed by the cuprates ( hebard _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ; rosseinsky _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ; holczer _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991a ; tanigaki _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ; fleming _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ) .",
    "thus @xmath4 is 33 k for rbcs@xmath5c@xmath1 ( tanigaki _ et al _ , 1991 ) and for cs@xmath0c@xmath1 under pressure @xmath6 k has been reported ( palstra _ et al _ , 1995 ) .",
    "the great interest in the superconductivity of the alkali - doped c@xmath1 compounds is in particular due to these systems being a completely new class of superconductors , the large value of @xmath4 and the question whether or not such a large value of @xmath4 can be caused by the coupling to phonons alone .",
    "there has therefore been a great effort over the last five years to characterize and understand both the normal state and superconducting properties of fullerides .",
    "the present review deals only with c@xmath1 compounds , since no other superconducting fullerides are known at present .",
    "2 c@xmath1 is the most symmetric molecule in the sense that its point group ( icosahedral ) with 120 symmetry operations is the largest point group of the known molecules .",
    "it has the shape of a soccer ball .",
    "the 60 carbon atoms are all equivalent and form 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons .",
    "the c@xmath1 molecules condense to a solid of weakly bound molecules .",
    "while the shortest separation between two atoms on the same molecule is about 1.4  , the shortest separation between two atoms on different molecules is about 3.1  .",
    "the fullerites are therefore molecular solids , where many of the molecular properties essentially survive in the solid .",
    "the discrete levels of a free c@xmath1 molecule are only weakly broadened in the solid , leading to a set of essentially nonoverlapping bands with a width of about 1/2 ev as is illustrated in fig .",
    "the system therefore has two very different energy scales , the intramolecular ( @xmath7 ev ) and the intermolecular ( @xmath8 ev ) energy scales .",
    "for an undoped c@xmath1 solid , the @xmath9 band is full and the @xmath10 band is empty , and this system is therefore a band insulator .",
    "when solid c@xmath1 is doped by alkali atoms , the alkali atoms donate about one electron each to the @xmath10 band ( erwin and pederson , 1991 ; saito and oshiyama , 1991b ; martins and troullier , 1992 ; satpathy _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) . since the @xmath10 band can take six electrons , it is half - full for a@xmath0c@xmath1 ( a = k , rb ) , which is a metal ( haddon _ et al . _ , 1991 )",
    ". a@xmath11c@xmath1 is , however , an insulator ( murphy _ et al . _ , 1992 ; kiefl _ et al . _ , 1992 ; benning _ et al . _ , 1993 ) although the @xmath10 band is only partly filled and should be a metal according to band theory ( erwin , 1993 ; erwin and bruder , 1994 ) .",
    "a@xmath12c@xmath1 is a band insulator .",
    "recently , ac@xmath1 has attracted much interest because of its rich and interesting phase diagram and because of its possibly quasi - one dimensional character ( stephens _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ; chauvet _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 , erwin _ et al . _ , 1995 ) .",
    "tdae - c@xmath1 has a ferromagnetic - like transition at @xmath13 k ( allemand _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ) .",
    "if the fullerides are considered as organic compounds , they have the highest superconducting and ( ferro)magnetic transition temperatures for organic compounds .    in a@xmath0c@xmath1 ( a = k , rb )",
    "the c@xmath1 molecules are located on a fcc lattice . at low temperatures ,",
    "the c@xmath1 molecules take one of two likely orientations in an essentially random way ( stephens _ et al . _ ,",
    "this orientational disorder has a substantial effect on some of the electronic properties ( gelfand and lu , 1992ab ; 1993 ; mele and erwin , 1994 ) , but has been neglected in most calculations .",
    "a certain short - range correlation of the orientations is expected on theoretical grounds ( gunnarsson _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ; mazin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993a , erwin and mele , 1994 ) and has been observed experimentally ( teslic _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) .",
    "the alkali atoms are located in the tetrahedral and octahedral holes . in rb nmr of rb@xmath0c@xmath1",
    "one would then expect to observe two lines . at low temperatures , however ,",
    "three lines are seen ( walstedt _ et al . _ , 1993",
    "; zimmer _ et al . _ , 1993 ) , raising some questions about our understanding of the precise structure .",
    "the effective coulomb interaction between two electrons on a c@xmath1 molecule in a solid is about 1 - 1@xmath14 ev ( lof _ et al . _ , 1992 ; brhwiler _ et al . _ , 1992 ; pederson and quong , 1992 ; antropov _ et al . _ , 1992 ) .",
    "the long - ranged coulomb interaction in the a@xmath0c@xmath1 compounds leads to a charge carrier plasmon , due to the oscillations of the @xmath10 electrons .",
    "this plasmon has the energy @xmath15 ev , an intermediate coupling constant @xmath16 ( antropov _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993b ; knupfer _",
    "et al . _ , 1993 ) and unusal dispersion ( gunnarsson _ et al . _ , 1996 ) and broadening ( liechtenstein _ et al . _ , 1996 ) .    in systems where the superconductivity is driven by the electron - phonon interaction , the transition temperature @xmath4 can be calculated in the eliashberg ( 1960 ) theory .",
    "a simple estimate of @xmath4 can be obtained from the mcmillan ( 1968 ) formula @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a typical phonon frequency ( logarithmic average ) , @xmath19 is the electron - phonon coupling , and @xmath2 is the coulomb pseudopotential , which describes the effects of the repulsive coulomb interaction . to estimate @xmath4",
    "we then in particular need to consider @xmath19 and @xmath2 .",
    "c@xmath1 has intramolecular vibrations ( phonons ) with energies up to @xmath20 ev . only phonons with a@xmath21 or h@xmath21 symmetry couple to the @xmath10 electrons .",
    "it was very early proposed that these phonons drive the superconductivity ( varma _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ; schluter _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992ab ; mazin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) .",
    "estimates of the electron - phonon interaction @xmath22 fall in the right range to explain the experimental values of @xmath4 .",
    "it has therefore become widely , but not universally , accepted that the intramolecular h@xmath21 phonons drive the superconductivity .",
    "other phonon modes , such as librations , c@xmath1-c@xmath1 and alkali - c@xmath1 vibrations are believed to play a small role for the superconductivity .",
    "it has , however , also been argued that an electronic mechanism may drive the superconductivity ( chakravarty _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ; baskaran and tosatti , 1991 ; friedberg _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) .",
    "the attractive interaction between two electrons induced by the electron - phonon interaction is small ( @xmath23 ev ) compared with the coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the same c@xmath1 molecule ( @xmath24 ev ) .",
    "nevertheless , for conventional superconductors it is argued that the effects of the coulomb interaction are drastically reduced by retardation effects , due to the very different energy scales for phonons and electrons .",
    "the dimensionless coulomb pseudopotential @xmath2 is therefore believed to be drastically renormalized for such systems .",
    "for doped c@xmath1 solids it has been controversial whether the intramolecular ( @xmath25 ) or intermolecular ( @xmath26 ) ( anderson , 1991 ) energy scale is relevant for the retardation effects . in the latter case",
    "one may expect the retardation effects to be small , since @xmath27 .",
    "it has therefore been asserted that the phonons alone can not explain the superconductivity in a@xmath0c@xmath1 ( anderson , 1991 ) .",
    "later work has provided support for the intermolecular energy scale being the relevant one , but nevertheless found that the electron - phonon mechanism may be sufficient if the coulomb interaction is screened as efficiently as predicted by rpa ( gunnarsson and zwicknagl , 1992 ) .    in the a@xmath0c@xmath1 ( a = k , rb ) compounds many energy scales are similar @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the jahn - teller energy of c@xmath30 , which may be of the order of several tenths of an ev .",
    "furthermore , certain coupling constants are intermediate ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath16 ) .",
    "this is a situation where we may expect particularly interesting physics , but also a situation which is particularly difficult to treat theoretically .",
    "@xmath32 suggests very strong correlation effects ( lof _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) , which have , however , not been considered in most treatment of fullerides .",
    "the similar magnitude of @xmath33 and @xmath26 raises doubt about the strength of the retardation effects , as discussed above , and it implies that migdal s theorem is not valid .",
    "corrections to migdal s theorem have been considered in a few cases ( see , e.g. , pietronero _ al . _ , 1995 ,",
    "takada 1993 ) .",
    "jahn - teller - like effects , beyond what is included in the migdal theory , may also play a role ( auerbach _ et al . _ , 1994 ; manani _ et al . _ ,",
    "the fact that @xmath29 may not be much smaller than @xmath26 could also be important for the insulating character of a@xmath11c@xmath1 ( fabrizio and tosatti , 1996 ) . in view of this , it is not surprising that many of the normal state properties are unusual ( see , e.g. , sawatzky ( 1995 ) ) and several interesting , unresolved questions remain .",

    "( ae = alkaline earth , re = rare earth ) [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tablev ]    because of the very efficient metallic screening of the intraband matrix elements , at least within rpa , these matrix elements are smaller than the largest interband matrix elements .",
    "these results depend crucially on the fact that these matrix elements have very different character ( monopole versus multipole interaction ) .",
    "this behavior is also very different from the electron gas , since there is an abrupt change in character when going from one subband to another , even if they are close in energy , due to the fact that each subband is derived from a different molecular level with a different spatial character . since eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.2 ] ) is derived assuming that all matrix elements are equal , it can not be used here .",
    "approximate summing of the ladder diagrams , using the calculated matrix elements , shows that @xmath2 is close to zero in this formalism ( gunnarsson and zwicknagl , 1992 ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask why the intraband matrix elements are so small .",
    "the screened interaction can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath26 is a matrix representing the different coulomb matrix elements , @xmath35 is the corresponding unscreened matrix elements and @xmath36 is the polarizability , which is here calculated in the rpa . for the intraband matrix elements ,",
    "the @xmath10 orbitals dominate the screening , and we can transform to the corresponding basis , neglecting all other orbitals . for small @xmath37 , the diagonal elements of @xmath36",
    "are then related to the density of states @xmath38 per spin .",
    "since both @xmath38 and the diagonal elements of @xmath35 are large , we can assume that the product is much larger than unity . essentially , the two factors @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.6 ] ) then drop out , and with appropriate assumptions one can then derive ( gunnarsson _ et al . _ , 1992 ) that the intraband matrix elements are @xmath39 for small @xmath37 . to obtain the unrenormalized @xmath40 we multiply by @xmath38 obtaining @xmath41 .",
    "averaging over @xmath42 gives @xmath43 .",
    "we note that @xmath26 becomes very small in the rpa for large @xmath38 , since in the rpa the cost of screening is purely a kinetic energy cost , and for a large @xmath38 this cost is very small . for large values of @xmath44",
    ", we expect rpa to become a poor approximation , and it is therefore an interesting and important question how accurate rpa is in this case .",
    "the considerations above were all within a framework where ladder diagrams in the screened interaction are summed .",
    "this raises the question about the validity of neglecting other diagrams .",
    "for instance , grabowski and sham ( 1984 ) studied the lowest order vertex corrections for the electron gas and found important corrections .",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) constructed other sets of diagrams , which to a large extent cancelled the ladder diagrams .",
    "this raises important questions about which diagrams to include .    to circumvent this problem , gunnarsson and zwicknagl ( 1992 ) and gunnarsson _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) studied a two - band model where some exact results can be obtained .",
    "thus they considered the hamiltonian @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a site index , @xmath47 the energies of the two levels , @xmath48 is the hopping integral , @xmath49 is the intraband interaction and @xmath50 is the interband scattering .",
    "the particularly strong interband scattering between the @xmath10 and @xmath51 bands in c@xmath1 is of a similar type , namely the excitation of two electrons between two bands ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it was then assumed that @xmath52 in this limit , the upper subband can be projected out and a new effective hamiltonian be obtained , which describes low - energy properties correctly .",
    "this process does not generate any new terms for the hamiltonian ( [ eq:4.8 ] ) , but it renormalizes the intraband interaction to @xmath53 if it is now assumed that @xmath54 , the renormalization of the intraband interaction is small .",
    "the properties of this effective hamiltonian then differ very little from the one - band model , where the upper band was completely neglected .",
    "thus the upper band has a small influence on the low energy properties in general and @xmath2 in particular .",
    "for instance , in rpa the screened interaction is @xmath55 in both the one - band and two - band models , if @xmath56 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ladder diagrams in the screened interaction due to scattering into the upper subband can be summed . if it is assumed that @xmath57 this approach predicts a large renormalization of @xmath2 .",
    "the ladder diagrams subtract a quantity @xmath58 , which , although small compared with @xmath49 , is large compared with the screened interaction in the limit considered .",
    "thus the summation of ladder diagrams leads to a qualitatively incorrect result in this case .",
    "the projection method and the summation of ladder diagrams describe similar physics .",
    "the difference is that in the rigorous projection method , the high energy degrees of freedom were eliminated first , while in the ladder diagram approach the low energy degrees of freedom were treated first ( by introducing the metallic screening ) and the high energy degrees of freedom later ( by summing the ladder diagrams ) .",
    "these results should be of relevance for the retardation effects due to the high - lying states also for conventional superconductors .",
    "the model above contains important features of a@xmath0c@xmath1 and the assumptions are not too unrealistic for this system .",
    "the results therefore suggest that the summation of ladder diagrams in the screened interaction gives unreliable results for a@xmath0c@xmath1 and that the renormalization of @xmath2 due to the higher subbands may not be large . for simplicity",
    "one may therefore assume that this renormalization can be neglected completely .",
    "if in addition rpa screening is used , one arrives at @xmath59 .",
    "the approach above has only addressed the renormalization due to the higher subbands but not due to processes within the @xmath10 band itself .",
    "if we assume that the traditional theory is valid for these processes , @xmath2 is renormalized to 0.3 according to formula ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) , if we set @xmath60 ev and @xmath61 ev .",
    "such a value is then to be used in the mcmillan formula , while the value 0.4 applies to the eliashberg equation including one subband .",
    "we notice that only static screening was considered above , although inclusion of dynamic effects may influence the results substantially ( rietschel and sham , 1983 ) .",
    "a very interesting work was performed by takada ( 1993 ) .",
    "he considered a model including electrons in the @xmath10 band , phonons and plasmons , where the plasmons screened the strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "guided by the ward ( 1950 ) identity and work by nambu ( 1960 ) , takada used an approximate vertex correction . in this way he was able to include corrections to migdal s theorem , vertex corrections to the electron - electron scattering in the @xmath10 band and the dynamical screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "it was found that the corrections to migdal s theorem enhanced the value of @xmath4 for moderate values of the phonon frequency .",
    "furthermore it was found that the vertex corrections to the electron - electron scattering reduce @xmath4 .",
    "thus there is a partial cancelation of the enhancement ( rietschel and sham , 1983 ) of @xmath4 due to dynamic screening effects , as had also been found earlier ( grabowski and sham , 1984 ) .",
    "takada used the value @xmath62 for the coulomb pseudopotential derived above , to describe static screening effects and the renormalization due to scattering in other sub bands than the @xmath10 band . using @xmath63 and adjusting the electron - plasmon coupling , takada ( 1993 )",
    "could then reproduce the experimental @xmath4 for k@xmath0c@xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding isotope effect @xmath64 for k@xmath0c@xmath1 was , however , surprisingly small . to describe the lattice parameter dependence of @xmath4 , takada had to assume that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath26 are the band widths of k@xmath0c@xmath1 and the system studied , respectively .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since in rpa @xmath40 is predicted to be essentially independent of the lattice parameter .",
    "chakravarty and kivelson ( 1991 ) , chakravarty _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1991 ) and baskaran and tosatti ( 1991 ) proposed that there may be an effective attractive interaction between the electrons for a c@xmath1 molecule of a purely electronic origin .",
    "chakravarty and kivelson ( 1991 ) introduced a hubbard model of the @xmath67-electron system in a free molecule with an on - site interaction @xmath68 , only . using second order perturbation theory",
    ", they calculated the energy of c@xmath1 , c@xmath69 and c@xmath70 .",
    "this provided an estimate of the effective repulsion for c@xmath71 .",
    "when the singlet state of c@xmath70 was considered , the result consisted of a positive , linear term and a negative , quadratic term in @xmath68 .",
    "the interaction therefore becomes attractive for sufficiently large @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the intramolecular hopping .",
    "the tendency to the formation of a singlet state results from an integral of the type @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.4 ] ) ) with @xmath75 belonging to the @xmath10 band ( lammert and rokhsar , 1993 ) , which may become negative when the higher states are projected out in second order perturbation theory .",
    "the following discussion has focussed on the validity of the second order perturbation theory and the neglect of a long - range coulomb interaction in this type of work .",
    "white _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1992 ) addressed the question about the validity of second order perturbation theory , by studying small model systems .",
    "in particular , they considered a model with twelve atoms located on a truncated tetrahedron . for this system",
    "exact diagonalization can be performed and compared with second order perturbation theory .",
    "white _ et al . _  ( 1992 ) concluded that second order perturbation theory is qualitatively correct for intermediate values of @xmath68 in the sense that exact diagonalization also gives an attractive interaction , but that second order perturbation theory may greatly overestimate the magnitude .",
    "auerbach and murthy ( 1992 ) and murthy and auerbach ( 1992 ) studied a model with electrons on a sphere and with an interaction of variable range .",
    "they calculated the second order contribution to pairing and they also estimated the third order terms .",
    "the second and third order contributions were found to be comparable at an interaction strength which was substantially smaller than the strength giving pairing in the second order calculation .",
    "this again raises doubts about the accuracy of the second order calculation .",
    "berdenis and murthy ( 1995 ) performed a renormalization group calculation for a hubbard model of c@xmath1 using a method of tokuyasu _ et al . _  ( 1993 ) .",
    "this method remains accurate up to larger values of the atomic @xmath68 than the second order perturbation theory , but its accuracy becomes questionable at roughly the value of @xmath68 where it predicts an attractive interaction .",
    "thus it seems to still be unclear whether or not the interaction can be attractive for an on - site hubbard model of a free c@xmath1 molecule .",
    "goff and phillips ( 1992 ; 1993 ) and auerbach and murthy ( 1992 ) have studied the effective interaction as a function of the range of the interaction .",
    "they found that the use of a more long - ranged interaction tended to suppress the formation of an attractive effective interaction . with an on - site interaction",
    ", two electrons added to the @xmath10 orbitals can almost avoid being on the same site simultaneously and they have only a weak direct interaction @xmath76 .",
    "it is then not entirely surprising that the renormalized interaction @xmath74 can lead to an effective attractive interaction .",
    "if the interaction becomes more long - ranged , the direct interaction rapidly increases , leading to a repulsive effective interaction . for the free molecule ,",
    "the interaction is long - range and there is actually an `` anti - screening '' effect for electrons on the opposite side of the molecule ( gunnarsson _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) .",
    "the reason is that for a finite system , screening charge can not be moved to infinity as for an infinite system .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that the effective interaction for the free molecule is large and repulsive , as discussed in sec .",
    "et al . _  ( 1991 ) therefore from the start pointed out that the attractive electronic mechanism could become operative only if the screening inside the molecule is much more efficient in the metal than in the free molecule .",
    "lammert _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1995 ) considered a model with a long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "it was argued that the molecules surrounding a specific molecule provide a metallic environment , which was approximated by a metal with a spherical cavity with the radius @xmath77 . in this way",
    "the corresponding degrees of freedom were integrated out first , although the metallic screening corresponds to a low energy scale in the problem ( @xmath78 ev ( knupfer _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) ) .",
    "the resulting screened interaction was calculated and used for the low - frequency interactions in the problem .",
    "the effective singlet two - body interaction was then calculated diagrammatically , including the the first and second order diagrams .",
    "an attractive interaction was obtained for @xmath77 in the range 5 - 6   and the on - site carbon @xmath68 in the range 8 - 10 ev .",
    "an alternative way of treating the problem within this spirit , is to express the metallically screened interaction @xmath79 in terms of the coulomb interaction @xmath80 between two electrons on a free c@xmath1 molecule .",
    "it is first assumed that in the solid the addition of a charge @xmath42 to a molecule induces a potential @xmath81 due to the metallic screening by the surrounding molecules , reducing @xmath80 to @xmath82 in the solid .",
    "we here assume that due to the small hopping between the c@xmath1 molecules , the surrounding molecules respond to a spherical symmetric average of the charge on the central molecule . in the model of lammert _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) , replacing the surrounding by a spherical cavity , @xmath83 . to obtain an estimate of @xmath84 ( or @xmath77 ) in the above spirit",
    ", one can treat the surrounding c@xmath1 molecules as grounded , metallic spheres with the radius 4.46   ( which reproduces the experimental molecular polarizability ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath85 ev ( krier and gunnarsson , 1995 ) , corresponding to @xmath86  , i.e. , too large to obtain an attractive interaction in the work of lammert _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) . if this is combined with the estimate of @xmath87 ev ( see sec .",
    "iva ) , a large and positive @xmath88 ev ( @xmath89 ) results .",

    "the intramolecular part @xmath122 can be expected to be essentially independent of the lattice parameter @xmath123 , while @xmath38 grows with @xmath123 .",

    "simple tight - binding calculations including 60 `` radial '' @xmath125-orbital per c@xmath1 molecule did , however , not give a very different @xmath123-dependence for the density of states for the two structures ( gunnarsson , 1993 ) .",
    "it has instead been suggested that na@xmath5kc@xmath1 and na@xmath5rbc@xmath1 may have structural distortions , and that these distortions possibly could reduce @xmath38 much more than the change in the lattice parameter ( maniwa , _ et al . _ , 1995 ) .",
