    "quantum bit ( qubit ) is a key block for building quantum computers . among various realizations of the qubit for quantum computations that based on the josephson junctions",
    "are considered to be particularly promising candidates because of their scalability , established fabrication techniques , and flexibility in designs .",
    "many kinds of the superconducting josephson - junction - qubit models are proposed in last years .",
    "they are josephson charge @xcite , flux @xcite , phase phase - qubit and hybridized @xcite qubits . according to divincenzo @xcite proposal ,",
    "the qubit for quantum computation must satisfy five criteria one of which is the low decoherence criterion .",
    "an approximate benchmark of the criterion is a fidelity loss no more than @xmath2 per elementary quantum gate operation .",
    "the decoherence of the josephson single qubit and coupling qubits has been investigated widely in last years @xcite . in these",
    "researches the dynamics of the qubits interacting with their environment has been treated by the perturbation method , the path integral method @xcite , and others @xcite . in the researches in general some approximation scheme must be used .",
    "the most familiar and frequently used one is the markov approximation @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed that the markov approximation can not be used in low temperature and for short cycle times of quantum computation @xcite . however",
    ", the qubits based on the josephson superconducting junction should be worked in low temperature , such as few 10 mk .",
    "so the markov approximation can not be used in the investigations of decoherence for josephson qubits .",
    "fortunately , a short - time approximation scheme short - time _ _  _ _ being _ _  _ _ fit for the investigations has been developed recently by privman _",
    "the approaches of v. privman and his co - worker are rather formal and universal .",
    "it is also very interesting to investigate the decoherence of a concrete and physical qubit model because it can help us to know that whether the model satisfy the divincenzo low decoherence criterion or not . if the model can not satisfy the criterion , the qubit has then not qualification for being a quantum computation hardware .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate that if the jcq model satisfy the divincenzo low decoherence criterion .",
    "the same problem has been investigated in our previous works @xcite where we suppose that there is only the ohmic noise in the environment of jcq .",
    "however , recent several experiments ( see @xcite and within ) with josephson junction circuits have revealed at low frequencies the presence of @xmath0 noise and it is shown that the @xmath0 noise plays a major role in destructing the coherence of qubit in solid - state systems . in this paper , we shall carefully estimate the decoherence of the jcq in ohmic and @xmath0 noise environment . here",
    ", the measure of decoherence is based on a standard operator norm @xmath3 in the theory of linear operators @xcite .",
    "the short - time approximation of the split - operator will be used in our investigation .",
    "the single jcq hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath4here , @xmath5 is the charging energy ; @xmath6 is the josephson coupling energy @xcite , where @xmath7 is the critical current of the josephson junction , @xmath8 the planck s constant divided @xmath9 and @xmath10 the charge of electron ; @xmath11 is the dimensionless gate charge , where @xmath12 is the gate capacitance , @xmath13 the controllable gate voltage . the number operator @xmath14 of ( excess ) cooper pair on the island , and the phase operator @xmath15 of the superconducting order parameter , are quantum mechanically conjugate @xcite .",
    "the unavoidable noise of the environment may lead to the dissipation .",
    "in general , one takes into account that the environment itself is also a quantum system with a large number degrees of freedom .",
    "usually it is modeled by a bath with a large set of harmonic oscillators @xcite@xmath16 , \\label{eq2}\\]]each of which interacts weakly with the system of interest .",
    "the whole hamiltonian of the system - bath is @xcite then @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\]]here , the coupling operator of the environment is @xmath18 if the josephson coupling energy @xmath19 is much smaller than the charging energy @xmath20 , and both of them are much smaller than the superconducting energy gap @xmath21 , the hamiltonian @xmath22 of josephson junction can be parameterized by the number of the cooper pairs @xmath14 on the island .",
    "when the temperature @xmath23 is low enough the system can be reduced to a two - state system ( qubit ) because all other charge states have much higher energy and can be neglected .",
    "so the hamiltonian of the system can approximately reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 if we choose the working point to make @xmath27 half - integer , say @xmath28 we can obtain that@xmath29here,@xmath30where@xmath31",
    "recent studies , both the experimental and theoretical , suggest that the serious noise sources in josephson devices include two kinds of fluctuations one of which with ohmic spectrum the other with @xmath0 spectrum 1/f - noise - jcq . in the following ,",
    "we introduce the spectral densities of the ohmic and @xmath0 noise . according to @xcite , from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we can express the spectral density of the noise as@xmath32where @xmath33 is the density of the states of environment modes . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral density is related to the power spectrum as @xcite@xmath34here , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "it has been stressed that the relationship ( [ eq8 ] ) are satisfied not only for the linear coupling model but also for the nonlinear one . to the ohmic noise case , from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem one",
    "has open - jcq - model @xmath37then , setting @xmath38 one has@xmath39so by using eq .",

    "@xcite this noise can be translated into the fluctuations of @xmath56 , namely,@xmath57where @xmath58 comparing the eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) we have @xmath59so@xmath60where @xmath61    in fact , in a jcq circuit these two kinds of noise are existed at the same time .",
    "so the spectral density of the total noise is@xmath62so we have @xmath63 in the following , we shall use above three kinds of different noise of the environment investigating the decoherence of the jcq .",
    "before studying the decoherence we shall investigate the dynamics of the open jcq with the short - time approximation . suppose the initial state of the jcq - bath be @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the initial state of jcq and @xmath66 is the initial state of the environment .",
    "we set @xmath66 is the product of the bath modes density matrices  @xmath67 . in the initial states , each bath mode @xmath68",
    "is assumed to be thermalized , namely,@xmath69where @xmath70 .",
    "the evolution operator of the jcq - bath is then@xmath71due to non - conservation of @xmath22 in this system , the evolution operator can not be in a general way expressed as @xmath72 but in the sort - time approximation , the operator can be approximately expressed as split - operator01,split - operator02@xmath73it has been proved that the expression is accurate enough for the time being short to the characteristic time . in the following",
    "we only investigate the case that the system evolute within the time @xmath74 ps , the characteristic time of the single jcq is @xmath75 ps ( when @xmath76 @xmath77ev ) @xcite .",
    "so the elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath78 in the basis of operator @xmath22 can be expressed as@xmath79where @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath82 is a matrix with @xmath83 by @xmath84 . in the following we set @xmath85 through some calculations",

    "prb67 - 094510 . from the deriving of @xmath95",
    "we know that it results from the choice of bath model and the coupling forms of jcq - bath rather than the choice of the approximation scheme .",
    "but the evolution of the matrix elements as eqs .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) is resulted from the short - time approximation and it can not be obtained by using the markov approximation and others . by using above results we can yield a good quantitative estimation to the decoherence behavior of jcq in a short time .",
    "it is shown that the measure @xmath96is suitable for estimating the decoherence of the qubit gates privman , fedichkin et al . here ,",

    "we plot the decoherence from ohmic noise of the jcq versus time @xmath116 .",
    "this decoherence is mainly derived from the higher frequency parts of the ohmic noise . here",
    ", we confine the frequencies of bath modes in @xmath81 ghz@xmath117 ghz this is a very broad band of frequencies of the environment noise . the lowest line in fig.1 plots the decoherence at temperature @xmath118 k. it is shown that when @xmath119 namely , @xmath120 s the decoherence is much smaller than divincenzo criterion @xmath121 .",
    "the middle and the upmost lines plot the decoherence at temperature @xmath122 k and @xmath123 k. from the plots we see that the decoherence will increase with the increasing of the temperature @xmath23 but it can not increase to the maximum value of the divincenzo criterion permitting at @xmath124 k within @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ps ) .",
    "fig.2 shows the decoherence from @xmath127 noise of the jcq in different @xmath128 it is shown that this decoherence mainly derived from the low frequency parts of the @xmath0 noise and it is sensitive to the changing of @xmath129 . in the calculations , we take the frequencies of the environment modes from @xmath81 khz to @xmath81 ghz the numerical simulation shows that the spectrum is broad enough@xmath47 in the fig.2 the lowest , middle , and upmost lines plot the decoherence at @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 a further calculation shows that if only @xmath133 the decoherence will affect the jcq as the qubit for making quantum computers because the decoherence is bigger than the divincenzo low decoherence criterion in the single operation time .",
    "so we should decrease the @xmath134 in order to make jcq be a qubit for quantum computation . in fig.3",
    "we simulate three kinds of cases where both the ohmic and @xmath0 noise are considered . here",

    "it is shown that when the @xmath129 do not exceed @xmath141 , within @xmath75 ps the decoherence from the ohmic noise and @xmath0 noise is endurable .",
    "in this paper we investigated the short - time decoherence results from the ohmic and @xmath0 noise of the jcq .",
    "it is shown that the decoherence from @xmath0 noise is larger than that from ohmic noise to the jcq model . to the ohmic noise",
    "the higher frequency parts play a major role to the decoherence .",
    "we take a larger range of the frequencies of the environment modes in our numerical simulation than usually proposed .",
    "it is shown that in usually experimental temperature this decoherence is not serious comparing to the divincenzo criterion . unlike the ohmic noise case , to the @xmath0 noise the decoherence is mainly determined by the lower frequency parts .",
    "it is shown that when @xmath142 within @xmath75 ps this decoherence is also not serious according to the divincenzo criterion .",
    "however , the present experiments show that the value of @xmath129 is between @xmath143 and @xmath144 thus , if we wish to make the jcq become a optimal qubit model we should decrease the value of @xmath129 .",
    "the value of @xmath129 is related to the temperature .",
    "it may decrease with the decreasing of temperature . carefully finding out the correlation of the value of @xmath129 and other parameters ( include the temperature )",
    "is a important task for our investigating the decoherence of jcq model in the future .",
