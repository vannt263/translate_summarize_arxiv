    "we identify a superstructure of periodicity @xmath27  nm . all the @xmath12 islands observed show such superstructures , however with various periodicities in the nm range . we interpret them as moir patterns that arise from the composition of the graphene and the reconstruction lattices stacked with rotation .",
    "the geometrical proof of this interpretation , based on the measured relation between the moir periodicity and the graphene / substrate rotation angle , is given in the supplementary information and is analogous to the one we applied in @xcite to @xmath11 islands .",
    "thus , the moir pattern ( periodicity @xmath27  nm , stacking angle @xmath28 ) is visible on both the adatom and the graphene lattice ( pseudocell in solid line ) . on the adatom sites",

    "the graphene perturbations consist in a ldos deficit on graphene atoms ( `` switched off '' atoms ) distributed with a periodicity similar to the one of the underlying reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "we recall that , from a geometrical point of view , the moir pattern is associated to the quasi periodicity of the graphene / reconstruction stacking .",
    "hence , the perturbations observed on both the adatom and graphene lattice being correlated to the moir pattern , the graphene substrate / interaction should vary with the local stacking . to further study the stacking dependence of the graphene / adatom interaction",

    "the series of high positive bias images showing the adatom states ( figures [ fig3 ] ( c - e ) ) exhibits two inversions in the moir pattern contrast between @xmath37  v and @xmath38  v. this behavior indicates that the moir pattern is related to a spatial modulation of the adatom ldos rather than to a topographic modulation .",

    "this differentiation is unlikely to arise from the type of graphene sublattice impacted since they are equivalent in ldos in ideal graphene .",
    "a schematic representation of the graphene / reconstruction stacking given in figure [ fig3 ] ( f ) helps to find an explanation to this observation .",
    "both halves of the pseudocell show top graphene / adatom stacking at their center , the difference between them lies in the graphene / restatom stacking .",
    "the upper ( lower ) half shows a top ( hollow ) graphene / restatom stacking .",
    "a weak graphene / restatom interaction could thus explain the differentiation between the two halves of the moir pseudocell .",
    "this assumption is further supported by the differentiation of the restatoms in correlation to the moir pattern revealed by the stm image at @xmath40  v ( filled states ) in figure [ fig3 ] ( g ) .",

    "we focus on the much stronger graphene / adatom interaction and complement data from figure [ fig3 ] with scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements .",

    "this lower - energy contrast inversion could however be interpreted as arising from a stacking dependent resonance broadening along with the stacking dependent shift in energy .",

    "an explanation to this comes from the fact that each spectrum is acquired at a fixed tip - surface distance which is determined by the stabilization parameters @xmath13 while during constant current imaging , the tip - sample distance is adjusted in order to keep the tunneling current fixed .",
    "as one can infer from the dramatic current drop with @xmath24 in figure [ fig4 ] ( c ) , during the acquisition of the spectra presented in figure [ fig4 ] , the tip - surface distance was relatively high with respect to the one during a constant current image at ( @xmath57  v , @xmath58  na ) presented in figure [ fig3 ] ( c ) .",
    "@xmath59 curves on this surface actually indicate that the tip moves toward the surface by @xmath60   between @xmath61  v and @xmath37  v ( see epaps ) .",
    "thus , low bias states are hardly probed in the cits measurements of figure [ fig4 ] .    in the following section",
    ", we will use a simple theoretical model in order to check if a stacking dependent graphene / adatom interaction can indeed lead to variations in the shifting and broadening of the adatom level .      in this section ,",
    "we follow the calculation procedure presented in @xcite and apply anderson s description of a localized state in the continuum  @xcite to our system i.e. graphene on top of an adatom in the top and hollow stacking configuration ( see figure [ fig5 ] ( a ) ) . in this framework , we model the adatom as an isolated localized state of energy @xmath62 and thus neglect the presumably low interaction between adatoms because of the large adatom - adatom distance -@xmath21 - as well as the small impact of the restatoms located further away from the graphene layer .",

    "the inset graph shows that the ratio @xmath125 / im[\\sigma^h(\\omega)]$ ] diverges at low energy for all considered values of @xmath90 .",
    "hence , we expect that our model accounts for the larger residual dos for the top adatom than for the hollow adatom at sufficiently low energy .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] ( e ) finally shows the density of states associated to the adatom for both configurations , with @xmath126  ev and @xmath127 .",
    "these values have been obtained by solving equation [ eq::resigma ] for the hollow and top configurations with @xmath128  ev and @xmath129  ev in order to fit the experiment ( see figure [ fig4](d ) ) .",
    "the insert displays the calculated dos at low energy . in this energy range ,",
    "the dos is very low with respect to the vicinity of the resonance , which is consistent with the typical evolution of the tip - surface distance as a function of tunneling bias reported in figure s2 . when considering the dos ratio , we find that the dos on the top adatom clearly dominates the one on the hollow adatom ( at @xmath130  ev , @xmath131 )  @xcite .",
    "thus , three different energy domains emerge , successively where the dos of the top adatom dominates ( @xmath132  ev in this case ) , then the dos from the hollow adatom gains the upper hand ( @xmath133  ev@xmath134  ev ) and again the dos from the top adatom dominates ( @xmath135  ev ) .",
    "this result is thus consistent with the experimental measurements presented in figure [ fig3 ] showing two moir contrast inversions . in the end , with reasonable values for @xmath90 , @xmath110 and @xmath62 , the simple model we used accounts for the variations in level energy and broadening for the two different graphene / adatom stacking configurations expected from the experiments .    to finish , note that by comparing the calculated ldos to the experimental conductance spectra , we neglect the energy - dependence of the tunnel barrier transmission coefficient @xmath44 whose effect is to favor tunneling to higher energy empty states i.e. close to the resonances .",
    "also , we assume a weak coupling to the tip states .",
    "moreover , we do not take into account the fano - resonance effect that can arise from interference between tunneling paths connecting the tip and graphene and the tip and the localized state  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we expect no such effect here because graphene on sic is electronically transparent on high bias stm images  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the stm constant current images of figure [ fig3 ] do not show the graphene atomic contrast for tunneling biases down to @xmath37  ev while the adatom states are clearly identified .",
    "in other words , at high tunneling bias , direct tunneling from the tip states to the adatom states is highly favored with respect to tunneling from the tip states to the graphene states even though the adatoms lay below the graphene plane .      in this section",
    ", we study the graphene - adatom interaction using ab initio calculations that take into account the complete graphene - sic@xmath5 system .",
    "a detailed description of the calculation was published in  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the energy range that corresponds to the graphene - adatom interaction .",
    "due to technical constraints on the calculation supercell size , we chose the quasi - commensurate @xmath136 graphene on top of a @xmath137 sic cell . in order to examine various graphene / adatom stacking ,",
    "we consider two supercells which correspond to translations of the graphene lattice with respect to the substrate , as shown in figure [ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "with respect to the graphene lattice , the a4 adatom sits in a top configuration , the a1 - 3 adatoms in a sligthly shifted top configuration , the b4 adatom in a hollow configuration and the b1 - 3 adatoms in a bridge configuration .",
    "the supercells we consider correspond to two specific geometries , each one giving rise to a small moir pattern .",
    "it is different from the geometry probed by stm which gives rise to a large moir pattern that contains all the graphene - adatom stacking configurations listed above within one pseudocell .",
    "we thus use our calculations to study the graphene - adatom interaction rather than as a model of the system probed experimentally .",
    "moreover , we have to keep in mind that our gga calculations of the graphene - sic@xmath5 may have some imperfections arising from the possible underestimation of the graphene - reconstruction interaction  @xcite , which however are not critical for the purpose of this study .",
    "consequences of this are the following .",
    "firstly , we can not discuss the graphene - restatom interaction since our calculations do not give account for this small coupling  @xcite .",
    "the lda and gga(d ) calculations from the literature show a band anticrossing of @xmath138  mev  @xcite and we have shown experimentally that the graphene - restatom interaction indeed exists in the discussion in connection with figure [ fig3 ] . however , we chose to concentrate on the much stronger graphene - adatom interaction , which we can discuss with our gga calculations . secondly",
    ", we obtain a neutral graphene layer  @xcite while angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite and calculations cited above  @xcite indicate electron doping of the graphene sheet so that @xmath139  ev and @xmath140  ev respectively . thus , our calculations may not reproduce the position of @xmath26 in this system . finally , we obtain a flatter graphene layer ( @xmath141    @xcite ) than calculations  @xcite from the literature which show a small corrugation of @xmath142    using lda and @xmath143    using gga(d ) .",
    "we will discuss the consequences of this later in this section .",
    "the calculated band structure for each configuration is given in figure [ fig6 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "in both cases , it exhibits a clear band anticrossing between the 4 weakly dispersive adatom bands and the graphene @xmath144 band , evidencing interaction between graphene and adatom states .",
    "note that far from the adatom states , near the dirac point , our calculations in the same system showed that the linearity of the @xmath4 bands is recovered  @xcite , which is also the case for gga(d ) and lda calculations  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) ab initio electronic structure calculations of graphene on sic@xmath145 .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) top view of the two considered supercells , displaying top ( a4 ) , slightly shifted top ( a1 - 3 ) , bridge ( b1 - 3 ) and hollow ( b4 ) graphene / adatom stacking configurations .",

    "( c ) and ( d ) respective band structure calculations in the energy range spanning the adatom low - dispersive bands .",
    "( e ) calculated ldos for the a3 - 4 and b3 - 4 adatoms .",
    "( f ) , ( g ) maps of @xmath146 integrated over the energy range @xmath147  ev@xmath148  ev@xmath149 $ ] taken just above the graphene atoms , for the configurations given in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "contrast is reversed with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( d ) and [ fig3 ] ( b ) : higher density is darker .",
    "the adatom positions are indicated by dashed circles.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ fig6 ] ( e ) gives the calculated adatom ldos for each type of stacking .",
    "features displayed by figure [ fig6 ] ( e ) are complex but the simple model introduced in the previous section will help analyze them . by comparing the two extreme situations , top stacking ( red ) and hollow stacking ( black ) , we find a lower position in energy of the spectral weight for the hollow than for the top configuration . regarding the broadening of the adatom band , we find a larger extension in energy in case of the top configuration .",
    "hence , we find the same trends in the impact of the graphene / adatom interaction on the adatom level as with the anderson single - impurity model .    considering intermediate configurations which we did not treat with the previous model",
    ", the slightly shifted top position leads to a ldos very similar to the one for the exact top configuration , in energy and band broadening .",
    "such behavior proves that the graphene / adatom interaction is not strictly local .",
    "the bridge configuration leads to an average band energy position similar to the the one for the top configuration but with a slightly narrower distribution .",
    "going more into details , the fine structure of the ab initio calculated ldos may arise from various factors that were not taken into account in the previous model .",
    "indeed , in this system we consider an adatom array on a semi - infinite medium , while in the previous section the impurity was isolated .",
    "the weak direct adatom / adatom interaction can slightly affect the results .",
    "moreover , each adatom interacts with graphene which is in interaction with the other adatoms . in the end",
    "this can result in the multiplication of the peaks in the adatom ldos by supercell ( periodicity ) effects .",
    "since the multiplication of the peaks is governed by the calculation geometry , which is different from the one in the experimentally probed system , we can not reasonably extract any general information from the fine structure of the calculated ldos spectra .",
    "moreover , stm measurements were conducted at room temperature , which implies a @xmath150  mev broadening in energy of the ldos features .",
    "for instance , the ldos crossing at @xmath151  ev in [ fig6 ] ( e ) is unlikely to appear as a contrast inversion in our stm measurements .    finally , figures [ fig6 ] ( f - g ) show maps of @xmath146 integrated over the energy range @xmath147  ev@xmath148  ev@xmath149 $ ] , taken just above the graphene atoms , for the configurations given in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we chose the energy range where figures [ fig6 ] ( c - d ) show a clear hybridization between the graphene and adatom states , in order to reveal the impact of the graphene - adatom interaction on the graphene electronic structure in the direct space and compare it to stm data .",
    "note however that the integration energy range in the ab initio calculated maps is different than the one on low bias stm images .",
    "firstly , it is difficult to compare the very low integrated dos calculated for lower energy with respect to the dirac point to stm data .",
    "secondly , we recall that in the experimental system , the position of @xmath26 is most likely shifted toward higher energy with respect to the gga calculation",
    ".    figures [ fig6 ] ( f - g ) show ldos reduction on the graphene atom atop of the adatom ( figure [ fig6 ] ( f ) ) and equivalent ldos on the 6 neighboring graphene atoms in the hollow configuration ( figure [ fig6 ] ( g ) ) .",
    "we thus find the same kind of features we identified on low bias stm images ( figure [ fig2 ] ( d ) and [ fig3 ] ( b ) ) . going more into details , on the low bias stm images , the dark contrast not only corresponds to top , but also to side top and to bridge sites of the si adatoms .",
    "the shape and apparent depth of the `` switched off '' atoms depends on the local stacking .",
    "only for nearly exact hollow site configuration does the perturbation disappear .",
    "first , this is consistent with the fact that the graphene - adatom interaction has a large spatial extension and thus we consider @xmath152 in the anderson model .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that adatoms in top , side top and bridge configurations are similarly impacted , as indicated by our ab initio study of the adatom ldos ( figure [ fig6 ] ( e ) ) .",
    "moreover , we recall that in the anderson model , it is only when the very specific hollow configuration is reached that the interference between the hopping paths ( at low energy ) arises , and that the graphene - adatom states hybridization is subsequently strongly reduced .    to finish , we pointed out that our calculations possibly underestimate the graphene - reconstruction interaction and consequently underestimates the graphene corrugation .",
    "our results thus show that the extinction of the ldos on the graphene atom in top configuration is already present for a flat graphene layer . for a corrugated surface ,",
    "the top graphene atom is closer to the si adatom by less than @xmath153   according to our low bias measurements and ab initio calculations  @xcite .",
    "this translates in a larger value of @xmath110 in the anderson model i.e. an even larger graphene - adatom states hybridization . from the distance dependence of tight binding parameters ,",
    "@xmath110 should however increase by less than @xmath154% .",
    "we recall that stm constant current images represent both the topography and the electronic structure of the surface . in the end",
    ", we expect an enhanced contrast on low - bias stm images from the topographic lowering of the top graphene atoms .",
    "regarding the si adatom resonances , a @xmath154% larger @xmath110 in the top configuration reduces the hollow - top resonance energy difference - but not enough to invert their positions ( see figure [ fig5 ] ( c))- and further increases the top resonance `` broadening '' with respect to the hollow resonance ( see figure [ fig5 ] ( d ) ) .",
    "thus , taking the corrugation into account will not strongly modify the conclusions of this study .",
    "we have been able to investigate the graphene - impurity interaction as a function of the graphene - impurity local stacking .",
    "a direct experimental comparative study has been possible thanks to the specificities of graphene on sic@xmath5 .",
    "the substrate reconstruction is composed of one si adatom and one c restatom per unit cell , and is mainly interacting with graphene through the adatoms .",
    "it has a large cell parameter of @xmath21  , allowing us to consider the adatoms as independent in a first approximation .",
    "the graphene / adatom interaction is appreciable but not too strong so that the general electronic structure of graphene and the reconstruction are maintained .",
    "the rotation between the graphene and the reconstruction lattices imply spatial variations of the local graphene / adatom stacking , allowing us to compare different configurations on the same stm image .",
    "finally , the electronic transparency of graphene on sic on high bias stm images makes it possible to clearly identify the local stacking and to study both the impact of the interaction on the graphene ldos - low bias tunneling regime - and on the adatom level - high bias tunneling regime .",
    "low bias stm images show that the graphene ldos near the fermi level is clearly affected in the top - like graphene / adatom stacking regions , graphene atoms atop of an adatom showing strongly reduced ldos , while perturbations are hardly noticeable in hollow graphene / adatom stacking regions .",
    "regarding the adatom resonance , a combination of constant current stm images at various high tunneling biases and tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveals a lower resonance energy and smaller broadening in the hollow configuration than in the top configuration .",
    "the single - impurity anderson model gives consistent results with the experimental observations for the adatom resonances in the top and hollow configurations when the same interaction cut off for both configurations is considered . within this model ,",
    "the reduced impurity level broadening in the hollow configuration arises from interferences between hopping paths connecting the adatom site and the neighboring graphene atoms within each graphene sublattice .",
    "finally , we theoretically investigate the graphene - adatom interaction using ab initio calculations that take the whole graphene / reconstruction structure into account . considering the ldos on adatoms , from the more complex calculated electronic structure , we extract the same trends in the stacking - dependent impact of the interaction on the adatom level as with the simple anderson model and stm .    to conclude , our results confirm the importance of local stacking in the graphene - impurity problem .",
    "they show that it is possible to discriminate between two local stacking configurations by comparing the impurity level broadening and shifting .",
    "the local stacking can also be identified by considering the perturbations in the graphene ldos .",
