    "in earlier work  @xcite we addressed the question of whether quarks play an important role in finite nuclei .",
    "this involved quantitative investigations of the properties of closed - shell nuclei from @xmath4o to @xmath5pb  @xcite , as well as the effective mass of the @xmath6 meson formed in light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these calculations were performed within the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model , originally suggested by guichon  @xcite , and with an extended version  @xcite , which treats also the @xmath7 and @xmath6 meson mass variations self - consistently in the medium .    in the qmc model ,",
    "the interactions between hadrons are mediated by the exchange of scalar ( @xmath8 ) and vector ( @xmath7 and @xmath6 ) mesons self - consistently coupled to the quarks within those hadrons . within the model it has proven possible to successfully describe the properties of infinite nuclear matter  @xcite and also finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "blunden and miller  @xcite , and jin and jennings  @xcite have made similar studies based on the qmc model , and some phenomenological extensions .",
    "one of the most attractive features of the qmc model is that it does not involve much in the way of additional complications to quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it produces a reasonable value for the nuclear incompressibility  @xcite-@xcite .    here",
    "we apply the qmc model  @xcite to a systematic study of the properties of @xmath2 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "some of the initial results for @xmath2 hypernuclei were reported already  @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of the present article is to present the spin - orbit potentials for the hyperon calculated self - consistently with an explicit quark structure for the bound hyperon in the qmc model .",
    "these spin - orbit potentials generally contain anomalous contributions from the quarks due to the finite size of the hyperon .    within the born - oppenheimer approximation",
    ", one can derive equations of motion for a hypernucleus in the qmc model  @xcite in the same way as has been done for normal nuclei  @xcite .",
    "such an approach may provide us with important information about the hyperon - nucleon interaction , the deep nuclear interior and a possible manifestation of the quark degrees of freedom via the pauli principle at the quark level  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "below , we will briefly review the present situation regarding @xmath2 hypernuclei first , because they have been well studied , both experimentally and theoretically .    as an example , the very weak spin - orbit interaction for @xmath2 hypernuclei , which had been phenomenologically suggested by bouyssy and hfner  @xcite , was first explained by brockman and weise  @xcite in a relativistic hartree model , and directly confirmed later by experiment  @xcite .",
    "however , a very strong su(3 ) breaking effect was required to achieve this small spin - orbit force .",
    "an explanation in terms of quark and gluon dynamics was made by pirner  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , noble  @xcite showed that this small spin - orbit force could be also realized without any large breaking of su(3 ) symmetry , if an @xmath10 tensor coupling was introduced , analogous to the anomalous magnetic moment of the @xmath2 .",
    "however , dover and gal  @xcite questioned whether the tensor coupling of the @xmath7 meson to the @xmath2 could be related to the anomalous magnetic moment , because the spin of @xmath2 is entirely carried by the s quark in a naive su(6 ) valence quark model , and this s quark couples exclusively to the @xmath11 meson according to the ozi rule .",
    "later , jennings  @xcite pointed out that within dirac phenomenology the tensor coupling of the @xmath7 meson to the @xmath2 could be introduced in such a way as to guarantee that the direct @xmath7 coupling to the spin of the @xmath2 was zero  as one would expect from a simple quark model .",
    "the resulting spin - orbit force agrees with the result obtained in the present model  @xcite , on the basis of an explicit treatment of the quark structure of the @xmath2 moving in vector and scalar fields that vary in space .    as a second example",
    ", it has also been discovered that there is an overbinding problem in the light @xmath2 hypernuclei , and the existence of a repulsive core or the necessity of a repulsive three - body force have been suggested to overcome the problem  @xcite . the origin of this overbinding , which could not be explained easily in terms of traditional nuclear physics , was ascribed to the pauli principle at the quark level by hungerford and biedenharn  @xcite .",
    "investigations of this repulsive core in the @xmath2-nucleus system have been made by takeuchi and shimizu , and others  @xcite , based on a nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "in addition to the investigations of @xmath2 hypernuclei , many studies of @xmath9 and @xmath1 hypernuclei have been also made  @xcite,@xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , experiments on @xmath9 hypernuclei performed at cern  @xcite , brookhaven  @xcite and kek  @xcite , confirmed the existence of @xmath9 hypernuclei .",
    "the former two experiments were done using @xmath12 beams in so called @xmath13in - flight kinematics \" , while the latter was done using stopped kaons .",
    "these experiments revealed an interesting feature of @xmath9 hypernuclei , namely , the widths of the @xmath9 in a hypernucleus seems to be narrower than the naive expectations due to the strong @xmath3 conversion ( channel coupling ) .",
    "as for the @xmath1 hypernuclei , although not so many experiments on the double strangeness hypernuclei ( s@xmath14 ) have been performed so far  @xcite-@xcite , there is a renewed interest in connection with the h dibaryon suggested by jaffe  @xcite , based on quark degrees of freedom  using the mit bag model .",
    "thus , we expect that more experiments on the @xmath9 and @xmath1 hypernuclei , with higher statistics and precision , will be performed in the near future .    in the light of these investigations",
    ", it now seems appropriate to investigate the ( heavier ) hypernuclear systems , @xmath2 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 hypernuclei quantitatively , using a microscopic model based on quark degrees of freedom . for this purpose , the qmc model ( which is built explicitly on quark degrees of freedom ) seems ideally suited , because it has already been shown to describe the properties of finite nuclei quantitatively .",
    "the present investigation is one of the natural extensions of the study of quark degrees of freedom in finite nuclei .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , the relativistic formulation of the hypernuclear system in qmc will be explained .",
    "a mean - field lagrangian density and equations of motion will be derived in section 2.1 .",
    "hyperons in infinite nuclear matter will be discussed in section 2.2 , while ( finite ) hypernuclei will be treated in section 2.3 . in section 3 , the spin - orbit potential for the hyperon in the qmc model will be discussed . some results for hypernuclei in the qmc model alone",
    "will be given in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", modifications necessary for a more realistic calculation in addition to the present version of the qmc model will be discussed .",
    "effects of the pauli blocking at the quark level in the @xmath15 ( and @xmath16 ) coupled channel , will be considered in specific ways at the hadronic level in sections 5.1 , and 5.2 , respectively .",
    "the results with including these effects discussed in sections 5.1 and 5.2 will be given in section 5.3 .",
    "finally , section 6 will be devoted for summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we will derive mean - field equations of motion for a hypernucleus , as well as consider a hyperon in nuclear matter .      using the born - oppenheimer approximation",
    "one can derive mean - field equations of motion for a hypernucleus in which the quasi - particles moving in single - particle orbits are three - quark clusters with the quantum numbers of a hyperon or a nucleon .",
    "one can then construct a relativistic lagrangian density at the hadronic level  @xcite , similar to that obtained in qhd  @xcite , which produces the same equations of motion when expanded to the same order in velocity , @xmath17 : @xmath18 \\psi_n(\\vec{r } ) \\quad \\nn \\\\    & - & \\frac{1}{2 } [ ( \\nabla \\sigma(\\vec{r}))^2 + m_{\\sigma}^2 \\sigma(\\vec{r})^2 ] + \\frac{1}{2 } [ ( \\nabla \\omega(\\vec{r}))^2 + m_{\\omega}^2 \\omega(\\vec{r})^2 ] \\nn \\\\   & + & \\frac{1}{2 } [ ( \\nabla b(\\vec{r}))^2 + m_{\\rho}^2 b(\\vec{r})^2 ] + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla a(\\vec{r}))^2 , \\nn \\\\ { \\cal l}^y_{qmc } & = & \\sum_{y=\\lambda,\\sigma,\\xi } \\overline{\\psi}_y(\\vec{r } )   \\left [ i \\gamma \\cdot \\partial - m_y^{\\star}(\\sigma ) - ( \\ , g^y_\\omega \\omega(\\vec{r } )   + g^y_\\rho i^y_3 b(\\vec{r } )   + e q_y a(\\vec{r } ) \\ , ) \\gamma_0   \\right ] \\psi_y(\\vec{r } ) , \\qquad \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 are respectively the nucleon ( hyperon ) and the @xmath6 meson ( the time component in the third direction of isospin ) fields , while @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the masses of the @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 mesons . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the @xmath7-n and @xmath6-n coupling constants which are related to the corresponding ( u , d)-quark-@xmath7 , @xmath27 , and ( u , d)-quark-@xmath6 , @xmath28 , coupling constants as @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xcite .    in an approximation where the @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 mesons couple only to the u and d quarks ( ideal mixing of the @xmath7 and @xmath11 mesons , and the ozi rule are assumed ) , the coupling constants in the hyperon sector are obtained as @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the total number of valence u and d quarks in the hyperon y. @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the third component of the hyperon isospin operator and its electric charge in units of the proton charge , @xmath36 , respectively .",

    "note that the dependence of these coupling strengths on the applied scalar field must be calculated self - consistently within the quark model .",
