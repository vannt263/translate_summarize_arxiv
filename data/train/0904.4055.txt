    "mixtures of starch grains and water have attracted attention recently as model materials for studying drying and fracture patterns , and in particular the formation of columnar joints @xcite .",
    "when a starch - water slurry dries , it responds to desiccation in two distinct ways .",
    "initially , the evaporating slurry solidifies into a homogeneous starch - cake , which can be up to several cm thick , that dries uniformly throughout its thickness . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cracks](a ) , stresses that occur in this phase drive the formation of a thin - film fracture pattern , similar to the craqulere patterns seen in pottery glazes or dried mud puddles @xcite .",
    "further evaporation leads to a form of directional drying , as a desiccation front is initiated at the drying surface , and intrudes into the starch - cake @xcite .",
    "this type of drying is associated with the development of columnar joints @xcite , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ cracks](b ) .",
    "the resulting polygonal pattern is statistically identical to that found in columnar basalts , such as the giant s causeway @xcite , or fingal s cave , shown in fig .",
    "[ cracks](c ) .",
    "interestingly , the column size is also chosen by the same dimensionless scaling law in both cases @xcite .",
    "it remains mysterious , however , why drying starch slurries should form columnar joints at all .",
    "most other slurries or dispersions have only been seen to give rise to the more common craqulere patterns , when dried .    here",
    ", it is shown that the effective separation of the two very different drying mechanisms of liquid capillary flow and diffusive vapor transport is responsible for setting up the conditions of directional solidification that are necessary to produce columnar joints in a drying starch - cake . in the case of starch",
    ", this effective separation may arise from an unusually porous structure of the starch grains themselves .",
    "[ color online ] two types of cracks form in a drying starch - cake : ( a ) thin - film , or ` mud - crack ' patterns , and ( b ) columnar joints .",
    "the thin - film crack spacing scales with film thickness @xcite , and is typically a few cm .",
    "the columnar joint crack spacing scales with the evaporation rate @xcite , and is typically around a mm .",
    "( c ) columnar joints are common in cooled lava , where they appear to be governed by similar scaling and organizational behavior to starch columns.,width=324 ]    the stress state within a drying poroelastic solid is analogous to that of a cooling viscoelastic solid @xcite .",
    "this correspondence allows experimental results obtained from drying starch to be compared , quantitatively , with the thermal problem of columnar joint formation in lava @xcite .",
    "motivated by this well - known geophysical application , the dynamics of the columnar crack pattern have been studied experimentally in considerable detail @xcite .",
    "starch suspensions can also act as a conceptual bridge between colloids and soils , as the size of starch grains is intermediate between those of most soils , and those of common colloids .",
    "there has been interest in studying water transport in starch as a soil analog @xcite , and to assist in explaining desiccation cracks in fine arid soils @xcite .",
    "the system has also attracted attention as a model test of simulations of crack formation @xcite , as the ordered columnar joints are expected to arise spontaneously from the underlying dynamics .",
    "in addition to quantiatively addressing the physical origin of columnar joints in drying starch , it is hoped that the full description of drying and cracking of starch presented in this paper will encourage such physically based modeling , and foster the development of a common understanding of the formation of of thin - film fracture , desiccation cracks in soils , and columnar joints .",
    "the drying , and eventual fracture , of a slurry is a complex problem . a detailed understanding of the physical properties of the network of grains and pores is necessarily involved in any effort to model desiccation , and columnar jointing .",
    "investigations were first made into several physical properties of desiccating starch slurries , in order to characterize how water may be transported either as a liquid or vapor , within an unsaturated starch - cake .",
    "the results presented here are then used to develop and test a dynamical model of water transport , and of the microscopic origins of stresses , within a desiccating starch - cake , initially composed of equal masses of cornstarch and water .",
    "finally , this model is used to suggest why starches , unlike most other porous media , form columnar fracture patterns when they dry .",
    "for all experiments presented here , cornstarch ( sometimes known as cornflour ) slurries were prepared by mixing equal masses of dry cornstarch ( canada brand ) and water in a glass container .",
    "starch - cakes , up to 4 cm thick , were prepared by pouring the initial slurry into 60 mm radius flat - bottomed glass dishes , which were then placed under a pair of 250 w heat lamps , to dry .",
    "the materials and methods are identical to those reported in a number of studies of columnar jointing in starch @xcite .      the properties of granular porous media are strongly affected by the size and geometry of their consitiuent particles .",
    "using a laser - diffraction particle sizer ( malvern mastersizer s ) , the average particle radius of starch grains in water was found to be @xmath0 = 8.2@xmath10.1 @xmath2 m , with the peak characterized by a full - width - half - maximum of 3.2@xmath10.1 @xmath2 m .",
    "the starch grains do not swell when wetted  8 tests were performed , from immediately after mixing dry starch with water , to 15 minutes later , with no variation in size .",
    "3 additional tests of grain size were done in air .",
    "some clumping of grains in air was noticed , but the position of the main peak of the particle size distribution was not displaced from that measured in water .",
    "particle size results were confirmed by the direct observation of a dilute sediment of starch in water , through a digital microscope .",
    "electron microscopy was performed on a starch column selected from a fully dried columnar sample , and on dry starch grains dusted onto a sample holder .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ sem](a ) , starch grains appear to be randomly close packed . on close inspection , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sem](b ) , the grain surface is somewhat platy and broken up , and the grains are seen to contain many pits .",
    "when wetted these pits can potentially fill with water , which will need to be considered when estimating the porosity of any grain packing .",
    "the large surface area of the pits , and their small diameter , may also account for some of the strong hydrophilic qualities of corn starch .",
    "scanning electron microscope images of starch .",
    "( s ) starch observed on the surface of a columnar joint are randomly , and closely packed .",
    "( b ) the starch grains are roughly spherical , and display both a platy , broken surface , and a highly porous sub - structure .",
    "( c ) individual grain - grain contacts show deformation of the grains.,width=324 ]    if a starch suspension is allowed to dry and form columnar joints , the starch grains are damaged on the microscopic level .",
    "if a sample is re - wetted , mixed , and re - dried , the resulting columns are usually larger and more irregular than those resulting from the first drying .",
    "this damage is noticeable at grain - grain contacts in desiccated samples . as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , these contacts involved the compression of one grain into the other , or the flattening out of sections of both grains .",
    "it is likely that these ` kissing ' contacts were created by the action of water - bridges joining the neighboring grains .",
    "such bridges create a strong capillary force , pulling adjacent grains together .",
    "any strength of the final , desiccated columnar state is presumably due to the surface ( van der waals ) forces acting across these contacts , as it is in powder compacts @xcite .       drying starch exhibits highly non - lilnear rheology .",
    "( a ) the effective young s modulus in a 2 mm thick starch - cake of @xmath3 = 0.3 g/@xmath4 is linearly dependent on the vertical strain ( tests at strain rates of 0.1 @xmath2 m/s ( black ) , 0.5 @xmath2 m/s ( grey ) , and 2 @xmath2 m/s ( white ) are shown ) .",

    "a non - linear elastic model is appropriate .",
    "the simplest such model to approximate a granular solid is that of 3rd order elasticity .",
    "this model was originally developed by landau to describe anharmonic elastic effects in crystals @xcite , but has been successfully applied to granular media in a wide variety of engineering and geophysical contexts @xcite . in its general form",
    "this model adds the next - lowest ( cubic ) order terms to the elastic energy density . in the absence of shear ,",

    "the effective young s modulus @xmath8 was measured in a 2 mm thick , partially dried starch - cake by compressing and releasing the sample under a 40 mm diameter , parallel plate rheometer headpiece ( ta instruments ra1000 ) , while observing the sample thickness and normal force response .",
    "experiments were performed over a range of compression and relaxation speeds , from 0.1 - 4 @xmath2 m/s , and there was no observable effect of the strain rate on the normal force response . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rheology](a ) , @xmath6 , the elastic modulus at zero strain , was found to be consistent with zero , and the landau modulus @xmath9=16@xmath11 mpa .",
    "tests at moisture concentrations of 0.3 and 0.4 g/@xmath4 showed no difference in results .",
    "an unusual feature of some granular solids is their lack of a well - defined stress relaxation time .",
    "they can display a slow dynamical relaxation of an applied stress , that is logarithmic in time @xcite .",
    "this behavior belongs to a class of relaxation mechanisms shared by a number of superficially unconnected systems in energetically jammed states , such as of the magnetization of spin glasses , or the dc susceptibility of granular magnetic media @xcite .",
    "the causes of these slow dynamics are not particularly well understood , although pauchard _",
    "have recently shown how the slow viscous deformation of nano - particles can relax stress @xcite .",
    "the stress - relaxation of starch - cakes was tested by compressing a cake with a fixed strain , and monitoring the responding normal force over time .",
    "alternatively , a fixed shear stress was applied for 5 minutes , and the relaxation of the shear strain was monitored , after the stress was released . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rheology](b ) , all starch - cakes showed a stress or residual shear that decayed logarithmically in time .",
    "these results imply that stress relaxation will only play a small role of the rheological response of a starch - cake to stress ; over the time - scale of a desiccation experiment , lasting of order 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11 s , these relaxation mechanisms could only reduce an imposed stress by approximately 15 - 20% . since the starch - cake remains irreversibly deformed after drying , however , some form of permanent particle deformation must occur .",

    "an oscillating u - tube densitometer ( anton paar dma 500 ) was also used to measure fluid density , although for dilute samples the settling of starch out of suspension affected these measurements .",

    "[ elastic2 ] , is equivalent to putting the sample under a uniform bi - axial stress of up to 160 kpa ( the vertical stress can be relieved by lowering the drying surface ) . internally , this strain is accommodated by the deformation of grains into each other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sem ] , through the process of liquid sintering @xcite .",
    "this measured stress is in reasonable agreement with the expected maximum attainable capillary pressure , typically taken to be of order 12@xmath69/@xmath0 = 110 kpa @xcite .",
    "a fine - scale fracture pattern develops at the drying surface at the start of the funicular regime , and further drying propagates the crack tips into the sample .",
    "this leads to a moving fracture front that tracks a clearly delineated boundary between relatively soft , moist starch , and harder dry starch , which has given way to columnar jointing .",
    "these two layers come apart easily when a partially dried sample is removed from its dish , as all the fracture tips are confined to a thin interface .",
    "the directional drying of an unsaturated starch - cake is related to the directional drying of thin colloidal layers @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "colloidal dispersions are typically confined within a small cell , and allowed to dry from one exposed face .",
    "stress builds up in the drying body , in response to a gradient in pore pressure .",
    "eventually , an array of cracks form at the exposed edge , and slowly advance into the solidifying network . like columnar joints ,",
    "these cracks are evenly spaced out , and advance perpendicular to a drying front .",
    "however , unlike joints in drying starch , it should be pointed out that cracks in colloidal dispersions occur while the drying body is still saturated with water @xcite .    throughout unsaturated drying ,",
    "the surface tension of the water bridges between grains gives a partially dried starch - cake much of its cohesiveness , and acts to pull the starch grains together .",
    "the bridge - grain structure has been modeled as a spring whose equilibrium position varies with @xmath3 , and which breaks when stretched beyond finite displacement @xcite .",
    "the compaction of grains into each other leads to the development of cracks , as any set of particle - particle contacts will contain some bonds which are weaker than others . by allowing such bonds to yield",
    ", the surrounding network of bridges relaxes .",
    "these assumptions give rise to fracture patterns that agree qualitatively with experiments , although there has been some difficulty in studying model systems sufficiently large enough to be checked quantitatively against experimental observation @xcite .",
    "future developments of this type of discrete - element model would ideally couple the water transport dynamics described above with the evolution equations for the springs .",
    "columnar joints have been reported in many thermoelastic systems , such as lava , smelter slag , and optical glass @xcite .",
    "however , starch remains the only known system in which columnar joints have been studied in detail .",
    "indeed , this unusual feature of dried starch - cakes has been independently rediscovered on several occasions @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that the diameter of columnar joints scales with the thickness of the drying front @xcite , which is in turn controlled by the cross - over in drying dynamics from flow - dominated transport , to vapor - dominated transport . in drying starches",
    ", this front is typically a few mm wide @xcite , and columnar joints are a few mm in diameter .",
    "it has been argued that columnar jointing occurs when the length scale set by the minimum diffusivity , and a characteristic drying time , is smaller than the thickness of the drying layer @xcite . in the previous section , it was demonstrated that the sudden transition between wet and dry starch arises from a broad , deep minimum in the diffusivity of moisture throughout the starchcake , which has been interpreted to arise from a large internal porosity , within starch grains . in the absence of these pores ,",
    "the minimum diffusivity has been estimated to be significantly larger @xcite , and the drying front would have a characteristic width of many cm .",
    "this suggests why , in most natural or laboratory situations , given that most soils do not share the observed porous structure of starch grains , the evolution of desiccation fracture patterns typically halts at the mud - crack stage .",
    "in other cases it may be possible to produce columnar joints , if the drying body is large enough .",
    "the experiments of gauthier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who observed the slow propagation of two perpendicular cracks , meeting at a vertex , in colloidal silica confined within a 1 mm diameter tube , suggest that 3-dimensional crack patterns such as columnar joints may be experimentally accessible in other drying systems of modest scale , for example .",
    "starch - water mixtures shrink and crack when dried .",
    "the simplicity of this system , and its use as a model for studying columnar joints , have encouraged considerable interest in the drying and cracking behavior of starch - cakes @xcite .",
    "the results presented here have shown , quantitatively , how directional drying occurs in starch - water mixtures .",
    "an effective separation of vapor and liquid water transport creates a bottleneck in the drying behavior , leading to this type of drying .    in order to evaluate how water is transported through a starch - cake",
    ", several properties of starch were measured .",
    "an unusually large cake porosity was observed , which was argued to be divided roughly equally between pore space within grains , and pore space between grains . by adapting a model of moisture transport ,",
    "it was shown how this division affects the transition between flow - dominated , and vapor - dominated water transport , causing the liquid transport to become ineffective in circumstances where considerable water remains in the body .",
    "a broad , deep minimum in the effective diffusivity of moisture followed , and lead to a sharp , propagating drying front .",
    "the total strain associated with this front is comparable to that predicted by capillary effects between grains .",
    "such a sharp shrinkage front appears to be necessary to generate columnar joints @xcite .",
    "the relatively unique behavior of drying starch slurries to give rise to columnar joints can thus be seen to arise directly from the unusual porous structure of starch grains , and the mechanics of moisture transport .",
    "the author wishes to thank s. w. morris and a. nishimoto for fruitful discussions , and a. f. routh for a critical reading of an early draft , and is grateful for access to apparatus across several departments at the university of toronto , and the university of washington ."
