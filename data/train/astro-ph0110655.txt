    "magnetic fields in cluster radio halos can be derived assuming a minimum energy configuration for the summed energy in relativistic particles and magnetic fields @xcite , corresponding roughly to energy equipartition between fields and particles .",
    "the equations for deriving minimum energy fields from radio observations are given in @xcite .",
    "estimates for minimum energy magnetic field strengths in cluster halos range from 0.1 to 1 @xmath0 g @xcite .",
    "one of the best studied halos is that in coma , for which @xcite report a minimum energy magnetic field of 0.4 @xmath0 g .",

    "all of these parameters are poorly constrained , although the magnetic field strength only behaves as these parameters raised to the @xmath27 power .",

    "@xcite present a method for estimating magnetic fields in the coma cluster radio halo independent of minimum energy assumptions .",
    "they base their analysis on considerations of the observed radio and x - ray spectra , the electron inverse compton and synchrotron radiative lifetimes , and reasonable mechanisms for particle reacceleration .",
    "they conclude that the fields vary smoothly from 2@xmath291 @xmath0 g in the cluster center , to 0.3@xmath290.1 @xmath0 g at 1 mpc radius .",
    "a possibly related phenomena to radio halos is a class of sources found in the outskirts of clusters known as radio relics . like the radio halos , these are very extended sources without an identifiable host galaxy ( fig .  [ coma ] ) . unlike radio halos ,",
    "radio relics are often elongated or irregular in shape , are located at the cluster periphery ( by definition ) , and are strongly polarized , up to 50% in the case of the relic 0917 + 75 @xcite . as the name implies , one of the first explanations put forth to explain these objects was that these are the remnants of a radio jet associated with an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) that has since turned off and moved on .",
    "a problem with this model is that , once the energy source is removed , the radio source is expected to fade on a timescale @xmath30 years due to adiabatic expansion , inverse compton , and synchrotron losses ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "this short timescale precludes significant motion of the host galaxy from the vicinity of the radio source .",
    "a more compelling explanation is that the relics are the result of first order fermi acceleration ( fermi i ) of relativistic particles in shocks produced during cluster mergers @xcite , or are fossil radio sources revived by compression associated with cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "equipartition field strengths for relics range from 0.4  2.7 @xmath31 g @xcite .",
    "if the relics are produced by shocks or compression during a cluster merger , then @xcite calculate a pre - shock cluster magnetic field strength in the range 0.2 - 0.5 @xmath0 g .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field in an ionized plasma sets a preferential direction for the gyration of electrons , leading to a difference in the index of refraction for left versus right circularly polarized radiation .",
    "linearly polarized light propagating through a magnetized plasma experiences a phase shift of the left versus right circularly polarized components of the wavefront , leading to a rotation of the plane of polarization , @xmath32 = rm @xmath33 , where @xmath32 is the change in the position angle of polarization , @xmath34 is the wavelength of the radiation , and rm is the faraday rotation measure .",
    "the rm is related to the electron density , @xmath35 , and the magnetic field , @xmath36 , as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is measured in @xmath0gauss , @xmath39 in @xmath40  and @xmath41*l * in kpc , and the bold face symbols represent the vector product between the magnetic field and the direction of propagation .",
    "this phenomenon can also be understood qualitatively by considering the forces on the electrons .",
    "synchrotron radiation from cosmic radio sources is well known to be linearly polarized , with fractional polarizations up to 70@xmath16 in some cases @xcite .",
    "rotation measures can be derived from multifrequency polarimetric observations of these sources by measuring the position angle of the polarized radiation as a function of frequency .",
    "the rm values can then be combined with measurements of @xmath39 to estimate the magnetic fields . due to the vector product in eq .",
    "1 , only the magnetic field component along the line - of - sight is measured , so the results depend on the assumed magnetic field topology .",
    "most extragalactic radio sources exhibit faraday rotation measures ( rms ) of the order of 10 s of rad m@xmath15  due to propagation of the emission through the interstellar medium of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "sources at galactic latitudes @xmath42 can exhibit @xmath1300 rad m@xmath15 . for the past 30 years , however , a small number of extragalactic sources were known to have far higher rms than could be readily explained as galactic in origin .",
    "large intrinsic rms were suspected , but the mechanism(s ) producing them were unclear .",
    "@xcite discovered that the powerful radio galaxy cygnus  a had large , and very different rms ( 35 vs @xmath431350 rad m@xmath15 ) , in its two lobes .",
    "while its low galactic latitude ( 5.8 ) could possibly be invoked to explain the high rms , the large difference in rms over just 2  was difficult to reproduce in the context of galactic models @xcite .",
    "this `` rm anomaly '' was clarified when @xcite performed the first high resolution rm studies with the vla and found complex structure in the rm distribution on arcsec scales ( fig .",
    "[ cyga ] ) , with gradients as large as 600 rad m@xmath15 arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "these large gradients conclusively ruled out a galactic origin for the large rms .",
    "perhaps just as important as the observed rm structure across the lobes of cygnus a was the discovery that the observed position angles behave quadratically with wavelength to within very small errors over a wide range in wavelengths @xcite .",
    "examples of this phenomenon are shown in ( fig .",
    "[ hydfits ] ) .",
    "moreover , the change in position angle from short to long wavelengths is much larger than @xmath44 radians in many cases , while the fractional polarization remains constant .",
    "this result is critical for interpreting the large rms for cluster center radio sources , providing rigorous proof that the large rms can not be due to thermal gas mixed with the radio emitting plasma @xcite .",
    "such mixing would lead to rapid depolarization with increasing wavelength , and departures from a quadratic behavior of @xmath45 with wavelength @xcite .",
    "= 5.3 in    the cygnus a observations were the first to show that the large rms must arise in an external screen of magnetized , ionized plasma , but can not be galactic in origin . @xcite",
    "considered a number of options for the faraday screen toward cygnus a , and concluded that the most likely site was the x - ray emitting cluster atmosphere enveloping the radio source @xcite .",
    "they found that magnetic fields in the cluster gas of 210 @xmath0 g could produce the observed rms .    since the ground - breaking observations of cygnus a ,",
    "rm studies of cluster center radio sources have become a standard tool for measuring cluster fields .",
    "rm studies of radio galaxies in clusters can be divided into studies of cooling - flow and non - cooling - flow clusters .",
    "cooling - flow clusters are those in which the x - ray emission is strongly peaked at the center , leading to high densities and cooling times of the hot icm in the inner @xmath1100 kpc of much less than the hubble time . to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium , an inward flow may be required @xcite .",
    "typical mass cooling flow rates are 100  .",
    "the actual presence of material `` cooling '' and `` flowing '' is a topic that is hotly debated at present @xcite .",
    "what is more agreed upon is that cooling - flow clusters are more dynamically relaxed than non - cooling flow clusters which often show evidence of cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "radio galaxies in cooling flow clusters attracted some of the first detailed rm studies by virtue of their anomalously high rms ( _ e.g. _ , a1795 : @xcite ; hydra a : @xcite ) . out of a sample of 14 cooling - flow clusters with strong embedded radio sources",
    "@xcite , found that 10 of 14 sources display rms in excess of 800 rad m@xmath15 , two ( pks0745 - 191 and 3c84 in abell 426 ) could not be measured due to a lack of polarized flux , and two ( abell 119 @xcite and 3c129@xcite ) have lower rms , but with better x - ray observations turn out not to be in cooling - flow clusters .",
    "hence , current data are consistent with all radio galaxies at the center of cooling flow clusters having extreme rms , with the magnitude of the rms roughly proportional to the cooling flow rate ( see fig .",
    "[ rmxdot ] ) .",
    "= 5.0 in    the rm distributions for radio sources found at the centers of cooling flow clusters tend to be patchy with coherence lengths of 510 kpc ( fig .",

    "larger `` patches '' up to 30 kpc are seen for example in cygnus  a ( fig .",
    "[ cyga ] ) . in both cygnus",
    "a and hydra  a one can find `` bands '' of alternating high and low rm ( see figures [ cyga ] and [ hyda ] ) .",
    "such bands are also found in the non - cooling flow cluster sources @xcite , along with slightly larger coherence lengths of 1530 kpc .",
    "in hydra  a there is a strong trend for all the rms to the north of the nucleus to be positive and to the south negative . to explain this requires a field reversal and implies a large - scale ( 100 kpc ) ordered component to the cluster magnetic fields in hydra  a. @xcite found the large scale field strength to be @xmath17 @xmath0 g , and more tangled fields to have a strength of @xmath140 @xmath0 g .",
    "a similar rm sign reversal across the nucleus is seen in a1795 , although in this case the radio source is only 11 kpc in extent .",
    "minimum cluster magnetic field strengths can be estimated by assuming a constant magnetic field along the line - of - sight through the cluster .",
    "such estimates usually lead to magnetic field strengths of 5 to 10 @xmath0 g in cooling flow clusters , and a bit less ( factor @xmath12 ) in the non - cooling flow clusters .",
    "= 5.3 in    from the patchiness of the rm distributions it is clear that the magnetic fields are not regularly ordered on cluster ( mpc ) scales , but have coherence scales between 5 and 10 kpc .",
    "beyond measuring a mean line - of - site field , the next level of rm modeling entails ` cells ' of constant size and magnetic field strength , but random magnetic field direction , uniformly filling the cluster .",
    "the rm produced by such a screen will be built up in a random walk fashion and will thus have an average value of 0 rad m@xmath15 , but a dispersion in the rm , @xmath46 , that is proportional to the square root of the number of cells along the line - of - sight through the cluster .",
    "the most commonly - fit form to the x - ray observations to obtain the radial electron density distribution , @xmath47 through a cluster is the modified king model @xcite :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the central density , @xmath50 is the core radius , and @xmath51 is a free parameter in the fit .",
    "typical values for these parameters are @xmath52 kpc , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 @xmath40 .    for this density profile and cells of constant magnetic strength but random orientation ,",
    "@xcite derived the following relation for the rm dispersion :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the cell size , @xmath57 is the distance of the radio source from the cluster center , @xmath58 is the gamma function , and k is a factor which depends on the location of the radio source along the line - of - sight through the cluster : k = 624 if the source is beyond the cluster , and k = 441 if the source is halfway through the cluster .",
    "note that eq .",
    "3 assumes that the magnetic field strength , @xmath59 , is related to the component along the line of sight , ( @xmath60 ) , by @xmath61 .",
    "the cell size , @xmath56 , can be estimated to first order from the observed coherence lengths of the rm distributions .",
    "both cooling - flow and non - cooling flow clusters yield typical estimates of 5 to 10 kpc .",
    "magnetic field strength estimates , however are two to three times higher in the cooling - flow clusters ",
    "19 @xmath0 g in the 3c295 cluster @xcite compared to 6 @xmath0 g in the 3c129 cluster @xcite using the methodology described above .",
    "most radio sources found embedded in clusters are located at the center and identified with a cd galaxy .",
    "this relatively high pressure environment has been found in many cases to confine or distort the radio galaxy @xcite , as well as giving rise to extreme rms .",
    "for this same reason the extended radio sources in hydra  a and cygnus  a are unique in that they sample regions over 100 kpc in linear extent .",

    "1 implies that the observed rotation measures are heavily weighted by the innermost cells in the cluster @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that high rms may result from an interaction between the radio galaxy and the icm , such that the rms are generated locally , and are not indicative of cluster magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite proposed a model in which the rm screen is due to a boundary layer surrounding the radio source in which the large magnetic fields within the radio source are mixed with the large thermal densities outside the radio source by kelvin - helmholtz waves along the contact discontinuity .",
    "this model predicts a faraday depolarized region of a few kpc extent surrounding the radio source , where the synchrotron emitting material has mixed with the thermal gas .",
    "such a depolarized shell has not been observed to date .    in general , extreme rms have been observed in sources of very different morphologies , from edge - brightened ( fanaroff - riley class ii @xcite ) , to edge darkened ( fr i ) sources .",
    "the models for the hydrodynamic evolution of these different classes of sources are thought to be very different , with the frii sources expanding supersonically , while the fri sources expand sub - sonically @xcite .",
    "this argues that the high rms are not solely a phenomenon arising due to a local interaction between the radio source and its environment , but are more likely to be a property of the large scale ( _ i.e. _ , cluster ) environment .",
    "perhaps the most telling argument against the interaction model is that rm studies of background radio sources seen through cluster atmospheres also indicate @xmath0 g cluster magnetic fields ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "while we feel that large rms for cluster center radio sources most likely arise in the large scale cluster atmosphere , we should point out that there are some cases in which the radio source does appear to compress the gas and fields in the icm to produce local rm enhancements .",
    "for example , there is evidence for an rm enhancement due to the bow shock preceding the radio hot spots in cygnus a and 3c194 @xcite .",
    "however , even in these cases the implied external ( _ i.e. _ , unperturbed ) icm fields are a few @xmath0 g .",

    "they also argue that the fields can not be much stronger than this , since dynamically dominant fields would suppress mixing along the entire front , which does not appear to be the case .",
    "the existence of cold fronts provides strong evidence for cluster magnetic fields .",
    "however , the field strengths derived correspond to those in the tangentially sheared boundary region around the front .",
    "relating these back to the unperturbed cluster field probably requires a factor of a few reduction in field strength , implying unperturbed field strengths between 1 and 10 @xmath0 g , although the exact scale factor remains uncertain @xcite .",
    "two interesting issues have arisen in the study of cluster gas and gravitational masses .",
    "first is the fact that total gravitating masses derived from weak gravitational lensing are a factor of a few higher than those derived from x - ray observations of cluster atmospheres assuming hydrostatic equilibrium of isothermal atmospheres @xcite . and second is the ` baryon crisis ' , in which the baryonic mass of a cluster , which is dominated by the mass of gas in the hot cluster atmosphere , corresponds to roughly 5@xmath16 of the gravitational mass derived assuming hydrostatic equilibrium for an isothermal cluster atmosphere .",
    "this baryon fraction is a factor of three to five larger than the baryon fraction dictated by big bang nucleosynthesis in inflationary world models @xcite .",

    "a number of authors have investigated the possibility of magnetic pressure support for cluster atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the required fields are about 50@xmath0 g , which is an order of magnitude , or more , larger than the measured fields in most cases , except perhaps in the inner 10 s of kpc of cooling flow clusters . for most relaxed clusters",

    "other mechanisms for non - thermal pressure support of cluster atmospheres involve motions of the cluster gas other than thermal , such as turbulent or bulk motions due to a recent cluster merger @xcite . for relaxed clusters a number of groups have shown that the lensing and x - ray mass estimates can be reconciled by using non - isothermal models for the cluster atmospheres , i.e. , by allowing for radial temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that eev cosmic rays lose energy due to photo - pion production through interaction with the cmb .",
    "these losses limit the propagation distance for @xmath122 ev particles to about 60 mpc . yet",
    "no clear correlation has been found between the arrival direction of high energy cosmic rays and the most likely sites of origin for eev particles , namely , agn at distances less than 60 mpc @xcite .",
    "one solution to the gzk paradox is to assume the energetic particles are isotropized in the igm by tangled magnetic fields , effectively randomizing their observed arrival direction .",
    "such isotropization requires fields in the local super - cluster @xmath123 g @xcite .",
    "in table 1 we summarize the cluster magnetic field measurements . given the limitations of the current instrumentation , the limited number of sources studied thus far , and the myriad physical assumptions involved with each method , we are encouraged by the order - of - magnitude agreement between cluster field strengths derived from these different methods .",
    "overall , the data are consistent with cluster atmospheres containing @xmath124 g fields , with perhaps an order of magnitude scatter in field strength between clusters , or within a given cluster .",
    "the rotation measure observations of background radio sources , and in particular the observations of a complete x - ray selected sample of clusters by @xcite dictate that @xmath0 g magnetic fields with high areal filling factors are a standard feature in clusters , and that the fields extend to large radii ( 0.5 mpc or more ) .",
    "the rotation measure observations of extended radio galaxies embedded in clusters impose order on the fields , with coherence scales of order 10 kpc , although larger scale coherence in overall rm sign can be seen in some sources .",

    "but the fields play a fundamental role in the energy budget of the icm through their effect on heat conduction , as is dramatically evident in high resolution x - ray observations of cluster cold fronts .    if most clusters contain @xmath0 g magnetic fields , then why do nt most clusters have radio halos ?",
    "the answer may be the short lifetimes of the relativistic electrons responsible for the synchrotron radio emission ( see  4.1 ) . without re - acceleration or injection of relativistic electrons , a synchrotron halo emitting at 1.4 ghz will fade in about 10@xmath114 years due to synchrotron and inverse compton losses .",
