    "there is an extensive literature - both mathematical and physical- on the on decay estimates for wave equations and schrdinger equations with a potential , starting with strichartz s work for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath11 , important in physics , is the subject of many recent papers where a variety of modern analytical tools and different assumptions on @xmath12 are used ( see @xcite and also @xcite for a survey ) .    in the physical community",
    "the corresponding problem goes by the name of tails , and the precise description of these tails is an important issue in scattering theory .",
    "based on nonrigorous and numerical methods , physicists predicted that the solutions to wave equations on the line with potentials decaying like @xmath13 as @xmath14 will decay in time like @xmath15 , see for example @xcite .",

    "they also obtained a similar estimate for the more important regge - wheeler potential , though it is not known whether the estimate is sharp ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give for the decay of @xmath18 where @xmath20 for large @xmath1 ( the constants are allowed to be different for positive and negative @xmath21 ) where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the result is consistent with @xcite and confirms the predictions by physicists .",
    "our method is based on inverse laplace transform of the equation in @xmath4 , a technique first used to study the time decay of schrdinger equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and it can applied to potentials consisting of a finite sum of inverse powers , the largest of which being @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a real number , as well as potentials of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 ( see section [ extend ] ) .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that it gives sharp estimates based on explicit calculations",
