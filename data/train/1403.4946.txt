    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are among the oldest objects in galaxies",
    ". they can provide a wealth of information on the formation and evolution histories of their host galaxies as well as on cosmological structure formation @xcite .",
    "this paper is a first step in connecting and understanding properties of gc systems , their host galaxies and their central supermassive black holes .",
    "surveys of elliptical galaxies show radial gc profiles to be less concentrated when compared to the galactic stellar light profiles ( and references therein ) .",
    "an impressive example is the 10 kpc core in the spatial distribution of gcs in ngc  4874 , one of the two dominant elliptical galaxies inside the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "two competing scenarios attempt to explain these cored distributions . in one scenario , the core originated from processes operating at the onset of galaxy formation in the very early universe @xcite .",
    "the other scenario assumes that gcs were formed co - evally with the field stars with a cuspy distribution , i.e. comparable to the galactic stellar light profile . in this second scenario ,",
    "the observed cores in the gc distributions are caused by the subsequent erosion and destruction of globular clusters in the nucleus of the galaxy itself .",
    "it is this scenario we would like to shed light on with this study .",
    "however , taking all the relevant processes that affect the gc erosion rates in elliptical galaxies into account is numerically challenging .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are several internal and external processes acting simultaneously on the dissolution of globular clusters , such as two - body relaxation , stellar mass loss and tidal shocks @xcite . in this study",
    ", we present a new code named muesli to investigate several processes that dominate cluster erosion : ( i ) tidal shocks on eccentric gc orbits and relaxation driven dissolution , and their dependence on the anisotropy profile of the gc population , ( ii ) tidal destruction of gcs due to a central super - massive black hole ( iii ) stellar evolution and ( iv ) orbital decay through dynamical friction .",
    "that is :    \\(i ) gcs lose mass when stars get beyond the limiting jacobi radius , @xmath1 , and become unbound to the cluster .",
    "two - body relaxation will cause any gc to dissolve with time .",
    "the dissolution time depends on the mass and extent of the gc as well as the strength of the tidal field @xcite .",
    "gcs on very eccentric orbits are particularly susceptible for disintegration within a few orbits owing to the strong tidal forces near the galactic center . in radially biased velocity distributions , large fractions of orbits",
    "are occupied by such eccentric , i.e. low angular momentum orbits , and the overall destruction rate of globular clusters is strongly enhanced over the isotropic case .",
    "the same holds for triaxial galaxies when globular clusters move on box orbits @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the gradient of the potential which is relevant for the destruction of gcs is increased by the presence of supermassive black holes .",
    "smbhs are commonly found in the cores of luminous galaxies @xcite and the connection between smbhs and globular clusters is of particular interest . @xcite and @xcite found empirical relations between the total number of gcs and the mass of the central black hole .",
    "the origin of this linear @xmath2 relation is under debate .",
    "see @xcite for a most recent version of the @xmath2 relation and comparison to other globular cluster / host galaxy relations .",
    "there is some evidence that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are indirectly coupled over the properties of their host galaxies @xcite , however a direct causal link can not be ruled out owing to the difficulty of studying the growth of smbhs from accreted cluster debris .",
    "\\(iii ) another effect is mass loss by stellar evolution ( sev ) .",
    "sev decreases the globular cluster mass most significantly during an initial phase of roughly @xmath5 myr . in this period ,",
    "o and b stars lose most of their mass through stellar winds and supernovae ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "over a hubble time , a stellar population loses about 30 - 40% of its mass due to stellar evolution @xcite    \\(iv ) finally , massive objects like globular clusters lose energy and angular momentum due to dynamical friction ( df ) when migrating through an entity of background particles .",
    "gcs will gradually approach the center of the galaxy where they are destroyed efficiently as described above . in low luminosity spheroids ( @xmath6 )",
    "decaying gcs might also merge together and contribute to the growth of nuclear star clusters @xcite . among other quantities ,",
    "the efficiency of df depends on the departure of the host galaxy from spherical symmetry @xcite , and becomes largest for low angular momentum orbits @xcite .    like a real muesli , our lti - purpose lliptical galaxy cf + time - transformed eapfrog ntegrator ( muesli )",
    "consists of several well chosen ingredients .",
    "muesli has a high flexibility and is designed for computing gc orbits and erosion rates in live galaxies .",
    "it can handle spherical , axisymmetric and triaxial galaxies with arbitrary density profiles , velocity distributions and central smbh masses for which no analytical distribution functions exist .",
    "since the potential of the galaxy is computed self - consistently , the code can handle time evolving potentials due to e.g. the interaction of the galaxy and a central black hole @xcite or even non - virialised structures .",
    "muesli is designed to constrain the field - star and gc formation efficiencies in the early universe .",
    "this can be done by relating the computational outcomes with observations of the gc specific frequency , @xmath7 , which is the number of observed globular clusters normalized to to total mass / luminosity of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the u - shaped @xmath7 distribution , being highest for the least massive and most massive galaxies , traces the impact of feedback processes operating in different galactic environments .",
    "however , the quantitative examination of these processes requires knowledge about the total fraction of gcs eroded over time .    in this first paper , we provide detailed information about the code and about @xmath0-body model generation , and we show results from the code testing .",
    "we apply our code to erosion processes of gcs inside spherical galaxies with hernquist and srsic profiles , isotropic and radially biased velocity distributions and central smbhs .",
    "this is done for four representative galaxies .",
    "these galaxies cover a wide range of masses ( @xmath8 ) , sizes ( @xmath9 ) and central smbh masses ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "erosion rates in axisymmetric and triaxial galaxies , as well as nuclear star cluster and smbh growth processes by cluster debris are reserved for later publications .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the muesli code and the dynamics governing globular cluster dissolution and disruption processes are specified in ",
    "[ sec : method ] . at the end of this section",
    "we introduce the initial conditions of the gcs and discuss the generation of the underlying galaxy models .",
    "results are presented in   [ sec : results ] , followed by a critical discussion (   [ sec : critical_discussion ] ) .",
    "the main findings are summarized in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "extensive tests of the code are carried out in the appendix   [ sec : testing ] .",
    "in the following we briefly describe the main ingredients of muesli .",
    "these ingredients can easily be modified , exchanged or upgraded , making muesli a versatile platform for the study of gc dynamics in elliptical galaxies and related problems .",
    "the computations are performed with the self - consistent field ( scf ) method @xcite .",
    "the scf algorithm uses a basis - function approach to evaluate an expression for the potential @xmath11 from the underlying matter configuration .",
    "the orders @xmath12 of the radial and angular expansion terms can be adjusted to match the type of galaxy . in the underlying study",
    "we restrict ourselves to spherically symmetric galaxies .",
    "the usage of @xmath13 in spherical galaxy models can result in inhomogeneities and unphysical drifts of the angular momentum vectors .",
    "therefore @xmath14 is adopted for the main computation of the spherical galaxies of this study , while @xmath15 is chosen for axisymmetric and triaxial galaxies .",
    "tests are performed in   [ subsec : testing_discreteness ] and   [ subsec : testing_phasespace ] .",
    "the particle trajectories are integrated forward in time with the time - transformed leapfrog ( ttl ) scheme @xcite combined with an iteration method to account for the inclusion of external ( velocity - dependent ) forces .",
    "these forces are the dynamical friction force (   [ subsubsec : df ] ) and post newtonian forces allowing to mimic general relativistic effects arising from the central smbh .",
    "post - newtonian terms are not relevant for gc destruction processes as they occur on distances much larger than event horizon scales where gr effects are negligible and so we do not consider them for this study .    while the code uses conventional model units , @xmath16 , the relevant globular cluster quantities (   [ subsec : init_cond_gc_mass_size ] ) as well as the dynamical friction force (   [ subsubsec : df ] )",
    "are defined in physical dimensions .",
    "the scaling of time , mass and size is performed during computations .",
    "we aim at quantifying the relevance of internal and external effects like stellar evolution (   [ subsubsec : dyn_of_gss_relaxation ] ) , relaxation driven evolution of gcs in tidal fields (   [ subsubsec : dyn_of_gss_relaxation ] ) , tidal disruption through shocks (   [ subsubsec : tidal_shocks ] ) and dynamical friction (   [ subsubsec : df ] ) for shaping a cored gc distribution .",
    "stellar evolution reduces the cluster mass most significantly during an initial phase of roughly @xmath5 myr . during this period ,",
    "the most massive stars lose mass through stellar winds and supernovae ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we implemented the combined scheme for stellar evolution and energy - equipartition driven evaporation in tidal fields from @xcite .",
    "compared to the long - term dynamical evolution , sev decreases the initial cluster mass nearly instantaneously by @xmath17 ( @xcite , their figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , initial sev can be taken into account by using a constant gc mass correction factor of 0.70 ( @xcite , their equation 12 ) .",
    "on the other hand , two - body relaxation causes a more continuous mass loss @xcite .",
    "due to two - body encounters , stars gain enough energy so that they can leave the cluster . in the long term",
    ", this process leads to the dissolution of any star cluster .",
    "the process of relaxation - driven mass loss is accelerated when globular clusters are embedded in the external tidal field of a host galaxy as the potential barrier for escape is lowered @xcite . in this case , a star may separate from the gc when passing beyond a characteristic radius , commonly known as the jacobi radius , @xmath1 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . when the cluster moves on a non - circular orbit",
    "the tidal field strength varies with time , and so does the jacobi radius . with growing eccentricity of the cluster s orbit , the extrema between the jacobi radius at perigalacticon , where it is smallest , and apogalacticon increase ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggests that the time dependent mass loss rate of gcs in tidal fields can be approximated by a linear function .",
    "a few modifications were added to account for arbitrary galactic density profiles and changing gc orbits caused by dynamical friction .",
    "this is done by first computing the galactocentric distance , @xmath18 , and velocity , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the acceleration at the position of the globular cluster .",

    "the initial number of globular cluster stars , @xmath29 , is approximated by @xmath30 @xcite .",

    ", we use an average of the pericenter and apocenter velocity @xmath35 to account for the varying circular velocity .",
    "once the mass of a cluster is less than @xmath36 , it is assumed to be dissolved .",
    "the variation of the tidal field does not only enhance the overall mass loss rate but also increases the cluster s internal energy @xcite .",
    "if the pericentre distance to the galactic center is small , the energy input through tidal variation acts like a tidal shock and the energy gain of the cluster is significant @xcite . in these cases",
    "mass loss of the cluster gets driven by tidal shocks leading to quick cluster dissolution @xcite .",

    "it may therefore be possible that the radial acceleration @xmath147 as well as the evaluation of the jacobi radius ( eq .  [ f1 ] ) are affected and a cluster is incorrectly assumed to be destroyed by tidal forces . to guarantee computational outcomes free of biased gc disruption rates",
