    "many economic outcomes arise as a consequence of agents decisions under the influence of others choices .",
    "endogeneity of such influence poses the main challenge for an empirical researcher . in response to this challenge ,",
    "a strand of empirical methods explicitly model interactions among the agents .",
    "these models often share two main features .",
    "first , they assume observation of many i.i.d .",
    "replications from a single representative game , so that statistical independence is imposed across the replications , whereas strategic interdependence is kept within each replication .",
    "second , they rely on a common prior assumption , where the type distribution is assumed to be common knowledge among the players .",
    "( see bresnahan and reiss ( 1991 ) , tamer ( 2003 ) , ciliberto and tamer ( 2009 ) , aradillas - lopez ( 2010 ) , beresteanu , molchanov , and molinari ( 2011 ) , aradillas - lopez and tamer ( 2008 ) , and de paula and tang ( 2011 ) , among many others , for methodological contributions . )",
    "such a framework does not fit well a situation where there are interactions among many agents .",
    "for example , consider studying peer effects among students .",
    "one may view interactions among the students in each school as one game .",
    "each school has a different number of students . in order to view the games as arising from a single representative game ,",
    "one introduces further specifications such as whether the equilibrium is selected across schools differently or not , whether the strategies of students in the same school are the same or not , etc .",
    "this observation applies to many other examples , such as studies on neighborhood effects on the choice of housing location or on the effect of friendship networks on the students smoking behavior .",
    "many such examples are found in the literature of social interactions .",
    "( see brock and durlauf ( 2001b and 2007 ) for their pioneering works on the structural modeling of social interactions .",
    "see also surveys by brock and durlauf ( 2001a ) and a recent monograph by ioannides ( 2013 ) for this literature . )",
    "this paper proposes an alternative modeling view in which heterogeneity across the games and heterogeneity across the players are given characteristics of a single large bayesian game .",
    "for example , in the study of the peer effects mentioned before , this framework views interactions within each school as a subgame of a large game , where subgames are allowed to be heterogeneous in various aspects such as the number of the players , their payoff specifications , and the way they form beliefs about other players types . furthermore , the sets of subgame equilibria across different subgames are not required to be identical .",
    "the econometrician observes outcomes from a pure strategy bayesian nash equilibrium ( possibly among multiple equilibria ) , and attempts to make inference about the structural parameters of the game .",
    "while the equilibrium is driven by the subjective beliefs of the players , the validity of the econometrician s inference is measured in terms of the nature s objective probability .",
    "thus the inference procedure in this paper is valid regardless of how an equilibrium is selected , or whether the sets of equilibria across different games are identical or not .",
    "the main departure of this model from the existing literature is that the players are allowed to form beliefs differently from each other .",
    "regarding the subjective beliefs of the players , it is assumed that they commonly ( and correctly ) believe that the types are conditionally independent given their public signal , and that any event a player believes highly likely to occur does occur with high probability . within the boundary of these two conditions ,",
    "each player is allowed to form beliefs differently using potentially different priors .",
    "thus the inference procedure in this paper is robust to the way individual players form their beliefs about other players types or beliefs .",
    "if it is desirable that the predictions from game models be robust to particular assumptions about individual players belief formation , as emphasized by wilson ( 1989 ) and bergemann and morris ( 2005 ) , the same may apply all the more to econometric inference on such models .",
    "rationalizability where uncertainty faced by a player is about other players actions , whereas uncertainty faced by a player in this paper s game is confined to other players payoff types .",
    "second , the main purpose of the study by aradillas - lopez and tamer ( 2008 ) was to explore implications of various higher order belief configurations for econometric inference , whereas this paper pursues an inference method robust to various higher order belief configurations within the nash equilibrium framework . ]",
    "the main challenge for the econometrician in this environment is to recover the subjective beliefs .",
    "manski ( 2004 ) proposes using data on subjective probabilities in choice studies .",
    "see dominitz and manski ( 1997 ) for a study on subjective income expectations , and li and lee ( 2009 ) for an investigation of rational expectations assumptions in social interactions using subjective expectations data .",
    "however , in strategic environments with many players , it is often not easy to procure data on players expectations on other players types prior to the play .    instead of attempting to recover subjective beliefs",
    ", this paper develops what this paper calls a _",
    "hindsight regret approach _ , based on the insights of kalai ( 2004 ) and deb and kalai ( 2010 ) .",
    "hindsight regret _ for each player measures _ ex _ _ post _ payoff loss due to the player s not being able to observe the other players types . more specifically , the hindsight regret quantifies the amount of additional compensation needed to preserve each player s incentive compatibility constraint in equilibrium even after all the players types are revealed .",
    "this paper provides a general form of belief - free hindsight regret which is used to form an _ ex post _ version of incentive compatibility constraints for each player in equilibrium .    using the _ ex post _ incentive compatibility constraints ,",
    "this paper derives testable implications which the econometrician can use for inference without knowledge of a particular way beliefs are formed .",
    "the implications are formulated as moment inequalities in a spirit similar to ciliberto and tamer ( 2009 ) .",
    "the tightness of the moment inequalities ( thus the nontriviality of subsequent inference ) depends on how strongly any two players are strategically interdependent .",
    "when the reference group is large , and each player s payoff is affected by the action of another player in inverse proportion to the group sizes , the inequalities can be fairly tight , opening the possibility of nontrivial inference .",
    "on the other hand , this condition excludes the situation where the econometrician observes many small private information games as in aradillas - lopez ( 2010 ) and de paula and tang ( 2011 ) .    for inference ,",
    "the paper proposes two wild bootstrap methods and establishes their asymptotic validity , as the number of the players increases to infinity .",
    "the asymptotic validity is uniform over the probabilities that the nature adopts for drawing the players types .",
    "this paper s approach for inference is inspired by the work of andrews ( 2005 ) who investigated the inference problem in the presence of common shocks in short panel data .",
    "( see kuersteiner and prutcha ( 2012 ) for a related research on dynamic panel models . ) as in andrews ( 2005 ) , the test statistic proposed in this paper has a functional of a mixture normal distribution as its limiting distribution in the least favorable configuration of the null hypothesis , but we can not use the random norming as he did to pivotize the test statistic , because the restrictions here are inequalities rather than equalities .",
    "the method of wild bootstrap in this paper obviates the need to pivotize the test statistic .",
    "later the paper presents a monte carlo simulation study based on a social interactions model .",
    "first , it is found that the larger the hindsight regrets are , the more conservative the inference becomes .",
    "this finding is intuitive",
    ". when the hindsight regrets are large , the testable restrictions are not strong enough to give nontrivial information about the structural parameters .",
    "second , even when the coverage probabilities are reported to be 1 , the bootstrap inference may exhibit good power properties .",
    "third , when the social interaction parameter is positive , its confidence set covers zero with almost zero probability , which means the bootstrap procedure detects deviation from the null hypothesis of no social interaction extremely well .",
    "fourth , the results show that ignoring the hindsight regrets lead to invalid inference in general .",
    "the existing econometrics literature of games often assumes observation of many independent replications from a single representative game , so that statistical independence is imposed across the replications , whereas strategic interdependence is kept within each replication .",
    "see bresnahan and reiss ( 1991 ) , tamer ( 2003 ) , ciliberto and tamer ( 2009 ) , aradillas - lopez ( 2010 ) , bajari , hong , krainer and nekipelov ( 2010 ) , beresteanu , molchanov , and molinari ( 2011 ) , aradillas - lopez and tamer ( 2008 ) , and de paula and tang ( 2011 ) for example .",
    "see de paula ( 2010 ) for references .",
    "see krauth ( 2006 ) and de paula ( 2010 ) for using the framework of many replications of a representative game in analysis of social interactions among people .",
    "in contrast to such a framework , this paper s approach does not require that one observe many games for asymptotically valid inference .",
    "the asymptotic validity holds as long as the number of the players is large , regardless of how they are partitioned into different subgames .",
    "this feature is convenient in particular , for it accommodates a single large game such as a social interactions model with multiple large overlapping reference groups .",
    "this paper s framework is most relevant to various models of social interactions . as a seminal paper in the structural modeling and estimation of social interactions , brock and durlauf ( 2001 ) developed discrete choice - based models of social interactions .",
    "their discrete - choice based approach influenced many researches such as krauth ( 2006 ) , ioannides and zabel ( 2008 ) , and li and lee ( 2009 ) to name but a few .",
    "( see blume , brock , durlauf , and ioannides ( 2011 ) and the monograph by ioannides ( 2010 ) for recent methodological progresses in the literature of social interactions . )",
    "in contrast with this approach , this paper relaxes symmetry of equilibrium strategies or rational expectations .",
    "furthermore , this paper fully develops a bootstrap inference procedure which is asymptotically valid regardless of whether there are multiple equilibria , or how the equilibrium is selected across different games . on the other hand ,",
    "the approach of brock and durlauf , within the boundary of their set - up , is simpler to use than this paper s approach .",
    "it is also worthwhile to compare this paper s approach with recent researches by xu ( 2012 ) , bisin , moro , and topa ( 2011 ) , and menzel ( 2012 ) .",
    "these researches are more explicit about the inferential issues in a large game model .",
    "xu ( 2012 ) studied a single large bayesian game framework like this paper , but his inference procedure requires various conditions that yield uniqueness of the equilibrium and point - identification of the parameters . on the other hand , bisin ,",
    "moro , and topa ( 2011 ) admit multiple equilibria , but their equilibrium concept requires asymptotic stability of the aggregate quantities ( as the number of the players increases ) .",
    "menzel ( 2012 ) recently developed asymptotic theory for inference based on large complete information games where type - action profiles are ( conditionally ) exchangeable sequences .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first section formally introduces a large bayesian game , and discusses examples .",
    "section 3 introduces a belief - free version of hindsight regrets .",
    "section 4 turns to the assumptions for econometric inference , and derives testable implications .",
    "section 5 proposes general inference methods and establishes their uniform asymptotic validity .",
    "section 6 presents and discusses monte carlo simulation results .",
    "for simplicity of exposition , most of the results in the paper are obtained assuming a binary action space .",
    "their extension to the case of a general finite action set is provided in the appendix .",
    "a supplemental note to this paper is available .",
    "the note consists of three sections .",
    "the first section explains in detail how the belief - free hindsight regrets and general testable implications in the paper can be derived for various parametric specifications of payoffs in social interactions models .",
    "the second section offers a multivariate version of mcdiarmid s inequality and its proof .",
    "the inequality is crucial for deriving a belief - free version of hindsight regret .",
    "the third section presents the full mathematical proofs of the results in the paper .",
    "in this section , we introduce formally a bayesian game that essentially defines the scope of the paper . assumptions relevant to econometric inference appears in section 4 .",
    "the game is played by @xmath0 players , where each player @xmath1 chooses an action from a common finite action set @xmath2 .    at the beginning of the game",
    ", the nature draws an outcome @xmath3 from a sample space @xmath4 which realizes the ( payoff ) type profile @xmath5for the @xmath0 players , where @xmath6 represents a finite dimensional type vector for player @xmath7 .",
    "let the distribution of @xmath8chosen by the nature be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "each player belongs to a group @xmath10 called _ information group _ , where players in the group @xmath11 commonly observe public signal @xmath12 . without losing generality ,",
    "we assume that @xmath12 is a subvector of @xmath13 for each player @xmath7 in information group @xmath11 . the types are conditionally independent given public signals @xmath12 .",
    "no player shares her type information with other players ( except for the public signal @xmath12 that is already shared ) . in many empirical examples",
    ", different information groups can be thought of either as separate games observed by the econometrician , or as large overlapping reference groups of players in a single game .",
    "( examples are given later . )",
    "once the nature draws a type profile @xmath14 that realizes to be @xmath15 , each player @xmath7 observes @xmath16 and forms a belief on @xmath14 .",
    "the belief is denoted by latexmath:[$q_{i}(\\cdot    each @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath18 is the _ objective probability _ that the econometrician uses to express the validity of his inference method , whereas @xmath19 is a _ subjective probability _ formed by player @xmath7 according to her prior and possibly through her higher order beliefs about other players beliefs . as aumann ( 1976 ) pointed out ,",
    "when @xmath9 belongs to common knowledge , we have @xmath20 for all @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( denoting the number of the players in @xmath7 , and @xmath23 the conditional distribution of @xmath14 given @xmath24 under @xmath9 ) so that the distinction between the objective and subjective probabilities is not necessary .",
    "here it is , as we are not making such an assumption .",
    "we introduce a conditional independence assumption for @xmath9 and @xmath19 s .",
    "assumption 1 ( conditional independence under objective and subjective probabilities ) : @xmath25 is conditionally independent given @xmath26 both under @xmath9 and under @xmath27 for all @xmath21 and all @xmath28 .    by assumption 1 ,",
    "any two players have types that are conditionally independent given the public signals @xmath29 according to both the objective and subjective probabilities .",
    "assumption 2 ( one - sided rational expectations on high probability events ) : there exists a small @xmath30 such that for any @xmath31 and any event @xmath32 such that @xmath33 for all @xmath28 , it is satisfied that @xmath34 for all @xmath28 .",
    "assumption 2 says that any event that a player believes strongly to occur is highly likely to occur according to the objective probability .",
    "this assumption imposes a limited ( one - sided )  version of rational expectations on the players beliefs on events that are believed to be highly likely by the players .",
    "the version is one - sided in the sense that a high probability event ( according to the nature s experiment ) is not necessarily viewed as a high probability event by each player .",
    "once the nature draws @xmath35 with distribution @xmath9 , each player @xmath7 , facing the other players choosing @xmath36 receives payoff @xmath37 from choosing @xmath38 so that the payoff of player @xmath7 depends only on the players actions and her own type .",
    "the latter condition is not as strong as it may seem at first , because the individual type vector @xmath13 contains a public signal @xmath12 as a subvector .",

    "one of the main theses of this paper is to develop an econometric inference procedure that does not require knowledge of ( and hence is robust against ) @xmath58 as long as the eventual beliefs @xmath19 over the payoff types @xmath13 s ( consistent with @xmath59 ) satisfy assumptions 1 and 2 . ]    instead of directly observing a strategy profile , the econometrician observes its realized action profile . given a pure strategy equilibrium @xmath42 , define@xmath60and let @xmath61 .",
    "the econometrician observes @xmath62 s and part of @xmath13 s .",
    "( we will specify the econometrician s observations later . ) the equation ( [ rf ] ) is a _ reduced form _ for @xmath62 .",

    "each group @xmath11 constitutes a large game with private information . for player @xmath7 in group @xmath11",
    ", we follow brock and durlauf ( 2001b ) ( see ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) there ) and consider either of the following two specifications of payoff functions:@xmath73or@xmath74where @xmath75 is a component depending only on @xmath76 , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the first specification expresses interaction between player @xmath7 s action ( @xmath79 ) and the average actions of the other players .",

    "the within - group correlation among the types @xmath13 is permitted through the public signal @xmath12 .",
    "more importantly the reference groups are allowed to be overlapping , so that each player @xmath7 may belong to multiple reference groups simultaneously and yet differently from many other players .",
    "for simplicity of exposition , we focus on the case with binary action space @xmath83 for the rest of the paper . the general case of a multinomial action set is dealt with in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we introduce the notion of hindsight regrets and establish its belief - free version .",
    "this version is used later to derive testable implications from the large game model .",

    "the compensation @xmath90 prevents player @xmath7 from switching from her action @xmath62 in equilibrium to action @xmath91 ( with large probability ) after the types of all the players are revealed to her .    for use in econometric inference , we seek to find a minimal compensation scheme that does not rely on beliefs of the players ( except through already given equilibrium @xmath43 . ) as we will see later , the quality of prediction and the econometrician s inference improves with the use of a tighter compensation scheme .",
    "a player s hindsight regret measures _ ex post _ loss of payoff due to not being able to observe the types of other players .",
    "the notion of hindsight regret is directly related to strategic interdependence among the players . to formally introduce measure of strategic interdependence",
    ", we first define a maximal variation of a real function .",
    "suppose that @xmath92 is a real - valued function on a set @xmath93 .",
    "then , we write @xmath94where the supremum is over all @xmath95 s in @xmath96 and over all @xmath97 s in @xmath96 such that @xmath97 is @xmath95 except for its @xmath98-th entry replaced by a certain element in @xmath99 .",

    "this paper focuses on a large bayesian game perspective for social interactions models , and develops an inference method that is robust to heterogeneous formation of beliefs among the players . utilizing the strategic interdependence among the players and the assumption of conditionally independent types ,",
    "this paper derives testable implications from the equilibrium constraints .",
    "the framework proposed in this paper may have limitations in some applications for several reasons .",
    "first , the framework assumes that the information groups are exogenously given in the beginning of the game .",
    "this does not cause any problem , if the current game s types satisfy the conditional independence assumption given any information used by the agents in the endogenous group formation that occurs prior to the game  however , this conditional independence assumption is violated when the agents observe the groups formed , before entering the current game .",
