    "observations at 850 , initially with the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) and subsequently with the max planck millimeter bolometer ( mambo ) , have revealed galaxies that are strong sources of dust emission but faint at visible wavelengths ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 , hughes et al .",

    "the scuba galaxy populations are important because they seem to represent the most luminous star - forming galaxies during the epoch when star formation rates were highest .",
    "the space density of submillimeter galaxies is orders of magnitude greater than that of @xmath2@xmath3  galaxies at low redshift ( blain et al .",
    "2002 ) , implying that strong evolution has greatly altered the submillimeter galaxy populations since @xmath4 . moreover , some or all of the scuba population may be the progenitors of today s massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "the stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and in the bulges of disk galaxies are old and tend to be metal rich . at high redshifts ,",
    "there ought to be a significant population of progenitor galaxies with star formation rates ( sfrs ) high enough to produce today s population of ellipticals and bulges ( lilly et al .",
    "no such population has been detected in deep optical surveys , but the scuba galaxies , or some of them , could represent the long - sought progenitors .",
    "understanding these so - called `` scuba galaxies '' and their place in cosmic evolution , however , requires complementary observations at other wavelengths and in particular some way to determine redshifts .",
    "observing scuba galaxies in visible light is difficult .",
    "the dust responsible for the submillimeter emission obscures the primary luminosity sources , making the scuba galaxies quite faint at visible wavelengths . even identifying the correct visible counterpart to a given scuba galaxy is difficult because of the large beamsize ( 14fwhm at 850  @xmath0 m ) of the james clerk maxwell telescope and other submillimeter facilities .",
    "the unavoidable result is that at visible and even near - infrared wavelengths , there are numerous potential counterparts in the scuba beam , and there is no easy way to decide which of the candidates is the true counterpart .",
    "one successful approach to finding counterparts has been to use radio interferometric observations to refine the scuba positions and thus select a specific visible object .",
    "chapman et al .  ( 2003 , 2005 ) , for example , have used this approach and have shown that radio - identified scuba galaxies have a median spectroscopic redshift of @xmath5 . however , about 1/3 of scuba sources are not detectable with current radio observations ( chapman et al .  2005 ) and could represent a distinct population .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile seeking alternate ways to identify counterparts .",
    "this contribution describes a new program to recover submm - selected galaxies in the mid - infrared , so as to exploit the advantages this passband offers for better identifications of the counterparts to these important objects .",
    "our submm sample is comprised of 23 scuba - detected objects in the 14@xmath1 field of the canada - uk deep submillimetre survey ( cudss ; lilly et al .  1999 ,",

    "we base our infrared counterpart search on the very deep 8.0  @xmath0 m _ spitzer _",
    "mosaic of the 14@xmath1 field .",
    "although the _ spitzer _ observations ( described below ) include coextensive observations at a number of passbands from 3.6 to 160  @xmath0 m , we use sources drawn specifically from the 8.0  @xmath0 m mosaic , for the following reasons .    first , 8.0  @xmath0 m observations sample rest - frame _ k_-band emission at typical scuba galaxy redshifts @xmath6",
    ". they are therefore much less affected than shorter - wavelength observations by extinction due to the dust known to be abundant in galaxies that are actively forming stars ( schmitt et al .  2006 ) .",
    "this rest - frame _ k_-band emission is also a good proxy for stellar mass ( cole et al .",
    "2001 ) ; it is therefore more sensitive to total star formation history than shorter - wavelength observations that are relatively more affected by recent star formation .",
    "second , high - redshift galaxies like those selected at submm wavelengths typically have red infrared colors that are well - suited to detection at 8.0  @xmath0 m ( egami et al .  2004 , huang et al .",
    "2004 , frayer et al .",
    "2004b ) , or at least they have red optical and near - infrared colors ( pope et al .",

    "2004a , borys et al .",
    "2004 , ivison et al .",

    "( 2004 ) but not at 3.6 or 4.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "in addition , although the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath0 m _ spitzer",
    "_ observations in the 14@xmath1 field are somewhat more sensitive than the 8.0  @xmath0 m mosaic , they tend to detect more of the blue , relatively numerous , low - redshift galaxies that are unrelated to the scuba - selected population .",
    "the resulting contamination problem is of course more severe at shorter wavelengths , e.g. , _ k_-band . at 8.0  @xmath0",
    "m we avoid to a great degree the problems of false associations that affect these other bands , without missing sources : all potential 8.0  @xmath0 m counterparts we considered are also detected in the 3.6  @xmath0 m mosaic .",
    "third , the 8.0  @xmath0 m mosaics themselves are very deep  down to a 5@xmath7 point source sensitivity of 5.8  @xmath0jy .",
    "we used two very simple models of star formation history to calculate that this depth is easily sufficient to detect typical scuba galaxies .",
    "both models ( one a constant star formation rate model , the other a burst ) give approximately equivalent results and suggest that at redshifts of @xmath8 the 8.0  @xmath0 m mosaics will detect star formation rates of @xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath11  yr@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "this is comfortably below the rates found for submm galaxies ( up to roughly @xmath13@xmath11  yr@xmath12 , e.g. , smail et al .",
    "2004 , yun & carilli 2002 , lilly et al .",
    "1999 ) , so we can expect _ a priori _ that their 8.0  @xmath0 m counterparts are detected in the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "this paper describes the _ spitzer _ observations , the 8.0  @xmath0 m counterpart identification procedure , and the inferences to be drawn from the panchromatic seds of infrared - selected scuba counterparts .",
    "a companion paper ( dye et al .  2006 ) describes the inverse process , whereby we determine the average submillimeter emission at the positions of the _ spitzer _ sources found in the field .",
    "the next section describes the _ spitzer_/irac and mips observations and presents infrared images at the known locations of the scuba galaxies .",
    "we then outline the scheme used to identify the most - likely infrared counterparts of the submillimeter galaxies in section  [ sec : ids ] .",
    "the infrared properties of the likely counterparts are analyzed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the irac ( fazio et al .  2004 ) observations were carried out as part of spitzer guaranteed time observing program number 8 to deeply image the extended groth strip ( egs ) . the first visit to the field was in 2003 december .",
    "the field was observed again during a second epoch in 2004 june at a different position angle . the irac exposures ( each of which covered a 512@xmath1412 field of view with @xmath15 pixels @xmath16 in size ) totaled 52 dithered 200  s exposures at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8  @xmath0 m , together with 208 dithered 50  s exposures taken concurrently at 8.0  @xmath0 m at all positions in a @xmath17 map .",
    "each dither cluster was separated from its neighbor by 290 , slightly less than the irac field of view . because the field was observed at position angles differing by roughly @xmath18 during the two epochs it was straightforward to remove most of the well - known instrumental artifacts ( multiplexer bleed , banding ) during mosaicing .",
    "the resulting point - source sensitivity was 24.0 , 24.0 , 21.9 , and 22.0 mag ( ab , 5@xmath7 ) , in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath0 m bands , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to flux density levels of 0.9 , 0.9 , 6.3 , and 5.8  @xmath0jy in the four irac bands .",
    "all magnitudes given in this work are on the ab system .",
    "sources in the irac mosaics were identified and extracted using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the software was configured with a 2.5@xmath7 detection threshold and a minimum object area of at least 5 pixels .",
    "the result was a band - merged photometric catalog of objects for all four irac wavelengths ; photometry was performed using 3   diameter apertures centered at the positions computed at 3.6  .",
    "all sources here are pointlike in the irac bands . to permit comparison with total magnitudes in the other bands , appropriate corrections were applied to obtain total magnitudes from the aperture magnitudes .",
    "the density of 8.0  @xmath0 m sources brighter than 5.8  @xmath0jy is roughly 11 per square arcminute .      the mips ( rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) observations of the egs were carried out on 2004 june 19 and 20 .",
    "the mips 24  @xmath0 m channel ( @xmath19 m ; @xmath20 m ) used a 128@xmath21128 si : as array with a pixel scale of 255 pixel@xmath12 , providing a field of view of @xmath2254 .",

    "the effective 70  @xmath0 m array size is therefore 32 @xmath2116 pixels , providing a field of view of 52@xmath2126 .",
    "the area was observed in scan map mode at slow rate with scan legs 24 long .",
    "this results in an integration time of 100 sec pixel@xmath12 per scan pass ( 10 frames@xmath2110 s ) at both 24 and 70  @xmath0 m . in scan mode images at these two wavelengths",
    "are obtained simultaneously .",
    "pairs of scan map observations , with a cross - scan offset of one full array ( 296 ) , were executed 6 times , with an offset of 21  between successive pairs .",
    "the effective integration time is therefore @xmath251500  s ( 12 passes ) at 24  @xmath0 m for locations near the long centerline of the strip , decreasing to @xmath25700  s 5  from the centerline . at 70  @xmath0 m",
    ", the integration time is only half as much due to the loss of half of the detector array .",
    "the final scan maps cover an area 2.4@xmath2110  with an integration time @xmath26 sec pixel@xmath12 . a smaller 2@xmath216  strip in the center , encompassing most of the cudss field , was covered with an integration time of 13001600 seconds .",
    "the data were reduced and mosaiced with the mips data analysis tool ( gordon et al .",
    "the 24  @xmath0 m scan images were resampled and mosaiced at half the original instrument pixel scale ( 125 ) while at 70  @xmath0 m the original pixel scale was preserved .",
    "the point spread functions in the mosaics have fwhms of 6  and 18  at 24 and 70  @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the resulting 5@xmath7 point source sensitivities are respectively 70  @xmath0jy and 7 mjy at 24 and 70  @xmath0 m .",
    "we have drawn from several pre - existing photometric catalogs in order to construct seds spanning as wide a wavelength range as possible for our counterparts .",
    "for the u , b , v , and i band photometry , we used the canada - france deep field survey ( mccracken et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter cfdf ) survey data .",
    "cfdf magnitudes are calculated within 2.5  diameter apertures .",
    "the 3@xmath7 cfdf limiting magnitudes are 27.71 , 26.23 , 25.98 , and 25.16 mag in u , b , v , and i , respectively . at r",

    "all visible and near - infrared sources considered here are small compared to the apertures used ; we therefore treat the aperture magnitudes as total magnitudes .",
    "two of the submillimeter galaxies ( 14.13 and 14.18 ) have _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) 15  @xmath0 m fluxes reported by flores et al .",

    "to avoid spurious sources we restrict our investigation to portions of the 14@xmath1 field covered by at least ten 8  @xmath0 m irac exposures . with this constraint",
    "the irac coverage allows counterpart identifications for 20 of the 23 scuba galaxies in this field .",
    "we identify irac counterparts of the scuba sources using a two - part approach , consisting first of a proximity search of the irac 8.0  @xmath0 m source catalog , followed by an examination of the infrared seds of all possible matches .",
    "we first use a metric based on 8.0  @xmath0 m brightness and positional coincidence to select likely counterparts .",
    "we restrict the search to irac objects within 10   of each scuba source , for several reasons .",
    "the primary motivation is to adopt a ( conservative ) value slightly larger than the @xmath33  uncertainty in the scuba positions , so as not to miss any true counterparts that might lie at relatively large separations , while simultaneously avoiding such a large value that we include a large number of unassociated foreground objects in the search .",
    "we find that a 10  search radius often selected just one ( or at most three ) candidates , and was therefore well - matched to our irac source density .",
    "based on the source surface density down to the 5@xmath7 limit of our survey , on average one irac 8  @xmath0 m source should randomly reside within each 10  radius search area .",

    "we applied a second criterion based on infrared color to refine the identifications .",
    "specifically , we made use of @xmath29-band photometry from webb et al .",
    "( 2003 ) as well as our own irac photometry to discriminate the most likely counterpart among multiple candidates . in doing so",
    ", we made one important assumption .",
    "we _ a priori _ assumed , based on spectroscopic studies ( chapman et al .  2003 , 2005 ) , that the true counterparts must reside at high redshift and that the seds must be consistent with this fact .",

    "although the @xmath57 statistics are not meaningful for individual sources , the sum of the @xmath57 statistics tabulated in table  [ 8micids ] is an estimate of the number of spurious identifications .",
    "we can not say which _ particular _ identifications are wrong , but the sums for the seven secure and the ten possible identifications are 0.61 and 2.61 , respectively , implying that the bulk of the errors apply to the latter subset , as one would expect . for the sample as a whole ,",
