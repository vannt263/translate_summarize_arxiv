    "<S> the overhauser field in gaas qds is several orders of magnitude larger than in si qds,@xcite and relevant energy scales have the same order of magnitude as for spin - orbit interactions,@xcite so without considering feedback mechanisms@xcite or echo sequences@xcite designed to increase dephasing times , the contribution from the overhauser field is the same as due to spin - orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the nuclear spin bath to qubit decoherence for a si qd can be drastically reduced by using isotopically purified @xmath99si samples.@xcite    we also find that @xmath100 is heavily dependent on the qd radius and confinement energy . @xmath101 and @xmath102 , </S>",
    "<S> so by doubling the confinement energy , or equivalently reducing the dot radius by a factor of @xmath103 , the dephasing time can be increased by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> dephasing times can also be increased by reducing the noise spectrum by going to lower temperatures since @xmath104 , or reducing sources of charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has recently been achieved by developing quantum dots in an undoped si / sige wafer,@xcite with results indicating that doped materials produce more charge noise sources via the 2deg and interface trapping sites . moreover , the rabi oscillation term is @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the dephasing rate for rtn is @xmath106 , while that due to @xmath3 noise is approximately @xmath107 . reducing @xmath78 </S>",

    "<S> @xmath154 acts as an ordinary ( diagonal ) susceptibility while the @xmath155 term gives the effect of precession about the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> we will not compute the effects of spin - orbit coupling and shape anisotropy in detail , since they depend on such unknowns as the microcrystallinity of the magnet . </S>",
    "<S> we only note that the resonance frequency @xmath134 of the magnet is strongly shifted by the restoring forces due to these effects . </S>",
