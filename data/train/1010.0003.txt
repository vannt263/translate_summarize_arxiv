    "the _ iras _ discovery of excess infrared radiation from many stars introduced a powerful new approach to study neighboring planetary systems .",
    "the dust that radiates in the infrared in these `` planetary debris systems '' is cleared away on timescales much shorter than the lifetime of the host stars , through processes such as radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag .",
    "its presence indicates the existence of larger bodies that replenish it through cascades of collisions @xcite .",
    "these bodies may be organized into large circumstellar structures analogous to the asteroid and kuiper belts in the solar system . like them , this extrasolar debris may be shepherded by the gravity of large planets . moreover , the dust location is a tracer of the non - gravitational drag and ejection forces , as well as of other effects such as sublimation if the dust approaches the star too closely .",
    "the structure of a relatively easily detected planetary debris system therefore reveals clues about the nature of the undetectable planetary system that sustains the debris .    although readily detected with cryogenic space infrared telescopes ( e.g. , _ iras , iso , spitzer , _ and _ herschel _ ) , only a small fraction of debris systems have well - understood structures .",
    "the small apertures and long operating wavelengths of these infrared telescopes provide inadequate resolution to resolve the majority of known debris systems well .",
    "scattered light imaging , particularly with _ hst _ , can only reach disks of high optical depth @xcite .",
    "ground - based imaging in the infrared can provide geometric information such as width , inclination and the presence of rings , warps or asymmetries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is sensitive only to high - surface - brightness structures .",
    "spectral data can provide information on the chemical composition and temperature of a debris disk ; however , it leaves the grain size and distance from the central star poorly determined , since both are derived from the grain optical properties .",
    "combining infrared spectral and imaging data is necessary to decode the information that debris disks can provide about planetary systems .",
    "different spectral regions preferentially probe different radial zones around the central star .",
    "simple arguments from the wien displacement law and radiative equilibrium show , for example , that 2 @xmath0 m measurements should be dominated by dust at @xmath21500 k , which would lie at several tenths of aus from a luminous a - type star .",
    "similarly , observations at 10 @xmath0 m will preferentially be sensitive to dust at a distance of 25 au , those at 24 @xmath0 m will be dominated by structures at 1020 au , and measurements at 70 @xmath0 m are best suited to probe in the @xmath2100 au region , which for most debris disks appears to be the outermost zone . a consistent combination of observations over the entire spectral range of 2 to 100 @xmath0 m is required to build a reasonably comprehensive model of a debris system .",
    "only a few systems have been modeled in this way , such as vega @xcite .    in this paper , we report observations of @xmath1 and _ o _ leo with the keck interferometer nuller ( kin ) , the bracewell infrared nulling cryostat ( blinc ) on the mmt , and with _ spitzer_. both kin and blinc are operated at 10  and trace material close to the star : kin has a resolution of 0012 and field of view of @xmath205 , which is complemented by blinc observations at a resolution of 02 and a field of view of 15 . _",
    "spitzer _ has a beam of 6  at 24  and 18  at 70 .",
    "together these three facilities can search for extended dust emission from 001 to @xmath210 , corresponding to 0.1100 au .",
    "we present the observations in section [ obs ] and general results in section [ results ] . in section [ analyses ]",
    "we discuss and analyze all available data of @xmath1 leo to set constraints on the circumstellar material .",
    "we then build a physical disk model based on these derived properties with assumed grain properties in section [ physical_model ] , followed by discussion of the results and a conclusion in section [ discussion ] and section [ conclusion ] .",
    "details about the method of nulling interferometry employed by blinc can be found in the appendix .",
    "briefly , the method involves delaying a beam from one aperture by half a wavelength and then overlapping it with a beam from a second aperture .",
    "the destructive interference that results can be arranged to suppress the light coming from the central star , allowing faint , extended emission to be observed .",
    "specifically , blinc is sensitive between radii of @xmath2012 and 08 .",
    "observations were carried out on 2008 march 27 at the 6.5 m mmt , located on mount hopkins , az .",
    "they consisted of taking ten 1-s frames on targets and calibrators with blinc set to interfere the apertures destructively .",
    "these measurements were followed by nodding the telescope 15  to take ten 1-s background frames .",
    "the process was then repeated with blinc set to interfere the apertures constructively . to maximize observing efficiency , 40-frame sets of destructive images",
    "were occasionally taken for @xmath1 and _ o _ leo , since these frames had low signal to noise , while constructive images were skipped .",
    "all of the observations reported here used an n - band filter , covering roughly 8 to 13 .",
    "table [ tab - mmtobs ] lists the number of frames taken for each star in both destructive and constructive modes of blinc , as well as the number of usable frames .",
    "we discarded the observed frames when the adaptive optics ( ao ) system broke lock in the middle of taking a dataset ( often due to wind gusts ) , and when blinc did not properly set the pathlength difference between beams .",
    "in addition , some frames taken at the end of observing @xmath1 and _ o _ leo , as well as all the frames taken on the calibrator star @xmath3 boo were adversely affected by weather conditions and were discarded .",
    "the results of comparing the weather - affected @xmath1 and _ o _ leo data with the @xmath3 boo data are consistent with the data presented here , but with substantially larger error bars .",

    "the 85 m baseline on kin provides the ability to detect circumstellar material in the n - band at angular separations of a few milliarcseconds from the primary star , within the kin field of view defined as an elliptical gaussian with fwhm of 05x044 @xcite .",
    "thus , the observations taken by kin are spatially complementary to the shorter baseline of blinc .",
    "each primary aperture at keck is further divided into two subapertures , with a baseline of 5 m , which are perpendicular to the long baseline .",

    "full details of the process are presented in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the important elements of the extraction technique .",
    "we begin with the droopres intermediate bcd product .",
    "background subtraction is accomplished by subtracting associated pairs of the 2d imaged spectra from the two nodded positions along the slit .",
    "this also eliminates stray light contamination and anomalous dark current signatures .",
    "bad pixels were replaced by interpolating the values in the surrounding 8 pixels .",
    "a 6.0 pixel fixed - width aperture was used in the extraction .",
    "we optimized the position of the extraction aperture for each order by fitting a sinc profile to the collapsed and normalized source profile in the dispersion direction .",
    "the _ irsfringe _",
    "package was used to remove low - level fringing for wavelengths @xmath520 .",
    "our custom extraction relies on relative spectral response functions ( rsrfs ) derived independently using stars from the feps legacy program free of any thermal excess emission @xcite .",
    "this rsrf assumes that the object is perfectly centered in the slit , but slight order mismatches are evident in the extracted spectra suggesting that the object was not centered .",
    "such an offset can induce a wavelength dependent curvature in the extracted spectra because of the fixed slit size and diffraction - limited psf .",
    "we employed an algorithm developed by j. bouwman & f. lahuis ( described in @xcite ) to correct for this offset .",
    "this process dramatically reduced the order offsets .",
    "however , a small residual offset remains between the sl1 and ll2 modules .",
    "the final absolute flux density calibration is derived by processing the ssc primary irs calibrators with the exact same algorithms as used for the feps stars @xcite and our program star . the uncertainty in the final absolute calibration is estimated to be @xmath210% .",

    "30 ( aor key 18010112 ) . in both the 3921152 and 18010112 datasets",
    ", the star was observed in full - frame mode with 30 s frame times and a 5-position small - scale dither pattern , for a total of 134 s integration time on - source in each band .",
    "while the 3921152 dataset contains data in all irac bands , images only at 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath0 m were acquired in 18010112 . in the 4306176 dataset",
    ", the star was observed in all bands in full frame mode with a 12 s frame time , repeated twice and with no dithers . due to the much shorter exposure and the absence of dithering ( limiting the spatial sampling of the star on the irac arrays ) ,",
    "we have discarded the 4306176 dataset . for the other two datasets we first created individual mosaics in each band starting from the bcd ( pipeline version s18.5.0 ) , using our custom post - bcd software iracproc @xcite , which is based on the ssc mosaiker mopex .",
    "[ fig - mmtnulls ]    as an initial test for dataset quality , a 16@xmath420 pixel box centered around the star ( which corresponds to 08@xmath41  on the sky ) is used to calculate the blinc instrument null .",
    "an elongated box is used instead of a circular aperture because the aperture for blinc is elliptical , making the psf of a star elliptical as well .",
    "the 16@xmath420 pixel box size ensures most ( though not necessarily all ) of the flux from the system is measured .",
    "figure [ fig - mmtnulls ] shows the average null for each set .",
    "since each set contains either 10 or 40 frames , error bars are determined by the deviation of the nulls in individual frames from the average null of the whole set .",
    "a filled point is considered good data that is used for further analysis , while a hollow data point is rejected due to weather .",
    "weather - rejected data occurred consistently for all stars when the telescope rotated into a substantial wind .",
    "this wind resulted in problems maintaining the telescope s ao system stability and , consequently , the null .",
    "for the good datasets , the calibration star @xmath1 gem has only small variations both within a set ( as indicated by the small error bars ) and from set to set .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 gem has a non - zero null demonstrates the necessity of having calibrator stars : minor movements of the star due to vibrations in the system and sky turbulence result in imperfect suppression ( chromatic effects on the null are minimized by a znse corrector in the non - shifted beam path ) . for the science stars ,",
    "there is greater variation than is seen for @xmath1 gem .",
    "this is primarily due to the science stars being much dimmer in the n - band , making them more sensitive to changes in background sky brightness . using weighted means to combine all the good measurements for each star",
    ", @xmath1 gem has an instrumental null of 3.19@xmath60.09% , _ o _ leo has 3.33@xmath60.28% and @xmath1 leo has 4.93@xmath60.29% . using the @xmath1 gem instrumental null as a baseline , we find source nulls of 0.14@xmath60.30% for _ o _ leo and 1.74@xmath60.30% for @xmath1 leo .",
    "this indicates that , within errors , _ o _ leo does not have resolved emission , while @xmath1 leo has resolved emission at 5@xmath7 significance .",
    "information pertaining to the variation of the null with respect to separation from the star can be gained by measuring the null within strips of increasing vertical separation from the center of the psf . due to the vertically changing transmission pattern of blinc ( illustrated in figure [ fig - tfs]a ) ,",
    "such strips are more natural to use than circular annuli .",
    "each dataset has its instrumental null calculated within 16@xmath43 pixel strips . for each separation , all good datasets for a star",
    "are combined via weighted means , which also provides the errors .",
    "the instrumental nulls for @xmath1 gem , _ o _ leo and @xmath1 leo are shown in figure [ fig - annnulls]a , while figure [ fig - annnulls]b shows the source null for _ o _ leo and @xmath1 leo .",
    "the x - axis is expressed as an angular separation from the center of the system , since 1 pixel has a width of 0054 .    in figure",
    "[ fig - annnulls]a , both @xmath1 gem and @xmath1 leo show an increase in the instrumental null beyond @xmath205 .",
    "this is likely caused by residuals from the adaptive optics systems , as well as imperfect beam alignment ( both of which are also evident in the fact that the calibrator star has a non - zero null ) .",
    "data for _ o _ leo only extend to 04 since beyond this separation , slow variations in sky background became comparable to the brightness of _ o _ leo itself when being imaged destructively . as a result , the destructive signal became lost in the noise .",
    "the source null of _ o _ leo ( figure [ fig - annnulls]b ) does not show evidence ( at a 3 @xmath7 confidence or greater ) of any resolved emission within 04 . for @xmath1 leo , however , an excess null is present out to a separation of at least 06 ( beyond which the error bars become too large to determine whether or not extended emission is present ) .",
    "it must be cautioned that while figure [ fig - annnulls ] provides evidence of extended emission , it can not be straightforwardly interpreted to be evidence for continuous emission from the inner limit of blinc out to at least 06 : the measured excess is a result of the incoming excess multiplied by the interferometer transmission function and convolved with the psf of the telescope aperture .",
    "modeling is necessary to interpret the figure , and is presented in section 4.3.2 .",
    "[ fig - annnulls ]      table [ tab - kinnull ] shows the calibrated nulls derived from the kin observations .",
    "the nulls in the table are an average of the observations taken on each night , and are analogous to the `` source nulls '' derived for the blinc data , with both having been calibrated using a calibrator star .",
    "the quoted errors are taken to be the larger of the external error for that date , or the average of the formal errors for all the scans on that date .",
    "the formal error is defined to be the scatter in the null within a given scan , while the external error is calculated as the standard deviation among all scans on a given night , divided by the square root of the number of scans ( additional information on these errors can be found in @xcite ) .",

    "implications of this result are discussed in section [ interferometric_model_bleo ] .",
    "the quality of data taken in the 2008 february run was low compared to the data taken in the later run , resulting in larger errors . due to the relatively low data quality",
    ", the 2008 february data were reduced manually ( i.e. , taking into account the relatively low percentage of data passing quality gates as well as some non - standard observing procedures ) , rather than using an automated pipeline .",
    "however , it should be noted that the result of both sets of reductions ( manual and pipeline ) agree within the errors .",
    "furthermore , both the february and april data are consistent and suggest no resolved circumstellar emission within the kin aperture .      for _ o _ leo , two of three sets of observations show evidence for resolved flux .",
    "the first set shows a negative null , which is non - physical , though the result is consistent with zero resolved emission within the errors .",
    "the last set of data , taken on 14 april , shows a non - zero null ; however , large errors result in this detection being only at a level of 1.8 @xmath7 , which we do not consider to be significant .",
    "the observations taken on 2008 february 17 yield a detection of resolved emission that can be considered robust .",
    "this is in contrast to the mmt results which show no resolved emission .",
    "however , interpretation of the kin resolved emission is more complicated as _ o _ leo is a double - lined spectroscopic binary @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling ( appendix b ) has determined that the resolved flux is consistent with emission from the stellar pair , which has a separation of about 4.5 mas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the null over time is consistent with the orbital solution calculated by @xcite .",
    "if binarity is indeed the source of the excess seen by kin , this explains why it was not observed by blinc as well : the separation between the stars is much too small to be detected by blinc .",
    "additional information on _ o _ leo can be found in the appendix .",
    "the photometry at 24  was obtained using aperture photometry on each of the five cluster data sets for both epochs .",
    "two aperture settings were used ( small : a radius of 623 with sky annulus between 1992 and 2988 and an aperture correction of 1.699 ; large : a radius of 1494 with sky annulus between 2988 and 4233 and an aperture correction of 1.142 ) .",
    "such aperture - corrected mips photometry generally agrees to within @xmath21% for a clean , non - saturated point source .",
    "the large aperture gives a total integrated flux density of 1623@xmath633 mjy ( 2% error assumed ) , which is @xmath22.5% higher than the small one ( this behavior is similar to that of the resolved disk of @xmath8  oph at 24  @xcite ) .",
    "this result suggests @xmath1  leo is slightly more extended than a true point source at 24 .",
    "therefore , we adopt the large aperture result as the final photometry in the 24  band .    however , the fwhm measurements of the source at 70  are consistent with it being a point source as compared to calibration stars that have a similar brightness at this wavelength .",
    "the 70  photometry was extracted using psf fitting , giving a total flux density of 711@xmath650 mjy ( 7% error assumed ) in the 70 band .",
    "the mips sed - mode data were extracted using an aperture of 5 native pixels ( @xmath250 ) in the spatial direction .",
    "the final mips sed - mode spectrum was further smoothed to match the resolution at the long - wavelength portion of the spectrum ( r=15 ) .",
    "the 160  observation needs additional attention to eliminate the filter leak contamination .",
    "the expected stellar photospheric brightness at 160  is @xmath226 mjy , resulting in a leak strength of @xmath2390 mjy ( @xmath215 times ) that is brighter than the expected disk brightness assuming its emission is blackbody - like .",
    "visual inspection of the 160  data confirms that the @xmath1 leo observation was mostly dominated by the ghost image ( off position ) .",
    "we used the 160  observation ( aor key 15572992 from pid 52 ) of achernar ( hd10144 , b3ve ) for the leak subtraction as both 160  observations were obtained in the same way ( dithered cluster position ) .",
    "a constant background value of 7.5 mjy  sr@xmath9 for achernar and of 10 mjy  sr@xmath9 for beta leo was taken out in each of the mosaics first .",
    "we then scaled the achernar data by a factor of 0.34 for subtraction , and a faint source appeared in the expected position of @xmath1 leo after the subtraction . because the background ( most due to instrument artifacts ) is not very uniform , the source is only weakly detected .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel variation of the observation suggests a point source 1-@xmath7 sensitivity of 30 mjy in this observation .",
    "we placed a 16  radius aperture at the position of the source to estimate the source brightness .",
    "after proper aperture correction @xcite , a flux density of 90 mjy is estimated .",
    "achernar is a nearby ( 42.75 pc ; @xcite ) fast rotating be star with a close ( 015 ) companion @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the companion has spectral type of a1v - a3v based on the near - infrared colors and contributes 3.3% of the combined photospheric emission .",

    "part of achernar s photosphere is subtracted off from the @xmath1 leo data for the leak subtraction . after correcting this",
    ", the faint source at the expected @xmath1 leo position has a flux density of 114 mjy .",
    "however , this value is a lower limit due to the uncertainty in scaling the leak subtraction . varying the scaling by @xmath610% results in a 30% change in the photometry .",
    "because of the difficulty of leak subtraction and low signal - to - noise of the data , we do not consider the source to be detected at 160 .",
    "the source brightness is likely within 114217 mjy .",

    ". moreover , due to its complex transmission function , kin observations are most sensitive to extended structures with a radius of less than @xmath21 au . from the errors during the april 2008 run , we adopt a 3 @xmath7 upper limit of 0.9% for the 10 @xmath0 m resolved emission , relative to the stellar photosphere .",
    "however , due to the complex transmission function of kin ( illustrated in figure [ fig - tfs]b in the appendix ) , this limit can not be directly converted into a flux .",
    "instead , we use the visibility modeling tool ( vmt ) provided by the nasa exoplanet science institute to test different excess configurations and determine how their simulated excesses compare to our limit .    one possible component to any excess detected by kin is the partially resolved photosphere of @xmath1 leo itself . if we take the stellar radius to be 1.7 @xmath12 and assume the star to be uniformly bright , this excess only amounts to 0.2% .",
    "while this is well below our detection threshold , it is a constant source of excess that needs to be considered when evaluating models that exceed our 0.9% upper limit .",
    "kin is most sensitive to emission between @xmath2 0.05 au and 1 au . a disk extending from 0 to 0.05 au would produce a null above the 0.9% limit only if it were brighter than 645 mjy , whereas a ring between 0.05 and 0.1 au would be detected if its flux is above 145 mjy at 10 @xmath0 m . a uniform disk model extending from 0 to 1 au will produce an excess greater than 0.9% for 10  fluxes above 110 mjy .",

    "the hot excess of @xmath1 leo detected by @xcite at 2 @xmath0 m is taken to be evidence for a hot inner ring . while there are several models presented in @xcite that can fit the hot excess , they focus on a ring model extending from 0.13 to 0.43 au .",
    "such a ring would be above kin s 3 @xmath7 limit if it has a 10  excess greater than 96 mjy . based on their 2  excess of 2.7 @xmath6 1.4 jy , a normal rayleigh - jeans falloff from this point",
    "would yield 108 mjy , which is somewhat above our 3 @xmath7 limit .",
    "thus , the kin null detection is not consistent with the @xcite result .",
    "there are several possibilities that could explain the discrepancy .",
    "it is possible that the excess is more compact than the suggested model .",
    "however , to avoid being detected in kin , the excess would have to be closer to the star than 0.1 au ( if it is located within a narrow ring ) or 0.15 au ( if it is part of a continuous disk extending into the star ) .",
    "in either case , much of the disk would be located within the sublimation radius for amorphous grains of 0.12 au @xcite , making the possibility of such a compact disk unlikely .",
    "more likely , the disagreement between kin and @xcite suggests that the source of this hot emission is variable , has a color bluer than a normal star ( rayleigh - jeans ) , or the emission level is smaller than the reported value .      to compare physical models of the @xmath1 leo disk to the blinc data ( shown in figure [ fig - annnulls ] ) , a program was created to take an input disk geometry , interfere it , convolve it with the aperture psf and pass it through the same data reduction pipeline used on real images . because of the limited datapoints , these calculations assumed an optically and geometrically thin disk composed of blackbody grains .",
    "the dust in the disk was given an optical depth of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a brightness scaling constant and @xmath38 is the power law index . assuming a sharp inner ( @xmath39 ) and outer ( @xmath40 ) cutoff beyond which @xmath41 is zero , there were four variables : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we first compare the possible disk geometries from the interferometry , using the integrated excess from the _ spitzer _ observations as an additional constraint .",
    "figure [ fig - bcontmod ] shows a set of disk geometries compared to the source null of @xmath1 leo . in this and",
    "similar figures it should be noted that the hump located near 08 does not correspond to a physical excess at that separation from the star ; rather , it is a feature relating to the psf of the aperture .",
    "the disk geometries in figure [ fig - bcontmod ] use different brightness scaling constants , @xmath37 , and all assume a uniform ( @xmath38=0 ) disk that extends from 0 au to 10 au . for a uniform disk , the values of @xmath37 are equivalent to the optical depth of the disk .",
    "disk geometries with @xmath42 au do not differ significantly from these simulations , since the blinc data are not sensitive outside this radius .",
    "these models are thus good approximations of continuous disks that extend into the outer regions imaged by _ spitzer_. the best fit for such a continuous disk simulation is given as a dotted line in figure [ fig - bcontmod ] , and corresponds to an optical depth of 2.25@xmath43 .",
    "this geometry has a reduced @xmath44@xmath45 of 4.2 , making it a relatively poor fit .",
    "more importantly , such a disk is required to have a flux density of 0.515 jy at 10.5  ( or @xmath29% excess emission above the stellar photosphere ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the sed - measured excess shown in figure [ sed ] and the irs excess spectrum in figure [ irs_excess ] .",
    "we therefore rule out a continuous disk extending from 0 au to 10 au or beyond as being the source of the excesses measured by blinc .",
    "[ fig - bcontmod ]    better fits can be achieved by varying the inner and outer radii .",
    "the best possible fits for both a uniform and an inverse ( @xmath46 ) disk are with a ring extending from 1 to 2 au . in both models",
    "there is a reduced @xmath44@xmath45 of around 0.7 .",
    "however , these models require the disk to be even brighter at 10.5  than the best fit continuous disk models , and thus are also inconsistent with our other observations . in order to bring the models more in line with the irs data ,",
    "we consider only those that are at most 0.30 jy in brightness ( @xmath25% of the photosphere ) .",
    "doing so , we find the best fit models to have reduced @xmath44@xmath45 of around 2 .",
    "the models are shown in figure [ fig - bbestmod ] .",
    "one model assumes a uniform disk and the other assumes an inverse disk .",
    "both of these model disks have an inner radius of 2 au and a width of less than 1 au ( although the best fit uniform disk is slightly more extended than the best fit inverse disk ) .",
    "both disks have a flux of 0.30 jy at 10.5 with the uniform disk having a slightly better reduced @xmath44@xmath45 ( @xmath44@xmath45 = 1.9 ) than the inverse disk ( @xmath44@xmath45 = 2.0 ) .",
    "the uniform disk has an optical depth of 1.04@xmath47 while the inverse disk has an optical depth of 1.50@xmath47 at @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig - bbestmod ]    overall , both uniform and inverse models are similar with regards to their quality of fit .",
    "the similarity of these two cases shows that the best fit is insensitive to the power law index when considering thin rings .",
    "also , as noted above , better fits can be found if we allow for higher fluxes ; however , such brighter disks would be inconsistent with other data .",
    "while the above models are the best fits to the blinc data , @xmath39 and @xmath40 have some flexibility : @xmath40 can be extended to 4 au before the reduced @xmath44@xmath45 exceeds 3 .",
    "similarly , disks that have brightness less than 0.30 jy and reduced @xmath44@xmath45 less than 3 exist for models with @xmath39 as small as 1 au . reducing @xmath39 to less than this extends the disk to regions where blinc strongly suppresses emission and is thus insensitive , resulting in a rapidly increasing disk brightness while minimally affecting the quality of fit .",
    "however , kin becomes increasingly sensitive to regions inside of @xmath22 au , which restricts the amount of excess that can be there and still result in a null detection by kin .",
    "disk widths larger than 1.5 au result in poor fits ( @xmath44@xmath45 greater than 3 ) .",
    "however , disks narrower than 1 au do not strongly degrade the fit ; at widths less than @xmath20.5 au , the resolution of blinc makes the models degenerate in brightness and width .    with these possible geometries ,",
    "we look in more detail at the flux constraints from the interferometry . based on the null analysis in section 3.1 , the excess was found to be 1.74@xmath60.30% over the photosphere .",
    "if we take the photosphere to be 6.3 jy at 10.5 , this excess would be 0.11@xmath60.02 jy",
    ". however , for a near face - on disk , the interference pattern will suppress at least half of the light , and possibly more depending on the location of the dust , which sets a lower limit of 0.22 @xmath6 0.04 jy on the dust emission in this ring .",
    "this is consistent with our uniform and inverse model simulations that find that any disk with a flux fainter than 0.2 jy would result in poor fits .",
    "taking into consideration the irac 8 @xmath0 m and irs data , the maximum brightness for this blinc component is 0.3 jy .",
    "we have used the vmt to model what level of signal , if any , kin would see from this belt .",
    "we find that a 0.3 jy belt extending from 2 to 3 au creates a null in kin of -0.2% .",
    "this negative null is likely due to the complex transmission pattern of kin ( see figure [ fig - tfs]b in the appendix ) and the fact that the belt would lie in the sidelobes of this pattern . combined with the partially resolved photosphere of @xmath1 leo , the net signal from the system is 0% . for a belt that is less than 0.3 jy in brightness , the combined null approaches 0.2% ( as we would expect ) . for a belt that has an inner radius as small as 1 au , the predicted null would still not be large enough to exceed the 0.9% limit that has been established .",
    "so , for belts less than 0.3 jy , the resulting nulls predicted by the vmt are fully consistent with our kin data . in summary , using the simple models outlined above we then conclude that the excess component detected by blinc is consistent with a narrow ring of 23 au with a brightness of 0.25@xmath60.05 jy at 10.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "we now build a physical model to probe the disk properties ( such as the extension and total dust mass ) based on all the information derived from interferometric and _ spitzer _ excesses , with assumed grain properties .",
    "we start with a simple disk with one component in order to minimize the free parameters being fit to the global excess sed ; we then add an additional component required by the spatial constraint provided by the interferometric data .",
    "we assume a simple , geometrically - thin ( 1-d ) debris disk where the central star is the only heating source in the system ( optically thin ) .",
    "the dust is distributed radially from the inner radius ( @xmath39 ) to the outer radius ( @xmath40 ) , and governed by a power law of radius @xmath48 for the surface number density with an index @xmath38 ( @xmath49 , @xmath38 = 0 is a disk with constant surface density expected from a poynting - robertson drag dominated disk ; while @xmath38 = 1 is a disk expected from grains ejected out of the system by radiation pressure ) .",
    "we further assume that the grains in the disk have a uniform size distribution at all radii , following a power - law with minimum cutoff radius of @xmath50 , maximum cutoff radius of @xmath51 , and a power index of @xmath52 = 3.5 ( @xmath53 ) , consistent with grains generated in theoretical collisional equilibrium .",
    "no obvious dust mineralogical features are seen in the irs spectrum to favor a specific dust composition ; therefore , we adopt the grain properties ( size - dependent absorption @xmath54 and scattering @xmath55 ) of astronomical silicates @xcite with an assumed grain density of 2.5 g  @xmath56 .",
    "we then compute the dust temperature as a function of the grain size , the incident stellar radiation ( best - fit kurucz model ) , and the distance @xmath48 based on balancing the energy between absorption and emission by the dust ( scattering is ignored in this simple model ) .",

    "our goal is to have the simplest model for the warm belt that can fit the global sed when combined with the emission from the main belt , and with a null level computed from the model image that matches the blinc data . given the high dust temperatures in the 23 au belt , we adopted grain properties for amorphous carbon grains ( density of 1.85 g @xmath56 , @xcite ) with a radius of 0.5 .",

    "nulling interferometry allows light from a central source to be suppressed , while not affecting surrounding , extended emission . consequently , fainter sources surrounding a central source can be more easily observed .",

    "a transmission pattern is created with the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the interferometer baseline , @xmath80 is the wavelength of light and @xmath81 is the vertical angular distance from the central null .",
    "figure [ fig - tfs]a shows the transmission pattern created by blinc for the simplified case of uniform contribution from 8 to 13 . using this pattern , the flux from the central star",
    "is strongly suppressed while extended structures , such as debris disks , are much less affected @xcite . with a baseline of 4 m ( which is the separation of the subapertures used on the mmt ) , the first constructive peak occurs at 025 ; however , blinc is sensitive to emission outwards of 012 , where the transmission is neither destructive nor constructive .",
    "this system is ideal for probing regions containing warm disks around nearby main sequence stars .",
    "moreover , using the adaptive optics systems on the mmt , we can obtain stable , diffraction limited images .",
    "this allows the pathlength between beams to remain fixed instead of varying randomly .",
    "such random variations would require less efficient techniques , such as lucky imaging, to extract useful data @xcite .",
    "[ fig - tfs ]    to set the appropriate pathlength difference between beams that will achieve destructive or constructive interference , prior to each dataset a pair of calibrator frames is taken .",
    "a calibrator frame consists of changing the pathlength to an intermediate distance ( neither constructive nor destructive ) . for each calibrator pair",
    ", one frame is taken on the shortward side of the optimal pathlength and the other on the longward side .",
    "the observed brightness of the star for these calibrator frames is directly proportional to the transmissive efficiency ; when blinc is properly set to destructive interference , the brightness of the star will be the same for both calibrator frames ( @xmath82 = @xmath83 ) .",
    "if the pathlength difference is not properly set for destructive interference , the calibrator frames will be different brightnesses . to correct blinc ,",
    "the optimal pathlength can be approximated using @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant gain factor which has been set experimentally using an artificial source .",
    "while this procedure will set blinc to optimal destructive interference for moderate offsets , if the initial offset is too large , blinc may settle into a side null .",
    "these nulls are 15 - 20% worse than the central null while variations from dataset to dataset are much smaller ( typically several percent , see figure [ fig - mmtnulls ] ) .",
    "consequently , data taken at the incorrect null are easily identified and removed from the overall dataset .    in order to extract meaningful information ,",
    "sky subtracted constructive and destructive images of both the science star and a calibrator star need to be obtained .",
    "the `` instrumental null '' is the null measured by the instrument and is the ratio of a destructive image to a constructive image for a given target .",
    "the constructive image allows for the normalization of destructive images to a baseline , in this case the brightness of the central star . for a monochromatic point source perfectly centered in the image ,",
    "this ratio would be zero , since the target would be perfectly nulled ; however , in actual observations , stars will only be incompletely suppressed , typically yielding a ratio of @xmath2 3% , with some amount of variation from frame to frame .",
    "thus a calibrator star is needed to set a baseline with which to compare a science star ( in this case , @xmath1 and o leo ) . for such science stars ,",
    "the `` source null '' refers to the instrument null of the science star subtracted by the instrument null of a calibrator star .",
    "if the science star is unresolved ( i.e. a point source ) , then the source null will be zero within the error bars . if the star is resolved , then the source null will be positive . by calculating the source null at different size scales , spatial information on the object can be gained .",
    "we use a simple model , created with the visibility modeling tool ( vmt ) provided by the nasa exoplanet science institute .",
    "the tool allows one to create a hypothetical system , consisting of any number of point sources , disks and rings that may be either uniform or gaussian , and predicts the observational signature if the hypothetical system were to be observed by kin .",

    "values calculated for the expected and observed nulls are shown in table [ tab - omileo_nulls ] . comparing the two",
    ", we can say that the predicted and actual data are marginally consistent , indicating little evidence for additional extended emission",
    ".      given the behavior of the null with respect to time as compared to the detailed orbital parameters determined by @xcite , we can conclude that the non - zero nulls detected by our kin observations are likely due to the stellar components being resolved , with no evidence for excess emission from warm dust .",

    "if , on the other hand , the disk were oriented parallel to the interference pattern , a brighter disk could be present without being detected . for this sub - optimal orientation ,",
    "an upper limit of 0.31 jy can be placed on the disk .        _",

    "spitzer_. @xcite reported a 24 and 70 @xmath0 m excess ratios for _ o _ leo of 1.23 and 1.30 respectively , suggesting the presence of circumbinary dust .",
    "they derived a dust temperature of 815 k with a minimum radius of 0.85 au ( 002 ) .",
    "although too concentrated to be detectable by blinc , such a disk would be odds with the lack of detection by kin .",
    "however , trilling et al s analysis appears to be based on saturated 2mass measurements for _ o _ leo , from which they derive a k - band magnitude of 2.58 @xmath6 0.15 .",
    "if instead we use johnson k - band photometry @xcite converted to a 2mass k@xmath96 magnitude , we find that _ o _ leo is 2.39 @xmath6 @xmath730.07 , 0.19 magnitudes brighter than calculated by trilling et al .",
    "since the 2mass data is saturated for _ o _ leo , we believe this johnson k - magnitude to be a better measurement . using this magnitude ,",
    "our model fitting predicts flux densities of 816 and 89.5 mjy ( or ratios of 1.00 and 1.06 to the stellar photosphere ) respectively at 24 and 70 .",
    "the mips measurements reported by @xcite then indicate no excess at 24 @xmath0 m above the @xmath2 6% ( 2-@xmath7 ) level ( and above 15% at 70 @xmath0 m ) .",
