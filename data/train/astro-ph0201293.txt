    "our _ chandra _ flux for gro j174428 is much lower than the critical flux limit given by cui ( 1997 ) strongly suggesting that the source was in the propeller regime during our observation .",
    "therefore , accretion on to the surface of the neutron star is not likely to be the cause behind the quiescent x - ray emission of gro j174428 .",
    "similar conclusions were also reached for the quiescent emission from the transient x - ray pulsars a 0535 + 26 ( negueruela et al .",
    "2000 ) and 4u 0155 + 63 ( campana et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a possible mechanism to produce the observed quiescent x - rays when the source is in the propeller regime might be accretion down to the magnetospheric radius @xmath45 ( e.g. , stella et al .",
    "1994 ; corbet 1996 ; campana et al .",
    "1998b ) , which is approximately give by @xmath46 , in which @xmath47 is the neutron star mass , @xmath48 the neutron star magnetic moment , and @xmath49 the accretion rate .",
    "the luminosity produced will be @xmath50 . using our measured luminosity and the magnetic field strength found by cui ( 1997 ; @xmath51 gauss ) , then @xmath52 g s@xmath8 and @xmath53 cm .",
    "this radius is larger than the corotation radius @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 the neutron star spin period ) , which is @xmath56 cm for gro j174428 , and therefore it fulfills the condition that the source should be in the propeller regime .",
    "although a rough estimate , it indicates that accretion down to the magnetospheric radius might be able to produce the quiescent x - ray luminosity of gro j174428 .",
    "however , contributions to the x - ray luminosity might also come from several other mechanisms , like accretion onto the neutron star surface ( possibly on localized areas such as the magnetic poles ) due to the leakage of matter through the magnetospheric barrier .",
    "another contribution to the quiescent x - ray emission will be the thermal x - ray emission from the neutron star surface which should give a rock bottom lower limit on the x - ray luminosity . due to the low statistics of our data and the high column density towards gro j174428 , we are not able to accurately probe such a thermal component .",
    "however , if the temperature of the thermal component is similar to what has been observed for the quiescent spectra of the non - pulsating neutron star transients , then at least the detected emission in our _ chandra _ observation is mostly due to an another component , which has its origin probably in one of the above discussed mechanisms .",
    "progress in our understanding of the quiescent x - ray emission can be made for gro j174428 by obtaining longer _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ observations of this source .",
    "such observations will be able to constrain its luminosity and spectral shape much better than we are able to due with the present _ chandra _ data and will determine if the quiescent spectrum of gro j174428 is similar to that of the quiescent non - pulsating systems , or that a fundamental difference is present . detecting the pulsations in observations with sufficient time resolution will also constrain the mechanisms for the quiescent x - rays in this system . detecting the pulsations in quiescence",
    "would also unambiguously proof that the detected source is gro j174428 .    _ note added in manuscript : _",
