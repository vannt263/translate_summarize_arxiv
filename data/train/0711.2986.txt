    "when calculating cross - sections for scattering processes involving hadronic particles one requires detailed knowledge of the input parton distributions .",
    "the uncertainties in the latter propagate into the uncertainties on the former , and are often significant and sometimes dominant .",
    "the parton distributions can be derived within qcd using the factorization theorem , i.e. the cross - section for a physical cross - section at the lhc can be written in the factorised form @xmath0 up to small corrections , where @xmath1 represents some arbitrary process with hard scale ( e.g. particle mass , jet @xmath2 , ... ) .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath3 describing the hard scattering process of the two incoming partons are process dependent but calculable as a power - series in @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 are the parton distributions  heuristically the probability of finding a parton of type @xmath6 carrying a fraction @xmath7 of the momentum of the proton .",
    "the parton distributions are not calculable from first principles , but evolve with @xmath8 in a perturbative manner governed by the splitting functions @xmath9 which are calculable order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "hence , once measured at one scale the distributions can be predicted at other scales .    in this article i will briefly review the extraction of the parton distributions and the resulting uncertainties .",
    "this is an update of a previous article in this series of workshops @xcite , so i will concentrate on new developments .",
    "a full discussion of fitting procedures and uncertainties due to experimental errors on the input data is found in @xcite , but i will very briefly restate the essentials , including some updates .",
    "there are a variety of sets of parton distributions which are obtained by a comparison to all available data ( so - called global fits ) @xcite or to smaller subsets of mainly structure function data @xcite , sometimes only in the nonsinglet sector @xcite .",
    "all follow the same general principle .",
    "the fit usually proceeds by starting the parton evolution at a low scale @xmath10 and evolving partons upwards ( sometimes also downwards ) using fixed order evolution equations .",
    "the default has long been next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , but the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) splitting functions were recently calculated @xcite , and sets of nnlo distributions are also available @xcite . in principle , there are 11 different parton distributions ( assuming isospin symmetry and ignoring the top quark )  the 5 quarks , up , down , strange , charm , and bottom and their antiquarks , and the gluon distribution . until recently these",
    "were not all considered independent , but there is now some evidence for asymmetry between strange quarks and antiquarks @xcite , and moreover all quarks evolve slightly differently from their antiquarks due to evolution effects which begin at nnlo . however , in practice @xmath11 , so the heavy parton distributions are usually determined perturbatively and there are 7 independent input parton sets , each parameterised in a particular form , e.g. @xmath12 the partons are constrained by a number of sum rules : i.e. conservation of the number of valence up and down quarks , zero number asymmetry for the other quarks and the conservation of the momentum carried by partons .",
    "the last is an important constraint on the form of the gluon , which is only probed indirectly . in",
    "determining partons one needs to consider that not only are there many different distributions , but there is also a wide distribution of @xmath7 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "one needs many different types of experiment for full determination , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "for instance , the mrst ( now mstw @xcite ) group use 29 different types of data set .",
    "the quality of the fit is determined by the @xmath15 of the fit to data , which may be calculated in various ways .",
    "the simplest is to add statistical and systematic errors in quadrature , which ignores correlations between data points , but is sometimes quite effective .",
    "also , the information on the data often means that only this method is available .",
    "more properly one uses the full covariance matrix which is constructed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 runs over each source of correlated systematic error , @xmath18 are the correlation coefficients , @xmath19 is the number of data points , @xmath20 is the measurement and @xmath21 is the theoretical prediction depending on parton input parameters @xmath22 . an alternative that produces identical results",
    "if the errors are small is to incorporate the correlated errors into the theory prediction @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the one - sigma correlated error for point @xmath6 .",
    "one can solve analytically for the @xmath25 @xcite .     and",
    "the uncertainty using @xmath26 for each data set in the cteq fit ( left ) and the @xmath27 confidence limits for each data set as a function of @xmath28 for one particular eigenvector , title=\"fig : \" ]   and the uncertainty using @xmath26 for each data set in the cteq fit ( left ) and the @xmath27 confidence limits for each data set as a function of @xmath28 for one particular eigenvector , title=\"fig : \" ]    having defined the fit quality there are a number of different approaches for obtaining parton uncertainties .",
    "the most common is the hessian ( error matrix ) approach .",
    "one defines the hessian matrix by @xmath29 one can then use the standard formula for linear error propagation : @xmath30 this has been used to find partons with errors by @xmath31 @xcite and alekhin @xcite . in practice it is problematic due to extreme variations in @xmath32 in different directions in parameter space .",
    "this is improved by finding and rescaling the eigenvectors of @xmath33 , a method developed by cteq @xcite , and now used by most groups .",
    "the uncertainty on a physical quantity is @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are pdf sets displaced along eigenvector directions by the given @xmath32 .",
    "one can also investigate the uncertainty on a given physical quantity using the lagrange multiplier method , first suggested by cteq @xcite and also used by mrst @xcite .",
    "one performs the global fit while constraining the value of some physical quantity , i.e. minimise @xmath37 for various values of @xmath38 .",
    "this gives the set of best fits for particular values of the parameter @xmath39 without relying on the quadratic approximation for @xmath40 , but has to be done anew for each quantity .    in each approach there",
    "is uncertainty in choosing the `` correct '' @xmath32 . in principle",
    "this should be one unit , but given the complications of a full global fit this gives unrealistically small uncertainties .",
    "this can be seen in the left of fig .",
    "[ cteq1sigma ] where the variation in the predictions for @xmath41 using @xmath42 for each data set has an extremely wide scatter compared to the uncertainty .",
    "cteq choose @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "[ cteq1sigma ] . as",
    "one sees , a couple of sets may be some way beyond their @xmath27 confidence limit for @xmath45 .",
    "the mrst / mstw group chooses @xmath46 to represent the @xmath27 confidence limit for the fit .",
    "other groups with much smaller data sets and fewer complications still use @xmath26 .",
    "distributions , title=\"fig : \" ]   distributions , title=\"fig : \" ]    there are other approaches to finding the uncertainties . in the offset method",
    "the best fit is obtained by minimising the @xmath15 using only uncorrelated errors .",
    "the systematic errors on the parton parameters @xmath47 are determined by letting each @xmath48 and adding the deviations in quadrature .",
    "this method was used in early h1 fits @xcite and by early zeus fits @xcite , but is uncommon now .",
    "there is also the statistical approach used by neural network group @xcite .",
    "here one constructs a set of monte carlo replicas @xmath49 of the original data set @xmath50 which gives a representation of @xmath51 $ ] at points @xmath52 .",
    "then one trains a neural network for the parton distribution function on each replica , obtaining a representation of the pdfs @xmath53 .",
    "the set of neural nets is a representation of the probability density ",
    "i.e. the mean @xmath54 and deviation @xmath55 of an observable @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 , \\quad \\sigma_o^2 = \\frac { 1}{n_{rep } } \\sum_{1}^{n_{rep}}(o[q_i^{(net)(k)}]-\\mu_o)^2.\\ ] ] one can incorporate full information about measurements and their error correlations in the distribution of @xmath50 .",
    "this is does not rely on the approximation of linear propagation of errors but is more complicated and time intensive .",
    "it is currently done for the nonsinglet sector only .",
    "in recent years there has been a great deal of work on the correct and complete inclusion of the experimental errors on the data when extracting the partons and their uncertainties . however , to obtain a complete estimate of errors , one also needs to consider the effect of the decisions and assumptions made when performing the fit , e.g. cuts made on the data , data sets fit and parameterization for the input sets .",
    "distribution with the corresponding mrst2001e partons , title=\"fig : \" ]   distribution with the corresponding mrst2001e partons , title=\"fig : \" ]    as an exercise for the hera - lhc @xcite workshop , partons were produced from fits to some sets of structure function data for @xmath58 using a common form of parton inputs at @xmath59 .",
    "partons were obtained using the rigorous treatment of all systematic errors ( labelled alekhin ) and using the simple quadratures approach ( labelled mrst ) , both using @xmath26 to define the limits of uncertainty .",
    "this benchmark test is clearly a very conservative approach to fitting that should give reasonable partons with bigger than normal uncertainties . as seen in fig .",
    "[ glucompsa ] there are small differences in the central values and similar errors , i.e. the two sets are fairly consistent .",
    "it is more interesting to compare the hera - lhc benchmark partons to partons obtained from a global fit @xcite , where the uncertainty is determined using @xmath60 .",

    "moreover , @xmath62 from the benchmark fit compared to @xmath63 .",
    "something is clearly seriously wrong in one of these analyses , and indeed partons from the benchmark fit fail when compared to most data sets not included .",
    "this implies that partons should be constrained by all possible reliable data .    ]",
    "the benchmark partons above are not a realistic set of partons , but similar examples are found when comparing different sets of published parton distributions .",
    "for example , the valence quarks extracted from the nonsinglet analysis in @xcite ( see figs . 9 and 10 ) are different from a variety of alternatives by much more than the uncertainties . indeed ,",
    "various gluon distributions , all obtained by fitting to small @xmath7 hera data @xcite are very different despite what is meant to be the main constraint on the data being the same in each case .",
    "it is particularly illustrative to look at the difference in the high-@xmath7 gluons of mrst and alekhin in fig .",
    "[ glualcomph ] .",
    "this is for nnlo , but is similar at nlo .",
    "here the difference above @xmath64 is a large factor , and very much bigger than each uncertainty ( calculated using @xmath42 for alekhin and @xmath65 for mrst . )",
    "it seems that the hera data require a gluon distribution for the very best fit which is incompatible with the tevatron jet data @xcite , and the standard error analysis does not accommodate this . as a further point , at nnlo one of the few hard cross - sections required in a global fit which is not fully known",
    "is that for the jet cross - section . it might be argued that one should leave the data out rather than rely on the nlo hard cross - section , as done by mrst",
    ". however , this correction is very likely to be @xmath66 , whereas the change in the gluon distribution if the data are left out can be @xmath67 .",
    "this implies , to the author at least , that it is better to include a data set relying on a slight approximation than to leave it out and obtain partons which are completely incompatible with it .",
    "( right),title=\"fig : \" ] ( right),title=\"fig : \" ]    even when similar data sets are fit , there can still be significant differences in parton distributions and their predictions.the prediction for @xmath41 at nlo at the lhc using cteq6.5 partons is @xmath68 nb and using mrst04 partons is @xmath69 nb .",
    "this is despite the rather similar data sets and procedures used in the two fits .",
    "the different predictions are easily explained by looking at the left of fig .",
    "[ hessratg ] .",
    "the cteq gluon is much bigger than mrst at small @xmath7 and drives quark evolution to be larger .",
    "this difference is not fully understood but is probably partially due to the fact the mrst have lower @xmath70 cuts on the structure function data , and also due to the different input parameterisations for the gluon .",
    "mrst allow their gluon to be negative at small @xmath7 at input ( @xmath71 ) while the cteq gluon is positive at small @xmath7 input ( @xmath72 ) , but is very small indeed .",
    "( further analysis suggests a slightly negative input gluon is preferred , but only barely @xcite so the freedom is not introduced . )",
    "the parameterization can have an even more dramatic effect on the uncertainty than on the central value .",
    "the uncertainties on the gluon distributions for mrst , cteq and alekhin are shown in the right of fig .",
    "[ hessratg ] .",
    "one would expect the uncertainty to increase significantly at very small @xmath7 as constraints die away .",
    "this happens for the mrst gluon .",
    "the alekhin gluon does not have as much freedom , but is input at higher scales and behaves like @xmath73 at small @xmath7 .",
    "the uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in @xmath38 ( the situation is similar for zeus and h1 partons ) .",
    "the cteq input gluon behaves like @xmath74 at small @xmath7 where @xmath38 is large and positive .",
    "the small-@xmath7 input gluon is tiny and has a very small absolute error . at higher",
    "@xmath70 all the uncertainty is due to evolution driven by the higher-@xmath7 , well - determined gluon .",
    "the very small @xmath7 gluon no more uncertain than at @xmath75 .    ]",
    "another important source of uncertainty only now becoming clear is due to the strange distribution . until recently this",
    "was taken to be a fixed and constant fraction of the total sea quark distribution .",
    "this did not allow any intrinsic uncertainty on the strange quark .",
    "it is now being fit more directly by comparison to dimuon data in neutrino scattering @xcite . in the mstw",
    "fits @xcite this results in an increased uncertainty on all sea quarks since allowing the strange to vary independently gives the up and down quarks more freedom .",
    "cteq have produced specific parton sets with fits to the strange quark @xcite , and in fig .",
    "[ cteqwpc ] we see predictions from these for production of @xmath76 .",
    "cteqs0 represents the best fit when the strange is fit directly .",
    "worryingly , this can be outside the uncertainty band for the default set .",
    "even if we had an unambiguous definition for the parameterization and the data sets and cuts used , there would still be additional uncertainties due to the limited accuracy of the theoretical calculations .",
    "the sources of theoretical error include higher twist at low scales and higher orders in @xmath77 , and it now seems likely that there may be sizable corrections from higher order electroweak corrections at the lhc ( see e.g. @xcite ) , due to @xmath78 terms in the expansion .",
    "the higher order qcd errors are due not only to fixed order corrections , but also to enhancements at large and small @xmath7 because of terms of the form @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the perturbative expansion .",
    "this means that renormalization and factorization scale variation are not a reliable way of estimating higher order effects because a scale variation at one order will not give any indication of an extra @xmath81 or @xmath82 at higher orders .",
    "hence , in order to investigate the true theoretical error we must consider some way of performing correct large and small @xmath7 resummations , and/or use what we already know about going to higher orders .",
    "we are now able to look at the size of the corrections as we move from nlo to nnlo . the up quark distribution at the two orders is illustrated in fig .  [ unnlocomps ] .",
    "as one can see , the change in the central value is somewhat larger than the uncertainty due to the experimental errors .",
    "the predictions for various physical processes have been calculated .",
    "the change for quark - dominated processes , such as @xmath83 and @xmath84 production , is not very large , i.e. @xmath85 or less @xcite , but is sometimes bigger than the quoted uncertainty at each order .",
    "changes in gluon dominated quantities , such as @xmath86 , can be much larger @xcite .",
    "similarly there are implications that resummations may have significant effects on lhc predictions , particularly at high rapidity @xcite .",
    "very recently it has become clear that a less obvious source of theoretical errors can have surprisingly large effects , i.e. the precise treatment of heavy quark effects . for many years cteq",
    "have had a procedure for extrapolating from the limit where quarks are very heavy to the limit where they are effectively massless , i.e. a general - mass variable flavour number scheme ( gm - vfns ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they have chosen the scheme where the quark masses are zero as soon as the heavy quark evolution begins , i.e. zero - mass variable flavour number scheme ( zm - vfns ) , to be the default parton set . in the most recent analysis @xcite",
    "they have switched to the gm - vfns definition as default and noticed that this has a very large effect on their small-@xmath7 light quark distributions , mainly determined by fitting to hera data , where mass corrections are important , and on lhc predictions .",

    "the correction of this approximate nnlo vfns between @xcite and @xcite using the scheme in @xcite led to large corrections to the gluon distribution at small @xmath7 and by evolution , also to the light quark distributions at higher scales , as seen in fig .",
    "[ mrst06 ] .",
    "this results in the corrections to lhc cross - sections shown in table 1 , i.e. up to @xmath89 . in this case",
    "the change in procedure was less dramatic than that for the cteq6.5 result , where the original approximation was of massless quarks , and was also at one order lower .",
    "the size of the change was certainly unexpected .",
    "it is important to note that in both these cases the change is not really representative of an uncertainty , since each represents a correction of something that was known to be wrong .",
    "however , in each case the `` wrongness '' was thought to be an approximation requiring only a small correction , an expectation that was optimistic .",
    "some parton sets currently available are still extracted using similar ( or worse ) `` approximations '' , and even in the best case the limited order of the calculation means that everything is to some extent an approximation , with the size of the correction being by definition uncertain .",

    "there are various ways of looking at uncertainties due to the errors on data . for genuinely global fits ,",
    "using @xmath42 is not a sensible option due to incompatibility between data sets and possibly between data and theory .",
    "uncertainties due to parton distributions from experimental errors lead to rather small , @xmath90 uncertainties for most lhc quantities , and are fairly similar for all approaches .",
    "however , sometimes the central values using different sets differ by more than this . the uncertainties from input assumptions , e.g. cuts on data , sets used , parameterisations _ etc .",
    "_ , are comparable and sometimes larger than statistical uncertainties . in particular , the detail of uncertainties on the flavour decomposition of the quarks is still developing .",
    "uncertainties from higher orders / resummation in qcd are significant , and electroweak corrections are also potentially large at very high energies . at the lhc measurement at high rapidities , e.g. @xmath91 , would be useful in testing our understanding of qcd .",
