    "the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite has conducted numerous wide - area surveys , yielding a rich legacy of image data and point source catalogs that have become heavily used commodities . in terms of sky coverage ,",
    "the largest of these are the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire programs ( glimpse , glimpse  ii , glimpse  3d ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) covering almost 400 square degrees of the milky way plane in all four mid - infrared bands with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath1 mapping of the outer galaxy ( smog ; * ? ? ? * ) , the @xmath1 legacy survey of the cygnus - x complex @xcite , and the vela - carina large program @xcite together cover another 120 square degrees . the warm @xmath1 mission program glimpse  360 @xcite imaged @xmath2511 square degrees of the outer galactic plane in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "deep glimpse @xcite re - imaged a similar portion of the galactic plane as glimpse i / ii , but only at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m , using a longer 10.4 s integration time .",
    "other galactic programs and numerous extragalactic legacy programs provided much deeper datasets but over relatively small fields of view .",
    "our focus here is primarily the galactic science programs that have yielded large lists of point sources .",
    "table  [ surveys.tab ] summarizes the approximate coverages , exposure times , observational bandpasses , and total number of photometered point sources for these and other galactic _ spitzer _ survey .",
    "there are two types of glimpse source lists : a high reliability point source `` catalog '' and a more complete point source `` archive '' .",
    "the source lists are a result of doing photometry on each irac frame , averaging all detections made in a single band ( in - band merge ) , then merging the photometry from all wavelengths , including 2mass @xmath3 sources , at a given position on the sky ( cross - band merge ) .",
    "the glimpse source list criteria have been developed to ensure that each source is a legitimate detection and that the fluxes reported for the irac bands are of high quality . as of this writing , these @xmath1 programs have generated nearly 158 million sources in the highly reliable _ glimpse point source catalogs _",
    "( gpsc ) and 229 million in the more complete _ glimpse point source archives _ ( gpsa ) .",
    "the utility of point source catalogs resulting from the _ spitzer _ mission depends , partly , on understanding their completeness ( i.e. , the ratio of true sources detected to the number of all true sources ) . the stellar magnitude at which the gpsc or gpsa is nominally complete varies with bandpass .",
    "it also varies greatly as a function of background surface brightness and as a function of local source density where confusion with neighboring sources limits detection and photometry .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite shows how high diffuse background levels inhibit the detection of point sources in the _ spitzer _ 8.0 @xmath0 m band , which is affected by strong , diffuse emission features arising from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in and around regions of star formation . the irac 5.8 @xmath0 m band , and to a much lesser extent the 3.6 @xmath0 m band ,",
    "also encompass these features , leading to strong spatial completeness variations , especially in complex fields near the galactic plane .",
    "it is widely recognized that sensitivity to point sources is significantly reduced in high - background fields and fields having high point source densities , but there has not yet been a general quantitative analysis of this effect .    our goal in this contribution is to quantify the photometric completeness in the four _ spitzer _ irac bandpasses , considering separately the effects of 1 ) high diffuse backgrounds , and 2 ) high point source surface densities . in section 2 we describe an artificial star analysis procedure for addressing the effects of incompleteness resulting from diffuse background emission . in section 3",
    "we provide plots and tables of completeness as a function of diffuse background level and stellar magnitude . in section 4",
    "we address the effects of incompleteness resulting from source crowding ( i.e. , confusion ) , and we provide plots and tables of the magnitude at which 90% completeness is achieved as a function of point source surface density . all magnitudes referenced herein refer to the vega magnitude system used by the glimpse pipeline and data products .",
    "glimpse  i obtained two 1.2 s exposures of each object , while glimpse  ii obtained three such 1.2 s exposures .",
    "glimpse  3d utilized either two or three 1.2 s exposures at each location .",
    "glimpse  360 and deep glimpse employed the high - dynamic - range ( hdr ) mode to obtain three 0.4 and 10.4 s exposures at each position .",
    "we adopt the glimpse  i / ii/3d survey strategy and its resulting gpsc and gpsa as our baseline dataset , and we perform a similar analysis for the glimpse  360/deep  glimpse survey strategy . although it is unrealistic to perform a completeness characterization for every possible survey strategy and sightline , we intend that these two results be general enough that consumers of source lists generated as part of glimpse and similarly processed _ spitzer _ irac surveys , such as smog , cygnus - x , and vela - carina can infer completeness for those programs as well . this completeness analysis is pertinent only to point sources and is not appropriate for extended sources .",
    "we selected a @xmath21.5 square degree region of the glimpse i survey between @xmath4 , @xmath5 , exhibiting a large range in diffuse background level to use as a test region .",
    "this area contains some of the brightest mid - ir background regions in the galactic plane .",
    "figure  [ pretty ] shows a logarithmic greyscale representation of this region in the 8 @xmath0 m irac band .",
    "this region of the galactic plane spans a large dynamic range from 20 mjy / sr in the lower left to over 5000 mjy / sr .",
    "yellow crosses show detected 8.0 @xmath0 m point sources fainter than 12th magnitude as included in the glimpse point source catalog .",
    "the varying density of cataloged sources from lower left to upper right dramatically illustrates the effects of high and complex background levels on completeness .    the glimpse  i data in this region is comprised of @xmath2600 individual 1.2-second exposures in each of the four @xmath6 bandpasses .",
    "the irac pixel size is 1.2  at all four bandpasses . to each 256@xmath7256 pixel",
    "basic calibrated data ( bcd ) image we added roughly 600 artificial stars at random locations using an average psf appropriate for each band , as constructed by the glimpse data processing team from an ensemble of irac point sources .",
    "the psf was scaled to a random magnitude between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , gaussian noise ( @xmath10 ) was added to each artificial star psf on a pixel - by - pixel basis , and the artificial star was added at a ( pseudo- ) random location to the bcd image .",
    "the center locations of the artificial stars were constrained to 1 ) lie no closer than 5 pixels from the edge of the image , and 2 ) lie no closer than 3 pixels to a real star detected during previous processing by the glimpse pipeline ( dubbed the `` actual '' list of point sources ) .",
    "this avoids both edge effects and the effects of confusion from neighboring point sources in order to focus on effects solely related to diffuse background levels .",
    "we set @xmath8=8 @xmath9=15 for all bands , spanning seven magnitudes in brightness to cover nearly the entire dynamic range of the @xmath11 survey in order to sample both very complete and very incomplete flux levels .",
    "the artificial stars have the same magnitude in each band .",
    "effectively , this means that we are simulating sources having zero color , which comprise the vast majority ( @xmath294% of sources have @xmath12 ) of all gpsc sources having measurements in all four bands .",
    "however , it is not practical to conduct a general analysis for arbitrary spectral energy distributions .",
    "the glimpse pipeline was run to generate a list of point sources from the actual+artificial images in the same manner as the published _",
    "glimpse point source catalogs _ and _ glimpse point source archives_.    inclusion in the highly reliable _ glimpse point source catalog _ requires that a source be detected _ twice _",
    "( i.e. , in at least two individual irac exposures ; detection is performed on the bcd frames ) in any one irac band at s / n@xmath135 and _ at least once _ in any adjacent band at s / n@xmath135 , where the 2mass k@xmath14 band is allowed as an adjacent band for irac 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "hence , it is possible for a source to be included in the gpsc but lack photometry in as many as two ( or even three ) of the four irac bands .",
    "most commonly , non - detections occur at irac bands 5.8 and/or 8.0 @xmath0 m as a result of the reduced instrumental sensitivity and the decreasing flux on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the spectral energy distribution for the majority of astrophysical sources .",
    "objects with rising spectral energy distributions , such as protostars , evolved stars exhibiting circumstellar excesses , or heavily extincted objects , could have detections at irac 5.8 & 8.0 @xmath0 m but not at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "inclusion in the catalog also requires that 1 ) a source does not fall within the psf wings of a saturated source ( as defined in the glimpse data release documentation ) , 2 ) no hot or dead pixel lies within 3 pixels of source center , 3 ) the source is not within 3 pixels of a frame edge , and 4 ) no archive source lies within 2  of the source . furthermore , the sources used to identify and confirm a detection must be brighter than 0.6 mjy ( 14.2 mag ) , 0.4 mjy ( 14.1 ) , 2 mjy ( 11.9 ) , and 10.0 mjy ( 9.5 ) in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands , respectively .",
    "however , sources fainter than these limits at a particular band may appear in the catalogs if they are identified and confirmed using _ other _ bands .",
    "users should consult the glimpse data release documentation for a full description of source selection and rejection criteria .",
    "inclusion in the less reliable but more complete _ glimpse point source archive _ requires that a source be detected at least once in any two bands at s / n@xmath133 and that there are no neighboring sources within 0.5 .",
    "sources that lie within the psf wings of a saturated star _ are _ included in the archive .",
    "this last criterion means that the completeness we estimate for the catalog is going to be suppressed relative to the archive at all magnitudes and at all background levels because of the presence of saturated stars .",
    "the saturation limit for the short 1.2 s glimpse  i / ii/3d frame times is approximately 7 , 6.5 , 4 , and 4 magnitudes ( 439 , 450 , 2930 , and 1590 mjy ) for irac bands 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the saturated source areal density is a strong function of galactic position but is on the order of @xmath240 per square degree at @xmath15 , as estimated from 2mass k - band source counts .",
    "band is used as a proxy for the irac 3.6 @xmath0 m band because the glimpse pipeline does not detect or extract saturated sources . ] therefore , the effect of saturated stars on completeness in the glimpse  i / ii/3d catalogs and similar shallow survey catalogs is minimal , given that the psf wings ( @xmath1624 pixels , but an irregular region given by the shape of diffraction spikes ) comprise @xmath171% of the survey area .    to characterize the completeness at each band the list of detected point sources from the `` actual+artificial '' images",
    "was compared to the input list of artificial sources ( i.e. , the artificial list ) .",
    "any detected source within 1.2 pixels of a source in the `` artificial '' list was considered to be a successfully recovered source .",
    "we find that the magnitudes of recovered stars always match the magnitudes of inserted stars within the expected uncertainties , typically 0.05 mag at the bright end and @xmath20.5 mag at the faint end .",
    "therefore , the matching process does not include a magnitude criterion .",
    "we found it necessary to develop two definitions of completeness . in the first definition , dubbed completeness1 ,",
    "we define completeness as the number of artificial sources present in the resulting gpsc divided by the number of input artificial sources .",
    "this inclusive definition allows for the possibility that a given star may be included in the gpsc _ even though it may lack a detection _ at any given band , n. in the second definition , completeness2 , we require that a given source actually be detected in band n specifically , rather than being included in the catalog only by virtue of its detection at other bands .",
    "the more restrictive completeness2 values are always lower than completeness1 , especially at 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m where the deleterious effects of high and structured backgrounds on source identification are most severe .",
    "figure  [ comp1a ] ( upper panel ) plots completeness1 versus background sky brightness in mjy sr@xmath18 for the irac 3.6 @xmath0 m artificial star simulations .",
    "the ordinate is partitioned into logarithmically spaced sky brightness bins to increase the reliability of high - surface - brightness bins which comprise only a small fraction of the test area .",
    "linestyles indicate stellar magnitude bins from 8th to 15th magnitude , as shown by the legend .",
    "the heavy solid curve shows the cumulative distribution of the background sky brightness .",
    "for example , the solid curve shows that approximately 35% of the background regions in our test area are brighter than 5 mjy sr@xmath18 at 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "the rapid decline in completeness at background levels greater than about 10 mjy  sr@xmath18 is clear in all but the brightest magnitude ranges . furthermore , the faintest magnitude bin , 14th ",
    "15th magnitude , is never more than 25% complete even in the regions of lowest sky brightness .",
    "we attempted to fit simple analytical formulae to these data to provide an easily integrable functional form for completeness as a function of magnitude and background level , but no simple form ( gaussian , exponential , trigonometric , polynomial ) yielded good fits across the range of magnitudes and background levels pictured in figure  [ comp1a ] .",
    "we therefore elected to simply tabulate the results and allow end users to perform their own interpolation or fitting .",
    "table  [ comp1cat.tab ] lists numerical values for completeness1 as a function of magnitude and background level for the 3.6 @xmath0 m bandpass as shown graphically in figure  [ comp1a ] .",
    "note that the uncertainties on the tabulated completeness are at the level of 1015% for the bin at the highest background levels as a result of statistical limitations , but in the other bins uncertainties are typically @xmath192% .",
    "statistics in the lowest surface brightness bin are also uncertain at the level of a few percent as a result of the paucity of extremely dark regions in the galactic plane .",
    "figure  [ comp1a ] ( lower panel ) plots completeness2 versus background sky brightness for the irac 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "table  [ comp2cat.tab ] lists these results in the same manner as for completeness1 in table  [ comp1cat.tab ] .",
    "the results are nearly identical to the completeness1 case because pah emission from diffuse background sources is relatively minor at 3.6 @xmath0 m and the flux from stellar photospheres is a maximum , thereby aiding source identification and extraction .",
    "sources in the gpsc are most commonly included by virtue of having a detection at irac 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "figure  [ comp2a ] plots completeness1 and completeness2 versus background sky brightness for the irac 4.5 @xmath0 m artificial star simulations .",
    "the overall trends are similar to 3.6 @xmath0 m where both completeness1 and completeness2 decline markedly in backgrounds above about 10 mjy sr@xmath18 . only the brightest stars , @xmath2011th magnitude , are readily detected and show a slower drop in completeness .",
    "the numerical results for completeness2 are nearly identical to completeness1 .",
    "this results from the fact that background levels are low in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band ( no pah features ) and that sources in the gpsc are almost always included by virtue of having a detection at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "tables  [ comp1cat.tab ] and [ comp2cat.tab ] record these numerical completeness data for the 4.5 @xmath0 m analysis .    figure  [ comp3a ] plots completeness1 and completeness2 versus background sky brightness for the irac 5.8 @xmath0 m simulations .",
    "these histograms show dramatically decreased completeness levels for all but the brightest stars as the background levels exceed @xmath250 mjy sr@xmath18 .",
    "the irac 5.8 @xmath0 m band contains strong pah features , and regions with specific intensities exceeding 200 mjy sr@xmath18 are not uncommon in this and other major star - forming complexes .",
    "a comparison of figure  [ comp3a ] shows that completeness2 is significantly lower than completeness1 for stars fainter than about 11th magnitude for all background levels greater than @xmath2100 mjy sr@xmath18 .",
    "this results from sources being included in the catalog ( completeness1 ) but not having a detection at 5.8 @xmath0 m ( completeness2 ) .",
    "tables  [ comp1cat.tab ] and [ comp2cat.tab ] record these numerical completeness data for the 5.8 @xmath0 m analysis .    figure  [ comp4a ] plots completeness1 and completeness2 versus background sky brightness for the 8.0 @xmath0 m simulations .",
    "while the behavior of the calculated completeness is similar to the plots for 5.8 @xmath0 m above , the difference between completeness1 and completeness2 is even more dramatic .",
    "completeness2 shows a much more rapid decline than completeness1 , to the point where sources fainter than 12th magnitude are rarely detected in any but the darkest background regions .",
    "the difference between the upper and lower panels of figure  [ comp4a ] illustrates why the number of 8.0 @xmath0 m detections in glimpse averages @xmath2030% the number of 3.6 @xmath0 m detections for a typical low - latitude sightline . in regions with background levels",
    "greater than 100 mjy sr@xmath18 , the lower panel shows that only 11th magnitude and brighter sources are likely to be represented in the catalog and have a measurement at 8.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , on a more positive note , the upper panel shows that faint 8.0 @xmath0 m sources _ are _ likely to be represented in the catalogs by virtue of having measurements at other bands , principally at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m .    in summary , figures  [ comp1a ] through [ comp4a ] ,",
    "in conjunction with tables  [ comp1cat.tab ] and [ comp2cat.tab ] provide a means of estimating the likelihood of detecting sources in a particular band and being included in the glimpse point source catalogs .",
    "these figures and tables should also be applicable to other _ spitzer _",
    "irac observations using similar short exposure times , low point source densities , and a small number of observations of each target , such as the vela - carina project which was processed by the glimpse pipeline .",
    "we performed the same analysis for the gpsa as for the gpsc .",
    "figures  [ comp1aa ] through [ comp4aa ] plot completeness1 and completeness2 as a function of background brightness for the archive .",
    "tables  [ comp1arc.tab ] and [ comp2arc.tab ] summarize these results numerically .",
    "a comparison of figures  [ comp1aa ] through [ comp4aa ] with the corresponding sequence in figures  [ comp1a ] through [ comp4a ] reveals that more stars are recovered in the archives versus the catalogs at all bands .",
    "the typical difference is a few percent to as much as a few tens of percent , with the most dramatic improvement being at low background levels for the faintest stars .",
    "glimpse 360 and deep glimpse employed the irac high - dynamic - range mode using 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands during the _ spitzer _ warm mission to obtain three 0.4 and three 10.4-second exposures at each location along a large portion of the galactic plane following the warp of the disk in the outer milky way .",
    "we employed the same artificial star methodology described above in order to generate completeness data for the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m photometry obtained in the course of these large programs .",
    "the selected test region covers a wide range of background levels in the region @xmath21 and @xmath22 obtained during the glimpse 360 observing program . the glimpse  360 completeness analysis adds and recovers artificial stars only on the 10.4 s exposures , since we are interested primarily in completeness for the faint end of the observed magnitude range .",
    "the glimpse 360 and deep glimpse observing strategy is sufficiently different from the preceding glimpse programs that slightly different criteria are applied to determine inclusion in the catalogs and archives . given three hdr sequences ( an hdr sequence means one 0.4 s exposure plus one 10.4 s exposure ) , there are six possible frames at each location in each of two bands where a source might be detected . in general , m is the number of detections for a given source out of a possible n detections .",
    "inclusion in the glimpse  360/deep glimpse catalog requires m / n@xmath130.6 in one band ( the selection band ) and m / n@xmath23 in an adjacent band ( the confirmation band ) , with s / n@xmath135 for both bands .",
    "detection in the 2mass k@xmath24 band counts as a confirmation , but in practice , only a few percent of all glimpse  360 sources are included in the catalog by virtue of having a k - band detection in addition to a 3.6 @xmath0 m detection .",
    "additionally , inclusion in the catalog requires that 1 ) the source be fainter than the non - linear regime for the irac array ( 10.25 and 9.6 mag at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m , respectively , for the irac 10.4 s exposure times ; the hdr 0.4 s data has brighter limits but is not considered here in our simulations ) , 2 ) that the source not lie within 2  of an archive source , 3 ) that the source not lie within the diffraction spikes of a saturated source , and 4 ) that no hot or dead pixels lie within 3 pixels of the source center .",
    "inclusion in the archive requires the same m / n limits but sources within 0.5  of another source are allowed , as are sources within the psf wings of a saturated source .",
    "end users should consult the glimpse  360 data delivery document for a full understanding of source flags and subtle criteria that define the catalog and the archive sources .",
    "figure  [ comp5a ] shows the completeness1 and completeness2 results for the glimpse 360/deep glimpse catalog for the 3.6 @xmath0 m band .",
    "figure  [ comp6a ] shows the completeness1 and completeness2 catalog results for 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "the histogram linestyles indicate magnitude ranges from 11  18 .",
    "tables  [ g360c1.tab ] and [ g360c2.tab ] report numerical data for the glimpse  360/deep glimpse catalog simulations for the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "these figures show that a similar trend to the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m results from the glimpse i / ii/3d simulations reported above .",
    "completeness varies as a function of both magnitude and background level . given the deeper exposures for glimpse 360/deep glimpse compared to glimpse i / ii/3d , the completeness is generally greater at",
    "any given magnitude at any given background level .",
    "one noteworthy feature of these histograms is the drop in completeness at all magnitudes , even at relatively faint sky background levels .",
    "this means that the gpsc for glimpse 360/deep glimpse is almost never 100% complete , even at the brightest magnitudes and darkest sky backgrounds .",
    "the reason for this is described subsequently .",
    "figure  [ comp7a ] shows the completeness1 and completeness2 results for the glimpse 360/deep glimpse archive for the 3.6 @xmath0 m band .",
    "figure  [ comp8a ] shows the completeness1 and completeness2 results at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "tables  [ g360a1.tab ] and [ g360a2.tab ] report numerical data for the glimpse  360/deep glimpse archive simulations for the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands . these figures and tables show that the archive completeness1 is very similar to completeness2 .",
    "this is expected , given that the lack of irac 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m data in glimpse  360 and similar surveys essentially means that all of the sources must be detected both at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m in order to appear in the catalog or the archive .    notably , glimpse  360 archive completeness in figures  [ comp7a ] through [ comp8a ] is higher than catalog completeness in figures  [ comp5a ] through [ comp6a ] , _ even at bright magnitudes and low background levels_. this results from the inclusion of sources in the archive that lie within the psf wings of saturated stars .",
    "such sources are rejected from the catalog in order to ensure high reliability .",
    "saturated stars are a much greater problem in the longer exposures used for glimpse  360/deep glimpse compared to glimpse i / ii/3d .",
    "this means the photometry for a significant fraction of the areal coverage in glimpse 360/deep glimpse catalogs is nullified because it lies under the psf wings of saturated stars . the glimpse  360/deep glimpse archives , by contrast , are significantly more complete because they include sources that lie in the psf wings of saturated stars .",
    "the magnitude of this effect in the glimpse  360/deep glimpse catalogs varies dramatically with galactic positions , being on the order of a few percent in the outer galaxy but rises to many tens of percent in crowded regions of the inner galaxy .",
    "figure  [ saturate180 ] and figure  [ saturate030 ] show greyscale representations of the glimpse  360/deep glimpse irac 3.6 @xmath0 m mosaic near @xmath25  and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "red circles in the left panel of each figure mark sources included in the gpsc , while green circles in the right panels mark sources included in the gpsa .",
    "the effect of `` dead zones '' around bright stars is dramatic in the left panel of figure  [ saturate030 ] where high stellar densities cause the removal of photometric results from the gpsc for a significant fraction of the survey area .",
    "by contrast , the effects of saturated sources in the gpsc in figure  [ saturate180 ] for the @xmath25  field are rather subtle . here and in other such fields having low stellar densities",
    ", the completeness of the catalog and archive will be more similar than for high - density fields , as only a few percent of the survey area falls under the wings of saturated stars . in summary ,",
    "catalog incompleteness in glimpse  360/deep glimpse varies greatly with location , and users are encouraged to consider the merits of the gpsa where high levels of completeness are desired .",
    "having empirically assessed the completeness simply as a function of one parameter , i.e. , background level , we now consider the role that the structure of the diffuse background emission plays in limiting point source source detection .",
    "figure  [ pretty ] shows that not only is the galactic plane filled with regions of high surface brightness ( i.e. , regions where poisson noise from background photons is elevated ) , but the emission is also highly structured , having a variety of filamentary morphologies on scales all the way down to the irac psf ( and probably on smaller scales that would be significant in data having higher angular resolution ) .",
    "this structure further complicates source identification and extraction .    as a test of",
    "whether _ photon noise _ or _ structure _ from diffuse backgrounds is the more significant cause of incompleteness , we conducted the same artificial star test described in section 2.1 using the `` residual '' images generated by the glimpse pipeline after point sources have been removed .",
    "we smoothed these residual images in the @xmath27333  test region , first with a 101-pixel box and then a 27-pixel box to eliminate `` structure '' on scales smaller than about 25 times the point spread function and 7 times the psf , respectively .",
    "these smoothing scales represent large and moderate smoothing , respectively . to avoid edge - of - frame effects",
    ", we smoothed a mosaic image of the residuals and then reconstructed the original bcd images . to the smoothed residual bcd images we added poisson noise , at a level appropriate for each pixel , and readnoise , according to the irac documentation : 11.8 , 12.1 , 9.1 , and 7.1 electrons per pixel for the irac",
    "bandpasses 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "artificial stars were added at exactly the same positions and magnitudes as in section 2.1 before running the glimpse pipeline to extract sources and construct a catalog and archive .",
    "the input list of artificial stars was compared to the recovered list of stars to assess the completeness .",
    "figure  [ sm27 - 1 ] shows the resulting gpsc completeness2 versus background level for 8.0 @xmath0 m , in a way exactly analogous to figure  [ comp4a ] , except that now the effect of structure has been eliminated using a 27-pixel smoothing box .",
    "a comparison of figure  [ sm27 - 1 ] with figure  [ comp4a ] shows that the completeness is much greater for any given magnitude or sky brightness level once the diffuse background has been smoothed .",
    "results for other bands are similar .",
    "figure  [ sm101 - 1 ] shows gpsc completeness2 versus background level for the 8.0 @xmath0 m band , in a way exactly analogous to figure  [ comp4a ] , except that now the effect of structure have been eliminated using a 101-pixel smoothing box .",
    "comparison with figures  [ comp4a ] and [ sm27 - 1 ] reveals that a much greater fraction of sources at all magnitudes and background levels are recovered and recorded in the catalog when the diffuse background structure is reduced even further .",
    "we conclude that , at the magnitude ranges of interest to users of glimpse and similar @xmath1 irac surveys , incompleteness resulting from diffuse backgrounds is dominated by the effects of `` structure '' in the background rather than purely by photon noise .",
    "the artificial star analysis performed in section 2.1 implicitly includes both effects . in the absence of a simple , single parameter suitable for describing the complexity of structured background emission in the galactic plane",
    ", we retain the tables and figures , as previously presented , as a way to assess incompleteness as a function of mean background level .",
