    "in the dynamical study of iterated surface homeomorphisms , it is common to seek to compute the topological entropy of each member of an infinite family of isotopy classes , perhaps on varying surfaces  the topological entropy of an isotopy class being the minimum topological entropy of a homeomorphism in the class , which is realised by a nielsen - thurston canonical representative  @xcite .",
    "the normal approach to such a problem is to use train - track methods  @xcite , which not only make it possible to compute topological entropy , but also , in the pseudo - anosov case , provide a markov partition for the pseudo - anosov homeomorphism in the isotopy class , and hence information about the structure of its invariant singular measured foliations .",
    "one drawback of this approach is that even single train tracks are fairly unwieldy objects .",
    "it is usually far from straightforward to describe an infinite family of train tracks , to verify that they are indeed invariant under the relevant isotopy classes , and to compute the transition matrices and hence the topological entropy of the induced train track maps : very often , the best that one can reasonably do is to draw pictures of typical train tracks in the family and rely on the reader s ability to observe that they are invariant .    in this paper",
    "an alternative approach to the problem is described in the case of families of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of punctured disks  such isotopy classes can be described by elements of artin s braid groups .",
    "the method is illustrated by applying it to two families of braids considered by and kin  @xcite , which are of interest in the study of braids with low topological entropy .",
    "the results presented here about these families are not new , therefore : the emphasis is on the method used to obtain them , which can be contrasted with the train track methods of hironaka and kin .",
    "the methods developed are a relatively straightforward application of dynnikov s coordinate system  @xcite on the boundary of the teichmller space of the punctured disk , together with the _ update rules _ which describe the action of the artin braid generators on the boundary of teichmller space in terms of dynnikov coordinates .",
    "this background material is described in section  [ sec : dynnikov ] .",
    "the practical application of this theory is very much eased by the results presented in section  [ sec : updatecontig ] , which give update rules for braids which can be written as ascending or descending sequences of contiguous artin generators ( or their inverses ) , such as @xmath0 .",
    "examples of the application of the method to two two - parameter families of braids are given in section  [ sec : main ] : the examples include showing that an infinite family of braids is of reducible type , as well as computing topological entropies in the pseudo - anosov case .",
    "this section is essentially an expansion of parts of dynnikov s very terse paper  @xcite : see also  @xcite , and  @xcite for dynamical applications .",
    "one difference is that in the papers cited above the action of the @xmath1-braid group @xmath2 on an @xmath3-punctured disk is considered , whereas here , as is more appropriate in a dynamical setting , @xmath2 acts on an @xmath1-punctured disk .",

    "this provides a method of computing the topological entropy of braids in such families which is more direct and tractable than the train track approach . in this section , this method is illustrated with two families of braids considered in  @xcite , which are of interest in the study of braids of low topological entropy .",
    "these families are @xmath195 , and @xmath196 , where @xmath197 the approach taken here can be contrasted with the method of proof of the same results in  @xcite .",
