    "a diffusive electron - electron interaction correction ( eec ) to the conductivity was predicted theoretically  @xcite about 30 years ago . in 2d system",
    "it is proportional to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the momentum relaxation time ) and grows in amplitude as temperature decreases . a way to experimentally single - out eec among other numerous effects",
    "is based on its property not to affect hall component of magnetoconductivity tensor @xmath7 in perpendicular magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "eec therefore gives birth to temperature - dependent and parabolic with field contribution to the diagonal magnetoresistance @xmath8 and correction to the hall coefficient @xmath9 , both being proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "the predicted features were observed in numerous experiments , mainly with n - type gaas - based 2d systems  @xcite .",
    "however , the quantitative level of agreement between theory and experiment was achived only in the 2000s by minkov group  @xcite from simultaneous analysis of both hall and diagonal components of resistivity tensor .",
    "the suggested method was later approbated by others  @xcite .",
    "we note , that zeeman splitting effects were negligible in most of the studied systems .",
    "zeeman splitting was predicted to decrease the eec value  @xcite , the physical interpretation of this effect introduced later in ref .",
    "@xcite consists in decreasing the effective number of triplet channels with field . for the diffusive regime @xmath10 ,",
    "the eec is predicted to be quadratic - in - field in the low field limit , and proportional to logarithm of field in the high field limit .",
    "experimentally , however , the effect of zeeman splitting on eec in the diffusive regime was only briefly considered in refs .  @xcite . for the most ubiquitous 2d system",
    "known , 2deg in si - mosfet , which fits well all theory requirements , no convincing measurements of the eec have been done so far . at the same time",
    "this system demonstrates positive magnetoresistance in parallel field , the behavior expected for eec . in the 1980-s",
    "there were attempts to reveal eec in si from temperature and magnetic field dependences  @xcite of resistivity ; these attempts were based on not yet developed theoretical concepts and did not lead to a self - consistent picture of magnetotransport .",
    "interest to zeeman splitting effects was resumed in 1997 with observation of a huge rise in resistivity of 2deg in clean si - mosfets in parallel magnetic field  @xcite , close to metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "the interest further increased with interpretation of this magnetoresistance as a signature of magnetic quantum phase transition @xcite . in the 2000s several attempts to treat the parallel field magnetoresistance ( mr ) in terms of renormalization - group approach",
    "were taken both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "this approach is in fact self - consistent generalization of the eec for arbitrary interaction strength and conduction .",
    "independently , another theoretical approach was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and successfully applied  @xcite , which accounts for resistivity increase with field simply by renormalization of the density of states and single impurity scattering time .",
    "the latter effect is essentially different from logarithmic eec which emerges from multiple electron - impurity scattering .",
    "the experimental situation , however , is more complicated : studies  @xcite showed a strong effect of disorder on the parallel field magnetoresistance , that was discussed in terms of the band tail effects in refs .",
    "moreover , detailed studies of the mr on different material systems  @xcite did demonstrate quantitative disagreement between the fitted - to - eec theory temperature- and magnetic field dependences of the conductivity .    to summarize the present state of the field",
    ", there seems to be a common agreement on the zeeman nature of parallel field mr in 2d carrier systems .",
    "however , two conceptually different underlining mechanisms of mr were put forward : ( i ) eec ( multiple - scattering effect ) and ( ii ) screening change in magnetic field ( single - scattering effect ) . which of them is responsible for the experimentally observed strong mr in parallel field ?",
    "the answer is especially crucial in the vicinity of the metal - to - insulator transition , where the mr is dramatically strong .",
    "unfortunately , both theories become inapplicable in this regime of small conductances @xmath11 . to address this issue ,",
    "we have chosen to approach the problem from the large conductance regime , where both theories have solid ground , though the mr is low .",
    "in our paper we contest possible origin of the parallel field magnetoresistance of weakly interacting 2d electron gas . in order to study eec ,",
    "we take detailed measurements of the magnetoresistance tensor in tilted field , and analyze the data using the procedure developed in refs .",
    "we stress that our approach does not rely on any particular microscopic theory , rather , it is _ ab - initio _ phenomenological and uses only general property of the eec in the diffusive regime to affect @xmath12 solely .    for the experiments we have chosen the simplest model system , the 2d electron gas in si in diffusive regime @xmath13 , @xmath14 . to vary the strength of the zeeman splitting , and thus , the eec magnitude , we tilted magnetic field with respect to the 2d plane .",
    "this procedure allowed us to extract eec on top of other magnetoresistivity effects and to establish two principally different regions : ( i ) high - field region , where eec depends on total field and quantitatively agrees with the theoretically predicted @xmath15 asymptotics , and ( ii ) low - field region , where eec unexpectedly depends on perpendicular field component , grows with field and does not match existing theories .",
    "our observations suggest a new insight on the origin of the parallel field mr : ( i ) the high - field small and @xmath16independent eec @xmath17 , revealed in the current study , can not be responsible for large and @xmath18-dependent parallel field mr , and ( ii ) application of even low @xmath19 perpendicular field component strongly suppresses mr .",
    "the latter fact proves not purely spin nature of the parallel field mr and points at the incompleteness of the existing theory of mr .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a brief description of experimental details in section ii , we give theoretical background in section iii , and describe the results in section iv , first on the eec , then on the experimental proof of the zeeman origin of the magnetic field effect on eec , and further we compare the known eec with the parallel field magnetoresistance to show that the eec is not the main origin of the parallel field magnetoresistance . in section v we discuss the obtained result and suggest possible directions of further development .",
    "the ac - measurements ( 13 to 73hz ) of the resistivity were performed at temperatures 0.3 - 25k in magnetic fields up",
    "to 15 t with two ( 100 ) si - mos samples with 200 nm oxide thickness : si-40 , ( peak mobility @xmath20m@xmath21/vs at @xmath22  k ) , si-24 ( 0.22m@xmath23/vs ) . the samples were lithographically defined as rectangular hall bars of the size 0.8@xmath245  mm@xmath21 . to obtain the data for different orientations of magnetic field relative to the 2d plane ,",
    "the sample platform was rotated _ in situ _ at low temperature using a step motor .",
    "because of the smallness of the studied effects and unavoidable misalignment of potential contacts there always was some asymmetry ( within less than a few percents ) of both @xmath25 and @xmath26 with respect to field reversal at a constant @xmath27 ( @xmath28 na ) current direction . to compensate this asymmetry the field",
    "was swept from positive to negative values and the data were symmetrized .",
    "the alignment of the sample parallel to magnetic field was done using the resistivity peak due to weak localization .",
    "the carrier density @xmath29 was varied by the gate voltage in the range @xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "the field was tilted in the @xmath32-plane , always perpendicular to the current direction , which is however not crucial for si because of weak spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "we have selected samples with moderate carrier mobility in order to ensure studies deep in the diffusive regime @xmath33 , where eec theory should be applicable , and at the same time to achieve @xmath34 in available magnetic field . other features which make si - mos system preferable for this study are ( i ) short - range and uncorrelated scatterers which make motion diffusive , ( ii ) large conductance @xmath35 , which ensure quantum correction theory applicable , ( iii ) very thin potential well @xmath36 nm which excludes orbital effects in parallel magnetic fields up to 20 t , and ( iv ) filling of the lowest size quantization subband solely for @xmath37@xmath31 with effective mass @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the idea of the present study is based on a property of the e - e correction to affect only diagonal component of the conductivity tensor @xcite : @xmath39    correspondingly , the procedure of the eec extraction  @xcite for arbitrary ( @xmath40 ) value includes the following steps : ( i ) reversing the measured resistivity tensor one calculates the conductivity tensor .",
    "( ii ) from @xmath7 one finds the mobility @xmath41 value , using experimentally determined density @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "( iii ) subtracting @xmath42 from @xmath12 one finds the correction @xmath43 .",
    "the mobility @xmath44 value is a by - product of this algorithm .",
    "if the conductivity is large , @xmath45 , the above algorithm leads to the following expressions for the resistivity components : @xmath46 \\label{aamrtensor}\\ ] ] @xmath47 as we checked , these formulae are valid for all our data with @xmath48 kohm .    in practice , both @xmath49 and mobility @xmath41 in eqs .",
    "( [ aamctensor],[aamrtensor],[simpleds ] ) might depend on @xmath50 and @xmath18 thus incorporating other possible magnetoresistance effects .",
    "nevertheless , as follows from eq.([simpleds ] ) , no matter how the mobility depends on field , the correction to the hall coefficient arises from eec solely .",
    "depending on the geometry of experiment the following cases are possible : ( i ) the field is directed normally to the sample plane , @xmath51 , during the sweep ( this case refers to most of the previous studies ) .",
    "( ii ) the field is inclined by angle @xmath52 relative to the 2d plane , in order to enhance zeeman effects which depend on @xmath53 .",
    "( iii ) the field magnitude @xmath54 remains constant while sample is rotated relative to the field direction ; in the latter case one expects the zeeman effects to remain unchanged , thus leading to the angle - independent @xmath49 .",
    "we note here that in the case of geometry ( ii ) data processing requires knowledge of the ratio @xmath55 solely , rather than the tilt angle .",
    "according to our definition of density  @xcite , the @xmath55 ratio is obtained from the measured linear - in - total - field high temperature limit of the hall resistance @xmath56 .",
    "we find this limit by linear extrapolation of @xmath57 to the highest temperatures ( typically 15k ) , and by ignoring low - field effects ( see below ) .",
    "making use of geometries ( ii ) and ( iii ) is the key feature of the present study .",
    "we note here that the @xmath3-factor in si is large ( @xmath58 ) and isotropic , which insures the zeeman effects to be tilt independent . in systems with anisotropic @xmath3-factor ,",
    "like holes in gaas  @xcite one should take into account different components of the @xmath3-factor tensor , which complicates the problem .    according to the theory of interaction corrections  @xcite in its modern form @xcite",

    "the problem with mosfets is that @xmath65 ( which is typically less than @xmath68 ) can hardly be measured directly in zero and low magnetic fields , because valley splitting of shubnikov - de haas oscillations does not exceed level broadening and hence can not be resolved @xcite .",

    "we therefore can use @xmath62 as adjustable parameter , which quantifies effective degree of valley multiplicity .    in 2001 ,",
    "the eec was recalculated by zala et al @xcite and a new `` ballistic '' contribution was introduced , that gave explanation to @xmath71 dependence observed in different 2d systems in the regime @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "it was shown experimentally @xcite that the ballistic and diffusive corrections differ fundamentally : diffusive eec does not affect hall component of conductivity tensor ( see eq .",
    "[ aamctensor ] ) , whereas ballistic contribution is basically renormalization of the single impurity scattering time or mobility . in the present study",
    "we do not consider ballistic contribution , rather , we extract from the experimental data and analyse the diffusive part of the eec solely .",
    "theoretical prediction for the zeeman splitting dependence of the eec was first given in @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and the two asymptotics for @xmath75 function are : @xmath76 @xmath77    within the same theoretical formalism , the zeeman splitting effect on ballistic and diffusive corrections to magnetoresistance in parallel field was recalculated in ref .  @xcite . although the theory was successfully used to fit some data on parallel field magnetoresistance  @xcite , the procedure of the comparison with theory is ill - defined and requires careful separation of the diffusive and ballistic eec contributions in the crossover regime .",

    "a we show that from the practical point of view this limit is achieved already for @xmath92 .    to conclude this section , studying magnetoresistance in purely parallel field is insufficient to disentangle the ballistic and eec contributions .",
    "tilting the field enables one to overcome this drawback . as shown in the next section , application of high tilted fields allows us to achieve in experiment the asymptotical @xmath93 behavior , for which there is a firm theory prediction .",
    "this section is organized as follows : in the first subsection we discuss phenomenology , low - field regime and experimental proof of the eec dependence on modulus of magnetic field rather than on its direction . in the second subsection",

    "[ perpfield]g ) @xmath49 grows as @xmath50 increases , then reaches a maximum and decreases in the high field region b. in the low field region a , the feature in @xmath49 originates from non - linearity of the hall resistance with field ( as seen from fig .",

    "if we adopt the effective valley multiplicity @xmath62 to be somewhat smaller than 2 , the agreement will become even better . when making such comparison with earlier data one should keep in mind that previous results were obtained in high - temperature ballistic regime , where both valleys contribute equally and @xmath69 exactly .",
    "one should also take into account that the @xmath147 values for the diffusive ( this work ) and ballistic ( previous data @xcite ) regimes should not coincide , for the reasons discussed in ref .",
    "we therefore conclude the temperature dependence of the diffusive eec ( i.e. , @xmath131-values ) to agree quantitatively with earlier data and to agree qualitatively with theory .",
    "possible reasons for large uncertainty in @xmath132-values and their poor consistency with @xmath131-values may be ( i ) too narrow range of fields accessible for identifying @xmath4 dependence ( see above ) , ( ii ) the effective number of valleys ( @xmath148 ) may be different in the field and temperature dependences .",

    "having developed a technique to measure zeeman field dependence of the eec directly , with no adjustable parameters , we can compare now eec with magnetoresistance .",
    "figure [ parallel]a shows a set of magnetoresistance curves collected at different temperatures for @xmath99  @xmath31 in the parallel field orientation .",
    "high field asymptotics of eec for the same sample and same density @xmath151 is also shown in fig.[parallel]a by dashed line ( the prefactor 0.15 for this particular density is found in the previous section ) .",
    "the observed magnetoresistance appears to be ( i ) an order of magnitude larger than eec , and ( ii ) has much stronger temperature dependence ; therefore , it is mainly of a different origin .",
    "this is one of the key results of the present study , it brings into a question the validity of usage parallel field magnetoresistance for finding the interaction constant .",
    "we have shown above that the multiple scattering ( eec ) approach leads to much smaller magnetoresistance than that observed ; we test below whether or not single impurity scattering processes play dominant role in magnetoresistance .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ parallel]a ( dotted lines ) the magnetocondutivity calculated according to eq . ( 4 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite ( two - valley version of theory @xcite ) for a system with @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 .",
    "the calculated theory curve seems to demonstrate a reasonable agreement with the same experimental data .",
    "this agreement ( in contrast to above sharp disagreement - see the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ parallel]a ) has a simple physical explanation : the calculated curve comprises mainly ( more than 65 % ) single impurity scattering renormalization , and only 35% of the diffusive eec .",
    "we believe that by using two different @xmath60 values for ballistic and diffusive contributions @xcite and by introducing finite valley splitting and intervalley scattering rate @xcite ( i.e. about 4 adjustable parameters ) one can achieve a perfect agreement with experiment .",
    "this exercise reproduces an apparent successful comparison of the parallel field magnetoresistance data in si - mosfets@xcite with theory@xcite .",
    "is this the end of the story and complete understanding of the magnetoresistance in the 2d system ?",
    "our answer is no ; in order to argue this point we apply perpendicular field .",
    "theoretically @xcite the zeeman field - induced magnetoresistance should remain the same in tilted field .",
    "figure  [ parallel]b shows magnetoresistance at fixed @xmath155  k and @xmath99  @xmath31 for various tilt angles . in perpendicular field ( 0@xmath110 curve ) , as field increases from zero , weak localization becomes suppressed , leading to the negative magnetoresistance ; further we observe almost flat magnetoresistance until the onset of shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
    "such classically flat magnetoresistance is a signature of a field - independent mobility . in the opposite limit of parallel field ( 90@xmath110 curve )",
    "we observe a huge , 25% magnetoresistance in field of 6 t .",
    "this fact itself is remarkable because we did not expect much difference between the parallel and perpendicular configurations in fields @xmath156 within the above simple considerations .",
    "although we do not believe in orbital origin of the parallel field magnetoresistance , let us assume for a moment that only parallel component of the field affects mobility .",
    "if this is so , then by tilting the field from purely in - plane direction ( @xmath157 ) to slightly out of plane ( 75@xmath110 ) , when parallel component of the field decreases only by 4% , we would expect roughly the same positive magnetoresistance as that in the purely parallel field .",
    "surprisingly , after suppression of weak localization , the observed positive upturn in magnetoresistance is quite shallow and is no more than @xmath1586% ! for intermediate tilt angle ( 45@xmath110 ) , the magnetoresistance ( fig .",
    "5b ) only slightly deviates from the perpendicular field data , which further confirms suppression of the parallel field mr by perpendicular component .    to summarize our observations ,",
    "the positive magnetoresistance that is weak in perpendicular and tilted fields increases dramatically when the field turns parallel to the 2d plane .",
    "such behavior is counterintuitive and qualitatively different from that in gaas - based structures .",
    "in the present study , by using magnetoresitance tensor measurements technique in tilted magnetic field , we extracted eec and explored zeeman effects in conductivity .",
    "we demonstrated fruitfulness of this approach and revealed the anticipated @xcite high - field logarithmic asymptotics of the eec .",
    "our measurements also reveal several puzzling features of the magnetotransport in si - mosfets .",
    "firstly , the low - field drop of the eec ( i.e. , the increase in hall resistance ) , detected in our experiments , lacks an explanation . in order to clarify this issue",
    "one requires more precise very - low - field hall measurements with variety of samples ranging in mobility and conductance values , as well as theoretical framework to treat the problem .",
    "another important observation is that the parallel field magnetoresistance is not produced by eec solely .",
    "this observation poses a question of the applicability of the eec theory to determination of the interaction constant from the parallel field magnetoresistance @xcite . indeed",
    ", our data prove that there is another unexplored mechanismthat also contributes to parallel field magnetoresistance ; it s necessary to disentangle different mr mechanisms , before extracting the fermi - liquid constant .",
    "finally , our key result is that the parallel field magnetoresistance is suppressed by rather insignificant nonquantizing perpendicular field component .",
    "this result directly contradicts to the predictions of the electron - electron interaction theory @xcite . were the parallel field magnetoresistance caused by eec , such behavior",
    "could be straightforvardly explained by complete suppression of magnetoresistance already at @xmath159 , according to eq .",
    "( [ aamrtensor ] ) .",
    "however , we have shown above , that eec is too small and alone can not be a reason for the parallel field magnetoresistance . according to eq .",
    "( [ aamrtensor ] ) it means that the parallel field mr comes from mobility renormalization .",
    "there are several potential mechanisms of such renormalization : ( i ) mobility may drop with parallel field due to finite width effects @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , however , is not supported by our data ( compare the 90@xmath110- and 75@xmath110-curves in fig .  [ parallel ] that show a factor of 3 diminished magnetoresistance in almost the same parallel field ) , and is not very probable because of thin potential well in si - mosfets ( @xmath160 nm ) compared to magnetic length @xmath161[nm]@xmath162[t])@xmath163 ; ( ii ) mobility may depend on zeeman splitting in agreement with the predictions of the screening theory @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism should produce direction - independent positive magnetoresistance , exactly the behavior observed in heavily - doped multisubband thin si quantum wells@xcite .",
    "this however does not reconcile with our data .",
    "( iii ) surface roughness could also affect mr through the weak localization suppression @xcite , however , this mechanism is hardly relevant because it produces a negative mr in contrast to our observations .",
    "experimentally , we observe a picture opposite to the common sense arguments : parallel field magnetoresistance is strongly suppressed when sample is rotated in fixed total field .",
    "this observation is not a property of particular studied samples , rather , there are numerous examples in literature where strong positive mr in parallel field coexists with almost shallow or even negative mr in perpendicular or tilted field : for p - gaas  @xcite , strained si  @xcite , si / sige quantum wells  @xcite . dramatic delocalizing effect of the perpendicular field was also reported for high mobility si - mosfet samples in the low - density / high resistivity ( @xmath164 ) regime in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition  @xcite . such behavior is not explained at all , and the question why parallel field mr is suppressed by the perpendicular field component remains open .",
    "we believe that the parallel field magnetoresistance suppression in perpendicular field is somehow related to the low - field hall feature ( region a in fig .",
    "[ perpfield]g ) .",
    "the empiric crossover between the low- and high - field regimes @xmath165 points to the localization - related nature of the low - field hall feature .",
    "we , therefore , suggest the following model : a small part of electrons is localizedin low binding - energy states and coexist with mobile electrons . we stress that these states are different from conventional tail of localized states located below the mobility edge @xcite .",
    "the localized electrons do not contribute to hall effect at @xmath166 because they can be treated as zero mobility carriers .",
    "let us assume also that the localized states promote strong parallel field mr .",
    "this assumption does not contradict to the empirical observations of the disorder effect in mr @xcite .",
    "application of perpendicular field changes the symmetry class of the system , favors delocalization of these electrons and hence decreases the response of a 2d system to parallel magnetic field .",
    "such explanation initiates questions about the source of 10 - 30% electrons that are out of the game at @xmath166 and about their influence on the parallel field mr .",
    "the tilted field approach suggested in this paper might be applied for similar study of eec with high - mobility si - mosfets where strong metallic conductivity ( @xmath167 ) and metal - insulator transition are considered to be driven by the eec @xcite .",
    "this task is however rather challenging experimentally because it requires a combination of millikelvin temperatures ( to insure the deep diffusive limit @xmath10 for an order of magnitude higher mobility samples ) , field sweep and sample rotation .",
    "in this paper we applied phenomenological technique of resistivity tensor analysis to check long - standing prediction by lee and ramakrishnan  @xcite about zeeman splitting dependence of the electron - electron interaction correction ( eec ) to conductivity in the diffusive regime @xmath168 .",
    "our measurements reveal distinctly different behaviors of the magnetotransport in the two domains of perpendicular field , the low @xmath118-field ( lf ) and the high @xmath118-field ( hf ) one .    in the lf domain ,",
    "the 2d system demonstrates a strong and @xmath18-dependent magnetoresistance versus @xmath169 field , whereas the hall angle exceeds the drude value by up to 30% , depends on @xmath118 , and grows as @xmath18 decreases .",
    "this hall anomaly obscures determination of the quantum interaction correction from the magnetotransport data in the lf domain .    in the hf domain ,",
    "the hall anomaly is washed - out by the @xmath118 field that enables extracting the interaction quantum correction from experimental data .",
    "the eec was found to be field direction independent , and linear in both @xmath150 and @xmath15 , as expected .    remarkably , the magnitude of the experimentally determined eec appeared to be more than a factor of 10 smaller than the parallel field magnetoconductance .",
    "thus , the parallel field mr observed in si - mosfets is not explained by the eec solely .",
    "even more surprisingly , the observed strong parallel field mr quickly diminishes when the perpendicular field component is applied on top of the parallel field .",
    "this fact is the direct evidence for non - purely zeeman origin of the parallel field magnetoresistance .    in total ,",
    "our findings point at the incompleteness of the existing theory of magnetotransport in interacting and disordered 2d systems : too strong parallel field magnetoresistance , its suppression by perpendicular magnetic field , and the low - field hall anomaly require an explanation .",
    "we believe that these three phenomena are interrelated and originate from a destructive action of the perpendicular field on the localized states .",

    "the low field hall feature is thus unexpected in theory , though its experimental observation is not surprising .",
    "the lack of agreement between low - field hall resistance and quantum correction theory was first pointed by ovadyahu @xcite and reported several times since then @xcite .",
    "although there are some theoretically suggested mechanisms @xcite , this phenomenon is still poorly understood .",
    "let us briefly summarize our experimental observations of the low - field nonlinearity in the hall resistance in si - mosfets : ( i ) the effect weakens as temperature increases ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ 15tesla ] ) ; ( ii ) the amplitude of the effect may achieve @xmath177 at low temperatures , i.e. variations in the hall angle are as large as 30% ; ( iii ) the @xmath107 dependence is determined by perpendicular field component . to prove this we compare in fig .",
    "7 @xmath107 for perpendicular field orientation , @xmath122 and @xmath107 for @xmath178 ; ( iv ) the field range , where the hall resistance is nonlinear , broadens as density ( and hence conductivity ) decreases .",
    "( v ) the effect is observed in low - mobility si - mosfets ( @xmath179  m@xmath21/vs ) in the temperature range @xmath180k ( @xmath181 ) . for high mobility samples ( @xmath182  m@xmath21/vs ) we did nt observe any nonlinearity in the hall resistance down to 0.05k ( @xmath183 )",
    ".    it might be that the low - field hall nonlinearity is somehow related to weak localization , though weak localization itself does not produce correction to hall coefficient .",
    "indeed , let us estimate transport field @xmath184 , ( @xmath185 ) , that is the typical value of perpendicular field component where weak localization is suppressed . by substituting the transport",
    "mean free path @xmath96 from the drude formula @xmath186 for a two - valley system , we get : @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the dimensionless drude resistivity , and @xmath189 for simplicity was taken equal to @xmath190 ; this simplification is justified for @xmath191  kohm . for practical use @xmath192= 0.062\\times n[10^{12 } { \\rm cm}^{-2}]\\times ( \\rho_d[{\\rm kohm}])^2 $ ] .",
    "the coincidence of the estimated @xmath193 t value for the most intensively discussed density @xmath99@xmath31 with characteristic field of the hall anomaly suppression at the lowest temperature ( see figs .  1 , 3 , 4 ) points to the relationship between weak localization and the anomalous low - field hall slope .",
    "observation ( iv ) is in line with this scenario , because growth of the resistivity pushes @xmath194 to higher fields .",
    "a mechanism of the weak - localization - related low - field nonlinearity in the hall resistance was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effect was interpreted as the second - order correction to conductivity ; i.e. a crossed term of the eec ( which controls the amplitude of the effect ) and weak localization ( which controls the magnetic field dependence ) . in our case , however , the sign of the effect is opposite to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the amplitude of the effect is much stronger .    similar sign of the effect ( i.e. hall coefficient decreasing with field down to its nominal value @xmath195 ) follows from memory effects @xcite .",
    "however , the memory effects do not produce temperature dependent correction to hall effect , as we observed .",
    "interaction in the cooper ( particle - particle ) channel @xcite produces the so - called dos correction that is suppressed in magnetic fields of the order of @xmath196 , similar to what is seen in experiment .",
    "the observed effect however is too big to be explained by quantum correction : indeed , were the hall nonlinearity , @xmath197 , caused by dos correction , one would observe an enormous temperature dependence of the conductivity ( of the insulting sign ) at zero field @xmath198 , much stronger than both , eec and weak localization .",
    "the absence of such temperature dependence in our data points to the irrelevance of the dos correction to the observed weak field hall anomaly .",
    "another model that might explain field dependent hall effect is a classical multi - component system .",
    "however , this model can hardly be applicable to our data because the hall coefficient nonlinearity should be accompanied with a large positive magnetoresistance , and should occur in fields @xmath199 , i.e. much higher than we observe .",
