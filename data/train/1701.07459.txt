    "dark matter ( dm ) density profiles in dwarf galaxies have long been debated .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , observations proposed that dwarf galaxies seem to have nearly constant densities of dm at their central regions (  cusp / core problem ",
    ", e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as a possible solution ,",
    "if dm haloes consist of warm or self - interacting particles , all dwarf galaxies are expected to have central dm cores .",
    "it has also been proposed , alternatively , that ( recursive ) baryonic feedback can turn a cusp into a core by flattening the inner slopes of the primordial dm density profiles in dwarf galaxies as massive as @xmath4@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the latter scenario is the case , since dynamical masses of some ultra - faint dwarf galaxies ( ufds ) in the local group have been observed to be significantly smaller than the mass threshold above which the baryonic effect is influential to their central dm densities , they could be expected to preserve the primordial dm density profiles which may be cuspy .",
    "accordingly , it is interesting to try to determine dm density profiles of such low - mass ufds .",
    "it is , however , still impossible to know whether their dm haloes have cusps or cores because of only a handful of stars observable by spectroscopy to measure their line - of - sight velocities ( losvs ) and model their dm haloes .",
    "hence , it is worthwhile looking for an alternative method to deduce which type of dm the low - mass galaxies have , cusp or core .",
    "for example , @xcite have proposed a method using a fraction of wide binaries which can be disrupted by tidal force depending on their dm potential in ufds .",
    "the smallest ufds are as tiny as @xmath6 in half - light radius and @xmath7 in luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although current observations still can not reject the possibility that some of them are extended globular clusters .",
    "recently , @xcite has analytically discussed that dynamical friction ( df ) on a star against dark matter may be marginally effective on the timescale of @xmath8 in draco ii  observed physical properties of which are @xmath9 , brightness @xmath10 , losv dispersion @xmath11 measured within @xmath12 @xcite  by adopting the chandrasekhar df formula @xcite to his singular isothermal dm halo model .",
    "his result implies that df against dm could significantly change stellar distribution in ufds more compact and/or less massive than draco ii , which will be discovered by future observations .",
    "the effect of df strongly depends on the dm density profile .",
    "it has been known that df drag force becomes significantly weaker in cored density distribution than in cuspy one , once a massive particle enters the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "studies using @xmath2-body simulations have demonstrated that drag force by df does cease practically in a constant - density core , probably by non - linear effects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , if an extremely low - mass ufd has a constant - density core of dm , df could be too weak to affect the stellar distribution .",
    "on the other hand , if such a ufd has a dm cusp , df against dm could be strong enough to make alterations to its stellar distribution , such as emergence of a stellar cusp or formation of a nucleus cluster as a remnant of stars fallen into the galactic centre .",
    "current observations of low - mass compact ufds are limited to a close distance of @xmath13 from the sun because of their faintness . at this distance ,",
    "each star in a ufd can be resolved since the typical size of observational smearing is smaller than the mean separation of stars even at the galactic centres .",
    "therefore , the expected stellar cusp and the nucleus cluster would be observed as a dense group of stars at the galactic centre if it exists .",
    "this study addresses the effect of df by dm on stellar distribution in an extremely low - mass and compact ufd and focus on how different it is between cuspy and cored dm density profiles . in section [ analysis ] , i perform analytical estimation of stellar shrivelling due to df based on a classical and a modern df formulae . in section [ simsec ] , i perform @xmath2-body simulations resolving every single star and demonstrate the same as the analytical estimation presented in section [ analysis ] . finally , i present discussion and summary of this work in section [ discussion ] .",

    "in addition , the number of stars in the central region where stars can reach the centre by df within @xmath8 depends on the initial stellar distribution , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath12 .",

    "the black line delineates the analytic model of the dm distribution ( equation [ density ] with @xmath18 ) . ]",
    "as i showed in section [ analysis ] and [ simsec ] , df on stars against dm can largely alter the stellar density distribution if the galaxy has cuspy dm distribution and a compact stellar component having @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "the most important result obtained from my @xmath2-body simulations is that the df by the dm cusp can arouse emergence of a stellar cusp in the galactic centre @xmath3 . on the other hand , if a dm halo has a core , df is not efficient to generate such a stellar cusp , in spite of the same @xmath37 , although stellar density can be affected and increase slightly in a wide range @xmath162 .",
    "the results mentioned above can be explained by the differences of density and velocity dispersion between a cuspy and a cored dm haloes . according to the analytic formulae ,",
    "df becomes stronger when a background density is higher and a velocity dispersion is lower . in a cuspy halo ,",
    "dm density increases toward the centre , and velocity dispersion decreases ( see fig . [ velocities ] ) , therefore df becomes stronger towards the centre . in this case ,",
    "orbital shrinkage by df brings a star to an inner region where df is even stronger : ` df shrivelling instability ' @xcite . on the other hand , in a cored halo , density and velocity dispersion are nearly constant in the central region",
    ", therefore df drag force is approximately independent of radius ; it actually decreases gently towards the centre ( fig .",
    "[ cf_comp ] ) .",
    "this means that a cored halo is relatively stable against the df shrivelling of stars .",
    "interpretation of the above results should be considered carefully .",
    "it should be noted that presence of a stellar cusp in a low - mass compact ufd is not necessarily evidence to prove a dm cusp .",
    "it is because we do not know the initial condition of the stellar density ; a galaxy can create a stellar cusp at its birth even if its dm halo has a core .",
    "it could be said , however , that it is inevitable to have a stellar cusp if a low - mass compact ufd has a dm cusp .",
    "in other words , if a low - mass compact ufd is observed to have no stellar cusp and be old enough , it suggests that its dm halo would have a large core with a size of @xmath163 .",
    "i discuss ufds in current observations on this point in section [ obs ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results of the analytic formulae with those of @xmath2-body simulations although it is not the main purpose of this study .",
    "early studies using numerical simulations have discussed that the chandrasekhar formula assuming maxwellian velocity distribution and a invariant @xmath68 can give a quite accurate estimate of df force in various cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was also reported , however , that the formula can be inaccurate in some specific cases ; analyses and @xmath2-body simulations have shown that df can be enhanced around a constant - density core , and then suppressed in the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these phenomena are inconsistent with predictions by the simplified chandrasekhar formula .",
    "various physical mechanisms of the deviation from the analytic formula have been proposed : orbital resonance between a massive and field particles @xcite , coherent velocity field among particles @xcite , a non - maxwellian velocity distribution @xcite , decrease of low - velocity particles @xcite and inhomogeneity of background density and a variable @xmath68 @xcite .    in the case of a dm cusp ,",
    "the two analytic formulae predict similar df force in fig .",
    "[ cf_comp ] , and the results of my orbital integration models are qualitatively consistent with the @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "however , the stellar cusp in my @xmath2-body simulations have the size of @xmath164 , and it could be attributed to the weakened dm cusp shown in fig .",
    "[ dmcusp ] , where df is weakened .",
    "in addition , the dm density centre is not necessarily be fixed onto the stellar centre in the simulations , and the slippage of the centres can broaden the stellar cusp . therefore , the broadness of the stellar cusp in the simulations does not necessarily mean inaccuracy of the df modellings .",
    "however , the stellar density slopes outside the stellar cusp is steeper in the orbital integration models .",
    "moreover , in my @xmath2-body simulations , the total mass of the stellar cusps within @xmath165 are about four times smaller than those predicted by the analytic df modellings . on these points",
    ", both analytic formulae would be overestimating df in the cuspy haloes .    in the case of a dm core , on the other hand , df can not generate a stellar cusp in either the orbital integration or the @xmath2-body models .",
    "however , there is a difference worthy of special mention : the simplified chandrasekhar formula hardly changes the stellar density slopes , whereas the @xmath2-body simulations show significant increase of the stellar densities in a wide range of @xmath166 ( fig .",
    "[ nbody ] ) .",
    "this result shows that the chandrasekhar formula assuming maxwellian distribution and a invariable @xmath68 underestimates df in the cored halo despite that the classical formula overestimates in the cuspy halo .",
    "it is noteworthy that using the petts et al .",
    "formula with their tidal - stalling model can dramatically improve the reproducibility of df effect in the cored haloes , and the result of the stellar density profile is almost consistent with the @xmath2-body simulations ( see the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ oi_hernq ] and [ nbody ] ) .",
    "thus , the df modelling proposed by @xcite seems to be more accurate than the simplified chandrasekhar formula although it may not be perfect yet in a dm cusp .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this study to investigate the physical reasons of the differences between the analytic formulae and my @xmath2-body simulations , i consider that the @xmath2-body simulations would be physically more credible than the analytic models .",
    "here , i discuss the validity of my models of low - mass compact ufds and the results in comparison with current observations .",
    "first , it is still very difficult or impossible to determine masses and sizes of dm haloes of ufds with accuracy in current observations .",
    "i have to note , therefore , that the parameters in my dm halo models might be arbitrary .",
    "recent observational studies have argued that galaxies have the universal dm surface density , @xmath167 , over quite a wide range of luminosity when they are assumed to have cored dm haloes @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derived @xmath168 and @xmath169 from their galaxy samples including some satellite galaxies of the milky way .",
    "although it has to be noted that they assumed different models for their cored haloes , my cored dm models of equation ( [ density ] ) have @xmath170 and @xmath171 for @xmath42 and @xmath172 , respectively , when @xmath55 .",
    "accordingly , my cored halo model with @xmath42@xmath172 and @xmath55 would be consistent with the observed universality of @xmath173 if it is extrapolated to extremely low - mass galaxies .    for my stellar model",
    ", i assume the uniform stellar mass of @xmath98 .",
    "however , of course , stars generally have different masses according to their initial mass function and stellar evolution .",
    "although stellar scattering by massive stars would not be efficient since encounters between stars are expected to be rare in a low - mass compact ufd ( see appendix [ collision ] ) , mass segregation does occur on the same timescale as df because of mass - dependence of df . because more massive stars sink faster into the centre of a dm cusp",
    ", a stellar cusp would mainly consist of massive stars .. ] the massive objects in the stellar cusp could be a heating source of less massive stars around it and prevent the less massive stars from falling into the centre .",
    "thus , i have to note that my @xmath2-body simulations lack this effect .    the best ufd that is the most similar to my @xmath2-body model ( @xmath160 , @xmath55 and @xmath174 ) would be draco ii , which has @xmath175 , @xmath11 , the total luminosity @xmath176 and an age @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "although the most probable value of @xmath37 observed is nearly twice higher than that in my model , it is within the error range .",
    "if i adopt a stellar mass - to - luminosity ratio @xmath178@xmath179 for a metal - poor system of @xmath180 from a simple stellar population model of @xcite , the stellar mass of draco ii is approximately @xmath181@xmath182 . at the heliocentric distance of draco ii , @xmath183 @xcite , the size of a stellar cusp expected from my @xmath2-body simulations , @xmath184 , corresponds to @xmath185 .",
    "unfortunately , the cusp region is smaller than the size of the innermost bin of a stellar surface density profile shown in fig . 3 of @xcite , therefore it might be still challenging for the current observations to detect a stellar cusp in draco ii even if it is present .",
    "in addition , the observed number of stars belonging to draco ii may be too small to excavate a stellar cusp in the current observations .",
    "although dm density profiles of ufds may differ from one another even if they have the same sizes and losv dispersions , it could improve statistics for proving absence of stellar cusps to make a stacking like fig .",
    "[ nbody ] among ufds having similar and sufficiently small @xmath12 and @xmath37 .",
    "because of the faintness of ufds as small as draco ii , observations are limited to the close distance from the solar system : @xmath13 .",
    "it could be expected , however , that future observations will explore vaster regions to discover such faint ufds .",
