    "recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in controlling molecular and atomic processes @xcite .",
    "the central principle of coherent control ( cc ) teaches that such control can be achieved by using coherent laser fields to induce constructive or destructive interference between multiple indistinguishable pathways to the same final state .",
    "the yield of desired or undesired product can thus be enhanced or suppressed by manipulating the resultant quantum interference terms . thus far , most experimental and theoretical studies of cc of atomic and molecular processes have focused on unimolecular reactions or half collisions , such as photodissociation , photoionization and photoassociation .    by contrast",
    ", controlling full collision processes such as atom - atom scattering , atom - molecule scattering , and molecule - molecule scattering remains a significant challenge .",
    "existent studies along this direction have largely employed a number of approaches @xcite .",
    "the first @xcite actively manipulates coherent light sources to alter the interaction potential of the colliding particles .",
    "for example , in ultracold atom - atom collisions , the scattering cross sections can be extensively modified by using laser fields that are in near resonance with one of the excited molecular electronic states @xcite , or by employing a d.c .",
    "field that induces an additional dipole - dipole interaction potential @xcite .",
    "however , it appears difficult to use this approach to control atom - molecule or molecule - molecule scattering , since the number of degrees of freedom is much larger than that in atom - atom scattering .",
    "a second approach is laser catalysis @xcite in which the laser field photons serve as a catalyst . in this case",
    "the laser accelerates ( or suppresses ) the reaction by inducing a barrier hopping process , via a virtual excitation to a bound excited state , while remaining unchanged at the end of the event .",
    "the third approach , which is the subject of this study , is coherent control @xcite .",
    "although the general theory of collisional cc has been worked out @xcite and conditions for control established @xcite the experimental problem remains as to how one can introduce the required adjustable quantum phases and amplitudes into coherent scattering processes in a fashion so as to introduce control based upon quantum interference .",
    "that is , several recent studies on cc of collisions in model scattering systems @xcite make clear that , for collisions of non - identical molecules , coherent control requires that one establish subtle quantum correlations between the translational and internal degrees of freedom of the reactants .",
    "setting up the required initial states presents an experimental challenge , since it requires coherent matter - wave beams in which the internal states of the molecule are correlated in a precise way with the translational states .",
    "such correlated translational - internal states are not required , however , if one attempts coherent control in the collision of identical molecules , i.e. , ab + ab . rather , it suffices @xcite to prepare the reactants in superpositions of initial rovibrational states . in this case , in accord with ref .",
    "@xcite , the collision cross sections can be controlled by manipulating the character of the initial coherent superposition states in which the molecules are prepared .    in this paper",
    "we examine the coherent control of identical particle scattering in detail , with para ",
    "h@xmath0 + para  h@xmath0 as an example .",
    "in doing so we approach this issue from a different perspective from that in our earlier work @xcite , demonstrating deep connections to the construction and use of _ entangled states _ , a topic of great recent interest in quantum information science @xcite .",
    "that is , we show that the scattering amplitudes , and the resultant differential and total collision cross sections , depend strongly on quantum entanglement embedded in the initial rovibrational state .",
    "in essence , entanglement - induced quantum effects are shown to occur without the explicit preparation of entangled states .",
    "this provides a novel means of controlling both the the differential and total collision cross sections in identical diatom - diatom scattering .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s5 - 2 ] , we introduce some concepts related to quantum entanglement between identical particles and then address the theory of identical diatom - diatom scattering with particular reference to entangled molecular rovibrational states as the incoming asymptotic states .",
    "the theoretical formalism is presented in sec .",

    "results for the scattering of this system are shown in sec .",
    "[ s5 - 3 ] where detailed computational results on the role of entangled rovibrational states in both elastic and inelastic scattering , with the collision energy ranging from @xmath1 @xmath2 to the ultracold regime , are explored .",
    "a discussion is provided in sec .",
    "[ s5 - 4 ] .",
    "quantum entanglement is a striking feature of quantum physics .",
    "qualitatively , two particles are said to be quantum entangled if their total wavefunction is inseparable .",
    "in particular , if two particles are entangled then neither of them possesses a complete set of properties , since measuring one of them would collapse the total wavefunction and thus affect the properties of the other .",
    "quantum entanglement is a fundamental issue of considerable theoretical interest , and plays a key role in various modern areas such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography , and quantum computing @xcite .    in the case of identical particles",
    "the total wavefunction , including all degrees of freedom , is always symmetrized or anti - symmetrized with respect to particle exchange .",
    "hence , even if the total wavefunction of two identical particles is simply obtained by symmetrizing ( or anti - symmetrizing ) a separable state , it appears to be unfactorizable , and hence apparently entangled .",
    "this is , in fact , misleading and hints that quantum entanglement between identical particles is somewhat more subtle than quantum entanglement between non - identical particles . in a recent discussion ,",
    "ghirardi et al @xcite have given clear definitions of quantum entanglement between two identical particles : ( i ) two identical fermions are entangled if the total wavefunction can not be obtained by anti - symmetrizing a factorized state , and ( ii ) two identical bosons are entangled if the total wavefunction can not be obtained by symmetrizing a factorized product of two orthogonal states and if the total wavefunction is not a product of the same state for the two particles . under these circumstances ,",
    "the state is entangled and each of the particle pairs does not possess a full set of properties .",
    "one intriguing aspect of quantum entanglement between identical particles , relevant to the discussion below , is that it can force different permutation symmetries on some degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , consider a system of two freely moving identical spin @xmath3 particles , whose spin up and spin down states are represented by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "if the total spin is zero , then the two spins are entangled and the resulting (  epr state \" ) @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 note that @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ spinepr ] ) can not be obtained by anti - symmetrizing a factorizable _ total _ wavefunction ( since such an anti - symmetrized state should also describe the translational motion ) of two spin @xmath3 particles . clearly , @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ spinepr ] ) acquires a factor of @xmath10 upon permutation .",
    "since the permutation symmetry for the total wavefunction including all degrees of freedom is @xmath10 for identical fermions , the permutation symmetry of the spatial degrees of freedom must be @xmath11 .",
    "thus , in a simple bound system such as para ",
    "h@xmath0 , the rotational quantum number has to be even .",
    "likewise , in unbound cases such as electron - electron or proton - proton scattering , the differential cross sections do depend strongly on how the two spins are entangled , even if the scattering potential is spin independent , e.g. , a pure coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "this selection of specific permutation symmetry combinations due to entanglement of a subset of the system degrees of freedom is central to the results below .",
    "consider identical particle scattering .",
    "we focus on the diatom - diatom case ab + ab , but the considerations are general . if @xmath12 denotes an eigenstate of the ab diatom with angular momentum quantum number @xmath13 , angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath14 and vibrational quantum number @xmath15 , then a typical entangled ro - vibrational state of ab + ab is of the form @xmath16 of specific interest later below are the entangled states @xmath17 where the only distinction between the two states @xmath18 is the relative phase @xmath19 ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) between the two participating states @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this difference is significant insofar as @xmath24 is invariant upon permutation of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , whereas @xmath27 acquires a factor of @xmath10 upon permutation of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it should be stressed that the permutation symmetry associated with @xmath18 has nothing to with the permutation symmetry of the total wavefunction of identical particles , since the states @xmath18 describe only rotational and vibrational motion .",
    "note also , for use later below , that entangled states @xmath18 also form a new set of basis states to describe a general entangled state , i.e. , @xmath28    suppose that prior to the ab + ab collision the ab molecules ( here labeled ab and ab@xmath29 for convenience ) are prepared , in accord with ref .",
    "@xcite , in the superposition states : @xmath30 then the total internal wavefunction ( before symmetrization ) is a direct product @xmath31 of these two superposition states , rather than an entangled molecular state .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath31 can be expressed in terms of an entangled state plus two additional components , i.e. , @xmath32   |j_{2}m_{2}v_{2}\\rangle\\otimes   |j_{2}m_{2}v_{2}\\rangle ,   \\label{psidp }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the entangled state component @xmath33 is given by eq .",
    "( [ psiab ] ) , with @xmath34 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\beta & = & \\beta_{1}-\\beta_{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the two additional components @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 in the prepared diatomic state , one can alter the initial state .",
    "this introduces controllable quantum interferences , as previously discussed @xcite , hence altering product cross sections",
    ".    alternatively , if our interest is in the dynamics of entangled states then collisions of ab + ab in the prescribed initial states may well provide a route to directly observing entanglement - induced quantum effects .",
    "specifically , there clearly are cases , some cited in computations below , where contributions from the entangled molecular state dominate over that of the satellite states . that is , for some channels characterized by @xmath38 , the scattering amplitude for the initial direct product state @xmath31 is entirely due to the @xmath39 component . for these cases , we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the differential cross section summed over @xmath42 and @xmath43 and integrated over the azimuthal angle @xmath44 for the initial state @xmath8 . alternatively , and more difficult to implement , if we restrict the measurement to a particular total energy of the product , contributions of the satellite states can be zero due to the energy restriction and the scattering becomes essentially that due to an initially entangled molecular state @xmath45 .",
    "thus , significantly , in either case one can experimentally observe and utilize entanglement - assisted coherent control effects in diatom - diatom scattering without the difficult task of preparing entangled molecular states .",
    "below we develop a general description of the quantum effects associated with entanglement of molecular rovibrational motion in bimolecular scattering .",
    "we focus on the contribution from the entangled state since the remainder ( i.e. , the satellite terms ) is ordinary scattering . in doing",
    "so we specifically study the scattering system para  h@xmath0 + para- h@xmath0 , the simplest case of diatom - diatom scattering .",
    "although many of the following arguments apply to both reactive and nonreactive scattering , we confine attention to elastic and inelastic scattering only .",
    "consider ab + ab scattering .",
    "we represent the vector pointing from the center of mass of the projectile to that of the target by @xmath46 , and the relative inter - atomic distance vectors of the two para  h@xmath0 molecules by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath47 to denote the quantum numbers of angular momentum , the projection of angular momentum onto a space - fixed @xmath48 axis , and vibrational motion , respectively , for each para  h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the fact that both the nuclear spin and the electronic spin of para  h@xmath0 molecules are zero greatly simplifies the problem , while retaining the essence of physics . note that each para ",
    "h@xmath0 molecule ( with electronic ground state ) is a boson , so that the permutation symmetry of the total wavefunction @xmath49 in the scattering problem is @xmath11 .",
    "that is , @xmath50 as we shall see more clearly below , this implies that the parity of @xmath51 with regard to @xmath46 depends on the permutation symmetry of the internal degrees of freedom @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in traditional scattering",
    ", the initial state is characterized by @xmath52 @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and the final state characterized by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the translational momenta for the initial and final states , with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) in the case of elastic ( inelastic ) scattering .",
    "below we exclude the case of @xmath61 as it does not allow for entanglement in rovibrational states . since the colliding molecules are identical , both the incoming and the outgoing asymptotic states have to be appropriately symmetrized .",
    "however , to obtain the scattering amplitude it suffices to symmetrize either the incoming or outgoing state only @xcite . if we choose to symmetrize the incoming state then the scattering amplitude is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the unsymmetrized scattering amplitudes under the assumption that the two molecules are distinguishable . specifically , in terms of the @xmath64-matrix elements , we have @xcite @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the spherical function and @xmath68 are the clebsch - gordan coefficient .",
    "consider now the case where the molecules are initially prepared in an entangled state of molecular rovibrational states ( as in the cross term in eq .",

    "the two components of @xmath70 shown in eq .",
    "( [ entangled ] ) are degenerate in energy .",
    "hence they can interfere with each other , providing interference effects that allow for control .    to simplify matters we focus on the role of the entangled states @xmath18 .",
    "consideration of three special cases is in order :    \\(a ) @xmath71 , @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 in this case entanglement arises only through molecular rotation motion along a space fixed axis .",
    "case ( a ) is therefore totally analogous to two entangled spins [ see eq . ( [ spinepr ] ) ] .",

    "\\(b ) @xmath74 , @xmath75 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath76 here only vibrational motion is entangled ; rotational motion is completely separable .",
    "further , unlike case ( a ) , the resulting quantum entanglement is entirely due to internal excitation .",
    "\\(c ) @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 this case is somewhat complicated .",
    "equation ( [ en3 ] ) implies that , while vibrational motion is not entangled , rotational degrees of freedom are partially entangled , insofar as the motion along a space fixed axis is still separable .",
    "note that in this case quantum entanglement is also due to internal excitation , and that it is intrinsically different from case ( a ) and unrelated to any description based on polarization theory .",

    "this leads to a significant difference in the total inelastic cross section @xmath173 for the @xmath132 cases : @xmath174 @xmath144 and @xmath175 @xmath144 , giving a control range of @xmath17657% , where @xmath177 is the total inelastic cross section for scattering from ab(@xmath178 ) + ab ( @xmath146 ) to the channel @xmath160 .",
    "however , @xmath179 is less than 2% at the higher energies in fig .",

    "this new area of focus , ultracold molecular scattering , has already displayed interesting quantum effects @xcite .",
    "further , understanding this area is also crucial in realizing molecular bose - einstein condensation @xcite .    from the control point of view",
    ", the advantage of ultracold collisions is that scattering cross sections are often dominated by very few partial waves .",
    "this feature of ultracold collisions may well allow for new opportunities in manipulating molecular collisions @xcite .",
    "for example , the fact that entangled incoming molecular states impose parity restrictions on the partial waves [ see eq .",
    "( [ ftmatrix ] ) ] implies that quantum entanglement should be even more important at ultracold temperatures .",
    "consider , for example , a zero collision energy limit case where only s - wave scattering ( @xmath98 partial wave ) contributes to the cross sections @xcite . in this case , if s - wave scattering is selected by molecular entanglement , the result would be enhanced nonzero cross sections .",
    "if s - wave scattering is forbidden due to molecular entanglement , then molecular scattering is completely suppressed .",
    "that is , in the elastic scattering case , all the scattering would be in the forward direction , and in the completely suppressed inelastic scattering case , there would be no inelastic scattering in any direction .",
    "to confirm such theoretical considerations and to determine how cold the collisions need be in order to experimentally observe such extreme quantum effects , we extend our calculations to the ultracold regime , with @xmath134 ranging from @xmath181 @xmath2 to @xmath182 @xmath2 .",
    "these computations are generally easier than at higher energies because the maximum total angular momentum contributing to cross sections is very small @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5 - 3 ] shows @xmath130 for two energies [ @xmath183 @xmath2 and @xmath184 @xmath2 ] , with the incoming asymptotic states given by @xmath132 @xmath186 . in both cases @xmath130 for @xmath137 ( dashed line ) is fairly uniform suggesting that s - wave dominates the elastic scattering . thus , preventing s - wave scattering via entanglement is expected to cause a dramatic decrease in the cross section . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 3]b , one sees that elastic scattering is almost totally suppressed for the @xmath138 case .",

    "[ fig5 - 3]b .",
    "figure [ fig5 - 4 ] shows sample results for ultracold inelastic scattering . as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 2 ] , @xmath132 @xmath189 is chosen as the incoming asymptotic state and we examine transitions to @xmath190 with collision energies of @xmath184 @xmath2 and @xmath182 @xmath2 . the differences in @xmath157 between @xmath137 and @xmath191 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 4]a is somewhat similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 2]c , where the collision energy is @xmath192 times larger , with a corresponding @xmath179 of 22% . hence , control is significant , but the system is insufficiently cold to show _ extreme _ quantum effects . by contrast ,",
    "[ fig5 - 4]b shows results for the lowest @xmath134 of @xmath182 @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , in this case , inelastic scattering for @xmath138 is almost completely suppressed , whereas inelastic scattering for @xmath137 remains significant .",
    "the integrated cross sections give @xmath193 @xmath149 and @xmath194 @xmath149 , with a @xmath179=194% .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that quantum entanglement in the incoming asymptotic state can dramatically alter ultracold collision cross sections .",
    "these effects will also appear in the scattering of the superposition states in eq .",
    "( [ sups ] ) .",
    "that is , eq .",
    "( [ sigmaeq ] ) is well obeyed in all of the cases shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 - 1 ] to [ fig5 - 4 ] . for example , in the elastic scattering case ( @xmath195 , @xmath159 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 ) the scattering amplitude for the @xmath201 @xmath202 transition due to the first satellite state is orders of magnitude smaller than that for the @xmath133 @xmath202 transition associated with the entangled state term at the @xmath203 considered .",
    "the probability of the transition @xmath204 @xmath202 due to the second satellite state is also negligible ( indeed , it is exactly zero for @xmath205 @xmath2 ) .",
    "similarly , for the inelastic scattering case ( @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath206 ) , the scattering amplitude due to the first satellite , the de - excitation @xmath207 @xmath208@xmath190 , is negligible due to the large rotational energy mismatch between the initial and final channels . in addition , the second satellite state does not contribute to the product channel @xmath209 for @xmath210 @xmath2 .",
    "thus , for example if , in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaeq ] ) , @xmath211 , then eq . ( [ sigmaeq ] ) reduces to @xmath212 in this case the role of @xmath19 as a control parameter , evident in eq . ( [ b1b2 ] ) as a method for switching between the plus and minus states , is worthy of note .",
    "for example , the elastic scattering results in fig . [",
    "fig5 - 3]b show that by varying @xmath19 one can enhance , or almost completely suppress , the yield of the @xmath213 channel in directions other than that of the incident momentum .",
    "likewise , the inelastic scattering results in fig . [ fig5 - 4]b suggest that by manipulating @xmath19 we can enhance or almost shut off the @xmath214 channel .",
    "the above discussion provides results on rotational energy transfer .",
    "the formalism , however , applies equally well to other types of scattering .",
    "unfortunately , the current state - of - the - computational - art prevents a full quantum calculation on reactive scattering , or even on diatom - diatom rovibrational energy transfer .",
    "that is , the exact numerical treatment of @xmath215 + @xmath215 in three dimensions is still not feasible and approximations such as the sudden approximation @xcite may not be appropriate for low energy collisions of the type that we are examining since it assumes that molecular rotation is slow compared with that of vibration and translation . further , although a semiclassical treatment of rovibrational energy transfer is available @xcite it ignores the role of the quantum effects in the translational motion .",
    "nonetheless , we wish to gain some insight into phase control of vibrational relaxation . for this reason we present results on a simplified model of diatom - diatom scattering where the rotational motion is frozen .",
    "specifically , we adopt a three - degree - of - freedom model that assumes that both the projectile and target molecules point at a fixed direction during the entire scattering process .",
    "the scattering problem is then computationally solved by wavepacket propagation .",
    "to do so we employ a time - dependent approach with real @xmath216 eigenfunctions with damping @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5 - 5 ] displays the transition probability to the product @xmath217 channel for three initial entangled vibrational states characterized by @xmath218 with @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath21 , respectively . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 5 ] , the quantum phase @xmath19 embedded in the initial entangled vibrational states strongly affects vibration - vibration relaxation , with the cross section changing considerably as a function of the initial entangled state .",
    "the results on para  h@xmath0 + para  h@xmath0 scattering make clear that entanglement can play a significant role in the control of nonreactive collisional processes . to investigate this phenomenon",
    "experimentally one could attempt to prepare the entangled molecular state directly .",
    "however , although quantum entanglement of atomic systems has been experimentally realized @xcite , preparing entangled molecular states would require a considerable extension of technology .",
    "by contrast , contributions from entangled states appear naturally in the collision of ab + ab systems where the initial states are prepared as superpositions of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ sups ] ) . preparing these states would entail excitation of the @xmath124 to produce the superposition with @xmath221 . if the transition is dipole allowed then direct excitation of the lower state is possible .",
    "alternatively , stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite or the tripod - stirap scheme @xcite may provide a useful choice for preparing the superposition states for both the projectile and the target molecules .",
    "in the latter approach an additional laser couples the intermediate level ( through which the initial and final state are radiatively connected via the pump and stokes - laser ) with another unpopulated state . depending on the time overlap of the additional laser with that of the pump and stokes - laser , any coherent superposition state of the initial and final state can be created .",
    "thus , by introducing different coherence characteristics from laser fields into the scattering system , we can control @xmath19 and thus select the form of the entangled state component @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ psidp ] ) , giving rise to phase control over differential and total cross sections .",
    "our studies have been restricted to nonreactive scattering of ab + ab , with particular numerical application to para ",
    "h@xmath0 + para  h@xmath0 .",
    "as such , it remains to discuss the potential for applications to inelastic scattering of other systems and to comment on control of reactive scattering of identical particles .",
    "_ general inelastic @xmath215 + @xmath215 scattering : _ extensions to other inelastic scattering cases fall into two categories .",
    "the first are systems which , like para  h@xmath0 +",
    "h@xmath0 , have zero total nuclear spin , zero total electronic orbital angular momentum , and zero total electronic spin .",
    "the theory of these cases is described above and is directly applicable to inelastic scattering of other zero spin cases such as @xmath222 + @xmath222 , a system whose vibrational energy transfer is of interest in laser physics .",
    "however , the choice of zero spin merely simplifies theoretical considerations and it is not essential to control .    the second category , molecules with nonzero nuclear spin or electronic spin , does require an extension of the theory provided above . for such molecules , one of the two quantum effects due to entangled molecular states , i.e. , the parity selection of the incoming partial waves , may be substantially reduced when the nuclear or electronic spin is unpolarized . to see this note that the spin degree of freedom can introduce additional permutation symmetries into the system .",
    "thus , entangled rovibrational states like @xmath223 do not necessarily select the partial waves .",
    "for instance , for two unpolarized identical molecules with total integer nuclear spin @xmath224 , the permutation symmetry of all other degrees of freedom is @xmath11 with the probability @xmath225 and @xmath10 with the probability @xmath226 @xcite . when @xmath224 is large , two permutation symmetries of all other degrees of freedom are equally allowed . as a result",
    ", the permutation symmetry induced by entanglement of molecular rovibrational motion will have a negligible effect on the differential or total cross sections .",
    "however , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , one quantum effect still survives , i.e. , quantum interference between the transition amplitudes @xmath104 and @xmath105 . establishing the magnitude of this effect alone will require further study .    finally , note that there are considerable differences between the inelastic scattering case studied here and the case of reactive ab + ab scattering ( to form a@xmath0b + b or a@xmath0 + b@xmath0 ) , the subject of future research .",
    "a full treatment of reactive scattering , which does require considerable extensions of current computational technique , is under consideration .    in summary",
    ", we have examined the nature of the interference , and hence control , in nonreactive ab + ab scattering when the initial states are in a quantum superposition state .",
    "in doing so we have exposed the relationship of the interference term to entangled molecular rovibrational states as the incoming asymptotic state .",
    "intriguing quantum effects resulting from quantum entanglement are revealed , and are shown to provide a novel means of controlling both nonreactive differential and total cross sections in identical diatom - diatom scattering .",
