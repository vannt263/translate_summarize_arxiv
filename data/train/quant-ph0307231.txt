    "the dynamics of the total closed system can be extremely complicated .",
    "for this reason , since the very early days of quantum mechanics , a huge deal of attention has been devoted to the study of the dynamics of open quantum systems @xcite .    nowadays the interest in such a broad field",
    "has notably increased mainly for two reasons . on the one hand experimental advances in the coherent control of single or few atom systems",
    "have paved the way to the realization of the first basic elements of quantum computers , c - not @xcite and phase quantum gates @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the first quantum cryptographic @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite schemes have been experimentally implemented .",
    "these technological applications rely on the persistence of quantum coherence .",
    "thus , understanding decoherence and dissipation arising from the unavoidable interaction between the system and its surrounding is necessary in order to implement real - size quantum computers @xcite and quantum technologies . on the other hand , one of the most debated aspects of quantum mechanics , namely the quantum measurement problem ,",
    "can be interpreted in terms of environment induced decoherence @xcite . according to this interpretation the emergence of the classical world from the quantum world",
    "can be seen as a decoherence process due to the interaction between system and environment @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic model of the theory of open systems is a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled with a reservoir modelled as an infinite set of non interacting oscillators .",

    "how the reservoir affects the system dynamics one needs to make some assumptions on its nature and properties .",
    "some of these properties , as for example the temperature of the reservoir , can be experimentally measured .",
    "other parameters , as the reservoir spectral density or the system - reservoir coupling , are assumed on the basis of physical reasonableness and deduced by the comparison with experimental data . in this sense",
    "the model is a phenomenological one .",
    "the importance of the damped harmonic oscillator is also due to the fact that it is one of the few exactly solvable non - trivial systems .",
    "in fact the heisenberg equations of motion for the total system ( oscillator plus reservoir ) can easily be solved .",
    "the solution of the heisenberg equations of motion is indeed the most straightforward method for the description of the dynamics of the expectation values of observables of interest , e.g. the mean energy of the system .",
    "an example showing the easiness and conceptual transparency of the method is given in @xcite .",
    "another way to describe the time evolution of the system is to look at the reduced density matrix which is obtained by tracing the density matrix of the total system over the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "this procedure is motivated by the fact that , in general , one is interested only in the dynamics of the system and not in the state of the reservoir .",
    "an exact master equation for the reduced density matrix can be formulated and exactly solved @xcite .    during the last decade",

    "the idea of looking at the variation of the open system dynamics induced by the changes of the relevant reservoir parameters is in fact rather unusual .",
    "up to recently , indeed , only dissipation and/or decoherence due to interaction with the natural   reservoir were studied @xcite .",

    "in a previous paper we have presented a theory of heating for a single trapped ion interacting with a natural reservoir able to describe both its short time non - markovian behavior and the asymptotic thermalization process @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus instead on the case of interaction with engineered reservoirs . in the trapped ion context",

    "( [ gammasecord ] ) , one notices immediately that in the high temperature regime , @xmath39 . having this in mind",
    "it is easy to prove that the heating function , given by eq .",
    "( [ hf ] ) , may be written in the following approximated form @xmath40 where we have assumed that the initial state of the ion is its vibrational ground state , as it is actually the case at the end of the resolved sideband cooling process @xcite . for times much bigger than the reservoir correlation time @xmath41 the asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ hfhight ] ) is given by eq .",
    "( [ nm ] ) .",
    "this equation gives evidence for a second characteristic time of the dynamics , namely the thermalization time @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "the thermalization time depends both on the coupling strength and on the ratio @xmath44 between the reservoir cut - off frequency and the system oscillator frequency .",
    "usually , when one studies qbm , the condition @xmath45 , which corresponds to a natural flat reservoir , is assumed . in this case",
    "the thermalization time is simply inversely proportional to the coupling strength .",
    "for an out of resonance  engineered reservoir with @xmath46 , @xmath47 is notably increased and therefore the thermalization process is slowed down .",

    "the diffusion coefficient is indeed the time derivative of the heating function .",
    "we remind that , since @xmath50 for the case considered here , whenever @xmath51 the master equation ( [ merwa ] ) is of lindblad type , whilst the case @xmath52 corresponds to a non - lindblad type master equation . from eq .",
    "( [ hfhightappr ] ) one sees immediately that while for @xmath53 the heating function grows monotonically , when @xmath13 assumes negative values it can decrease and present oscillations .    to better understand such a behavior we study in more details the dynamics for three exemplary values of the ratio @xmath54 between the reservoir cut - off frequency and the system oscillator frequency : @xmath45 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "as we have already noticed the first case corresponds to the assumption commonly done when dealing with natural reservoir while the last case corresponds to an engineered out of resonance   reservoir .",
    "for @xmath57 the diffusion coefficient , given by eq .",
    "( [ deltaht ] ) , is positive for all @xmath24 and @xmath54 since @xmath58 therefore the master equation is always of lindblad type and the heating function grows monotonically from its initial null value .",
    "equation ( [ hfhightappr ] ) shows that , for times @xmath59 and for @xmath45 , @xmath60 , that is the initial non - markovian behavior of the heating function is quadratic in time .    for @xmath55 , a similar behavior is observed since also in this case @xmath13 is positive at all times .",
    "finally , in the case @xmath46 , eq .  ( [ deltaht ] ) shows that , if @xmath54 is sufficiently small , @xmath61 oscillates acquiring also negative values .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the long time asymptotic value of @xmath13 is always positive .",
    "whenever the diffusion coefficient is negative , the heating function decreases , so the overall heating process is characterized by oscillations of the heating function . the decrease in the population of the ground state of the system oscillator , after an initial increase due to the interaction with the high @xmath0 reservoir , is due to the emission and subsequent reabsorption of the same quantum of energy .",
    "such an event is possible since the reservoir correlation time @xmath62 is now much longer than the period of oscillation @xmath63 .",
    "we underline that , although the master equation in this case is not of lindblad type , it conserves the positivity of the reduced density matrix .",
    "this of course does not contradict the lindblad theorem since the semigroup property is clearly violated for the reduced system dynamics @xcite .",
    "this section gives a brief review of the experimental procedures for engineering artificial reservoirs and for measuring the heating function of the trapped ion .",
    "starting from the careful analysis of the recent experiments presented in this section , we will describe , in the sec .  [ expqbm ] , our experimental proposal for simulating qbm with single trapped ions .",
    "let us begin discussing the technique used to engineer an artificial reservoir coupled to a single trapped ion .",

    "several types of engineered reservoirs are demonstrated , e.g. , thermal amplitude reservoirs , phase reservoirs , and zero temperature reservoirs .",
    "a high @xmath0 amplitude reservoir is obtained by applying a random electric field @xmath64 whose spectrum is centered on the axial frequency @xmath65mhz of oscillation of the ion @xcite .",
    "the trapped ion motion couples to this field due to the net charge @xmath66 of the ion : @xmath67 , with @xmath68 displacement of the c.m . of the ion from its equilibrium position . remembering that @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 annihilation and creation operators of the fluctuating field modes , and that @xmath72 one realizes that this coupling is equivalent to the bilinear one assumed to derive eq .",
    "( [ qbmme ] ) .",
    "the random electric field is applied to the endcap electrodes through a network of properly arranged low pass filters limiting the natural  environmental noise but allowing deliberately large applied fields to be effective .",
    "this type of drive simulates an infinite - bandwidth amplitude reservoir @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that , for the times of duration of the experiment , namely @xmath73s , the heating due to the natural reservoir is definitively negligible @xcite .",
    "the reservoir considered in our paper is a thermal reservoir with spectral distribution given by @xmath74 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac { \\omega}{\\pi } \\frac{\\omega_c^2}{\\omega_c^2+\\omega^2 } \\coth{(\\omega / k t ) } , \\label{eq : i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where eq .",

    "therefore , for high @xmath0 , the reservoir discussed in the paper can be realized experimentally by filtering the random field , used in the experiments for simulating an infinite - bandwidth reservoir , with a lorentzian shaped low pass filter at frequency @xmath77 .",
    "the change of the ratio @xmath54 thus would be accomplished simply by changing the low pass filter .      in this subsection",
    "we focus on two experimental methods for measuring the heating function of a single trapped ion .",
    "the first method is based on the asymmetry in the sideband motional spectrum of the ion and it has been used in @xcite for measuring the process of thermalization of an ion , initially cooled down to its ground vibrational state , due to the interaction with the natural reservoir .",
    "the same method is used in @xcite for measuring the cooling dynamics of an ion subjected to sideband cooling lasers .",
    "the second technique allows to measure the populations of the vibrational density matrix of the ion , from which the heating function can be obtained .",
    "this last method has been used in @xcite in the case of interaction with an artificial amplitude reservoir .    for both techniques",
    "the first step is the preparation of the initial vibrational and electronic ground state , @xmath78 , obtained by laser cooling and optical pumping to the state @xmath79 .",
    "the mean vibrational number is then measured after fixed delay time intervals . during the delay artificial noise , which simulates the amplitude reservoir , may be applied . in this way",
    ", the time evolution of @xmath80 is obtained .",
    "let us begin with the first technique .",
    "at each fixed delay time , the ion is in its electronic ground state @xmath81 and in a certain vibrational state . a laser pulse , tuned to a vibrational sideband , is then used to transfer the population to the upper electronic level @xmath82 . after this , by means of an electron shelving technique , the electronic state of the ion is detected in order to check wether a transition to @xmath83 has occurred or not . repeating this procedure one gets the electronic excited state occupation probability @xmath84 .",
    "the amplitude of the blue and red vibrational sidebands is defined as the probability of making a transition @xmath85 due to a laser pulse tuned to the blue or red sideband , respectively , and therefore is given by @xmath84 .",
    "this quantity depends on the mean occupation number @xmath86 . for @xmath87",
    ", only the blue sideband can be exited while the red one is absent . in general",
    "the asymmetry in the amplitude of the @xmath88th red @xmath89 and blue @xmath90 vibrational sidebands , allows to extract @xmath91 @xcite : @xmath92    a limitation of this method is given by off - resonant excitation via the carrier transition .",
    "if the driving field is tuned to the first lower vibrational sideband , in the resolved sideband condition @xmath93 , with @xmath94 rabi frequency of the laser pulse , processes involving off - resonant transitions go as @xmath95 . in order to have a sensible measurement of the heating function , the population due to off - resonant transitions have to be much smaller than the scale over which @xmath15 varies .",
    "we now focus on the second experimental method for measuring the heating function .",
    "this method actually allows to measure the diagonal elements @xmath96 of the vibrational density matrix and it has been used to observe their decay due to the interaction with an artificial amplitude reservoir , as the one described in previous subsection . for this type of reservoir and in the experimental conditions of @xcite , the time evolution of @xmath97 is well approximated by the law @xmath98 where the phenomenological parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the mean reservoir quantum number and the heating rate , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ pnnist ] ) is valid under the assumptions of high @xmath0 reservoir and for times much smaller than the thermalization time , @xmath101 .",
    "such conditions turn out to be verified in the experiments described in @xcite . in this experimental situation ,",
    "the markovian behaviour of the heating function , before thermalization takes place , is simply given by @xmath102 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath57 , corresponding to an infinite bandwidth markovian reservoir , eq .",
    "( [ hfhightappr ] ) becomes @xmath103 . comparing this expression of the heating function with the one of the experiments one can identify @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    "practically , increasing the fluctuations of the random electric field applied at the trap electrodes is equivalent to an increase in the heating function @xmath115 . since @xmath116 , as given by eq .",

    "we are ready to describe our experimental proposal for observing the non - markovian dynamics of the heating function and , in general , for simulating the dynamics of a quantum brownian particle .",
    "it is well known that non - markovian features usually occur in the dynamics for times @xmath131 . in general , since @xmath132 and typically @xmath133hz for trapped ions , this means that deviations from the markovian dynamics appear for times @xmath134s .",

    "a way to force non - markovian features to appear is to detune  the trap frequency from the reservoir spectral density .",

    "this can be done either increasing the intensity or increasing the fluctuations of the applied noise , or combining an increase in the intensity with an increase in the fluctuations .",
    "moreover one needs to use a low pass filter for the applied noise , as described in subsection [ engres ] , having cut off frequency @xmath151 .",
    "we now examine briefly the conditions for which the quadratic behaviour of the heating function , could be observed .",
    "we remind that this is the case in which @xmath45 and the time evolution of the density matrix is of lindblad - type . in view of the considerations done at the beginning of this section , in order to reveal non - markovian dynamics in a time scale of @xmath152s we need to have @xmath153s , that is , for @xmath154 , @xmath155mhz .",
    "this means that one actually needs a loose  trap .",
    "for example , for @xmath156khz , with the same applied noise used in @xcite ) , i.e.  @xmath157hz , the time evolution of the heating function is the one shown in fig  [ qbmexpquad ] .",
    "time evolution of the heating function for @xmath144hz , @xmath145mhz , and @xmath154 .",
    "solid line is the analytical and circles the simulation result.,width=8,height=7 ]    if one wants to perform a fast measurement of @xmath86 , e.g.  using the first method and assuming @xmath158hz , the small value of the trap frequency makes it difficult not only to implement one of the two methods for measuring the heating function , but also to reach the initial ground state since the sidebands are not clearly resolved , and therefore resolved sideband cooling technique can not be applied .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that contrarily to the case of a natural reservoir , which is always in action , in the case of an engineered reservoir one can switch off the applied noise after a certain delay time and , assuming that the effect of the natural reservoir is negligible , measure the heating function without the severe requirement of big values of @xmath94 . if one assumes that after an amplitude noise pulse the state of the ion does not change , then it is not necessary to perform a fast measurement of @xmath86 . therefore one can work with smaller values of @xmath94 , such that @xmath159 .",
    "concluding , while measuring the quadratic behaviour of the heating function ( @xmath57 ) could be a more challenging task from the experimental point of view , revealing the oscillatory non - markovian behaviour ( @xmath56 ) appears to us in the grasp of the experimentalists , in the conditions we have analyzed in this section .",
    "in this paper we have studied the dynamics of a single harmonic oscillator coupled to a quantum reservoir at generic temperature @xmath0 . in our analysis we have used both the analytic solution for the reduced density matrix and the nmwf method .    we have paid special attention to the non - markovian heating dynamics typical of short times . in this regime the system time evolution is influenced by correlations between the system and the reservoir . for certain values of the system and reservoir parameters , virtual exchanges of energy between the system and its environment become dominant .",
    "these virtual processes strongly affect the short time dynamics and are responsible for the appearance of oscillations in the heating function ( non - lindblad type dynamics ) .    extending the ideas of using trapped ions for simulating quantum optical systems , we have proposed to simulate qbm with single trapped ions coupled to artificial reservoirs .",
    "we have carefully analyzed the possibility of revealing , by using present technologies , the non - markovian dynamics of a single trapped ion interacting with an engineered reservoir and we have underlined the conditions under which non - markovian features become observable .",
