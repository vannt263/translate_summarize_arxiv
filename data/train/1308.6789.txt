    "despite a long history of searches for lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) in charged leptons no such signal beyond the standard model ( sm ) has ever been observed , with the most impressive limit @xmath2 reported recently by the meg collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the existence of neutrino oscillations suggests that , at some level , lfv should also take place in such processes . with only the light neutrinos of the sm present ,",
    "lfv is strongly suppressed by @xmath3 , due to the glashow-iliopoulos-maiani ( gim ) mechanism .",
    "this results in lfv process rates far below any experimental sensitivity which can be safely ignored . on the other hand , many beyond the standard model scenarios predict new sources for charged lepton flavour violation associated , for example , with the exchange of neutral heavy leptons or supersymmetric states .",
    "since these lfv processes can proceed even in the limit of strictly massless neutrinos , their rates are unconstrained by the smallness of neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "however in many such scenarios the non - observation of @xmath0 in the meg experiment places stringent limits on expected lfv rates at high energies . as a consequence , the observation of lfv at high energy colliders such as the lhc is precluded due to either the mediating particles being too heavy or their couplings to the charged leptons too small .",
    "there are a few phenomenological solutions to this problem .",
    "for example , the suppression with respect to the mass difference of the lfv mediating particles differs depending on whether they are virtual or produced as real resonances . in the latter case , the suppression is only @xmath4 instead of a gim - like @xmath5 .",
    "this was demonstrated in the case of mediating heavy neutrinos and a right - handed @xmath6 boson in left - right symmetrical models in @xcite .",
    "we here discuss an alternative scenario where right - handed neutrinos are pair - produced via a @xmath1 portal and can only decay via the flavour - dependent yukawa coupling to the light neutrinos @xcite .",
    "consequently , the process rate is unsuppressed by the small flavour couplings and hence can be observable despite unobservably small @xmath0 rates .",
    "such a scenario can be realized in models with an extra u(1 ) or extended gauge sector such as left - right symmetric models @xcite .",
    "within the standard type - i seesaw scenario with the mass matrix @xmath7 for the left- and right - handed neutrino , the mixing between the heavy @xmath8 and light @xmath9 states is completely fixed once the masses are specified , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "eq .   is expressed in terms of one generation ; for detailed multi - generation seesaw expansion formulas for the mixing coefficients see ref .",
    "@xcite . for the observed light neutrino mass scale @xmath11  ev and a tev scale heavy neutrino ,",
    "the mixing is negligibly small , @xmath12 and , despite the breakdown of the gim mechanism @xcite , the heavy neutrinos do not enhance low energy lfv process rates sufficiently for detectability .",
    "this can dramatically change in extended seesaw scenarios with tev scale heavy neutrinos .",
    "for example the inverse seesaw mechanism @xcite is described by the mass matrix @xmath13 including a sequential singlet state @xmath14 as third entry . with the additional freedom introduced by the small lepton number violating @xmath15 parameter ,",
    "light neutrinos can be accommodated for any value of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in essence , the magnitude of neutrino mass becomes decoupled from the strength of lepton flavour violation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the light - heavy mixing can also be enhanced within the standard minimal seesaw sector by choosing specific flavour textures in the mass matrix of the type - i seesaw , see for example @xcite .    for definiteness",
    "here we focus on lfv in the electron - muon sector induced by the mixing between isodoublet and isosinglet neutrinos , via the corresponding yukawa couplings . as a result , the heavy neutrinos couple to charged leptons via their small isodoublet components @xmath17 , which we treat as free parameters .",
    "it is convenient to write these couplings in terms of an overall mixing strength , @xmath18 and the ratio of mixing strengths , @xmath19 .",
    "these parameters are unrestricted by the smallness of neutrino masses ; however they are constrained by weak universality precision measurements to be @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we do not take into account possible constraints on @xmath21 from neutrinoless double beta decay searches .",
    "although highly stringent for a heavy majorana neutrino , they are avoided in the presence of cancellations , such as in the quasi - dirac neutrino case .",
    "various physics scenarios beyond the standard model predict different types of tev - scale @xmath1 gauge bosons associated with an extra u(1 ) that could arise , say , from unified so(10 ) or e(6 ) extensions .",
    "an introduction and extensive list of references can be found in ref .",
    "electroweak precision measurements restrict the mass and couplings of a @xmath1 boson .",
    "for example , lepton universality at the @xmath22 peak places lower limits on the @xmath1 boson mass of the order @xmath23  tev @xcite depending on hypercharge assignments . from the same data , the mixing angle between @xmath1 and the sm @xmath22",
    "is constrained to be @xmath24 . for a discussion of direct limits on @xmath1 masses",
    "see @xcite .",
    "recent limits from searches at the lhc will be discussed in more detail below .    in the following we work in a simplified u(1)@xmath25 scenario with only a @xmath1 and @xmath8 present beyond the sm . for the mechanism described here to work ,",
    "it is crucial that there are no other particles present through which the heavy neutrino can decay unsuppressed . for definiteness",
    "we assume two reference model cases : the so(10 ) derived u(1)@xmath25 coupling strength with the charge assignments of the model described in @xcite , and a leptophobic variant where the u(1)@xmath25 charges of sm leptons are set to zero .",
    "in the scenario considered here , the lfv branching ratio for the process @xmath0 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath26 where the loop function @xmath27 is of order one with the limits @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "this prediction should be compared with the current experimental limit @xcite , @xmath32 from the meg experiment which aims at a final sensitivity of @xmath33 .",
    "the expression therefore results in a current upper limit on the mixing parameter @xmath34 for @xmath35  tev .",
    "in contrast , the mixing strength @xmath36 expected in the standard high - scale type - i seesaw mechanism eq .   would lead to an unobservable lfv rate with @xmath37 .    if the photonic dipole operator responsible for @xmath0 and also contributing to @xmath38 and @xmath39 conversion in nuclei is dominant , searches for the latter two processes do not provide competitive bounds on the lfv scenario at the moment .",
    "depending on the breaking of the additional u(1)@xmath25 symmetry , non - decoupling effects may appear which can boost the effective @xmath40 vertex contributing to @xmath38 and @xmath39 conversion in nuclei @xcite .",
    "portal at the lhc.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    the process under consideration is depicted in figure  [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "as shown , we will focus on the channel where the heavy neutrinos decay into sm @xmath6 bosons which in turn decay hadronically .",
    "the cross section of the production part @xmath41 can be approximated by @xcite @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the factor @xmath45 describing higher order qcd corrections .",
    "the target lhc beam energy is @xmath46  tev .",
    "here we focus on lfv at the lhc but not on lepton number violation .",
    "the latter is usually considered as a smoking gun signal of heavy majorana neutrinos but realistic models with tev scale neutrinos such as inverse @xcite and linear seesaw @xcite scenarios usually lead to a quasi - dirac nature for the heavy neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "it is strictly required in case of large light - heavy mixing @xmath21 in order to ensure adequately small neutrino masses @xmath47  ev  @xcite .",
    "we therefore perform our calculations assuming a dirac heavy neutrino producing only opposite sign leptons .",
    "if it were a genuine majorana neutrino , inclusion of the same sign lepton signature would improve the discovery potential by taking advantage of the low background expected for same sign lepton signatures . from this point of view",
    "the results obtained here are conservative .     produced in @xmath48 with @xmath49  tev as a function of its mass @xmath50 and the light - heavy mixing @xmath21 ( solid blue contours ) .",
    "the dashed red contours denote constant values for @xmath51 whereas the grey shaded band corresponds to parameter values which produce light neutrino mass scales @xmath52 between @xmath53 and 0.3  ev within the canonical type - i seesaw mechanism.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    the total cross section of the lfv signal process @xmath54 is then given by @xmath55 the neutrino @xmath8 can decay via the channels @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , all of which are suppressed by the small mixing parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 . in the presence of multiple heavy neutrinos with small mass differences we neglect the decays involving either real or virtual @xmath1 , @xmath61 .",
    "the branching ratio of the above channels into a given lepton flavour is independent of the overall mixing strength @xmath21 .",
    "as long as the total decay width @xmath62 is large enough so that the heavy neutrino decays within the detector , the lhc lfv process rate is unsuppressed by the overall mixing strength @xmath21 .",
    "the decay length of the heavy neutrino ( in the rest frame of a 3  tev @xmath1 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : decaylength ] as a function of @xmath50 and the light - heavy mixing @xmath21 , in comparison with @xmath51 . for @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "tev , the neutrino decays promptly with a decay length @xmath65  mm , and the lhc lfv process considered here is independent of and completely unsuppressed by @xmath21 .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath1 boost in the detector frame does not significantly alter this conclusion , but in general leads to a slight broadening of the yellow region . for lengths between 1  mm - 10  m",
    ", the @xmath8 decay may still be observable with potentially spectacular signatures such as displaced vertices or in - detector decays .",
    "figure  [ fig : decaylength ] also indicates the parameter area corresponding to the observed neutrino mass scale @xmath52 in the standard type - i seesaw mechanism , clearly showing that this regime can not be probed by low energy searches but potentially by the lhc process considered here .",
    "the total cross section only depends on the ratio @xmath66 of the flavour couplings , @xmath67 , and is maximal for @xmath68 .",
    "this is very much in contrast to @xmath51 in eq .   which is heavily suppressed by a small value of @xmath21 , though is independent of the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "at the lhc with 14  tev as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath50 for maximal lfv ( dotted contours ) .",
    "the solid and long dashed contours give the required luminosity at the lhc for a @xmath70 discovery , in the case of so(10 ) and leptophobic charges , respectively .",
    "the vertical lines denote the upper limit on @xmath69 from existing lhc searches in dijet and dilepton channels.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in order to examine the viability of observing the signal at the 14  tev run of the lhc we perform a simulation of @xmath71 using pythia  8 @xcite with both @xmath6 bosons decaying into quarks producing a @xmath72 final state .",
    "possible sm backgrounds arise from the channels @xmath73 which we simulate using madgraph  5 @xcite .",
    "we include parton showering and hadronization for both signal and background using pythia  8 .",
    "we apply the following selection criteria : ( i ) an event must have four jets with a transverse momentum of at least 40  gev each and ( ii ) two opposite - sign leptons with transverse momenta @xmath74  gev ; ( iii ) since there is no source of missing transverse energy ( met ) in the signal , we require @xmath75  gev and ( iv ) a large dilepton invariant mass @xmath76  gev further reduces the @xmath77 background and reduces the @xmath78 and @xmath79 to negligible amounts .",
    "in addition , the heavy neutrino mass could be determined through a peak in the invariant mass @xmath80 , although the sharpness of such a peak is likely to be reduced due to the combinatorics of identifying the correct final particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : mzp_mn ] shows the cross section of the process @xmath81 at the lhc with 14  tev as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath50 for maximal lfv , @xmath82 . in addition , it provides an estimate of the required luminosity at the lhc to observe a @xmath70 lfv signal over background significance , as derived using the simulation procedure described above .",
    "in addition to the case with so(10 ) derived u(1)@xmath25 charges , it also shows the expected significance for a leptophobic @xmath1 with the lepton doublet and charged lepton singlet charges put to zero .",
    "this increases the signal cross section by about 25% due to the increased @xmath1 decay branching ratio into heavy neutrinos .",
    "we find that lfv can potentially be discovered for heavy neutrinos and @xmath1 with masses @xmath83  tev and @xmath84  tev , respectively . in the case of three degenerate neutrinos with identical @xmath68",
    ", this reach would increase to @xmath85  tev and @xmath86  tev .    in determining the lhc potential to discover lfv through the process considered here",
    ", we must take into account existing @xmath1 lhc searches .",
    "the vertical lines in figure  [ fig : mzp_mn ] indicate the upper limits on @xmath69 from the lhc 8  tev run in the dijet channel @xmath87 @xcite ( assuming sm charges and couplings ) and the dilepton channel @xmath88 , @xmath89 @xcite ( assuming so(10 ) derived couplings and charges ) .",
    "the corresponding limit from dilepton searches reported by cms @xcite is slightly stronger with @xmath90  tev but difficult to consistently apply in our case as it is quoted only in terms of the cross section ratio to the sm @xmath22 production .",
    "the parameter space of the scenario with so(10 ) derived charges is strongly constrained by dilepton searches . on the other hand ,",
    "the leptophobic scenario , only limited by the dijet searches , still allows a large parameter space where a strong lfv signature could be observed .",
    "( @xmath91 ) at the lhc with 14  tev and @xmath92 as a function of @xmath66 .",

    "strongly non - universal couplings , i.e. with the neutrino coupling dominantly to either @xmath97 or @xmath15 , result in the largest overall significance as the flavour content of the background is @xmath98 . in contrast , the unambiguous discovery of lfv requires approximately universal couplings , @xmath99 .",
    "the seesaw mechanism and its low - scale variants provide a well motivated scenario for neutrino mass generation in many new physics models .",
    "the experimental non - observation of low energy lepton flavour violating processes puts stringent constraints on the scale and the flavour structure of such models .",
    "this usually means that the discovery of related lfv processes or heavy resonances at the lhc is already ruled out .",
    "here we discussed a scenario with negligible lepton flavour violating rates in low energy rare process , while testable at the high energies accessible at the lhc .",
    "the scenario described here illustrates a general mechanism , namely , ( i ) a lfv messenger particle is produced through a portal via an unsuppressed coupling but ( ii ) can only decay via small lepton flavour violating couplings .",
    "such a scenario would provide an alternative solution to the general flavour problem in beyond - the - standard model physics which is testable at high energy colliders , despite tiny lfv couplings and consequently unobservably small low energy lfv rates .",
