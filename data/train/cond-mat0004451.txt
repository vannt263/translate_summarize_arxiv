    "* t*he question with regard to the existence of non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) metallic states in spatial dimensions @xmath0 greater than one , specifically in @xmath3 , has been subject of intensive investigations in the course of the past several years , following the observation that the normal - state properties of doped cuprate superconducting compounds markedly differ from those of conventional metals which are accurately described within the framework of the fermi - liquid ( fl ) theory ( anderson 1988,1989,1990a , b,1997 , varma , littlewood , schmitt - rink , abrahams and ruckenstein 1989 , 1990 , littlewood and varma 1991 ) . since according to a celebrated theorem due to luttinger ( 1961 ) , validity of the many - body perturbation theory to all orders would imply that metallic states of fermions in spatial dimensions greater than one would be fls , strictly speaking , this theorem has direct bearing on cases where fermions interact through a _ short - range _ two - body potential . ]",
    "failure of the fl picture in the case of the doped cuprates has been considered to signal breakdown of the many - body perturbation theory as applied to these materials .",
    "indeed , in the course of the recent years the question with regard to breakdown of the many - body perturbation theory has been a central aspect in debates concerning the above - mentioned failure of the fl phenomenology in describing the normal - state properties of the doped cuprate compounds ( anderson 1990b , 1993 , engelbrecht and randeria 1990 , stamp 1993 ) ( see also engelbrecht and randeria ( 1991 ) , anderson ( 1991 ) ) .",
    "consequently , in this period a number of non - perturbative methods have been put forward and applied to models of interacting fermions with the aim of determining whether or not nfl states are viable in @xmath1 . elsewhere",
    "( farid 1999a , b ) we have presented accounts of these developments and therefore refrain from repetition here . for our present considerations it is relevant to mention that the existence of nfl metallic states in realistic _",
    "microscopic _ models of interacting fermions in @xmath1 has remained elusive to this date .    in view of the above - indicated apparent discrepancy that prevails between theoretical predictions and experimental observations , we have undertaken to subject a number of aspects that are crucial to establishing feasibility or otherwise of nfl metallic states in @xmath1 to an independent investigation .",
    "the present work is the third report of our investigations on this subject .",
    "our first work ( farid 1999a ) concerned a critical analysis of the above - indicated luttinger ( 1961 ) theorem .",
    "we have demonstrated ( farid 1999a ) that",
    "luttinger s ( 1961 ) proof of this theorem involves an implicit assumption which is _ strictly _ specific to fl metallic states , implying that the luttinger ( 1961 ) theorem far from excluding the possibility of the existence of nfl metallic states in @xmath1 ( for cases where the many - body perturbation theory is valid to _ all _ orders ) , in fact amounts to a _ statement of consistency _ of the fl states with the principles of the theory of interacting fermions as expressed in terms of the many - body perturbation theory .",
    "our second work ( farid 1999b ) concerned an in - depth analysis of the non - perturbative bosonisation scheme due to haldane ( 1992 ) for metallic states in @xmath4 as applied to a model of interacting fermions in @xmath3 , originally put forward by houghton and marston ( 1993 ) and subsequently extensively studied by houghton , kwon and marston ( 1994 ) , houghton , kwon , marston and shankar ( 1994 ) and kwon , houghton and marston ( 1995 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated failure of the haldane ( 1992 ) bosonisation scheme in @xmath1 and established that this scheme invariably predicts the metallic state of the model under consideration to be an _ unconventional _",
    "fl , irrespective of the nature ( _ and _ strength , provided it be non - vanishing ) of the fermion - fermion interaction function , that is whether this be short - range , long - range coulomb or super - long range .",
    "the latter result is in particular at variance with an earlier finding by bares and wen ( 1993 ) , it is also at variance with the findings by houghton , kwon , marston and shankar ( 1994 ) and kwon , houghton and marston ( 1995 ) . we have however shown ( farid 1999b ) that this discrepancy is due to use of certain invalid approximations by the latter authors . ]",
    "indicating the metallic state of the system for super - long - range interactions to be a nfl .",
    "we have traced back the shortcoming of the haldane ( 1992 ) bosonisation scheme in @xmath1 to the neglect of some terms in the commutation relation concerning some current operators ; in particular , in the case of metallic systems with a sufficiently small ( or vanishing ) value for the jump @xmath5 in the momentum distribution function at the fermi momentum , the neglected terms are more relevant than the sole term that is taken into account , namely the _ quantum anomaly_. for completeness , we mention that by solely taking into account the _ quantum anomaly _ , the mentioned current operators form a kac - moody algebra ( see , e.g. , goddard and olive 1986 ) .",
    "] we have also shown that under _ all _ conditions the fermi energy of the interacting system within the haldane ( 1992 ) bosonisation scheme coincides with that of the non - interacting system .",
    "this unambiguously implies that _ even _ for weakly - interacting metallic states , for which @xmath5 is close to unity , neglect of the indicated terms in the mentioned commutation relation for current operators is _ not _ justified .    the exactly solvable one - dimensional luttinger model ( luttinger 1963 , mattis and lieb 1965 ) has been dealt with by three distinct methods .",
    "one is based on the technique of bosonisation , of which the haldane ( 1992 ) scheme is a generalisation to higher dimensions .",
    "the bosonisation method for calculation of correlation functions is due to luther ( 1979 ) which derives from works by luther and peschel ( 1974 ) , mattis and lieb ( 1965 ) , tomonaga ( 1950 ) and bloch ( 1933 , 1934 ) .",
    "parallel developments involving similar views as in the indicated works are due to jordan ( 1935 , 1936a , b ) , krnig ( 1935a , b , c ) , skyrme ( 1958 , 1959 , 1961a , b ) and coleman ( 1975 ) . for reviews",
    "see stone ( 1994 ) and kopietz ( 1997 ) . ] the second , due to everts and schulz ( 1974 ) , is based on the solution of the equation of motion for the green function which derives from an exact decoupling of the hierarchy of the green functions . the third approach , due to dzyaloshinski and larkin ( dl ) ( 1974 ) , for a detailed exposition of this approach see ( bohr 1981 ) . ]",
    "exploits the conservation laws and the associated ward identities .",
    "this scheme has been generalised to @xmath1 and reported in a series of articles by di castro and metzner ( 1991 ) , metzner and di castro ( 1993 ) , castellani , di castro and metzner ( 1994 ) , castellani and di castro ( 1994 ) and extensively reviewed by metzner , castellani and di castro ( mcdc ) ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is this scheme that we subject to a critical analysis in the present work . in our considerations that follow ,",
    "we shall almost exclusively refer to the last review article without thereby implying that the cited subject matters would have their origin in this work .    contrary to case of @xmath2 , associated with _ linear _",
    "energy dispersions for the non - interacting left- and right - movers ( that is the case of the one - dimensional luttinger ( 1963 ) model ) , in cases of @xmath1 the generalised dl approach is _ not _ exact ; mcdc ( 1998 ) assert , however , that for fermi systems the generalised approach is _ asymptotically _ exact in the limit of strong forward scattering , that is in the limit of zero momentum transfer @xmath6 for fermions in a narrow band of width @xmath7 ( @xmath8 in the authors notation ) encompassing the fermi surface . _ in this work we demonstrate this not to be the case . _",
    "we further support this finding by referring to the similarity between the expressions for the single - particle green function within the framework of the generalised dl ( mcdc 1998 ) scheme and the haldane ( 1992 ) bosonisation approach and the fact that , as we have indicated above , the latter is _ not _ adequate for @xmath1 ( farid 1999b ) .",
    "we also establish that the rigorous formalism for systems of interacting fermions , even in the limit of strong forward scattering , is _ not _ amenable to treatment by the wilson - fisher ( 1972 ) ( wilson 1973 ) technique of dimensional continuation .",
    "the organisation of this work is as follows . in ",
    "ii we present an outline of the generalised dl formalism ( mcdc 1998 ) which will facilitate our discussions in this paper . anticipating the results that we present in ",
    "iii , here we indicate that the conventional process of dimensional continuation is _ not _ applicable to a general formalism concerning systems of _ interacting _ fermions , not even in the limit where solely forward scattering processes are taken into account . in ",
    "iii we analyse two crucial steps that are involved in the derivation of the generalised dl formalism and explicitly demonstrate their inadequacies in @xmath1 ; in ",
    "iii.a we deal with a relationship between the charge and the current part of a vertex function that has been held to be asymptotically correct in the limit of strong forward - scattering and show that its validity in @xmath1 is _ strictly _ limited to the trivial case of non - interacting fermions ; in ",
    "iii.b we show the invalidity of a second relationship between two irreducible vertex functions , also held to be asymptotically correct in @xmath1 in the limit of strong forward - scattering . in ",
    "iv we explicitly demonstrate how the singular behaviour of the momentum distribution function , in particular that pertaining to the ground - state of the system , at the fermi momentum , renders the mathematical manipulations that are central to the derivation of the generalised dl method in @xmath1 ( mcdc 1998 ) inapplicable .",
    "here we further show how similar manipulations , combined with a complete disregard of the errors associated with these , in @xmath2 ( specifically in dealing with the one - dimensional luttinger model ) give rise to results which coincide with the exact results , thus misleadingly suggesting their general applicability even in @xmath1 .",
    "we finally present a summary and concluding remarks of this work in ",
    "v. we devote an appendix which follows the main text to a brief exposition of the wilson - fisher ( wilson and fisher 1972 , wilson 1973 ) technique of dimensional continuation , which concerns continuation of the number of the spatial dimensions from integer to real , as well as complex , values . from the details in this appendix",
    "it becomes apparent how application of this technique is hampered in the context of the many - body theory of interacting fermions .",
    "here we propose an alternative scheme of dimensional continuation which , although not unique , is not restrictive with regard to the functional dependence of the integrands on the variable of integration .",

    "the same procedure fails however , in the case of unconventional fls or nfls .",
    "in this work we have presented a brief outline of the steps that underlie a generalised method which has been modelled on a formalism due to dl ( 1974 ) which exactly solves the _ one - dimensional _ luttinger ( 1963 ) model .",
    "key elements in both the original dl ( 1974 ) method and its generalisation ( mcdc 1998 ) are the conservation laws and the associated ward identities . these identities give rise to some auxiliary relationships which are _ exact _ in the one - dimensional luttinger model , rendering this model exactly solvable , whereas though _ not _ exact , these auxiliary relationships have been asserted to be _ asymptotically exact _ for fermi systems in @xmath1 in the limit where the scattering of the electrons in a thin layer circumscribing the fermi surface is strictly in the forward - scattering channel ( corresponding to scattering processes with vanishingly - small momentum transfers , that is @xmath274 ) .",
    "we have presented an analysis concerning a crucial relationship between the irreducible density and current vertex parts , @xmath219 and @xmath222 respectively , which is exactly valid in the case of the one - dimensional luttinger model and asserted ( mcdc 1998 ) to be _ asymptotically exact _ in the forward - scattering limit when @xmath1 .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated failure of this relationship for the conventional fl systems in @xmath3 .",
    "we have further demonstrated that this relationship is exact , in any arbitrary spatial dimension , _ only _ in the trivial case of systems of strictly non - interacting fermions .",
    "recall that metallic states of non - interacting fermions are _ ideal _ fls .",
    "] from the same analysis it follows that for nfls in @xmath1 there does _ not _ exist even the remotest ground on the basis of which the presumed asymptotic validity of the mentioned relationship can be justified : here , the interlocking of energies and momenta in the arguments of the corresponding self - energies , which by the very fact of being by definition non - differentiable in neighbourhoods of the fermi energy and/or the fermi momentum ( otherwise the associated metallic states would not be nfls ) , stands in the way of obtaining a relationship similar in appearance to the indicated supposed asymptotic relationship between the irreducible vertex parts .",
    "we have further explicitly demonstrated that the continuity equation _ only _ in @xmath2 gives rise to a direct relationship between the vertex parts @xmath61 and @xmath314 , @xmath397 , independent of the analytic properties of the momentum distribution function @xmath398 . in @xmath1 ,",
    "continuity as well as continuous differentiability of this function in the above - indicated narrow band of the momentum space circumscribing the fermi surface _ must _ be assumed before a similar direct relationship between the two vertex parts , as in @xmath2 , can be deduced .",
    "as is well known , @xmath398 is discontinuous at @xmath101 both for fls and certain class of nfls ( for the latter see farid 1999a ) . for the case of the one - dimensional luttinger model , though continuous , @xmath399 is _ not _ differentiable at @xmath400 .",
    "therefore , by assuming a similar behaviour for @xmath401 in @xmath1 as in @xmath2 , we have established that the indicated simplified relationships between @xmath61 and @xmath314 , @xmath397 , do _ not _ hold in @xmath1 .",
    "each of the above - mentioned two findings removes ground for validity in @xmath1 of the heretofore supposed asymptotic ward identities in the forward - scattering limit .",
    "this failure concerns both fls ( excluding strictly non - interacting metallic systems ) and nfls .    in an earlier work ( farid 1999b )",
    "we have demonstrated failure of the haldane ( 1992 ) bosonisation scheme in @xmath1 both on general grounds and on grounds of an explicit calculation on a model of interacting fermions in @xmath3 . within the framework of the haldane bosonisation scheme , the explicit expression for",
    "the single - particle green function @xmath402 takes a simple form in the space - time representation .",
    "it is interesting that through replacing a screening function that features in this expression by its random - phase approximation ( that is rpa ) counterpart , one obtains an expression which coincides with that obtained within the generalised dl framework ; compare eq .",

    "( 24 ) in ( kwon , houghton and marston 1995 ) . the use of the rpa within the framework of the generalised dl method is considered to be justified through reliance upon the so - called generalised clt ( kopietz , hermisson and schnhammer 1996 ) which implies that while the rpa yields the _ exact _ response function in the case of the one - dimensional luttinger model ( dl 1974 ) ( see eq .",
    "( [ e56 ] ) above ) , it yields an _ asymptotically exact _ response function in @xmath1 in the forward - scattering limit .",
    "in ( farid 1999b ) we have commented on the generalised clt , however independent of the true status of this theorem in @xmath1 , and whether one has to do with fl or nfl systems , from the point of view of our considerations in the present work the coincidence of the two green functions is of crucial importance as it indirectly establishes that indeed the generalised dl ( mcdc 1998 ) formalism is of _ no _ validity for systems of interacting fermions in @xmath1 .",
    "to summarise the main conclusions arrived at in this and our earlier works ( farid 1999a , b ) , we can state that _",
    "none _ of the presumed non - perturbative methods designed thus far for investigating the existence or otherwise of nfl metallic states in @xmath1 has proved capable of dealing with systems of interacting fermion in @xmath1 , not even in the weakly - interacting limit .",
    "renewed attempts concerning design and application of non - perturbative methods are therefore called for in order to settle the long - standing problem with regard to the existence or otherwise of nfl metallic states in spatial dimensions greater than one .",
    "it is therefore befitting to close this work by mentioning that laughlin s ( 1998 ) recent statement , that `` ... and all attempts to account for the existence of a luttinger - liquid at zero temperature in spatial dimension greater than one have failed .
