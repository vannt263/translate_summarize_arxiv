    "srtio@xmath0 has two possible ( 001 ) surface terminations , either a sro or tio@xmath3 layer , which determine the stacking sequence of the deposited films , and thus control the electronic properties of the heterostructures @xcite . to further explore unique functionalities at these surfaces and interfaces , an understanding of the electronic states of these two surface terminations at atomic resolution",
    "is highly desirable . in the tio@xmath3-terminated surface ,",
    "numerous surface reconstructions that are dependent on the surface preparation conditions have been reported in single crystals @xcite and thin films @xcite , whereas the sro - terminated surface has remained relatively unexplored @xcite .",
    "it is widely known that srtio@xmath0 prepared in highly reduced conditions exhibits a metallic behavior due to electron doping from oxygen vacancies @xcite .",
    "considering the very high dielectric constant of srtio@xmath0 @xcite , a strong coupling between electrons and ions can be expected and is likely to play a crucial role in transport properties , as observed in various systems @xcite .",
    "the transport properties of srtio@xmath0 have been understood in terms of large polarons , according to optical measurements @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent optical and angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) studies found a moderate electron - phonon coupling and no clear signature of small polarons in srtio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "arpes is a surface - sensitive technique that can distinguish whether the electronic structure originates in a bulk state or surface state .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction discussed by meevasana _",
    "_ was attributed mainly to the bulk electronic structure rather than the surface state @xcite .",
    "electron - lattice interactions near the surface could have a significant impact on the electronic properties at the srtio@xmath0-based interface , however , an understanding of such surface - related effects has remained elusive .    in this paper , we have investigated the local electronic structure of the sro - terminated srtio@xmath0(001 ) surface using low - temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm and sts ) .",
    "a stripe - like unidirectional ordering is identified at low energies in the empty states , which can be attributed to ordering of the ti@xmath4 ions . in the tunneling spectra ,",
    "large energy gaps with no density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath5 ) are observed .",
    "these results suggest the importance of the electron - lattice interaction associated with the unidirectional lattice distortion induced by charge ordering in the sro - terminated srtio@xmath0 surface .",
    "nb - doped ( 0.1 at.% ) srtio@xmath0(001 ) single crystals and 10 unit cell ( u.c . ) thick srtio@xmath0(001 ) thin films were examined .",
    "the single crystal surfaces were prepared by buffered hf etching @xcite and subsequent annealing at 800@xmath6c for 6 h in ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) , followed by 1000@xmath6c annealing for 3 min in uhv conditions .",
    "the srtio@xmath0(001 ) thin films were homoepitaxially grown on nb - doped ( 0.1 at.% ) srtio@xmath0(001 ) substrates at 1100@xmath6c in an oxygen pressure of @xmath7 torr by pulsed laser deposition .",
    "details regarding the film growth were reported previously @xcite . in both samples , sro layers with almost identical features",
    "were observed in stm images , in contrast to the tio@xmath3-terminated surfaces , which exhibited completely different atomic arrangements depending on the surface preparation condition @xcite .",
    "the samples were transferred to an uhv stm system ( unisoku usm-1300s ) without exposure of the surface to air , and all stm measurements were performed at 78 k.",

    "additionally , small terrace structures of intermediate height relative to the surrounding tio@xmath3-terminated surfaces were identified [ fig .",
    "considering the crystal structure and the height difference , it is reasonable to suppose that the small terrace is related to the sro plane .",
    "in fact , this is consistent with previous friction force microscopy and coaxial - impact - collision ion - scattering spectroscopy ( caiciss ) measurements , which identified two different surface terminations and that the minority fraction of the surface was a sro layer with a half unit cell step height @xcite .",

    "the intensity started to increase and was most enhanced at @xmath20 v. however , at @xmath19 v , the intensity was almost negligible , which indicates the absence of unidirectional ordering .",

    ", width=317 ]    the electronic states responsible for the tunneling originate mostly from the orbital states of subsurface ti atoms , even in the sro - terminated surface because the weakly hybridized sr@xmath25 ions contribute a small amount of spectral weight to the dos at the bias voltages investigated in this study @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the tunneling current at low bias voltages probes mainly the electronic states of the subsurface tio@xmath3 layer , whereas the electronic states of the sro layer ( mostly o ) predominate at high bias voltages .",
    "given these results , the unidirectional structure is likely to be induced in the tio@xmath3 subsurface layer , rather than in the sro layer .",
    "one plausible explanation for the observed unidirectional modulation is a charge density wave ( cdw ) , which has been encountered in a wide variety of layered materials , and is basically driven by fermi surface nesting .",
    "a recent arpes measurement revealed that the bulk - related fermi surface topography of electron - doped srtio@xmath0 consists of three ellipsoid - like surfaces along each of the three axes , while a cylinder - like fermi surface along @xmath26 has been observed for the surface states @xcite .",
    "this result excludes the possibility of the unidirectional fermi surface nesting required for a stripe - like ordering .",

    "the different spectroscopic feature ( the peak or the shoulder structure ) is possibly due to the different site of the oxygen vacancy and might be associated with different charge densities , as observed in the tio@xmath3-terminated surfaces as well @xcite .",

    "polaronic quasiparticle excitations through inelastic tunneling processes were reported in manganite systems , with energy gaps evident in the tunneling spectra even in the metallic phase @xcite .    based on these results ,",
    "we conclude that the stripe ordering found in this study is exclusively induced near the sro - terminated surface , accompanied by a strong electron - lattice interaction . with this scenario ,",
