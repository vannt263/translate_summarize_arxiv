    "the first experiments of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern have shown that creation of black holes is much less than predicted by theorists . when the discovery of new physics at lhc associated with supersymmetry at low energies",
    "fails , the models of tev - scale gravity become of particular interest .",
    "the lhc can be used to test models with large extra dimensions ( leds ) and set bounds on their parameters @xcite .",
    "initially proposed as an alternative to supersymmetry in solving the hierarchy problem , such models are motivated by string theory and open new interesting directions in cosmology . inspired by earlier ideas of the universe as a topological defect in higher - dimensional space - time and the tev - scale supersymmetry breaking in heterotic string theory associated with compactification @xcite , they appeared in several proposals .",
    "a conceptually and technically simple one is the arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) scenario @xcite , with the standard model particles living in the four - dimensional space - time and gravity propagating in the @xmath15-dimensional bulk with the @xmath16 flat dimensions compactified on a torus .",
    "gravity is strong with a corresponding planck mass @xmath17 at the ( presumably ) tev scale .",
    "other led scenaria include the warped compactification randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite , which are based on an identification of the physical four - dimensional space - time with a 3-brane embedded into a five - dimensional bulk endowed with the cosmological constant , in which case the fifth dimension may be infinite . the model known as `` universal extra dimensions '' @xcite ( ued ) allows _ all _ fields to propagate through the bulk .",
    "the common feature of all these models is the existence of a large ( in planck units ) length @xmath18 , which may appear either via a compactification radius , or via inverse powers of curvature of the infinite bulk .",
    "if the quantum gravity scale happens to be of order of tev , the lhc , expected to reach center of mass energies one order of magnitude higher , will be able to study information about gravity at ultraplanckian energies @xcite .",
    "the gravitational radius associated with the center of mass collision energy increases with energy , and in the transplanckian regime becomes larger than the planck length , indicating that gravity behaves _ classically _ at least for some region of momentum transfers @xcite .",
    "thus the transplanckian gravity is believed to be adequately described by the classical einstein equations @xcite .",
    "this , presumably , allows one to make reliable theoretical predictions of gravitational effects without entering into the complications related to quantum gravity .",
    "black hole production is arguably the most exciting inelastic process in the context of the tev - gravity .",
    "apart from the creation of black holes , another inelastic gravitational process is radiation .",
    "bremsstrahlung itself represents the natural process to test the existence of extra dimensions and probe them .",
    "colliding ultrarelativistic particles will radiate and the number of dimensions can easily be determined by the dependence of the radiated energy from the lorentz factor of collision .",
    "bremsstrahlung is characterized by the only one length parameter of experiment  the impact parameter @xmath2 . to keep gravity classical",
    ", it is expected to be much greater than the schwarzschild radius @xmath19 , associated with the energy @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for the mandelstam @xmath21-variable : @xmath22    however , the calculation of classical ultraplanckian _ gravitational _ bremsstrahlung in the context of the add model @xcite predicts strong enhancement of radiation losses as compared to theories without extra dimensions already for large values of the impact parameter .",
    "these extreme losses possibly originate from the large number of light kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes @xcite .",
    "our estimate shows that transplanckian collisions should be heavily damped by radiation , and classical radiation reaction has to be taken into account in the study of gravitational collapse and bh production in colliders .    on the other hand , the theory of electromagnetic radiation ( both classical and quantum ) has been developed to much greater extent than gravitational radiation",
    "the same applies to the corresponding _ detectors of the emitted waves_. thus it is natural to include vector bremsstrahlung among the realistic inelastic problems , where the force causing the acceleration may be either gravitational or non - gravitational .",
    "nevertheless the problem of radiation reaction is far from solved , even in electrodynamics .",
    "inspired by the pioneering work of dirac @xcite , it was developed by rohrlich and teitelboim in flat space - time @xcite , adapted by dewitt and brehme for curved background @xcite and generalized to curved background in higher dimensions in @xcite .",
    "some attempts to include radiation reaction in qed have been made during the last thirty years @xcite .",
    "however , the number of physical cases where these attempts have succeeded in producing a closed form result , is quite modest @xcite .",
    "thus electromagnetic bremsstrahlung in an external gravitational field ( generated by the partner particle ) represents a process of particular theoretical interest in the context of another application of tail appearance coming from the non - local part of the green s function in curved background .",
    "it actualizes the purposes of this paper .",
    "furthermore , the synchrotron radiation shows that within some region of parameters , the electromagnetic field can be also treated classically , accurately matching the result of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "thereby , in addition , to make the scheme self - consistent , one has to demand also the classicality of the particles trajectory and _ classicality _ of the electrodynamics .",
    "perturbation theory over the gravitational constant @xmath23 will be of usage in the computation presented here .",
    "given as a zeroth - order solution , minkowski space - time will be used as an effective background for the wave propagation .",
    "the significance of such a choice is highlighted by the following facts : ( i ) it ensures the asymptotically flat space - time , ( ii ) one considers tensors and their variations as tensors in flat space with simple raise / lowering indices and ( iii ) it allows the freedom to use fourier - transforms .",
    "thus one considers the minkowski space - time as the background , while the direct nature of modes ( kaluza - klein modes for toroidal extra dimensions or curvature - mediated modes in cosmological models with no compactification , like rs2 ) should be taken into account as a correction due to the curvature .",
    "depending on the choice of model , the vector field can either propagate through the bulk , or not , even though the charges are confined on the 3-brane .",
    "thus we generically consider minkowski space - time as the background with _ arbitrary _",
    "dimensionality @xmath24 , while all interesting cases can be obtained as limiting cases of the generic calculation .",
    "this work continues a series of papers @xcite : pure gravitational transplanckian bremsstrahlung is considered in @xcite , the classical scalar bremsstrahlung in @xcite , while @xcite is devoted to the scalar emission in the gravity - mediated bremsstrahlung .",
    "mathematically , in the add model the minkowski limit appears as the reduction of summation over kk - modes into the integration , as long as the restriction on the large size of extra dimensions holds .",
    "therefore , one has to assume @xmath25 to have large number of kk - quanta , for each model to be applied to .    most of the previous works on classical bremsstrahlung were concerned with gravitational radiation : for reviews see @xcite and references therein , and @xcite among the most recent .    among the previous works in four dimensions on the electromagnetic radiation caused by gravitational force",
    ", one emphasizes the papers by peters @xcite , by matzner and nutku @xcite and the work by galtsov , grats and matyukhin @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the post - linear formalism is used in the coordinate space for schwarzschild background , considering bremsstrahlung near the vicinity of black hole .",
    "some qualitative arguments and estimates are given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the equivalent - photons method was adapted for gravitons .",
    "this approach was criticized in @xcite , who found that this method is of limited range when the frequency range is decreased @xmath26 times , and thereby inappropriate .    in @xcite the iteration scheme accompanied by the perturbation theory",
    "is used  as well as in the present work , while mathematical techniques are different : contour integration in @xcite versus expansion of macdonald functions here .",
    "the similar features are : ( i )",
    "the damping of radiation amplitude at high frequencies @xmath27 ( at lab frame ) , ( ii ) the significant frequency @xmath28 , coming from the partial cancelation of local and non - local currents , and ( iii ) the final power of lorentz factor : @xmath29 the difference is related with the erroneous neglect of the local current ( which turns out to be significant ) at the dominant frequency @xmath30 in @xcite , whereas it has the same magnitude as the non - local part which is retained . because of this , the total coefficient is determined with an error , as well as the small- and medium - frequency behavior .",
    "thus our answer in four dimensions corrects the overall coefficient obtained in @xcite , and generalizes it to the higher dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we show that in higher dimensions the higher - frequency regime @xmath31 dominates over the domain @xmath32 , due to the volume factors in the momentum space .    taking into account some similar features appearing in these works @xcite , we minimize the derivations and refer to the previously derived ones , when it is possible",
    ". meanwhile we would like to emphasize the features not observed in previous works : conservation of source ( validity of the gauge condition ) , influence of self - action , the bremsstrahlung of two charges , the length of the emitted wave formation ( coherence length ) , etc .    in order to distinguish vector radiation by gravitational scattering from pure electromagnetic bremsstrahlung ( which is expected to represent much larger effect due to the values of couplings in 4d ) , we charge only one particle _ in the most _ of the paper , while a subsection in the discussion section is devoted to the radiation effects coming from the scattering of two charges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model , approximation method and formulae necessary for subsequent computation of the emitted energy , including the polarization vectors , are described in the section [ setup ] .",
    "the local and non - local amplitudes , their combination and the amplitude damping at high frequencies ( the destructive interference effect ) are derived in section [ radiation_amplitudes ] .",
    "section [ emitted_energy ] is devoted to the computation of total emitted energy .",
    "some additional aspects ( zero - frequency limits ) are discussed .",
    "particular attention is paid to the emission in the add model .",
    "possible cut - offs , the comparison of electromagnetic bremsstrahlung by gravitational and non - gravitational forces , the conclusions and prospects are presented in the discussion section .",
    "finally , some necessary formulae for computation and the simple proof of the destructive interference phenomenon in the vector case , dealing with just the integration - by - parts technique , are given in three appendices .",
    "we compute here a classical spin - one bremsstrahlung in ultra - relativistic gravity - mediated scattering of two massive point particles @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the space - time is assumed to be @xmath35 with coordinates @xmath36 , @xmath37 , with the mostly minus signature @xmath38 .",
    "the units we use are @xmath39 .",
    "particles are localized on the observable 3-brane and interact via the gravitational field @xmath40 , which propagates in the whole space - time @xmath35 .",
    "we also assume the existence of a massless bulk vector field @xmath41 , which interacts with @xmath33 , but not with @xmath34 .",
    "thus only @xmath33 has an electromagnetic charge @xmath42 .",
    "the action of the model is symbolically of the form @xmath43and explicitly , in an obvious correspondence , in the reparametrization - invariant form @xmath44- \\int \\left[m \\sqrt { g_{mn } \\dot{z}^m \\dot{z}^n }    - e a_m \\dot{z}^m \\,\\right ] d\\tau -\\int m^\\prime\\sqrt { g_{mn } \\dot{z}'^m \\dot{z}'^n }   \\ , d\\tau'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for the @xmath15-dimensional newton s constant .",
    "@xmath47 is the field strength defined as usual : @xmath48 .",
    "our convention for the riemann tensor is @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "finally , the ricci tensor and curvature scalar are defined as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .    in the sequel we deal with the affine parameter of the both particles worldline , so @xmath53 .",
    "thus we consider only that class of the worldline reparametrizations , which maintains the natural ( affine ) parametrization of the trajectory .",
    "variation of ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath54 and @xmath55 gives the particles equations of motion in the covariant form @xmath56 where the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath57    variation over @xmath41 leads to @xmath58 finally , varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath40 , one obtains the einstein equations @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a total matter of the system - at - hand .    in order to resolve the equations of motion we use perturbation theory with respect to the gravitational coupling and the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "as was argued in the introduction , one expands the metric as a perturbation on the minkowski background : @xmath61 and then finds the solution of equations of motion in each order iteratively . respectively , all tensors are to be considered as tensors in flat space - time , as well as raising / lowering of their indices .",
    "we intend to use an approximation technique that relies on the fact that the deviation from the minkowski metric is small i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , we have to evaluate @xmath63 at the location of the charge , i.e. considering @xmath34 as the source of an external gravitational field . in",
    "what follows : @xmath64 the possible restrictions due to the charge do not affect the perturbative approximation we use and their discussion is postponed to the discussion section .",
    "as mentioned above we will be solving the equations of motion iteratively .",
    "therefore all fields and kinematical quantities are to be expanded as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 can be @xmath67 , @xmath60 , @xmath68 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 as well as their derivatives .",
    "thus the left superscript is used to denote the order of iteration .    next , to perform the iterations , it is more useful to work with a flat - derivative interpretation of the eom ( [ emden0 ] ) : @xmath69 and to rewrite it , introducing ",
    "current @xmath70 : @xmath71 finally , one has to explicitly manifest the matter sources of the generic equations to vary them in the sequel : the mechanical energy - momentum tensor of two particles and the stress - tensor of the bulk vector field are given by corresponding action variation over the total metric @xmath40 and read ( in the gauge @xmath72 ) @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",

    "furthermore we will be working in the lorentz frame where the uncharged particle @xmath34 is at rest ( at zeroth order ) : in addition , we set the origin of coordinate system to coincide with its zeroth - order location .",
    "@xmath81 the charged particle @xmath33 is ultra - relativistic and moves along the 3-brane with high - speed @xmath82 and large lorentz factor @xmath83 .",
    "we choose the spatial direction of zeroth - order motion as the @xmath84axis , while the vector of closest proximity @xmath85 between the two particles is chosen to coincide with the @xmath86axis .",
    "finally we choose the time of scattering to be zero . in",
    "what follows @xmath87 thus @xmath88 represents the lorentz factor of collision , @xmath89 represents the impact parameter of this scattering , while both @xmath90 and @xmath91 lie on the brane and are mutually orthogonal .",

    "a note to be added : in fact , we use the perturbation theory only over the gravitational coupling @xmath23 .",
    "this is achieved by the fact that only the gravitational force acts on the particles up to the first order .",
    "because of this fact , both terms in ( [ rholoc ] ) are proportional to @xmath124 and @xmath54 , respectively , and thus contain @xmath23 as a pre - factor .      here",
    "we highlight the basic steps to derive the momentum radiated in the form of an electromagnetic field . a flat space world tube @xmath125 with a boundary of two space - like hypersurfaces , @xmath126 defined at @xmath127 , as well as a time - like cylindrical surface @xmath128 located at infinite distance",

    "the analogy of such a resurrection was proposed by @xcite for the opposite ultimate case of non - relativistic motion along a bounded orbit , where originally - tail contribution ( with respect to the total metric ) reappeared as non - conservative non - relativistic larmor energy .      here",
    "we assume that @xmath723 and the emitted energy is determined by those values obtained in the section [ emitted_energy ] .",
    "thereby the total initial energy is essentially the energy of the fast particle : @xmath724 our goal here is to set bounds on the minimal value of an impact parameter @xmath2 and to confirm the validity of the classical approach applied above .",
    "the condition on the weakness of gravitational field , @xmath725 , has been discussed in ( [ restr_0 ] ) . the condition @xmath726 ( [ restr_b ] )",
    "is related with the treatment of space - time as higher - dimensional . additionally , in the add model , it is directly related to the pass from kk - mode - summation to the quasi - continuous integration .",
    "finally , the condition on the classicality of the emitted vector field obviously reads @xmath727    next consider the conditions which do not follow from the classical theory but are necessary for the classical result to fit the quantum one .",
    "the simple quantum - mechanical restrictions @xmath728 reflect the fact that the particle can not lose energy more than it had initially ( being free at infinity ) .",
    "the ultimate situations of hard bremsstrahlung , when the charge emits almost all its energy , are admissible in qed @xcite .",
    "next , for the treatment of the emitted photons as classical , we need a large number of their quanta , which implies the weak particle - recoil . for the radiation problem at hand , the weak particle - recoil condition due to the emission of photons with frequency @xmath404 is satisfied if the momenta of the emitted photons are much smaller than the momentum transfer of the elastic collision . for the hard - photon emission with @xmath729",
    "the latter condition is satisfied if the emission angle @xmath329 is less than the deflection angle @xmath730 , while for @xmath731 this condition can be relaxed .    substituting the characteristic emission angle @xmath732 into ( [ grav_angle ] ) one obtains @xmath733 this condition differs from the one , ( [ restr_a ] ) , given in the introduction for gravitational bremsstrahlung . it is stronger than the weak - field condition ( [ restr_0 ] ) but weaker than ( [ restr_a ] ) .    indeed , according to the iteration scheme",
    ", the ultrarelativistic charge emits the energy after its trajectory is gravitationally perturbed , so we do not need to accounting for the back - reaction of the gravitational field due to the fast charge , on the uncharged , target , particle .",
    "moreover , the experience from analogous computations of the total energy of synchrotron radiation shows that this condition can be relaxed and replaced , instead , by the weaker @xmath734 without restriction on the angles of the emitted photon .",
    "when the emitted energy @xmath735 is of order @xmath736 , this condition also guarantees a large number of emitted quanta , and justifies further the description of radiation with a classical field .",
    "estimating the efficiency of the emitted energy in four dimensions according to ( [ e4d ] ) , one gets @xmath737 by virtue of restrictions ( [ restr_1],[restr_3 ] ) .",
    "for the add bremsstrahlung ( [ rhonexp5 ] ) , with the same characteristic frequency @xmath28 , the efficiency reads @xmath738 if one also takes into account ( [ restr_b ] ) .    in higher dimensions with characteristic frequency @xmath251 the direct application in ( [ e_final_1 ] ) .",
    "] of the above estimates gives @xmath739 .",
    "thereby this might lead to the efficiency catastrophe for @xmath740 .",
    "the possible resolutions of this paradox may be related with :    * a small pre - factor , of order of @xmath741 , in ( [ e_final ] ) ; * frequency @xmath742 is incompatible with the requirement @xmath743 .",
    "thereby one needs a cut - off on the frequency ; * the possible vainshtein limit of the process in a space with compactified radii ; * combination of ( [ restr_1 ] ) with ( [ restr_3 ] ) gives @xmath744    let us consider the latter possibility in practice .",
    "for instance , for the scattering of protons on neutrons with @xmath745 , available at the lhc , the classical radius of a proton and @xmath746 for neutron are given ( @xmath343 ) by @xmath747 respectively , while in higher dimensions the ratio @xmath748 is even larger .",
    "thus the restriction on @xmath2 is determined , essentially , by @xmath749 .",
    "moreover , the latter is less than the actual size of a proton @xmath750 and its compton wavelength @xmath751 of it : @xmath752 the scattering of nuclei present similar features .    on the other hand ,",
    "the radiated energy efficiency coming from ( [ e_final ] ) can be presented as @xmath753 and , by virtue of @xmath754 , easily becomes smaller than unity .",
    "this practically resolves the efficiency paradox .",
    "the same argument makes the dominance of gravitational radiation over the electromagnetic , almost impossible , an issue raised above according to the naive comparison of the power of @xmath26 .    for the scattering of electrons one",
    "takes the compton length .",
    "thereby there is no the efficiency catastrophe in the problem - at - hand , but one sets the following bound on the value of the impact parameter : @xmath755    in ued , from ( [ e_final_ued ] ) one obtains : @xmath756    taking into account @xmath757 ( [ impact_2 ] ) , one rewrites ( [ eff_ued ] ) as @xmath758 if directly compare @xmath759 by values ( [ impact_2 ] ) and ( [ rad_class ] ) .",
    "now return to the large - modes condition ( [ nemit_ued3 ] ) : substituting @xmath760 by ( [ impact_2 ] ) and comparing with ( [ impact_1 ] ) one concludes that for @xmath761 the condition @xmath762 is well satisfied and a large number of the emission modes are excited , that gives the enhancement of the bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "going back to the spectrum we see that if @xmath763 holds , then @xmath764 thus the maximal value of the frequency lies inside the domain @xmath765 , so the part of destructive interference region , the main point of our computation , can be detected in practice in all kinds of the extra dimensions and corresponding gravity models .    despite the radiation efficiency being tiny",
    ", one can expect that absolute amounts of the emitted radiation , due to the relatively large @xmath749 with respect to @xmath766 , can be determined ( for instance , for heavy nuclei ) and can give information on the ( possible ) size and number of extra dimensions .",
    "a detailed study of classical electromagnetic ( vector ) radiation emitted in ultra - relativistic collisions of massive point - like particles was presented .",
    "the space - time was assumed to have an arbitrary number of toroidal or non - compact extra dimensions and the post - linear approximation scheme of general relativity was employed for the computation .",
    "the angular and frequency distributions of radiation , as well as the total emitted energy were studied in detail up to leading ultra - relativistic order .",
    "three characteristic frequency regimes ( @xmath767 , @xmath622 and @xmath768 ) of the emitted radiation were identified and the characteristics of the dominant contribution was determined in various dimensions , depending on the gravity model",
    ".    in particular , in any number of dimensions the soft component of radiation is mainly due to the scattered particles , with negligible contribution coming from the cubic graviton - graviton - photon interaction term . in all cases of bremsstrahlung",
    "most of the emitted waves are beamed ( in the lab frame ) inside a narrow cone with angle @xmath243 and along the spatial direction of fast - particle s motion .    among the notable features we would like to mention ,",
    "are the following :    * the radiation amplitude is damped by the factor @xmath769 at the frequency region @xmath770 : @xmath381 thus at @xmath27 the amplitude @xmath771 is suppressed by @xmath772 with respect to @xmath773 , that represents the destructive interference ( di ) effect ; * the frequency distribution goes like @xmath774 inside this frequency regime .",
    "hence for @xmath343 and in the add - case most of the radiation has characteristic frequency @xmath431 , for @xmath775 the dominant frequency is @xmath776 while in the transition case @xmath9 the entire domain @xmath777 contributes equally to add a logarithm of @xmath26 into the total emitted energy ; * zfl gives qualitatively adequate result for the add bremsstrahlung ( where di happens beyond @xmath778 ) and for pure electromagnetic bremsstrahlung ( where no di happens and the amplitude has the same behavior up to @xmath779 ) in the small - angle region ; * no efficiency catastrophe for reasonable values of the lorentz factor and charges ; * the applicability of perturbation theory is essentially determined by the compton length of a charge : @xmath780 * the coherence length argument gives an adequate explanation of the frequency - angular characteristics of the radiation amplitude but does not predict which frequencies will dominate in spectrum .",
    "however , in contrast to the four - dimensional case , in any number of extra dimensions @xmath491 the frequency spectrum of the emitted radiation vanishes as @xmath356 and the total emitted energy in soft gravitons is negligible .",
    "also , contrary to what happens with soft radiation emission , the cubic graviton - graviton - photon interaction and the scattered particles themselves are equally important as sources of radiation with high frequency .",
    "in fact it was shown that in any dimension they lead to partial cancelation ( _ destructive interference _ ) of the total beamed radiation amplitude in the high frequency domain , as a result of which the emitted energy in the @xmath781frequency regime is reduced by two powers of the lorentz factor @xmath26 in the lab frame .    the relevance of the classical analysis to the full _ quantum radiation _ problem was also discussed .",
    "the _ classicality conditions _ , necessary for the classical treatment to be a good approximation to the full quantum problem were derived and the radiation efficiency @xmath782 , i.e. the fraction of the initial energy which is emitted in gravitational radiation , was computed for values of the parameters within the region of validity of our classical computation .",
    "thus one concludes that the gravitational scattering of charges and corresponding bremsstrahlung , at least classically , is a more reliable scheme to detect extra dimensions already in contemporary colliders , though , of course the quantum - field treatment of this process ( at least for the vector field ) is necessary and represents the direct prospect of further study .    finally , the spectral characteristics are qualitatively discussed in the context of coordinate - space equation of a charge in dimensions of the even space - time dimensionality ( lorentz  dirac and dewitt  brehme  hobbs types of equations ) .",
    "the pure vector bremsstrahlung is qualitatively described by the radiative part of the higher - dimensional lorentz ",
    "dirac equation in flat space . for the vector bremsstrahlung under the gravity - mediated collision",
    "it was found that the observable competition of frequencies originates from the different terms of the dewitt ",
    "hobbs equation , describing the motion of a charge in the fixed external curved background .",
    "thus one concludes that as qualitative argument , the concept of coherence length is valid and directly corresponds to the similar behavior of amplitudes at ultrarelativistic characteristic frequency regimes @xmath783 and @xmath742 .",
    "nevertheless , as a quantitative argument , coherence length is much less useful when the total physical process is split into some sub - processes .",
    "coherence length consideration does not predict which frequency will dominate in the spectrum , since it does not take into consideration inside itself the possible competition between the spectral - angular characteristics of a source and volume factor in the integration measure when the flux is computed .",
    "however , the implementation of this interpretation and the proper treatment of this classical computation have to be confirmed by the corresponding quantum approach .",
    "meanwhile , even low- and medium - frequency parts of the spectral distribution , which are definitely in agreement with the quantum case , contain some distinctive features for the possible presence of extra dimensions to be detected .",
