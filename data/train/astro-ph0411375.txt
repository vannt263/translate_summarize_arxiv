    "uv and optical observations of galaxies are in general affected by dust extinction .",
    "empirical determinations of the star formation rate in individual galaxies , modeling of the radial properties and color gradients of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or estimations of the `` cosmic star formation rate history '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all need to take into account its effects .",
    "while detailed radiative transfer calculations self - consistently accounting for the whole sed can be used to estimate this effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is usually done by applying much simpler standard recipes .",
    "these recipes include the following : ( a ) the balmer decrement method .",
    "this involves a comparison of the observed / ratio with its predicted value ( 2.86 for case b recombination , e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "although usually used for attenuation , its results can be extrapolated to other wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "( b ) the uv spectral slope method .",
    "* hereafter m99 ) proposed a relation between the uv extinction and the uv spectral slope ( the continuum spectrum @xmath0 between 1300 and 2600  having a shape of @xmath1 ) in starbursts . recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k04 ) computed the equivalent relationship in the galex bands . finally , ( c ) the tir / uv luminosity ratio method ( see m99 ) .",
    "radiative transfer models have shown that this ratio is a robust indicator of the uv extinction as it does not depend much on either the geometry or the star formation history @xcite .",
    "each of the above methods has its own limitations .",
    "the balmer decrement method is affected by systematics caused by uncertainties in the underlying absorption of the stellar populations , and the fact that it concerns only very massive stars and may not represent the extinction affecting older stars .",
    "the uv spectral slope method was calibrated for starburst galaxies and may not apply more generally .",
    "moreover , both methods rely on colors determined at similar wavelength , which are quite sensitive to dust radiative transfer effects ( witt , thronson & capuano 1992 , witt & gordon 2000 -hereafter wg2000 ) . finally , the tir / uv method is the most reliable , but until the advent of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and now the spitzer space telescope , this method was limited in its application by the low spatial resolution of the iras data .",
    "m83 is an interesting laboratory to test the recipes for extinction given the profusion of data available in addition to the galex images and for being almost face - on .",
    "models of its stellar content and chemical evolution can be constrained by these data and used to predict the intrinsic properties of the stellar population .",
    "an alternative study combining observations from galex and iso of m101 is presented in popescu et al@xmath2 ( this issue ) .",
    "galex observed m83 for a total of 1352s on june 07 2003 simultaneously through its fuv and nuv bands ( see fig@xmath2 1 ) . from these images",
    "we derive the fuv and nuv profiles by azimuthally averaging along ellipses , after masking the stars , and subtracting the sky .",
    "the ellipticity and position angle ( 0.1 and 80@xmath3 ) were taken from kuchinski et al@xmath2(2000 ) . in this paper , the authors presented ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) observations of m83 .",
    "the galaxy was observed by uit only in the fuv domain , with a slightly better resolution ( @xmath43arcsec ) than the galex one ( @xmath45arcsec ) .",
    "the surface - brightness sensitivity limit of the galex image is however @xmath42mag deeper .",
    "our fuv profile is in good agreement with the one published in kuchinski et al@xmath2(2000 ) but extend to larger radii .",
    "the map and radial profile of the uv spectral slope @xmath5 ( computed in the galex bands as in k04 ) are shown in fig@xmath2 [ figmaps]c & [ figradial]a , respectively .",
    "we estimate 0.15mag to be the uncertainty in the calibration of the galex ab surface brightnesses .",
    "we derive the and profiles from narrow - band imaging ( fwhm@xmath660 ) in the lines , and adjacent continuum images , all obtained at the las campanas observatory ( chile ) 40-inch telescope using the 2048@xmath73150 pixels ccd camera .",
    "the main uncertainty in the and especially surface brightness comes from the underlying balmer absorption that has to be accounted for . in order to estimate this effect",
    ", we use a drift - scanning long - slit spectrum of m83 obtained with wfccd using the blue grism and slit width of 2arcsec at the 100-inch du pont telescope also at las campanas .",
    "both h@xmath8 absorption and emission were detected along the central @xmath94arcmin of m83 .",
    "the average underlying absorption at is 4.2  ( with a rms of 1  along the slit ) . since the absorption in",
    "could not be measured , we assumed it to be the same as for ( e.g. mccall et al@xmath2 1985 ) .",
    "the adopted value is close to the absorption obtained with the stellar population model described in next section ( 4 and 5.5  on average at and respectively ) .",
    "we also use the spectroscopic results to estimate the [ nii]@xmath106548,6584  contamination and correct accordingly using [ nii]/=0.45 .",
    "profiles were computed from the 60 and 100 @xmath11 m images obtained by a iras - hires request @xcite .",
    "the 60 @xmath11 m image was convolved with a gaussian to obtain a resolution similar to the 100 @xmath11 m image ( @xmath4 90 arcsec ) .",
    "the two profiles were then combined to compute the tir surface brightness profile , following @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the fuv images was degraded in a similar way before computing the tir / fuv ratios profiles .",
    "we use models for the chemical and spectro - photometric evolution of m83 based on @xcite ( bp2000 ) , with an updated star formation law ( depending on the angular velocity ) determined in @xcite . to compute the sfr",
    ", we adopt the rotation curve of @xcite .",
    "these models , however , can not reproduce the observed gaseous profile ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the models do not include radial inflows .",
    "there are reasons why such a flow might be present in m83 : the strong bar could induce radial motion and the central starburst needs to be supplied with fresh gas .",
    "interaction with ngc  5253 may be responsible for these peculiarities @xcite .",
    "we introduce in the models of bp2000 radial inflows of various efficiencies and various starting times .",
    "the best models are chosen as the ones reproducing the observed dust - free profiles : total gas , and near - infrared surface brightness of 2mass .",
    "several models including a flow beginning a few gyrs ago ( 1 to 5 ) produce satisfactory results . in fig@xmath2 [ fig1]a",
    ", we show the profile of the average intrinsic spectral uv slope ( , short - dashed curve ) , and the range of values ( shaded area ) obtained with these best - models.2.1 used for the intrinsic slope of a starburst @xcite .",
    "more details on the models will be given in a forthcoming paper ]",
    "we now consider the `` classical '' extinction estimators used in extra - galactic studies : ( a ) the extinction obtained from the / ratio ( after correction for the balmer underlying absorption ) can be extrapolated to the fuv wavelength .",
    "we obtain = 1.4 by assuming that the color excess of the stellar continuum is 0.44 times the gaseous emission one ( see buat et al@xmath2 2002 and references within ) , and a galactic extinction curve ( for which /@xmath12=2.26 ) .",
    "( b ) it is common to apply the method of m99 in galaxies with nuclear starbursts like m83 . we compute a profile following this assumption ( -starburst , fig@xmath2 [ fig1]b ) , adopting the tir / fuv-@xmath5 relation computed by k04 .",
    "( c ) finally , we compute the extinction from the tir / fuv ratio following buat et al@xmath2 ( this issue ) . the result is presented in fig@xmath2 [ fig1]b .",
    "the absence of features in this gradient is due to the low resolution infra - red iras observations . to achieve a better spatial resolution taking advantage of the tir / fuv calibration for",
    ", we perform a fit ( outside the 50 central arcsec of the bulge ) providing = 0.86 + 0.91 ( @xmath13 ) ( dotted lines in fig@xmath2 [ figwg ] , shifted to account for the average value of @xmath14 ) .",
    "we use this result to compute a new extinction profile ( -models in fig.2 , middle panel ) from the profile .",
    "the extinction maps ( fig@xmath2 1 ) and the profiles ( fig@xmath2 2 ) show that the extinction is relatively low in the very center ( see the hole at the center of the -map , fig@xmath2 [ figmaps]c ) , assuming the low values of in this region indicate low extinction .",
    "the extinction ( indicated by the various tracers ) becomes rapidly high in a circumnuclear region and progressively decreases as we move into the disk of the galaxy the various indicators show some common structure : the spectral slope ( and the extinction profiles derived from it ) , as well as the balmer decrement , show several correlated peaks .",
    "one of the most remarkable is located 100 arcsec from the center .",
    "inspection of the images ( fig@xmath2 1 ) show that this radius corresponds to the position of spiral arms where both the star formation rate and the extinction are enhanced with respect to average regions of the galaxy .",
    "the -starburst extinction gives larger values compared to other indicators , i.e@xmath2 m83 shows lower extinctions ( computed from the tir / fuv ratio ) than starburst galaxies for the same value of @xmath8 .",
    "this is in agreement with the deviations with respect to the starburst case already obtained in the lmc ( bell et al@xmath2 2002 ) or in less active galaxies ( k04 ) .",
    "we used earlier a purely empirical relation between and ( - ) in m83 .",
    "because of the many uncertainties ( geometry , ... ) , we prefer this to theoretical prescription . in fig@xmath2 3a",
    ", we compare our data outside the bulge with two models of wg2000 ( adopting for the value of our best model ) to illustrate the dependence on the geometry .",
    "we also compare our results with the model of k04 for the birthrate parameter b obtained in our model of m83 ( log b@xmath6 0.2 ) .",
    "we find that it overpredicts a(fuv ) by a large amount for any given value of . finally , our data are compared to other samples : the fit of k04 for the starbursts of m99 ( solid line ) , and the integrated nuv and tir selected galaxies of buat et al@xmath2 ( this issue ) .",
    "the profile of m83 is consistent with the latter , althought with slightly larger @xmath5 . fig@xmath2",
    "[ fig2]b shows the /(@xmath13 ) ratio ( where is still determined from tir / fuv ratio ) as a function of radius ( the dotted curve indicates the same profile if the extinction derived from ( @xmath15 ) as discussed previously is used instead of the tir / fuv ratio ) . outside the bulge , /(@xmath13 )",
    "has an average value of 1.9 ( this value would become 1.2 if the usual = @xmath152.1 was adopted ) .",
    "the fuv surface brightness profile can be transformed into a star formation rate profile using the standard conversion factor of @xcite : sfr ( ) = 1.4 @xmath7 10@xmath16 l@xmath17 ( erg s@xmath18 hz@xmath18 ) .",
    "regardless of the uncertainties affecting this number ( see kennicutt 1998 ) , the fuv profile must be corrected for extinction to obtain a reliable sfr . fig@xmath2",
    "[ fig1]c shows the sfr profile obtained without extinction correction ( lower dotted line ) , and with various corrections proposed in the previous section years . ] .",
    "we find that the sfr profile of our best model ( stars in fig@xmath2 2c ) is in good agreement with the one deduced from the observations with the tir / fuv correction .",
    "this suggests that the star formation law used in our evolutionary models is quite realistic .",
    "the integrated star formation rate also depends on the extinction correction . owing to multi - wavelength resolved data",
    ", we can compute the sfr of m83 inside 300 arcsec according to various assumptions . with no extinction correction ,",
    "the derived star formation rate is 1 . assuming the whole galaxy behaves like a starburst ( -starburst )",
    ", we obtain 10.1 .",
    "this assumption is probably over - estimating the star formation rate as the starburst is located only in the center .",
    "the extinction based on the balmer decrement gives a sfr of 3.3 and the one based on a combination of the tir / fuv ratio and profiles provides 3.6 ( a similar value of 4 is obtained from the low - resolution tir / fuv extinction profile ) . to summarize ,",
    "we used galex observations of m83 in combination with other data to compare several extinction indicators ( the uv spectral slope method giving poor results ) , and to estimate the effect of extinction on the determination of the sfr . differences of a factor up to 2.5 are obtained with the various methods .",
    "moreover , we determined an extinction - free sfr profile allowing to check the validity of the sfr law used in evolutionary models .",
    "a similar analysis will be applied to a larger number of galaxies observed by galex in the future .",
