    "we consider what the requirements for bulge - forming mergers must be in order for the merger history of galactic halos in @xmath0cdm to account statistically for the observed fraction of galaxies today which are `` disk - dominated '' ",

    "we explore a simple model in which bulge formation due to merger is controlled by two parameters , mass ratio @xmath3 and the virial velocity of the larger halo , @xmath4 .",
    "the hypothesis of the model is that a bulge forms if and only if ,    @xmath5    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : disk - dominated - fraction ] shows the fraction of galaxies without classical bulge ( disk - dominated galaxies ) as a function of the bulge formation criterion @xmath6 , which is the result of the model described in   [ sec : hypothesis ] some of the contours are also labeled by the morphological type of galaxy in the _ tully catalogue _ such that the observed fraction of galaxies of that morphological type or later equals the theoretical fraction of disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "we assume that galaxies of type sc and later are the disk - dominated population .",
    "fraction of sc or later is @xmath7 in the tully subsample , which is also consistent with other observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "so , the @xmath8-values for which our bulge formation hypothesis predicts the observed disk - dominated - galaxy fraction @xmath7 are shown by the bold contour in fig .",

    "somewhat smaller @xmath10 and larger @xmath11 , or vice versa , are also plausible .",

    "in order to explain the observed fraction of disk - dominated galaxies within @xmath0cdm cosmology , we propose a bulge - forming criterion such that only those mergers with @xmath14 and @xmath15 form bulges .",
    "the validity of this bulge formation criterion needs to confirmed by further study of low - mass mergers @xmath16 by , e.g. , hydro simulations .",
    "the mass dependence of the disk - dominated fraction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass - dependence ] ) can be explained , too , if merger remnants which are small compared to the present halo mass are too small to be observed as a classical bulge .",
    "future surveys of bulgeless / pseudobulged galaxy fraction as a function of mass would be useful for determining the bulge - formation criterion and testing this hypothesis .",
