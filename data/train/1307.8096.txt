    "time - resolved experiments which selectively excite either the electrons or phonons can provide new insights and even lead to metastable states of matter with interesting properties .",
    "for example , in the insulating charge - density wave compound 1@xmath1-tas@xmath2 , a purely electronically driven insulator - to - metal transition has been found in time - resolved photo - emission experiments.@xcite optical pump - probe spectroscopy was used to estimate electron - phonon coupling strengths in high-@xmath0 superconductors.@xcite squeezed phonon states , resulting from a pulse - induced softening of certain phonon modes in bismuth , have been measured with time - resolved @xmath3-ray pump - probe spectroscopy.@xcite most interestingly , the selective excitation of apical oxygen modes in certain cuprate materials using thz pulses , has been shown to induce a transient superconducting state above the equilibrium @xmath0.@xcite    motivated by these experimental developments , several theoretical works have recently addressed the nonequilibrium dynamics of electron - phonon coupled systems .",

    "a quantum mechanical treatment of the dynamics and nonlinear transport characteristics of one or two polarons in the holstein model was presented in refs .  .",
    "these calculations employed a time - dependent lanczos scheme in a variational hilbert space.@xcite pump excitations of the two - dimensional holstein model were investigated using time - dependent lattice perturbation theory ( migdal approximation).@xcite    few methods exist which can handle lattice models in @xmath4 and in the particularly challenging regime of strong electron - electron and electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the two - temperature model,@xcite which assumes that the electronic relaxation is fast compared to the timescale of phonons , is certainly inadequate in this case , since it has been demonstrated that the relaxation time in purely electronic systems with a gap can be much longer than typical phonon oscillation times.@xcite it is therefore important to develop a formalism which can describe the feedback of the quantum phonons on the electronic relaxation process and the effect of the nonequilibrium state of the electrons on the evolution of the phonons",

    "in the interaction regime where a phonon - enhanced relaxation is possible , the double - occupancy changes in a step - like manner after each echo event and it is not really possible to extract a relaxation time .      as a second example , we study the time - evolution after a rapid change in the electron - phonon coupling @xmath12 .",
    "we will consider the exponential switching ( [ exp_relax ] ) from @xmath239 to @xmath240 with time - constant @xmath241 .",

    "however , in the holstein - hubbard case , where @xmath249 means that the very strong instantaneous repulsion @xmath247 is to a large extent compensated by a strong phonon - induced attraction @xmath250 , the relaxation of the double occupancy towards the higher thermal value is seen to be very slow , which is a clear indication that these systems are more strongly correlated than a static description with interaction @xmath243 would suggest . this observation is consistent with the finding of ref .  , which showed that in equilibrium and at low enough temperature , the proper static description for the holstein - hubbard model involves the interaction @xmath243 _ and _ a reduced bandwidth .",
    "for @xmath232 the bandwidth reduction factor is @xmath251 .",
    "while the effective static description is not accurate in the present case of @xmath191 , strong electron - phonon coupling , and strong excitation of the phonons , it nevertheless provides some insight into the observed slow dynamics .",
    "it is also important to note that after the quench , @xmath243 will oscillate between @xmath252 and @xmath253 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_g ] , bottom left panel ) , so that the instantaneous interaction periodically switches from strongly repulsive to attractive . in such a situation , the interpretation of the dynamics in terms of an equilibrium model seems difficult .",
    "+    it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig_double_exp ] that the relaxation of the double occupancy , at least in the time interval which is plotted , is not exponential .",
    "rather , the double occupancy increases roughly linearly , with superimposed oscillations that are almost undamped .",
    "these oscillations are due to the periodic modulation of the lang - firsov shifted interaction strength @xmath254 .",
    "a similar roughly linear increase in the double occupancy was found in nonequilibrium dmft simulations of the hubbard model with a periodically modulated @xmath6.@xcite the slopes of such curves are measured in modulation spectroscopy experiments on cold atom systems , to determine the mott phase and the mott gap ( interaction strength @xmath6).@xcite in the present case the coherent excitation of phonons by the @xmath12-quench leads to a periodic oscillation of @xmath243 with frequency @xmath11 , which in turn may enhance the production of doublons if the gap size is a multiple of the phonon frequency .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_double_exp ] , the slope of a linear fit to the doublon curves ( doublon production rate ) exhibits a nontrivial dependence on @xmath6 and hence on the gap - size .",
    "for example , the production rate is substantially larger for @xmath255 than for @xmath256 , even though the gap in the latter case is smaller .",
    "the slopes are plotted as a function of @xmath6 in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ slope_exp ] .",
    "the doublon production is enhanced for @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 and strongly suppressed for @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 . to understand this behavior and relate it to the gap size",
    ", we now analyze the spectral functions .",
    "+    because of the periodic driving , the time - dependent spectral function obtained from the fourier transform of the retarded green s function is oscillating and not necessarily positive .",
    "however , the time - averaged spectral function ( averaged over one phonon oscillation period ) rapidly converges to the positive function shown ( for @xmath263 ) in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ spectrum_exp ] .",
    "the overall shape is similar to the thermal spectral function at @xmath232 ( top right panel ) , but there are important differences . in particular , the time - averaged nonequilibrium spectral function can not be reproduced by increasing the temperature of the thermal spectrum , as is illustrated for @xmath247 in the lower panel of the figure .",
    "while raising the temperature leads to a broadening of the peaks , similar to what is seen in the nonequilibrium result , the heating leads to a filling - in of the gap by more and more prominent side - bands .",
    "the time - averaged nonequilibrium spectral function , on the other hand , contains even less weight in the gap region than the original @xmath192 thermal spectrum .",
    "therefore , the nonequilibrium spectral function is not similar to that of a thermal state at higher temperature , but rather resembles a broadened version of the spectral function of the initial state .    extracting the gap size from the peak - to - peak distance between the first prominent side - peaks in the time - averaged spectrum , we find that @xmath264 and @xmath258 correspond to a gap of approximately @xmath11 and @xmath199 . a plot of the doublon production rate as a function of gap size ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ slope_exp ] ) shows that the production of doublons is enhanced whenever the gap - size is a multiple of the phonon frequency .    finally , let us take a closer look at the shape of the double occupancy @xmath226 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_double_exp ] .",
    "the zig - zag shape of some of the curves indicates that many fourier modes are excited . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_double_osc ] we subtract the time - average of @xmath226 over one period , @xmath265 , to extract the superimposed modulations .",
    "the fourier transformation of @xmath266 on the time - interval @xmath267 gives the spectra shown in the lower panel of the figure .",
    "these spectra show that the modulations are a superposition of modes with @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and that the curve for @xmath264 ( corresponding to phonon - enhanced doublon production ) has larger contributions from higher frequency modes than the curve for @xmath270 ( which corresponds to a minimum in the doublon production rate ) .",
    "a similar result is found if we compare the spectra for @xmath255 ( maximum in the doublon production rate ) and @xmath256 ( minimum in the doublon production rate ) .",
    "we have developed a formalism to treat electron - phonon couplings of the holstein - type within nonequilibrium dmft .",
    "a generalized lang - firsov transformation , based on a simultaneous ( time - dependent ) shift of the phonon coordiante and momentum , allows to decouple the electrons and phonons and to evaluate the phonon contribution in a strong - coupling ( hybridization ) expansion on the kadanoff - baym contour . while the resulting formalism is exact , an efficient nonequilibrium dmft calculation requires some approximate impurity solver .",
    "we proposed approximate schemes based on the non - crossing and one - crossing approximation , and tested them against the exact results in equilibrium .",
    "these tests suggest that even the simplest non - crossing approximation allows a qualitatively correct description of the competition between the instantaneous coulomb repulsion and the phonon - mediated attractive interaction in the mott insulating phase , as well as the transitions to the bipolaronic insulating phase .",
    "the formalism for externally driven phonons showed that in a homogeneous bulk system , the perturbation does not propagate into the dmft self - consistency , so that the effect of the external driving is essentially trivial .",
    "interesting effects may show up in an inhomogeneous set - up or in a two - sublattice system with a sublattice - dependent force .",
    "the investigation of these effects is left for a future project . here , we focused on the evolution of doublons in the mott insulating holstein - hubbard model , after an interaction pulse and after a rapid increase in the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the interaction pulse provides a convenient way to excite electrons across the mott gap ( production of doublon - holon pairs in a broad spectral range ) and we studied the decay of these nonthermal doublons as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "we showed that the relaxation time decreases whenever the gap in the spectral function is a multiple of the phonon - frequency . in this case",
    "doublons and holons can efficiently recombine by transferring their energy to the lattice .",
    "a rapid increase of the electron - phonon coupling leads to a decrease in the effective instantaneous interaction and thus to an increase of the equilibrium density of doublons . in this case one",
    "finds an enhancement of the doublon production rate whenever the gap is a multiple of the phonon frequencies .",
    "the dynamics is also strongly influenced by the excitation of the phonons during the quench , which leads to a persistent ( weakly damped ) oscillation in the effective electron - electron interaction and a periodic flow of energy between the electronic system and the lattice .",
    "this periodic driving leads to an essentially linear increase in the number of doublons , similar to what is observed in a hubbard model with periodically modulated interaction .",
