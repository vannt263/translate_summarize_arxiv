    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) 050904 was an explosive event at redshift of @xmath0 , which has been measured through various methods @xcite .",
    "after the swift trigger @xcite , multi - wavelength observations of this high - redshift burst were performed .",
    "the @xmath1-ray isotropic - equivalent energy of this burst @xmath2 was between @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the optical emission at times of 86 s to 1666 s. the optical afterglow and its spectrum were analyzed quickly @xcite .",
    "a break of the optical afterglow light curve was also observed at about @xmath5 days @xcite .",
    "the optical emission appears to be understood in either both the late internal shock model or the reverse - forward shock model @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of this burst is a long lasting variability of the x - ray emission , showing several x - ray flares ( xrfs ) . @xcite and @xcite suggested that this variability may be due to a long - lasting activity of the central engine .",
    "the xrfs were also found in some other grbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite assumed late central engine activities to interpret the xrfs .",
    "the plausible origin models of xrfs were recently proposed , e.g. , the magnetic activity of a newborn millisecond pulsar @xcite , fragmentation of a neutron star by a black hole in a compact object binary @xcite , fragmentation of an accretion disk @xcite , and magnetic barrier  driven modulation of an accretion disk @xcite . however , there has not yet been any explicit and detailed investigation on this highly - variable light curve .",
    "enlightened by the internal shock model to interpret the @xmath1-ray emission @xcite and prompt optical emission @xcite , we assume that all the highly - variable x - ray emission ( even at very late times ) originate from internal shocks .",
    "these shocks occur when many faster shells with equal energy and equal mass catch up with a slower shell with much more kinetic energy and mass . by fitting the peaks of the x - ray and optical light curves , we find that these internal shocks can lead to the observed x - ray and optical emission .",
    "we describe an internal - shock model in ",
    "[ theory ] , fit the peaks of x - ray and optical light curves of grb 050904 in  [ grb050904 ] .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ discussion ] .",
    "we assume two cold shells labeled with 1 and 4 , whose isotropic kinetic energies are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , widths are @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the cosmological rest frame , and lorentz factors are @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , respectively .",
    "the shells come from the central engine with time lag @xmath13 ( also in the rest frame ) .",
    "shell 4 catches up with shell 1 at radius @xmath14 and then two internal shocks occur , that is , a forward shock that propagates into shell 1 and a reverse shock that propagates into shell 4 .",
    "four regions are divided by the reverse and forward shocks : unshocked shell 1 ( region 1 ) , shocked gas of shell 1 ( region 2 ) , shocked gas of shell 4 ( region 3 ) and unshocked shell 4 ( region 4 ) , with a contact discontinuity ( cd ) surface separating region 2 and region 3 .",
    "figure [ fig : sketch ] gives a sketch of this model .",
    "the number densities of region 1 and region 4 at radius @xmath15 are @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . to produce plenty of x - rays and @xmath1-rays",
    ", it is required that the reverse - shocked materials are relativistic , i.e. , @xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the relative lorentz factor between regions 4 and 3 , and the number density ratio is defined as @xmath20 .    to calculate the width of the coasting shell , we define the spreading radius @xmath21 @xcite . for the internal shocks of our interests , if @xmath22 , the width of the shells can be considered to be constant , and for @xmath23 , the width should be regarded as @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the spreading of the shells .",
    "the conventional notation @xmath26 with cgs units is used in this paper except for special explanations .",
    "we now consider these two cases .      at radius @xmath27 , for a certain set of parameters @xmath28 , one obtains @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the relative lorentz factor between regions 4 and 1 ) , implying that the forward shock is newtonian , and @xmath31 , which shows that the reverse shock is relativistic .",
    "using the shock conditions @xcite , and keeping equality of pressures and lorentz factors of the materials at two sides of the contact discontinuity @xcite , we can obtain the number densities @xmath32 , and energy densities @xmath33 of the shocked regions in the comoving frame , @xmath34 the lorentz factor @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is the observer s time .    assuming that the reverse shock lasts from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , we find @xmath39 , which corresponds to a pulse from the beginning to peak . in the observer s frame ( @xmath40 ) , this lasting time is @xmath41    by considering the synchrotron emission at the reverse shock - crossing time , which corresponds to the peak emission time",
    ", we obtain the characteristic frequencies @xmath42 and @xmath43 , cooling frequencies @xmath44 and @xmath45 , synchrotron self - absorption frequencies @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the maximum flux densities @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the observer s frame ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for original formulae of synchrotron emission ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the spectral index of the shock - accelerated electrons , @xmath53 is the luminosity distance from the burst to the observer ( as a function of redshift @xmath54 ) , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the fractions of the internal energy density that were carried by electrons and magnetic fields , respectively . in this paper , @xmath52 is taken to be @xmath57 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are equal for both region 2 and region 3 .",
    "note that the expressions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are only valid in the cases of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    from the above equations , we see @xmath60 and @xmath61 for typical parameters .",
    "the flux density in the fast - cooling case at the peak time is then given by @xmath62 @xmath63 for the forward shock emission , and @xmath64 @xmath65 for the reverse shock emission .",
    "in the case of @xmath23 , the widths of the shells become @xmath66 and @xmath67 because of the spreading effect . for the same parameters as  [ nospreading ] , @xmath68 , showing that the forward shock can be considered as newtonian approximately , and @xmath69 , implying that the reverse shock is still relativistic .    using the shock conditions as in  [ nospreading ] , we obtain @xmath70 the distance for the reverse shock to cross shell 4 is @xmath71 , and the rising time of the pulse in the observer s frame is @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding emission values at the peak time are given by @xmath73 note that the expressions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are valid only in the cases of @xmath74 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "in the case of @xmath74 , the corresponding flux density of the forward shock emission is @xmath62 @xmath75 as the cooling frequency @xmath44 exceeds the self - absorption frequency @xmath46 at time @xmath76s , the corresponding emission after this time is then @xmath62 @xmath77    the flux density of the reverse shock emission in the case of @xmath59 is given by @xmath64 @xmath78 at time @xmath79s , @xmath80 .",
    "after that time , the order of the break frequencies becomes @xmath81 . in this case",
    ", the flux density becomes @xmath64 @xmath82 from equations ( [ eq : ff_nu_3_spreading ] ) and ( [ eq : fs_nu_3_spreading ] ) , we can see that the flux densities are the same for the case in which the observed frequency exceeds the three break frequencies .",
    "we consider that many shells like the foregoing shell 4 collide with shell 1 at different radii @xmath37 , where @xmath37 indicates the observed time by the relation @xmath83 .",
    "thus the peaks of emission obey a power law temporal profile . under more realistic conditions , `` shell 1 '' may be sole , proceeding at the front , and many shells like `` shell 4 '' ejected from the central engine continually overtake `` shell 1 '' ( see figure [ fig : sketch ] ) . as the energy of `` shell 1 '' is assumed to be much greater than that of `` shell 4 '' , the dynamics of `` shell 1 '' after the collision can be almost unchanged , and thus the above relations are still applicable . in the popular collapsar model , `` shell 1 '' can be understood as due to the envelope of a collapsing massive star . because a relativistic outflow needs to accumulate enough energy to break out of the envelope and is inevitably polluted by the baryons in the envelope , this outflow ( i.e. ,  shell 1 \" ) should be more energetic but have less lorentz factor comparing with `` shell 4 '' .",
    "using the above model , we fit the peaks of the x - ray light curves of grb 050904 in the observer s frame .",
    "we consider the model parameters @xmath84 , and @xmath85 and the cosmology with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "these parameters lead to a newtonian forward shock and a relativistic reverse shock .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : x - peaks ] , the solid line with four segments is fitted analytically .",
    "the flux is an integral of flux density in a frequency range of @xmath88hz to @xmath89hz , which corresponds to xrt s 0.2 - 10 kev band .",
    "the temporal breaks are due to crossing of the three break frequencies .",
    "the first segment represents the emission from a relativistic reverse shock with a constant shell width , which satisfies equation ( [ eq : f_nu_nos_canum ] ) with temporal index @xmath90 . at time @xmath91",
    "s , the corresponding radius is @xmath92 , while the spreading radii of region 1 and region 4 are @xmath93 , and @xmath94 respectively .",
    "the three radii are approximately equal , and thus @xmath95 can be taken as the common spreading radius of regions 1 and 4 .",
    "after the first break time , regions 1 and 4 should be spreading and the flux density is described by the third expression of equation ( [ eq : f_nu_s_acnum ] ) .",
    "the temporal index is @xmath96 . up to @xmath97s ,",
    "the frequency @xmath98hz decreases to the observed frequencies of xrt , and then the order of the break frequencies becomes @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "the flux density is given by the last expression of equation ( [ eq : f_nu_s_acmnu ] ) , and the temporal index of flux is @xmath101 .",
    "after @xmath102s , the order is @xmath103 , and the temporal index becomes @xmath104 .",
    "observationally it was reported that the photon indices are @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( whose corresponding spectral indices are @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively ) at early and late times respectively @xcite",
    ". the observer s time at which the spectral index changed is about 350s .",
    "this time can be naturally understood as the crossing time of @xmath109 to @xmath110 . before this crossing time ,",
    "@xmath111 and the spectral index is @xmath112 , and after this crossing time , @xmath113 and the index is @xmath114 .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the spectral index evolution and a sketch for the evolution of spectral energy distribution .",
    "these spectral indices are generally slightly less than the observed ones , because our model only gives the spectral indices at the peak times but the observations were performed in relatively broad ranges of time . at the beginning of each pair of reverse and forward shocks , the cooling frequency @xmath115 is very large @xcite , because this frequency is proportional to @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the comoving time of the shocks .",
    "thus @xmath115 can be larger than @xmath110 during the initial stage of the shocks . in the case of @xmath118 ,",
    "the spectral index is @xmath119 , which makes the observed spectral index larger than the expected values @xmath120 and @xmath114 .",
    "the optical data during the same period were reported @xcite . the observed j - band ( @xmath121hz ) data are plotted in figure [ fig : x - peaks ] in units of magnitude . using the above parameters",
    ", we plot a line representing the j - band peak flux density .",
    "however , the j - band emission may be mainly contributed by the forward shocks . since",
    "the forward shocks are newtonian , the emission contributes more at optical band than does at the x - ray band . furthermore , as the number density of the forward - shocked region is much larger than that of the reverse shocks ( see equations ( [ eq : n2_spreading ] ) and ( [ eq : n3_spreading ] ) ) , the contribution to the j - band emission exceeds that of the reverse shocks . to show the contribution of the forward shocks , figure [ fig : rfs ] duplicates figure [ fig : x - peaks ] but counts in the forward shocks .",
    "it is reasonable to see that the fitted peaks are greater than the observed data .",
    "as the fitting lines stand for the peak fluxes of the emission of internal shocks , these fluxes should be greater than the time - averaged observed data especially for the optical emission , which lasts a relatively longer time for the observation . if there are not reverse - forward shocks at a certain time",
    ", the observed flux density should be much less than the expected peak one .",
    "therefore , the fitting solid line is basically consistent with the observed data .",
    "for the highest ( fourth ) j - band point ( 449s-589s ) and the x - ray peak nearly at the same time , we suggest that they could arise from the same internal shocks , and the x - ray peak could occur only at time slightly earlier than @xmath122s ( we circled them in figure [ fig : rfs ] for emphasis ) .",
    "there is a time lag ( @xmath123s ) between the x - ray emission and the j - band emission .",
    "this may be caused by a spectral time lag @xcite , the different refractivities of photons in different energy bands during the propagation from the source to the earth , or a quantum gravity effect ( which is also due to different refractivities in vacuum for different photons , @xcite ) .",
    "there has also been an example with a long time lag , grb 980425 @xcite , which shows the probability of time lag with tens of seconds .",
    "we further show that our model is consistent with the observed data at some other aspects .",
    "firstly , the lorentz factor of region 1 should not change significantly during the period of x - ray emission .",
    "because faster ejected shells ( region 4 ) have much less kinetic energy than the front slower one ( region 1 ) and the forward shocks are newtonian , the lorentz factor and the particle number of region 1 do not increase significantly when it is overtaken by faster shells . on the other hand",
    ", we estimate the deceleration radius @xmath124^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath125 is the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy , and @xmath126 is the medium density . letting the gamma - ray isotropic equivalent energy be @xmath127erg , which is consistent with the observation range @xcite , and assuming the radiative efficiency @xmath128 and the medium density @xmath129 , we obtain @xmath130 .",
    "this energy is consistent with the parameters assumed above .",
    "and then the deceleration radius is @xmath131 , which corresponds to the observed time @xmath132 e_{0,55}^{1/3 } \\gamma_{1.5}^{-8/3 } n_{0.5}^{-1/3 } \\rm{s}$ ] .",
    "this deceleration time is larger than the x - ray duration time , indicating that region 1 is not decelerated by the ambient medium during this period .",
    "secondly , the lorentz factor at the jet - break time @xcite is about @xmath133 ( @xmath134 )",
    ". it should be greater at an earlier time .",
    "this is in agreement with our used parameter ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "thirdly , we note the photon indices at the second break of the fitting x - ray peak line in figure [ fig : x - peaks ] .",
    "the indices are @xmath136 during the time period of ( 149s , 223s ) , @xmath137 during the time period of ( 223s , 303s ) in the bat data , and @xmath138 during the time period of ( 169s , 209s ) , @xmath139 during the time period of ( 209s , 269s ) , @xmath140 during the time period of ( 269s , 371s ) in the xrt data ( table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* where the time is divided by @xmath141 to give the local observer s frame ) .",
    "it can be seen that the photon indices of the bat data are greater than those of the xrt data . in our model",
    ", the frequency @xmath109 is crossing the observed frequency during this period .",
    "for the frequency orders @xmath111 and @xmath113 , the flux densities are scaled as @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively . therefore , the spectrum is harder for the lower - frequency emission than for the higher - frequency emission , which is consistent with the observed data .",
    "fourthly , the mean intrinsic column density is @xmath144 , as measured by xrt @xcite .",
    "this high density can not be explained by the ambient medium with assumed number density @xmath145 . because the radiation originates from the reverse - forward shocks and should pass through `` shell 1 '' , we find that the column density of `` shell 1 '' is @xmath146 , which is @xmath147 at radius @xmath148 cm and @xmath149 at radius @xmath150 cm",
    ". these values are basically consistent with the measured mean column density .",
    "therefore , the materials in `` shell 1 '' provide an explanation for the high column density measured by xrt .",
    "finally , there are several low peaks in figure [ fig : x - peaks ] at about @xmath151s .",
    "they may be caused by non - uniform lorentz factors or energies of the ejected rapid shells .    in short ,",
    "the x - ray flares are understood as due to the internal shocks .",
    "these shocks are caused by the continually ejected faster shells that overtake the sole slower one with much larger kinetic energy and much more baryons .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a simple internal shock model : a slower massive shell propagates in the front , and many faster shells with similar mass and energy catch up with the front slower shell at different radii .",
    "these collisions lead to reverse - forward shocks .",
    "the shocks produce the @xmath1-ray and lower - energy emission by synchrotron radiation .",
    "we obtained a `` normal '' set of parameters to fit the peak fluxes of xrfs of grb 050904 , and found that our model is well consistent with the observations including the early optical data .    for grb 050904",
    ", we also found that the contribution of the forward shock emission is insignificant in the x - ray band , but significant in the j - band at early times , because the frequency of emission from the newtonian forward shocks mainly lies in the optical band .",
    "however , we should note that , for other bursts , forward shocks may also be important for the x - ray emission . if the leading shell ( `` shell 1 '' ) is not more energetic than the followed faster shells ( `` shells 4 '' ) , the velocity of `` shell 1 '' can not be regarded as unchanged after some collisions and the simple model in section [ theory ] is invalid . if the parameters differ , the deceleration radius may be smaller , and the external shock may become important .",
    "all the effects would change the profile of the xrf peaks .",
    "in general , we argued that some long bursts should have the same properties : the peaks are nearly constant before the time at which @xmath109 is just equal to the observed frequency @xmath110 , and decline rapidly with temporal index about @xmath152 after this time .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1-ray emission of these bursts persists up to the time when @xmath153 , and disappears because of the rapid decline . in this case , the @xmath1-ray emission ceases when the peak energy @xmath154 .",
    "there are two other reasons for the disappearance of @xmath1-rays .",
    "one is that the flux of @xmath1-ray emission decreases below the detectable limits of telescopes when the frequency order is still @xmath111 .",
    "the other is the turnoff of the central engine when @xmath109 is still larger than @xmath110 . only in the latter case",
    ", it can be said that the @xmath1-rays duration is the burst duration .",
