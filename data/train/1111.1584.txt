    "the interaction of an atomic system with a radiation field in the regime of x - rays will lead to its ionization",
    ". the most dominant process will be , first , the ejection of an inner - shell electron ( photo - electron ) with the absorption of a photon followed either by an intra - atomic auger and/or a fluorescence transition .",
    "for relatively light atomic systems , the dominant decay channel of the single - hole singly - charged system is through an ( radiationless ) auger transition , designated as normal auger which is a manifestation of electron - electron interaction .",
    "one variation on this scenario is to promote an inner - shell electron to an excited bound state , often denoted as resonant auger state ( ras ) , which can decay either through an auger transition or by the emission of an x - ray photon .",
    "this process was first reported by brown @xcite and since then a large number of investigations have taken place ( see for example @xcite and references there in ) .    under excitation by the strong radiation fields , now available , from free electron laser ( fel ) sources @xcite , the situation becomes considerably different .",
    "relevant studies in the context of strong laser fields have been reported quite early @xcite and in response to recent developments in the x - ray wavelength regime a number of theoretical and experimental works have already appeared @xcite . in the simplest situation , rohringer and santra in ref . @xcite",
    "have studied the single - photon excitation of a neon k - shell electron to a ras by an x - ray field and a multipeak auger electron spectrum ( aes ) is obtained for the fields they considered .     transition energy . ]    in this work , we examine the aes and the ionic yields in the case where a normal auger process takes place ( as opposed to the ras process ) which involves photoionization of the neutral from the k - shell , followed by an auger decay of the singly charged hole - system to the doubly charged ion .",
    "we demonstrate the emergence of ac - stark splitting ( also known as autler - townes splitting @xcite ) of the auger resonance , resulting from strong rabi - coupling of the apposite states in the resulting ne@xmath0 ion .",
    "in contrast to ras line - shape modification @xcite , the unusual phenomenon here is that the ac - stark splitting is manifested in the kinetic spectrum of the auger electron while strong rabi - coupling occurs to one of the k - shell electrons of the doubly - charged ion .",
    "this effect requires an explanation on the basis of a two - electron representation of the auger - electron ejection , instead of an ambiguous one - electron picture implied by the rabi - type oscillation of an inner - electron .",
    "a detailed study of the two - electron representation , in a different context and formalism but similar physical background , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have chosen as the target of our study neutral neon in it s ground state @xmath1ne@xmath2 @xmath3 and consider radiation with a photon energy of approximately @xmath4 ev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the ionization potential for the creation of a k - shell hole @xmath5ne@xmath6 @xmath7 is @xmath8 ev .",
    "note that all the energies of the neon states are given relative to the neutral neon ground state .",
    "thus , the x - ray radiation will eject a k - shell photo - electron with a kinetic energy of ca . @xmath9 ev .",
    "ionization from the outer shells is also possible but with much lower probability @xcite .",
    "the generated k - shell hole ne@xmath10 will decay , by filling the @xmath11 vacancy , predominantly to the doubly charged neon state @xmath12 = @xmath13ne@xmath14 @xmath15 with energy @xmath16 ev , and auger decay width @xmath17 ev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ne@xmath10 ion with one k - shell hole can also decay through fluorescence by emitting x - ray radiation @xcite .",
    "this channel is about 55 times weaker than the auger decay rate .",
    "let s designate the sum of all decay channels of the @xmath18 state as @xmath19 . normally , this auger transition of the singly charged ion to the doubly charged ground state is accompanied by the ejection of an electron ( auger - elecron ) with a kinetic energy @xmath20 ev and a lorentzian line profile . in the present case",
    "we have chosen the photon energy to match the ne@xmath21 transition energy . around this energy",
    "there is a manifold of excited states which we denote collectively as @xmath22 .",
    "we show in table 1 those states which lie within a 1 ev band around the excitation photon energy .",
    "while the auger state @xmath18 decays with a lifetime of about @xmath23 fs , the field , through a rabi - type transition , creates a coherent superposition of the ionic ground state @xmath24 and all accessible excited states @xmath25 .",
    "this rabi - oscillation of the k - shell electron between the bound states of the ne@xmath0 ion will induce an ac - stark splitting manifested in the kinetic energy of the ejected auger - electron .",
    "we should note that no post - collision interaction with the photo - electron is taken into account , as the energy of the photoelectron is too large for such an effect to contribute in the auger s electron spectrum ( and vice - versa ) . to complete the picture , the excited states @xmath22 decay either through an additional auger process ( @xmath26 ) or through further ionization by absorbing one more photon ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "finally , direct creation of a double core - hole ne@xmath0 of the neutral , through photoabsorption , is not considered since the double k - shell ionization energy is 1863 ev @xcite .",
    "we discuss below the manner in which the aes is modified due to the rabi - coupling of the ne@xmath21 states and study it s behaviour in a quantitative manner . to facilitate the interpretation of the results ,",
    "we note at this point that for a modification of the auger line to appear , many rabi - oscillations should occur within the relevant auger lifetime .",
    "equivalently , in the energy domain , it is required that the energy separation of the auger - line splitting ( roughly equal to rabi coupling strength ) should be larger than the auger decay width or the x - ray bandwidth , whichever is larger .",
    "of course the detailed properties of the system and the field will matter as well , however the rule of thumb , as expressed above will be in general true .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the theoretical formulation and develop the decription of the processes in terms of a time - dependent density matrix system of equations . in section iii",
    "we show some of the results of our present study in the case of a single - mode coherent field . in the final section ( sec .",
    "iv ) we summarize our findings and discuss , very briefly , two aspects of the problem that are necessary to put the description of the problem closer to the actual experimental conditions , namely the fluctuations present in a fel field and the field s spatial dependance .",

    "then the rabi frequency , ac - stark level shifts and the ionization widths become independent on time and in the expression for the aes only the population of @xmath36 is time - dependent : @xmath159 \\nonumber \\\\                    & = & i m [ ( \\delta_{a}+\\delta_{a ' } - i\\frac{\\gamma_i}{2 } ) ( \\omega^{+}_{a'}-\\omega^{-}_{a ' } ) ] \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } dt\\sigma_{ii}(t ) . \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving the eqns ( [ eq : sigma_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma_2 ] ) for @xmath160 we find that @xmath161 and after some algebra we end up to the following analytical expression for the aes :    @xmath162 .",
    "\\label{eq : aes}\\ ] ]    we should note here , that the predictions of the analytical expression differ from the numerical solution in that it does nt include the transient effects of the physical process which are expected to occur at times of the order of @xmath163 :",
    "in fig . 2 we show the effect of the field strength in the auger spectra for @xmath164 ev and assume a pulse envelope @xmath165 , with @xmath166 being the total pulse duration equal to about 20 times the auger life time @xmath167 fs ( fwhm = 24.4 fs ) .",
    "more specifically in all the following calculations the field included 10754 cycles .",
    "the ionization width of the neutral is given by @xmath168 a.u .. in the calculation we only include the @xmath169 = @xmath13ne@xmath170 @xmath28f @xmath171 excited state [ state 3 of table 1 ] and assume its decay width to be zero ( @xmath172 ) . for this , on - resonance process ( @xmath173 ) , the rabi interaction energy is found to be @xmath174 a.u .. according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : aes ] ) , for peak intensities of @xmath175 and @xmath176 w/@xmath109 peak separations ( of equal height ) of about @xmath177 and @xmath178 ev , respectively , should be expected for the aes .",
    "particularly , for the lowest intensity of @xmath179 the peak separation is comparable to the auger decay width ( 0.27 ev ) , thus the separation is hardly seen .",
    "the latter values coincide with the full numerical solutions , shown in fig 2 . in general , according to the above formula , for on - resonance conditions and long pulses ( compared to @xmath163 ) a change of the splitting by a factor around 3.2 should be expected , for a change of the peak intensity by one order of magnitude . for off - resonance conditions we have two unequal peaks with energy separation again determined from the generalized rabi - frequency @xmath180 and relative height determined from the field detuning @xmath181 .    .",
    "the inset label give the peak intensity values in units of w/@xmath109 . ]",
    "next we turn to the case where the decay channels of the excited core states @xmath182 are present .",
    "we have found that for the intensities and photon energy considered , further photoionization of @xmath47 is a much weaker channel compared with a ras transition to ne@xmath183 @xcite .",
    "we take the ras width to be a large fraction of ne@xmath184 ne@xmath185 decay width and assume @xmath186 ev @xcite . in this case",
    "the life time of these excited ionic states @xmath182 is about 4.12 fs , comparable to the auger decay life time of interest here ( @xmath187 2.45 fs ) but still much shorter than the pulse duration . given that the rabi coupling saturates the ne@xmath21 transition very quickly ( in the sense that their populations are almost equalized ) it can be expected that a large portion of the population will very quickly decay to the ne@xmath183 ion .",
    "this behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "3 where the final populations in ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath183 are plotted as a function of the peak intensity of the applied x - ray field .",
    "thus for on - resonance cases ( solid lines ) we see that the majority of the population goes into ne@xmath183 ion for all intensities considered . on the other hand ,",
    "if we choose to detune the fel to a photon energy of 904.06 ev ( dashed lines ) , efficient population of the excited ionic state @xmath188 is prohibited .",
    "this also causes an effective increase in the magnitude of the generalized rabi frequency according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rabi ] ) . in that case",
    "the situation changes dramatically .",
    "the relative population ratio is reversed for low intensity fields ( @xmath189 w/@xmath109 ) , with the ne@xmath0 dominating up to higher intensities where the ratio starts to decline in favor of the ne@xmath183 yield .",
    "thus , it appears that a careful combination of the intensity and the photon energy of the field can control the relative populations of the triply and doubly ionic species of neon .",
    "solid curves refer to @xmath190 ev while the dashed ones to @xmath191 904.06 ev . ]    it is worth to note here that for the present long pulses and for relatively strong fields ( @xmath192 w/@xmath109 ) , the depletion of the neutral neon might be significant . for example ,",
    "for @xmath193 w/@xmath109 the remaining neutral neon is 0.718 while for ten times stronger field @xmath194 w/@xmath109 decreases to 0.036 .",
    "furthermore , it should also be noted that ionic species higher than triply and doubly ionized neon are not expected to contribute significantly as two- or multi- photon absorption is an unlikely ionization channel , given their ionization potentials and the large photon energy .",
    "finally , a small fraction of ne@xmath195 is produced through the fluorescence of the metastable k - shell hole ne@xmath195 ion .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the populations of the ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath21 excited states as a function of time for a field of peak intensity @xmath196 w/@xmath109 . we have considered two different frequencies as in the case of fig .",
    "3 , which represent the on - resonance ( 908.06 , ev - solid lines ) and off - resonance ( 904.06 , dashed - lines ) conditions . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the populations of ne@xmath0 and ne@xmath21 are quickly ( almost ) equalized , thus allowing for the efficient production of the ne@xmath183 ion through the auger decay of the excited ne@xmath21 state with the ejection of one more electron ( @xmath186 ev ) . with off - resonance conditions we see that the same populations evolve differently with the amount of ne@xmath183 that is produced being significantly smaller than the ne@xmath0 yield for a broad range of intensities .",
    "of course , even in the detuned case , when the intensity becomes higher , the rabi amplitude will increase accordingly and again the quick transfer from the ground ne@xmath0 to the excited ne@xmath21 state will allow the efficient production of the ne@xmath183 ion .",
    "in that case ne@xmath183 yield will surpass ne@xmath0 yield . by inspection of fig .",
    "3 , the intensities that this overtaking of ne@xmath183 takes place are beyond @xmath197 w/@xmath109 .     and ne@xmath21 states as a function of time peak intensity @xmath198 w/@xmath109 .",
    "all other parameters as in fig .",
    "we have presented a theory of the auger kinetic spectra and ionization yields based on the time - dependent density matrix theory which encapsulates all the essential dynamical parameters of the physical processes that are involved such as photo - ionization , photo - excitation and auger transitions .",
    "we have examined the aes and the ionic yields in the case where an inner - shell photoionization takes place followed by an auger decay of the singly charged hole - system . we have demonstrated the emergence of ac - stark splitting of the auger resonance , resulting from strong rabi - couplings .",
    "in addition , ionization yields have been calculated for a range of intensities .",
    "we show how to control the branching ratios of various ionic species by varying dynamical parameters of the system , such as rabi coupling and detunings .",
    "the theory was applied to the case of k - shell ionization of neon with the photon frequency chosen to match the energy differences between ionic ne@xmath0 ground and excited states .    in the present study , we have put aside the issue of a field undergoing fluctuations suitable for the description of more realistic situations . a more realistic approach is to assume a field with an amplitude undergoing random fluctuations @xcite . in general , the fluctuations of the field give rise to a nonzero bandwidth ( beyond the fourier bandwidth ) and intensity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the main differences are that the field will excite a number of ( nearby ) excited states ( see for example the most important ones in the table 1 ) , basically those that lie within the x - ray field bandwidth and that the width of the auger spectrum will be effectively increased with the x - ray bandwidth .",
    "the development of the appropriate theory , capable to describe the field fluctuations , requires a detailed formulation which is beyond the purposes of the present study and it will be the subject of a future work .",
    "the essential outcome of the present work , namely the emergence of the ac - stark splitting in the auger spectra under the presence of strong ionic rabi - couplings , will remain and the stochastic nature of the field will mainly affect its observability .    finally , keeping the focus on the essence of the issue of experimental observability , we refrain from showing the influence of the volume integration in the final results , but its precise contribution needs to be evaluated when it comes to the actual experimental conditions .",
