    "this emission probably originates from ambient molecular hydrogen gas in this region , which corresponds to the presence of far - uv radiation by producing a pdr @xcite .",
    "however , taking account of the h@xmath2 lines ratios ( table [ tbl : h2ratio ] ) , we should not rule out the excitation by shock as the emission source .",

    "the weak h@xmath2 and strong [ ] emission at high - velocity ( v@xmath5 @xmath8 @xmath1120 km  s@xmath7 ) show good agreement in position and velocity , indicating that the [ ] emission lines usually arise from bow apex , where the jet velocity is faster than surrounding region @xcite .",
    "the velocity difference of @xmath8 100 km  s@xmath7 between the high- and low - velocity peaks in the h@xmath2 lines is similar to that observed in the jet of l1551-irs 5 @xcite , which has an inclination angle of @xmath8 45@xmath13 with respect to the line of sight . in knot b at sp 1 , we see three discrete velocity peaks in h@xmath2 where the velocity of the peak increases with increasing @xmath25y@xmath25 .",

    "the total offset along the outflow is @xmath8115 , after consideration of the different angle between our slit ( 256@xmath13 ) and the outflow axis ( 227@xmath13 ) .",
    "one possible interpretation for this position shift is a spatial difference between the faster gas in the bow apex and the slower portion in the bow wing .",
    "we can not rule out , however , the possibility that this shift is caused by distinct knots originally located in different positions .",
    "in contrast to the blueshifted gas seen at all slit positions , the redshifted component ( v@xmath5 @xmath31 @xmath110.2 km  s@xmath7 ) seen in h@xmath2 at sp 2 and 3 seems to arise from another , spatially unresolved outflow . since the slit positions are pointing at the blue lobe of the jet ( see section [ sec : intro ] and [ sec : observation ] ) , at locations where the blueshifted material is well - separated in phase space from any ambient emission , the detection of redshifted emission implies the existence of a distinct outflow , separated from the high - velocity blueshifted jet . this outflow may have an axis almost parallel to the plane of the sky , with a wide outflow opening angle , because it shows both blue and redshifted components at low - velocity ( @xmath150 km  s@xmath7 @xmath21 v@xmath5 @xmath21 @xmath3250 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "for a further discussion , we need additional clues on the position and orientation of the redshifted component , which would need to come from further observations with high spectral resolution and with higher spatial resolution than we can obtain with our present instrument / telescope combination .      as shown in section [ sec : intro ] and figure [ fig : sourcemap ] , the lkh@xmath0 234 region is complicated with several outflow sources observed at mid - ir , millimeter , and radio wavelengths . in this section ,",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : sourcemap ] , its position agrees well with the `` green blob '' feature seen in the center of the c - shaped reflection nebula in the jhk color image of @xcite , a feature that is probably caused by [ ] emission in the h@xmath1band .",
    "the narrow band [ ] @xmath31.644 @xmath4 image in @xcite , which showed emission at the same position , supports this conclusion .",

    "the mid - ir source irs 6 lies in the cavity with a @xmath8 05 offset from vla 3b .",

    "is very similar to that of the h@xmath2 jet ( 227@xmath13 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : sourcemap ] .",
