    "two outstanding questions of importance that the lhc should shed light on are the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and the relationship of the mechanism of ewsb to new states beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "there is strong indirect evidence for the ewsb sector being described by a theory that includes a particle that ( at least ) approximately has the properties of the sm higgs boson .",
    "this evidence follows from many observables in flavour physics , from electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) , lep , the tevatron and now the lhc .",
    "the sm higgs is consistent with the results of these experimental probes in its pattern of breaking custodial symmetry ( @xmath4 ) @xcite as well as in the manner by which it sources the experimentally established pattern of flavour violation . in light of these results ,",
    "there is substantial indirect evidence that a scalar field involved in ewsb will also be sm higgs like in that the soft higgs theorems of refs",
    ".  @xcite will be approximately respected , i.e. the scalar field will couple to the sm fields with a strength that is proportional to the mass of the corresponding sm particle .",
    "directly , lep , the tevatron and lhc have jointly excluded large regions of possible higgs masses in the sm .",
    "the upper bound ( in the low mass region ) for the sm higgs is now restricted to @xmath5 by atlas @xcite and @xmath6 by cms @xcite at @xmath7 cl , with a suggestive clustering of possible signal events around @xmath1 . however , in spite of these results , the higgs hypothesis is not yet established . in particular , there remains a significant freedom in the allowed couplings of a scalar effective field to the sm gauge bosons and fermions - so long as such a resonance has the approximate symmetries and properties discussed above @xcite .",
    "such deviations in the properties of a scalar field from the sm higgs can be interpreted as following from the higgs boson emerging from a strongly interacting sector as a pseudo - goldstone boson , or as the leading effect in the effective theory of more massive states that are integrated out .    in light of this experimental situation ,",
    "attempting to use current ( and future ) higgs signal strength parameters to establish relationships between the ewsb sector and beyond the sm states is speculative .",
    "this is certainly the current status , as the suggestive clustering of signal excesses at @xmath1 has not risen to the level of experimental evidence for a scalar resonance .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we will assume that future data will support the discovery of a scalar resonance at approximately this mass scale .",
    "further , we will consider current signal strength measurements as indicative of the properties that such a scalar resonance has when performing global fits .",
    "in anticipation of such a discovery , it is of interest to consider how to efficiently extract evidence of yet other states coupled to such a scalar field .",
    "the gauge invariant mass operator of the scalar degrees of freedom , being of dimension two , is expected to couple generally to all degrees of freedom .",
    "it is difficult to forbid a coupling of this operator at the renormalizable ( or non - renormalizable ) level to new states .",
    "as such , the measurement of the decay width of a new scalar resonance to states that do not directly lead to significant excesses in the higgs discovery channels , defined in this paper as its invisible branching ratio @xmath0 , could be the first direct measurement of interactions with states beyond the sm .",
    "this exciting possibility has lead to many studies on extracting the invisible width of the higgs . in this paper",
    "we will explore a very straightforward route using current and future experimental results on higgs properties , expressed in terms of signal strength data , to probe for evidence of a @xmath0 .",
    "we first show ( in section [ smhiggs1 ] ) that the current experimental hints of a new scalar resonance at @xmath1 do not put strong constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "we then explore in detail how to extract evidence for ( or exclude ) a @xmath0 using global combinations of best fit signal strength parameters , performing global @xmath8 fits , and demonstrating a global probability density function ( pdf ) approach that can be used to explore and optimize searches for @xmath0 in certain scenarios of beyond the sm ( bsm ) physics ( section [ pdftest ] ) . in section [ pdftest2 ]",
    ", we examine the related issue of the precision with which @xmath0 is expected to be known in these scenarios when errors are small enough for a resonance discovery to be claimed .",
    "these promising results raise the question of the robustness of such a global approach .",
    "these techniques are most promising when bsm physics couples to the sm primarily through the ` higgs portal ' @xcite , i.e. they are optimal in bsm scenarios where new states are not charged under the sm gauge group and couple to the sm ( initially ) through the sm gauge singlet scalar mass operator .",
    "this is the case we explore in detail throughout section [ smhiggs1 ] .",
    "we briefly discuss and summarize the prospects for global fits to uncover @xmath0 in broader scenarios in section [ global ] where the effective couplings of the higgs to the sm fields deviate from their sm values due to the higgs being a pseudo - goldstone boson or due to the presence of higher dimensional operators .",
    "we present detailed numerics for these scenarios ( based on current global higgs fits to experimentally reported signal strengths ) throughout the remainder of section [ global ] .",
    "we find that global fits to signal strength parameters will be a powerful approach to search for evidence of @xmath0 in the scenarios we consider .",
    "but we note that challenges will exist in disentangling other new physics effects .",
    "this will likely require a combination of indirect global fit approaches to extracting @xmath0 , which is the focus of this paper , and more traditional direct searches for @xmath0 based on kinematic properties of higgs signal channels .",
    "we compare and contrast these approaches in section [ direct ] and then discuss our overall conclusion in section [ concl ] .",
    "in this section , we will present the current global best fit used are reported in the appendix for completeness .",
    "note that throughout this paper we will assume a @xmath10 contamination due to @xmath11 events in the @xmath12 signal strength , see the appendix for further details . ] results for @xmath13 for the sm higgs , where @xmath14 is the decay width to ` invisible ' states , as defined above , and @xmath15 is the decay width of the sm higgs .",
    "we perform a global fit to the available higgs signal data , fitting to fifteen higgs signal strength parameters @xmath16 reported by atlas , cms and the tevatron collaborations which are defined as _",
    "i =  , for a production of a higgs that decays into the visible channel @xmath17 .",

    "the label @xmath19 in the cross section , @xmath20 , is to denote that signal events in some final states are defined ( by selection cuts ) to only be summed over a subset of higgs production processes @xmath19 .",
    "we construct a global @xmath8 measure on the @xmath21 by defining the matrix @xmath22 as the covariance matrix of the observables , and @xmath23 as a vector of the difference between the signal strength variable @xmath16 and the best fit value of the signal strengths , in terms of the observed number of events ( @xmath24 ) , the number of background events ( @xmath25 ) and the expected number of sm signal events ( @xmath26 ) . ] , [ chi2 ] ^2(_i ) = ( _ m)^t ( ^-1)_mn ( _ n)=_i=1^n_ch",
    ". here @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the number of channels .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 is taken to be diagonal with the square of the @xmath29 theory and experimental errors added in quadrature for each observable , giving the error @xmath30 in the equation above .",
    "correlation coefficients ( currently not supplied by the experimental collaborations ) are neglected .",
    "for the experimental errors we use @xmath31 symmetric @xmath29 errors on the reported @xmath18 . for theory predictions of the @xmath20 and related errors",
    ", we use the numbers given on the webpage of the lhc higgs cross section working group @xcite",
    ". the minimum ( @xmath32 ) is determined , and the @xmath33 best fit confidence level ( cl ) regions are given by @xmath34 , respectively , for @xmath35 . here",
    ", the cl regions are defined by the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) for a one - parameter fit .",
    "although we are fitting for evidence of new ` invisible ' states , we do not include effects due to new unknown interactions on the production of the sm higgs in this section . ] .",
    "we include an invisible width by modifying the sm branching ratios universally for each decay into final states @xmath36 via ( h f ) = ( 1 - br_inv ) _ sm(h f ) . [",
    "eq : brinv ] thus , the effect of including an invisible width ( of bsm origin ) on the signal strengths is that the expected @xmath37 in the sm is modified to an expectation of @xmath38 .",
    "we fit for the parameter @xmath0 assuming a sm higgs with a total sm width @xmath39 and a particular higgs mass .",

    "] an inspection of the data used for @xmath42 ( see the appendix ) reveals @xmath43 ( atlas ) and @xmath44 ( atlas and tevatron ) as the channels that most favor a nonzero value of @xmath0 , while @xmath45 ( atlas ) , @xmath43 ( cms ) and @xmath46 ( tevatron ) are the channels which tend to drive @xmath47 .    ; the blue ( lower ) solid curve is for @xmath42 .",
