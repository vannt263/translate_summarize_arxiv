    "the emerging field of spintronics aims to implement semiconductor devices which utilize both the carrier charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite research in the field has been inspired by the early device proposal of datta and das , @xcite which consists of spin injection through a ferromagnetic - semiconductor interface and spin manipulation using the rashba spin - orbit effect .",
    "@xcite there has been recent progress in achieving maximum spin injection @xcite and in characterization of the rashba effect @xcite .",
    "however , a spin device based on injection has a high tunnel resistance , analogous to a schottky diode .",
    "we have suggested an alternate approach of spin creation and manipulation which makes use of the proximity effects of a ferromagnet on a semiconductor .",
    "@xcite the eventual device would avoid the high tunnelling resistance by keeping the main driven current path entirely in the semiconductor through normal ohmic nonmagnetic leads , resembling the field - effect transistor design .",
    "in this paper we present a comprehensive theory of the consequences of the ferromagnetic proximity on the equilibrium and transport properties of the electrons in the semiconductor .",
    "first , we fully examine the coupling of a semiconductor two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a ferromagnetic layer through a very thin potential barrier .",
    "explicit calculations are provided for two realizable systems , the silicon inversion layer and the naturally - formed inas surface layer , both with ferromagnetic gates .",
    "the coupling is conveniently treated by a green s function method which can account for realistic confinement for the semiconductor 2deg as well as the effects of a short electron mean free path in the ferromagnet .",
    "the complex self - energy of the 2deg due to the interaction with the ferromagnet contains both static and dynamic effects ( a zeeman - like splitting and spin - dependent scattering times , respectively ) .",
    "both properties alter the in - plane conductivity and can be exploited through the spin - dependent transport under the ferromagnetic gate . as an illustration of the possible consequences of the ferromagnetic proximity on the semiconductor , we show in detail the behavior of the density and current in a previously proposed @xcite planar spin - valve in mosfet - style configuration with two adjacent ferromagnetic gates with reversible magnetizations .",
    "we find that the proposed device has a significant magnetoresistance effect for reasonable system parameters .",
    "the coupling of the 2deg to the ferromagnetic gate exponentially decreases with their separation by a potential barrier .",
    "our study includes oxide barriers down to the smallest state - of - the - art thickness and direct contact between the 2deg and the ferromagnet to ensure sizable spin effects .",
    "a consequence of this requirement for ultrathin oxides is that current leakage into the ferromagnetic gate(s ) becomes an integral part of the in - plane electron transport .",
    "this naturally results in the need to consider both the current driven by the in - plane electric field and the diffusion driven by the density gradient , analogous to the bulk case .",
    "@xcite although such leakage effects would decrease the efficiency of normal field - effect transistors , we find that they actually enhance the spin - dependence of the electron transport from the source to the drain .",
    "we argue that the relevance of proximity effects between a semiconductor and a ferromagnet is supported by recent experiments . a series of optical faraday rotation experiments @xcite have shown that unpolarized non - equilibrium electrons in a semiconductor can spontaneously acquire a net spin polarization in the presence of a ferromagnetic interface .",
    "we have interpreted @xcite the observed effect as arising from the spin - dependent reflection of electrons off the ferromagnetic interface .",
    "assuming negligible spin scattering at the interface , the spontaneous spin polarization produced in the semiconductor is indicative of the strength of the coupling across the semiconductor - ferromagnet junction .",
    "in addition , replacing the schottky barrier @xcite with a much thinner oxide will only increase the interaction .",
    "proximity effects between dissimilar materials have been used to describe how the ordered state of one medium induces a similar order in the other medium which is otherwise normal .",
    "the induced order parameter decays away from the interface .",
    "the common examples are the proximity effects between a superconductor and a normal metal ( or a semiconductor 2deg ) and between a ferromagnet and a paramagnetic metal .",
    "the induced ferromagnetic order in a non - magnetic metal is weak and requires the metal to be superparamagnetic , @xcite such as pd or pt . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the proximity effect between a ferromagnet and a semiconductor 2deg .",
    "the 2deg is examined rather than the bulk semiconductor because it has two advantages : ( 1 ) the 2deg is confined near the interface where it is more susceptible to the influence of the exchange - split electrons in the ferromagnet , and ( 2 ) while the induced polarization in the 2deg may be too small for a magnetization measurement , the influence on the spin - polarized transport is the ultimate goal .",
    "moreover , there exists a large amount of knowledge and technology dedicated to the manipulation of semiconductor 2deg s , further increasing the potential for spintronics devices .    in sec .",

    "the two particular systems we will consider have band diagrams as shown in fig . [ band_diagrams ] .",

    "the left side is the ferromagnet , which is modelled as parabolic bands split by the exchange energy @xmath0.@xcite a very thin oxide separates the 2deg from the ferromagnet .",
    "this oxide is necessary in the silicon system because a gate bias is necessary for the creation of the inversion layer . because the surface layer in the inas system forms naturally , no gate bias is necessary and hence intimate contact ( no oxide barrier ) is possible between the inas surface layer and the ferromagnet .",

    "this , along with the exchange - split parabolic band approximation , can not possibly account for all band effects in the ferromagnet .",
    "we wish to show in a transparent way how the spin - dependence in the ferromagnet can influence the 2deg ; more realistic calculations will be necessary for comparison with experiment , but the essential effects we deduce here should remain valid .",
    "in addition , the two spin channels are considered to be completely decoupled and are labelled by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "experimentally , it appears that the spin lifetime in semiconductor heterostructures can persist for long times and over long distances , including through heterostructure interfaces.@xcite we neglect any mixing due to the spin - orbit effect or other spin - flip processes .",
    "the neglect of the rashba spin - orbit interaction @xcite is valid in si and holds less well in the inas surface layer , but sufficiently well without gate voltage . @xcite    in a recent article@xcite we reported the calculation of the coupling between a silicon inversion layer and a ferromagnetic gate in the effective mass approximation using a triangular potential in the semiconductor region .",
    "the simplicity of the potential allowed us to use the wavefunction matching conditions to derive an equation specifying the complex energy of the eigenstate of the coupled system .",
    "strong scattering in the ferromagnet was incorporated by putting a phenomenological damping into the wavefunction in the ferromagnet region .",
    "the triangular potential approximation , although valid in the silicon system for strong inversion,@xcite is not appropriate for the weakly confined 2deg at the inas surface .",
    "for this reason , the inas potential is calculated self - consisently with the surface layer density distribution using the coupled schrodinger and poisson equations .",
    "a green s function method is devoloped to calculate the coupling between the semiconductor 2deg and the ferromagnet which works for both the triangle potential in the silicon system and the self - consistent potential in the inas system .",
    "in addition , the green s function approach is ideal because it allows us to include scattering in a more natural and rigorous manner than in the wave function approach . in brief , the coupled semiconductor 2deg - ferromagnet system is solved in three steps .",

    "the subsystems are solved , yielding the semiconductor eigenstates @xmath21 with energy @xmath22 and the ferromagnet eigenstates @xmath23 with energy @xmath24 .",
    "the finite overlap between the wavefunctions for the two subsystems implies that they are not mutually orthogonal . to ensure proper fermionic anti - commutation relations between the operators in all parts of the system , we orthogonalize the ferromagnetic eigenstates to the discrete 2deg eigenstates , @xmath25 this allows us to write a general state of the system as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fermion operators for the 2deg state @xmath29 and the orthogonalized ferromagnet state @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the only fermion operators that do not anticommute properly are @xmath31 as an approximation we keep only terms that have a single exponentially decaying term in an overlap integral .",

    "<S> a theory of the proximity effects of the exchange splitting in a ferromagnetic metal on a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a semiconductor is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spin - dependent energy and lifetime in the 2deg create a marked spin - splitting in the driven in - plane current . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of the planar transport allows for current leakage into the ferromagnetic layer through the interface , which leads to a competition between drift and diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - dependent in - plane conductivity of the 2deg may be exploited to provide a new paradigm for spintronics devices based on planar devices in a field - effect transistor configuration . </S>",
    "<S> an illustrative example is provided through the transport theory of a proposed spin - valve which consists of a field - effect transistor configuration with two ferromagnetic gates . </S>",
    "<S> results are provided for two experimentally accessible systems : the silicon inversion layer and the naturally - formed inas accumulation layer . </S>"
