    "for almost two decades , the study of nonlinear phenomena occurring in atomic bose - einstein condensates has experienced an enormous increase of interest @xcite .",
    "a prominent example , in the quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting , is the experimental observation of robust matter - wave solitons of the bright @xcite and dark @xcite type , and the study of their properties ( see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite and @xcite for bright and dark solitons , respectively ) .",
    "such coherent nonlinear excitations of becs are also interesting from the viewpoint of potential applications , ranging from coherent matter - wave optics to precision measurements and quantum information processing .",
    "indeed , the formal similarities between nonlinear and matter - wave optics @xcite indicate that coherent matter - waves may in principle be controlled similarly to their optical siblings in optical fibers , waveguides , photonic crystals , and so on @xcite .    in that respect , it is not surprising that there exist many works devoted to the manipulation of matter waves . among various techniques that have been proposed",
    ", an experimentally tractable one refers to engineering the `` environment '' of the matter - wave , by magnetically @xcite or optically @xcite induced feshbach resonances , which makes it possible to control the effective nonlinearity in the condensate .",
    "the application of such a `` feshbach resonance management '' ( frm ) technique @xcite in the temporal domain was used for the realization of matter - wave bright solitons by switching the interatomic interactions from repulsive to attractive @xcite ; it was also proposed as a means to stabilize attractive higher - dimensional becs against collapse @xcite and to create robust quasi-1d matter - wave breathers @xcite . on the other hand , the frm technique in the spatial domain , which gives rise to the so - called `` collisionally inhomogeneous condensates '' @xcite with a spatially modulated nonlinearity , has also been extensively studied .",
    "in particular , novel phenomena and a variety of applications have been proposed in this context , including the adiabatic compression of matter - waves @xcite , bloch oscillations of matter - wave solitons @xcite , atomic soliton emission and atom lasers @xcite , enhancement of transmittivity of matter waves through barriers @xcite , formation of stable condensates exhibiting both attractive and repulsive interatomic interactions @xcite , solitons in combined linear and nolinear potentials @xcite , generation of solitons @xcite and vortex rings @xcite , control of faraday waves @xcite , and many others .",
    "a detailed recent review of such inhomogeneously nonlinear settings , especially in the context of periodic ( i.e. , nonlinear lattice ) variations can be found in  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the scattering of matter - waves in a collisionally inhomogeneous environment .",
    "in particular , we consider a quasi-1d setting ( whereby matter waves are oriented along the @xmath0-direction ) and assume that the scattering length @xmath1 is piecewise constant for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , taking respectively the values @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and changes sign at @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , we assume that the normalized scattering length @xmath7 takes the form : @xmath8 ,   \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the spatial scale over which the transition from the asymptotic values @xmath10 and @xmath11 takes place . for the above setting , and in the framework of the mean - field approximation , we will investigate two different scattering processes ; a description of our considerations and the organization of the paper are as follows .",
    "first , in section ii , we study the incidence of a nearly linear ( gaussian ) wavepacket from the repulsive region ( @xmath12 ) to the attractive region ( @xmath13 ) , and demonstrate the generation of a train of bright solitons . by numerically integrating the pertinent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation",
    ", we determine the number of created solitons as functions of the initial data ( amplitude , width and momentum of the incident wavepacket ) , as well as the difference of the values of the scattering length . in section iii ,",
    "we study the reflectivity of a bright soliton from the scattering length interface ; the soliton is assumed to exist and travel from the attractive region ( @xmath13 ) towards the repulsive region ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we find numerically the reflection coefficient as a function of the soliton momentum and amplitude , and find that it has a step - like dependence on momentum for sufficiently weak solitons .",
    "in the case of total reflection , we use an analytical approximation ( treating the soliton as a particle ) and find the equation of motion for the soliton center .",
    "this equation is used to determine the critical value of momentum below which total reflection occurs , which turns out to depend linearly on the soliton amplitude .",
    "additionally , for extremely weak solitons , employing results from linear quantum mechanics @xcite , we also find a ( different ) linear dependence of the critical momentum on the soliton amplitude .",
    "both analytical estimates , for weak and strong solitons are found to be in very good agreement with the numerical results , with the latter also encompassing a transition region between the two regimes .",
    "finally , section  iv concludes our findings and presents a number of directions for future study .",
    "our considerations start from the following gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which describes a quasi-1d bec oriented along the @xmath0-axis @xcite : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the mean - field order parameter , @xmath16 is the atomic mass , @xmath17 is the transverse confining frequency , and @xmath1 the s - wave scattering length [ @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) corresponds to repulsive ( attractive ) interatomic interactions ] .",
    "considering a situation where proper spatially dependent fields close to feshbach resonances are employed , we assume that the scattering length @xmath1 is piecewise constant for @xmath13 and @xmath12 , taking the form @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the spatial scale over which the transition from the asymptotic value @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 ) to @xmath5 ( for @xmath23 ) takes place .",
    "a strategy for developing a corresponding experimental implementation can be based on the interaction tunability of specific atomic species by applying external magnetic fields .",
    "for example , for cesium the s - wave scattering length @xmath1 changes sign through a zero - crossing at an external field strength of 17 g @xcite .",
    "confining cesium atoms in an elongated trapping potential near the surface of an atom chip @xcite will allow for appropriate local engineering of @xmath1 to form steps of varying widths @xmath9 , where the atom - surface separation sets a scale for achievable minimum step widths .",
    "the trapping potential can be formed optically , possibly also by a suitable combination of optical and magnetic fields , whereby care has to be taken as the magnetic field will influence both the external potential and the scattering length profile @xmath7 ; see e.g. the relevant discussion of  @xcite .    normalizing time and space in eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) , as @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the transverse harmonic oscillator length ) , as well as the density as @xmath27 , we cast eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) into the following dimensionless form : @xmath28 where the function @xmath7 is given by eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) . for our analytical and numerical considerations below",
    ", we will use the values @xmath29 , and @xmath30 corresponding to an abrupt , step - like transition .",
    "it is relevant to point out here that , generally , eq .  ( [ gpe1 ] ) as well as its variants attempting to more adequately capture transverse degrees of freedom ( see the quasi-1d models of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) , suggest that the variations / modulations in transverse trapping strength can be used in a way equivalent to longitudinal variations of the scattering length .",
    "this idea has been used even in a quantitative fashion , e.g. , to explain the phenomenology of the formation of faraday wave patterns  cf .",
    "@xcite ( and relevant work in ref .",
    "nevertheless , this type of consideration is not applicable in the present setting , given the sign changing nature of the nonlinearity .",
    "we now assume that a gaussian wavepacket of amplitude @xmath31 and width @xmath32 , initially located at @xmath33 ( i.e. , in the repulsive region ) , moves towards the attractive region .",
    "the specific form of the wavepacket , which is used as an initial condition for eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) in our simulations , is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the initial momentum of the wavepacket .",
    "notice that this form of the wavepacket approximates the ground state profile in the case of relatively small atom numbers ( corresponding to a weak nonlinearity ) .     and",

    ", we show the subsequent dynamics : it is observed that the wavepacket is transmitted through the discontinuity of the scattering length at @xmath42 and , after entering the region with attractive interactions , it transforms into a train of bright solitons .",
    "notice that the soliton generation process is such that each generated soliton is larger than the one that will be generated at a later time .",
    "this is due to the fact that once a portion of the condensate enters the attractive side and is self - organized into a soliton , the number of atoms of the wavepacket on the repulsive side is decreased and , thus , a smaller soliton will be generated next .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the ratio of the velocities of two adjacent solitons in the train is constant ; as a result , for each certain time instance , the distance between adjacent solitons is the same . note that the results on the generation  and characteristics  of the atomic soliton train described above are reminiscent to the ones found in ref",
    ".  @xcite , but by means of a somewhat different physical mechanism : in that work , the soliton train was produced via a sufficiently deep spatially - dependent nonlinearity which acted on a trapped gaussian wavepacket ( existing between a region of vanishing and that of negative scattering length ) .",
    "the depth of the ( abrupt ) negative step was found to control the number of emitted solitary waves .",
    "we find that the number of the created solitons , @xmath43 , depends on the momentum @xmath35 , the amplitude @xmath31 and the width @xmath32 of the gaussian wavepacket , as well as the height of the interface @xmath44 .",
    "results pertaining to the count of the soliton number are shown in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] : larger initial amplitudes and/or widths of the wavepacket result in a larger number of solitons . on the other hand , increasing the initial momentum @xmath45 and/or the height @xmath44 of the interface the number of solitons seems to have a weaker effect on the process ; for the particular example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the number of solitons is @xmath46 at time @xmath36 . here , we should note that for the counting of the number of solitons , we have included only solitons of amplitudes at least @xmath47 of the first created soliton .",

    "next , we consider the reflectivity of a bright soliton at the scattering length interface . we assume , in particular , that a bright soliton moves from the attractive ( @xmath13 ) to the repulsive region ( @xmath12 ) and is , thus , scattered at the interface , at @xmath6 , caused by the change of the sign of the nonlinearity .",
    "this dynamical scenario is , effectively , complementary to the one studied in section  ii .    , scattered at the interface between the attractive and repulsive region , at @xmath6 [ depicted by the dashed ( white ) line ] . from top to bottom , the amplitude of the soliton is @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "the soliton reflectivity can be calculated numerically upon determining the reflection coefficient @xmath59 , defined as the number of atoms remaining in the @xmath13 ( attractive ) region over the number of atoms of the incident soliton .",
    "taking into regard that the latter is given by @xmath60 , we can express @xmath59 as : @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is a time sufficiently large such that the reflected and transmitted parts of the soliton are spatially well separated ; this separation is set by a spatial region of extent @xmath63 around @xmath6 and , accordingly , @xmath62 is appropriately chosen for each individual numerical experiment .",
    "figure  [ rk ] shows the reflection coefficient as a function of the initial soliton momentum ( for @xmath64 ) and various values of the soliton amplitude @xmath54 .",
    "we observe that when @xmath54 is increased , the respective reflection coefficient curves drift towards larger momentum values and the curves become smoother : the transition from total reflection to total transmission becomes less sharp .",
    "this means that the interval of momenta for which partial transmission and reflection occur ( as in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ cont_r ] ) increases with increasing soliton amplitude . from the above discussion",
    ", it is obvious that the soliton keeps its particle - like character only in the case where it is totally reflected ( cf .",

    "thus , according to this particle picture , the soliton will be totally reflected if its initial energy @xmath79 is less than the `` height '' of the barrier .",
    "since the soliton is expected to interact with the effective potential only through its exponential leading tail , the soliton center is anticipated to never reach the interface at @xmath6 , but it will approach it only up to a distance roughly equal to the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the soliton ; the above situation is schematically illustrated in fig .",

    "<S> we study scattering of quasi one - dimensional matter - waves at an interface of two spatial domains , one with repulsive and one with attractive interatomic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the incidence of a gaussian wavepacket from the repulsive to the attractive region gives rise to generation of a soliton train . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the number of emergent solitons can be controlled e.g. by the variation of the amplitude or the width of the incoming wavepacket . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study the reflectivity of a soliton incident from the attractive region to the repulsive one . </S>",
    "<S> we find the reflection coefficient numerically and employ analytical methods , that treat the soliton as a particle ( for moderate and large amplitudes ) or a quasi - linear wavepacket ( for small amplitudes ) , to determine the critical soliton momentum  as function of the soliton amplitude  for which total reflection is observed . </S>"
