    "until recent times , modeling of large - scale , real - world networks was primarily limited in scope to the theory of _ random networks _ made popular by  @xcite . in the erds - rnyi model , for instance ,",
    "a network of @xmath0 nodes is generated by connecting each pair of nodes with a specified probability .",
    "the _ degree distribution _ @xmath1 of a large - scale random network is described by a binomial distribution , where the _ degree _ @xmath2 of a node denotes the number of undirected edges incident upon it .",
    "thus , degree in a random network has a strong central tendency and is subject to exponential decay so that the average degree of a network is representative of the degree of a typical node .    over the past decade , though , numerous empirical studies of _ complex networks _ , as they are known , have established that in many such systems  networks arising from real - world phenomena as diverse in origin as man - made networks like the world wide web , to naturally occurring ones like protein - protein interaction networks , to citation networks in the scientific literature ; see  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively  the majority of nodes have only a few edges , while some nodes , often called _ hubs _ , are highly connected .",
    "this characteristic can not be explained by the theory of random networks . instead , many complex networks exhibit a degree distribution that closely follows a _ power - law _ @xmath3 over a large range of @xmath2 , with an exponent @xmath4 typically between 2 and 3 .",
    "a network that is described by a power - law is called _ scale - free _ , and this property is thought to be fundamental to the organization of many complex systems ;  @xcite .    as preliminary experimental evidence mounted ( see @xcite , for instance ) ,",
    "a simple , theoretical explanation accounting for the universality of power - laws soon followed ; the network model of  @xcite ( ba ) provided a fundamental understanding of the development of a wide variety of complex networks on an abstract level .",
    "beginning with a connected seed network of @xmath5 nodes , the ba algorithm generates a network using two basic mechanisms : _ growth _ , where over a series of iterations @xmath6 the network is augmented by a single node together with @xmath7 undirected incident edges ; and _ preferential attachment _ where the new edges are connected with exactly @xmath8 nodes already in the network such that the probability a node of degree @xmath2 gets an edge is proportional to @xmath9 , the degree of the node .",
    "when @xmath8 is fixed throughout , @xcite showed rigorously that the ba model follows a power - law with exponent @xmath10 in the limit of large @xmath11 .",
    "the sudden appearance of the ba model in the literature , nearly a decade ago , sparked a flurry of research in the field , and , consequently , numerous variations and generalizations upon this prototypal model have been proposed ;  @xcite and  @xcite rank as the preeminent survey papers on the subject .    in this paper , we propose a new _ growing model _",
    "based on preferential attachment : the poisson growth ( pg ) model .",
    "our model , as described in section  [ sec : pg model ] , is an extension of the ba model in two regards .",
    "firstly , we consider the number of edges added at a step to be a random quantity ; at each step , we assign a value to @xmath8 according to a poisson distribution with expectation @xmath12 . secondly , we avail ourselves of a more general class of preferential attachment functions @xmath13 studied by several authors including  @xcite and  @xcite . in section  [ sec : degree distribution ]",
    "we argue that the degree distribution of the pg model follows a power - law with exponent @xmath4 that can be tuned to any value greater than 2 ; the technical details of our argument are left for the appendix .",
    "in addition , we conducted a simulation study to support our theoretical claims .",
    "our results , provided in section  [ sec : simulation ] , show that the values of @xmath4 we estimated from networks generate under the pg model are in agreement with those predicted by our formulae for the power - law exponent .",
    "our motivation for proposing the pg model , as explained in section  [ sec : discussion ] , arises from a need for a simple , yet realistic model that is serviceable in applications .",
    "in fact , with our model every network has a nonzero probability of being generated , in addition to possessing a tunable power - law exponent .",
    "in contrast , the ba model has a fixed @xmath4 , and is subject to numerous structural constraints which severely limit the variety of generable networks .",
    "we give a simple formula for the probability of a network under the pg model , which can be applied quite naturally in bayesian inference using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods .",
    "firstly , given a network @xmath14 , we may estimate the pg model parameters , or engage in model selection in the case when we have more models ; or , going against the grain , we may estimate an unknown @xmath14 from data using our pg model formula as a scale - free prior distribution .",
    "finally , other scale - free models have been put forth in the literature , besides our new model , that are realistic enough for use in applications .",
    "an extension of ba model by  @xcite incorporates `` local events , '' which allows for modifications , such as rewiring of existing edges , to the network at each step .",
    "other authors , including  @xcite , proposed a class of growing models based on node duplication and edge rewiring .",
    "other scale - free model not based on growth have also been proposed ; for example , the static model of  @xcite . among these models ,",
    "the pg model is the simplest preferential attachment model sufficiently realistic for use in applications .",
    "in the pg model , we begin with a small seed network of @xmath5 nodes .",
    "let @xmath15 be the network at the onset of time step @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a set of @xmath11 nodes and @xmath18 is a multiset of undirected edges so that multiple edges between nodes , but no loops , are permitted .",
    "the updated network @xmath19 is generated from @xmath20 as follows :    _ poisson growth _ : : :    a new node @xmath21 is added to the network together with    @xmath22 incident edges ; @xmath22 is a random    variable assigned according to a poisson distribution with expectation    @xmath12 . _",
    "preferential attachment _ : : :    each edge emanating from @xmath21 is connected with a    node already in the network .",
    "node selection can be considered as a    series of @xmath22 independent trials , where at each trial    the probability of selecting a node from @xmath23 with degree    @xmath2 is    @xmath24 where    @xmath25 is the degree of node @xmath26 at step    @xmath11 .",
    "define @xmath27 as the number of times    node @xmath26 is chosen at step @xmath11 .",
    "then the    entire selection procedure is equivalent to drawing a vector    @xmath28 from a multinomial    distribution with probabilities @xmath29 ,  ,    @xmath30 and sample size @xmath22 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath27 has poisson distribution with    expectation @xmath31 independently for    @xmath32 .",
    "the pg model is determined by the choice of @xmath13 ; we concentrate on two specifications and discuss their implications in the next section .",
    "firstly , let @xmath33 where the offset @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "more generally , we define @xmath35 by taking @xmath36 with extended domain , but in doing so define a threshold parameter @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , the latter formulation includes the former as a special case when we restrict @xmath38 , so that overall our model is specified by the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the ba model can be explained as a reduction of our model by taking @xmath40 , and by fixing @xmath41 so that the number of edges added to the system at each step is a constant ; the new edges are preferentially attached from the new node to _ exactly _",
    "@xmath8 other nodes .",
    "many structural constrains are implicit in the ba model . indeed , at step @xmath11 , a network with @xmath11 nodes must have @xmath42 edges , none of which are multiple , whereas the number of edges for the pg model can take other values .",
    "a number of extensions of the ba model based upon generalizing @xmath13 have been proposed . in particular",
    ", @xcite analyzed a version where the preferential attachment function is not linear in the degree @xmath2 of a node , but instead can be a power of the degree @xmath43 .",
    "they showed that for the scale - free property to hold , @xmath13 must be asymptotically linear in @xmath2 . in a subsequent work , @xcite and",
    "@xcite independently went on to establish that adding the offset @xmath44 as in  ( [ eq : rk1 ] ) does not violate this requirement , and derived the power - law exponent @xmath45 .",
    "their result is analogous with our reported power - law exponent in  ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) with @xmath46 as seen in the next section .",
    "furthermore , @xcite investigated an attachment function similar to  ( [ eq : rk2 ] ) defined by @xmath47 .",
    "as they took @xmath48 they did not need to be concerned with nodes of degree @xmath49 .",
    "the power - law exponent they derived in this case is reminiscent of our result in  ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the degree distribution @xmath1 for networks generated under the pg model .",
    "the main result is that the degree distribution follows a power - law @xmath50 where @xmath51 indicates these two sequences are proportional to each other so that @xmath52 converges to a nonzero constant as @xmath53 .",
    "this result is an immediate consequence of the recursive formula @xmath54 for sufficiently large @xmath2 , and thus @xmath55 .",
    "the power - law exponent is @xmath56 for the preferential attachment function defined in  ( [ eq : rk2 ] ) , and the exponent takes the range @xmath57 ; the lower limit @xmath58 can be attained by letting @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "this lower limit is in fact the limit for any form of @xmath13 when @xmath62 does not depend on @xmath11 ; @xmath4 must be larger than 2 to ensure the mean degree @xmath63 converges .",
    "for the special case  ( [ eq : rk1 ] ) , the exponent becomes @xmath64 and the range is @xmath65 .    to make the argument precise",
    ", we have to note that @xmath20 is generated randomly and the degree distribution of @xmath20 also varies . let @xmath66 be the number of nodes in @xmath20 with degree @xmath2 . since @xmath67",
    ", the observed degree distribution of @xmath20 is defined by @xmath68 for @xmath69 . for sufficiently large @xmath11 , @xmath70 may follow the power - law of ( [ eq : pklaw ] ) as seen below .",
    "we consider a moderately large @xmath2 for the asymptotic argument as @xmath71 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath2 for consideration is @xmath72 for a given @xmath11 with a constant @xmath73 with any @xmath74 .",
    "then , the expectation of @xmath70 can be expressed as @xmath75 which is the power - law we would like to show for @xmath70 .",
    "the variance of @xmath70 will be shown as @xmath76 indicating the variance reduces by the factor @xmath77 .",
    "note that ( [ eq : vptk ] ) is not a tight upper bound , and the variance can be much smaller .",
    "see the appendix for the proof of ( [ eq : eptk ] ) and ( [ eq : vptk ] ) .",
    "let @xmath78 , and consider @xmath79 , which is even smaller than @xmath80 .",
    "then , @xmath81 with @xmath82 , and thus the limiting distribution @xmath83 follows the power - law of ( [ eq : pklaw ] ) . by taking @xmath84 , the power - law of @xmath70",
    "is shown up to @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "it remains to give an expression for @xmath87 in ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) .",
    "we will show in the appendix that @xmath87 is a solution of the quadratic equation @xmath88 for @xmath89 , one of the solutions @xmath90   \\label{eq : pzero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the unique stable solution with @xmath91 ; this can be checked by looking at the sign of @xmath92 in the neighborhood of @xmath87 .",
    "a small simulation study was conducted to support our theoretical claims of section  [ sec : degree distribution ] .",
    "specifically , we wish to confirm via simulation that the degree distribution @xmath1 of  ( [ eq : pklaw ] ) as well as its expected value @xmath93 as in  ( [ eq : eptk ] ) follow a power - law with @xmath4 as in  ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) . to that end",
    "we generated networks under the pg model for a variety of parameter settings .",
    "for each specification of @xmath94 we generated @xmath95 networks of size @xmath96 , each from a seed network of a pair of connected nodes .",
    "we included the ba model , generated under analogous conditions , so as to demonstrate the soundness of our results which are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .    in point of fact",
    ", estimating @xmath4 from a network can be quite tricky and it has been the subject of some attention in the literature ; see  @xcite .",
    "we sided with the maximum likelihood ( ml ) approach described by  @xcite . in this methodology , the ml estimate of @xmath4 for a particular network is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of nodes with degree @xmath2 , and @xmath99 is the minimum degree after which the power - law behavior holds .",
    "@xcite studied selecting a value for @xmath99 by using a @xmath100 goodness of fit test over a range of @xmath99 ; however , we shied away from this level of scrutiny as we found that taking @xmath101 was reasonable for our examples .",
    "this methodology is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pk ] ( a ) and ( b ) where we plot the degree distribution with @xmath102 for a typical network generated by the ba and pg model , respectively .",
    "returning to table  [ tab:1 ] , in each case , we confirm ( [ eq : pklaw ] ) has power - law exponent as predicted by  ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) and ( [ eq : pzero ] ) .",
    "we computed @xmath103 for each network , and calculated the mean and standard deviation of @xmath102 values for @xmath104 networks .",
    "we observe that the mean @xmath102 agrees well with the predicted @xmath4 , and the variation of @xmath102 is relatively small as suggested by ( [ eq : pkvariation ] ) .",
    "in addition , to show that the same holds for  ( [ eq : eptk ] ) , in each case we computed the average degree distribution of the @xmath104 networks as an estimate of @xmath105 . then we estimated the degree exponent @xmath106 as seen in the table and figure  [ fig : epk ] . again , the simulated results match well with theory .",
    "the pg model has a special place in the class of preferential attachment models .",
    "it has a tunable power - law exponent and a simple implementation , yet it can generate any network .",
    "in contrast , the ba model and its generalizations described in section  [ sec : pg model ] have serious restrictions on the types of networks that can be generated because @xmath8 is held constant .",
    "for example , at step @xmath11 an instantiation of the ba model will consist of a @xmath11 node network with the number of edges equal to exactly @xmath107 , plus the number of edges in the seed network .",
    "the simple design of our model makes computing the probability of a network straightforward .",
    "this in combination with its modeling potential gives rise to several useful applications in bayesian inference .",
    "in explicit terms , let @xmath108 be a network with @xmath109 nodes where @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath111 be a network generated under pg model after step @xmath112 so that @xmath113 , where the seed network consists of a single node . the association between @xmath114 and @xmath115 is defined by a permutation @xmath116 so that @xmath117 . given @xmath14 ,",
    "once we specify @xmath118 , then it is straightforward to compute @xmath25 , @xmath27 for @xmath32 ; @xmath119 .",
    "then the probability of @xmath14 given @xmath39 and @xmath118 is @xmath120    one application is when @xmath14 is known and we wish to estimate @xmath94 .",
    "this can be done by assigning a prior @xmath121 for @xmath94 and the uniform prior on @xmath118 .",
    "the posterior probability of @xmath122 given @xmath14 is @xmath123 using mcmc to produce a chain of values for @xmath122 , the posterior @xmath124 is simply obtained from the histogram of @xmath94 in the chain . moreover ,",
    "this procedure can be used for model comparison , if we have several models for generating the network .",
    "another application is when we wish to make inference about @xmath14 from data @xmath125 with likelihood function @xmath126 .",
    "the posterior probability of @xmath127 given @xmath125 is @xmath128 then the posterior @xmath129 is simply obtained from the frequency of @xmath14 in the chain .",
    "indeed , we used this approach for inferring a gene network from microarray data in  @xcite .",
    "recall that the pg model produces networks with multiple edges . in practice , we often want to restrict our interest to networks without multiple edges . as an approximation , we could apply the formula for @xmath130 just as well in this case .",
    "alternatively , we propose a slight modification to our model where we generate @xmath22 edges at step @xmath11 according to a binomial distribution with parameter @xmath131 and sample size @xmath11 . in this formulation",
    "the seed network must be selected such that @xmath132 , otherwise @xmath133 may occur . then by sampling nodes without replacement , multiple edges are avoided . in our simulation (",
    "results not included ) we found that these modifications do not change the power - law .    finally ,",
    "though we made specific choices for @xmath13 in our arguments , the pg model can be generalized to a wider class of preferential attachment functions .",
    "for instance , @xcite investigated _ accelerated growth _",
    "models where @xmath22 increases as the network grows .",
    "it should be possible to incorporate accelerated growth into pg model by gradually increasing the value of @xmath62 over time .",
    "another line of generalizations of the pg model is via the inclusion of local events .",
    "_ the expected value of @xmath70 _",
    "let @xmath134 denote the indicator function of the event @xmath135 , so @xmath136 if @xmath135 is true and @xmath137 if @xmath135 is false .",
    "we use the notation @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the probability , expectation and the variance , and also @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 for those given a condition @xmath135 . by noting @xmath144 the conditional expectation of @xmath145 given",
    "@xmath20 is @xmath146    the last term @xmath147 can be ignored for a large @xmath2 , since it is exponentially small as @xmath2 grows .",
    "we examine the terms in the summation over @xmath148 for @xmath149 as @xmath71 . for a fixed @xmath150 , @xmath151 for a linear preferential attachment model . more specifically , for @xmath152 , @xmath69 , @xmath153 because the mean degree of @xmath20 is @xmath154 and the denominator of @xmath155 is @xmath156 thus the sum in ( [ eq : enk1 ] ) over @xmath157 becomes @xmath158 for @xmath159 , each term is @xmath160 . by noting @xmath161 , the sum over @xmath162 becomes @xmath163 .",
    "next , we take the expectation of ( [ eq : enk1 ] ) with respect to @xmath20 to obtain the unconditional expectation @xmath164 , and replace @xmath165 .",
    "using the results of the previous paragraph , we get @xmath166 with @xmath167 and the @xmath4 of ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) .",
    "let us assume @xmath168 , and remember @xmath169 .",
    "by taking the limit @xmath71 and equating @xmath170 , we get @xmath171 so that , for sufficiently large @xmath11 , @xmath172 also holds for @xmath2 . since @xmath173 for a fixed @xmath2 , the power - law holds for any @xmath2 by induction up to @xmath174 .    for @xmath13 of ( [ eq : rk2 ] )",
    ", the preferential attachment is modified to @xmath175 this changes the the denominator of @xmath155 in ( [ eq : sumrk ] ) to @xmath176 and thus @xmath177 in the updating formula ( [ eq : eptupdate ] ) is replaced with @xmath178 , leading to ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath179 from ( [ eq : vptk ] ) shown in the next section .      here",
    "we give the proof of ( [ eq : vptk ] ) by working on @xmath180 .",
    "although @xmath13 of ( [ eq : rk1 ] ) is again assumed , the argument is basically the same for ( [ eq : rk2 ] ) . by noting the identity @xmath181 we evaluate the two terms on the right hand side .",
    "the conditional variance of @xmath145 given @xmath20 is evaluated rather similarly as the conditional expectation of ( [ eq : enk1 ] ) . by noting @xmath182 , @xmath183 is expressed for @xmath184 as @xmath185 @xmath186 where terms from @xmath187 are ignored for a large @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the first term in ( [ eq : vntidentity ] ) is @xmath188      we substitute these two expressions for those in ( [ eq : vntidentity ] ) .",
    "we will show , by induction , that @xmath190 holds for all @xmath191 with @xmath149 using some constant @xmath135 .",
    "let us assume that ( [ eq : vntkv ] ) holds for @xmath191 and @xmath192 . by taking a sufficiently large @xmath135 , we have @xmath193 implying that ( [ eq : vntkv ] ) also holds for @xmath194 .",
    "on the other hand , for any random variable @xmath195 with its expectation @xmath196 fixed , the largest possible variance @xmath197 is attained if the probability concentrates on the extreme values 0 and @xmath11 . applying this upper bound to @xmath66 with @xmath174 , we obtain @xmath198 , implying that ( [ eq : vntkv ] ) holds for any @xmath191 with @xmath174 .    for induction with respect to @xmath2 , we only have to show @xmath199 for a sufficiently large @xmath2 so that terms from @xmath200 in ( [ eq : vn1 ] ) can be ignored .",
    "@xmath201 is an arbitrary constant depending on @xmath2 .",
    "we start from @xmath49 .",
    "first note that @xmath202 thus @xmath203 , and so @xmath204 on the other hand , @xmath205 is expressed as @xmath206 by substituting these two expressions for those in ( [ eq : vntidentity ] ) , we observe that the increase of the variance , i.e. , @xmath207 is bounded by a constant , and we have @xmath208 .",
    "let us assume ( [ eq : vt2 ] ) holds up to @xmath209 .",
    "then @xmath210 can be expressed quite similarly as ( [ eq : vntupdate ] ) , but @xmath211 includes additional terms from @xmath212 ; @xmath213 and @xmath214 . for @xmath215 , the covariance term @xmath216 , and for @xmath217 with @xmath218 , the covariance term @xmath219 .",
