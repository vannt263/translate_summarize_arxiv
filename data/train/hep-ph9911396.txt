    "the measurement of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite element @xmath0 is currently one of the important goals of @xmath1 physics .",
    "standard model predictions employ the fundamental parameter @xmath0 as input . as the experiments at the @xmath1 factories are starting to take data , a precise determination of @xmath0 is increasingly vital for testing the standard model .",
    "for example , the standard model prediction for the cp - violating asymmetry in @xmath5 decays depends on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "evidence for the cp - violating asymmetry has already been provided by the cdf collaboration @xcite . as the dedicated experiments are expected to achieve much greater precision ,",
    "an increase in the accuracy of @xmath0 is highly desirable in order to test whether the complex phase of the ckm matrix is the only source of cp violation . on the other hand , despite empirical successes , the standard model is definitely not the final theory of particle physics .",
    "there remain many outstanding issues : electroweak symmetry breaking , fermion masses and mixing , cp violation , replication of families , etc .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath0 is also an important link in pursuit of deeper principles to extend the standard model .",
    "@xmath0 can be determined from both inclusive and exclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath1 meson decays .",
    "the precision of the determination is limited by experimental and theoretical difficulties .",
    "charmless semileptonic @xmath1 decays are a rare process .",
    "the main experimental difficulty in observing signals from @xmath6 processes is the very large background due to @xmath7 whose branching fraction is two orders of magnitude larger . on the theoretical side ,",
    "calculations are needed in order to relate the measured quantity to @xmath0 to extract a value from the data .",
    "strong interaction effects complicate the calculations , causing theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties result not just from nonperturbative qcd which is notoriously difficult to calculate , but also from perturbative qcd although in priciple it is calculable in perturbation theory . with the developments in nonperturbative techniques ,",
    "the uncertainty from perturbative qcd due to the truncation of perturbation series in practical calculations can be comparable to that from nonperturbative qcd , indicating that these two sources of uncertainty can be equally important .",
    "two approaches have been developed for a qcd treatment of inclusive decays of heavy hadrons .",
    "one called the heavy quark expansion approach @xcite is based on the operator product expansion .",
    "one called the light - cone approach @xcite is based on the light - cone expansion , using the notion and method of deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering . in both approaches",
    "the heavy quark effective theory @xcite is exploited as a limit of qcd .",
    "there is important distinction between the two approaches .",
    "the former is a short - distance expansion in local operators of increasing dimension , while the latter is a non - local light - cone expansion in matrix elements of increasing twist .",
    "moreover , the heavy quark expansion approach invokes quark - hadron duality , which assumes rates evaluated at the parton level to be equal to observable rates summed over a sufficient number of hadronic channels .",
    "quark - hadron duality can not be exact @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark expansion approach has to use quark kinematics and can not account for the rate due to the extension of phase space from the parton level to the hadron level .",
    "the rate missing @xcite is just a manifestation of duality violation .",
    "in contrast , the light - cone approach does not rely on the assumption of quark - hadron duality .",
    "rates are evaluated in the light - cone approach using physical phase space at the hadron level .",
    "the light - cone approach was criticized in refs .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that that criticism is mistaken .",
    "the validity of the light - cone approach has been tested @xcite experimentally on the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons .",
    "it is important to test theoretical approaches experimentally in various ways .    to overcome the aforementioned difficulties in the determination of @xmath0 , we proposed @xcite a method of extracting @xmath0 from inclusive charmless semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we proposed to measure the lepton pair spectrum , i.e. , the decay distribution of the kinematic variable @xmath8 in the @xmath1-meson rest frame , where @xmath9 is the momentum transfer to the lepton pair and @xmath10 denotes the @xmath1 meson mass .",
    "because most of @xmath3 ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) events have a value of @xmath13 beyond the threshold allowed for @xmath4 decay , @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the @xmath16 meson mass , this kinematic requirement provides a powerful tool for background suppression . if nothing else , the decay distribution of @xmath13 is of direct interest from an experimental standpoint .",
    "the sum rule can then be used to extract @xmath0 from the weighted integral of the measured @xmath13 spectrum .",
    "the sum rule follows from the light - cone expansion for inclusive charmless semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons and @xmath2-flavored quantum number conservation .",
    "the sum rule is thus independent of phenomenological models .",
    "moreover , the sum rule does not receive any perturbative qcd correction .",
    "therefore , this method is not only experimentally very efficient , but theoretically also quite clean , allowing a precise determination of @xmath0 with a minimal overall ( experimental and theoretical ) error .",
    "the sum rule requires measuring the @xmath13 spectrum in inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath1 meson decays , weighted with @xmath17 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to refine the analysis of @xcite .",
    "we calculate the perturbative qcd correction to the @xmath13 spectrum to order @xmath18 .",
    "we investigate in detail how gluon radiation and hadronic bound state effects affect the shape of the @xmath13 spectrum .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the sum rule for inclusive charmless semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons is briefly described .",
    "we discuss how to extract @xmath0 from experiment exploiting the sum rule . in sec .",
    "iii we study the @xmath13 spectrum , including both the leading perturbative and nonperturbative qcd corrections .",

    "v we present our conclusions .",
    "the sum rule for the decay distribution of @xmath13 in inclusive charmless semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons has been derived @xcite from a nonperturbative treatment of qcd based on light - cone expansion .",
    "the large @xmath1 meson mass sets a hard energy scale in the reactions , so that the light - cone expansion is applicable @xcite to inclusive @xmath1 decays that are dominated by light - cone singularities , just as deep inelastic scattering . for inclusive charmless semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons , @xmath19 of phase space has @xmath20 gev@xmath21 .",
    "this dominance of the high-@xmath22 region in the whole phase space @xmath23 renders the light - cone expansion especially reasonable . the theoretical expression for the weighted integral of the distribution of @xmath13 @xmath24 is very clean . in the leading - twist approximation of qcd , it was found @xcite that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the momentum of the decaying @xmath1 meson .",
    "the masses of leptons , the @xmath27 quark and the @xmath28 meson are neglected . because @xmath2-flavored quantum number conservation under strong interactions implies @xmath29 the leading - twist contribution of nonperturbative qcd to the observable @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : leading ] ) is precisely calculable from first principles .",
    "the result is the sum rule @xcite @xmath31    the conserved current @xmath32 is not subjected to renormalization and the corresponding anomalous dimension vanishes thanks to the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "hence we recognize that the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) does not receive any perturbative qcd correction .",
    "it might seem surprising that one is able to calculate @xmath30 so precisely in qcd when the experimentalist measures hadrons , and it is well known that hadrons can not be understood completely within perturbation theory .",
    "there is a physical way to make clear that we really do not need to know anything about how hadrons are formed in order to predict @xmath30 in inclusive @xmath1 decays .",
    "the observable @xmath30 measures something fundamental  namely the @xmath2-flavored quantum number carried by the @xmath1 meson , and is basically determined by the underlying global symmetry of qcd .",
    "it is therefore insensitive to hadronic bound state effects .",
    "a measurement of the observable quantity @xmath30 in inclusive charmless semileptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons will lead to a determination of @xmath0 by use of the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) which contains no additional parameter .",
    "this determination of @xmath0 is free of perturbative qcd uncertainties .",
    "meanwhile , the dominant hadronic uncertainty is avoided .",

    "we explore step by step perturbative and nonperturbative qcd effects on the @xmath13 spectrum .",

    "more precisely , if by direct measurements or theoretical studies the uncertainty in the mean value of the distribution function can be improved from currently @xmath104 to @xmath116 in the future , the resulting uncertainty in the ratio @xmath101 for the extrapolation would decrease from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "a calculation of the @xmath117 perturbative qcd correction to the @xmath13 spectrum is also important for improving the accuracy of the extrapolation .    the physical observable quantity @xmath30 is connected with @xmath0 via the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) for semileptonic @xmath1 decay in the leading - twist approximation of qcd .",
    "the sum rule is a fundamental , model - independent prediction of qcd .",
    "note that the sum rule does not rely on the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "no arbitrary parameter other than @xmath0 enters the sum rule . the dominant hadronic uncertainty is avoided in the sum rule .",
    "as important , there is no perturbative qcd modification of this sum rule , so that the potential source of theoretical uncertainty associated with perturbative qcd calculations is totally averted .",
    "the kinematic cut on @xmath13 , @xmath118 , and the semileptonic @xmath1 decay sum rule , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule ] ) , offer an outstanding opportunity for the precise determination of @xmath0 from the observable @xmath30 .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this method is both exceptionally clean theoretically and very efficient experimentally in background suppression .",
    "there remain two types of theoretical uncertainties in the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "first , higher - twist ( or power suppressed ) corrections to the sum rule cause a theoretical error of order @xmath119 on @xmath0 . a quantitative study of higher - twist effects could further reduce this small theoretical uncertainty associated with simply extracting the value of @xmath0 from the measured value of @xmath30 .",
    "second , the extrapolation of the weighted @xmath13 spectrum to low @xmath13 gives rise to a systematic error for the measurement of @xmath30 .",
    "the status of this additional theoretical uncertainty associated with extrapolation , as well as how to improve it , have been discussed above .",
    "eventually , the error on @xmath0 determined by this method would mainly depend on how well the observable @xmath30 can be measured . to measure @xmath30",
    "experimentally one needs to be able to reconstruct the neutrino .",
    "this poses a challenge to experiment .",
    "given the unique potential of determining @xmath0 , we would urge our experimental colleagues to examine the feasibility of the method .",
