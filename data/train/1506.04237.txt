    "in two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) with rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , when the energy downs below the band crossing point ( bcp ) , a band valley emerges ( fig .",
    "1 ) with different topology of fermi surfaces ( fs ) from that when the energy is above the bcp @xcite . in the band valley",
    "the dispersion curve is not monotonic and the density of state ( dos ) is one - dimensional ( 1d)-like . in the case of strong soc , the fermi level can lie in the vicinity of or even below the bcp , and the valley structure can survive the weak disorder and thermal smearing at low temperatures . therefore , in this case the nontrivial topology of fs in the band valley may affect the transport properties significantly .",
    "the strongly spin - obit coupled 2des , formed at the te - terminated surface in layered polar semiconductors bitex ( x = cl , br , i ) , has been discovered recently by arpes measurements in agreement with ab - initio calculations @xcite . in such 2des",
    "the giant rashba soc coefficient is one order of magnitude higher than that in conventional iii - v semiconductor heterostructures @xcite .",
    "in addition , the bitex quantum well @xcite may be another candidate to realize strongly spin - orbit coupled 2des .",
    "very recently the first - principle band structure calculation has suggested the strain engineering of heavy - metal film on layered large - gap semiconductor substrate @xcite as a promising way to form 2des with strong rashba soc , e.g. , au single layer on strained inse(0001 ) . in aforementioned 2des ,",
    "the large rashba spin - splitting provides a chance to study the unconventional transport properties induced by the band valley and band crossing .",
    "the effects of the band valley and band crossing on spin transport and superconducting electronics have received much theoretical attention , e.g. , the non - dyakonov - perel spin relaxation behavior @xcite , the non - edelstein electric - field induced spin polarization @xcite , the enhanced spin - orbit torque efficiency @xcite , the enhanced superconducting instabilities @xcite and the specular andreev reflection in the interface of a superconductor and a 2des with strong rashba soc @xcite .",
    "in addition , spin - related thermoelectric conversion in systems with strong rashba soc is gathering increasing attention , which is not only essential for exploring spintronics devices @xcite but also important for developments of spin caloritronics @xcite . for rashba 2des , based on the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) @xcite in the semiclassical boltzmann equation ( sbe ) approach , it has been suggested recently that the dimensional reduction of the electronic structure from 2d to 1d can result in enhancements of the diffusive thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merit @xcite @xmath1 .",

    ", the enhancement of thermopower was attributed solely to the 1d - like dos below the bcp @xcite .",
    "however , so far , no fully satisfactory theoretical study on thermoelectric transport exists for the case that @xmath0 lies in the vicinity of or below the band crossing point .",
    "this is because that the rta is inappropriate for rashba 2des at low temperatures when the electron - impurity scattering dominates , in the case of strong soc @xcite . for fermi energies above the bcp",
    ", the rta can not handle the difference in the relative importance between the interband and intraband elastic scatterings .",
    "this difference is significant when @xmath0 lies near the bcp , so the rta is unsuitable for this case .",
    "while for fermi energies below the bcp , the nontrivial fs topology induces not only the 1d - like dos , but also nonconventional intraband scattering @xcite(inter - branch and intra - branch scatterings , the two branches are denoted in fig .",
    "1 ) which is also beyond the scope of rta .",
    "it has been shown that @xcite , when @xmath0 is below the bcp , the nonequilibrium spin polarization calculated by an exact transport time solution of the sbe is quite different from the result obtained by the constant rta @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to employ the exact solution @xcite of the sbe to systematically study the effects of strong rashba soc on the spin - related thermoelectric transport in 2des at low temperatures .    in this paper",
    "the exact solution of the sbe is employed to calculate thermoelectric transport coefficients and the figure of merit in rashba 2des .",
    "this solution is suitable when electron - impurity scatterings dominate .",
    "we show that the electrical conductivity takes a drude form when @xmath0 is above the bcp , but a non - drude form which is a quadratic function of @xmath0 when @xmath0 is below the bcp .",
    "we found that , the @xmath0-dependence of the peltier coefficient is not monotonic and the mott relation @xcite breaks down in the vicinity of the bcp .",
    "it is shown that the thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merit have strong enhancements when @xmath0 is tuned below the bcp .",
    "this enhancement in the thermoelectric performance is a combined result of the 1d - like dos and the unconventional intraband scattering induced by the nontrivial fs topology in the band valley .",

    "<S> thermoelectric transport in strongly spin - orbit coupled two - dimensional rashba system is studied using the exact solution of the linearized boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> some unusual transport behaviors are revealed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the electrical conductivity takes a drude form when the fermi energy @xmath0 is above the band crossing point , but a non - drude form which is a quadratic function of @xmath0 when @xmath0 lies below the band crossing point . </S>",
    "<S> the mott relation breaks down when @xmath0 lies in the vicinity of the band crossing point . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merit are strongly enhanced when @xmath0 downs below the band crossing point . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement is attributed to not only the one - dimensional - like density of state but also the unconventional intraband elastic scattering below the band crossing point . </S>",
