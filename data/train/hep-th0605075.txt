    "in @xmath5 dimensions the kerr - newman solution presents the unique family of stationary asymptotically flat black holes of einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory .",
    "it comprises the kerr solution , representing rotating vacuum black holes , as well as the static reissner - nordstrm and schwarzschild solutions .",
    "the generalization of these black hole solutions to @xmath6 dimensions was pioneered by tangherlini @xcite for static black holes , and by myers and perry @xcite for rotating vacuum black holes .",
    "the corresponding @xmath6 charged rotating black holes of em theory could not yet be obtained in closed form @xcite .",
    "but in @xmath4 dimensions rotating em black holes have been constructed numerically @xcite .",
    "in contrast to pure em theory , exact higher dimensional charged rotating black holes are known in theories with more symmetries .",
    "the presence of a chern - simons ( cs ) term , for instance , leads to a class of odd - dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons ( emcs ) theories , comprising the bosonic sector of minimal @xmath4 supergravity , whose stationary black hole solutions @xcite possess surprising properties @xcite . in particular , emcs black holes ( with horizons of spherical topology ) are no longer uniquely characterized by their global charges @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of additional fields , as required by supersymmetry or string theory , yields further exact solutions @xcite .",
    "stationary black holes in @xmath3 dimensions possess @xmath7 $ ] independent angular momenta @xmath8 associated with @xmath2 orthogonal planes of rotation @xcite .",
    "( @xmath9 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath10 , corresponding to the rank of the rotation group @xmath11 . )",
    "the general black holes solutions then fall into two classes , in even-@xmath3 and odd-@xmath3 solutions @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on charged rotating black holes in odd dimensions .",
    "we show , that when their @xmath2 angular momenta have all equal magnitude , the angular dependence can be treated explicitly for any odd dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting system of coupled einstein and matter field equations then simplifies considerably , yielding a system of @xmath3-dependent ordinary differential equations .",
    "we here solve these equations numerically for einstein - maxwell theory in @xmath4 , 7 and 9 dimensions .    in section 2",
    "we recall the em action , and present the stationary axially symmetric anstze for black hole solutions with @xmath2 equal - magnitude angular momenta in @xmath0 dimensions , @xmath12 .",
    "we discuss the black hole properties in section 3 , and present numerical results for em black holes in section 4 .",
    "we consider the @xmath3-dimensional einstein - maxwell action with lagrangian @xmath13 with curvature scalar @xmath14 , @xmath3-dimensional newton constant @xmath15 , and field strength tensor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the gauge potential .",

    "an adequate parametrization for the gauge potential is given by @xmath34 thus , independent of the odd dimension @xmath35 , this parametrization involves only four functions @xmath36 for the metric and two functions @xmath37 for the gauge field , which all depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath38 .    to obtain asymptotically flat solutions",

    "the estimates of the relative errors of the global charges and the magnetic moment are of order @xmath81 , giving rise to an estimate of the relative error of @xmath72 of order @xmath82 .",
    "let us first address the domain of existence of rotating em black holes with equal - magnitude angular momenta .",
    "we note , that unlike the case of a single non - vanishing angular momentum , where no extremal solutions exist in @xmath83 dimensions @xcite , extremal solutions do exist for odd @xmath3 black holes with equal - magnitude angular momenta .",
    "we exhibit in fig .",
    "1 the scaled angular momentum @xmath84 of the extremal em black holes versus the scaled charge @xmath85 @xcite for @xmath4 , 7 and 9 dimensions .",
    "black holes exist only in the regions bounded by the @xmath86-axis and by the respective curves .",
    "the domain of existence is symmetric with respect to @xmath87 . introducing the scaling factors @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 we observe that the scaled domain of existence becomes almost independent of @xmath3 , as demonstrated in fig .  1 ( right )",
    ". these extremal black holes have vanishing surface gravity , but finite horizon area .",
    "we now turn to non - extremal black holes , and discuss their properties .",
    "we first consider sets of black hole solutions in @xmath4 , 7 and 9 dimensions , obtained by varying the horizon angular velocity @xmath44 , while keeping the isotropic horizon radius @xmath91 and the charge @xmath92 fixed .    in fig .  2 ( left ) we indicate the location of these sets of solutions within the respective domains of existence , by exhibiting their scaled angular momentum @xmath84 versus their scaled charge @xmath85",
    "we exhibit the dependence of the mass @xmath49 of these solutions on the horizon angular velocity @xmath44 in fig .  2 ( right ) and compare with the corresponding @xmath3-dimensional myers - perry solutions , which have @xmath93 .",
    "for each set of solutions we observe two branches , extending up to a maximal value of @xmath44 .",
    "the lower branch emerges from the static solution in the limit @xmath94 , on the upper branch the mass diverges in the limit @xmath95 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath44 depends on the horizon radius @xmath41 , the charge @xmath96 , and the dimension @xmath3 . for a fixed value of the charge , its influence and thus the deviation from the myers - perry solution",
    "decreases with increasing dimension @xmath3 , as expected from the scaling properties of the solutions @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath97 and the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath72 are presented in fig .  3 for the same sets of solutions .",
    "for small values of the charge @xmath96 the gyromagnetic ratio has been obtained perturbatively , with perturbative value @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we observe , that in the limit @xmath95 , i.e. ,  for slow rotation the gyromagnetic ratio also tends to this perturbative value @xmath98 . on the lower branch , which emerges from a static solution",
    ", the gyromagnetic ratio then increases rapidly from its perturbative value . on the upper branch the gyromagnetic ratio tends back to its perturbative value in the limit @xmath95 , or whenever the mass and angular momentum become large so that the perturbative regime for the charge is reached .",
    "we emphasize that the deviation of the gyromagnetic ratio from the perturbative value @xmath98 is a physical effect .",
    "it is not due to numerical inaccuracy , since the error estimate of @xmath82 for @xmath72 is typically several orders of magnitude less than the observed deviation of @xmath72 from the perturbative value @xmath98 .    as seen in fig .  3 , the deviation of the gyromagnetic ratio from its respective perturbative value decreases with increasing dimension @xmath3 for fixed charge . to obtain deviations of comparable size for @xmath72 in higher dimensions ,",
    "one has to increase the value of the charge @xmath96 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  4 , where we compare the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath72 of the previous @xmath4 data set with @xmath92 to the @xmath99 and @xmath100 data sets with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "we also exhibit the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath72 versus the charge @xmath96 , for fixed values of @xmath41 and @xmath44 in fig .",
    "4 . obviously , for small values of @xmath96 the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath72 tends to its respective perturbative value @xcite .",
    "horizon properties of the sets of black hole solutions ( presented above in figs .  2 - 3 )",
    "are illustrated in fig .  5 , where we exhibit their area @xmath62 and their surface gravity @xmath63 .",
    "while the horizon area increases monotonically with increasing mass , the surface gravity tends to zero for large black holes .",
    "we have considered rotating black holes with equal - magnitude angular momenta in einstein - maxwell theory in odd dimensions .",
    "these black holes are asymptotically flat , and they possess a regular horizon of spherical topology .",
    "we have shown that , by employing suitable anstze for the metric and the gauge potential of these black holes , the coupled system of einstein - maxwell equations reduces to a set of five ordinary differential equations , which we have solved numerically .",
    "we have studied the physical properties of these black holes , in particular their global charges and horizon properties .",
    "the numerical solutions satisfy the generalized smarr formula ( [ smarr ] ) with high accuracy . for generic values of",
    "the charge and angular momentum the gyromagnetic ratio of these black holes differs from @xmath98 .",
    "however , in the limit of vanishing electric charge or vanishing angular momentum , the gyromagnetic ratio does tend to the perturbative value @xmath98 @xcite . for a fixed value of the charge , its influence on the space - time decreases with increasing dimension @xmath3 , as expected from the scaling properties of the solutions @xcite .",
    "currently , we are generalizing these results to einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theory , and to einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory .",
    "emcs black holes , in particular , exhibit already a number of surprising properties in five dimensions .",
    "these include non - uniqueness , rotational instability , or counterrotation @xcite .",
    "certainly further surprises are waiting here in higher dimensions .",
