    "in main - chain polymer nematics the connectivity of the polymer chains forces deformations of orientational order to be inextricably linked to their density @xcite . splay deformations necessarily introduce local changes in polymer density , which become progressively more prohibitive as the chain length grows @xcite . in the continuous limit this coupling between the polymer density and the orientational field",
    "is described by an analogue of the  continuity equation \" for the nematic director field @xmath0 @xcite , that formally describes this coupling .",
    "the form of this mesoscopic continuity equation for a specific case was first suggested by de gennes and meyer @xcite and was later shown @xcite to depend on the detailed symmetry properties of the orientational field , i.e. whether it has a polar or quadrupolar nature , describable by a polar vector or a quadrupolar tensor . in these two cases",
    "the continuity equation , which is by necessity a scalar , can be cast into a vectorial @xcite or a tensorial form @xcite , respectively , and is naturally generalized to include also the vectorial / tensorial ordering moduli .",
    "the tensorial continuity equation is recent and has yet to be thoroughly investigated , ramified and implemented .",
    "this paper presents a rather technical but indispensable step towards identifying the implications of the tensorial conservation law and preparing the grounds for detecting them in microscopic numerical simulations of generic main - chain polymer models @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical considerations hinged only upon the vectorial constraint , irrespective of whether the underlying orientational order of the chain tangents was polar or apolar ( quadrupolar ) , or more precisely , since the polar and quadrupolar order do not exclude each other , irrespective of the relative degree of polar and quadrupolar order of the chain tangents @xcite . at the same time , it has been recognized and generally accepted that the polymer chain flexibility and related microscopic chain back - folding ( hairpins ) significantly influence macroscopic properties of nematic polymers as derived within statistical mechanics framework @xcite .    in this study we consider the consequences of microscopic chain integrity , i.e. , the connectivity of monomers into a linear polymer chain , for the quadrupolar ( tensorial ) order parameter of a true polymer nematic which possesses the chain inversion symmetry and should thus obey the tensorial conservation law . it is hypothesized that the tensorial conservation law will eventually prevail upon the vectorial one in the limit when hairpins are abundant , i.e. , when the length scales on which the tensorial constraint is applied are large compared to the persistence length of the semi - flexible main - chain polymer . there is no other restriction in terms of a particular or chemically specific polymeric material .",
    "moreover , since both constraints are inherent geometric / topological consequences of the unimpaired chain connectivity , they apply in principle to any physical realization of such unbreakable linear chains ( e.g. , also to a thread or to an elastic wire @xcite ) with some noise ( quenched , if not thermal ) , described by a mesoscopic order parameter .",
    "our original motivation stems from the realm of biopolymers @xcite described in terms of the nematic director and the density field variables , specifically including the continuum description of ordering , self - condensation , and packing of dna in tight enclosures @xcite .    in particular , the continuity constraints certainly apply also to coarse - grained bead - spring polymer models that are convenient for computational studies @xcite .",
    "while the limit where hairpins are abundant can not be explored in state - of - the - art microscopic simulations , we nevertheless expect that at least significant deviations from the vectorial constraint towards the predictions of the tensorial constraint will not evade detection in the numerical simulation studies that will follow this work .    from this perspective",
    ", the primary goal of this paper is to present and analyze correlation functions of a worm - like main - chain polymer nematic constrained by the tensorial conservation law , and compare them with analogous correlation functions for the case of the vectorial conservation law @xcite .",
    "in particular , our aim is to identify the correlation functions and their features where the differences between the two constraints lead to important , possibly qualitative differences in behavior . with this work we are preparing a theoretical instrumentarium  a consistent , albeit idealized , prerequisite that will support and illuminate subsequent numerical studies , enabling comparisons between the theoretical correlation functions and those extracted from the simulations .",
    "following this task , there exist a couple of essential restrictions that we intentionally adopt :    * long wavelengths ",
    "while it is easier to identify qualitative differences between the two conservation laws at shorter wavelengths , only large lengths scales are relevant for comparison with simulations , as a large number of hairpins is required for manifestation of the tensorial constraint ; this requirement is more severe than the usual limitation pertaining to the comparison of microscopic data with a continuum model * a minimal energy functional  although a description including more terms and couplings ( and therewith more fitting parameters ) would yield more accuracy for a specific system , it would hamper the isolation of the effects of the conservation laws . provided that in the experimental systems ( i.e. ,  numerical experiments \" ) the differences between the effects of the two constraints are expectedly small , one wants to keep the description as clean as possible in the first step * from the theoretical point of view , we are interested in a direct comparison of the new correlation functions calculated in the presence of the tensorial constraint , with the correlation functions for the case of the vectorial constraint , given in refs .",
    "@xcite , again to identify the differences between the effects of the two constraints .",
    "therefore we delimit ourselves to the same energy functional as in those studies .    besides the density and director autocorrelations",
    ", we calculate also the density  director correlation functions in both the tensorial and vectorial case . while in the context of x - ray and light scattering experiments probing the density and director fluctuations , respectively ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , these have been less relevant , nowadays they can be readily extracted from numerical simulations concurrently with the density and director autocorrelations @xcite . the density  director correlation is a signature of a conservation law ( either vectorial or tensorial ) and its amplitude is directly connected with the strength of the constraint , being zero if none of the constraints is present , i.e. , for a standard non - polymeric nematic .",

    "thus , they can be more easily resolved when the constraints are weaker , but in this case their heights are lower .",
    "preliminary investigations show that the simulations are very much in this regime .",
    "we have presented the structure factor , the director autocorrelation , and the density  director correlation functions for a continuum worm - like description of a main - chain polymer nematic , constrained by the tensorial conservation law , all the while making comparisons with analogous correlation functions for the case of the vectorial conservation law .",
    "in general , the correlation functions influenced by the constraints differ substantially from the correlation functions of the non - polymeric case , if the constraints are strong . in practice",
    "this requires long chains .",
    "moreover , for the tensorial constraint to be well distinguishable from the vectorial one , the chain persistence length should be much smaller than the total length of the chain , so that hairpins ( chain backfolding ) are numerous and the polar order is small .    if this is not satisfied , i.e. , if chain backfolding is costly , then the tensorially - constrained configurations are expected to be similar to vectorially - constrained ones .",
    "namely , in contrast to the first order vectorial constraint , the tensorial constraint is second order in spatial derivatives and thus possesses two families of solutions , one of which is expected to reduce to the vectorial constraint if hairpins are forbidden .",
    "this is indeed supported by a special case  the ( rather unphysical ) limit of constant density and perfect order , @xmath239 , for which one can directly relate the splay of the director field to the local density of hairpins ( c.f .",
    "( 39 ) of ref .",
    "this indicates that in the absence of hairpins the splay is expelled , or in general , that we have recovered the vectorial conservation law with hairpins acting as sources , thus being physically equivalent to chain heads and tails .",
    "hence in this and only this limit the tensorial constraint is reduced to the vectorial one .",
    "general aspects of this connection are however not yet thoroughly understood and further investigations are being carried out to gain more insight into the various ramifications of the vectorial and tensorial conservation laws and their interpretation .",
    "it furthermore follows from our mesoscopic free energy functional , eq .",
    "( [ ft_q ] ) , that microscopic chain backfolding is not penalized and therefore contributes to minimize the energy cost of the constrained density and director variations . as a consequence , in our model",
    "the tensorially - constrained configurations with chain backfolding are therefore always different from the vectorially - constrained configurations , which exhibit no chain backfolding by construction . in other words , within our model based on the functionals eqs .",
    "( [ fnem])-([f_t ] ) , we are always in the flexible chain limit .    for rather short chains , i.e. , values of @xmath240 and @xmath241 , the effects of both constraints are less pronounced and consequently it is not easy to distinguish between the vectorial and tensorial constraints within this regime , as can be clearly observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : svect ] , [ fig : stens ] , [ fig : cvect ] , and [ fig : ctens ] in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "qualitatively , the vectorial and tensorial structure factors are very similar in that region of the parameter space and can be distinguished only by a detailed analysis of the functional dependence of @xmath242 as indicated in secs .",
    "[ sec : parallel ] and [ sec : perpendicular ] .",
    "furthermore , in this parameter regime the director autocorrelation of the tensorial case @xmath243 can be hardly distinguished from the non - polymeric @xmath244 .",
    "the difference seems to be more discernible in the vectorial case : the peak of @xmath245 is still elongated along the @xmath172 axis , whereas the peak of non - polymeric @xmath244 is elongated along the @xmath178 axis in the case of the more common elastic anisotropy @xmath246 .    in principle , the most distinct feature setting apart the two types of constraints , that persists also in the regime of weak constraints , is the behavior of the density  director correlation functions at @xmath62 : @xmath247 is finite , whereas @xmath248 vanishes .",
    "the difference here is thus qualitative .",
    "but in order that it would become actually manifest , we must compare a system with polar orientational order without hairpins on one side , with a system with quadrupolar orientational order with abundant hairpins .",
    "the latter case can be rather difficult to achieve , especially in simulations , as it requires large systems .",
    "with limited chain backfolding , however , one presumably can not observe more than smaller or larger deviations from @xmath211 , depending on the abundance of hairpins .",
    "in this case , near @xmath62 the deviations from @xmath211 , which is finite , towards @xmath236 , which is vanishing , could be rather delicate to trace .",
