    "how does the semiclassical picture arise from the fundamental theory of quantum gravity ?",
    "recently it has become increasingly clear that quantum entanglement in holographic  @xcite descriptions plays an important role in the emergence of the classical spacetime of general relativity  .",
    "this raises the possibility that entanglement is indeed the defining property that controls the physics of dynamical spacetimes .    in this letter",
    "we take the view that entanglement in holographic theories _ determines _ gravitational spacetimes at the semiclassical level . rather than proving this statement ,",
    "we adopt it as a guiding principle and explore its consequences .",
    "this principle has profound implications for the structure of the hilbert space of quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , it allows us to obtain a classical spacetime as a superposition of ( an exponentially large number of ) different classical spacetimes .",
    "we show that despite its unconventional nature , this picture admits the standard interpretation of superpositions of well - defined semiclassical spacetimes in the limit that the number of holographic degrees of freedom becomes large .",
    "to illustrate these concepts , we use a putative holographic theory for cosmological spacetimes , in which the effects appear cleanly .",
    "our basic points , however , persist more generally ; in particular , we expect that they apply to a region of the bulk in the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . in the context of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universes , we find an interesting `` russian doll '' structure :  states representing a universe filled with a fluid having an equation of state parameter @xmath0 are obtained as exponentially many ( exponentially rare ) superpositions of those having an equation of state with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .    while completing this work , we received ref .",
    "@xcite by almheiri , dong and swingle which studies how holographic entanglement entropies are related to linear operators in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "their analysis of the thermodynamic limit of the area operators overlaps with ours .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for related discussion .",
    "we begin by describing the holographic framework we work in .",
    "the ads / cft case appears as a special situation of this more general ( albeit more conjectural ) framework .",
    "the covariant entropy bound  @xcite implies that the entropy on a null hypersurface generated by a congruence of light rays terminated by a caustic or singularity is bounded by its largest cross sectional area @xmath3 divided by @xmath4 in planck units .",
    "( the entropy on each side of the largest cross sectional surface is bounded by @xmath5 . )",
    "this suggests that for a fixed gravitational spacetime , the holographic theory lives on a hypersurface  called the holographic screen  on which null hypersurfaces foliating the spacetime have the largest cross sectional areas  @xcite .",
    "the procedure of erecting a holographic screen has a large ambiguity .",
    "a particularly useful choice  @xcite is to adopt an `` observer centric reference frame .",
    "'' let the origin of the reference frame follow a timelike curve @xmath6 which passes through a fixed spacetime point @xmath7 at @xmath8 , and consider the congruence of past - directed light rays emanating from @xmath7 .",
    "assuming the null energy condition , the light rays focus toward the past , and we may identify the apparent horizon , i.e.  the codimension-2 surface on which the expansion of the light rays vanishes , to be an equal - time hypersurface  called a leaf  of a holographic screen . repeating the procedure for all @xmath9 , we obtain a specific holographic screen , with the leaves parameterized by @xmath9 , corresponding to foliating the spacetime region accessible to the observer at @xmath6 .",
    "such a foliation is consonant with complementarity  @xcite which asserts that a complete description of a system refers only to the spacetime region that can be accessed by a single observer .    with this construction",
    ", we can view a quantum state of the holographic theory as living on a leaf of the holographic screen obtained as above .",
    "we can then consider the collection of all possible quantum states on all possible leaves , obtained by considering all timelike curves in all spacetimes .",
    "it is often convenient to consider hilbert space @xmath10 spanned by the states living on the `` same '' leaf @xmath11 .",
    "we can then write the full hilbert space as  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 contains intrinsically quantum gravitational states that do not admit a spacetime interpretation , and we have defined the sum of hilbert spaces by s or @xmath13 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 for different leaves @xmath16 and @xmath17 may not be orthogonal . ]",
    "@xmath18 this formulation is not restricted to descriptions based on fixed semiclassical spacetime backgrounds .",
    "for example , we may consider a state in which macroscopically different universes are superposed .",
    "time evolution of a quantum gravity state occurs within the space of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "recently , bousso and engelhardt have identified two special classes of holographic screens  @xcite :  if a portion of a holographic screen is foliated by marginally anti - trapped ( trapped ) surfaces , then that portion is called a past ( future ) holographic screen .",
    "they proved that the area of leaves @xmath19 monotonically increases ( decreases ) for a past ( future ) holographic screen .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite proved that this area law holds locally . in many regular circumstances , including expanding frw universes , the holographic screen is a past holographic screen , so that the area of the leaves monotonically increases , @xmath20 . in this letter",
    "we focus on this case .",
    "what is the structure of the holographic theory and how can we explore it ?",
    "recently , a conjecture has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite which relates geometries of general spacetimes to the entanglement entropies of states in the holographic theory .",

    "this implies that the normalized area of the extremal surface @xmath23 $ ] @xmath26 = \\frac{1}{4 } \\norm{e[\\gamma ] } , \\label{eq : s_sigma}\\ ] ] satisfies expected properties of entanglement entropy , so that it can be identified with the entanglement entropy of the region @xmath21 in the holographic theory . here",

    "we choose the origin of the reference frame , @xmath6 , to be at @xmath35 .",
    "the holographic theory then lives on the holographic screen at @xmath36 where the dot represents @xmath37 derivative , and @xmath38 is the frw time on a leaf . for flat and open universes ,",
    "the leaves always form a past holographic screen as long as the universe is initially expanding .",

    "realistic universes are obtained , e.g. , by introducing an infinitesimally small amount of additional matter . ]",
    "this shows how a state in the holographic theory encodes the information about the spacetime it represents .",
    "for example , @xmath65 decreases monotonically in @xmath0 for any fixed @xmath66 .",
    "there are simple geometric bounds on @xmath65 .",
    "the maximin construction  @xcite states that the extremal surface is the one having the maximal area among all possible codimension-2 surfaces each of which is anchored on @xmath67 and has minimal area on some interior achronal hypersurface bounded by @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that @xmath65 obeys  @xcite @xmath68 the universes dominated by a @xmath59 component and curvature saturate the upper and lower limits , respectively .",
    "unlike the case of asymptotically ads spacetimes , entanglement entropies in the holographic theory for frw universes obey a volume law .",

    "we assume that this does not affect the analyses below based on @xmath113 unless we probe more than half of them ; the extra degrees of freedom may become relevant if we consider @xmath114 .",
    "this property indeed appears if the extra degrees of freedom are modeled by an additional @xmath69 qubits , and the frw states are taken as typical superpositions of @xmath74 product states in the enlarged hilbert space . ]",
    "an important point is that the set of states with a fixed @xmath72 does not comprise a hilbert space .",
    "moreover , the set of states with any fixed @xmath72 spans the _ entire _ hilbert space , containing all frw universes corresponding to all values of @xmath72 . for example",
    ", we may obtain a state with any @xmath115 by superposing @xmath116 states with @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",
    "we may also obtain a state with @xmath1 as a superposition of carefully chosen @xmath119 states with @xmath117 .",
    "these statements do not depend on the details of the model and are manifestations of the fact that entanglement , and thus spacetime geometry , can not be represented by a linear operator at the microscopic level .",
    "figure  [ fig : sketch ] depicts a sketch of the hilbert space structure described here .     for illustrative purposes .",
    "to go outside a subspace with a fixed @xmath0 , an exponentially large number of microstates must be superposed .",
    "the same is true to go to a smaller subspace with @xmath1.,height=170 ]",
    "one might worry that the hilbert space structure described above may not allow for a consistent interpretation of superpositions of semiclassical universes .",
    "for example , consider two states representing universes with @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , which contain respectively @xmath123 and @xmath124 product states ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "their superposition contains @xmath126 product states .",
    "does this mean that a superposition of @xmath120 and @xmath121 universes always leads to a @xmath121 universe , making any reasonable many worlds interpretation of spacetime impossible ?",
    "below we show that this is not the case .",
    "in particular , information about each semiclassical spacetime is contained in the exponentially differing size of the coefficients when the state is expanded in the product state basis .",
    "we regard universes with the equation of state parameters falling in a range @xmath127 to be macroscopically identical . here , @xmath128 is a small number that does not scale with @xmath40 .",
    "we then find that a superposition of less than @xmath129 microstates representing a universe with some @xmath0 leads only to another microstate representing the same @xmath0 universe .",
    "in other words , @xmath130 microstates of the universe with _ any _ @xmath0 form an `` effective vector space '' unless we consider a superposition of an exponentially large , @xmath131 , number of microstates .    how about a superposition of states representing universes with different @xmath0 s ? consider two _ normalized _ microstates of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) : @xmath132 where @xmath133 , and the coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath134 are random as are the binary values @xmath113 and @xmath135 .",
    "we are interested in understanding the physical meaning of the normalized superposition @xmath136 the reduced density matrix for the first @xmath78 qubits ( @xmath137 ) is @xmath138 because of the normalization conditions @xmath139 @xmath140 takes the form @xmath141 up to corrections exponentially suppressed in @xmath69 .",
    "( for a detailed derivation , see ref .",

    ". the matrix @xmath140 thus takes the form of an incoherent classical mixture .",
    "moreover , the simple form of the matrices in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rho_n - sep ] ,  [ eq : rho_n-1 ] ) implies that the entanglement entropies are also incoherently added @xmath150 where @xmath151 are the entanglement entropies obtained if the state were @xmath152 .",
    "this indicates that unless @xmath153 or @xmath154 is suppressed exponentially in @xmath69 , the state @xmath95 admits the usual interpretation of a superposition of macroscopically different universes with @xmath155 corresponding to @xmath156 .",
    "similarly , unless a superposition involves exponentially many microstates , we find @xmath157 for @xmath137 , up to exponentially suppressed corrections .",
    "we thus conclude that the standard many worlds interpretation applies to classical spacetimes under any reasonable measurements ( only ) in the limit that @xmath158 is regarded as zero , i.e.  unless a superposition involves exponentially many terms or an exponentially small coefficient .",
    "this picture is consonant with the observation that classical spacetime has an intrinsically thermodynamic nature  @xcite .",
    "we expect that the picture given here persists in the existence of excitations on semiclassical backgrounds .",
    "these excitations can be represented by non - linear / state - dependent operators at the microscopic level , along the lines of ref .",
    "( for earlier work , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in fact , since entropies associated with the excitations are typically subdominant in @xmath40  @xcite , they have only minor effects on the overall picture .",
    "therefore , we effectively obtain a direct sum structure  @xcite for the hilbert space @xmath159 despite the much more intricate structure of the fundamental hilbert space .",
    "finally , this fundamental hilbert space structure suggests that the time evolution operator leading to the change of the leaf area is also non - linear at the fundamental level .",
    "this does not require the time evolution of semiclassical degrees of freedom to be non - linear , since the definition of these degrees of freedom would also be non - linear at the fundamental level .",
