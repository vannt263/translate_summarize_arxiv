    "we will restrict the considered set of beltrami differentials to those whose restrictions to every leaf and every fiber belong to @xmath36 respectively .",

    "compact solenoidal laminations by riemann surfaces ( _ solenoidal surfaces _ ) appear in various branches of mathematics .",

    "@xcite it is constructed the universal teichmller space of the solenoidal surface @xmath70 obtained by taking the inverse limit of all finite pointed covers of a compact surface of genus greater than one and chosen base point .",
    "the sequence of the chosen base points upstairs in the covers determine a point and a distinguished leaf @xmath71 in the inverse limit solenoidal surface . in this space , the commensurability automorphism group of the fundamental group of any higher genus compact surface acts by isometries . by definition , this group is independent of the genus .",
    "the space of hyperbolic structures up to isometry preserving the distinguished leaf on this solenoidal surface @xmath70 is non hausdorff and any hausdorff quotient is a point .",
    "the proof of this result relies on the recent deep results due to jeremy kahn and vladimir markovi on the validity of the ehrenpreis conjecture @xcite .",
    "the remark by sullivan is that the action of the commensurability automorphism group of the fundamental group is not only by isometries but also minimal .",
    "this action is described in the paper in _ acta mathematica _",
    "@xcite mentioned before .",
    "concerning dynamical systems theory , d. sullivan @xcite studies the linking between universalities of milnor - thurston , feigenbaum s ( quantitative ) and ahlfors - bers . as he points out",
    ", @xmath72 ( his second example ) is the basic solenoidal surface required in the dynamical theory of feigenbaum s universality @xcite . here",
    "@xmath73 is the 2-adic solenoid .",
    "this work was continued , for instance , in the use of 3-dimensional hyperbolic laminations by misha lyubich and yair minsky . in @xcite .",
    "another important application of solenoidal surfaces follows from the fact that they parametrize tessellation spaces @xcite .    we hope that the theory of adelic beltrami differentials developed in this work shed some new light on these universalities .    in this paper",
    "we also describe different equivalent teichmller models .",
    "this is a straightforward generalization of the classical models .",
    "the relation with sullivan s work is the following : there is a canonical continuous injective map @xmath74    finally , we construct the p - adic generalization to the nag - verjovsky map in @xcite : @xmath75 we prove that this map is differentiable analytic .",
    "this is another main result of the paper .",
    "we would like to point out that one of the motivations of this map was its relation to _ string theory _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we believe that the theory developed here could be applied to p - adic string theory and its relationship with number theory .",
    "in what follows we will identify the group @xmath76 with the unit circle @xmath77 and the finite cyclic group @xmath78 with the group of @xmath79 roots of unity in @xmath3 .    by covering space theory , for any integer @xmath80 , it is defined the unbranched covering space of degree @xmath57 , @xmath81 given by @xmath82 .",
