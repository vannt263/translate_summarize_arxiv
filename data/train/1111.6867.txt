    "sensitive space - based photometry from corot @xcite and _ kepler _",
    "@xcite has enabled detection and characterization of radial and non - radial acoustic ( i.e. p - mode ) oscillations in thousands of red giant stars @xcite with frequencies centered at @xmath9 consistent with the scaling of the acoustic cutoff frequency @xcite .",
    "these modes generate photometric variability ranging from 5 to 1000 parts per million @xcite and have lifetimes of at least 15 days @xcite .",
    "their excitation and damping ( and thereby their resulting amplitudes ; @xcite ) is related to the presence of vigorous convection within the star ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of these oscillations are p - modes with nearly evenly spaced frequencies at @xmath10 a relation used with equation ( [ eq : numax ] ) to determine the stellar mass , @xmath11 , and radius @xmath12 from the measured @xmath13 , effective temperature @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the implied relation between @xmath13 and @xmath7 has also been confirmed observationally @xcite .",
    "space - based observations @xcite also enabled the detection of the angular degree @xmath4 mixed modes , which have p - mode characteristics in the red giant envelope , but g - mode characteristics in the helium core @xcite .",
    "modes nearly evenly spaced in period , at @xmath16 , around the @xmath4 p - modes were identified by @xcite as a characteristic of the interior core g - modes allowing @xcite to distinguish first ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) stars ( i.e. those with degenerate helium cores ) from red clump stars ( i.e. those with non - degenerate he burning cores ) .",
    "this separation in the @xmath17 diagram was also seen by corot @xcite , and is a powerful new tool for stellar population studies .",
    "we show here that this new capability to probe the deep interior of a red giant should allow for the identification of those @xmath18 stars undergoing the helium core flash .",
    "known for more than 40 years as the defining event that ends the ascent of low mass stars up the rgb ( and defines the tip of the rgb ; @xcite ) , this thermally unstable and off - center helium burning leads to a @xmath19 myr phase of successive he subflashes @xcite that remove electron degeneracy and convert the he core to a stably burning non - degenerate object . however , there has been debate ( see review by @xcite ) as to whether the initiating flash can become dynamical in some way , or rather remains hydrostatic .    using the @xmath2 code @xcite",
    ", we start in  2 by describing the changes in the red giant envelope and helium core during the core flash .",
    "we work in the wentzel , kramers , brillouin ( wkb ) approximation in  3 , summarizing the p - mode and g - mode properties during the helium core flash .",
    "we close in  4 by discussing how stars in this phase of evolution can be differentiated from the more numerous populations of rgb and clump stars .",
    "evolved stars with @xmath20 undergo a he core flash that ends their rgb evolution , and leads them to the red clump where they undergo core he burning for @xmath21 myrs .",
    "the flash starts as an off - center thermally unstable ignition of helium burning at a mass coordinate about half - way through the @xmath22 he core @xcite , nearly independent of metallicity and @xmath11 .    using @xmath2 version 3709 , we have calculated this evolution for a range of @xmath11 , all with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , treating convection with the schwarzshild criterion ( i.e. no semiconvection , thermohaline mixing or convective overshoot ) and a mixing length parameter of @xmath25 .",
    "we had no mass loss , diffusion , or rotation and we used the @xmath2  basic \" @xcite nuclear network with rates from nacre .",
    "the opacity was from opal @xcite , with the low temperature opacities taken from @xcite with metal ratios given by @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "we used the opal equation - of - state @xcite , and helm extensions @xcite where needed .",
    "the evolutionary tracks in figure [ fig : hrevol ] for a @xmath26 and @xmath27 star are for the time before , during , and after the core flash phase .",
    "the he core expansion from the initiating flash leads to an adiabatic temperature drop in the overlying h burning shell ; quenching the burning .",
    "this loss of an energy source for the red giant envelope triggers a kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) contraction from the tip of the rgb on a rapid timescale @xcite , reaching @xmath28 in @xmath29 years ( the open blue circles ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the he core flash phase is governed by a series of shell subflashes that increase the entropy of the convective regions .",
    "this is seen in figure [ fig : structure ] , where five successive subflashes are seen to move inwards in mass coordinates",
    ". however , convective he burning is present for only about 10% of the time .",
    "the @xmath19 myr timescale is set by the need for thermal diffusion to act inwards between subflashes , ending when the thermal wave reaches the core @xcite , heating it at nearly constant pressure @xcite to the condition needed for the convective he burning core phase of the red clump .",
    "we end figure [ fig : structure ] at that time .",
    "even though the he burning luminosities ( blue dashed lines ) get quite large ( @xmath30 in the initiating flash at @xmath31 ) , @xcite have shown that the heating from he burning always occurs on a timescale much longer than the local dynamical time , an outcome confirmed in multi - dimensions by @xcite .",
    "the stellar response during the 2 myr core flash phase is shown in figure [ fig : structure ] and form the basis for our asteroseismological work .",
    "the non - radial adiabatic mode structures for rgb and red clump stars have been studied , with focus on the @xmath4 mixed modes that reveal core properties @xcite .",
    "these mixed modes have a p - mode quality in the outer parts of the star ( where they are excited by convection , and typically have @xmath32 radial nodes ) , but penetrate into the stellar core as very high order ( @xmath33 ) g - modes .",
    "this justifies our initial exploration in the wkb limit @xcite , where the local ( at radius @xmath34 ) radial wavenumber , @xmath35 , is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mode frequency , @xmath38 is the sound speed , @xmath39 is the brunt - visla frequency , and @xmath40 is the lamb frequency .",
    "figure [ fig : brunt ] shows the propagation diagrams ( radial profiles of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) for four phases of the @xmath26 model , all chosen when @xmath44hz .",
    "these resulted in nearly the same values of @xmath45hz ( denoted by the horizontal line ) . from top to bottom , the panels are for @xmath46 myrs prior to the initiating flash ( on the rgb ) , @xmath47 myrs ( after the initiating flash ) , @xmath48 myrs ( during a convective he burning subflash ) and @xmath49 myrs when the star is in the convective he core burning phase of the red clump .    modes supported by the acoustic response of the envelope ( i.e. p - modes ) propagate in the outer parts of the star where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . since @xmath39 is either zero or very small there , we set @xmath52 .",
    "the eigenfrequencies are then found by setting @xmath53 . in the extreme limit of @xmath54 ,",
    "this simplifies to @xmath55 , where the integral extends over the outer parts of the star where @xmath50 .",
    "tradition is to write this as @xmath56 , where the `` large spacing '' @xmath15 is defined with the integral over the whole star , @xmath57 a reasonably accurate representation .",
    "modes supported by the internal buoyancy ( i.e. g - modes ) propagate in the stellar interior , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . as evident from figure [ fig : brunt ] , these inequalities are strong for frequencies @xmath60 , yielding @xmath61 . the high radial order ( @xmath62 )",
    "g - modes then have @xmath63 , yielding @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being the period spacing . for @xmath4 ,",
    "this is @xmath66 at @xmath13 , @xmath67 , safely in the wkb limit .",
    "the integral @xmath68 extends over the region where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "now consider how @xmath65 and @xmath15 evolve during the core flash phase .",
    "the kh contraction after the initiating flash triggers a rapid decrease to @xmath69 , and the increase of @xmath7 evident in the second panel of figure [ fig : seismo ] .",
    "thereafter , the value of @xmath15 simply responds to the mild radius changes during subsequent subflashes .",
    "the he core radius expansion and outer envelope contraction triggered by the initiating he flash leads to an outer envelope structure during the @xmath19 myr that is nearly the same as that on the red clump .",
    "indeed , the profiles of @xmath39 and @xmath70 in figure [ fig : brunt ] for the bottom three panels ( all after the initiating flash ) are nearly identical for @xmath71 .",
    "the prime property that is changing over the 2 myr is the he core , as it undergoes additional subflashes that lift the degeneracy of the deep interior .",
    "the @xmath4 g - mode period spacings for the models in figure [ fig : brunt ] are @xmath72 s for the rgb , @xmath73 s for the core flash phase model between subflashes ( second panel ) , and @xmath74 s for the red clump . during the convective he burning shell subflashes ( less than 10% of the he core flash phase , so @xmath75 years ) , an intervening evanescent zone appears in the core ( see third panel in figure [ fig : brunt ] ) . though coupling through this zone is possible ( see below ) , we calculated the period spacing assuming that only the outer g - mode cavity is relevant , giving @xmath76 s during each sub - flash .",
    "as evident in the third panel of figure [ fig : seismo ] , the existence of a degenerate core with @xmath77 during the most of the core flash period keeps @xmath78 s. the fully convective he burning core of the red clump is what causes the increase to @xmath74 s @xcite at the end of figure [ fig : seismo ] .    the @xmath4 mixed modes are more likely to be detected when the coupling through the outer evanescent region ( the region in the star where @xmath51 and @xmath59 so that @xmath79 ) is strong . in the wkb limit ,",
    "the ratio of the mode amplitudes ( and also location of the mode energy ) between the two turning points , the inner one at @xmath80 ( where @xmath58 first occurs ) and the outer one at @xmath81 ( where @xmath50 first occurs ) is largely determined by @xmath82 , but also depends on @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite . ) , the mode amplitude ratio is @xmath83 . ]",
    "the coupling of the @xmath4 modes is stronger than that of @xmath84 simply because the outer turning point is closer to the core for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath85 ( calculated at @xmath86 ) for the models in figure [ fig : brunt ] are @xmath87 for the rgb , and @xmath88 for the other three models ( which have nearly identical outer envelopes ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : seismo ] shows that @xmath85 changes little over the 2 myr , giving us confidence that the seismic probe of the core will be as fruitful for the he core flash stars as the red clump .",
    "we have not fully investigated the mode structure during the subflashes . however , a few things can be said .",
    "the first is that an additional inner evanescent zone appears during subflashes ( the region at @xmath89 in the third panel of figure [ fig : brunt ] ) splitting the g - mode cavity into two zones , each with their own distinct period spacing .",
    "this adds an additional evanescent integral @xmath90^{1/2}d\\log r\\approx 0.72 $ ] that must be accounted for in the observable mode structure .",
    "due to that extra penalty , we chose to display ( in figure [ fig : seismo ] ) the period spacing during the subflashes as that of the outermost g - mode cavity .",
    "if the inner cavity proves to be adequately coupled , these extra modes would cause oscillations in the observed period spacing diagram .",
    "that full analysis awaits our future efforts .",
    "our results are best seen in relation to the observational work performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their secure detection of mixed modes and measurement of their period spacing , @xmath16 , led to a clear distinction ( see figure [ fig : data ] ) of rgb stars ( blue points ) from the red clump stars ( red points ) of @xmath91 and the extended red clump ( yellow points ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath65 for our @xmath92 ( green lines ) and a @xmath93 ( black lines ) models are shown in figure [ fig : data ] as a dashed line for the rgb , a solid line during the core flash and a short - dashed line for the core he burning phase .",
    "@xcite discussed the challenge of securely inferring @xmath65 when only a few mixed modes are observed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , they found that the measured spacing , @xmath16 , would be less than @xmath65 by a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "such a need for scaling is evident along the rgb , and will be best resolved by longer duration _ kepler _ data that reveals additional mixed modes .",
    "this should prove possible given their much longer expected lifetimes @xcite .",
    "stars undergoing the core flash occupy a distinct region in figure [ fig : data ] .",
    "the only other models that traverse this region are @xmath95 rgb stars , and potentially agb stars , both reasonably rare instances that will need to be observationally distinguished .",
    "the simplest technique is to use the measured @xmath13 values , as @xmath96 hz for the @xmath97 and @xmath98 rgb models , whereas @xmath99 hz during the core flash for the @xmath92 model of figure [ fig : seismo ] .",
    "all objects with @xmath100 s and @xmath101 are worthy of a serious analysis to see if they are explained as @xmath102 core flash stars rather than @xmath103 rgb stars .",
    "we highlight three such candidates in figure [ fig : data ] by slightly enlarging their blue points .",
    "since @xmath16 is always less than @xmath65 , these points could only move upwards in this diagram , placing them securely in the region of interest .",
    "there are 193 red clump stars in this figure , so we expect about @xmath104 flashing stars , consistent with the few  outliers \" in this early data set .",
    "@xcite showed that the expected metallicity of most of the corot red giants is near solar , with a few as low as one - tenth solar .",
    "our @xmath2 runs for one - tenth solar occupy a comparable part of this diagram , though they go to slightly higher values of @xmath15 during the flash due to reaching a lower luminosity during kh contraction .",
    "there is much to be learned from the asteroseismic discovery and analysis of a star undergoing the core flash phase .",
    "it would be an immediate confirmation of the @xmath105 myr duration of the event ; eliminating the alternate possibilities of more dynamical outcomes .",
    "study and analysis of the g - modes may reveal the specific stage of evolution for such a star in the 2 myr phase .",
    "any possible inferences regarding the rotation rate of the core during these 2 myrs would be especially valuable , as the short timescales may not allow for perfectly rigid core rotation .",
    "another path to detection of this rare phase was highlighted by @xcite , who noted that rgb stars with substantial mass loss will cross the rr lyrae instability strip on their way to the horizontal branch .",
    "those stars would then exhibit a detectable pulsation period change due to their secular evolution .",
    "additional calculations are certainly needed , both to fully explore lower metallicities , as well as to see how additional mixing mechanisms ( e.g. thermohaline ) may impact the qualitative evolution .",
    "fully consistent pulsation calculations are needed , both to confirm the wkb estimates here , but also to provide damping times and to explore the interesting periods of subflashes ( only relevant for @xmath106 years ) that may prove detectable if the sample size of red giants with measured @xmath65 gets large enough .",
    "we thank t. bedding , t. brown , j. christensen - dalsgaard and v. silva aguirre for discussions .",
