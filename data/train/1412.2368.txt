    "in mathematical science , homology is a general procedure to associate a sequence of abelian groups or modules to a given topological space and/or manifold @xcite .",
    "the idea of homology dates back to euler and riemann , although homology class was first rigorously defined by henri poincar , who built the foundation of the modern algebraic topology .",
    "the topological structure of a given manifold can be studied via defining the different dimensional homology groups on the manifold such that the bases of the homology groups are isomorphic to the bases of the corresponding topological spaces . in computational perspective",
    ", a given manifold can be approximated by the triangulated simplicial complex , on which homology groups can be further defined .",
    "the triangulation of a manifold or a topological space can be realized through a number of methods , such as delaunay triangulation .",
    "there are many triangulation software packages , such as http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/[tetgen ] and https://www.cgal.org/[cgal ] . in scientific computing ,",
    "the cartesian representation is one of most important approaches in numerical analysis .",

    "@xcite introduced first efficient algorithm for persistent homology analysis .",
    "the generalization of persistent homology was given by zomorodian and carlsson @xcite .",
    "in the past decade , persistent homology has been developed as an efficient computational tool for the characterization , identification and analysis ( cia ) of topological features in large data sets @xcite .",
    "topological persistence over the filtration process can be captured continuously over a range of spatial scales in persistent homology analysis . unlike commonly used computational homology which results in truly metric free or coordinate free representations , persistent homology is able to embed geometric information to topological invariants so that the  birth \" and  death \" of isolated components , circles , rings , loops , pockets , voids or cavities at all geometric scales can be monitored by topological measurements .",
    "compared with traditional computational topology @xcite and/or computational homology , persistent homology inherently has an additional dimension , namely , the filtration parameter , which can be utilized to embed some crucial geometry or quantitative information into the topological invariants .",
    "barcode representation has been proposed for the visualization of topological persistence @xcite , in which various horizontal line segments or bars are utilized to represent the persistence of the topological features .",

    "indeed , there is little literature about the use of persistent homology as a quantitative tool , i.e. , for mathematical modeling and physical prediction , to our best knowledge .",
    "recently , we have introduced molecular topological fingerprints ( mtfs ) as an efficient approach for protein cia @xcite .",

    "based on differential geometry , wei and coworkers introduced the first variational solvent - solute interface : the minimal molecular surface ( mms ) for molecular surface representation in 2006 @xcite . since the surface free energy is the product of surface tension and surface area , the minimization of the surface free energy leads to the laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "one then obtains the laplace - beltrami flow by adopting an artificial time .",
    "the laplace - beltrami flow approach has been used to calculate both solvation energies and electrostatics of proteins @xcite .",
    "we have proposed potential - driven geometric flows , which admit non - curvature - driven terms , for biomolecular surface construction subject to potential interactions @xcite . while our approaches were employed by many others @xcite for molecular surface analysis , our curvature - controlled pdes and the differential geometry based laplace - beltrami models @xcite are , to our knowledge , the first of their kind for biomolecular surface and electrostatics / solvation modeling .",
    "using the variational principle , wei introduced differential geometry based multiscale models in 2009 @xcite .",
    "the essential idea is to use the differential geometry theory of surfaces as a natural means to geometrically separate the macroscopic domain of the biomolecule from the microscopic domain of the solvent , and to dynamically couple the continuum treatment of the solvent from the discrete description of the biomolecule . in the past few years",

    "we utilize differential geometry theory of surfaces to minimize the surface free energy , which results in an objective - oriented partial differential equation , i.e. , the laplace - beltrami flow .",
    "the evolution of the laplace - beltrami flow creates a multiscale representation of a nano - bio object , which naturally constitutes a filtration and gives rise to a differential geometry based persistent homology method . the proposed differential geometry based persistent homology is utilized to analyze nano - bio data .",
    "the topological invariants of a given nano - bio object are extracted from the evolutionary profiles of the laplace - beltrami flow .",

    "<S> persistent homology provides a new approach for the topological simplification of big data via measuring the life time of intrinsic topological features in a filtration process and has found its success in scientific and engineering applications . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a success is essentially limited to qualitative data characterization , identification and analysis ( cia ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , persistent homology has rarely been employed for quantitative modeling and prediction . additionally , the present persistent homology is a passive tool , rather than a proactive technique , for cia . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we outline a general protocol to construct objective - oriented persistent homology methods . by means of differential geometry theory of surfaces , </S>",
    "<S> we construct an objective functional , namely , a surface free energy defined on the data of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the minimization of the objective functional leads to a laplace - beltrami operator which generates a multiscale representation of the initial data and offers an objective oriented filtration process . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting differential geometry based objective - oriented persistent homology is able to preserve desirable geometric features in the evolutionary filtration and enhances the corresponding topological persistence . </S>",
    "<S> the cubical complex based homology algorithm is employed in the present work to be compatible with the cartesian representation of the laplace - beltrami flow . the proposed laplace - beltrami flow based persistent homology method </S>",
    "<S> is extensively validated . </S>",
    "<S> the consistence between laplace - beltrami flow based filtration and euclidean distance based filtration is confirmed on the vietoris - rips complex for a large amount of numerical tests . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence and reliability of the present laplace - beltrami flow based cubical complex filtration approach are analyzed over various spatial and temporal mesh sizes . </S>",
    "<S> the laplace - beltrami flow based persistent homology approach is utilized to study the intrinsic topology of proteins and fullerene molecules . </S>",
    "<S> based on a quantitative model which correlates the topological persistence of fullerene central cavity with the total curvature energy of the fullerene structure , the proposed method is used for the prediction of fullerene isomer stability . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency and robustness of the present method are verified by more than 500 fullerene molecules . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the proposed persistent homology based quantitative model offers good predictions of total curvature energies for ten types of fullerene isomers . the present work offers the first example to design objective - oriented persistent homology to enhance or preserve desirable features in the original data during the filtration process and then automatically detect or extract the corresponding topological traits from the data .     </S>",
