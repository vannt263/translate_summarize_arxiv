    "in recent years , redshift surveys have enabled us to construct the optical luminosity function ( lf ) for normal field galaxies up to @xmath6 , and there is now general agreement that the comoving density of actively starforming galaxies was higher in the past ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity function , however , is only a statistical description of the galaxy population , and additional information on the nature of individual galaxies is needed in order to understand the causes of any changes seen in the lf .",
    "the internal kinematics of a galaxy are closely related to its mass , and can help place constraints on the kind of galaxy that is being observed ; in particular , different types of galaxies show characteristic scaling relations of size and velocity width @xmath5 , or rotation velocity @xmath7 . in principle , these scaling relations provide clues about the _ nature _ of a galaxy independently of any changes in luminosity or morphology that may be caused by bursts of star formation .",
    "the internal kinematics of distant galaxies can most readily be studied via optical emission lines , such as h@xmath8 or the [ oii ] 3727  line , and in recent years several kinematic studies of faint galaxies have been published ( e.g. @xcite ; guzmn et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 , 1998 ; @xcite ; vogt et al .  1996 , 1997 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some of these groups report significant evolution at even moderate redshifts , while others find little or no evolution to @xmath6 .",
    "however , sample selection criteria varied widely , so these apparent discrepancies could potentially be reconciled if evolution is not uniform for all types of galaxies .",
    "we have undertaken a kinematic study of a sample of starforming galaxies selected from the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) for which we have hubble space telescope ( hst ) images .",
    "our aim was to look at the general starforming galaxy population at @xmath9 , where changes in the blue lf are clearly evident .",
    "our sample was selected _ regardless of galaxy size or morphology _ , and is representative of the bluest @xmath3 of the galaxies in the cfrs .",
    "the sample is described in  2 , the extraction of velocities is discussed in  3 , and the results from our study are presented in  4 .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in  5 . throughout this paper , we have adopted @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "new spectroscopic observations were undertaken with the subarcsecond imaging spectrograph ( sis ) at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on 1998 june 21 - 25 , 1996 april 20 - 23 , and 1995 october 27 - 30 .",
    "the sis is equipped with an active guiding system , yielding a typical psf of 0.5 - 0.7  fwhm .",
    "effective slit widths were typically 0.5 - 0.8  , and resolutions ( fwhm of arc lines ) were in the range 1.2 - 4.1  .",
    "target galaxies were selected from the subset of the cfrs which has been imaged by hst ( see @xcite and references therein ) . based on the hst images , we constructed multi - object masks in which slits were aligned along the major axis of each galaxy .",
    "slits were placed over every available known galaxy _",
    "regardless _ of its size or morphology , but with preference given to galaxies with strong emission lines",
    ". objects with unreliable spectra ( e.g. a bad column , too close to the edge of the slit ) were removed from the sample .",
    "the sample selection is illustrated in figure 1 , which shows a plot of rest - frame @xmath13  vs.  @xmath14 for our sample ( large symbols ) and other cfrs galaxies ( small crosses ) .",
    "the 30 galaxies for which we were able to measure the velocity width of their emission lines ( large filled symbols ) were generally blue .",
    "we successfully measured @xmath5 for every observed galaxy with rest - frame @xmath15 ( dotted line ) , which is roughly the color of a local scd galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the typical [ oii ] 3727  rest - frame equivalent width for the @xmath9 blue galaxies is @xmath1660 , as compared to @xmath1640  at @xmath17 .",
    "the sample has the same @xmath18 magnitude limit as the cfrs ; thus , our kinematic sample represents the bluest @xmath3 of the cfrs galaxies , which is precisely the population that shows the strongest evolution in the luminosity function to @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we chose the velocity width @xmath5 to characterize the kinematics , since ( a ) the nature of galaxies in our sample was not known _ a priori _ , and @xmath5 is a general parameter which applies to both ordered rotation and random motions , ( b ) many galaxies at high @xmath14 were too small to reliably measure rotation curves , and ( c ) summing all the light increased the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in our spectra .",
    "similarly , we chose the half - light radius r@xmath19 to characterize galaxy sizes , since it is a general parameter that applies to galaxies with any light profile .",
    "half - light radii were derived from two - dimensional modeled fits to the hst images , and account for the effects of the psf ( see section 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "internal velocities were measured from the [ oii ] 3727  doublet for galaxies at @xmath4 , and from [ oiii ] 5007  or h@xmath20 for those at @xmath21 .",
    "emission lines were fit by gaussians , using the fit / deblending option within the splot task in iraf , yielding an observed velocity width @xmath22fwhm@xmath23 .",
    "gaussian fits to calibration and sky lines were used to obtain an instrumental resolution width @xmath24 for each spectrum , and the velocity width @xmath25 was then computed for each object .",
    "error bars reflect the uncertainties of the gaussian fits and the effects of poor sampling and non - gaussian slit profiles ( based on simulations ) .    a detailed analysis of the potential systematic errors will be presented in malln - ornelas et al .",
    "( 1999 ) but the main issues are addressed here .",
    "one concern is that the emission line used for the kinematic measurements may be coming from a small region of the galaxy , and thus yield an underestimate of the true velocity width .",
    "we compared the spatial extent of the emission line on the 2-d spectrogram and found it was consistent with the size of the continuum in every case except one .",
    "this discrepant galaxy was one of the three which showed morphological evidence for a merger , and it indeed had a very large velocity width ; the three galaxies with merger morphology have been omitted from the analysis below .    another possible concern is the effect of galaxy inclination on the measured projected velocities .",
    "the three face - on galaxies in our sample ( axial ratios in the range @xmath26 ) have been omitted from the velocity analysis , since in addition to the projection effects on the measured velocity , there is considerable uncertainty in placing the slit along the kinematic major axis of the galaxy .",
    "slit orientation should not have a significant effect on the rest of the sample , since slits were oriented along the major axis of each galaxy , as measured from hst images . finally , there is little worry that we have a detection bias against galaxies with large internal velocities , since we have measured @xmath5 for a complete magnitude - limited sample of galaxies with rest - frame @xmath27 .",
    "after the three mergers and the three face - on galaxies were removed , we were left with a sample of 24 galaxies to be used in the analysis .",
    "galaxies in our sample were examined by comparing their kinematics ( @xmath5 ) , sizes ( @xmath28 ) and luminosities ( @xmath29 ) with those of various types of local galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath5 vs. @xmath28 and @xmath5 vs. @xmath29 for samples of local galaxies ( top 8 panels , small symbols ) , cfrs galaxies at @xmath21 ( top 8 panels , large symbols ) , and cfrs galaxies at @xmath4 ( bottom 2 panels ) .",
    "data for local bulges are from bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and data for hii galaxies are from telles & terlevich ( 1997 ) and telles , melnick , & terlevich ( 1997 ) .",
    "data for spiral and irregular galaxies are from the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( @xcite , hereafter rc3 ) . for this last data",
    "set , we took @xmath30 .",
    "as with the cfrs sample , local face - on spirals and irregulars ( @xmath26 ) were omitted , but no other inclination correction was made .",
    "the @xmath21 cfrs galaxies were classified morphologically from their hst images , and are plotted in the corresponding panels . on the @xmath5 vs. @xmath28 diagram ( left panels ) , most @xmath21 cfrs galaxies lie within the loci defined by local galaxies of the same morphological class . the @xmath5 vs. @xmath29 plots ( right panels ) show that these galaxies have luminosities similar to those of local galaxies of similar morphological type and kinematics , but those classified as late spirals or irregulars are generally on the brighter side of the locus . however",
    ", we will not explicitly translate this into a change in luminosity ( or density ) since ( a ) neither our cfrs sample nor our local comparison sample are complete for the fainter magnitudes , so it is impossible to compute a shift in luminosity between the two populations , and ( b ) our @xmath21 blue sample is quite small , the velocity widths have large error bars , and many of these widths were measured on the [ oiii ] 5007   line , which may lead to poorly understood systematic errors .",
    "thus , the amount of any evolution required in the @xmath21 population is uncertain .",
    "the @xmath31 cfrs galaxies ( with median @xmath9 ) have irregular or late spiral morphologies , and are plotted separately in the bottom two panels .",
    "these galaxies lie in a small region of ( @xmath5,@xmath28 ,  @xmath29)-space , with typical values of @xmath32km / s,@xmath33kpc ,  and @xmath34log@xmath35 .",
    "this region is outlined with a box which is reproduced in the upper 8 panels .",
    "the small range in @xmath29 comes from the fact that the original cfrs was a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "an object s location in the @xmath5 vs. @xmath28 plane is _ in principle _ independent of luminosity evolution and can serve to identify possible local counterparts of the @xmath9 population .",
    "as can be seen from the left - hand panels of figure 2 , the sizes and kinematics of the @xmath9 cfrs galaxies are similar to those of typical irregulars in the rc3 .",
    "this is consistent with their morphologies as seen in hst images ( @xcite ) and their blue rest - frame colors .",
    "however , one can see on the @xmath5 vs. @xmath36 panel ( on the right ) that only the brightest local irregulars are as bright as the @xmath9 galaxies , and a typical local irregular with similar size and kinematics is @xmath162 magnitudes dimmer .",
    "note that changing the cosmology to one of lower @xmath37 would not significantly alter our result ( e.g. adopting @xmath38 would make the @xmath9 galaxies @xmath1612% larger and @xmath160.25 mag brighter ) .",
    "thus , when we look at the galaxies with blue colors and @xmath39 that are producing the largest changes in the galaxian luminosity function to @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , we find galaxies that have the colors , morphologies , sizes , and kinematics of typical irregular galaxies in the present - day universe , but which are @xmath162 mag brighter than the average irregular galaxy seen nearby .",
    "there are , however , some bright irregulars nearby ( e.g. ngc  5464 , ngc  4194 , ngc  3239 and mrk  330 ) that have same @xmath5 ,  @xmath28 , _ and _ @xmath29 as the high - redshift galaxies .    determining",
    "the average evolutionary change in luminosity ( @xmath40 ) is almost impossible from a magnitude - limited sample such as the one used here  and in all other studies  unless one can claim to be `` complete '' in some class of galaxy ( c.f .",
    "the discussion of `` big disks '' in @xcite ) ; otherwise , it is impossible to talk about the change in luminosity for a given class of galaxies , when we can not see the fainter members of the class . thus , our size and kinematic data for blue galaxies at @xmath31 are consistent with either ( a ) a luminosity evolution @xmath41 mag to @xmath9 , or ( b ) a density enhancement by a factor of @xmath42 ( based on the lf ) and no change in luminosity , or ( c ) a combination of both luminosity and density evolution .    a full comparison with other kinematic data in the literature will be presented in malln - ornelas et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , but it should be noted here that the amount of luminosity evolution inferred by different authors strongly depends on the local sample used for comparisons . in particular , we stress that the tully - fisher relation as defined by spiral galaxies is not necessarily the most appropriate comparison for _ small _ galaxies with low masses , as seen at high redshift , regardless of their luminosities .",
    "furthermore , as long as one is sampling a small range of magnitudes , it is impossible to tell whether what is usually interpreted as luminosity evolution of the observed galaxies , is not in fact caused by an increase in the density of a larger population , of which we are only seeing the brightest members .",
    "finally , one must be cautious in assuming that the sizes of individual galaxies remain constant between @xmath9 and the present epoch , since hierarchical merging scenarios predict that galaxies are still growing at these redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the studies of compact galaxies by guzmn et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ) and phillips et al .  ( 1997 ) who found that small galaxies at @xmath43 had high rates of star formation , and provided a large contribution to the evolution of the blue population to @xmath6 .",
    "of the 15 blue galaxies in our @xmath31 sample , 12 meet the guzmn / phillips size and magnitude selection criteria , so it is not surprising that we have reached similar conclusions . it should be emphasized that our results do not disagree with those of vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) , who found little or no evolution from rotation curves of a sample of large disk galaxies .",
    "the blue population , studied here is made up of _ small _ galaxies which would not be included in the vogt et al .",
    "sample ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "although the current generation of kinematic studies is a start , untangling the physical processes responsible for the evolution of the galaxy population will ultimately require detailed physical information ( including masses ) from large samples of galaxies , extending so far down the luminosity function that the serious limitations of magnitude - limited samples are overcome .",
    "we have measured the internal kinematics of a sample of blue cfrs galaxies [ rest - frame @xmath15 ]  for which we have hst images , and have found the following :    \\1 .",
    "luminous blue galaxies at @xmath9 are generally small , have late spiral or irregular morphology , and have kinematics and sizes consistent with those of local irregulars or large hii galaxies , but they are as bright as the brightest local irregulars , and roughly 2 magnitudes brighter than typical irregulars nearby .",
    "the major contribution to the evolution of blue l@xmath45 galaxies to @xmath9 comes from a population of strongly evolving small blue galaxies of mass and morphology similar to that of present - day irregulars .",
