    "self - trapping of multidimensional ( two- and three - dimensional , 2d and 3d ) localized modes in nonlinear dispersive / diffractive media , which are usually categorized as solitons , has been a topic of great interest in many areas of physics , as can be seen from reviews @xcite-@xcite . in particular , this area of the theoretical and experimental studies is highly relevant to nonlinear optics , as well as to nonlinear dynamics of matter waves in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "other essential realizations of multidimensional solitons are known in models of ferromagnets @xcite , superconductors @xcite , and semiconductors @xcite , as well as in nuclear physics @xcite , the classical - field theory hopfion , field - theory ( including famous skyrmions @xcite , which may be considered as 3d solitons ) , and other fields .",
    "in addition to the their significance to fundamental studies , 2d and 3d solitons offer potential applications .",
    "in particular , spatiotemporal optical solitons , alias  light bullets \" @xcite , may be used as data carriers in all - optical data - processing schemes @xcite , and 3d matter - wave solitons are expected to provide a basis for highly precise interferometry @xcite .",
    "unlike 1d solitons , which are usually stable objects @xcite , stability is a major issue for their 2d and 3d counterparts .",
    "indeed , the most common cubic self - focusing nonlinearity , which can easily support 2d and 3d formal solitons solutions , gives rise to the wave collapse ( _ critical _  _ collapse _ in 2d and _ supercritical collapse _ in 3d ) @xcite , which completely destabilizes the respective soliton families .",
    "in particular , the first ever example of solitons which was introduced theoretically in nonlinear optics , _",
    "viz_. , the _ townes solitons _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , 2d self - trapped modes supported by the cubic self - focusing nonlinearity ( in fact , these solutions were discovered before term  soliton \" had been coined ) are subject to the instability caused by the critical collapse , therefore they have never been observed in the experiment .",
    "multidimensional solitons with embedded vorticity , alias 2d vortex rings and 3d vortex tori , which also exist in cubic media ( in particular , there are higher - order versions of townes solitons with embedded vorticity @xcite ) , are vulnerable to a still stronger splitting instability initiated by modulational perturbations in the azimuthal direction ; usually , the modulational instability splits the vortex ring into a few fragments , which resemble fundamental ( zero - vorticity ) solitons and suffer the destruction via the intrinsic collapse or decay into small - amplitude waves (  radiation \" ) @xcite .    thus , the stabilization of multidimensional fundamental and vortex solitons in physically relevant models is an issue of great significance to theoretical studies , and creation of the solitons in the respective physical settings is a challenge to the experiment .",
    "this paper offers a short review of the broad area of theoretical investigations of 2d and 3d solitons , selecting two topics for a relatively detailed presentation , one well - established , and one very recent .",
    "the former one , considered in section ii , relies upon the stabilization of both fundamental ( zero - vorticity ) solitons and ones with embedded vorticity @xmath0 by an external harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) trapping potential , axially or spherically symmetric one .",
    "this topic has been elaborated in detail in the course of the past 20 years @xcite .",
    "a recently developed theme , presented in section iii , is the creation of stable solitons in the 2d and 3d free space ( without the help from any external potential ) , which mix zero - vorticity and vortical components , by means of linear terms that account for the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in binary bec .",
    "this possibility for 2d and 3d solitons was discovered in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "any stabilization mechanism must secure the solitons against the critical collapse in 2d settings , and against the supercritical collapse in the 3d geometry .",
    "this objective is achieved differently in 2d and 3d models , as explained below . in the former case",
    ", the stabilizing factor breaks the specific scale invariance , which underlies the critical collapse , and transforms any originally unstable fundamental soliton in the single - component model , or a mixed ( fundamental - vortical ) soliton in the binary soc system , into a ground state ( gs ) , which does not exists in the unstabilized 2d model .",
    "this is possible because the critical collapse sets in when the norm of the mode exceeds a certain threshold value , and the solitons get stabilized by pushing their norm below the collapse threshold .",
    "vortex solitons with @xmath0 in the 2d single - component model may be stabilized too , as excited states , rather than the gs , provided that their norms are not too large either . on the other hand , in the 3d setting the threshold for the onset of the supercritical collapse is absent , hence a true gs can not be created .",
    "nevertheless , the stabilization of 3d fundamental solitons and vortical ones with @xmath0 in the single - component model , and of 3d mixed modes in the soc system , is possible in the form of _ metastable states _ , which are robust against small perturbations .",
    "a generic method for the stabilization of both fundamental and vortical solitons is the use of trapping potentials , the corresponding model being based on the following nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , alias the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite , for the atomic mean - field wave function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 in the 2d geometry ) and @xmath8 are appropriately scaled spatial coordinates and time:@xmath9here , @xmath10 is the 3d or 2d laplacian , @xmath11 is the trapping potential , and the negative sign in front of the cubic term implies that the nonlinearity is self - attractive .",

    "<S> physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and nonlinear optics are briefly discussed too . unlike 1d solitons , which are typically stable , 2d and 3d ones are vulnerable to the instability induced by the occurrence of the critical and supercritical collapse , respectively , in the same 2d and 3d models that give rise to the solitons . </S>",
    "<S> vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting instability . for this reason , a central problem is looking for physical settings in which 2d and 3d solitons may be stabilized . </S>",

    "<S> viz_. , the stabilization of the 3d and 2d states , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , trapped in harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potentials , and another topic which was developed very recently : the stabilization of 2d and 3d free - space solitons , which mix components with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( _ semi - vortices _ and _ mixed modes _ ) , in a binary system with the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) between its components . in both cases , </S>",

    "<S> , the stabilization mechanism creates a stable ground state ( gs , which was absent without it ) , whose norm falls below the threshold value at which the critical collapse sets in . in the 3d geometry , the supercritical collapse does not allow to create a gs , but metastable solitons can be constructed .    </S>",
