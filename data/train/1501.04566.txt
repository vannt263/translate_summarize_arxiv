    "the notion of negative absolute temperature ( nat ) @xcite has been recently refreshed by braun et _ al _ @xcite . the main factor of novelty was the claim that the nat regime was attained in a system with a _ continuous _ upperly bounded spectrum , in contrast to the preceding experiments based on two - level systems @xcite .",
    "soon after , however , the notion of nat was criticized by dunkel and hilbert @xcite , as a misleading consequence of boltzmann s definition of entropy @xmath3\\:,\\ ] ] in an isolated ( microcanonical ) system of hamiltonian @xmath4 , @xmath5 being any state variable and @xmath6 a generalized kronecher symbol ( boltzmann constant @xmath7 ) .",
    "actually , from the definition of absolute temperature @xmath8 it is seen that nat occurs whenever @xmath9 is a _ decreasing _ function of the energy , which is possible for the entropy , if the energy is upperly bounded ( i.e. @xmath10 ) and the higher energy levels can be overpopulated by suitable external processes . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead , gibbs entropy @xmath11\\ ] ] ( @xmath12 being the heaviside function ) is an increasing function of @xmath13 and thereby excludes any nat regime by definition . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors stress that gibbs definition of entropy refers to a microcanonical system ( a claim that will be reconsidered in what follows ) and satisfies the equipartition theorem in any case , while boltzmann s entropy fails in very small systems , with a number of particles of order unity .    what we playfully call the `` boltzmann _ vs _ gibbs match",
    "'' is right the debate about boltzmann s ( eq.n  ) and gibbs ( eqn .  )",
    "definition of entropy @xcite .",
    "as it is a rule for most polemics involving the entropy , the discussion may look a little bit academic , especially in view of equation  ( 14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that the two entropies and give the same temperature expression , in the thermodynamic limit , with a difference that vanishes as the inverse heat capacity .",
    "given that boltzmann and gibbs s picture lead to the same results in large systems , the alternative looks as follows : either there exists a _ measurable size effect _ displaying some difference between eqn.s   and , or any discussion remains confined to a merely speculative level .",
    "the second possibility looks , at a first sight , much more likely , once one efforts the question how small the size should be , for this effect to be detectable .",
    "actually , one might be tempted to assume that the smallness criterion is determined by @xmath2 ( @xmath0 being the number of particles ) , since from eq.n  ( 14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite the temperatures resulting from eq.n   and differ by terms proportional to the inverse of an extensive quantity ( the heat capacity ) . if this were always the case , any experimental test , like one based on the `` minimal quantum thermometer '' suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , would become extremely difficult , if not impossible .",
    "fairly surprisingly , we shall show that , in certain two - level systems , the difference between certain measurable quantities , derived from eq.n   and , vanishes as @xmath14 .",
    "this result makes the experimental comparison between the two approaches much more accessible , since detecting effects small to order @xmath14 is certainly easier than to order @xmath2 , especially in view of the recent technical progresses of small particle physics .",
    "this is the `` finite - size match '' that we are going to outline in the next sections .    though we shall refer to two - level systems , that represent the preferred framework for nat experiments , we are not specifically interested in the nat problem .",
    "we address to a more fundamental point , that intrigues people since the foundations of statistical thermodynamics , i.e. the definition of entropy in terms of the microscopic dynamical states of the system . very recently ,",
    "hilbert , hnggi and dunkel performed an exhaustive survey of several possible definitions of entropy in continuous spectrum systems @xcite , with special attention to their consistency with the three principles of thermodynamics .",
    "it turns out that the only definition of entropy that satisfies the three principles in arbitrary small systems , is eq.n  .",
    "the flaws resulting from other definitions are , in turn , finite - size effects whose _ measured _ presence would support a widespread opinion ( contrasted by hilbert , hnggi and dunkel ) that thermodynamics applies only to large systems .",
    "another point that we address in the present work is the role of the constraints in the construction of the thermodynamical functions . actually , different constraints ( microcanonical , canonical , grandcanonical ) yield different fluctuations about the equilibrium values of the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "another widespread opinion is that the equilibrium values are , themselves , independent from the constraints .",
    "this justifies the experimental evidence that the constraints are irrelevant in the thermodynamical limit ( and far from the phase transitions ) , since the relative weights of the fluctuations vanish as @xmath14 .",
    "however , the difference between eq.n   and is not due to the fluctuations , but to the genuine notion of thermal equilibrium .",
    "indeed , gibbs s entropy postulates what , in boltzmann s language , sounds like a sort of new ergodic hypothesis , that ( in contrast to what claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) looks hardly appliable to micro - canonical systems .",
    "why should states with energy _ less _ than @xmath13 be involved , if @xmath13 is strictly conserved ? in this concern , it is only boltzmann s entropy that is consistent with the dynamics of an isolated system .",
    "a reasonable possibility is that gibbs and boltzmann s entropies refer to _ canonical _ and _ micro - canonical _ constraints , respectively , which is right the opposite of what the supporters of gibbs entropy do claim @xcite .",
    "the difference between canonical and microcanonical systems will come into play in the study of weiss ferromagnets ( section  [ weiss ] ) . all the way",
    ", it leaves a relevant question pending , to which finite - size experiments could give an answer .",
    "what precedes motivates our program of giving the size effects of interest an analytical form , then studying the feasibility of _ ad hoc _ experiments revealing which of the two entropy definitions does fit better with physical reality , both in canonical and in micro - canonical systems . in order to avoid any possible factor of confusion , it is worthwhile stressing the strategy used in the next sections .",
    "we calculate the quantities of interest as functions of the number @xmath0 of particles , according to gibbs definition eq.n  .",
    "then we compare such quantities with those obtained according to boltzmann s definition , under the _ same _ condition of large but finite @xmath0 . in section  [ weiss ] ( the ising ferromagnet ) this procedure is manifest ( see , for example , fig.s 2 , 3 and 4 ) . in section [ 2levgas ] ,",
    "the boltzmann - formulated quantity ( the energy of the two - level gas ) is reported from other papers ( in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another _ caveat _ is in order : the current way to represent the differences between boltzmann s and gibbs entropies is writing the boltzmann/ gibbs `` temperatures '' @xmath15 , as functions of other state parameter(s ) @xmath5 . however",
    ", this does not mean introducing different boltzmann / gibbs `` thermometers '' , but different relationships between the _ measured _ temperature @xmath16 and @xmath5 .",
    "right to point out that @xmath16 is the _ same measured temperature _ , both for boltzmann and for gibbs , we will not speak about boltzmann s or gibbs `` temperature '' ( apart from rare cases ) and will not append any subscript g or b to @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest system for testing the differences between the two entropies and is a non interacting gas of @xmath0 two - level particles , with populations @xmath18 in each level @xmath19 . while boltzmann predicts @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , gibbs predicts @xmath22 increasing continuously up to an inverted population regime @xmath23 at @xmath24 . at this stage",
    "one might wonder why laser devices need a resonant external field , in order to get an overpopulated level , if this could be obtained simply by thermal activation .",
    "the point is that in the gibbs framework , the _ size _ of the gas ( represented by the particle number @xmath0 ) plays a crucial role in determining how high the temperature should be , to achieve a significant overpopulation of the upper level .",
    "this is what we are going to show in the present section .",
    "on setting @xmath25 , the energy of the gas ( as far as the two - level part is concerned ) reads : @xmath26 since the condition @xmath27 implies @xmath28 , gibbs entropy reads : @xmath29\\:.\\ ] ] if @xmath30 , the entropy can be expressed in an integral form , making use of stirling formula for the factorials :    [ sg1,phi , z ] @xmath31\\:,\\ ] ] with @xmath32\\ ] ] and @xmath33=\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\phi(z)+\\underbrace{\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{1+z}{1-z}\\right)}_{a(z)}(x - z)+\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{1-z^2}}_{b(z)}(x - z)^2+\\dots \\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the series expansion in eq.n   will be used in appendix a. the temperature follows from eq.n  , on account of eq.ns  : @xmath34 for @xmath30 , the following expressions are derived in appendix a :    [ e < > 0 ] @xmath35^{-1 } & \\text{for } e<0,\\ ; |e|\\gg\\epsilon\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}}\\label{e<0}\\\\ & \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi n}{2 } } & \\text{for } e=0 \\label{e=0}\\\\ & \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi n}{2}}\\mathrm{exp}\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\phi\\left(z(e)\\right)\\right]\\times&\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times\\left[1+\\mathrm{erf}\\left(z(e)\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}}\\right)\\right ] & \\text{for } 0<e\\ll\\epsilon\\:n\\label{e>0}\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the condition @xmath36 corresponds to the thermal regime in which the boltzmann temperature @xmath37 is positive and the lower level is always more populated then the higher one .",
    "actually , equation recovers exactly the standard result : @xmath38 as can be easily shown by solving with respect to @xmath39 , then using eq.ns   and .",
    "the differences between boltzmann and gibbs at finite @xmath0 becomes divergingly large in the range of critical energies :    @xmath40    indeed , it is well known that @xmath41 , according to boltzmann , for any value of @xmath0 ( see , for instance , fig . 1 in ref .",
    "in contrast , equation   shows that @xmath42 is _ finite _ , but diverging with @xmath43 , according to gibbs .",
    "the @xmath14-discrepancy between boltzmann and gibbs is expressed by the ratio @xmath44 , between the range of critical energies ( eq.n  ) and the total energy range .",
    "note that the condition @xmath45 corresponds to what would be the nat regime , that should be attained by `` super heating '' the system above @xmath46 , according to boltzmann s picture .    from a formal viewpoint ,",
    "the results eq.ns  , obtained in the gibbs framework , cure the singularity of the boltzmann temperature at @xmath46 and bring the gas continuously to any positive value of the energy , i.e. , to any _ thermally activated _ overpopulation of the upper level .",
    "however , it is easily shown from eq.n   that the temperature diverges _ exponentially _ with @xmath0 , for @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , while the crossing temperature    .**the logarithmic plot shows the exponential increase of @xmath16 in the particle number @xmath0 , for different _ positive _ values of @xmath47 , corresponding to a _ thermally activated _ overpopulation of the upper level.,width=384 ]    @xmath48    at @xmath46 ( eq.n  ) , diverges with the square root of the system size .",
    "hence , the regime @xmath45 would be unaccessible to any _ thermal _ process , for @xmath49 , even in the gibbs framework . in this ( non trivial ) sense gibbs and boltzmann",
    "do converge to the same results in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , in a finite - size system , the regime @xmath45 ( or , equivalently , @xmath50 ) is not forbidden in principle , according to gibbs , and could be accessed by an appropriate experimental set up .",
    "this is what we are going to exploit in what follows .",
    "let us derive an expression for @xmath47 as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath0 , recalling that @xmath47 ( eq.n  ) is the fractional difference between the higher and lower level populations .",
    "assuming @xmath51 , which means @xmath52 , and defining @xmath53 , equation   yields : @xmath54^{1/2}\\;\\rightarrow\\ ; z\\approx\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{t}{t_g}\\right)}\\quad(t>2\\:t_g)\\:,\\ ] ] since @xmath55 ranges between @xmath56 and @xmath57 and does not affect",
    "the result significantly ensures that the quantity in square root is positive , for any value of @xmath58 , but the solution of the equation exists for any @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 does _ not _ imply @xmath61 . ] . at fixed temperature @xmath16 ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the overpopulation factor @xmath47 decreases with the square root of the system size . due to the logarithmic dependence ,",
    "the value of @xmath47 is almost insensitive to @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the feasibility of an experiment possibly measuring @xmath50 at a _ positive _ temperature rests on two main difficulties : first , a crossing temperature @xmath63 not so large as to prevent high precision measurements ; second , an overpopulation factor @xmath64 not so small as to escape the instrumental sensitivity .    consider a gas of @xmath0 atoms of @xmath65 , in a volume @xmath66 , each carrying a spin magnetic moment @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be an external uniform magnetic field . from eq.n  ,",
    "the total induced moment @xmath69 reads , according to gibbs :    @xmath70    while boltzmann ( eq.n   with @xmath71 ) yields : @xmath72    with @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath74 is _ antiparallel _ and @xmath75 _ parallel _ to @xmath68 , since the former comes from the overpopulation of the upper level , while the latter comes from the overpopulation of the lower one .",
    "squid magnetometers , that are the highest sensitivity instruments currently available , can measure magnetic moment intensities down to @xmath76 .",
    "for @xmath16 larger than , but comparable to @xmath77 , the condition @xmath78 ( eq.n  ) yields the order of magnitude @xmath79 for the minimum number of atoms required to produce a detectable value of @xmath74 .",
    "efficient squid devices usually operate at temperatures of @xmath80 at most , which determines an upper limit for @xmath77 . from eq.n  , however , this turns into an upper limit for @xmath81 with those values of @xmath0 , @xmath68 and @xmath16 , one sees that @xmath82 ( eq.n  ) is comparable in magnitude to @xmath83 , so that the measurable difference between boltzmann s and gibbs predictions results mainly in the _ opposite _ orientation of a small induced magnetic moment .",
    "this effect is @xmath14-small because the _ antiparallel _ induced magnetic moment @xmath84 increases as @xmath43 ( eq.n  ) , while the _ parallel _ induced moment @xmath85 is proportional to @xmath0 ( eq.n  ) .    as for the volume @xmath66 of the gas , one should recall that the size of the sample does also play a role , in the feasibility of the experiment .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath86 , corresponding to a density of @xmath87 of @xmath88 atoms , at @xmath89 , yields degeneration effects less than @xmath90 .",
    "this looks a still tolerable error factor for the implicit approximation assumed so far , that the two - level energy is statistically independent from the translational energy ( which is false , for degenerate gases ) .    in conclusion , some cube centimeters of @xmath88 , with density about @xmath87 , at a temperature about @xmath80 , under the action of a magnetic field of @xmath91 , could be a good candidate as a referee of the boltzmann _ vs _ gibbs match . if the measured magnetic moment ( spin polarization ) of the gas , induced by the field , were _",
    "anti - parallel _ to the field itself , the resulting _ thermally activated _ overpopulation of the upper level would provide a strong experimental support to gibbs definition of entropy . on suitably changing the experimental set up , the hypothesis that gibbs and boltzmann s entropies do refer to different constraints ( microcanonic or canonic ) could be exploited in turn .",
    "another system for testing the consequences of gibb s definition of entropy is a ferromagnetic material , modeled by an ising lattice of @xmath92 interacting magnetic moments with only `` up '' ( @xmath93 ) and `` down '' ( @xmath94 ) orientations . in this case one",
    "has to face the problem of applying gibbs picture to a phase transition ( paramagnetic @xmath95 ferromagnetic ) , which turns out to be a non trivial issue .    in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the energy of the ising model reads : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is half the coupling constant of the moment - moment interaction , @xmath47 is the magnetization and @xmath98 is the energy contribute from an external uniform magnetic field , in units of @xmath99 .",

    "let the external magnetic field vanish ( @xmath110 ) . on applying eq.n   to eq.ns   and , the relationship between gibbs temperature and the relative magnetization intensity @xmath106 is shown by the full line in fig .",
    "the dashed line , instead , refers to boltzmann s temperature . the right side of fig .",
    "2 shows that both @xmath16-curves initially increase with decreasing @xmath106 , which is what one expects for a ferromagnet whose spontaneous magnetic order tends to be destroyed by an increasing thermal disorder .",

    "it is clear that the `` states '' @xmath129 are spurious and that the range of values @xmath130 in fig .",
    "2 is unphysical in some sense .",
    "here we suggest an argument that provides a plane interpretation of fig . 2 , but challenges the position that gibbs entropy and temperature refers to _ microcanonical _ systems only , while boltzmann s picture refers to _ canonical _ systems . and",

    "@xcite ) , add a new element of discussion , by refreshing an almost forgotten definition of entropy , due to gibbs ( eq.n  ) , that forbids negative absolute temperature ( nat ) , in contrast to the current expression  , usually attributed to boltzmann . the arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite have raised a discussion on the validity of eq.n  , as an alternative to eq.n   @xcite .",
    "the two expressions differ in the phase space regions uniformly occupied by the system : a surface of constant energy @xmath13 , for boltzmann ; a volume containing _ all _ states with energy less than @xmath13 , for gibbs .",
    "while boltzmann s definition can not apply but to an isolated , micro - canonical system , gibbs entropy seems more appropriate for _ canonical _ systems , whose energy can fluctuate , due to the heat exchanges with a thermal bath .",
    "this , however , contrasts with what is claimed in ref.s  @xcite .",
    "hence , in addition to the question about which of the two expressions is correct , one should also explore the possibility that _ both _ expressions are correct , but refer , respectively , to micro - canonical and canonical constraints ( as stressed in ref.s  @xcite ) , or _",
    "vice versa_.    since gibbs and boltzmann entropies yield the same results in the thermodynamical limit @xmath49 , any possible _ measurable _ consequence of what precedes results in a _ size effect _ and is thereby far from easy to exploit . a superficial reading of eq.n ( 14 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite might lead to the conclusion that the smallness of the differences between eq.n   and vanish as @xmath2 ( the inverse of an _ extensive _ quantity like the heat capacity ) .",
    "if so , any experimental test , such as the `` minimal quantum thermometer '' suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , would become extremely difficult , if not impossible .",
    "the aim of the present work was to explore the possibility of concrete experimental procedures , deciding the winner ( if any ) of what we playfully called the boltzmann _ vs _ gibbs match , or claiming that the two opponents actually play on different playgrounds , if boltzmann and gibbs entropies would result to refer to different constraints .",
    "the study of two - level systems , both in the form of gases ( section  [ 2levgas ] ) , and of interacting ising spins ( sections  [ weiss ] and appendix b ) , shows that the smallness factor to be accounted for is not @xmath2 , but @xmath14 , which makes any experimental procedure much more feasible . in particular , it has been seen that some cube centimeters of @xmath88 , with density about @xmath87 , at a temperature of tens kelvins , under the action of a magnetic field of @xmath91 , could be an appropriate system for an experimental test , possibly revealing the most striking effect of gibbs entropy , i.e. a _ thermally activated _ overpopulation of the upper level . as a possible alternative",
    ", it is found that the effect supporting gibbs entropy in a weiss ferromagnet ( ising model ) should be a divergent heat capacity at a critical temperature @xmath113 ( lower than the standard curie temperature ) , in contrast to the finite discontinuity predicted by boltzmann s picture at the curie temperature @xmath114 ( figure 3 ) . in a _",
    "canonical _ process ( section  [ weiss2 ] ) , gibbs entropy would be also responsible for an anomalous persistence of the paramagnetic regime , below the critical temperature @xmath113 , that should be destabilized by an external magnetic field proportional to @xmath14 ( eq.n  ) .",
    "this should be observed in canonical sub - millimetric metallic particles , with controllable number of interacting magnetic moments , under the action of weak external magnetic fields ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "the orders of magnitude involved in the measurements sketched above look fairly accessible to concrete experiments , which opens the possibility of an important advance in the thermodynamics of small systems , and in the genuine foundations of statistical thermodynamics . +",
    "* post - amble *    as anticipated in the preamble , now i try to explain the reasons that lead one of the referees to reject the publication in _",
    "pre_.    the referee denies that equation  , which is the cornerstone of all the question , is actually equivalent to the minimization of the helmholtz free energy @xmath171 with respect to , say , the magnetization ( or any other state parameter ) , at fixed @xmath66 and @xmath16 .",
    "the referee claims that , while this is true for boltzmann s entropy , it might be false for gibbs entropy ( giving no counter - example , however ) . in the lack of a first principle statistical derivation , says the referee , the minimization of @xmath171 is an _",
    "ad hoc _ procedure , and any result supporting it might be a pure coincidence .    as shown by what precedes ,",
    "my point is that equation   is manifestly equivalent to find the _ extremants _ of @xmath171 , which is nothing but a mathematical outcome .",
    "on using just equation   ( and nothing else ) , i show that , in the case of weiss ferromagnetism , some of those extremants behave as true thermal equilibrium values , while others behave like _ non equilibrium _ values ( see fig.2 ) , yielding , for example , a _ negative _ heat capacity . of course ,",
    "the good@xmath172extremants and the bad@xmath172ones are the minima and the maxima of @xmath171 , respectively ( see fig.s 5 ) . as far as i can see , the only problem with this picture is the _ opinion _ , shared by many gibbs supporters , that gibbs entropy should apply to _ microcanonical _ systems only .",
    "if so , the notion of helmholtz free energy is questionable , since it is well known that minimizing @xmath171 is a _",
    "canonical _ equilibrium procedure .",
    "this is aknowledged as a possible pending question to be explored , hopefully experimentally , which is right the aim of the present work : suggesting experimental tests to check the validity of two contrasting definitions of the entropy .",
    "paradoxically , the efforts made in the ( vain ) attempt to remove the referee s objections turned into some advantages . thank to them , indeed , the work has been considerably improved . for example , the divergency of @xmath126 at @xmath113 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , that is an important physical aspect , had escaped to my attention in the first version .",
    "for @xmath30 , the contributes to the integral @xmath173}\\mathrm{d}x\\ ] ] in eq.n   come from the minimum of @xmath174 ( positive and symmetric ) in the integration interval @xmath175 $ ] .",
    "so , @xmath174 can be approximated by the first three terms in eq.n  , which yields :        if @xmath36 , one has @xmath178 in turn ( eq.n  ) and @xmath179 .",
    "if @xmath180 is large , @xmath181 can be neglected in the exponent of the integrand in eq.n  , which yields : @xmath182 on replacing expression in eq.n  , one gets eq.n  , with the same validity condition ( recall eq.ns   and ) .    if @xmath45 ( @xmath183 ) , the integral in eq.n   can be calculated by completing the square in the exponent : @xmath184\\:.\\ ] ]",
    "if , in particular , one takes @xmath60 , equations  , and lead to the expression in eq.n  .",
