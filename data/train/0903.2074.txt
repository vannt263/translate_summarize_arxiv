    "observations show that the mode frequencies change with the solar cycle and the correlation between the frequencies and solar activity measured by different proxies is solar cycle phase dependent ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "there is also an indication that the correlation between frequency and activity depends on the length of the observation due to the finite lifetime of the modes @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the relation between mode frequencies and other mode parameters with solar activity on different time scales . with this objective ,",
    "we have analyzed the global oscillation network group ( gong ) time series data by splitting it into segments of length 9 , 36 , 72 and 108 days .",
    "the gong data analyzed here cover the period between 7 may 1995 and 31 august 2007 and consist of 125 sets of time series of length 36 days .",
    "these are processed with a multi - taper spectral method to produce power spectra @xcite .",
    "the mode frequencies and other mode parameters are estimated by fitting the individual peaks @xcite ; not all modes are fitted successfully at every epoch due to the stochastic excitation nature of the modes . in this paper , we concentrate on the behavior of individual modes rather than the average quantities .",
    "although each data set has a large number of multiplets , only 19 multiplets are found to be common to all of the data sets and have an inner turning point half - way between the tachocline and solar surface .",
    "these multiplets cover a frequency ( @xmath0 ) range of 2138  3362  @xmath1hz and degree ( @xmath2 ) range between 50 and 81 .",
    "the mode parameters are correlated with four well known surface activity indicators : the integrated radio flux at 10.7 cm ( @xmath3 ) obtained from solar geophysical data ( sgd ) , magnetic plage strength index ( mpsi ) from mt .",
    "wilson magnetograms @xcite , the international sunspot number ( @xmath4 ) obtained from sgd and mg ii core - to - wing ratio @xcite",
    "figure  1(a ) shows the temporal evolution of frequency shifts corresponding to the @xmath5  =  8 , @xmath2  =  72 multiplet with respect to the average frequency of the mode ; different symbols correspond to time series of different lengths .",
    "a distinct temporal variation depicting the solar activity cycle is easily observed in each data sets .",
    "although the modes are well resolved in the 9-day time samples , a large scatter is seen for the frequencies , probably due to the lower frequency resolution and broader line widths .",
    "figure  1(b ) demonstrates the linear relationship between the frequency shifts and 10.7  cm radio flux measurements .    as an example of the relation between the frequency shifts and activity indices",
    ", the left panel of figure  2 shows the correlation coefficients for four different multiplets as a function of the length of the time series .",
    "for all of the activity indices considered here , the correlation improves with the length but the nature of the increase is significantly different for different multiplets .",
    "for example the @xmath5  =  8 , @xmath2  =  81 multiplet shows a steep increase in correlation from 9 to 108 days while for the @xmath5  =  8 , @xmath2  =  63 multiplet , the correlation flattens after 36 days .",
    "the variations of the slope as a function of the correlation coefficients for different data sets are shown in the right panel of figure  2 .",
    "each point in the figure represents a common multiplet .",
    "we find that the correlation and slopes are correlated and both increase from 9 days to 108 days .",
    "however , our earlier studies @xcite involving average frequency shifts had shown that the slopes obtained from 9 days are higher than those from 108 days .",
    "thus , the behavior of individual modes appear to be different from their average quantities .",
    "we correct the mode amplitudes and line widths for gaps in the temporal window function and then combine them to estimate the mode energy ( @xmath6 ) and energy supply rate ( @xmath7 ) assuming stochastic excitation @xcite",
    ". the temporal evolution of these parameters for the @xmath5  =  8 , @xmath2  =  72 multiplet is shown in figure  3 . as discussed in @xcite , the plots demonstrate an annual modulation .",
    "we further observe that the energy of the mode ( fig .",
    "3a ) is anti - correlated with solar activity with correlation coefficients of @xmath80.62 , @xmath80.83 , @xmath80.86 , and @xmath80.90 with @xmath3 for 9 to 108  days respectively .",
    "this again demonstrates that the correlation increases with the length of the time series . on the other hand , the energy supply rate ( fig .",
    "3b ) shows only short - term variations and no apparent correlation with the solar activity cycle .",
    "these general behaviors are consistent with those reported by @xcite for the low - degree modes .",
    "further , we also note differences between energy and energy supply rate obtained from time series of different lengths ; the values are higher for shorter time series . similar to the mode frequency",
    ", it is also possible that different modes may behave differently and as a result the average behavior may be different than for individual multiplets .",
    "analyzing mode parameters of individual multiplets for data sets of different lengths , we find that the slope and linear correlation coefficients between mode frequencies and activity indicators increases with the length of the time series . in all cases ,",
    "the slopes are found to be correlated with the correlation coefficients .",
    "we also observe that the mode energy decreases with increase in solar activity while the energy supply rate is approximately constant over the entire solar cycle ; the values of these parameters are progressively higher for shorter time series .",
    "the study also indicated that the behavior of individual modes may be different from their average behavior .",
    "additional work is in progress to confirm these findings .",
    "this work utilizes data obtained by the global oscillation network group program , managed by the national solar observatory , which is operated by aura , inc . under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "the data were acquired by instruments operated by the big bear solar observatory , high altitude observatory , learmonth solar observatory , udaipur solar observatory , instituto de astrofsica de canarias , and cerro tololo interamerican observatory .",
