    "dynein is a motor protein that moves on a microtubule filament to participate in certain activities inside a cell such as transport of vesicles , cell division etc @xcite .",
    "dynein moves toward the negative end of the microtubule and this feature is used by the cell , e.g. , for the transport or aggregation of cellular organelles toward the nucleus of the cell . based on their activities ,",
    "dynein molecules are classified into two groups namely axonemal dynein and cytoplasmic dynein . of these two ,",
    "the axonemal dyneins work together in groups to produce rhythmic motions of cilia and flagella .",
    "the cytoplasmic dynein , in which we are interested , perform , either in group or alone , the job of transport of cargoes such as cytoplasmic vesicles , chromosomes etc along the microtubule filaments . besides these dyneins",
    ", there are other kinds of motor proteins such as kinesin and myosin which are microtubule positive end directed and actin filament based respectively .",
    "these motor molecules also perform similar jobs as dynein . however , in comparison with these motors , dynein molecules are exceptionally large and complex .",
    "roughly , the dynein molecule consists of two to three heavy chain units each of which has a globular head domain ( approximately @xmath0 nm diameter ) with special sites capable of atp hydrolysis , and two elongated structures known as stalk and tail .",
    "the stalk and the tail bind the microtubule and the cargo respectively . because of the size , and also the difficulties in expressing and purifying the mutants , the progress in understanding the mechanism of dynein s motion @xcite is slow .    in general , the movement of a motor molecule takes place in the following way .",
    "the adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) molecule , which diffuses in the solution inside the cell , can get attached to specific regions or active sites in motor s head .",
    "the motor molecule is capable of catalyzing a decomposition(hydrolysis ) of this atp into adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) , inorganic phosphate ( @xmath1 ) and a significant amount of energy .",
    "this energy so released causes a conformational change in the molecule resulting in a motion relative to the microtubule .",
    "this process of hydrolysis repeats if the atp concentration is sufficiently high and the motor molecule moves forward . in the case of dynein ,",
    "the head domain consists of several sites at which atp binding / unbinding or hydrolysis may take place .",
    "although the details of the functional roles of these sites are still under investigation , it is believed that these sites are capable of controlling / regulating the motion of the dynein molecule .",
    "since the activities of motor proteins are force driven , it is important to know the response of the motion of the motor molecule to an externally applied force .",
    "the force generated by a motor molecule can be measured in single molecule experiments .",
    "for example , in optical trap experiments , a motor molecule is attached to a polysterene bead which acts as a probe to monitor the movement of the motor molecule .",
    "the force on the bead due to the motor molecule is counteracted by a controlled backward force from the optical trap .",
    "the bead stays immobile if the backward force is strong enough to resist the force generated by the motor .",
    "the minimum force needed to hold the bead immobile is the stall force which is a measure of the force generated by the molecule . an applied force , f , can affect the velocity in the following way .",
    "in general , a motor molecule moves due to the internal conformational changes and these conformational changes occur due to the events such as atp attachment or detachment and atp hydrolysis .",
    "the process of atp attachment is also dependent on the concentration of the atp molecules inside the cell .",
    "these events take place with certain probabilities which determine their average rates .",
    "the external force may give rise to internal deformations because of which the atp attachment or detachment rate and the hydrolysis rate change thereby changing the average velocity , @xmath2 , of the molecule .",
    "thus , studying the force - velocity relationship both theoretically and experimentally is crucial for predicting how exactly various processes are affected by the force .",
    "in addition to this systematic force , there can be thermal noise which also affects the velocity of dynein by changing different rate constants . in case of such a stochastic displacement of the molecule , it is possible to define an effective diffusion constant @xmath3/(2 t)$ ] which is a measure of the fluctuation in the displacement . here",
    ", @xmath4 denotes the statistical average . in terms of this diffusion constant",
    ", one can also define a natural time scale @xmath5 which is the time required for the molecule to diffuse a natural length scale , @xmath6 .",
    "the distance traveled during this time due to the drift velocity @xmath2 is @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio of these two distances is often referred as the randomness parameter @xcite @xmath8 this parameter derived earlier for kinesin has been found useful for understanding the internal mechanism of the molecule .    from the structural studies of dynein",
    ", it is believed that the dynein based transport in the cell is quite different and robust in comparison with other motors . however , experimentally , the mechanism of dynein s function is not yet fully understood .",
    "for example , a recent experiment @xcite that demonstrates @xmath9 nm step size for a cytoplasmic dynein contradicts an earlier observation @xcite that the step size of dynein increases from @xmath9 nm to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 nm as the strength of the applied force reduces .",
    "various step lengths found in @xcite are multiples of a unit step size @xmath13 nm , that corresponds to a certain periodicity of the microtubule filament .",
    "in addition , the results of @xcite on the average velocity of dynein and the value of the stall force are significantly different from those of reference @xcite .",
    "single molecule experiment on axonemal dyneins has also demonstrated step - wise displacements of @xmath9 nm size @xcite . in view of these differences , a theoretical model , that can take into account the wide step size variation of the molecule and can predict how , in this case , the velocity depends on the applied force , appears meaningful . in addition",
    ", this analysis , which is going to be based on several assumptions on how various sites in dynein s head participate in regulating the motion , is expected to help explain the mysterious roles of these sites . although some theoretical work has been done to understand various activities of dynein such as rhythmic beating of axonemal dyneins @xcite , unidirectional motion of dyneins @xcite , geared motion of dynein to explain its force dependent step size @xcite , so far there has been no analytical approach to understand how the variable step size can affect the average velocity .    based on the recent structural observation , we propose a model in which one can incorporate @xmath9 nm and other longer jumps and study how this wide variation of the step size affects the average velocity . in case of variations in the step size , one needs to do a detailed fluctuation analysis to obtain the distributions of the step - length and the number of steps in a given time .",
    "the definition of the randomness parameter in eq .",
    "[ rand ] , therefore , needs to be modified appropriately , possibly , by the inclusion of an average step length .",
    "however , in terms of @xmath6 as the smallest step , the randomness parameter helps us observe how the step size variation affects the fluctuation in the displacement of the molecule .",
    "although , for simplicity , we include only a few essential structural and mechanochemical details @xcite , the model is flexible enough to incorporate other details .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the basic assumptions based on which the model is built .",
    "the analysis of the model is presented in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "this section is divided into two subsections as we consider different variants of the model by including longer jumps of the dynein molecule .",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary of the work in section iv .",
    "it is known that the dyenin s head domain consists of six sub - domains of aaa family of proteins arranged in the form of a ring around a central cavity @xcite . out of these aaa sub - domains ,",
    "only four are capable of atp binding with varying binding affinities @xcite .",
    "atpase activities of these different aaa sub - domains are subjects of experimental investigations . although aaa1 is believed to be the primary site of atp hydrolysis which powers the motion of the molecule , recent experimental observations support hydrolytic activities of other aaa sub - domains @xcite .",
    "some of the studies elucidating the functional roles of the aaa - sub - domains indicate that other aaa sub - domains may play various regulatory roles by altering the hydrolysis of the primary site and subsequently affecting the molecular function , or by modulating the efficiency of the coupling between the microtubule binding site and the primary site @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we call the sub - domains aaa2-aaa4 as secondary sites .    in view of the inherent complexity of dynein and our evolving understanding of how various components of the molecule function",
    ", it appears worthwhile to propose a model with the following assumptions .",
    "\\1 . for our entire analysis",
    ", we assume the dynein molecule to be effectively single headed @xcite .",
    "studies on head - head coordination @xcite during the processive movement of dynein suggest that similar to kinesin and myosin , the rear head of dynein may sense a pulling force from the forward head and this force may modulate the kinetic steps appropriately to coordinate the forward motion .",
    "the hydrolysis presumably takes place alternatively in each head and at a given step a single head proceeds forward in a hand - over - hand fashion . since these details of the head coordination is not an issue here , both the heads",
    "can be thought of as a composite object - a single head .",
    "the effect of the pulling force in the atpase activities of the head is assumed to be incorporated through the rates .",
    "the two - head problem can be studied if additional information is known about how the force exactly modulates the kinetic steps in the head .",
    "we assume that there are only two atp binding sites ( sub - domains ) of which one is a primary site ( p ) and the other one is a secondary site ( s ) .",
    "this is modified later by including more number of secondary sites .",
    "\\3 . in our analysis , only the primary site is capable of atp hydrolysis .",
    "it is possible to incorporate hydrolytic activities of other secondary sites considering that such additional hydrolysis may change the driving force or the regulatory mechanism of dynein .",
    "we plan to consider these processes in our future analysis elsewhere .",
    "rates of binding or unbinding of atp to or from the primary site are denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 respectively .",
    "subscripts 2 and 3 with these rates imply binding or unbinding processes at the secondary sites . it is assumed that the primary site has the highest affinity to the atp molecule .",
    "therefore , if the primary site is empty , it first gets filled even in the presence of an empty secondary site .",
    "similarly , atp unbinding from the primary site does not take place if there are occupied secondary sites .",
    "these rules hold throughout the entire analysis .",
    "\\5 . to start with",
    ", it is assumed that atp hydrolysis at the primary site causes the dynein to jump the smallest distance @xmath13 nm .",
    "this can be modified further .",
    "the distance , a dynein molecule can jump after a hydrolysis can change depending on whether the secondary site is occupied or unoccupied .",
    "if the secondary site is occupied , the dynein molecule jumps a distance @xmath6 after a hydrolysis . in case",
    "the secondary site is unoccupied , the dynein molecule moves @xmath16 distance ahead at a time after a hydrolysis . in the presence of two secondary sites ,",
    "the dynein can jump @xmath17 distance at a time after one hydrolysis if both secondary sites are empty .",
    "jumps of length @xmath18 or @xmath6 are possible if one or both the secondary sites are occupied respectively . the hydrolysis processes , that trigger jumps of length @xmath6 , @xmath18 or @xmath17 , take place at rates @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . a schematic diagram , indicating various moves described here , is presented in figure 1 .    .",
    "( a ) a jump by a distance @xmath6 always .",
    "the dynein molecule is assumed to have two active aaa sub - domains .",
    "( b ) the molecule jumps a distance @xmath6 ( or @xmath18 ) when the secondary site is in an atp - bound(or unbound ) state .",
    "the dynein molecule has two active aaa - sub - domains .",
    "this case has been discussed in section [ sec : twostep ] .",
    "( c ) three possible moves of lengths @xmath6 , @xmath18 and @xmath17 depending on the number of atp - bound secondary sites .",
    "the dynein molecule has three active aaa sub - domains .",
    "this case has been discussed in section [ sec : threesite].,width=288 ]    \\6 .",
    "our analysis is based on the assumption that the time required for a transition is much smaller than the time between two successive transitions .",
    "in addition , we also assume that the thermal relaxation of the molecule after a transition is much faster compared to the transition rate @xcite .",
    "this allows us to assume quasi - equilibrium for transitions from one state to the other over various free energy barriers . at temperature t ,",
    "the rate constants are , therefore , expected to depend exponentially on @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is an appropriate parameter in the units of length and @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "our next assumption is related to the explicit dependences of various rate constants on the load .",
    "it is expected that the mechanochemical cycle is affected by applied load , in particular , since we know that the motion of the motor comes to a halt when the applied opposing force is sufficiently high .",
    "one way of implementing this load dependence is by considering a load dependent hydrolysis rate as @xmath25,\\label{catrate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the distance , the molecule jumps after the hydrolysis .",

    ", it is more intuitive to assume @xmath29 to be positive since the hydrolysis rate should decrease with the increase in the opposing external force .",
    "there exists , however , one restriction on @xmath29 that the sum of the load distribution factors for hydrolysis and reverse hydrolysis should be unity .",
    "the possibilities of reverse hydrolysis is not taken into account in order to appreciate the crucial features of the results when the number of parameters is less .",
    "atp hydrolysis is assumed to be enhanced if at least one secondary site binds atp .",
    "this is taken care of by @xmath30 which is @xmath31 if the secondary site is atp - bound and is equal to @xmath32 otherwise . in case of jumps by only a distance @xmath6 , we have only one hydrolysis rate @xmath19 irrespective of whether the secondary site is occupied or unoccupied by an atp molecule . in this case , @xmath33 always . in case of jumps by distance @xmath6 or @xmath18",
    ", we choose the values of @xmath30 as prescribed here .",
    "as has been proposed earlier @xcite , we also assume that the atp binding affinities of the secondary sites are dependent on the load as @xmath34,\\label{kon2 } \\label{bindaff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is an adjustable parameter in the units of length . for obtaining all the results , we use the value @xmath35 same as that in reference @xcite .",
    "the forward motion can be described through equations that describe time evolutions of certain variables on a one - dimensional lattice .",

    "the time evolution equations for all the variables , say , @xmath41 for a molecule with two atpase sites , can be combined into a matrix equation .",

    "this equation can further be recast as a matrix equation describing the time evolution of the column matrix @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is an arbitrary parameter and as we shall discuss below , the determination of the average velocity requires @xmath44 to be unity .    in the following subsection , we discuss the specific case where the molecule jumps by a distance @xmath6 only irrespective of the atp occupancy state of the secondary site .",

    "one of the more recent experiments , however , demonstrates a fixed , load - independent step size close to @xmath9 nm and different results regarding the value of the stall force and its dependence on the atp concentration .",
    "since these experiments give different views about the step length and other properties of dynein , we propose our theoretical model to see the effect of step size variation on the average velocity of the molecule and the fluctuation in its displacement .",
    "our model is based on certain simplifications .",
    "we assume that the head domain has a primary site which is primarily responsible for atp hydrolysis that drives the motion and a maximum of two secondary sites which can regulate the motion through atp binding .",
    "the force induced reduction of the step size is introduced through the assumption that the opposing force increases the binding affinity of the secondary site and the molecule makes a shorter jump if more number of secondary sites are in atp bound states . through this model ,",
    "it is possible to understand analytically how the velocity changes as longer jumps are introduced in dynein s motion at a given atp concentration . at low atp",
    ", we find an initial increase in the velocity with the force before it finally decreases .",
    "this increase in the velocity is not seen at high atp concentrations .",
    "it appears that this increase is partly due to the force dependent binding affinity of the secondary sites .",
    "we also study the randomness parameter , introduced in eq .",
    "this quantity gives an estimate of the variation of the fluctuation in the displacement with the applied opposing force .",
    "the possibility of larger jumps under low - load condition , introduces significant changes in the randomness parameter in the low - force regime .",
    "the model presented here neglects certain features such as the presence of two heads of dynein instead of only one as it is presently simplified to , three secondary sites capable of rendering further drive or regulation through additional hydrolysis or atp binding and the possibility of reverse hydrolysis .",
    "the mechanochemical cycle is also oversimplified in our model . despite these , we believe that predictions from our analysis can be tested through carefully designed experiments as they would provide an an indirect verification of the crucial assumptions set in the model such as the increase in atp binding affinity of the secondary sites with increasing load , dependence of the step - size of the molecule on the number of atp bound secondary sites .",
    "the analytical approach gives explicit expressions of the velocity and the fluctuation in the displacement in terms of various rate constants and one can also isolate the contributions of different secondary sites .",
    "we , therefore , believe that the use of site directed mutants that specifically inhibit the atpase activity of different aaa sub - domains , together with other biochemical tools and single molecule experiments may be required to isolate the contributions of the secondary sites .",
    "the experimental knowledge thus generated regarding the roles of different secondary sites in powering or regulating the motion of the molecule will make it possible to further modify the model suitably .",
    "the model presented here is a first phenomenological step toward understanding the complete molecular model of dynein .",
