    "compact remnants of massive stars in star clusters , which are neutron stars ( ns ) and black holes ( bh ) , form a dynamically interesting sub - population due to their tendency of segregating towards the cluster s center and augmenting their population density therein . in this respect ,",
    "the bhs are special in that they undergo a `` runaway '' mass segregation .",
    "these remnant bhs are typically several 10s of @xmath0 heavy , enough to form a spitzer - unstable sub - system , provided a significant number of them are retained in their parent cluster . due to this instability (",
    "also called the mass - stratification instability , @xcite ) , the continually sinking bhs can not come to an energy equipartition with the local surrounding stars and finally end - up in a central , highly concentrated sub - cluster made purely of bhs , which is self - gravitating and dynamically nearly isolated from the rest of the stellar cluster @xcite .",
    "such a dense environment of bhs is dynamically very active due to the formation of bh - bh binaries via 3-body encounters @xcite and their hardening by super - elastic encounters @xcite with their surrounding bhs .",
    "studies of the dynamics of pure bh sub - clusters using monte - carlo and direct n - body integration methods indicate that the dynamical bh - bh merger events they generate are likely to contribute a significant gravitational wave ( gw ) detection rate to the future `` advanced ligo '' ( adligo ) and `` lisa '' gw observatories @xcite .",
    "such studies show that a bh sub - cluster is typically self - depleted in a few gyr due to the super - elastic dynamical encounters and the resulting escape of the bhs @xcite .",
    "the energy extracted from the tight bh - bh binaries heats - up and expands the cluster s core @xcite , which can be detectable by the future optical missions such as the `` gaia '' mission .",
    "furthermore , the bhs can be important for dynamically formed bh x - ray sources due to their encounters with the surrounding stars @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations have indicated the presence of bh x - ray binary candidates in gcs @xcite .",
    "the presence of a bh sub - cluster within a star cluster , therefore , has the potential to give rise to a plethora of physical phenomena , all of which have significance to upcoming prime missions such as the gaia , adligo and the present and future x - ray missions .",
    "is it possible to obtain any direct observational signature of the presence of a bh sub - cluster within a star cluster ?",
    "we predict here , for the first time , that within a few kpc from the galactic center , rapid tidal stripping of star clusters by the strong tidal field can expose its bh sub - cluster .",
    "this would happen when the timescale of the preferential removal of stars from the outer regions of the cluster is shorter or comparable to the encounter - driven self - depletion timescale of its central bh sub - cluster ( see above ) .",
    "such a dissolved phase of the cluster would consist of a few stars orbiting around a cluster of bhs and would observationally appear as a highly super - virial star cluster with a large mass - to - light - ratio .    as we discuss here",
    ", a number of direct n - body computations of model star clusters indeed support the formation of such systems .",
    "these objects comprise a predicted , new class of compact stellar populations which we name `` dark star clusters '' .",
    "the importance of dark star clusters ( hereafter dsc ) is twofold : on one hand , if they are found to exist , then they guarantee that star clusters are potential sites for gw emission and formation of bh x - ray binaries and on the other hand , they naturally constrain the uncertain natal kicks of bhs @xcite , as dscs can form only if a significant number of bhs retain in the cluster following their progenitor supernovae .",
    "this , in turn , restricts the theoretical models of core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "we compute the evolution of model star clusters subjected to the galactic tidal field using the direct n - body integration method .",
    "for our purposes , we use the state - of - the - art n - body integration code `` nbody6 '' @xcite , which , apart from utilizing a highly sophisticated numerical integration scheme @xcite , also follows the evolution of the individual stars until their remnant phases , using an analytic but well - tested stellar evolution recipe @xcite .",
    "a unique feature of nbody6 is its use of highly accurate regularization methods in resolving close encounters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the code exploits the remarkable hardware - accelerated computing capacity of graphical processing units ( gpus ) in integrating the centers of masses .",
    "nbody6 currently incorporates general - relativistic effects only through analytic prescriptions of gw energy - loss .",
    "we follow the evolution of initial plummer clusters @xcite of single stars , having masses between @xmath1 and half - mass radii between @xmath2 .",
    "all the clusters initially consist of zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) stars with their masses @xmath3 chosen from the canonical initial mass function ( imf ; @xcite ) @xmath4 , where @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( salpeter index ) for @xmath8 .",
    "their metallicities are chosen to be solar , as suitable for our galaxy s disk .",
    "we assume for now that all the supernova remnants ( _ i.e. _ , bhs and nss ) receive low natal kicks in general such that they remain bound to their parent clusters at their formation .",
    "such models follow circular orbit around a point mass of @xmath9 representing the milky way bulge .",
    "[ fig : qevol ] ( top panel ) shows an example of the evolution of the virial coefficient for one of our computed model clusters with initially @xmath10 stars and @xmath11 pc , located at @xmath12 kpc galactocentric distance .",
    "the orange curve shows the time - evolution of the virial coefficient , @xmath13 , for all the members bound to the cluster including the bhs and the nss , which mostly remains constant at @xmath14 , as it should be for the quasi - static relaxation of a self - gravitating system through two - body encounters @xcite .    the green curve in fig .  [ fig : qevol ] ( top ) shows the time - evolution of the virial coefficient taking into account only the luminous objects , _",
    "i.e. _ , the nuclear burning stars and the white dwarfs ( hereafter wd ) , which are those an observer sees .",
    "the bhs formed have masses @xmath15 and the nss are typically of @xmath16 , which are significantly more massive than the majority of the remaining luminous members and hence are segregated to the cluster s center . as the lower mass luminous stars in the outer regions",
    "are stripped by the external field , the gravitational potential of these central invisible remnants becomes increasingly important .",
    "therefore , the kinetic energy of the luminous sub - system increasingly exceeds the corresponding self - equilibrium ( or quasi - static ) value as the constituents perceive a potential that becomes increasingly deeper than their self - potential .",
    "this correspondingly raises their exclusive virial coefficient , @xmath17 , above 0.5 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : qevol ] ( top panel , green curve ) .",
    "the cluster thus evolves to a dsc state ( see sec .",
    "[ dcpop ] ) .",
    "note that while @xmath17 reaches a very high value , the system as a whole remains bound since @xmath18 throughout ( except at the final dissolved state , not shown in the figure ) .",
    "notably , nss form a few factors more often than the bhs and contribute significantly in elevating @xmath17 .",
    "however , the nss being lighter than the bhs , their sub - population occupies a more extended zone in the cluster s center .",
    "this causes them to get stripped earlier than the bhs ( _ c.f . _",
    "[ fig : qevol ] , bottom panel ) so that in the late evolutionary phase , typically when @xmath19 , it is mostly the bh population that contributes to the augmented @xmath17 , thereby determining the lifetime of the dsc phase ( see sec .",
    "[ dcpop ] ) . nevertheless , at large enough distances from the galactic center , where slower tidal stripping causes the dsc phase to appear later than the self - depletion of the bh sub - cluster ( see sec .  [ intro ] ; @xcite ) , the nss constitute the primary dark component of the corresponding dsc state ( see sec .  [ dcpop ] ) .",
    "this self - depletion process , although operative for both the ns and the bh sub - populations , is more efficient for the latter as it is significantly more concentrated .",
    "[ fig : tfram ] ( top ) shows the expected increasing trend in the lifetime of the dscs with initial cluster mass @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the dsc phase can be defined when the cluster appears unbound , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath23 or when it appears significantly super - virial , which we take when @xmath24 , and denote the corresponding lifetimes by @xmath25 with @xmath26 and 0.75 respectively . fig .",
    "[ fig : tfram ] ( bottom ) shows @xmath27 against @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath25 also increases with increasing @xmath28 since the dsc takes a longer time to get depleted in a weaker external field .",
    "notably , for @xmath30 kpc , the dsc state becomes ns - dominated . beyond @xmath31 kpc , it takes more than the age of our galaxy ( @xmath32 gyr ) for the representative cluster to evolve to its dsc phase ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath24 ) .",
    "it then follows that for the present - day galaxy the dscs are formed from clusters with @xmath33 within @xmath34 kpc , to be taken as representative numbers , and have lifetimes @xmath35 myr and @xmath36 myr as conservative estimates .",
    "although these estimates are based on a point - mass tidal field , note that the dscs progenitor clusters form in the galactic disk and orbit on nearly circular paths ( in the equatorial plane ) and hence would experience the same external field with an axisymmetric disk - like distribution of the same mass .",
    "the @xmath37 dependence can however be moderately modified as the clusters see a mass increasing moderately with @xmath28 .    to estimate the galactic population of dscs",
    ", we take the average star cluster formation rate ( hereafter cfr ) over the entire galactic disk ( @xmath38 kpc ) to be @xmath39 @xcite following a schechter initial cluster mass function @xcite over the mass range @xmath40 @xcite which is assumed to remain invariant over the last few hundred myr .",
    "this implies @xmath41 clusters form per myr which have properties ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 kpc ) that must have them evolve to dscs if a sufficiently high fraction of bhs are retained . assuming a steady state conversion to the dsc phase with lifetime @xmath35 myr ( see above ) , the expected number of @xmath19 dscs in the galaxy within @xmath43 kpc is @xmath44 .",
    "for dscs with @xmath45 , the corresponding number is @xmath46 .",
    "hence , a significant number of dscs can be expected in the inner galactic zone",
    ".      there has been recent concern with the widely debated irs 13e ( hereafter irs13e ) ; an extremely compact stellar association of a few young , massive stars at a close projection to the galactic center that apparently survives the extreme tidal field by being bound by an invisible mass @xcite . while a @xmath47 intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) was widely believed to be this invisible mass @xcite , this possibility has recently been ruled out with a significant confidence by @xcite through their newer proper motion measurements , leaving the nature of the invisible component of irs13e currently ambiguous .",
    "this status of irs13e prompts us to consider whether its dark component can be an ensemble of stellar - mass bhs instead . to that end",
    ", we perform preliminary n - body calculations to determine whether a dsc configuration resembling irs13e can be a possible fate of a star cluster very close to the galactic center .",
    "these computed clusters follow circular orbits around the galactic smbh ( a central mass of @xmath48 which is a combination of the mass of the smbh and that of the nuclear star cluster within @xmath49 pc ) within @xmath50 few pc , where star formation has been shown to possibly lead to a top - heavy stellar imf @xcite .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the final state , we begin the n - body calculations from an evolved phase of the cluster , for computational ease .",
    "therefore , we initiate the computations with plummer clusters made of stars which are pre - evolved until @xmath51 myr age . this age is slightly earlier than when the most massive star ( of @xmath52 ) evolves to a bh .",
    "all the stars are thus still on their main sequence .",
    "observations indicate a very flat imf ( @xmath53 ; see @xcite ) for stars close to the galactic center and also a dearth of low - mass stars .",
    "the latter is evident from a declining density of b - stars away from the central smbh @xcite and a significant lack of coronal x - ray emission @xcite from the sgra@xmath54 field .",
    "it is currently unclear from the literature what would be the lower - mass limit of such an imf , which , in turn , determines the @xmath55 of the mass function ( mf ) and its lower limit @xmath56 at cluster - age @xmath57 . in this preliminary study",
    ", we simply take the total number of stars in the cluster @xmath58 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 at age @xmath57 as free parameters .",
    "the upper mf limit is chosen to be the canonical @xmath59 and the stellar metallicity is solar .",
    "these limits are the zams values and they are appropriately reduced during the @xmath51 myr pre - evolution by the nbody6 s built - in stellar evolution prescription ( see above ) . like the computations in sec .",
    "[ darkcl ] , we retain all the bhs ( of @xmath60 as obtained from within nbody6 ) in the cluster . at the beginning of the computations ,",
    "the models are taken compact to a similar extent as irs13e @xcite , with half - mass radii between @xmath61 and they orbit within @xmath62 .",
    "we find that to reach a irs13e - like state , _",
    "i.e. _ , a state where typically @xmath32 luminous , young stars are very tightly bound to a cluster of @xmath63 bhs , it takes @xmath64 and a rather extreme lower cutoff of @xmath65 for mf index @xmath66 ( at age @xmath57 ) , this @xmath55 being close to the upper limit of the @xcite index . a steeper mf requires even higher @xmath56 . as a demonstration , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : irs13 ] ( top panel ) that this cluster eventually evolves to a configuration consisting of @xmath67 bhs , comprising a @xmath47 dark component , orbited by @xmath68 young stars .",
    "although the half - mass radius of the system expands at the beginning of the evolution , primarily driven by the mass loss through the massive stars winds and their supernovae , it finally collapses to @xmath69 pc , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : irs13 ] ( middle panel ) , by the time the system arrives at the above configuration .",
    "the luminous members in this state include 1 - 2 o - stars ( those still on the main sequence ) and a few helium and wolf - rayet stars , thereby being of similar variety as observed in irs13e .",
    "the final state of the system , therefore , resembles irs13e in terms of compactness and stellar content @xcite .",
    "[ fig : irs13 ] ( lower panel ) shows that the luminous sub - system becomes highly super - virial , _",
    "i.e. _ , a dsc , as the irs13e - like state occurs .",
    "the calculations presented in this section are preliminary which suggest an intermediate state of a cluster , close to the galactic center , that would evolve to an irs13e - like configuration .",
    "it remains an open question whether any reasonable initial cluster evolves to such an intermediate phase , which depends on the low - mass limit of the galactic - central imf , its index and the initial mass and compactness of the cluster , at a given @xmath28 .",
    "a scan over these parameters , beginning with much larger and more compact clusters , is necessary to determine such possible initial configuration(s ) , which is much more compute - intensive .",
    "although the above @xmath56 appears too high for a lower cut - off , its progenitor cluster would have a smaller limit taking into account the rapid tidal stripping over the 3.5 myr pre - evolution .",
    "tidal stripping also implies a steeper initial index , in better agreement with the observed one .",
    "although we over - simplify by effectively ignoring the dynamical evolution of the cluster during the stellar pre - evolution , the dynamical history is not instrumental in determining the occurrence of a irs13e - type state which happens merely due to the competition between stellar evolution and tidal dissolution of the cluster .",
    "it is enough that the cluster remains bound by the time most of the stars become bhs quenching the wind mass loss ; the system would then core - collapse to a compact configuration irrespective of its history .",
    "this is in contrast with the `` classical '' dscs discussed in sec .",
    "[ darkcl ] whose formation depends crucially on mass segregation .    a potential drawback of this `` in - situ '' model is that it is likely to significantly over - produce the number of massive stars seen in the galactic center .    given these drawbacks , the calculations in this section are only to suggest that irs13e might be a dsc but are by no means conclusive .",
    "our calculations ( sec .  [ darkcl ] ) signify that a gravitationally bound star cluster naturally evolves to an apparent super - virial state , while remaining bound as a whole , as a consequence of the interplay between the dynamics and the evolution of stars , provided a significant number of stellar remnants survive in the bound system after their formation via supernovae .",
    "the existence of such dark star clusters is a first - time prediction and serves as an excellent cross - check of the retention of supernova remnants in star clusters , the effects of which is widely explored .",
    "the very presence of dscs would kill two birds with one stone by having consequences on the widely debated theoretical stellar collapse models @xcite due to the implied direct constraints on natal kicks , and by securing star clusters as potential sources for the forthcoming `` advanced ligo '' @xcite gw detector @xcite .",
    "given that the dscs must have a significant population in the inner region of our galaxy , it is tempting to conduct a survey of intermediate - aged ( see below ) stellar assemblies to identify them .",
    "dark star clusters can be observationally distinguished from actually dissolving clusters ( which are also super virial and hence expanding and are generally young ) through their compact sizes in spite of their intermediate ages , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lagrev ] . that the apparent super - virial state of a dsc is not due to an imbh , would be indicated by the absence of a central cusp in its velocity - dispersion profile , which would be there otherwise @xcite",
    "the present studies justify dscs as predicted , new type of compact stellar populations .",
    "an immediate improvement over this study is to explore any effects of varying orbital eccentricity and different initial profile types ( _ e.g. _ , using king instead of plummer profiles ) .",
    "also , the effect of a varying star ( and hence cluster ) formation rate over the galactic disc needs to be incorporated to determine the predicted galactic dsc population , as an improvement over our assumption of a uniform average cluster formation .",
    "another development would be to consider a disk - like mass distribution instead of a central point - mass ( but see sec .",
    "[ dcpop ] ) .",
    "the preliminary computations in sec .  [ irs13e ] suggest that the dark component of irs13e can be an ensemble of stellar mass bhs and irs13e may therefore perhaps be a dsc .",
    "however , this conclusion should , for now , be taken as being suggestive rather than conclusive due to the drawbacks discussed ( sec .",
    "[ irs13e ] ) .",
    "we postpone a more detailed and self - consistent study on this issue in a future paper .                                                                            ,",
