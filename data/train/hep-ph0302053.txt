    "ever since the renewed burst of interest in the spin structure of the nucleon , triggered fifteen years ago by the measurement of the proton spin dependent deep inelastic scattering structure function @xmath0 by the emc experiment @xcite , polarized deep inelastic scattering has evolved into a very prolific field for combined theoretical and experimental efforts @xcite . as result of this activity ,",
    "an increasingly precise qcd improved partonic description of polarized nucleons has emerged , phrased in terms of more refined and exhaustive extractions of polarized parton distributions .",
    "indeed , the number of qcd analyses of polarized inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data at next to leading order ( nlo ) accuracy has rapidly grown in the few last years @xcite . in some cases",
    "these studies also take into account polarized semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) data @xcite . the usual outcome from these analyses",
    "are different sets of parton distributions which reproduce fairly well most data sets within the quoted errors , with overall @xmath1 values pretty close to the number @xmath2 of degrees of freedom ( d.o.f ) as required by the familiar ` hypothesis - testing criterion ' .",
    "although the apparent fulfillment of this requirement , the resulting parton distributions not only suffer from large uncertainties , but in some cases small subsets of inclusive data are badly fitted .",
    "this facts point to the need of a more stringent criterion for assessing the goodness of a particular fit , and also the compatibility between data sets .    in the case of polarized semi",
    "- inclusive data , the motivation for a more careful analysis is twofold . for one side",
    ", inclusive data do not provide enough information for a complete separation of the quark and antiquark distributions of different flavors , so the analyses must rely either on sidis data or on some external assumption .    from another side ,",
    "the standard procedure used to analyze semi - inclusive data , in terms of polarized parton densities and unpolarized fragmentation functions , has been criticized questioning , in first place , the accuracy of the present generation of fragmentation functions @xcite , suggesting that the usual assumptions about spin independence of fragmentation process may not hold @xcite , and also addressing the issue of target fragmentation contributions @xcite .",
    "regarding the first issue , recently there has been an increasing amount activity around the issue of the polarization of sea quarks in the proton @xcite .",
    "this interest has been driven in part by the confirmation of the isospin symmetry breaking at sea quark level in unpolarized dis @xcite , by the level of refinement attained in qcd global analysis of spin dependent data @xcite , and by the expected precision of forthcoming polarized semi - inclusive measurements , polarized drell yan dilepton production , and prompt photon production @xcite .",
    "moreover , in spite of the encouraging achievements in polarized semi - inclusive measurements in the few last years @xcite , which have shown to be in good agreement with inclusive data @xcite , the available data fail to constrain unambiguously the polarization of sea quarks in the proton when included in global qcd fits performed following just the hypothesis testing criterion @xcite .    in face of this situation , it is worthwhile assessing the goodness of global fits to polarized data , involving both inclusive semi - inclusive measurements , with more stringent criteria , in the line of what has been proposed in reference @xcite , and applied to lo unpolarized sets of data in @xcite .",
    "the main point of this approach is to apply the parameter fitting criterion to subsets of data in the global fit , assessing in this way features as the degree of compatibility between subsets of data , the impact of specific data in certain parameters of the fit , and the overall consistency of the global fit .",
    "the occurrence of such an inconsistency may hint , besides an unexpected error source in the experiment , the non validity of assumptions or other inputs of the theoretical calculation .    in the following , after defining our conventions and sketching the computation of the relevant observables , we present a global fit of polarized inclusive and semi - inclusive data exploring the dependence of the overall @xmath3 of the fit on the respective @xmath4 for each particular experiment by means of the lagrange multiplier method @xcite .",
    "the analysis is performed in two stages . in the first one we restrict the analysis to inclusive data , and to those parton densities which can be extracted there . in the second stage",
    "we add semi - inclusive observables and discriminate between valence and sea quark densities of different flavors , but at variance with reference @xcite , where semi - inclusive data was only allowed to fix the sea quark polarization , here we leave all the distributions free .    in order to circumvent the extremely time - consuming convolutions integrals characteristic of the semi - inclusive observables at nlo",
    ", we apply the double mellin transform approach , developed recently in @xcite .",
    "this new approach has produced results in complete agreement with those obtained with the convolution method , but obtained considerably faster .",
    "as result of our analysis , we find that the parameter fitting criterion shows a reasonably good level of internal consistency between the inclusive measurements .",
    "the addition of sidis data sets leads to global fits with @xmath5 values fairly close to unity , however the increase of the statistical weight of this data in the fits shows rather different consequences when either positively ( @xmath6 ) or negatively ( @xmath7 ) charged final state hadron data is considered .",
    "for @xmath7 data , the increase in weight does not modify significantly those parton distributions coming from inclusive sets , suggesting consistency between the different data sets and also between data and the theoretical framework . however , the analysis of @xmath6 data shows a sizable degree of conflict with the rest of the fit .",
    "throughout the present analysis , we follow the same conventions and definitions for the polarized inclusive asymmetries and parton densities as in reference @xcite . in the totally inclusive case ,",
    "the spin dependent asymmetries are given by @xcite    @xmath8 } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the inclusive spin - dependent nucleon structure function @xmath9 can be written at nlo as a convolution between polarized parton densities for quarks and gluons , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and coefficient functions @xmath12@xcite @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a more detailed discussion about these coefficient functions and their factorization scheme dependence can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is the unpolarized nucleon structure function that can be written in terms of @xmath15 and r , the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross section @xcite .",
    "analogously , for the semi - inclusive asymmetries we have : @xmath16 bf where the superscript @xmath17 denotes the hadron detected in the final state , and the variable @xmath18 is given by the ratio between the hadron energy and that of the spectators in the target .",
    "the region @xmath19 , over which @xmath18 is integrated , is determined by kinematical cuts applied when measuring the asymmetries .    for the spin dependent structure function @xmath20 , we use the nlo expression @xcite @xmath21 , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and in order to avoid the convolution integrals in @xmath22 and @xmath23 we switch to moment space in both variables as suggested in @xcite . in moment",
    "space , the convolution integrals reduce products of the mellin moments of the parton densities @xmath24 fragmentation functions @xmath25 and the double mellin transform of the coefficient functions @xmath26 , defined by @xmath27 these coefficients can be written as @xcite    @xmath28   \\left\\ {   s_1(m ) + s_1(n ) -\\frac{1}{m(m+1)}-\\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\    & &   + 3 s_2(m ) - s_2(n ) \\bigg ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath29\\nonumber \\\\   & & - \\frac{2}{(m+1)n ( n+1 ) } \\bigg ]   \\\\ % \\delta c_{qg}^{(1),nm } ( q^2)&= & % \\!&=&\\ ! %   t_r \\frac{n-1}{n(n+1 ) } \\bigg[\\frac{1}{m-1}-\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{n}-s_1(m ) - s_1(n )   \\bigg ] \\ ; , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have set the factorization and renormalization scales to @xmath30 . as usual ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33    for @xmath34 and @xmath35 quarks _ plus _ antiquarks densities at the initial scale @xmath36 gev@xmath37 we propose @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the standard beta function , while for strange quarks _ plus _ antiquarks we use @xmath40 with a similar parametric form for gluons @xmath41    the first moments of the quark densities @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) are often related to the hyperon beta decay constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 through the su(3 ) symmetry relations @xmath46 @xmath47 under such an assumption , the previous equations would strongly constrain the normalization of the quark densities . however , as we are not interested in forcing flavor symmetry , we leave aside that strong assumption and relax the symmetry relations introducing two parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "these parameters account quantitatively for eventual departures from flavor symmetry considerations , including also some uncertainties on the low-@xmath50 behavior , and higher order corrections , @xmath51 @xmath52 and we take them as a measure of the degree of fulfillment of the bjorken sum rule @xcite and the @xmath53 symmetry",
    ".    equations ( [ bj ] ) and ( [ su(3 ) ] ) allow to write the normalization of the three quark flavors in terms of @xmath54 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "notice that no constraints have been imposed on the breaking parameters since we expect them to be fixed by data .",
    "the remaining parameters are constrained in such a way that positivity with respect to grv98 parton distributions is fulfilled .",
    "these last parameterizations are used in order to compute the denominators of equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant at large @xmath50 , and since no polarized data is available in that kinematical region , we directly fix the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the nlo sets in agreement with grv98 . consistently with the choice for the unpolarized parton distributions , we use the values of @xmath58 given in ref.@xcite to compute @xmath59 at nlo .    as antiquark densities",
    "we take @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 quarks , and we assume @xmath63 since the possibility of discrimination in the @xmath64 sector is beyond the precision of the data ( as in the unpolarized case ) .",
    "fragmentation functions are taken from @xcite and we also use the flavor separation criterion proposed there , which have shown to be in agreement with most recent analysis @xcite .",

    "is confirmed when a detailed analysis using a variant of the parameter fitting criterion is performed . for sidis data",
    "the level of consistency is considerably weaker , particularly in the case of positively charged final state hadron data . even though this kind of analysis can not establish whereas either data or some particular ingredient in the theoretical approach is responsible for the discrepancy , the unexpected features found in the analysis of @xmath6 data , for different targets and coming from different experiments , hint an inaccuracy in the separation between positively and negatively charged hadron fragmentation functions .",
