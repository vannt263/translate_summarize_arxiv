    "<S> the magnetic field in the domain is assumed homogeneous and inclined . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the conversion to alfvn waves near the layer of equal acoustic and alfven speeds is measured calculating their energy flux . </S>",
    "<S> the particular amplitude and phase relations between the oscillations of magnetic field and velocity help us to demonstrate that the waves produced after the transformation and reaching upper atmosphere are indeed alfvn waves . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the conversion from fast magneto - acoustic waves to alfvn waves is particularly important for the inclination @xmath0 and azimuth @xmath1 angles of the magnetic field between 55 and 65 degrees , with the maximum shifted to larger inclinations for lower frequency waves . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum alfvn flux transmitted to the upper atmosphere is about 23 times lower than the corresponding acoustic flux .    </S>",
    "<S> conversion from fast - mode high-@xmath2 magneto - acoustic waves ( analog of @xmath3 modes ) to slow - mode waves in solar active regions is relatively well studied both from analytical theories and numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , see @xcite for a review . in a two - dimensional situation , </S>",
    "<S> the transformation from fast to slow magnetoacoustic modes is demonstrated to be particularly strong for a narrow range of the magnetic field inclinations around 2030 degrees to the vertical . </S>",
    "<S> however , no generalized picture exists so far for conversion from magneto - acoustic to alfvn waves in a three - dimensional situation . </S>",
    "<S> studies of this conversion were initiated by cally & goossens @xcite , who found that the conversion is most efficient for preferred magnetic field inclinations between 30 and 40 degrees , and azimuth angles between 60 and 80 degrees , and that alfvnic fluxes transmitted to the upper atmosphere can exceed acoustic fluxes in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> newington & cally @xcite studied the conversion properties of low - frequency gravity waves , showing that large magnetic field inclinations can help transmitting an important amount of the alfvnic energy flux to the upper atmosphere .     </S>",
    "<S> time - height variations of the three projected velocity components corresponding to @xmath4 ( alfven wave , left ) , @xmath5 ( fast wave , middle ) and @xmath6 ( slow wave , right ) for @xmath7 mhz in a simulation with @xmath8 inclined by @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",

    "<S> the purpose of our study is to calculate the efficiency of the conversion from fast - mode high-@xmath2 magneto - acoustic waves to alfvn and slow waves in the upper atmosphere for various frequencies and wavenumbers as a function of the field orientation . </S>",
    "<S> we limit our study to a plane parallel atmosphere permeated by a constant inclined magnetic field , to perform a meaningful comparison with the work of cally & goossens @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . numerical simulation will allow generalization to more realistic models in our future work .    </S>",
    "<S> we numerically solve the non - linear equations of ideal mhd assuming all vectors in three spatial directions and all derivatives in two directions ( i.e. 2.5d approximation , see @xcite ) , though perturbations are kept small to approximate the linear regime . </S>",
    "<S> an acoustic wave of a given frequency and wave number is generated at @xmath15 mm below the solar surface in a standard model atmosphere permeated by a uniform inclined magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the top boundary of the simulation box is 1 mm above the surface , and 0.8 mm above the layer where the acoustic speed , @xmath16 , and the alfvn speed , @xmath17 , are equal . </S>",
    "<S> we consider frequencies @xmath18 and 5 mhz and wave numbers @xmath19 mm@xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation grid covers field inclinations @xmath0 from 0@xmath22 to 80@xmath22 and field azimuths @xmath1 from 0@xmath22 to 160@xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the field strength is kept at @xmath23 g. to separate the alfvn mode from the fast and slow magneto - acoustic modes in the magnetically dominated atmosphere we use velocity projections onto three characteristic directions : @xmath24 ;    \\nonumber\\\\ { \\hat\\mathbf{e}}_{\\rm perp } & = & [   -   \\cos\\phi \\sin^2\\theta \\sin\\phi , \\ , 1-\\sin^2\\theta \\sin^2\\phi ,   \\ , -   \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi ] ; \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> the larger inclination of the ridges mean lower propagation speeds and vice versa . note , that by projecting the velocities , we are able to separate the modes only in the magnetically dominated atmosphere , i.e. above the solid line in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : modes ] . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows how the incident fast mode wave propagates to the equipartition layer and then splits into several components . </S>",
    "<S> the alfvn wave is produced by mode conversion above 0.2 mm ( left panel ) and propagates upwards with the ( rapid ) alfvn speed , confirmed by almost vertical inclination of the ridges . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the essentially magnetic fast - mode low-@xmath2 wave produced in the upper atmosphere ( middle panel ) is reflected , and its velocity variations in the upper layers vanish with height . the ( acoustic ) slow - mode low-@xmath2 wave escapes to the upper atmosphere tunnelling over the cut - off layer due to the field inclination of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the velocity variations of the alfvn wave are comparable to those of the slow wave .     </S>",

    "<S> red lines : alfvn mode ; black lines : fast mode.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to confirm the alfvn nature of the transformed waves , as revealed by the projection calculations , we checked the amplitude and phase relations for all three modes reaching the upper atmosphere . for the alfvn mode the magnetic field @xmath27 and velocity variations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 should be in equipartition ( i.e. @xmath31 ) , and both magnitudes should oscillate in phase ( see priest @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : phases ] presents the calculations of the amplitude ratio @xmath32 and temporal phase shift between @xmath27 and @xmath30 , where both velocity and magnetic field variations are projected in the corresponding characteristic direction for each mode ( eq .  [ eq : directions ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation confirms that , indeed , for all magnetic field orientations @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the amplitude ratio for the alfvn mode ( @xmath29 projection ) is around one ( left panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly not the case for the slow and fast modes . for the fast mode , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude ratio is two orders of magnitude larger , and for the slow mode , it is two orders of magnitude lower than one . for the alfvn mode the phase shifts group around zero for all @xmath1 , unlike the case of the fast mode ( right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> we did not calculate the phase shifts for the slow mode as the variations of the magnetic field are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the properties of the simulated alfvn mode separated by the projection correspond to those expected for a classical alfvn mode .     examples of the height dependence of the magnetic ( solid line ) and acoustic ( dashed line ) vertical fluxes , defined by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    an example of the height variations of the acoustic and magnetic fluxes is given in figure [ fig : fluxes2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the total vertical flux ( dotted line ) is conserved in the simulations except for the limitations caused by the finite grid resolution not resolving slow small - wavelength waves in the deep layers ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : modes ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> both acoustic and magnetic fluxes show strongest variations near the conversion layer and become constant above it between 0.5 and 1 mm height . </S>",
    "<S> the fluxes reaching the upper atmosphere depend crucially on the orientation of the field . in this example </S>",
    "<S> , the acoustic flux decreases with @xmath0 whilst the magnetic flux increases with @xmath0 and becomes larger than the acoustic fluxes for @xmath33 . as the fast wave </S>",
    "<S> is already reflected in the upper atmosphere ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : modes ] ) , the magnetic flux at these heights is due to the propagating alfvn wave .     </S>",

    "<S> upper panels give magnetic fluxes and lower panels give acoustic fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    finally , figure  [ fig : fluxes ] gives the time averages of the vertical magnetic and acoustic fluxes at the top of the atmosphere as a function of the field orientation . </S>",
    "<S> as proven above , the magnetic flux at 1 mm corresponds to the alfvn mode . at @xmath7 mhz </S>",
    "<S> , the maximum of the magnetic flux corresponds to @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum is shifted to larger inclinations @xmath36 for waves with @xmath18 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the sharp maximum of the alfvnic flux transmission agrees well with the conclusions made previously by cally & goossens @xcite , though the exact position of the maximum is shifted to somewhat larger inclinations . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of the transmitted acoustic flux corresponds to inclinations @xmath37 for @xmath7 mhz waves , and to @xmath38 for @xmath18 mhz waves , again , in agreement with previous calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of the fluxes is about 30 times lower for 3 mhz compared to 5 mhz . at some angles the afvn magnetic flux transmitted to the upper atmosphere is larger than the acoustic flux . </S>",
    "<S> however , at angles corresponding to the maximum of the transmission , the alfvn flux is 2 - 3 times lower than the corresponding acoustic flux .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that quantitatively simulating mode transformation numerically is a challenge , as any numerical inaccuracies are amplified in such second - order quantities as wave energy fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the tests presented in this paper prove the robustness of our numerical procedure and offer an effective way to separate the alfvn from magneto - acoustic modes in numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us in future to study the coupling between magneto - acoustic and alfvn waves in more realistic situations resembling complex solar magnetic structures . </S>"
