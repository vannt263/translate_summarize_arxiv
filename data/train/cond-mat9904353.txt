    "since the recent experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases @xcite , much interest has been raised about the coherence properties of the condensates .",
    "considerable attention has been devoted to the matter of the relative phase between two condensates : how this phase manifests itself in an interference experiment @xcite , how it can be established by measurement @xcite , and how it evolves in presence of atomic interactions @xcite and in presence of particle losses @xcite .",
    "as it was proved in recent experiments performed at jila , binary mixtures of condensates represent an ideal system to study the phase coherence properties of bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in these experiments two condensates in two different internal atomic states are created with a well defined relative phase . after a time @xmath0",
    "during which the condensates evolve in the trapping potentials , one mixes coherently the two internal atomic states which makes the two condensates interfere ; from the spatial interference pattern one gets the relative phase of the two condensates . by repeating the whole experimental process",
    ", one has access to the distribution of the relative phase after an evolution time @xmath0 , so that one can investigate phase decoherence as function of time .",
    "the interaction between the two condensates in the jila experiment gives rise to a rich spatial separation dynamics between the two condensates @xcite , which complicates the theoretical study of the relative phase dynamics .",
    "as a consequence previous theoretical treatments of the phase decoherence processes , dealing essentially with steady state condensates , as in @xcite , can not _ a priori _ be applied to the experimental situation .    a treatment of the phase coherence of two interacting , non stationary , condensates can be found in @xcite , with two important differences as compared to the present situation of interest : ( 1 ) in @xcite the condensates are subject to a continuous coherent coupling of amplitude @xmath1 ; results are obtained from a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath2 and can not be simply extended to the present @xmath3 case .",
    "( 2 ) in @xcite all the coupling constants @xmath4 between the two internal atomic states @xmath5 and @xmath6 are assumed to be equal .    in this paper we propose a formalism to study the relative phase dynamics of interacting and dynamically evolving bose - einstein condensates initially at zero temperature .",
    "we present the general method in section [ sec : gen - method ] .",
    "it consists in expanding the initial state on fock states , and in evolving each fock state in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we determine the time dependence of the phase collapse for a binary mixture of condensates , due to ( 1 ) fluctuations in the relative number of particles between the condensates , intrinsic to the initial state with well defined relative phase , and ( 2 ) fluctuations in the total number of particles .",
    "in the next two sections we apply this general formalism to two limiting cases that can be treated analytically .    the first case , in section [ sec : breath - together ] , considers a particular solution of the non - linear schrdinger equations for the condensates wavefunctions ; in this solution the two condensates remain spatially superimposed as they breathe in phase , provided that dynamical stability conditions ( that we determine ) are satisfied .",
    "we find that phase decoherence can be highly reduced with respect to non mutually interacting condensates when the three coupling constants @xmath7 between atoms in the two internal states @xmath8 are close to each other .    in section [ sec : closeg s ]",
    ", we therefore study in a more general case ( not restricted to the breathe - together solution ) the dynamics of the relative phase for a mixture of condensates for close coupling constants .",
    "our treatment requires also in this case the absence of demixing instability , a point that we discuss in detail .",
    "finally we discuss the case of the jila experiment in section [ sec : jila ] .",
    "this case , that corresponds to close coupling constants in a regime of demixing instability , is more difficult to analyze .",
    "the predicted phase collapse time depends on the fluctuations of the total number of particles ; it is on the order of 0.4 second for gaussian fluctuations of 8% .",
    "in this section , we introduce a gedanken experiment to characterize phase coherence between two condensates : the relevant quantity is the interference term @xmath9 between the atomic fields of the two condensates @xmath5 and @xmath6 . subsequently we express this interference term in the hartree - fock approximation , assuming an initially well defined relative phase between the condensates . after a further approximation on the modulus and the phase of the condensate wavefunctions , we determine the decay with time of the interference term due to atomic interactions ; we arrive at the simple results eq.([eq : inter_court ] ) for a fixed total number of particles and eq.([eq : gaus_court ] ) for gaussian fluctuations in the total number of particles .",
    "the experimental procedure we consider to measure the phase coherence is inspired by recent experiments at jila @xcite .",
    "a condensate is first created in a trap in some internal atomic state @xmath5 ; the corresponding condensate wavefunction in the zero temperature mean - field approximation is @xmath10 , a stationary solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation : @xmath11\\phi_0 .",

    "note that we have normalized @xmath10 to unity .    at time",
    "@xmath18 a resonant electromagnetic pulse transfers in a coherent way part of the atoms to a second internal state @xmath6 . the state of the system is then given in the hartree - fock approximation by @xmath19^n \\label{eq : init}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 .",
    "as we assume a rabi coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath6 much more intense than @xmath21 the atomic interactions have a negligible effect during the transfer so that the amplitudes @xmath22 depend only on the pulse parameters , not on the number @xmath12 of particles . in the @xmath12-particle state eq.([eq : init ] ) the condensate in state @xmath5 and the condensate in state @xmath6 have a well defined relative phase ; we therefore call this state a _ phase state _ , in analogy with @xcite .",
    "the two condensates evolve freely in their trapping potentials during the time @xmath0 . during this evolution",
    "we assume that there is no coherent coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath6 to lock the relative phase of the condensates ; in particular the only considered interactions between the particles are elastic , of the type @xmath23 ( coupling constant @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 ( coupling constant @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 ( coupling constant @xmath28 ) . we therefore expect a collapse of the relative phase for sufficiently long times , due to atomic interactions .    to test the phase coherence at time @xmath0 , a second electromagnetic pulse is applied to mix the internal states @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that this second pulse is a @xmath29 pulse , so that the atomic field operators in the heisenberg picture are transformed according to @xmath30 @xmath31 being an adjustable phase .",
    "one then measures the mean spatial density @xmath32 in the internal state @xmath5 , averaging over many realizations of the whole experiment : @xmath33    the signature of a phase coherence between the two condensates at time @xmath0 is the dependence of the mean density @xmath32 on the adjustable phase @xmath31 .",
    "more precisely we define the contrast @xmath34 the contrast involves the interference term @xmath35 which carries the information about the relative phase between the two condensates .",
    "the time evolution in the phase state representation is not simple , as an initial phase state is mapped onto a superposition of phase states .",
    "it is more convenient to introduce fock states , that is states with a well defined number of particles in @xmath5 and in @xmath6 , these numbers being preserved by the time evolution .",
    "we therefore expand the initial phase state over the fock states : @xmath36 where we set @xmath37 .    by calculating the evolution of each fock state in the simplest hartree - fock approximation",
    ", we get the following mapping : @xmath38 where the condensates wavefunctions evolve according to the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations : @xmath39 \\phi_\\varepsilon \\label{eq : gpe}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath40 ) with the initial conditions @xmath41 and where the time dependent phase factor @xmath42 solves : @xmath43 equation ( [ eq : apoint ] ) is derived in appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "physically @xmath44 is simply the opposite of the mean interaction energy between the particles in the fock state . in the case where the fock state is a steady state ,",
    "the need for the phase factor @xmath42 additional to the gross - pitaevskii equation is obvious ; the exact phase factor is indeed @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the energy of the fock state , whereas the phase factor obtained from the gross - pitaevskii evolution is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the chemical potential in @xmath8 .    using the evolution of the fock states , and other approximations valid in the limit of large numbers of particles ( as detailed in the appendix [ app : interf ] )",
    "we obtain for the interference term between the condensates with a well - defined total number @xmath12 of particles : @xmath49 where @xmath37 .",
    "the exact computation of this sum remains a formidable task , since it involves in principle the solution of @xmath12 different sets of two coupled gross - pitaevskii equations .",
    "we introduce some simplifying approximations in the next subsection .      in the present experiments",
    "the total number of particles fluctuates from one realization to the other , so that eq.([eq : complique ] ) has to be averaged over @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the fluctuations of the total number of particles have a standard deviation @xmath50 much smaller than the mean total particle number @xmath51 . as the distributions of the number of particles in @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a phase state have also a width much smaller than @xmath51 ( typically on the order of @xmath52 ) we can assume than the number of particles in @xmath5 and in @xmath6 are very close to their average values @xmath53 .",
    "we now take advantage of this property to simplify eq.([eq : complique ] ) .",
