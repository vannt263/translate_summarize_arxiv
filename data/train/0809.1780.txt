    "a detailed analysis of @xmath2 and @xmath3 based on the itep sum rules @xcite has been performed several years ago @xcite . during the past years",
    "new and more precise data for @xmath4 have become available in the low energy region , in particular for the parameters of the charmonium and bottomonium resonances .",
    "furthermore , the error in the strong coupling constant @xmath5 which enters this analysis has been reduced .",
    "last not least , the vacuum polarization induced by massive quarks has been computed in four - loop approximation ; more precisely : its first derivative at @xmath6 , which corresponds to the lowest moment of the familiar @xmath7-ratio has been evaluated in @xcite . based on these developments a new determination of the quark masses has been performed in ref .",
    "more recently also the second moment has been calculated @xcite .",
    "the extraction of @xmath8 from low moments of the cross section @xmath9 exploits its sharp rise close to the threshold for open charm and bottom production . by evaluating the moments @xmath10 with low values of @xmath11 ,",
    "the long distance contributions are averaged out and @xmath12 involves short distance physics only , with a characteristic scale of order @xmath13 . through dispersion relations the moments",
    "are directly related to derivatives of the vacuum polarization function at @xmath6 , @xmath14 which can be evaluated in perturbative qcd ( @xmath15 is the @xmath16 mass at the scale @xmath17 ) .",
    "the perturbative series for the coefficients @xmath18 in order @xmath19 was originally evaluated up to @xmath20 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and to `` arbitrary '' high order in @xcite .",
    "the four - loop contributions to @xmath21 and @xmath22 were evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite , those to @xmath23 in @xcite .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq::mexp ] ) and ( [ eq::mexp1 ] ) the quark mass can be extracted . at this point",
    "it should be emphasized that the relative weight of resonances and continuum is quite different in the experimental moments .",
    "furthermore , low moments are less sensitive to non - perturbative contributions from condensates , to the coulombic higher order effects , the variation of @xmath17 and the parametric @xmath24 dependence . for @xmath25 :",
    "@xmath26 the moment with @xmath27 is less sensitive to data for @xmath28 from the continuum region above @xmath29 , where experimental results are scarce and the aforementioned theory uncertainties are still relatively small .",
    "the agreement between @xmath25 and @xmath27 ( @xmath30 ) , together with the nice convergence with increasing order in @xmath24 can be considered as additional confirmation of this approach .",
    "instead of measuring the moments @xmath31 in @xmath32 annihilation they can also be determined in lattice simulations .",
    "this approach has recently been pioneered in @xcite using the highly improved staggered quarks ( hisq ) discretization of the quark action in combination with four - loop perturbative results @xcite .",
    "the final result , @xmath33 corresponds to a scale - invariant mass @xmath34 and is in excellent agreement with the determinations based on @xmath32 data .     and",
    "@xmath35.[fig::mb_compare],title=\"fig : \" ] and @xmath35.[fig::mb_compare],title=\"fig : \" ]    the approach based on @xmath32 data is also applicable to the determination of @xmath3 .",
    "the three results based on @xmath36 and 3 are of comparable precision .",
    "the relative size of the contributions from the threshold and the continuum region decreases for the moments @xmath27 and 3 . on the other hand , the theory uncertainty is still small .",
    "therefore the result from @xmath27 was taken as the final answer @xcite , despite the fact that @xmath23 was not yet known .",
    "the result , @xmath37 , corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "the recent evaluation @xcite of @xmath23 has lead to a decrease of the central value by @xmath39 and a reduction of the error from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "a comparison of a few selected @xmath3- and @xmath2-determinations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::mb_compare ] .",
    "one of the most precise and theoretically safe determination of @xmath24 is based on measurements of the cross section for electron - positron annihilation into hadrons @xcite .",
    "these have been performed in the low - energy region between 2  gev and 10  gev and , in particular , at and around the @xmath1 resonance at 91.2  gev .",
    "conceptually closely related is the measurement of the semileptonic decay rate of the @xmath0-lepton , leading to a determination of @xmath24 at a scale below 2 gev @xcite .",
    "the perturbative expansion for the ratio @xmath42 in numerical form is given by @xmath43 here @xmath44 and the normalization scale @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 corrections are conveniently classified according to their power of @xmath47 , with @xmath47 denoting the number of light quarks .",
    "the @xmath48 term is part of the `` renormalon chain '' , the next term of order @xmath49 was evaluated in @xcite , the complete five - loop calculation has been performed in @xcite .",
    "let us now move to the analysis of present data for @xmath32 annihilation and @xmath0 decays .",
    "measurements of @xmath28 at lower energies , with their correspondingly larger values of @xmath24 , are in principle more sensitive to @xmath5 if the same relative precision could be obtained . at present , however , the systematic experimental error of 2% is a limiting element for a competitive measurement .",
    "the final result of a recent analysis @xcite @xmath50 represents the combined information on the strong coupling from @xmath7 measurements in the region between @xmath51 and the bottom threshold .",
    "in contrast to the situation below 10 gev the extraction of @xmath24 from @xmath1-decays is affected by the @xmath52 terms .",
    "the @xmath53 analysis of the electroweak working group @xcite is shifted @xcite by @xmath54 and one finds @xmath55 the theory error can now safely be neglected .",
    "higher orders are of particular relevance in the low - energy region , for example in @xmath0 decays .",
    "the correction from perturbative qcd to the ratio @xmath56 is given by the factor @xmath57 which can be evaluated in fixed order perturbation theory or with `` contour improvement '' as proposed in @xcite : @xmath58 starting from @xmath59 @xcite one obtains @xcite @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the second uncertainty corresponds to a change in the renormalization scale @xmath62 between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "as stated above the theory error for @xmath24 from @xmath1 decays is small compared to the experimental uncertainties . for @xmath0 decays the difference between fort and cipt must be considered as irreducible uncertainty @xcite : @xmath65 applying four - loop running and matching @xcite ( with negligible error from the evolution from @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) : @xmath68    the shifts in @xmath5 from z- and @xmath0-decays , are opposite in sign and move the values in the _ proper _ direction , decreasing , thus , the current slight mismatch between two independent determinations of @xmath24 .",
    "the two results are in remarkable agreement and can be combined to one of the most precise and presently only @xmath69 result : @xmath70    as discussed above , @xmath24 from @xmath0-decays is strongly affected by theory uncertainties .",
    "this is reflected in three recent publications which all are based on the same set of @xmath0 data and the new five - loop results , which , however , arrive at significantly different estimates of higher order terms and hence of @xmath24 . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that fopt exhibits a poorly `` convergent '' series , in contrast to cipt , where a subset of higher order contributions ( so - called @xmath71-terms ) is automatically summed .",
    "this analysis leads to @xmath72 .",
    "the small theory uncertainty is a consequence of the ( artificially ) reduced @xmath17-dependence and the restrictive assumptions about higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the opposite viewpoint has been advocated in @xcite where an explicit and plausible behaviour of the perturbative series is modelled .",
    "strong cancellations are observed between the aforementioned @xmath71-terms and those terms which can only be obtained from a concrete higher order calculation .",
    "all these papers are based on similar assumptions about non - perturbative power - suppressed contributions .",
    "these assumptions have been questioned in @xcite , employing different weight functions in order to suppress these poorly determined terms with dimension @xmath73 .",
    "a significantly smaller result , @xmath74 , is obtained within cipt . in total the spread among the different results is covered reasonably well by eq .",
    "( [ als_tau ] ) .",
    "last not least it is instructive to compare eqs .",
    "( [ alpha_mz_new ] ) and ( [ eq : asres_mz ] ) with @xmath24 determinations based on lattice simulations .",
    "the most recent results from a precision simultaion by the hpqcd collaboration @xcite @xmath75 and from a study @xcite based on essentially the same lattice data and an alternative perturbative analysis , @xmath76 are in mutual agreement , as should be expected because they are based on a similar set of data .    remarkably enough , a completely different approach @xcite , which exploits the lattice simulation of the pseudoscalar correlator and which has been mentioned already above leads to @xmath77 again well consistent with the other determinations .",
