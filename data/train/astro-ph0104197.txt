    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show an array of phenomenology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "they are prodigious producers of energy at all wavelengths and the reprocessing of their intrinsic emission and competing sources of emission often complicates the interpretation of their phenomenology .",
    "what pieces of their observed phenomenology is really intrinsic to the agn and which are due to extinction , scattering , reprocessing , or competing phenomenon like the formation and evolution of massive stars ? to determine the properties of the agn implies that we must observe them over a wide range of wavelengths and at high spatial resolution to be able to spectrally and spatially segregate various emission mechanisms intrinsic to the agn and those which are extrinsic , and thus competing , sources of emission .",
    "recent work has demonstrated that star - formation near the nucleus can contribute significantly to the optical  uv spectra of seyfert nuclei .",
    "iue spectra and hst imaging have been used to infer that only a fraction of the uv continuum observed in seyfert  2 galaxies is actually due to a hidden agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in red optical spectra of seyfert  2 galaxies",
    ", @xcite found that the equivalent widths of the calcium triplet lines ( @xmath48498 , 8552 , 8662 ) were similar to those in the bulges of normal galaxies . in a moderately large aperture near - ir absorption line study of a sample of seyfert  1s and 2s , @xcite have found that many seyfert  2 galaxies show evidence for young or intermediate age populations while such populations are rare ( or non - existent ) in seyfert  1 nuclei .",
    "but overall they find that both these young and old populations contribute significantly to the central near - ir emission from seyfert galaxies .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy and imaging have a unique role to play in advancing our understanding of the agn phenomenon .",
    "this role reveals itself in several important and unique aspects of near - ir data .",
    "first , the near - ir possess many emission lines and stellar absorption features that are useful for determining the age and metallicity of the nuclear stellar population ( like the strong co bandheads in the h- and k - bands ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . second , extinction by dust declines rather substantially from the uv through the optical out to the near - ir .",
    "thus observations in the near - ir allow one to probe depths unreachable with data obtained at shorter wavelengths .",
    "third , compared to the continuum generated by stars , confusing sources of emission due to the reprocessed emission from the agn are also less significant in the near - ir .",
    "the emission from giant and supergiant populations peaks at about 1.6 @xmath2 m and is thus easier for a moderately young ( @xmath510@xmath6yr ) population to dominate all other emission mechanisms in the near - nuclear environment , including reprocessing of nuclear continuum by dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , compared to the optical or uv wavelength regimes . in the uv and blue optical ,",
    "the dust scattering efficiency is high enough and the recombination continuum strong enough to easily dominate the emission from the underlying stellar population .",
    "thus even with high spatial resolution and/or heavy obscuration diminishing the light from agn might not be enough to allow one to investigate the stellar population of the nucleus unhindered by contamination from agn emission at these wavelengths .",
    "taking advantage of these unique characteristics of near ir data with regards to investigating the stellar populations of active galactic nuclei , we undertook a comprehensive near - ir ( h- and k - band ) investigation of a large sample of seyfert and liner galaxies .",
    "this paper presents the resulting h- and k - band integral field spectroscopic data from our sample of 31  seyfert and liner galaxies .",
    "in addition to the strength of the near - ir data generally , integral field spectroscopy uniquely allows us to investigate the spatially resolved stellar populations of the nuclei of modest power agn and to investigate the distribution of the near - nuclear emission line gas .",
    "thus unlike most studies conducted to date on the near - ir nuclear properties of seyfert galaxies , we do not have to exclusively rely on large entrance apertures to investigate these properties .",
    "the sample selection and characteristics is discussed in  2 , the data reduction in  3 , some of the results are briefly discussed in  4 and what is known in the literature about each of our sample galaxies is described in  5 .",
    "we defer discussion of the emission line and stellar absorption line properties for now and limit ourselves to a description of the sample and how the data were obtained and reduced .",
    "the galaxies chosen for this program were selected to span as broad a range of nuclear magnitudes and optical line characteristics as possible and still be classified as seyfert or liner galaxies .",
    "these galaxies were selected from the compilation of @xcite . however , due to limitations of the available observing time , the weather during the scheduled observing time , and the locations of the various observatories where the data were taken , the exact sample was a randomly selected subsample of our entire list of active galaxies .",
    "our observed sample of galaxies is given in table  1 .",
    "the initial classification criterion adopted to select our galaxies was to adopt the classical spectroscopic definition of a seyfert nucleus , namely , a ratio [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath7@xmath53 .",
    "overall , 22 of our observed sample fits this criterion and in fact , 16 galaxies have [ oiii]/h@xmath7 @xmath5 5 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "however , six galaxies had an observed ratio lower than 3 , and a further two did not have reliable measurements in the literature .",
    "although these sources do not meet our strict selection criteria they are still useful for comparison purposes . specifically , these six are ngc1672 , ngc1433 , izw1 , mrk1044 , mrk315 , and ngc7582 , while ngc4945 and mrk231 did not have reliable [ oiii]/h@xmath7 mesurements .",
    "these cases are discussed in more detail below .",
    "after our initial selection , a more complete investigation of the nuclear spectral classification was conducted by searching the literature for line strength measurements . to make the classifications as robust as possible we searched for a wide variety of optical emission lines but principally focused on [ oii]@xmath13727 , h@xmath7 , [ oiii]@xmath15007 , [ oi]@xmath16300 , h@xmath8 , [ nii]@xmath1 6583 , and [ sii]@xmath46716 , 6731 .",
    "our specific selection of the lines to search for was based on the criteria outlined by @xcite and @xcite . to make the comparison of the emission lines and line ratios as fair as possible",
    ", we tried where possible to ensure that the same apertures and slit position were used for all lines and checked for uniform reddening correction of the emission line ratios .",
    "further , they were checked to be approximately corrected for the effects of underlying absorption in the line strengths .",
    "finally , we sought uniform measurements of the emission line widths to distinguish between seyfert  1s and 2s . while these were our goals , due to a lack of data some compromises had to be made . in most cases , these measurements are internally consistent but not uniform across the entire sample ( e.g. , the apertures are not the same from galaxy to galaxy ) .",
    "to classify our galaxies , our compilation of optical emission line ratios was used together with diagnostic criteria from @xcite and @xcite . for almost all of the galaxies in our sample the available data",
    "allows us to determine their position in at least two of the diagnostic diagrams . in those cases where the resulting classification differs from one diagram to the other ,",
    "greater weight was given to the classification derived from the [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath7 _ vs. _  [ nii]@xmath16583/h@xmath8 ( figure  1 ) and [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath7 _ vs. _  [ sii]@xmath16716+@xmath16731/h@xmath8 diagrams , as these lines are strong , and the ratios are only marginally affected by reddening .",
    "the diagrams involving [ oii]@xmath13727/[oiii]@xmath15007 and [ oi]@xmath16300 were given a lower weight owing to the strong reddening uncertainties in the former case , and the relative weakness of the line in the latter case .    in table  2",
    "we show the values for the ratios ( corrected , with few exceptions , for reddening and underlying stellar absorption ) , over a range of apertures typically of the order of a few arcseconds centered on the nucleus .",
    "the seyfert type is chosen as 1 , 1.5 or 2 according to the width of the hydrogen lines .",
    "we opted not to further subclassify our sample .",
    "a classification of seyfert  1.5 was chosen when clear signs of underlying broad component on a narrow line was found on the literature . in cases of doubt",
    "the conservative route was taken and the galaxy was designated as either a `` pure '' seyfert  1 or a `` pure '' seyfert  2 .",
    "widths broader than about 1200  km  s@xmath9 were chosen for the classification as type  1 , less than about 800  km  s@xmath9 for type 2 . between those two values we used the narrowest and broadest measured line width to `` tip the balance '' to one class or the other .",
    "our final classifications are provided in column  8 of table  2 .",
    "there are a few sources which did not meet our original [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath7@xmath53 selection criteria . in the cases of ngc1433 and ngc1672 ,",
    "our adopted classification is liner ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and   5.11 and   5.13 , respectively ) .",
    "izw1 and mrk1044 have properties and line ratios like `` narrow - line seyfert  1s '' ( nls1 ) and we adopt this classification ( see   5.2 and   5.4 , respectively , for details ) .",
    "mrk315 and ngc7582 , on the other hand , show strong signs of harboring seyfert nuclei but probably also host significant starbursts which greatly affect their nuclear emission line properties ( see   5.30 and   5.31 ) . for those cases",
    "we have adopted the classifications of seyfert  1.5/hii and seyfert  2/hii , respectively .",
    "the classification of ngc4945 is particularly controversial .",
    "a vigorous debate is underway about whether or not ngc4945 harbors an agn . for mrk231",
    "no line ratios are listed , anyway , the seyfert  1 classification was adopted based on the information available in the literature .",
    "these arguments are discussed in more detail in  5 .",
    "overall , our sample contains approximately equal numbers of seyfert  1s and 2s , with a few liners or possible liners .",
    "thus our final sample meets our competing goals of comparing the near - infrared characteristics of active galaxies over a broad range of nuclear magnitudes , optical emission line properties , and x - ray properties ( which means some `` weak agns '' like liners should be included ) and providing a robust comparison between seyfert  1s and 2s ( i.e. , roughly equal numbers should be observed ) .",
    "since we are interested in comparing the physical properties of these galactic nuclei in detail , the distances adopted in this paper require discussion .",
    "for the most distant galaxies , a simple hubble distance ( d(mpc ) = v@xmath10/h@xmath11 ) after correcting the observed recession velocities to the microwave background restframe ( v@xmath10 ) was adopted .",
    "a value for @xmath12 of 75  km  sec@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 was adopted for this work , and the observed heliocentric velocities ( taken from the rc3 @xcite ) have been corrected following the work of @xcite . from cobe observations ,",
    "@xcite find the velocity of the background dipole to be @xmath13 towards @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( j2000 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the velocity relative to the microwave background , @xmath18 is the observed heliocentric velocity , and ( @xmath8,@xmath19 ) are the j2000 coordinates of the source .",
    "the velocities in the microwave background frame are listed in table  1 .    of course ,",
    "correcting for the solar peculiar velocity is only appropiate for sources that are in the hubble flow .",
    "for example , for galaxies with peculiar velocities as large as that derived for the correction between heliocentric and microwave background frames would imply an error of @xmath205mpc .",
    "since such an uncertainty would be significant for galaxies within about 20mpc , we have searched for independent distance estimates for galaxies within 20mpc with which to compare with our simple hubble law distances .",
    "our adopted distances and the sources for those distances are presented in table  1 . the mean adopted distances of our sample ( see   2.2 ) are @xmath21mpc , @xmath22mpc , and @xmath23mpc for seyfert classes 1 , 1.5 , and 2 , respectively . taken as a combined class , seyfert  1 and 1.5",
    "galaxies in our sample have a mean distance of @xmath24mpc , in fair agreement with that of the seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "as one of the goals of this program is to study the nuclear regions of seyfert galaxies , we would therefore like to investigate how the properties might depend on galactic morphological type .",
    "the morphological classifications are taken from rc3 @xcite .",
    "special care should be taken when using the classifications of the more distant galaxies since the photographic plates on which the rc3 classification was based can be biased against structures on the furthest galaxies . for completeness",
    ", the rc3 morphological types are shown in table  1 .",
    "imaging spectroscopy of the sample of seyfert galaxies was obtained using the mpe nir imaging spectrometer 3d .",
    "details of 3d are given by @xcite , and only a brief summary is presented here .",
    "3d uses a mirror image slicer to divide a square field - of - view into 16  slitlets , each 1  pixel wide and ( roughly ) 16  pixels long ( see  [ data reduction ] ) , which are subsequently arranged end - to - end in a staircase pattern to produce a long pseudo - slit .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the two spatial dimensions down to a single dimension .",
    "this pseudo - slit is then spectrally dispersed by passing it through a grism .",
    "the final , two - dimensional projection of the three dimensional ( two spatial , one spectral ) data is imaged onto a @xmath25  pixel nicmos  iii detector .    3d has a suite of 5  grisms , two of which can be used on any given observing run .",
    "the wavelength range and achieveble resolution for these grisms are listed in table  3 .",
    "prior to 1995 the data were sampled at somewhat less than the nyquist frequency , resulting in spectral resolutions @xmath26 lower than those listed in table  3 .",
    "after that date , a piezo - driven mirror was implemented which is used for half - pixel spectral dithering to realize the full resolution provided by the grisms .",
    "starting in july 1994 , 3d was used in conjunction with a tip - tilt corrector rogue @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to achieve spatial resolutions which were considerably better than the longterm seeing values .",
    "in addition , rogue carries with it a pixel scale changing feature which allows observers to take full advantage of changing seeing conditions .",
    "the pixel size for all observations ( including those prior to july 1994 ) ranged from 0.25@xmath27 to 0.5@xmath27 resulting in fields - of - view between 4@xmath27 and @xmath28 and which depended on the seeing conditions and on which telescope the observations were taken .",
    "data were collected from november 1993 until april 1999 on various telescopes located in both the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "most of the data presented here were taken using the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "tables  4 and 5 summarize the circumstances of the observations .",
    "the spatial resolution listed in table  5 is that achieved through the use of rogue , and represents a lower limit to the actual nir seeing at the time of the observations .    in a typical observation ,",
    "the telescope was pointed alternatively to the object and the sky in the pattern sky - object - object - sky . within this pattern",
    ", half - pixel spectral dithering is performed between the two object exposures . as each on source exposure receives all the flux ,",
    "the total integration times listed in table  5 are the sum of all of the individual on source exposure times .",
    "the time per individual exposure was governed by our ability to successfully subtract the sky emission from the source exposures .",
    "thus , h - band exposures were typically 60  seconds long , while k - band times ranged between 100 and 140  seconds , depending on atmospheric conditions .",
    "since both the h- and k - bands are strongly contaminated by telluric absorption , observations of stars with featureless , or weak - lined , spectra in the h- and k - bands were observed to calibrate away the atmospheric lines . typically , for h - band measurements early type dwarfs or early f - type dwarfs were used , while for k - band observations late - f or early - g dwarfs were used . these calibrators",
    "were observed every 0.51  hour , depending on sky stability and the zenith distance of the observations .",
    "most of our targets were observed for long periods during one or more nights and all of these data were reduced independently for each night of observation .",
    "flatfield frames were taken usually at the beginning and/or at the end of the night",
    ". dome flats and internal lamp flats were taken , the first consisting of exposures of an illuminated portion of the dome , the latter consisted of exposures of a incandescent tungsten filament whose spectral shape was easily removed from the data . in practice ,",
    "the dome flats often had a spectral emissivity that was flat enough to provide a reasonable flatfield and were often used exclusively to flatfield the data .",
    "otherwise , combinations of internal and dome flats were used to flatfield the data .",
    "exposures of an argon and neon arc lamps were made to provide wavelength calibration of the h- and k - band respectively .",
    "these wavelength calibration exposures were taken every night and the final wavelength calibration were checked against the wavelengths of strong obvious night sky lines .",
    "dark exposures were obtained usually at the end of each run , in order to remove the ( small ) dark current contribution for each data frame .",
    "the data were reduced using the gipsy package @xcite , with additional 3d - specific routines which were written in - house .",
    "the data were first corrected for ( small ) deviations from linear response before subtracting the sky exposures from their corresponding object frames .",
    "the sky - subtracted source frames are flatfielded , and dead pixel corrected . at that point",
    "the individual spectrally dithered pairs are interleaved and the resulting frame is wavelength calibrated , using calibration files generated from the arc lamp exposures .",
    "from these two dimensional representations of three dimensional information data cubes are then generated .",
    "the non - integer slitlet lengths require spatial re - alignment by fractions of a pixel to obtain useful data cubes .",
    "sub - pixel interpolation is done using fourier interpolation for spatially well sampled data or by quadratic interpolation for less well sampled data .",
    "the data cube is then resampled onto a finer grid scale for more precise centering of individual source frames with respect to each other .",
    "the pixel representing the center of each frame is chosen to be the peak pixel within a broadband image ( i.e.  an image generated by collapsing the cube ) .",
    "the fine - tuning of the peak position is then achieved by assuming that the flux distribution very near the peak is gaussian in nature and the shifting the image such that the peak of a fitted gaussian lies at its center .",
    "the set of re - registered source frames are then combined into a final data cube .",
    "the final reduction step is to remove the telluric absorption from the object spectrum .",
    "the data for the atmospheric calibrator are reduced in exactly way as for the object .",
    "the extracted one - dimensional spectrum of the atmospheric calibrator is divided into the object data cube .",
    "calibration was done by using aperture magnitudes available from the literature ( see table  5 ) and appropriately scaling our spectra extracted over the same projected aperture .",
    "we defer a detailed analysis of the full set of data to later papers . here",
    "we would like just to characterize the quality and gross features of the data set .",
    "having three dimensional data for a large number of seyfert galaxies allows us access to a variety of diagnostic display methods .",
    "the first of these methods is one in which aggregate spectra over some portion of the source are generated .",
    "for example , a seeing - weighted combination of individual spectra within the cube centered on the h- or k - band continuum peak can be made .",
    "figure  2 , shows 3  spectra for each galaxy : one seeing - weighted , one which is the sum of the data within an aperture of diameter 3  or 4  centered on the h- or k - band peak continuum emission and another one which is the difference between the larger aperture and the seeing - weighted spectra . in each case , the apertures chosen were determined by the seeing during the observations and/or the field - of - view of the data . for those cases where",
    "the field is dominated by a strong central pointlike source , the seeing weighted spectrum can be regarded as the `` nuclear spectrum . ''",
    "measured fluxes of strong h- and k - band emission lines , as well as broadband fluxes , derived from the nuclear spectra , spectra of data within a 2  diameter aperture ( not shown ) , and the larger aperture ( either 3  or 4 ) spectra are provided in tables  6 , 7 , and 8 .",
    "surprisingly , about half of the nuclear spectra are in fact dominated by the stellar population of the nucleus , and not by the agn continuum .",
    "the fraction of galaxies whose nuclear spectra are dominated by a `` diluting continuum '' ( relative to the stellar absorption line strengths ) is a function of seyfert type , with seyfert  1s preferentially showing more dilution .",
    "however , both seyfert  1s and 2s exhibit highly diluted nuclear spectra ( e.g.  ngc1068 , a seyfert  2 ) and both classes also exhibit nuclear spectra that are dominated by their underlying bulge populations ( e.g.  ngc1566 , a seyfert  1 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the emission lines in most of the nuclei are very low ( br@xmath3 equivalent widths are rarely above 10 ) . however , those nuclei with high br@xmath3 equivalent widths are preferentially seyfert  1s .",
    "many of the galaxies have blue continua in both the nuclear and large aperture spectra suggesting that they are dominated by stellar continuum emission , which must not be heavily extincted .",
    "the second means of looking at the data involves collapsing it spectrally , either over the entire band ( either with or without the inclusion of lines ) or over a line ( with or without the inclusion of local continuum ) . in figure  3",
    "we present the spatially resolved maps of the h- and k - band continua , and emission line maps of [ feii]@xmath11.644@xmath2 m , h@xmath29 ( including all detected h@xmath29 lines in the k - band ) , and br@xmath3 .",
    "the continuum maps were constructed by excluding strong emission lines ( [ feii ] in the h - band , br@xmath3 and h@xmath29 lines in the k - band ) .",
    "in addition , the k - band images include only wavelengths shortward of the co bandheads at 2.29@xmath30 m .",
    "thus , these are `` continuum only '' images .",
    "the [ feii]@xmath11.644@xmath2 m , h@xmath29 , and br@xmath3 emission line maps were constructed by including only those spectral channels that included significant line emission .",
    "the line maps have been continuum - subtracted . in addition , the line maps have been spatially truncated such that only those pixels that are @xmath31 above zero are included in our plots .",
    "each map shows data for which we are confident that the displayed morphology is statistically significant .",
    "thus images not displayed for [ feii ] ( when h - band data were available ) , br@xmath3 , or h@xmath29 for any galaxy implies that the source lacked significant emission in those lines or that the signal to noise ratio was not good enough to create an image . the h- and",
    "k - band continuum maps display the entire spatial dimensions of the data cube and have not been truncated in size .",
    "there is a wide range of morphologies in emission line maps , from point like sources to more extended diffuse sources . interestingly , in the continuum maps there are also a wide range of morphologies in the sense that some images are obviously dominated by emission from a point source , while other tend to be more diffuse and have no evidence for harboring a point source .",
    "a comparison of an aperture spectra and continuum maps reveals that those sources with evidence for strong point source emission also show diluted stellar continuum .",
    "the presence of a nuclear point source is a function of the seyfert type , but some seyfert  1 s showing no such point source and some seyfert  2 s exhibiting strong evidence for a point source .",
    "this is similar to what was found when considering the degree to which the nuclear spectra were diluted .",
    "the distance distribution of seyfert 2s is similar to that of seyfert 1s and 1.5s ( see   2.3 ) , thus this result is independent of any distance bias of the object types .",
    "in this section we provide a brief synopsis of the observational characteristics of each object within our study as gleaned from the literature , focusing particularly on the circum - nuclear properties of each galaxy .",
    "special emphasis was given to other near - ir observations and other direct evidence for the existence and properties of the active nucleus .",

    "recent star formation in the nuclear region has been detected through the near - ir observations of @xcite , who find that the luminosity due to starformation within the central few hundred parsecs is comparable to the agn luminosity , though the central 14pc ( converted to our adopted distance ) is dominated by the agn luminosity , with starformation contributing only 2% of the light .",
    "additional evidence for a nuclear starburst is also provided by the morphology of extended h@xmath8 emission , produced as a result of a nuclear `` superwind '' ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite can not spatially resolve the starburst ring in their _ rosat _ hri data but derive its x - ray luminosity by using the results of the radio observations of @xcite together with the assumption that its @xmath70 ratio is typical of starbursts ( @xmath0400 ) .",
    "they then arrive at the conclusion that only 4% of the total x - ray luminosity is produced in the ring .",

    "the origin for this feature , which is seen only in [ oiii ] and h@xmath8 ( but see also * ? ? ?",

    "ngc7582 presents a fascinating puzzle .",
    "it is a classical seyfert  2 galaxy , with a well - defined [ oiii ] cone @xcite and normally narrow emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "its lack of broad lines in spectropolarimetric observations coupled with a high 60@xmath30m/25@xmath30 m flux ratio led @xcite to infer that the nucleus itself is totally obscured , even to scattered light , by an edge - on thick torus surrounding it .",
    "this is also consistent with the results of _ ginga _ observations of ngc7582 @xcite .",
    "that stars contribute to the nuclear luminosity of ngc7582 has been demonstrated by the work of @xcite .",
    "they find , through observations of strong co bandhead absorption lines and an inferred large near - ir light - to - mass ratio that young supergiants are present and dominate the h- and k - band nuclear luminosity ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "* who find , based on spectral synthesis fitting to optical spectra , that only 6% of the optical light is due to young stars ) .",
    "there is also a kiloparsec - scale disk of hii regions surrounding the nucleus @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite report on the detection of hitherto unseen broad lines in the optical spectra , effectively for a few months turning this classical seyfert  2 galaxy into a seyfert  1 galaxy .",
    "these authors debate the pros and cons of three models to explain the sudden appearance of the broad lines : the capture of a star by a nuclear black hole , a reddening change in the surrounding obscuring torus , and the radiative onset of a type  iin supernova .",
    "the first two of these models deal directly with the active nucleus and its obscuring surroundings , while the last model invokes pure stellar processes .",
    "@xcite raise serious concerns with the first two models , and favor the sn theory .",
    "evidence in favor of a nuclear - based explanation comes from the _ bepposax _ observations of @xcite .",
    "they observed ngc7582 in 1998  november and found a previously unseen hard x - ray component .",
    "correlated variability across the x - ray spectrum led @xcite to the conclusion that a single component dominates the 2100kev band .",
    "further , these variations do not seem to be at all correlated with those in the optical reported on by @xcite .",
    "ngc7582 was observed twice in the k - band , once before and once just after the optical anomaly .",
    "the second set of observations were done after the anomaly was brought to our attention ( r.  terlevich , private communication ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis of our observations will be presented in a subsequent paper , but here we note simply that our second observations show a broadening of the br@xmath3 line , along with a reddening of the continuum in the seeing weighted aperture .",
    "our observed br@xmath3 equivalent width for the 1994 july eso 2.2 m observations agrees well with that obtained by @xcite who also observed ngc7582 during its `` quiescence . ''",
