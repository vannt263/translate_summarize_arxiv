    ", we produce canonical shift of finite type ( sft ) covers of williams @xmath1-solenoids in the following sense : let @xmath2 be a @xmath1-solenoid , @xmath3 a shift map on @xmath2 , and @xmath4 a union of finitely many periodic orbits of @xmath3 .",
    "we give an algorithm which takes the input @xmath5 and produces as output a mixing sft @xmath6 with shift map @xmath7 and a semiconjugacy @xmath8 ( that is , @xmath9 is a continuous surjection and @xmath10 ) .",
    "then we prove that if there is a conjugacy @xmath11 of @xmath1-solenoids @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath11 sends @xmath4 to @xmath14 , then there is a unique conjugacy @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "these covers can be exploited to give nontrivial computable invariants distinguishing closely related solenoid maps .    to our knowledge",
    ", we are giving the first construction of canonical sft covers for a class of nonzero dimensional systems .",
    "the canonicalness requires the dependence on @xmath17 , and perhaps this is why it was not noticed earlier .",
    "however , there have been other works ( @xcite ) achieving some specialness or invariant for sft covers of some systems , and there were earlier constructions of canonical covers for some systems .",
    "krieger ( @xcite ) gave canonical sft covers of sofic systems ( which are zero dimensional ) , and fried ( @xcite ) more generally offered canonical coordinate ( cc ) covers of finitely presented ( fp ) systems .",
    "these covers are built from sets of possible pasts and futures .",
    "the krieger - fried covers make the step from fp to cc .",
    "the @xmath1-solenoids are already cc , and the covers we produce are sfts .",
    "we raise the question , can our relatively simple one - dimensional construction be generalized in some inductive way to produce canonical symbolic dynamics for higher dimensional generalized solenoids ?    apart from the matter of canonical symbolic dynamics , we mention renewed interest in williams systems and related systems on account of connections with ordered group invariants ( @xcite ) and substitutions and tilings ( @xcite ) .",
    "we study the @xmath1-solenoids as purely topological systems .",
    "for this we give some defining topological axioms closely related to williams axioms",
    ". a @xmath1-solenoid of williams becomes one of our @xmath1-solenoids by ignoring the differentiable structure .",
    "conversely , every topologically defined @xmath1-solenoid can be given a differentiable structure which makes it a @xmath1-solenoid in the sense of williams .",
    "however , the essential aspects of the situation are not differentiable but topological , and to clarify this we give the purely topological development .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "following williams ( @xcite ) rather closely , we give axioms for our systems and prove some basic facts about them .",
    "we also recall the construction of an sft cover from a graph presentation . in section 3 ,",
    "we recall williams definition of shift equivalence and show that every topological conjugacy of branched @xmath1-solenoids is induced by a shift equivalence of their graph presentations .",
    "( a ` branched ' solenoid is a solenoid derived from a presentation which need not satisfy williams flattening axiom , so this is a slight generalization of williams work . )",
    "we also establish a key observation : if the shift equivalence is given by graph maps ( maps sending vertices to vertices ) , then the conjugacy lifts uniquely to a conjugacy of the sft covers derived from the graph presentations . in section 4 ,",
    "given @xmath18 , we give a graph algorithm for a new graphical presentation @xmath19 of the solenoid system .",
    "one consequence of this construction is that every @xmath1-solenoid with a fixed point has an elementary presentation in the sense of williams , so this extends williams classification result ( @xcite ) to all @xmath1-solenoids with fixed points . in section 5 , we use the previous results to produce the canonical sft covers , and use them to distinguish the pair of systems considered by williams and ustinov ( @xcite ) by computing bowen - franks groups of certain attached canonical sft covers . in appendix",
    "a , we show that our canonical sft covers are not canonical as one - sided sfts , despite the one - sided aspects of the construction . in appendix b , we show that our topological @xmath1-solenoids can be given a differentiable structure making them differentiable immersions in the sense of williams .",
