    "the discovery of disks of dust around main sequence stars showed that some grain growth must have occurred in these systems , since this dust is short - lived and so must be continually replenished ( e.g. , backman & paresce 1993 ) ; the dust is thought to originate in a collisional cascade that starts with planetesimals a few km in size ( wyatt & dent 2002 ) .",
    "thus the lack of warm dust in the inner @xmath7 au of these systems implies a relative paucity of planetesimals in these regions ( laureijs et al .",
    "this would naturally be explained if the planetesimals here grew large enough for their gravitational perturbations to clear these regions of any remaining debris , i.e. , if they grew to @xmath8 km sized planets ( kenyon & bromley 2002 ) .",
    "while the presence of such planets is still questionable , it is widely believed that these debris disk systems are solar system analogs , and that the dust that is observed is produced by the destruction of analog kuiper belts ( wyatt et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the most positive indication that debris disk systems harbor planets comes from the morphology of the dust disks .",
    "all of the disks which have been imaged exhibit clumps and asymmetries which have been interpreted as perturbations from a planetary system : e.g. , a brightness asymmetry in the hr4796 disk ( telesco et al .",
    "2000 ) can be explained by the secular gravitational perturbations of a planet on an eccentric orbit ( wyatt et al .",
    "1999 ) ; clumps observed in the @xmath9 eridani , vega and fomalhaut disks ( holland et al . 1998 ; greaves et al . 1998 ; wilner et al . 2002 ; holland et al .",
    "2003 ) may be indicative of dust trapped in mean motion resonance with a planet in these systems ( ozernoy et al .",
    "2000 ; wyatt & dent 2002 ; quillen & thorndike 2002 ; kuchner & holman 2003 ) ; and a warp in the @xmath10 pictoris disk ( heap et al . 2000 ) may be caused by the perturbations of a planet on an inclined orbit ( augereau et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the possibility that clumps in debris disks are caused by dust trapped in planetary resonances .",
    "simple geometrical arguments show how material that is in such resonances is not evenly distributed in azimuth about the star it is orbiting ( e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 ; see  4 ) , and this observation has been exploited by several authors to use debris disk clumps to infer the presence of planets . in the studies currently in the literature ,",
    "dust is trapped into planetary resonances when it encounters these resonances while spiraling in towards the star due to p - r drag , much in the same way that dust originating in the asteroid belt becomes trapped in resonance with the earth ( dermott et al .",
    "1994 ) , and dust originating in the kuiper belt might become trapped in resonance with neptune ( moro - martn & malhotra 2002 ) . however , wyatt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that p - r drag is not important for dust in the bright debris disks that are currently known , since these are much denser than the zodiacal cloud or the putative kuiper belt dust cloud .",
    "this means that debris disk dust is destroyed in mutual collisions much faster than the p - r drag timescale until it is small enough to be blown out of the system by radiation pressure .",
    "another reason why dust may be trapped in planetary resonances is evident by comparison with the solar system .",
    "about one third of known kuiper belt objects ( hereafter kbos ) , including pluto , are trapped in 3:2 resonance with neptune ( jewitt 1999 ) .",
    "more recently kbos have also been found in neptune s other resonances , including the 1:1 , 4:3 , 7:4 , 2:1 , and 5:2 resonances chiang et al .",
    "these planetesimals are thought to have become trapped in these resonances when neptune s orbit expanded in the early history of the solar system ( malhotra 1995 ) . in this scenario",
    ", the orbital expansion arises from angular momentum exchange resulting from the scattering by neptune of the residual planetesimal disk left over at the end of planet formation ; the current orbital distribution seen in the kuiper belt can be explained by the migration of neptune from 23 - 30 au over a period of 50 myr ( hahn & malhotra 1999 ) . while this model does not completely describe the kbo distribution",
    ", it turns out that some of its puzzling features , such as the high inclination population of the classical kbos ( i.e. , those not trapped in resonance with neptune ) , can now be accounted for with more detailed models of the migration ( gomes 2003 ) .",
    "besides , the success with which it explains the orbital distribution of the resonant kbos means that the migration of neptune is almost certain to have played a role in the formation of the kuiper belt .",
    "furthermore , models of the formation of such massive planets in the absence of the substantial accretion of gaseous material predicts such migration ( fernndez & ip 1984 ) .",
    "thus if planets did form in the inner regions of debris disk systems , some fraction of the parent planetesimals from which the dust originates is expected to be trapped in resonance with the outermost planet of that system .",
    "current studies of planet migration and the consequent resonant trapping deal with the migration of neptune and its effect on the kuiper belt ( malhotra 1995 ; hahn & malhotra 1999 ; zhou et al .",
    "2002 ; chiang & jordan 2002 ) .",
    "this study is the first in a series which aims to determine the effect of planet migration in extrasolar systems . in such systems , planets of different mass",
    "may have formed at different distances from different mass stars ; they also may have migrated at different speeds .",
    "this paper explores the effect of planet migration on a planetesimal disk , while the details of how the planet achieves that migration and of the dust distribution resulting from the destruction of these planetesimals are left for future studies in the series .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "the numerical model of planet migration is described in  [ s : nm ] and in ",
    "[ s : rcp ] this is used to calculate the probability of capture of planetesimals into different resonances for given migration scenarios . ",
    "[ s : drp ] shows how the geometry of resonant planetesimal orbits causes their distribution to be clumpy and parameters defining this clumpiness are derived from the numerical simulations . in ",
    "[ s : dds ] i show how these results can be applied to the structure of debris disks using the specific example of the structure observed around vega to set constraints on the mass and migration history of planets in this system . the conclusions are given in ",
    "[ s : concl ] .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a system comprised of 200 planetesimals and 1 planet was followed using the radau fifteenth order integrator program ( everhart 1985 ) .",
    "this integration scheme is self - starting in that the time steps of each sequence are variable and are chosen by the integrator based on the results of the previous sequence ; substeps within each sequence are taken at gauss - radau spacings .    in these integrations",
    "all bodies are assumed to orbit a star of mass @xmath11 .",
    "the planet has a mass of @xmath0 while the planetesimals are assumed to be massless , i.e. , they do not affect the evolution of the planet s orbit though they are affected by it . at the start of the integration , the planetesimals are assumed to have eccentricities , @xmath12 , chosen randomly from the range 0 to 0.01 .",
    "their inclinations , @xmath13 , were chosen randomly from the range 0 to @xmath14 rad , and their arguments of periastron , @xmath15 , longitudes of ascending node , @xmath16 , and longitudes , @xmath17 , were each chosen randomly from the range 0 to @xmath18 . the planet was assumed to have all of these orbital parameters set to zero at the start of the integration ; i.e. , the planet starts on a circular orbit in the mid - plane of the planetesimal disk .",
    "the initial semimajor axes of the planetesimals , @xmath3 , and that of the planet , @xmath19 , were set according to the integration being performed .",
    "planet migration was simulated by the addition of a force acting in the direction of orbital motion of the planet .",
    "the prescription for the force used in this paper has as its input the variable @xmath20 and results in an acceleration of : @xmath21 since the work done by this force results in a change in orbital energy ( see e.g. , section 2.9 of murray & dermott 1999 ) , this causes a change in the planet s semimajor axis of @xmath22 ; i.e. , the force defined by @xmath23 results in a constant rate of change in the planet s semimajor axis .",
    "the planet maintains its circular orbit ( @xmath24 ) in the midplane of the disk ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the integrator itself has been extensively tested , and the addition of planet migration was tested by repeating simulation ia of chiang & jordan ( 2002 ) .",
    "the resulting final distribution of eccentricities , inclinations and semimajor axes of planetesimals was qualitatively the same as that depicted in their figure 3 .",
    "planetary resonances are locations at which planetesimals orbit an integer @xmath26 number of times for every integer @xmath27 times that the planet orbits the star .",
    "kepler s third law shows that resonances occur at semimajor axes of : @xmath28 if the planet is migrating at a rate @xmath1 , these resonances only remain in the vicinity of planetesimals at a given semimajor axis for a short time .",
    "however , while close to a planetary resonance , a planetesimal receives periodic kicks to its orbit from the gravitational perturbations of the planet .",
    "these can impart angular momentum to the planetesimal so that its semimajor axis increases in such a way that the planetesimal is always orbiting at the location of the resonance ; such a planetesimal is said to be trapped in the planet s resonance .",
    "the resonant forces causing this trapping are discussed in greater detail in  [ s : drp ] .",
    "the first set of integrations was performed with the aim of determining how many planetesimals initially at a semimajor axis @xmath3 ( in the range 30 - 150 au ) get trapped in a given resonance of a planet of mass @xmath0 ( in the range 1 - 300 @xmath29 ) that is migrating at a constant rate of @xmath1 ( in the range 0.01 - 1000 au myr@xmath30 ) , where all bodies are orbiting a star of mass @xmath11 ( in the range 0.5 - 5 @xmath31 ) .",
    "studies of the migration of the solar system s planets showed that the most important resonances are the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances , and to a lesser extent the 4:3 and 5:3 resonances .",
    "these are studied in individual sections below , where a model is derived to estimate capture probabilities using equations ( [ eq : mu])-([eq : p2 ] ) and table [ tab : xyuv ] .",
    "readers not interested in how this model is derived could skip to  [ ss : tpsumm ] without much loss in continuity .",
    "the way the integrations were performed was to study specific values of @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 , then determine the trapping probability , @xmath32 , for different migration rates chosen with the aim of obtaining @xmath32 in the range 0.1 - 0.9 . trapping probabilities were determined by starting the planet at a semimajor axis d@xmath33 below the location of the resonance and allowing the integration to continue until the planet had migrated d@xmath34 beyond the resonance .",
    "the parameters d@xmath33 and d@xmath34 were chosen by monitoring the orbital elements of the planetesimals at 10 intervals throughout the integrations .",
    "since resonances have a finite libration width , d@xmath33 was chosen so that the planetesimals were started well outside the resonance region . at the end of all runs ,",
    "d@xmath34 was chosen so that two distinct populations of trapped and non trapped planetesimals were easy to distinguish by the semimajor axes and eccentricities of their members .",
    "typically both d@xmath33 and d@xmath34 were set between 0.5 - 4 au .",
    "the first runs were undertaken with @xmath35 and @xmath36 au .",
    "the nominal location of the planet for planetesimals at 60 au to be in its 3:2 resonance is @xmath37 au .",
    "trapping probabilities were determined for planet masses of 1 , 3 , 10 , 30 , 100 , and 300@xmath29 , and the results are plotted in figure [ fig:23mpl]a . for a given planet mass ,",
    "capture is assured as long as the migration rate is low enough . the capture probability is a strong function of the planet s migration rate , and the range of migration rates for which the capture probability is 0.1 - 0.9 is relatively small .",
    "such observations are consistent with analytical predictions ; e.g. , a sharp dependence on the migration rate is predicted by autoresonance theory ( friedland 2001 ) , and certain capture is expected in the adiabatic limit ( i.e. , when the migration rate is slow , see appendix [ app : adiabatic ] ) provided that the planetesimals eccentricities are low enough ( e.g. , henrard 1982 ; henrard & lemaitre 1983 ) .",
    "the higher capture probabilities found with more massive planets for any given migration rate are also expected , since their resonant gravitational perturbations are much stronger .",
    "a parametric fit to these trapping probabilities was performed that has the form : @xmath38^{-1 } , \\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the migration rate for which half of the planetesimals are captured , and the parameter @xmath40 determines how fast the turnover is from a capture probability of 0.9 to 0.1 ( e.g. , @xmath41 ) .",
    "these fits are also plotted in figure [ fig:23mpl]a .",
    "the parameters derived from these fits , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are plotted in figures [ fig:23mpl]b and [ fig:23mpl]c to show how they vary with the mass of the migrating planet . a linear regression fit to the logarithm of these parameters is also shown on these plots .",
    "thus it is found that the capture probability for the systems described in these runs can be approximated by equation ( [ eq : p ] ) with the following parameters : @xmath42 equation ( [ eq : a0.5mpl ] ) agrees well that the prediction from autoresonance theory that the critical migration rate should scale with @xmath43 ( friedland 2001 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gammpl ] ) shows that lower mass planets have a larger range of migration rates resulting in intermediate ( 0.1 - 0.9 ) capture probabilities .",
    "next the dependence of trapping probabilities on the planetesimals semimajor axis was tested by performing a set of runs with @xmath35 and @xmath44 , and placing the planetesimals at semimajor axes of 30 , ( 60 ) , 100 , and 150 au .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig:23a ] , where i have also plotted fits to the capture probabilities and to the derived parameters in the same manner as in  [ sss:23mpl ] .",
    "in this way the trapping probability is found to depend on @xmath3 in the sense that @xmath45 .",
    "no dependence of @xmath40 with @xmath3 was found ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "finally , the dependence of trapping probabilities on the stellar mass was tested .",
    "this was achieved with a set of runs with @xmath44 and @xmath47 au , and trying different stellar masses of 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , ( 2.5 ) , and 5.0@xmath31 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig:23ms ] , where fits to the capture probabilities and to the derived parameters are also plotted ( see e.g. ,   [ sss:23mpl ] and [ sss:23a ] ) . in this way the trapping probability is found to depend on @xmath11 in the sense that @xmath48 . a weak dependence of @xmath49 was also found .      from the previous sections ,",
    "it is evident that the trapping probability depends only on the dimensionless parameters : @xmath50 where @xmath6 determines the gravitational strength of the planet s resonance , and @xmath51 is the ratio of the planet s migration rate to the planetesimal s orbital velocity , which determines the angle at which the resonance is encountered . in perspective",
    ", a migration rate of 1au myr@xmath30 for a @xmath52 star corresponds to meeting the orbital velocity at 100 au at an incident angle of 03 .",
    "] thus the probability that planetesimals orbiting a star of mass @xmath11 ( in @xmath31 ) at a semimajor axis @xmath3 ( in au ) get captured into the 3:2 resonance of a planet of mass @xmath0 ( in @xmath29 ) that is migrating at a rate @xmath1 ( in au myr@xmath30 ) at a semimajor axis of @xmath53 can be approximated by : @xmath54^{-1}.    \\label{eq : p2}\\ ] ]    armed with this knowledge , the results of all the runs in   [ sss:23mpl]-[sss:23ms ] were reanalysed to determine @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "a least squares fit to equation ( [ eq : p2 ] ) was used to obtain best fit values of : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the errors in these parameters are estimated to be @xmath63 and 0.1 respectively .",
    "this model for @xmath32 was found to be accurate to about @xmath64 over the range of parameters tried in these runs .",
    "translating back to the lexicon of equations ( [ eq : p])-([eq : gammpl ] ) , which can be compared with the parameters derived from figs .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) : @xmath65 thus the results derived in  [ sss:23mpl ] have not changed by the inclusion of the runs in   [ sss:23a ] and [ sss:23ms ] .",
    "the same process was then repeated for the 2:1 resonance , except that now that the scaling law is known , only the equivalent runs of  [ sss:23mpl ] needed to be performed .",
    "the results of runs with @xmath66 and @xmath67 au for different mass planets are shown in figure [ fig:123435mpl]a . by varying @xmath68 rather than reducing @xmath1 ,",
    "this is not the case , since the integrator chooses a stepsize that is @xmath69 and integration length is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 . ]",
    "fits of the form given in equation ( [ eq : p ] ) were performed for each planet mass and fits to the variation of the derived parameters with @xmath0 were also performed .",
    "the resulting parameters were used to make initial estimates of the equivalent parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 in equation ( [ eq : p2 ] ) .",
    "a least squares fit to the capture probabilities then found these parameters to be @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , with respective errors estimated to be @xmath81 , and 0.1 .",
    "this model for @xmath32 is shown on figure [ fig:123435mpl]a with dotted lines and is accurate to about @xmath82 .",
    "the results for different resonances are summarized in table [ tab : xyuv ] .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the functional form of the capture probabilities for the two resonances are very similar and differ significantly only in the parameter @xmath83 , which determines the strength of the resonance .",
    "this numerical study finds that the 2:1 resonance is about 16 times weaker than the 3:2 resonance .",
    "this is close to the factor of 12 predicted by autoresonance theory ( friedland 2001 ) .      the same analysis as for  [ ss:12 ]",
    "was then repeated for the 4:3 and 5:3 resonances using runs with planetesimals orbiting initially 30 au from a @xmath84 star .",
    "the results are plotted in figures [ fig:123435mpl]b and [ fig:123435mpl]c , and the parameters derived from these results given in table [ tab : xyuv ] .",
    "again i find that for the 4:3 resonance , the values of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are similar to those of the other first order resonances ( i.e. , those with @xmath88 ) . also , @xmath89 is close to that anticipated from autoresonance theory ( i.e. , that the 4:3 resonance is @xmath90 times stronger than the 3:2 resonance ) .",
    "the values of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the second order ( @xmath91 ) 5:3 resonance are somewhat different to those of the first order resonances ; there is a steeper dependence of the strength of the resonance on the planet mass , and the range of migration rates for intermediate trapping probabilities is greater for a given planet mass . in general second order resonances are expected to be weaker than first order resonances , which is borne out by the higher value of @xmath83 .",
    "the trapping probabilities derived in the last subsections are summarized in figure [ fig : tpsumm ] .",
    "this shows , for the four resonances that were studied , the lines of 10 , 50 , and 90% trapping probability in terms of the migration parameters @xmath51 and @xmath6 . for planetesimals at a given semimajor axis",
    "any given migration is defined by a single point on this figure .",
    "thus this figure quickly summarizes which resonances these planetesimals will end up in ( if any ) .",
    "planetesimals that are trapped in resonance are not evenly distributed around star , rather they congregate at specific longitudes relative to the perturbing planet .",
    "this can be understood by first considering the geometry of a generic resonant orbit (  [ ss : rg ] ) , and then considering the action of resonant forces (  [ ss : sr ] ) .",
    "i use these in  [ ss : numdrp ] to build up a model for resonant structure caused by planet migration , the parameters of which are determined from analysis of the numerical integrations described in  [ s : rcp ] .",
    "each of the panels in figure [ fig : res ] shows the path that a planetesimal orbiting at a semimajor axis corresponding to a planet s @xmath92 resonance ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : apq ] ] ) takes when plotted in the frame co - rotating with the mean motion of the planet .",
    "while these orbits are elliptical in the inertial frame , there are two obvious features in the rotating frame : ( i ) when the planetesimal reaches pericenter it must be at one of @xmath26 specific longitudes relative to the planet ; ( ii ) the planetesimal spends more time at relative longitudes close to those at which it is at pericenter , than to those at which it is at apocenter .",
    "the former occurs because by definition , the planetesimal s pericenter passages occur at longitudes relative to the planet incremented by @xmath93 from the previous passage , a pattern which repeats itself after @xmath26 of the planetesimal s orbits .",
    "the latter occurs because when the planetesimal is close to its pericenter , the rate of change of its longitude is more closely matched to that of the planet . for high eccentricity planetesimal orbits . ]    while the pattern shown in the panels in figure [ fig : res ] is unique , its orientation relative to the planet is not , since this is determined by the starting longitudes of the planet and planetesimal and the pericenter direction .",
    "this orientation can be defined using just one variable , the planetesimal s resonant argument : @xmath94 by definition , @xmath95 remains constant while a planetesimal is in resonance , since the increase due to @xmath96 is offset by the decrease due to @xmath97 .",
    "the resonant argument has a specific physical meaning which will be described in ",
    "[ ss : sr ] , but from a geometrical point of view it can be rewritten thus : @xmath98 ,    \\label{eq : phip}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the longitude of the planet when the planetesimal is at pericenter . in other words",
    ", @xmath100 defines the relative longitude when the planetesimal is at pericenter and so the orientation of the pattern .",
    "the influence of a planet s gravity is to perturb the orbits of planetesimals in the system .",
    "these perturbations can be written down as a sum of many terms described by the planetesimal s disturbing function , @xmath101 ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "analysis of the disturbing function shows that these perturbations are particularly strong at the geometrical resonance locations ( eq .  [ [ eq : apq ] ] ) , where terms in which @xmath96 and @xmath97 are combined in the form @xmath102 are amplified .    the resonances i will be discussing all involve terms including the angle @xmath95 defined in equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) .",
    "the relevant terms in the disturbing function , assuming the orbits of the planet and planetesimal are coplanar and that the planet has a circular orbit ( i.e. , the circular restricted three body problem ) , are : @xmath103,\\ ] ] where @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 are coefficients corresponding to the secular , resonant direct , and resonant indirect parts of the disturbing function respectively . the effect of these perturbations on the orbital elements of the planetesimal can be determined using lagrange s planetary equations ( e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , the variation in the planetesimal s semimajor axis and eccentricity are : @xmath108    a simple analysis of the consequence of resonant forces using the circular restricted three body problem shows that they make the resonant argument of a planetesimal librate about a fixed value ( i.e. , a sinusoidal oscillation ; murray & dermott 1999 ) : @xmath109 indeed , a planetesimal is defined to be in resonance if its resonant argument is librating rather than circulating ( i.e. , a monotonic increase or decrease ) .",
    "it is the fact that the resonant arguments of all planetesimals in the same resonance librate about the same value that causes their azimuthal distribution to be asymmetric .",
    "the angle about which @xmath95 librates , @xmath110 , can be understood by considering the geometry of resonance ( peale 1976 ; murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "most of the perturbations to a planetesimal s orbit occur at conjunction ( i.e. , when the planet and the planetesimal are at the same longitude ) .",
    "conjunctions which occur either at pericenter or apocenter confer no angular momentum to the planetesimal .",
    "however , conjunctions that occur before / after the planetesimal s apocenter ( and after / before the pericenter ) lead to a net decrease / increase in the planetesimal s angular momentum .",
    "this means that resonant forces push the conjunction towards apocenter .",
    "since the resonant angle can also be written thus : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the longitude at which the planet and the planetesimal have a conjunction , apocentric libration is one at which @xmath113 .",
    "the argument outlined above is not valid however for all resonances , just those with @xmath88 and @xmath114 . for a start , while conjunctions always occur at the same location in the orbit of the planetesimal for a @xmath88 resonance , conjunctions for @xmath91 resonances occur at two locations @xmath115 apart around the planetesimal s orbit .",
    "apocentric conjunctions would thus have to be followed by pericentric conjunctions . since the forces of the pericentric conjunction would be stronger than those at apocenter ,",
    "such libration is not stable .",
    "rather conjunctions for stable libration occur midway between pericenter and apocenter whence the forces from alternate conjunctions cancel , i.e. , @xmath116 .    also , while the resonant argument for the 2:1 resonance librates about @xmath115 for low eccentricity ( @xmath117 ) orbits , the libration center can take one of two values for higher eccentricity orbits , one with @xmath118 the other with @xmath119 ( so - called asymmetric libration ; beaug 1994 ; malhotra 1996 ; chiang & jordan 2002 ) .",
    "the physical explanation for this behavior is that perturbations to the orbits also occur when the planetesimal is at its pericenter , as well as when it is at conjunction .",
    "consider a 2:1 planetesimal which has a conjunction with the planet just before / after its apocenter .",
    "as already mentioned , the forces from the conjunction act to decrease / increase the planetesimal s angular momentum .",
    "now consider the forces acting on the planetesimal as it continues along the rest of its orbit . at",
    "first these forces act to increase its angular momentum , since the planet is in front of the planetesimal , but when the planet s longitude is @xmath120 in front of the planetesimal these forces decrease the planetesimal s angular momentum .",
    "since the planetesimal spends more time at longitudes relative to the planet close to its pericenter ( see figure [ fig : res ] ) , these forces do not exactly cancel around the orbit and there is a net increase / decrease in the planetesimal s angular momentum ( for conjunctions before / after apocenter ) .",
    "these forces are important for the @xmath121 resonances for which every pericenter passage occurs at the same longitude relative to the planet .",
    "stable libration for the 2:1 resonance occurs at a value of @xmath95 which is @xmath122 for which the angular momentum loss / gain at conjunction is balanced by its gain / loss at pericenter .",
    "including terms up to @xmath123 in the expansion of the disturbing function for the circular restricted three body problem , the appropriate semimajor axis evolution at @xmath124 is given by : @xmath125.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , the first two terms are the direct terms of the @xmath126 and @xmath127 resonances respectively , and the third term is the indirect term of the @xmath126 resonance .",
    "the physical interpretation of these terms is that the first two are from perturbations caused at conjunction , while the third term is from perturbations at pericenter .",

    "the discussion of the stable libration center in  [ sss : lc ] was based on the assumption that the resonant forces confer no angular momentum to the planetesimal .",

    "[ eq : adotres ] ] with @xmath95 replaced with @xmath110 ) implies that @xmath131      another consequence of the planet s perturbing forces is to link the evolution of a planetesimal s eccentricity to that of its semimajor axis .",
    "this means that the same resonant forces which cause a planetesimal s semimajor axis to increase while the planet s orbit is migrating out , also cause the planetesimal s eccentricity to increase .",

    "this was not the case ; a typical ( but not unique ) feature of the longitude distributions obtained was a double - peak superimposed on a random distribution .",

    "when an additional population of planetesimals at a different semimajor axis were introduced into a run , these were also captured into resonance and their longitude distribution was also double - peaked . however , at any one time , the peaks for the populations which originated at different semimajor axes occurred at different longitudes .",
    "further runs with planetesimals started with semimajor axes randomly chosen within a range , and their longitude distribution was indeed found to be random .",
    "since the planetesimals that end up in resonance originate from a range of semimajor axes , their longitudes can be assumed to be random after resonant trapping .",

    "the structure of the disk was recently mapped with even higher spatial resolution ( @xmath196 ) using millimeter interferometry ( koerner , sargent & ostroff 2001 ; wilner et al .",
    "while these observations were not sensitive to the larger scale structure , they did show that a significant fraction of the millimeter emission could be resolved into two clumps , one @xmath197 northeast of the star , the other @xmath198 southwest of the star , and that the northeast clump is brighter than that southwest .",
    "thus it appears that the submillimeter images are best interpreted as emission from an extended disk which is dominated by two roughly equidistant clumps of unequal brightness on opposite sides of the star .",
    "based on the discussion of  [ ss : gs ] , the migration zone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : migzones ] ) causing this structure can be narrowed down to zone di : two clumps of equal brightness could have been explained by planetesimals trapped in the 3:2 resonance ( zone c ) , or in equal numbers into the 2:1(u ) and 2:1(l ) resonances ( zones dii or eii ) , but the asymmetry indicates that one of the clumps is overpopulated , pointing to migration zone di or ei .",
    "further constraints are set by the lack of evidence for an additional 3 clump pattern rotated relative to the two clump pattern . while 3 clumps from the 4:3 resonance are inevitable , zone ei is ruled out as trapping of planetesimals into the 5:3 resonance in this zone means there are less available to be trapped into the 2:1(u ) resonance . in theory",

    "the final planet location , @xmath171 , was constrained to within @xmath209 au by the radial offset of the northeast clump .",
    "the contrast of the clumps as well as their morphology were then used to constrain the initial location of the planet , @xmath170 , and the migration rate , @xmath1 .",

    "however , @xmath1 could not be so well constrained , because the extent of the migration , and so @xmath170 , also has a large effect on the model structure , since this determines both the fraction of planetesimals in each resonance as well as their eccentricity distributions .",

    "the implications of this model are as follows .",
    "first of all the whole pattern is expected to orbit the star with the same period as the planet . as this",
    "is predicted to be at 65 au , the orbital period is 330 yr . since the clumps are @xmath195 from the star , their motion would be @xmath213 yr@xmath30 . with an absolute pointing uncertainty of @xmath214 from the james clerk maxwell telescope",
    ", such absolute motion would not be detectable for several decades in submillimeter images with current technology .",
    "however , it would be easier to detect the relative motion of the two clumps , since the position angle of this structure should vary at @xmath215 yr@xmath30 .",
    "the direction of the orbital motion presented in figure [ fig : vegaim ] is anticlockwise .",
    "however this solution is not unique , since the model is nearly symmetrical about the line joining the two clumps , and i could also have modeled the system with clockwise orbital motion , in which case the planet would be currently north of the star .",
    "such a model is shown in figure [ fig : vegaim2 ] ; there are only slight differences in the disk structure compared with figure [ fig : vegaim]b .",
    "the important point is that the brighter clump , corresponding to the 2:1(u ) resonant planetesimals , trails some @xmath216 degrees in longitude behind the planet .",
    "another implication of the model is that the emission distribution is much more intricate than that detectable with a @xmath193 beam .",
    "it is therefore interesting that in interferometric images of vega ( koerner et al .",
    "2001 ) , the northeast clump splits into three , with two lower level clumps straddling a brighter clump ; the brighter clump in the model presented in this paper is expected to be extended in longitude ( see figure [ fig : vegamod]b ) .",
    "this model also makes the prediction that a lower level three clump pattern exists from planetesimals in the 4:3 resonance .",
    "while two of the clumps almost blend with the two brighter clumps from the 3:2 and 2:1 planetesimals , a faint clump is expected on the opposite side of the star from the planet . if the presence of such a clump could be inferred from higher resolution and sensitivity observations of this disk , the location of the planet and its direction of motion could be unambiguously determined .",
    "the mass and migration rate of the planet have been constrained to lie at the lower edge of zone di of figure [ fig : migzones ] , although an additional constraint is that the migration rate must be @xmath217 au myr@xmath30 for the 25 au migration to have been completed over the age of the system .",
    "thus the planet mass and migration rate i chose is not unique and must be determined by a study of the origin of the migration rate .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that in hahn & malhotra ( 1999 ) , neptune was found to migrate from 23 - 30 au over 50 myr in their model with an initial planetesimal disk mass of @xmath218 , a migration rate not too dissimilar to that chosen for this model . in other words ,",
    "the mass and migration rate of the planet causing the structure of vega s disk could be similar to the mass and migration rate of neptune in our own system .",
    "this similarity to the solar system is contrary to previous models for vega s disk structure , which was interpreted as dust grains migrating in toward the star due to poynting - robertson drag that get trapped into the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances of a 3 jupiter mass planet on an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.6 ( wilner et al .",
    "2002 ) .    as for the possibility of directly detecting this planet , observational constraints have recently been set on the presence of planets around vega , with an upper limit of @xmath219 at @xmath220 from the star ( metchev , hillenbrand & white 2003 ) .",
    "given its proximity to the bright star vega , it would be very difficult to detect this planet with current technology if it is indeed as small as @xmath221",
    ". a larger planet , with a necessarily much faster migration rate , may be detectable .      despite the complexity of the model , it is still just a first step toward a complete explanation of the structures which could be caused in extrasolar systems by planet migration .    for a start",
    ", the trapping probabilities were derived for migration through a dynamically cold disk ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the planetesimals eccentricities have a significant influence on trapping probabilities , which decrease as the eccentricities are increased , and also do not reach a maximum at 100% trapping probability for low migration rates if the eccentricity is above a certain threshold ( borderies & goldreich 1984 ; melita & brunini 2000 ) .",
    "most importantly , the trapping probabilities of different resonances are affected in different ways , with higher order ( @xmath222 ) resonances becoming more populated relative to lower order resonances for higher eccentricities . indeed chiang et al .  ( 2003 ) propose that the kuiper belt must have been dynamically hot ( @xmath223 ) when the migration of neptune occurred to explain the presence of three kbos in the 5:2 resonance given that only seven objects have been discovered in neptune s 2:1 resonance .",
    "it is difficult to predict an appropriate eccentricity distribution for the residual planetesimal disk .",
    "while planetesimals are thought to form in a dynamically cold disk , the sweeping of a planet s resonances and its secular perturbations , as well as scattering of planetesimals from closer to the star , can all contribute to increasing the average eccentricity of the planetesimal disk .",
    "certainly future models will have to consider the possibility of high eccentricities , but in doing so will become more complicated , since trapping into higher order resonances will also have to be considered .",
    "another omission of the model is stochastic effects .",
    "migration in the models of hahn & malhotra ( 1999 ) is not smooth , but shows large jumps .",
    "this is because the residual planetesimals used in their simulation had to be large to give reasonable integration times .",
    "if the most massive residual planetesimals causing migration are smaller than a certain limit , then stochastic effects can be ignored ( chiang et al .",
    "2003 ) , otherwise they must be characterized ( zhou et al .  2002 ) .",
    "one reason for anticipating that the residual planetesimals causing the migration are much smaller than the planet would be if the planet formed much closer to the star than the planetesimals .",
    "this could be the case if the planet was flung out in a gravitational interaction with other giant planets ( thommes et al .",
    "2002 ) or migrated out to a more distant location .",
    "possibly the most worrying aspect of the model is the translation of the distribution of planetesimals to the distribution of dust .",
    "these were assumed to be identical , but this may not be exactly true . for a start the radial location of the resonances are different for small dust , since they orbit the star slower than larger grains due to radiation pressure ( wyatt et al .",
    "also , these particles have different orbits from their parents , not only because of radiation pressure , but also due to the velocity given to them during the collision . the effect of p - r drag and subsequent collisions should also be taken into account .",
    "these are important issues , but ones which merit a paper in themselves . however , in defense of this assumption i will point out two things .",
    "first , the dust which contributes to the submillimeter images is expected to be large , since small grains emit very inefficiently at such long wavelengths ( wyatt & dent 2002 ) .",
    "second , most resonant planetesimals are on planet - crossing orbits ( i.e. , @xmath224 ) , and the only reason such orbits are stable is because resonant forces prevent a close approach (  [ s : drp ] ) .",
    "small dust originating from such planetesimals , but which is no longer in resonance , would therefore be expected to be short - lived , since without the protection of the resonance a close approach to the planet is possible resulting in scattering out of the system .",
    "such scattering is confirmed in more recent runs following the evolution of the dust particles orbits ( wyatt , in prep . ) .",
    "another concern is that the dust distribution may be affected by random events in which single massive planetesimals are disrupted .",
    "such events may have been witnessed in the structure of the zodiacal cloud ( dermott et al .",
    "2002 ; nesvorn et al .",
    "however , wyatt & dent ( 2002 ) concluded that inidividual collisions are unlikely to be a significant source of structure in the fomalhaut disk ( which also contains a clump , holland et al .",
    "2003 ) , since this disk is so massive that only a collision between two planetesimals at least 1400 km in diameter could affect its structure at the level observed , and too few such planetesimals can coexist in the disk . since vega s disk , and its clumps , have a similar mass to those of fomalhaut ( holland et al .",
    "1998 ) , i conclude that random collisions are also unlikely to be the cause of vega s clumpy disk structure .    while i prefer to leave the discussion of the origin of the planet s migration to a later paper , it is worth pointing out that only certain values of @xmath51 will be possible for a given planet mass @xmath6 and initial planetesimal disk mass ( hahn & malhotra 1999 ) . in other words , the planet s mass and migration rate , as well as the initial mass of vega s planetesimal disk",
    ", could be much better constrained with a model incorporating both migration and resonant trapping .",
    "also , in the models of the migration of the solar system s planets , neptune s migration is outward only because of the existence of the massive planets interior to its orbit .",
    "this is because the planetesimals scattered inwards by neptune ( causing its outward migration ) may not return for a subsequent scattering event ( causing inward motion ) due to their interaction with the closer in planets , whereas the converse is not true .",
    "thus an outward migration may be said to be indicative of at least two planets .",
    "however , ida et al .  ( 2000 ) presented an analytical model for planet migration claiming that once outward migration has started , it is self - sustaining , since there are automatically less planetesimals interior to the planet s orbit .",
    "i have presented a model describing the consequence of the outward migration of a planet on the dynamical and spatial structure of a planetesimal disk residing outside the planet s orbit . in ",
    "[ s : rcp ] numerical simulations were used to show how trapping probabilities into the 4:3 , 3:2 , 5:3 , and 2:1 resonances can be estimated to within 5% given just two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath225 .",
    "resonant forces cause a planetesimal s resonant argument , @xmath95 , to librate and in ",
    "[ s : drp ] physical arguments were used to explain what azimuthal structure is expected in the distribution of planetesimals as a result of this libration : planetesimals trapped in the 4:3 and 5:3 resonances are concentrated at 60 , 180 , and 300@xmath226 longitude relative to the planet , those in the 3:2 resonance are concentrated at @xmath178 longitude , and those in the 2:1 resonance are concentrated in two clumps associated with the 2:1(u ) resonance with a concentration at relative longitude of @xmath227 , and the 2:1(l ) resonance with a concentration at @xmath228 . also in  [",
    "s : drp ] , numerical simulations were used to show how the angle about which @xmath95 librates , as well as the amplitude of that libration , are affected by the migration parameters .",
    "these simulations also characterized the overpopulation of the 2:1(u ) resonance relative to the 2:1(l ) for different migrations . in ",
    "[ s : dds ] the numerical results were used to derive a numerical scheme to predict the spatial distribution of planetesimals resulting from a migration defined by @xmath6 and @xmath51 .",
    "it was shown that the dynamical structure of a post - migration disk can have one of seven states depending on the @xmath6 and @xmath51 of the migration .",
    "application of the model to the structure of vega s debris disk presented in holland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shows that its two clumps of unequal brightness can be explained by the migration of a neptune mass planet from 40 - 65 au over @xmath229 myr through a planetesimal disk initially extending from 40 - 140 au .",
    "the two clumps are caused by planetesimals trapped in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances , and the brightness asymmetry is caused by an overabundance of planetesimals in the 2:1(u ) resonance relative to the 2:1(l ) resonance . while the extent of the planet s migration is well constrained by the brightness of the clumps , its mass and migration rate are not unique , although they are constrained to lie within certain ranges defined by zone di in figure [ fig : migzones ] .",
    "further constraints on the planet s mass and migration rate , as well as on the mass of the planetesimal disk , would be possible by modeling the origin of the planet s migration in angular momentum exchange with the planetesimal disk .",
    "predictions of the model which may prove its validity are the orbital motion of vega s clumpy pattern ( @xmath215 yr@xmath30 ) , the location of the planet ( @xmath230 from the star , @xmath216 in longitude in front of the orbital motion of the ne clump ) , and the high resolution structure of the clumps including the presence of a fainter third clump on the opposite side of the star from the planet from planetesimals in the 4:3 and 5:3 resonances .",
    "while the mass and migration rate of vega s perturbing planet are not yet fully constrained , the migration parameters derived for neptune in the solar system ( hahn & malhotra 1999 ) are close to the small region of parameter space which could have caused vega s structure .",
    "there is also an intriguing suggestion that a planet s outward migration requires the presence of massive planets interior to its orbit .",
    "thus it seems possible that vega s planetary system is very similar to our own , not only in the presence and mass of the planets in its system , but in that system s early evolution .",
    "it is also possible that application of this model to the other clumpy debris disks may show these to harbor solar - like planetary systems .",
    "the weight of such conclusions is damped only by the limitations of the model .",
    "these will be addressed in future studies , and include questions about the extent the dust distribution follows that of the parent planetesimals , and how the conclusions are affected if the planetesimal disk is initially dynamically hot ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "i am very grateful to wayne holland for providing the published scuba observations vega .",
    "as a result of the fit to the libration of @xmath95 performed in  [ ss : numdrp ] , the libration period for each planetesimal , @xmath232 was also determined for all resonant planetesimals in each run , as was the mean libration period of the ensemble , @xmath233 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig : tphi ] .",
    "fits to these were performed of the form @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the orbital period of the planetesimal and @xmath236 except for the 2:1 resonance .",
    "these showed that @xmath237 and these fits are also shown on figure [ fig : tphi ] .",
    "so , the libration period for the 2:1 resonance is not affected by the planet s migration rate , but it does decrease during the migration as the planetesimal s eccentricity increases .",
    "however , for the 5:3 , 3:2 , and 4:3 resonances , the libration period is constant throughout the migration , but does depend on the @xmath6 and @xmath51 of the migration in that faster migrations ( and larger planet masses ) result in smaller libration periods .    the libration width for each planetesimal , @xmath238 ,",
    "was also measured , as was the mean libration width @xmath239 .",
    "since the runs for the 3:2 resonance showed that @xmath240 is not just dependent on @xmath6 and @xmath51 , but also on @xmath11 which was not varied for the other resonances , i only attempted to characterize the libration width for the 3:2 resonance ( see also figure [ fig : da ] ) : @xmath241 the mean libration widths for all resonances were used , however , to question the adiabaticity of this libration .",
    "adiabaticity is defined as when the libration period , @xmath232 , is much shorter than the time it takes for the resonance to cross the libration width , i.e. , @xmath242 .",
    "i found that in the runs shown here , @xmath243 was in the ranges : @xmath244 for the 3:2 resonance ; @xmath245 for the 4:3 resonance ; @xmath246 for the 5:3 resonance ; and @xmath247 for the 2:1 resonance .",
    "in other words , all the migrations considered in this paper satisfy adiabatic invariance ( henrard 1982 ) , though many are close to this limit .",
