    "this is confirmed recently by the ppb - bets balloon experiment  @xcite .",
    "it can be naturally explained by dark matter annihilation into electrons and positrons .",
    "the pamela collaboration has published their results showing an anomalous increase of the positron fraction in the energy range of @xmath3  gev  @xcite .",
    "all of these experimental results are possible indications of detection of dark matter . in this paper",
    ", we propose to explain all these experimental results in terms of a concrete particle physics model .",

    "@xcite , the kaluza klein ( kk)-parity keeps the lightest kk - odd particle stable and therefore also provides a dark matter candidate  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the explanation of dark matter experiments based on the ued model",
    ". however , in the minimal ued model , the dark matter candidate , kk - photon , is difficult to account for the pamela results because of their small annihilation rate to electrons and positrons in the galactic halo .",
    "recent studies have shown that the pamela results can be explained if the dark matter particles mainly annihilate into electron and positron pairs , and there exists a large boost factor to increase the annihilation cross section in the galactic halo  @xcite .",
    "the large boost factor can be obtained through the sommerfeld enhancement effect if there is a new long - range force attractive between two dark matter particles  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for other particle physics models that explain the pamela results ) .",
    "if the particle mediating the long - range force only couples to electrons , then the elastic scattering of dark matter on the electron may explain the dama results without contradicting the null results from other direct dark matter experiments like cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite .",
    "hence , additional ingredients are needed in the ued model . in this paper",
    ", we explore this possibility by studying the standard model singlet extension of the ued model ( sued ) .",
    "other than the standard model ( sm ) fields propagating in the 5-dimensional bulk , we introduce two new sm singlet fields : one fermion field and one scalar field .",
    "the zero mode of the fermion field @xmath5 plays the role of the right - handed neutrino and generates the neutrino majorana mass through the see - saw mechanism .",
    "the first kk - mode of the fermion field contains two weyl fermions with the lightest one called @xmath6 as the lightest kk - odd particle . to simplify our discussions , we only include one generation of right - handed neutrinos , while the generalization to more generations is staightforward .",
    "the zero mode of the scalar field @xmath7 is chosen to have a mass below 1 gev , which couples to the right - handed neutrino field through a renormalizable operator and hence provides a long - range force for the dark matter candidate @xmath6 . in order to explain the pamela results",
    ", we also couple the light scalar field @xmath7 to the electron field through a higher - dimensional operator and let @xmath7 mainly decay into a pair of electrons .",
    "the same coupling of @xmath7 to the electron field can also generate a large elastic scattering cross section betweeen @xmath6 and the electron to explain the dama results .",

    "we analyze the particle spectrum and identify @xmath6 as the lightest kk - odd particle and the dark matter candidate . in section  [ sec : relic ] , we calculate the relic abundance of the dark matter candidate .",
    "we also take the co - annihilation effects into account in this section .",
    "we illustrate how to accommodate the atic-2 , ppb - bets and pamela results , and the dama results in section  [ sec : pamela ] and [ sec : dama ] respectively . in section  [ sec : diffuse ] , we show how to evade the constraints from diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background today by making two kk - odd particles highly degenerate and lowering the kinetic decoupling temperature of the dark matter .",

    "<S> we propose a dark matter model with standard model singlet extension of the universal extra dimension model ( sued ) to explain the recent observations of atic , ppb - bets , pamela and dama . </S>",
    "<S> other than the standard model fields propagating in the bulk of a 5-dimensional space , one fermion field and one scalar field are introduced and both are standard model singlets . </S>",
    "<S> the zero mode of the new fermion is identified as the right - handed neutrino , while its first kk mode is the lightest kk - odd particle and the dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic ray spectra from atic and ppb - bets determine the dark matter particle mass and hence the fifth dimension compactification scale to be 1.01.6  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the zero mode of the singlet scalar field with a mass below 1  gev provides an attractive force between dark matter particles , which allows a sommerfeld enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section in the galactic halo to explain the pamela data . </S>",
    "<S> the dama annual modulation results are explained by coupling the same scalar field to the electron via a higher - dimensional operator . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the model parameter space that can satisfy the dark matter relic abundance and accommodate all the dark matter detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider constraints from the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background , which can be satisfied if the dark matter particle and the first kk - mode of the scalar field have highly degenerate masses . </S>"
