    "quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) structures with gapless electronic excitations , such as carbon nanotubes , quantum hall edge states , and confined states at the edge of a quantum well heterostructure ( i.e. , quantum wires ) , possess unique properties which can not be described by landau s fermi - liquid theory .",
    "even small electron - electron interactions in a 1d confinement make inadequate the picture based on the existence of long - lived fermionic quasiparticles which can be mapped onto single - particle states in a free - electron gas .",
    "a powerful framework for understanding universal properties of 1d electron systems was put forward by the formulation of luttinger - liquid ( ll ) theory.@xcite ( for a review see ref .  . )",
    "the spectral density , @xmath0 , of the one - electron green function in a luttinger liquid is fundamentally different from that of a fermi liquid : while the latter has one quasiparticle peak , the former has two singular peaks corresponding to the charge- and spin - density excitation modes.@xcite    tunnel - coupled quantum wires of high quality created at a cleaved edge of gaas / algaas double - quantum - well heterostructures appear to be an exceptional tool for probing spectral characteristics of a 1d system.@xcite it is achieved@xcite by measuring the differential conductance @xmath1  as a function of the voltage bias between the wires , @xmath2 , and magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the plane of the cleaved edge , @xmath3 , allowing for simultaneous control of the energy and momentum of the tunneling electrons . in a recent article@xcite we demonstrated that the picture of noninteracting electrons can be used with great success to explain some of the most pronounced features of the conductance interference pattern arising from the finite size of the tunneling region . taking electron - electron interactions into account was shown to explain experimentally observed long - period oscillation modulations in the @xmath2 direction , which can be understood as a moir pattern arising from spin - charge separation of electronic excitations . in this paper",
    "we use ll formalism to further investigate an interplay between electron correlations and the finite length of the tunnel junction , which allows us to understand peculiarities of the oscillations and the zero - bias anomaly in the measured tunneling conductance @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we describe the means by which we measure the tunneling conductance through a single isolated junction between two parallel wires .",
    "the two parallel 1d wires are fabricated by cleaved - edge overgrowth ( ceo ) , see fig .",
    "[ circuit ] and ref .  .",
    "initially , a gaas / algaas heterostructure with two closely situated parallel quantum wells is grown .",
    "the upper quantum well is 20  nm wide , the lower one is 30  nm wide and they are separated by a 6  nm algaas barrier about 300  mev high .",
    "we use a modulation doping sequence that renders only the upper quantum well occupied by a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a density @xmath4 and mobility @xmath5 .",
    "after cleaving the sample in the molecular beam epitaxy growth chamber and growing a second modulation doping sequence , two parallel quantum wires are formed in the quantum wells along the whole edge of the sample .",
    "both wires are tightly confined on three sides by atomically smooth planes and on the fourth side by the triangular potential formed at the cleaved edge .",
    "spanning across the sample are several tungsten top gates of width 2  @xmath6 that lie 2  @xmath6  from each other ( two of these are depicted in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] ) .",
    "the differential conductance @xmath7 of the wires is measured through indium contacts to the 2deg straddling tungsten top gates . while monitoring @xmath7 with standard lock - in techniques ( we use an excitation of @xmath8  @xmath9 at @xmath10  hz ) at @xmath11  k , we decrease the density of the electrons under the gate by decreasing the voltage on it ( @xmath12 ) . at @xmath13 ,",
    "the 2deg depletes and @xmath7 drops sharply , because the electrons have to scatter into the wires in order to pass under the gate . for @xmath14 the conductance drops stepwise each time a mode in the upper wire is depleted.@xcite in this voltage range , the contribution of the lower wire to @xmath7 is negligible because it is separated from the upper quantum well by a tunnel barrier . when @xmath15 , the upper wire depletes and only the lower wire can carry electrons under the gate .",
    "this last conduction channel finally depletes at @xmath16 and @xmath7 is suppressed to zero .",
    "the measurements are performed in the configuration depicted in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] .",
    "the source is the 2deg between two gates , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] , the voltages on which are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the upper wire between these gates is at electrochemical equilibrium with the source 2deg .",
    "this side of the circuit is separated by the tunnel junction we wish to study from the drain .",
    "the drain is the 2deg to the right of @xmath18 ( the semi - infinite 2deg in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] ) and it is in equilibrium with the right , semi - infinite , upper wire and with the whole semi - infinite lower wire in fig .  [ circuit ] .",
    "thus , any voltage difference ( @xmath2 ) induced between the source and the drain drops on the narrow tunnel junction between the gates .",
    "this configuration gives us control over both the energy and the momentum of the tunneling electrons , as explained below .",
    "an additional gate lying between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( not shown in fig .  [ circuit ] ) allows us to deplete the 2deg in the center of the source , thus reducing the screening of the interactions in the wires by the 2deg .",
    "the energy of the electrons tunneling between the wires is given by @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the electron charge .",
    "the tunneling process occurs along the whole length @xmath23 of the tunnel junction .",
    "therefore , momentum is conserved to within an uncertainty of order @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a typical fermi wave vector in the wires .",
    "we can shift the momentum of the tunneling electrons with a magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) perpendicular to the plane defined by the wires .",
    "the value of the shift is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the center - to - center distance between the wires .",
    "in the experiment we measure the nonlinear differential tunneling conductance @xmath1  through a junction between two parallel wires .",
    "the sample we report here contains four top gates allowing us to vary the length of the junction @xmath23 by choosing different combinations of gates .",
    "we have studied in detail junctions with @xmath28  @xmath6 as well as symmetric junctions ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the results presented here are from junctions with @xmath30  @xmath6 .",
    "many of the effects that we measure rely on the smallness of @xmath31 , while others ( which we address here in detail ) are present only when @xmath23 is finite .      by mapping out @xmath1  we determine the dispersion curves of the wires.@xcite these are given by the curves that are traced by the main peaks as seen in fig .",
    "we can understand their gross features employing a noninteracting electron picture:@xcite the peaks result from tunneling between a fermi point in one wire and a mode in the other wire . since each occupied mode has two fermi points , two copies of the dispersion show up in the @xmath1  scan .",
    "all in all , for each pair of occupied modes in the two wires we expect to observe four dispersions , because there are four fermi points involved : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "( indices @xmath34 and @xmath35 label various modes in the wires , @xmath36 and @xmath37the upper and the lower wires . ) in reality , we observe only some of the transitions : for example , by carefully studying fig .",
    "[ gvb ] one can distinguish dispersions of three modes in the upper wire and five in the lower one , but only the following transitions seem to have a sizable signal : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , where the order in the list is of decreasing @xmath41 ( see below ) ; @xmath42 is the 2deg occupying the upper quantum well.@xcite such selection rules are related to the shape of the wave functions in the direction perpendicular to the cleaved edge . in identical wires , one would expect only the transitions @xmath43 to show up , due to the orthogonality between different modes . in dissimilar wires ,",
    "the selection rules are different and less strict so other transitions are observed .",
    "the dispersions allow us to extract the densities of electrons in each mode , @xmath44 , as follows .",
    "tunneling amongst each pair of occupied modes is enhanced near @xmath45 at two values of @xmath46 , where the two curves in @xmath1  cross . in",
    "the first ( in the following referred to as the lower crossing point ) , which occurs at @xmath47 , the direction in which the electrons propagate is conserved in the tunneling process . in the second ( referred to as the upper crossing point ) , the lorentz force exerted by @xmath41 exactly compensates for the momentum mismatch between oppositely moving electrons and the direction of propagation of the tunneling electrons reverses . in wires with vanishing cross section",
    ", these crossing points occur at @xmath48 in principle eq .",
    "( [ b12 ] ) can be used to extract the densities of the modes , regardless of electron - electron interactions in the wires@xcite or mesoscopic charging@xcite that can merely smear them at a finite voltage bias . in realistic wires that have a finite cross section , finding the densities",
    "is hampered by the weak magnetic field dependence that they acquire .",
    "this difficulty is overcome by a simple fitting procedure that we have developed : we assume that all the modes in a wire have the same field dependence , a reasonable assumption for our tight - confining potential in the growth direction of the quantum wells .",
    "we then guess the @xmath49 occupations of the modes in each wire , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and calculate their field dependences .",
    "if the resulting dispersions do not cross at @xmath52 , we adjust @xmath50 and @xmath51 and repeat the procedure .",
    "this is done iteratively for all the crossing points that we see , because changing the occupation of one mode affects the field dependence of all the other occupations in a wire .",
    "the dispersion that we use is that of noninteracting electrons in a finite quantum well , in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "such a dispersion depends only on the width and depth of the well and on the band mass of electrons in gaas .    in every case",
    "we have studied , we see clear deviations of the measured dispersions from the calculated noninteracting ones at a finite bias . in particular , we find that the velocities of some excitations are enhanced relative to the fermi velocities @xmath53 .",
    "the former are given by @xmath54 ( along the observed main peaks ) , while the latter can be obtained by the calculated slope of the ( noninteracting ) dispersions at the fermi points .",
    "this velocity enhancement is thought to correspond to the charge - density modes and can be accounted for by electron - electron interactions in the wires.@xcite    the ability to determine the dispersion relations relies on the high quality of the junctions to sustain momentum - conserving tunneling .",
    "momentum relaxation ensues as soon as invariance to translations is broken",
    ". the most obvious mechanism by which this happens is the finiteness of @xmath23 .",
    "we find that we indeed observe its effects .",
    "the second mechanism is the disorder inherent to all semiconductor devices , some effects of which seem to also be observed .",
    "the most spectacular manifestation of the breaking of translational invariance is the appearance of a regular pattern of oscillations away from the dispersion curves .",
    "[ osc24]a and [ osc26]a are typical examples of the patterns that we measure at low magnetic field . in this range of field ,",
    "the lines that correspond to the dispersion curves appear as the pronounced peaks that extend diagonally across the figures .",
    "in addition to these we observe numerous secondary peaks running parallel to the main dispersion curves .",
    "these side lobes always appear to the right of the wire dispersions , in the region that corresponds to momentum conserving tunneling for an upper wire with a reduced density . as a result",
    ", we see a checkerboard pattern of oscillations in region i , a hatched pattern in region ii , and no regular pattern in region iii ( see figs .  [ osc24]a and [ osc26]a for the definitions ) .",
    "the interference pattern also appears near the upper crossing point at high magnetic field .",
    "a typical example is shown in fig .",

    "the frequency of the oscillations depends on @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath23 is increased from 2  @xmath6 , fig .",

    "[ osc26 ] , the frequency in bias ( @xmath55 ) and in field ( @xmath56 ) increases by about a factor of three . the period is approximately related to the length of the junction through the formula @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the quantum of flux .",
    "a close examination of the low - field oscillations reveals an interesting behavior of their envelope .",
    "notable is the suppression of @xmath1  near @xmath45 which is independent of field . also visible",
    "are faint vertical gray stripes , where the amplitude of the oscillations in the @xmath3 direction is reduced .",
    "the modulation of the oscillation amplitude , as a function of @xmath2 , is shown in panels ( b ) of figures [ osc24 ] and [ osc26 ] .",
    "the oscillatory part of @xmath7 thus depends on @xmath2 on two major scales : the faster scale ( 0.5  mv for @xmath59  @xmath6 ) corresponds to the oscillations described by eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) .",
    "the slower scale ( 2  mv for @xmath59  @xmath6 ) governs the distance between the stripes of suppressed @xmath1  parallel to the field axis , including the zero - bias suppression . like the fast scale ,",
    "the slow scale is roughly inversely proportional to the lithographic length of the tunneling region .",
    "prominent in all scans that have high enough resolution in @xmath2 is a strong suppression of the conductance near @xmath45 at all magnetic fields .",
    "the width of this conductance dip is of order of 0.1  mv , see figs .",
