    "its up - type quark , the top , has not yet been observed , although we are getting more and more stringent limits on its mass from direct search and radiative correction analysis . on the other hand , the corresponding down - type quark , the @xmath1 ,",
    "is being studied with increasing accuracy . both growing statistics and the operation of dedicated vertex detector for @xmath1 tagging at high energy machines already allows a good determination of @xmath1 couplings .",
    "present data clearly point to the @xmath1 as the @xmath41/2 component of a weak left - handed isodoublet @xcite .",
    "at lep , one measures the @xmath1 neutral current couplings through the @xmath5 width and forward - backward asymmetry on the @xmath2  peak .",
    "in fact , one has ( z b|b ) ( v_b^2+a_b^2 ) a_fb^0(m_z ) = a_e a_b where a_f ( f = e , b ) and i neglected terms of the order @xmath6 @xcite .    in principle , another determination of the quantity @xmath7 ( or , equivalently , of the ratio @xmath8 ) can be derived from the measurement of the @xmath1-polarization asymmetry on the @xmath2  peak . according to the standard model ,",
    "@xmath1 quarks are produced almost completely longitudinally polarized at @xmath9 .",
    "the angular dependence of the polarization asymmetry is given by @xcite p_b ( ) = - [ angle ] where @xmath10 is the production cross section for a @xmath1 quark with right-(left-)handed longitudinal polarization and , as above , i neglected mass effects of the order @xmath11 . since @xmath12 is quite smaller than @xmath7 , eq.([angle ] )",
    "depends only weakly on the @xmath1 production angle @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding average mean polarization is [ pbc ] p_b =- a_b = - qcd corrections to @xmath14 have been computed in ref.@xcite .",
    "chirality - violating mass effects in the production cross section for polarized @xmath1 quarks at one - loop are found to decrease the tree - level polarization  @xmath15  by less than @xmath16 .",
    "in analogy to the @xmath17 polarization measurement at lep , measuring @xmath14 would provide an alternative method to determine @xmath7 that has the advantage , with respect to the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath18 , not to be suppressed by the small quantity @xmath12 (  eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , as anticipated , @xmath14 is quite large in the standard model .",
    "one has ( assuming @xmath19 ) p_b=-0.936 [ pb ] to be confronted with the @xmath17 polarization value @xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately , contrary to the @xmath17 polarization asymmetries that have already provided a nice determination of @xmath21 and @xmath12 at lep @xcite , a measurement of @xmath14 is not as much straightforward .",
    "this is mainly due to hadronization and fragmentation properties of @xmath1 quarks that largely dilute and obscure @xmath1 polarization effects in the observed final states .",
    "moreover , there are rather large theoretical uncertainties in the predictions of such strong interaction effects , that make the disentangling of the polarization @xmath14 a quite difficult task .    in this paper , i will review the present status of theoretical understanding about the possibility of detecting some effect of such a large value of @xmath14 in @xmath1 hadron final states on the @xmath2  peak .",

    "for instance , one has an error on @xmath48 of only about @xmath49 by varying @xmath46 in the range @xmath50 mev@xmath51 mev .    at this point ,",
    "the observed leptonic spectrum in the laboratory is obtained , in the collinear approximation , by convoluting @xmath52 with the polarization - dependent `` nave '' leptonic spectrum in eq .",

    "hence , one can now compute the ratios @xmath53 of the @xmath54-th moments of the leptonic spectrum at @xmath55 over the ones at petra energies versus the `` effective '' @xmath1 longitudinal polarization @xmath56 , defined as the fraction of @xmath14 that survives hadronization processes at lep . in fact , @xmath53 is given by @xmath45 times the polarization - dependent ratio of the moments , @xmath57 , of the `` nave '' lepton spectra at lep and petra [ rl ] r_^n()&=&= + & = & r_b^n .",
    "one important point is that , at petra energies , @xmath1 quarks are produced , to a very good approximation , through @xmath58 exchange alone , that is with zero longitudinal polarization .",
    "thus the low - energy data offer a way to calibrate on unpolarized @xmath1 hadron samples .    in fig .  2 ,",
    "the value predicted for @xmath53 with @xmath59 ( mean - value ratio ) , is shown as a function of the `` effective '' @xmath1 polarization @xmath56 .",
    "the band corresponds to @xmath46 varying between 150  gev ( upper curves ) and 350  gev ( lower curves ) in @xmath45 .",
    "a change @xmath60 in the polarization from the unpolarized case ( @xmath61 ) corresponds to a @xmath62 variation in @xmath63 .",
    "the study of higher order moments is expecially useful for consistency checks on the measured value of @xmath56 (  ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the sensitivity to the exact value of @xmath64 is in general reduced in the ratio , with respect to the original moments .    in fig .  2 ,",
    "a comparison with available experimental data @xcite is also shown .",
    "the dashed area corresponds to the measured value @xmath65 , that has been determined assuming @xmath66 in the lep data . with this assumption , one gets @xmath67  ( neglecting @xmath68 effects in the convolution of @xmath52 with the nave leptonic spectrum ) and , as a consequence , @xmath69 .",
    "experimental data are already accurate enough to exclude large polarization effects and point to a value of the `` effective '' @xmath1 polarization centred around 0 and compatible with the theoretical prediction of about @xmath70 .",
    "higher statistics on @xmath1 events at lep will soon allow to study polarization effects in a purely @xmath71 sample , that is foreseen to retain most of the initial @xmath1-quark polarization ,  an order of magnitude larger than in the previous inclusive analysis . in refs.@xcite and @xcite ,",
    "some studies of exclusive decays of polarized @xmath71 are presented .",
    "of course , the ambiguities in the knowledge of the @xmath1-quark fragmentation also apply to polarization measurements based on semileptonic @xmath1-baryon decays .",
    "a relevant question is whether , with a reasonable statistics on semileptonic @xmath71 decays ( some data are already available @xcite ) , lep data will no longer need to be normalized with lower - energy data .",
    "one could study the ratios @xmath72 of the lepton moments for the @xmath71 sample over those for the @xmath73-meson sample , both measured at lep . in this case , one gets [ rl2 ] r_^n()__b&= & = + & = & .",
    "hence , only moments of the nave charged - lepton spectra are left in the ratio and @xmath1-fragmentation effects are mostly cancelled .",
    "the main problem with this method is that one should actually calibrate on the spectrum from unpolarized @xmath71 s ( and not @xmath73 s ) .",
    "without such a normalization , a possible observed difference between the @xmath71 and the inclusive spectra could be blamed on the model dependent features of the exclusive @xmath71 decay .",
    "the order of magnitude of these effects have been studied in ref.@xcite and found to be comparable to polarization effects (  fig .",
    "3 ) . hence",
    ", a reliable model for @xmath71 semileptonic decays is needed before polarization effects can really be established in this way .",
    "recently , a very interesting and effective method to get rid of fragmentation effects in the @xmath71 semileptonic sample was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "a new variable y= given by the ratio of the mean electron and neutrino laboratory energies in the inclusive semileptonic @xmath71 decay , has been introduced .",
    "this variable depends mainly on the @xmath1 rest - frame lepton angular distributions , while the dependence on the @xmath1 boost in the laboratory ( and , hence , on @xmath1 fragmentation effects ) drops out .",
    "indeed , since at lep @xmath74 , the mean lepton energy in the laboratory is given by e = e + p ( e + p ) where @xmath75 is the longitudinal momentum in the @xmath1 direction of flight , @xmath76 , and primed quantities refer to the @xmath1 rest - frame . as a consequence , one",
    "has y = the average energies and longitudinal momenta in the @xmath1 rest - frame can be easily computed by means of eqs.([cm ] ) and ( [ cmnu ] ) .",
    "one finds @xcite e_&=&(--6_c^2 + 10_c^3 -+-9_c^2_c -3_c^3_c ) + p_&=&- p",
    "( --4_c^2 + 4_c^3 + --3_c^2_c -3_c^3_c ) + e_&=&(-3_c-2_c^2 + 6_c^3 -+-6_c^2_c ) + p_&=&- p ( -+_c+-2_c^3 + -+2_c^2_c )    while the average energies are independent of polarization , the average longitudinal momenta differ from 0 only for a polarized quark .    in fig .  4 ,",
    "@xmath77 is plotted versus @xmath78 .",
    "besides being free of fragmentation ambiguities , @xmath77 has the advantage to be much more sensitive than @xmath79 to the @xmath1 polarization ( , for @xmath80 , @xmath77 goes from 7/6 at @xmath66 up to 2 at @xmath81 ) .",
    "this is due to the opposite behaviour of @xmath82 with respect to @xmath83 when varying @xmath78 , as well as to the larger sensitivity to @xmath78 of neutrino spectra (  table i ) .",
    "also , the @xmath77 sensitivity to @xmath84 is rather mild .",
    "of course , neutrino spectra can be measured with less accuracy than electron and muon spectra .",
    "indeed , a missing energy has to be determined in each event , whose experimental error ( @xmath85gev ) is limited essentially by the resolution on the accompanying hadronic jets @xcite .",
    "this reflects in a @xmath77 resolution estimated as _",
    "y ~ ( with @xmath54 number of measured events ) corresponding to an error of about @xmath86 on @xmath77 with present statistics .",
    "this implies an accuracy of about @xmath86 on @xmath78 (  fig .  4 ) .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "also other variables are considered , that have the advantage to eliminate most of systematic errors .",
    "these are the ratio @xmath87 and difference @xmath88 of the @xmath77 s corresponding to the baryon and meson samples r_y & & = 1-k_r p + d_y&&y_baryon - y_meson = -k_d p + where , for @xmath89 , one can predict k_r=0.660.02 k_d=0.750.03 neither qcd corrections nor the adopted kinematical approximations do contribute to @xmath90 and @xmath91 more than 0.02 . hence , any measured deviation of @xmath87 and @xmath88 from 1 and 0 respectively will give a polarization measurement with very good efficiency .",
    "in this paper , i have reviewed different strategies for detecting @xmath1 polarization effects through lepton energy spectra in the inclusive semileptonic decays of @xmath1 hadrons .",
    "i have shown that , if one concentrate on electron and muon spectra in the inclusive @xmath1 hadrons decay , one has to deal with large theoretical uncertainties coming from the only - partial knowledge of the @xmath1 fragmentation function . a strategy to control these ambiguities that makes use of both lep and lower - energy petra data has been outlined . by comparing theoretical predictions with experimental data , one can already exclude large polarization effects in the lep inclusive leptonic spectrum .",
    "much more can be done with large statistics on the @xmath1 baryon sample , by restricting the polarization study to @xmath1 baryons .",
    "in fact , the corresponding @xmath78 effect should be about an order of magnitude larger than in the inclusive hadronic spectrum , since ( contrary to @xmath1 baryons ) @xmath1 meson , which make up most of the hadronic sample , are expected not to retain any original spin information . in principle , when restricting to @xmath71 samples , a realistic modelling of exclusive decays is required .",
    "it has been shown that , if one can study also neutrino spectra with good accuracy , the new variable @xmath92 is almost free of theoretical uncertainties and optimizes the sensitivity to @xmath78 , due also to the very good sensitivity of neutrino spectra .                                                              * figure captions * +   + a ) charged - lepton energy spectrum in the laboratory frame for a nave @xmath1 polarization @xmath14 ( solid lines ) compared to the unpolarized case @xmath66 ( dashed lines ) , assuming different values for @xmath84 .",
