    "a black hole , in quantum sense , is not completely black , which can radiate energies continuously .",
    "furthermore , like the black body radiation , it has a temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the surface gravity of the black hole @xcite .",
    "however , for the thermal radiation spectrum @xcite , the so called  information loss paradox \" arises , i.e. , if the radiation is thermal , there are no correlations between the emitted field quanta , and then one will lose information about the nature of the matter that originally formed the black hole .",
    "more technically , the complete evaporation of a black hole , whereby a pure quantum state evolves into a thermal state , would violate the quantum mechanical unitarity . in this regard , it is worthy to note that many groups @xcite have attempted addressing this puzzle , but none has been successful . recently , parikh and wilczek @xcite pointed out that hawking radiation is completely non - thermal if one enforces the energy conservation law .",
    "based on this idea , zhang and cai et al .",
    "@xcite proved that for the non - thermal spectrum there are correlations between the radiations , and thus a queue of corrected radiations can transmit encoded information . according to careful calculations of entropy taken out by the emitted particles",
    ", they found that the black hole as tunneling is an entropy conservation process .",
    "thus , they concluded that the black hole evaporation process is unitary .",
    "after their work , a lot of papers @xcite extended this method to other backgrounds , such as quantum corrected black hole @xcite and non - commutated black hole @xcite .",
    "of great interest , all the reexaminations arrived at the same conclusion that information leaks out through the radiation , and the total entropy is conserved .",
    "so , their method may provide a possibility to solve the  information loss paradox \" .",
    "therefore , it is worthy to check whether the radiation spectrum is non - thermal or not .    on the other hand , based on the hamilton - jacobi method beyond semiclassical approximation , r. banerjee and b. r. majhi @xcite computed all quantum corrections in the single particle action revealing that these are proportional to the usual semiclassical contribution .",
    "they gave a quantum modified hawking temperature and entropy .",
    "after their work , many papers appeared to discuss the quantum corrections to temperature and entropy for different backgrounds @xcite . especially , for this quantum corrected case , d. singleton et al .",
    "@xcite used the same method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the  information loss paradox \" , and they also found that the total information will be carried away by the correlations of the outgoing radiations when the black hole evaporates completely .",
    "however , some authors @xcite argued that there are no quantum corrections to the hawking temperature and entropy if one chooses the standard definition of the particle energy . and",
    "all the corrections are found to be the contributions to the particle energy .",
    "this choice is reasonable because it keeps the validity of the first law of the thermodynamics .",
    "thus , a dispute , whether the hawking temperature and entropy are modified or not , is caused .",
    "it is worthy to note that zhang et al .",
    "have compared the non - corrected thermal and non - thermal spectra , and they found the thermal spectrum can be distinguished with the non - thermal spectrum from their distinctly different energy covariances @xcite .",

    "so , it is needed to consider all possible radiation spectra , and give a complete analysis . in this paper , we focus our attentions on these puzzles of hawking radiation introduced above , and try to find out whether the radiation spectrum is thermal or non - thermal with or without high order quantum corrections .",

    "we investigate the long - standing  information loss paradox \" and the features of the non - corrected thermal ( non - thermal ) spectrum and the temperature - corrected ( energy - corrected ) thermal ( non - thermal ) spectrum .",
    "our analysis show that the largest covariances of successive emissions appear near the planck mass scale , i.e. , for the temperature - corrected non - thermal spectrum @xmath121 for @xmath122 , and for the energy - corrected non - thermal spectrum @xmath123 for @xmath124   dimensional schwarzschild black hole , the fundamental planck scale is reduced depending on the compact space of volume @xmath125 , e.g. , the reduced planck scale @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 @xcite ] .",
    "here we give an open problem that the possibility of different radiation spectra discussed above may also exist for other black hole systems , such as the micro black holes model discussed extensively in connection with the experiments of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . according to research @xcite ,",
    "it is estimated that the minimum black hole mass should be in the range of @xmath129 for @xmath130 collisions at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath131 at lhc .",
    "based on it , a more recent study @xcite showed that the limits on the minimum semiclassical black hole and string - ball masses in the range @xmath132 to @xmath133 for a wide range of model parameters .",
    "so , if the radiation of a micro black hole were observed , then it may be possible to use the energy covariances as a indicator to determine whether the emission spectrum is non - thermal or not , and whether the emission spectrum is temperature - corrected or not .",
    "also note that the energy scale about the production and observation of micro black holes is being debated @xcite .",
    "thus , when and whether the micro black holes could be observed on earth , especially in a lhc experiment , needs a lot of work .",
    "on the other hand , other kinds of manmade black holes , such as those implemented or discussed with optical , acoustic , and cold - atomic systems @xcite , are being discussed , and several experiments @xcite had shown evidence of hawking radiation from the event horizon",
    ". therefore , the same problems we discussed above are also worthy of being studied in these real radiation systems .",
    "we have discussed several radiation spectra of schwarzschild black hole , the non - corrected thermal ( non - thermal ) spectrum , the temperature - corrected thermal ( non - thermal ) spectrum , and the energy - corrected thermal ( non - thermal ) spectrum .",
    "we emphasize that the non - thermal property of radiation spectra comes from taking account of the energy conservation during the evaporation process , and the quantum corrections results from the hamilton - jacobi method beyond semiclassical approximation .",
    "furthermore , we use the temperature - corrected non - thermal spectrum and the energy - corrected one to solve the long - standing  information loss paradox \" of black hole .",
    "we find that the entropy of the emitted particles , which exhaust the initial black hole , is identical to the original entropy of the black hole , thus entropy is conserved between the initial ( black hole plus no radiation ) and final ( no black hole plus radiation field quanta ) states . which reveals that no information is lost , and the black hole evaporation process in unitary .",
    "these discussions , therefore , may provide a possible way to understand the  information loss paradox \" .    to distinguish different radiation spectra , their corresponding average emission energies ,",
    "average numbers of emissions and average emission energy fluctuations are compared .",
    "it is found that there are no obvious differences between them except for near the planck mass scale .",
    "especially , the energy - corrected spectra have the same corresponding average emission energies , average numbers of emissions and average emission energy fluctuations with that for the non - corrected spectra . of great interest , we find that for all the thermal spectra the energy covariances of hawking radiations completely vanish , while they are nontrivial for all the non - thermal spectra .",
    "especially , the temperature - corrected non - thermal spectrum and the energy - corrected one have distinctly different maximums of energy covariances . as a result of that , these differences provide a way towards experimentally studying the long - standing puzzles of hawking radiation that whether the radiation spectrum of black hole is thermal or non - thermal with or without high order quantum corrections .",
