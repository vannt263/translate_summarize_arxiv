    "it is possible , using finite temperature field theory , to calculate the energy and mean field due to the excited quasiparticles in a self consistent manner for static configurations @xcite . to study the time evolution of thermally - excited condensates using such techniques does however , require a prohibitive amount of computational time even for a one - dimensional system .",
    "the result is that there is no computationally simple way to study the evolution of thermally - excited states or self - consistent combinations of them that employs the fuller quantum field theory approach .",

    "to overcome the prohibitive amount of computational time required to time evolve a thermally - excited condensate using finite temperature field theory , an alternative technique has been devised .",
    "this technique for generating a self - consistent thermally - excited state involves taking a noninteracting mean field and propagating it using the gp equation ( eq .  ( [ equ : gp ] ) ) , whilst the interactions are slowly switched on .",
    "one should expect the gp equation to describe the kinetics and dynamics of a finite temperature boson gas as long as the relevant modes of excitation are sufficiently well populated .",
    "indeed , moore and turok@xcite have shown that one can use the evolution of the classical field during the electroweak phase transition to determine the dynamics of the infrared modes of the quantum field .",
    "the classical field description neglects quantum fluctuations ( and other quantum manifestations , such as squeezed states or spontaneous emission ) .",
    "the method works if , and only if , the population of the normal modes of the system are much greater than unity . the normal modes of the system can then be treated as classical objects or quasiparticles that are statistically independent of the energy levels , allowing them to be represented by a classical field .",
    "morgan et .",
    "@xcite have also stressed that the use of a classical field to describe a finite temperature bec is valid in the limit of large mode occupations .",
    "the gp equation includes the dynamics and kinetics of a boson gas through the nonlinear term in the hamiltonian , which in effect represents all the stimulated two - body scattering processes . these processes",
    "ensure that an initial distribution will , given sufficient time , result in a thermal distribution of the quasiparticles , irrespective of the quantitative nature of the initial population distribution .",
    "the resulting population distribution is close to the full bose - einstein distribution in the equipartition sense , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath32 is the temperature and @xmath33 is the mode energy . in this sense",
    "the quasiparticles act as classical objects , macroscopically populating the normal modes of the system .",
    "if the gp equation provides an accurate description of the quasiparticle interactions , and therefore the time dependence of the boson gas , it must also describe its transition to equilibrium .",
    "for example , a boson gas could be prepared with a non - thermal distribution of the energy level populations . given enough time however , the collisional interactions within the gas would rethermalise it , recreating a bose - einstein population distribution , in the equipartition sense .",
    "kagan et .",
    "al.@xcite argue that , for large quasiparticle populations , this is true even when the initial distribution is far from equilibrium or where the ground state is initially unpopulated .",
    "this issue has however , been the subject of considerable debate @xcite .    to ensure that the resulting ensemble is fully representative and that the subsequent ` nonlinear mixing ' is unbiased",
    ", the initial distribution must include all symmetry combinations .",
    "this requirement can be deduced from an explicit consideration of the parity invariance of the evolution of the sho mode amplitudes .",
    "the consequent symmetry dependent nonlinear mixing implies that if one symmetry combination is omitted the resulting nonlinear mixing will be unbalanced .",
    "in particular , if the ensemble is comprised of entirely even or odd modes , resulting in a totally even nonlinear operator , the modes only couple between like symmetries producing a purely even or odd distribution .",
    "the thermalisation or nonlinear mixing of the mode populations described by the nonlinear term in the hamiltonian of th gp equation is the underlining process of this method of self - consistent thermally - excited state generation .",
    "it allows a direct solution of the finite temperature analysis to be circumvented when the quasiparticle populations are much greater than unity .",
    "the self - consistent thermally - excited state generation is computationally achieved by taking a noninteracting , non - equilibrium , thermally - excited distribution and adiabatically increasing the nonlinear term .",
    "adiabatically switching on the interactions results in the relaxation of the mean field into an interacting , equilibrium distribution .    to this",
    "end the initial state is a thermally distributed superposition of sho modes and therefore , a thermally - excited solution to the @xmath34 gp equation .",
    "the initial state , @xmath35 , is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the mode - cut - off numbers , @xmath38 is the modulus of the mode amplitude and @xmath39 is the mode phase .",
    "the sho modes , @xmath40 , in cartesian coordinates are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the hermite polynomials .",
    "since the initial superposition has a finite temperature , the initial mode probabilities are given by the linear , @xmath43 , bose - einstein distribution namely @xmath44 .",
    "the noninteracting thermal state has no long range order , this incoherence enables the mode phases of the initial state , @xmath39 , to be described by a random variable on the interval @xmath45 .",
    "the numerical simulation must then be run several times using different initial states to ensure that the kinetics are independent of the initial phases .",
    "the sho modes in the initial superposition are thermally distributed , however because of the mode cut - off numbers , @xmath37 , the initial mean field is a truncation of a thermally - excited state and therefore , not in equilibrium .",
    "the resulting truncation error , however , is negligible as the choice of initial parameters , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , ensures that the initial distribution is sufficiently accurate , whilst still being computationally manageable .",
    "furthermore the nonlinear counterparts of the unpopulated sho states , @xmath48 @xmath49 , should not be unfavourably populated as all symmetry combinations initially exist .",
    "therefore the thermalisation process will couple all the states populating them irrespectively of the initial mode amplitude .",

    "the increase in the nonlinearity from zero , where the initial condition is an exact solution to the gp equation , to its final value corresponds to filling the trap with like particles , increasing the number of atoms in the thermally - excited state .    to obtain a link between the number of atoms in the thermally - excited state and its zero temperature counterpart the final value of @xmath52",

    "combining this number of atoms with a trap ratio @xmath57 ensures that the nonlinear factor , @xmath52 , is large enough to result in a nonlinear mixing rate that allows full thermalisation of the bose - condensed gas .",
    "the large numbers involved simply reflect the slow pace of the nonlinear mixing in two dimensions due to the reduced mode density .",

    "with the ability to create thermally - excited states , a model of the evaporative cooling process can now be investigated .",
    "the process of evaporative cooling involves the selective removal of the most energetic atoms in the thermally - excited state followed by a period of rethermalisation resulting in a net cooling effect . in current experiments the cooling",
    "is carried out by inducing a radio frequency transition to an untrapped magnetic sublevel .",
    "the transition frequency is a function of the magnetic field and this dependence results in the selective removal from the trap of atoms with a potential energy @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the angular frequency of the transition inducing laser .",
    "the frequency of the radiation is then gradually lowered bringing less energetic atoms into resonance with the untrapped state with the thermally - excited state rethermalising as the evaporative process continues .",
    "this energy dependent removal of the atoms makes it possible to view the evaporative cooling either as an absorption of the edges of the condensate , or the lowering of the trap walls , allowing the escape of the more energetic atoms .",
    "of the two options , it is computationally simpler to introduce an absorbing boundary , the position of which is a function of time .",
    "such a model does not make any assumption or approximation other than representing the state by a classical field or that the cooling can be modelled by a spatially dependent removal of the field .",
    "inclusion of the absorption term , @xmath73 , in the gp equation results in the time dependent nonlinear schroedinger equation @xmath74    since the absorbing boundary must have a smooth profile to preclude the introduction of computational errors , @xmath73 was modelled using a super - gaussian @xmath75 here @xmath76 defines the position of the step function and @xmath77 determines the effectiveness of the cooling which is related to the magnitude of the field of the evaporative cooling laser .",

    "the evaporation length , @xmath82 , implicitly determines the energy of the hotter atoms that are being removed from the thermally - excited state and as it is a function of time it also determines the dynamics of the cooling and ultimately the resultant ground state .",
    "the cooling rate depends on the collision rate and therefore the density of atoms in the thermally - excited state and it is most effective , in terms of the resultant condensate population , if the absorbing boundary moves slowly removing only the minimum number of atoms . to this end , two cooling strategies are compared , namely    [ equ : ablen ] @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the initial evaporation length ; @xmath85 is the final evaporation length ; @xmath86 is the time scale over which the cooling takes place and @xmath87 .",

    "the number of computational steps and transverse grid size is the same as in section [ sec : exs ] with the cooling time , @xmath91 , which results in a computation taking the same real time to complete as before .",

    "striking differences in the results of the evaporative cooling occur depending on the choice of @xmath93 , two specific cases are considered below .",
    "the results also show , however , that there is little variation between the exponential and linear dependence of the evaporation length , eqs .",
    "( [ equ : ablen ] ) . although the linear dependence , eq .",
    "( [ equ : ablena ] ) , results in a slightly larger ground state population and a slightly warmer condensate than the exponential dependence .",
    "subsequent figures presented in this paper relate to this linear case .      in this case",
    "the evaporation length varies monotonically from @xmath95 to @xmath96 during the cooling cycle followed by 20 scaled time units of equilibration resulting in @xmath91 .",
    "the change is slow enough to ensure that only the most energetic atoms are removed from the thermally - excited state .",

    "[ fig : five ] , is now much smoother and has large coherent areas .",

    "the figure also shows that the atoms from the more energetic states have not just been removed , but that the population has been a transfered to the ground state as a result of the rethermalisation process .      in this case",
    "the evaporation length varies monotonically from @xmath103 to @xmath104 during the cooling cycle , giving an initially larger spatial cut into the thermally - excited state .",
    "this is then followed by 20 scaled time units of equilibration resulting in @xmath91 .",
    "the initially larger spatial cut results in the removal of some atoms which may have a significant amount of kinetic energy . cooling in this fashion typically results in a mean field density , shown in fig .",

    "therefore , when the cooling is carried out as described in section [ sec : cool1 ] the vortex pairs annihilate one another exactly . if , however , @xmath93 is less than the size of the thermally - excited state , the initially deeper spatial cut into the thermally - excited state removes a vortex during the initial stages of the cooling cycle resulting in an unbalanced vortex population",
    ". consequently , as the thermally - excited state is cooled , at least one vortex will remain trapped with the ground state , resulting in a state with a non zero angular momentum .",
    "the resulting trapped vortex state is robust and remains with the condensate until the spatial confinement , due to the evaporative cooling , causes the state to be energetically unfavourable at which point it disappears .",
    "this method of vortex trapping may be directly applicable to two - dimensional experimental situations if the evaporation surface in the experiment can be setup so that it removes atoms with a proportion of kinetic energy in the initial stages of cooling .",
    "we have shown in this paper that using the gp equation to time evolve an initial state is a numerically efficient method for the creation of self consistent thermally - excited states .",
    "results presented demonstrate that the gp equation acts to thermalise an initially non - equilibrium state through two body scattering processes described by the nonlinearity within it .",
    "the resulting nonlinear mixing generates a self - consistent thermally - excited state with an interacting bose - einstein population distribution , in the equipartition sense . where the ensemble average of the gp equation describes the finite temperature kinetics and dynamics of a boson gas if and only if the quasiparticle populations @xmath105 .",
    "a model of the evaporative cooling process without the assumption of sufficient ergodicity or approximations relating to the strength of the interactions between the thermal and condensate parts of the thermally - excited state was presented .",
    "this model uses an extension of the gp equation based on the removal of the most energetic atoms in the spatial distribution .",
    "results from a two - dimensional numerical simulation show that the evaporative cooling model produces a visibly cooler mean field density and a population transfer to the ground state , which gives rise to a coherent condensate .",
    "these results demonstrate that the model accurately reflects the evaporative cooling process and consequent rethermalisation of the thermally - excited state .",
    "furthermore other results presented show that under a different cooling regime vortex states can be trapped along with the condensate and it is noted that it may be possible to achieve this using current experimental configurations .    the possibility of creating self - consistent thermally - excited states and the numerical simulation of these states in two dimensions allows the study of many new and interesting phenomenon such as vortex and other quasiparticle interactions , coherence properties of thermally - excited states and more accurate models of bose - condensation experiments .",

    "<S> a straight forward numerical technique , based on the gross - pitaevskii equation , is used to generate a self - consistent description of thermally - excited states of a dilute boson gas . the process of evaporative cooling is then modelled by following the time evolution of the system using the same equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the subsequent rethermalisation of the thermally - excited state produces a cooler coherent condensate . </S>",
    "<S> other results presented show that trapping vortex states with the ground state may be possible in a two - dimensional experimental environment .    2 </S>"
