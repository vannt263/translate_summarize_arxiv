    "the concept of flow - driven cloud formation @xcite can explain two observational constraints on how molecular clouds form stars , derived from local star - forming regions : first , all local molecular clouds are observed to be forming stars , and second , the stellar age spreads are on the order of @xmath0  myr , several times shorter than cloud crossing times .",
    "the first constraint suggests that star formation sets in immediately ( or even during ) molecular cloud formation , and that the second constraint is trivially fulfilled in a scenario where the clouds themselves form in large - scale  converging \" flows .",
    "the immediate (  rapid \" ) onset of star formation in the forming clouds and the fact that the star formation efficiency is only a few percent @xcite mandates that the clouds are highly structured : local collapse must set in before global collapse can overwhelm the dynamics .",
    "the notion of cloud formation in converging flows has led to a series of numerical experiments investigating the physical processes relevant for the rapid fragmentation and for the control of the star formation efficiency .",
    "there is agreement across the models ( despite different initial and boundary conditions ) on the following results : ( 1 ) rapid fragmentation is induced by strong radiative losses during the flow collision ( possibly even by thermal instability if the clouds form from atomic gas ) , and by dynamical instabilities @xcite ( 2 ) turbulence in molecular clouds is a natural result of the dynamical instabilities during the cloud formation , and is driven by global gravitational collapse at later stages of the cloud evolution @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) strong , non - linear density contrasts can also be driven by self - gravity in finite clouds , due to geometry ( or  edge \" ) effects @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) although the rapid fragmentation can keep the star formation efficiency low , eventually , feedback or cloud dispersal is needed to prevent a large percentage of the gas to participate in gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "the most obvious difference in the simulation results is the morphology of the forming clouds .",
    "all models use some mechanism to break the symmetry in the colliding flows  otherwise , the flow collision would result in a plane - parallel shock .",
    "models with small - scale perturbations (  noise \" ) in the velocities tend to lead to extremely flattened clouds with a strong ring due to the gravitational edge effect @xcite in finite , sheet - like clouds . if the velocity perturbations are imposed on larger scales ( e.g as a turbulent power spectrum ) , or if the collision interface between the two flows is perturbed , turbulent structures form that are not necessarily coherent when viewed from different directions @xcite .",
    "to understand better the effect of initial conditions on the clouds forming in the flow collisions , we present a simple experiment , comparing two ( otherwise identical ) cloud formation simulations , one with a smooth inflow , and one with a clumpy inflow of identical mass .",
    "the experiment is also motivated by the analysis of @xcite , suggesting that cloud formation out of warm atomic gas would require time and length scales too large to be feasible ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this problem is solved by the realization that the flow collision is three - dimensional , allowing gravitational collapse and accretion along the dimensions perpendicular to the flows , and thus circumventing the one - dimensional limit on column density accumulation @xcite . yet , @xcite suggest that clumpy flows could reduce the accumulation and molecule formation time scale ( especially if the clumps are already molecular ) . here , we will test , what effects a clumpy flow has on the resulting cloud and star formation process .",
    "to model a finite molecular cloud forming in a collision of two flows , we use the adaptive - mesh - refinement code astrobear 2.0 to solve the equations of hydrodynamics including self - gravity and equilibrium cooling . for a detailed discussion of astrobear ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "poisson s equation is solved with hypre @xcite .",
    "we used a non - split ctu integrator following @xcite , and the sink particle implementation discussed by @xcite .",
    "we performed two simulations of @xmath1  pc diameter flows with a mean density @xmath2  @xmath3 , colliding head - on at @xmath4 km  s@xmath5 for a period of 30  myr .",
    "the flows collide in the y - z plane within a box that is @xmath6  pc@xmath7 in size .",
    "we use a base grid of @xmath8 cells with @xmath9 additional levels of refinement for an effective resolution of @xmath10 and a physical cell size of @xmath11  pc .",

    "this curve can be seen in the dashed line of figure [ pdfs ] .",
    "note the dashed line only extends to densities of @xmath21  @xmath3 to avoid confusion at higher densities - but the equilibrium curve can be seen at higher densities in the distribution itself because the thermal timescales are much smaller than any other time scale at those densities , and thus the gas lines up with the equilibrium curve . in the  smooth \" simulation , the inflowing gas has a uniform density of @xmath22  @xmath3 and a thermal equilibrium pressure of @xmath23  k  @xmath3 .",
    "for the  clumpy \" simulation , the mean inflow density is also @xmath22  @xmath3 , yet the flow contains many small clumps of radius @xmath24  pc and a density of @xmath25  @xmath3 , placed randomly in a smooth lower background density of @xmath26  @xmath3 .",
    "both the clumps and the low density background are in pressure equilibrium at @xmath27  k  @xmath3 and both are stable to thermal instabilities , though they are not in thermal equilibrium with each other .",
    "the high density contrast @xmath28 between clumps and background results in a filling fraction of @xmath29 .",
    "the clump radius was chosen to be much less than the jeans length at the clump density and pressure ( @xmath30  pc ) so that the clumps would be stable against gravitational collapse . in both runs ,",
    "the interface between oppositely directed material is initially rippled with a random sequence of sines and cosines of amplitude @xmath31  pc , wavelengths from 40 pc down to @xmath32  pc and power proportional to @xmath33 .    , and @xmath34  myr .",
    "the dot - dashed line indicates the ram pressure of the flows , and the diagonal line in the upper left plot shows @xmath35",
    "all of the following analysis focuses on a hockey - puck shaped region that is @xmath1  pc in diameter and @xmath18  pc thick , centered on the interface between the two flows .",
    "this region is outlined in figures  [ smoothpanels ] and [ clumpypanels ] .",
    "figure  [ pdfs ] shows the joint probability distribution in logarithmic density - pressure space for both runs at times @xmath36 , and @xmath34 myr .",
    "in the smooth model ( left column ) , material enters the collision region on the equilibrium curve at @xmath22  @xmath3 which coincides with the peak in the equilibrium cooling curve .",
    "as the material collides with the oppositely directed material it is initially compressed adiabatically up to the flow ram pressure at @xmath37  @xmath3 .",
    "it then cools and compresses onto the thermal equilibrium curve . with time , more material piles up at higher densities .",
    "eventually , self - gravity takes over at the highest densities and compresses this material further , above the ram pressure provided by the flow .",
    "at this point , gas collapses and forms a core , or is being accreted by an existing core .",
    "the core formation or accretion explains the lack of material at densities above @xmath38  @xmath3 .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the clumpy flow on the other hand ( right column ) has material entering the collision region at both @xmath26  @xmath3 and @xmath25  @xmath3 .",
    "additionally , some mixing occurs between the clumps and the background flow which causes the thick band of material below the thermal equilibrium curve . at these densities ,",
    "the thermal time scales are longer than the dynamical time [ see fig .  3 of @xcite ] -",
    "so this material does not equilibrate before colliding with the oppositely directed flow .",
    "the low density background appears to also compress adiabatically though not to as high pressures as the smooth run . at the interface between the two flows",
    "there are three possible types of interactions due to the two densities present in the flow : ( a ) for background - background collisions , the ram pressure will be @xmath39th of that for the smooth flow .",
    "( b ) collisions between background material from one side and clumps from the other will produce bow shocks equivalent to background material running over a stationary clump with velocity @xmath40  km  s@xmath5 , resulting in a ram pressure equal to that in the smooth model , at @xmath37  k  @xmath3 .",
    "( c ) finally , head - on clump - clump collisions , though rare , can produce pressures @xmath25 times the ram pressure in the smooth model . yet",
    "this material will cool fairly quickly due to the high densities .",
    "figures [ smoothpanels ] and [ clumpypanels ] show column densities taken along the flow axis ( left ) and normal to the flow axis ( right ) for the smooth and clumpy runs respectively . also shown are the boundaries of the `` hockey puck '' region used for the following analysis .",
    "the smooth run exhibits the usual filamentary structure due primarily to the non - linear thin shell instability [ ntsi , @xcite ] , and at later times gravity .",
    "also visible is material which has been `` splashed '' radially outward from the collision region due to the high ram pressures .",
    "the ntsi focuses material into various nodes and by @xmath41  myr the first core ( solid black square ) has formed in one of these nodes . by @xmath42  myr ,",
    "nine cores have formed throughout the complex and by @xmath34  myr , @xmath43 cores have begun to arrange themselves into clusters .",
    "projected parallel ( left ) and perpendicular ( right ) to flow axis , at @xmath36 , and @xmath34  myr for the smooth run .",
    "sink particles appear as small black squares .",
    "tick - marks are spaced every 5 pc and each panel is @xmath44  pc tall . ]    , projected parallel ( left ) and perpendicular ( right ) to flow axis , at @xmath36 , and @xmath34  myr for the clumpy run . sink particles appear as small black squares . ]",
    "the morphology of the clumpy run ( figure [ clumpypanels ] ) is quite different from the smooth run .",
    "the view along the flow axis shows that the clumps are confined to be within the stream by a few pc and they have a tendency to cluster around the perimeter .",
    "this is just an artifact of the clump placing algorithm and can be safely ignored .",
    "there also tends to be much less radial splashing than in the smooth run because the uniform background component prone to being splashed out is only @xmath39th as dense .",
    "the interaction region is much more extended along the flow axis than in the smooth run .",
    "early on , dense clumps run into the lighter background and travel a distance before being destroyed .",
    "the timescale for the clump destruction will be of order the clump crushing time @xmath45 @xcite where @xmath46 is the ` wind velocity ' as seen by the clump and @xmath47 is the density contrast .",
    "since the clump is itself traveling into an oppositely directed flow , @xmath48 and the distance the clump will travel will be of order @xmath49 if the clump survives for a few clump crushing times , it will travel distances of @xmath50  pc before being destroyed .",
    "this explains the more extended interaction region in the upper right panel of figure [ clumpypanels ] . later in time , the clumps pass through a denser wall of material that has built up and they are also pulled back by gravity - so the extent of the collision region shrinks over time .",
    "while the smooth run has formed nine isolated cores by @xmath42  myr distributed throughout the collision region , the clumpy run has only just formed a group of three cores near the center of the global potential well .",
    "by @xmath51  myr , the entire region is undergoing rapid global collapse and a dense group of @xmath52 cores has formed again near the center of the potential well .      to generate spectra",
    "we first take a cube of size @xmath53  pc , centered on the simulation domain . the data within the cube is then windowed with @xmath54    the process of mapping amr data onto a fixed grid often leads to spurious signals at wavelengths corresponding to coarser cell sizes .",
    "to reduce this effect we prolongated in fourier space instead of physical space .",
    "the coarse data within the cube was transformed into fourier space , and the various components were then mapped onto a finer fourier grid . a phase was then added to each fourier component ( since finer cells are not collocated with their coarser parent cells ) before being transformed back into physical space .",
    "then this prolongated grid was updated with existing data on the next finest level and the process was repeated .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows the kinetic and gravitational energy spectra . at @xmath41  myr",
    ", the clumpy run has an excess of kinetic energy at small scales and a lack of kinetic energy at large scales .",
    "while both runs have the same flux of kinetic energy , the clumpy run contains most of the kinetic energy in dense clumps on small scales .",
    "when these flows collide , the clumps are able to maintain coherence until they have travelled a clump shredding distance ( eq .  [ clumpcrushdist ] ) at which point their kinetic energy is able to dissipate . this clump shredding distance can be thought of as a ` driving scale ' for the small scale ` turbulence ' and roughly corresponds to the break in the power spectrum .    by @xmath42  myr , the clumpy run has gained large scale energy due to the onset of global collapse , and by @xmath34  myr the clumpy run has gained energy on all scales due to both the continued global collapse as well as the onset of local collapse . the smooth run on the other hand does not show any growth of large scale kinetic energy , with modest growth of smaller scale kinetic energy .",
    "this picture is confirmed by the gravitational energy spectra - thought it should be mentioned that both spectra are for non - accreted gas .",
    "the overall drop in gravitational energy in the clumpy run between 20.1 and 27.2 myr is due to the very rapid accretion onto sink particles , following the global collapse .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     in the smooth run , there is a higher mass - fraction of well - mixed material ( fig .  [ mixing ] ,",
    "left panel ; note that the total masses in the analysis region at that time are comparable ) .",
    "the clumpy run tends to have a more spread out distribution of mixing ratios than the smooth run .",
    "as clumps drive through the opposing stream - they will shed some of their material and provide varying amounts of mixing .",
    "in the smooth case , the flows interact along a thin interface and it is difficult to get unequal amounts of material from either side in the same region .",
    "one might expect the clumpy run to have less well - mixed cores , yet the right panel of figure [ mixing ] shows just the opposite .",
    "the smooth run has more cores with lower mixing ratios .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that the ntsi creates nodes that act to funnel material streaming into the `` trough '' from only side , while diverting material from the other side .",
    "if so , then cores that formed to the left of the collisional mid - plane should be biased towards the right tracer and vice versa . to test this ,",
    "we define a mixing bias as @xmath55 and plot it against the core s distance from the y - z mid - plane ( fig .",
    "[ mixingbias ] ) .",
    "indeed , cores with negative offsets ( left of mid - plane ) tend to have a higher value for the mixing bias so they have more right tracer and are comprised of material primarily from the right side , and vice versa .",
    "note that this bias is absent in the cores formed in the clumpy run , whose cores are clustered around @xmath56 .    ) against distance of cores to mid - plane , at @xmath34  myr .",
    "smooth cores show a bias , while clumpy cores are clustered around @xmath56 . ]",
    "we present the results of two simulations of flow - driven molecular cloud formation .",
    "the models are identical except for the physical conditions of the inflowing gas .",
    "one model (  smooth \" ) starts out with a completely uniform flow .",
    "the other model (  clumpy \" ) uses the same mass inflow rate , but the gas is distributed in dense clumplets with a filling factor of @xmath9% .",
    "this setup is in parts motivated by pringle s et al .",
    "@xcite claim that in order to form molecular clouds from atomic gas sufficiently fast , dense pockets of already molecular gas should exist in the inflow . here",
    ", we are focusing on the resulting dynamics of smooth versus clumpy inflows .    in both cases ,",
    "the thermal and dynamical fragmentation of the shocked collision region leads to turbulence , at a level of @xmath18 to @xmath52% of the inflowing kinetic energy .",
    "this is consistent with earlier results .",
    "the clumpy run shows a somewhat higher velocity dispersion initially , since the clumps are less easily stopped in a flow collision ( see  [ morphologies ] ) .    due to the lower compression factor in the clumpy model , less gas",
    "is being cooled to higher densities than in the smooth run .",
    "thus , the kinetic energy of the inflow is less efficiently dissipated .",
    "together with a non - contiguous distribution of cold , sub - jeans , fragments , this leads to a suppression of local collapse for nearly @xmath52  myr after the initial flow collision . at that point",
    ", sufficient mass has assembled to induce global collapse of the whole region , resulting in a  star burst \" ( more appropriately ,  sink burst \" ) at a high sink formation rate .",
    "in contrast , the smooth run shows local collapse already after @xmath18  myr , at less than half the sink formation rate of the clumpy run . due to the local nature of the thermal fragmentation",
    ", more fragmentation will occur with increasing resolution @xcite , thus , the times quoted here are _",
    "upper _ limits for the onset of local collapse .",
    "nevertheless , structured flows can delay the onset of ( substantial ) local collapse .",
    "global collapse is only clearly visible in the clumpy run .",
    "the differences between clumpy and smooth inflows extend to the mixing efficiencies . somewhat counter to a naive expectation",
    ", the smooth initial conditions result in less well mixed material ( and cores ) .",
    "this is primarily due to the ntsi funneling material preferentially into the troughs located far into the opposing inflow . for the clumpy run ,",
    "the global collapse of the accumulated clumps erases all memory of the initial inflow direction .",
    "obviously , we have chosen two extremes as our initial conditions .",
    "it is more likely that the inflows themselves will contain turbulent velocity and density structures that are coherent in space .",
    "spatial coherence leads to stronger shocks in the collision region , and thus to more efficient energy dissipation . in that sense ,",
    "our clumpy run is overestimating the effect of structured inflows .",
