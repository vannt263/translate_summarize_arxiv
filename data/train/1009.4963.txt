    "disk - planet interaction is one of the important topics in the planet formation theory .",
    "a low mass planet embedded in a disk excites the density wave ( goldreich and tremaine 1979 ) , and the backreaction from the density wave causes the planet to migrate in the disk ( e.g. , ward 1986 , tanaka et al .",
    "the excitation of density wave at lindblad resonances can be understood by linear analyses , although it has recently been pointed out that non - linear effects are also important at corotation resonances ( paardekooper and papaloizou 2009 ) . for a high mass planet ,",
    "the interaction between the planet and the disk becomes nonlinear , and the gap opens around the planetary orbit ( lin and papaloizou 1986ab , ward and hourigan 1989 , rafikov 2002b , crida et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "gap formation around the planet is important both theoretically and observationally . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", gap formation determines the regime of planetary migration .",
    "if there is no gap opening , planetary migration is in the regime called `` type i '' , where the interaction between the planet and the spiral density wave is important ( goldreich and tremaine 1979 , ward 1986 , 1997 , tanaka et al .",
    "type i planetary migration timescale is considered to be faster than disk dispersal timescale , which poses a serious problem in the theory of planet formation .",
    "if the gap opens around the planet , the migration is in the regime called `` type ii '' , where the planet migrates as the disk accretion onto the central star occurs ( lin and papaloizou 1986 ) .",
    "the timescale of type ii migration , which is of the order of viscous timescale , is generally longer than type i migration , and there may be a possibility for the planets to survive in the disk . from observational point of view , the gap around the planet may be able to be observed by direct imaging .",
    "recent progress of disk observation by direct imaging has reached the stage that it is possible to compare the numerical simulations and observation directly ( mayama et al .",
    "moreover , the dynamical interaction between the circumstellar dust or gas and the planet can be used to estimate the mass of a low - mass object embedded in the disk ( kalas et al .",
    "if the gap in the disk can extend to the disk scale , the gap structure can be a very good indicator of the existence of the planet .",
    "conventionally , gap opening is understood as a balance between the torque exerted by the planet and the viscous torque ( lin and papaloizou 1986b ) .",
    "in addition to the viscous torque , crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) has shown that `` pressure torque '' also acts to balance the planetary torque .",
    "gap opening processes are mainly investigated using one - dimensional model .",
    "rafikov ( 2002b ) calculate the evolution of disk surface density in the vicinity of the planet using a classical one - dimensional model ( lynden - bell and pringle 1974 , pringle 1981 ) .",
    "he has shown that in the vicinity of the low - mass planet , the torque exerted by the planet is carried away by density wave , and the gap is not opened until the wave shocks to deposit the angular momentum to the mean flow .",
    "considering the pressure effects as well as viscous effects , crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have derived the gap opening criterion generalized for arbitrary values of kinematic viscosity using two - dimensional numerical simulation ( equation ( 15 ) of their paper ) .",
    "using the criterion of crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the gap - opening mass for an inviscid disk reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass of the planet , @xmath2 is the mass of the central star , @xmath3 is the scale height of the disk , and @xmath4 is the orbital semi - major axis of the planet . therefore , planets more massive than saturn can open up the gap in the disk .",
    "however , recently , li et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have performed high resolution numerical simulations and showed that a partial gap is formed in the vicinity of the planet even if the mass of the plant is smaller than the mass limit given by equation ( [ cond_crida ] ) in case the disk viscosity is very low .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the physical processes of gap opening in an inviscid disk in detail .    in this paper",
    ", we show that low mass planets can potentially open up a partial gap .",
    "we investigate the processes by means of analytical models taking into account weak non - linearity .",
    "we also perform numerical simulations to look at to what extent numerical calculations and analytic studies agree , and then finally we suggest the criterion for the gap opening in an inviscid disk . for analytic studies , we study the propagation of the spiral density wave and subsequent shock formation .",
    "we then investigate the mass flux in the vicinity of the planet by means of second - order perturbation theory .",
    "we note that the second - order perturbation is necessary to study the mass flux since it is essentially a second - order quantity .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : basiceq ] , we describe the basic equations . in section [ sec :",
    "analytic ] , we investigate the gap opening processes using a second - order perturbation theory . we show that the shock dissipation of density wave and the subsequent formation of specific vorticity can lead to the mass flux in the vicinity of the planet , resulting in the gap formation .",
    "we then show the results of numerical simulations in section [ sec : numerical ] . in section [ sec : gapform ] , we discuss the condition for gap opening in an inviscid disk .",
    "we also discuss that commonly used one - dimensional models of disk evolution may overlook gap opening processes in the vicinity of the planet .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is for summary .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the two - dimensional local shearing - sheet analysis for simplicity .",
    "we set up a local cartesian coordinate system corotating with a planet .",
    "we take the origin of the coordinate system at the planet s location , and the @xmath5- and @xmath6-axes are the radial and the azimuthal direction , respectively .",
    "we use isothermal ideal hydrodynamic equations @xmath7 @xmath8 where we have assumed that the gas is rotating at the kepler velocity .",
    "notations are as follows : @xmath9 is surface density , @xmath10 is velocity field , @xmath11 is sound speed , @xmath12 is the angular velocity of the planet , and @xmath13 is the gravitational potential of the planet . for @xmath13 , we assume the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath1 , and @xmath16 are the gravitational constant , the mass of the planet , and the softening parameter , respectively .",
    "local shearing - sheet approximation is only an approximation of global model , and it may not be appropriate for investigating the global evolution of the disk structure . however , local shearing - sheet approximation and full global model share many essential physics in common .",
    "excitation and the propagation of density wave can be understood using local approximation .",
    "we also show later that one - dimensional disk evolution model constructed from global model and local model are very similar .",
    "local approximation also has the advantages that analyses are greatly simplified and high - resolution calculations become possible .    here , we comment on the two - dimensional approximation .",
    "it is known that three - dimensional processes are important in disk - planet interaction especially when considering the immediate vicinity of the planet .",
    "for example , numerical simulations by paardekooper and mellema ( 2006 ) clearly show that disk structure around the planet is three - dimensional .",
    "however , for the study of density wave , which is the structure away from the location of the planet , the density perturbation by the planet is nearly two - dimensional . in this paper , we shall investigate the physical properties of density wave excited by the planet in detail , and we discuss the gap formation processes that can be derived from the study of density wave .",
    "therefore , we expect that essential physics can be captured by local two - dimensional model .",
    "in this section , we investigate the disk - planet interaction and subsequent gap opening processes using analytic methods .",
    "we consider a weakly non - linear stage , where the mass of the planet is @xmath17 which is approximately smaller than the saturn mass in case of minimum mass solar nebula ( hayashi et al .",
    "1985 ) with @xmath18 ) is equivalent to the condition where hill s radius becomes comparable to the disk scale height .",
    "departure from linear calculations can be observed at this mass range , see e.g. , miyoshi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ] .",
    "we note that non - linearity of disk - planet interaction and gap opening is strongly related . from equation ( [ nonlin_criterion ] ) , the onset of the non - linearity is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the scale height of the disk .",
    "this non - linear criterion is analogous to equation ( [ cond_crida ] ) , which is the gap opening criterion given by crida et al . ( 2006 )    the overall picture of gap formation we suggest is as follows ( see also figure [ fig : gap_schematic ] ) .",
    "1 .   density wave excited by the planet will shock at some location away from the planet .",
    "2 .   the shock formation leads to the formation of specific vorticity .",
    "3 .   the change of specific vorticity results in net radial mass flux .",
    "this mass flux exists in the place closer to the planet , even at the place where the change of specific vorticity is not significant .",
    "gap opens in the vicinity of the planet .",
    "we investigate the shock formation process and the mass flux separately .",
    "shock formation processes are investigated by goodman and rafikov ( 2001 ) and rafikov ( 2002a ) using burgers equation model , and the mass flux is investigated by lubow ( 1990 ) , using second - order perturbation theory . we show how these two theories can be combined to investigate the gap opening processes .    physically , it is natural that the gap opens when spiral density wave damps , since the angular momentum flux carried by the density wave should be transferred to the background flow .",
    "however , we shall show that the decay of the spiral density wave away from the planet can affect the mass flux in the immediate vicinity of the planet , in contrast to the model suggested by rafikov ( 2002b ) , in which there is no gap formation in the vicinity of the planet in inviscid cases .      in this section , as a preparation for the non - linear analyses performed in the subsequent sections",
    ", we briefly summarize the results of linear study of the spiral density wave ( e.g. , goldreich and tremaine 1979 , 1980 ) .",
    "we denote background state by subscript `` 0 '' , and the perturbation by @xmath21 : @xmath22 @xmath23 the planet potential is regarded as a perturbation .",
    "the linearized equations are @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 we now assume the stationary state in the frame corotating with the planet , @xmath27 , and fourier transform in the @xmath6-direction .",

    "the summation in the above equation is taken over the relative integers denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "it is possible to derive a single second - order ordinary differential equation ( artymowicz 1993 ) . @xmath37 and",
    "other perturbed quantities are given by @xmath38    \\label{eq_rho}\\ ] ] and @xmath39 ,    \\label{eq_dvx}\\ ] ] where @xmath40    the boundary condition for equation ( [ eq_dvy ] ) is that wave should propagate away from the planet .",
    "at the location away from the effective lindblad resonance given by @xmath41 the approximate solution can be written analytically using wkb approximation ) is given by parabolic cylinder function , see artymowicz ( 1993 ) for detail . ] .",
    "it takes the form , for @xmath42 , @xmath43 ,     \\label{dvy_sol}\\ ] ] where upper sign is for @xmath44 and the lower sign is for @xmath45 , and @xmath46 denotes the amplitude ( but not necessarily real ) of the wave with mode @xmath33 .",
    "we note that since we consider the linear perturbation excited by the planet s gravitational potential at the origin of our coordinate system , the amplitude @xmath46 is proportional to the planet mass @xmath1 . from here on , using the symmetry of the shearing - sheet , we only consider @xmath44 without loss of generality .",
    "using equations ( [ eq_rho ] ) , ( [ eq_dvx ] ) , and ( [ dvy_sol ] ) , we can derive the asymptotic form for @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath42 , @xmath47    \\exp     \\left [ i { { \\displaystyle \\frac{3}{4 } }   } { { \\displaystyle \\frac{\\omega_{\\rm p } k_y}{c } }   } x^2     \\right ]    \\label{rho_sol}\\ ] ] @xmath48 where we have retained only the leading terms in @xmath5 in equations ( [ eq_rho ] ) and ( [ eq_dvx ] ) . note that , in the real space , solutions are given by @xmath49 ,    \\label{wkb_gen_sol}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the scale height @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath52 for @xmath32 , and @xmath53 is a function of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , along the line @xmath54 where @xmath55 is constant , perturbed quantities take the same values except for the dependence @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , we can write the form of the wkb solution in real space , @xmath57 @xmath58",
    "@xmath59 where we write the dependence on the planet mass explicitly , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are the functions that determines the form of the perturbation . we note that from equation ( [ vx_sol ] ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are proportional in the place where wkb approximation is valid .",
    "the exact linear solution can be obtained by solving equations ( [ eoc_linpert])-([eomy_linpert ] ) numerically with non - reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "the profiles of density and @xmath63 obtained in such a way are shown in figure [ fig : linear_profile ] . in this figure",
    ", we calculate non - axisymmetric modes ( @xmath64 ) and assumed @xmath65 .",
    "the amplitude of perturbation is proportional to the planet mass .",
    "we note that the results obtained in equations ( [ lin_form_dens])-([lin_form_vy ] ) are based on the wkb approximation , and they are applicable only in the region @xmath66 .",
    "goodman and rafikov ( 2001 ) performed a non - linear analysis of the propagation of the spiral density wave , and their local approach was later extended to the global model by rafikov ( 2002a ) . using several approximations",
    "based on the linear theory , they derived the burgers equation which describes the propagation of spiral density wave and concluded that the spiral density wave eventually shocks as it propagates in the radial direction .",
    "they derived that the location of shock formation is proportional to @xmath67 . in this section",
    ", we derive this relationship using a slightly different consideration .",
    "shock is formed when two characteristics cross . for two - dimensional supersonic steady flow",
    ", the gradient of characteristic curves is given by ( landau and lifshitz 1959 ) @xmath68 in the background state of the shearing - sheet , this gives @xmath69 for @xmath44 , @xmath70 is the perturbation propagating away from the origin . at @xmath71 ,",
    "the characteristic curves are given by @xmath72 where @xmath55 is a constant .",
    "it is to be noted that the outgoing characteristics coincides the curve of the same phase of the perturbation of the density wave ( see equation ( [ constphase_lin ] ) ) .",
    "this is because the density wave is essentially the sound wave propagating on the disk .    for the flow distorted by the perturbation of the planet ,",
    "the characteristic curve is also distorted .",
    "using the results of linear perturbation , the gradient of the characteristics is given by @xmath73,\\ ] ] upto the lowest order of perturbation . since the amplitude of @xmath32 decreases with @xmath74 , @xmath32 in the second term of the right hand side can be neglected for @xmath75 . assuming that the perturbed characteristic curve is given by the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 approximating @xmath79 in the argument of @xmath31 , we have @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the function that appears in the linear solution of @xmath31 given by equation ( [ lin_form_vx ] ) . from figure [",

    "@xmath81 is negative for @xmath83 and @xmath81 is positive for @xmath84 .",
    "this indicates that the separation between two characteristic curves shrinks compared to the unperturbed case . assuming that when @xmath85 exceeds a critical value , the shock forms , we obtain , for the location of the shock formation , @xmath86 which is the same condition as derived by goodman and rafikov ( 2001 ) . since the flow is supersonic only at @xmath87 , condition @xmath88 may be more appropriate .",
    "in this section , we consider second - order linear perturbation in order to derive the mass flux in the vicinity of the planet .",
    "although angular momentum flux can be calculated using the results of linear perturbation only , it is necessary to perform second - order analysis to derive the mass flux , since axisymmetric ( @xmath89 ) mode of the second - order perturbation contributes to the mass flux .",
    "lubow ( 1990 ) performed the time - dependent analysis using fourier and laplace transformation . in this paper , we calculate second order perturbation in real space .",

    "however , if there is a formation of vorticity by , for example , shock damping of the spiral density wave , this term can not be neglected .",
    "we also note that if stationary state is assumed a priori , and if there is no formation of specific vorticity , the source term @xmath111 is zero , leading to the zero mass flux ( lubow 1990 , muto and inutsuka 2009a ) .",
    "however , if time - evolution effects are taken into account , we have non - zero mass flux .",
    "the solution for equation ( [ eq_mdot ] ) is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the green s function @xmath114      0    &      \\mathrm{otherwise }    \\end{array }    \\right.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the bessel function of zeroth order .",
    "from linear perturbation , it is possible to predict that the mass flux scales with @xmath116 , since the source term is the second order of perturbation . later in this paper",
    ", we compare this result with numerical calculations to understand how much mass flux is excited by the planet .",
    "we now consider the model in which the source term is given by @xmath117      s_0 \\left [ \\delta_d(x - x_s ) - \\delta_d(x+x_s ) \\right ]   &      t>0    \\end{array }    \\right.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are positive constants , and @xmath120 denotes the dirac s delta function .",

    "we note that divergence at @xmath137 is the artefact of our simplification where we have used delta function as a source term .",
    "we have seen that if there is a source of specific vorticity , mass flux appears in the vicinity of the planet , and it leads to the change of surface density to open a gap .",
    "we now briefly discuss how this gap opening process ends .",
    "an inviscid disk with a rapid surface density variation is prone to a linear instability , which is referred to as rossby wave instability ( li et al . 2000 , de val - borro et al .",
    "2007 ) . in appendix",
    "[ app : rwi ] , we show a brief outline of the linear stability analyses for a disk with a gap , and derive the necessary conditions for the instability .",
    "gap induced by a planet in the disk naturally excites the variation of specific vorticity , and gap edges are likely places where such instability occurs .",
    "rossby wave instability may stop the gap - opening processes described in previous subsections . we do not expect that the instability leads to the complete closing of the gap , since the planet always try to repel the fluid element by the excitation of the density wave",
    ". there may be at least `` underdense region '' around the planetary orbit , which may be called a `` gap '' .",
    "we have discussed the non - linear shock formation of density wave in section [ subsec : shock ] .",
    "the formation of shock leads to the formation of specific vorticity in general , and the perturbation of specific vorticity can lead to the radial mass flux as discussed in section [ subsec : second ] .",
    "the gap formation may end by the onset of the linear instability of the disk with a gap . in order to investigate this qualitative picture of gap formation ,",
    "we perform two - dimensional numerical calculations in the subsequent section .",
    "we note that in this picture of gap formation , the decay of angular momentum flux carried by the spiral density wave is not directly connected to the mass flux .",
    "for example , when we model the source of mass flux by @xmath21-function in equation ( [ source_model ] ) , we implicitly assume that the spiral density wave does not dissipate at @xmath138 , but we still end up with non - zero mass flux in this region , see equation ( [ mdot_model_sol ] ) .",
    "one may consider that this result violates the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "it is actually satisfied , when time evolution effects are taken into account .",
    "we shall discuss further on the angular momentum conservation in section [ subsec:1d ] .",
    "we solve euler equations ( [ eoc_full ] ) and ( [ eom_full ] ) with isothermal equation of state using second - order godunov scheme ( e.g. , colella and woodward 1984 ) . in order to investigate the density wave propagation",
    "while resolving all the length scales ( hill radius , bondi radius , and radial wavelength of the density wave ) , we need to use rather large box size with relatively high resolution .",
    "we choose the box size @xmath139 with mesh number @xmath140 , which results in the resolution @xmath141 .",
    "we have also used the box with different @xmath36 to investigate the box size effect .    from equation ( [ wkb_gen_sol ] ) , the radial wavelength of the wave with mode @xmath33 may be approximated by @xmath142 the most important modes are @xmath143 . for mode with @xmath144 at @xmath145 , the wavelength of the density wave",
    "is given by @xmath146 , and therefore , the radial wavelength is resolved by eight meshes if we use @xmath147 .",
    "higher - order modes or the wave outside this regions are damped numerically .",
    "therefore , we mainly use data within @xmath148 in the analyses of the numerical results .",
    "if we normalize the length by @xmath20 and the time by @xmath149 , the only dimensionless parameter in this calculation is the planet mass , or bondi radius @xmath150 and the softening parameter @xmath151 .",
    "we use the softening length used in previous local shearing - sheet calculations @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the hill s radius @xmath154 ( miyoshi et al . 1999 ) .",

    "note that bondi radius , hill radius , and the softening parameter are resolved ( at least marginally ) for the smallest mass model .",
    "we have increased the planet mass linearly from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "the result does not depend significantly on this timescale if the timescale is longer than this .    in the @xmath5-direction , we use non - reflecting boundary used by fargo ( baruteau 2008 ) , modified for the shearing - sheet . for the @xmath6-direction",

    ". this boundary condition may be appropriate to study the flow structure only in the vicinity of the planet , but for the study of gap formation , this boundary condition is inappropriate because this forces the unperturbed gas flowing into the computational domain .",
    "we also note that periodic boundary condition in the @xmath6-direction is useful for the purpose of comparison with the linear analyses , which assume the periodicity in the @xmath6-direction .",

    "we later see that this specific vorticity becomes a dominant source of mass flux , which leads to the formation of a gap .",
    "for the numerical calculation with @xmath159 , we also see the formation of specific vorticity around @xmath162 .",
    "this is because the fluid elements in the vicinity of the planet orbit around it , and as a result , a vortex is formed just around the planet .",
    "the formation of a vortex at the planet location causes the vortex circulating in the opposite direction , which makes a horseshoe orbit in the corotation region . for the calculation with @xmath158",
    ", similar thing happens , but the vortices formed by shock dissipation are stronger . in subsequent sections , we show that vortices just in the vicinity of the planet location does not produce a significant amount of mass flux .",
    "figure [ fig : vort_pert ] shows the azimuthally - integrated specific vorticity perturbation as a function of @xmath163 . if shock dissipation occurs as equation ( [ shockform_cond ] ) , the peak of the specific vorticity perturbation comes at the same location of the horizontal axis .",

    ", it is not the case .",
    "this is because the shock formation occurs immediately after the excitation of the wave at @xmath165 , and therefore in the unit of @xmath163 , the shock occurs relatively further away .",
    "we now look at the radial mass flux @xmath166 excited by the planet . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdot_fit ] , we show the azimuthally averaged mass flux obtained by numerical calculation .",
    "it is possible to see that there is a spike of the mass flux just in the vicinity of the planet , and then the mass flux depends linearly with the distance from the planet within @xmath167 .",
    "the spike in the vicinity of the planet is due to the gas falling onto the planet .",
    "this causes the spike of the surface density profile in the vicinity of the planet as shown in figure [ fig : gap_evolution ] .",
    "we expect that this feature depends on the treatment of the planet , and such mass flux should be investigated carefully when one wants to look at the processes such as gas accretion onto the planet .",
    "however , as we will see later , the feature in this spike region does not affect the mass flux outside this region . in the discussion",

    "it is possible to observe that the second - order perturbation theory is valid for calculations with low - mass planet , while for calculations with @xmath158 , the perturbation theory fails to explain the amount of mass flux .",
    "we find that the second - order perturbation theory can be used for @xmath168 .",

    "we first look at the source term of the mass flux given by equations ( [ source_vort ] ) and ( [ source_time ] ) .",
    "we have used the results of numerical calculations to calculate the perturbed values that appear in these two equations .",
    "figure [ fig : source_evol ] shows the evolution of the source of mass flux given by ( [ source_vort ] ) and ( [ source_time ] ) for the calculation with @xmath159 .",
    "we see that the term with @xmath169 is not significant after the planet mass is fully introduced at @xmath170 .",
    "the term @xmath109 depends on time strongly in the vicinity of the planet , while nearly time - independent contribution is observed from the region @xmath171 .",
    "the source arising in the vicinity of the planet comes from the vortex making a horseshoe orbit , while the source at @xmath171 comes from shock formation .    in order to look at which contribution excites the mass flux more effectively , we calculate the mass flux by artificially cutting the source term at @xmath172 .",
    "figure [ fig : mdot_sourceterm ] compares the mass flux obtained by doing so and the mass flux obtained by using the full source term .",
    "we have used equation ( [ mdot_sol ] ) with the source terms obtained by numerical calculation to derive the mass flux .",
    "it is clear that the source in the vicinity of the planet does not contribute to the mass flux very much .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the mass flux arises from the specific vorticity generated by the shock dissipation of density wave .",
    "we now discuss the dependence of mass flux on the box size in the @xmath6-direction , @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig : variablely ] shows the azimuthally integrated mass flux @xmath173 with @xmath174 for different box length @xmath36 .",
    "these mass fluxes are directly calculated from the numerical simulations .",
    "the lines show a perfect match for different box sizes .",
    "this can be explained if we notice that the angular momentum flux carried by the density wave does not depend on the box size . as the spiral density wave damps , the angular momentum carried by the wake",
    "is deposited to the background disk to drive the mass flux .",
    "the total amount of the angular momentum deposited over the @xmath6-direction does not depend on the box size , since the amount of angular momentum flux carried by the wave does not depend on the box size .",
    "we now discuss the timescale for the gap - opening in the vicinity of the planet . as stated at the end of section [ subsec : second ] , the mass flux in the vicinity of the planet is expected to be proportional to @xmath5 , and if second - order analysis is valid , we expect that the mass flux is proportional to the square of the planet mass .",
    "we therefore fit the mass flux within @xmath175 using the function of the form @xmath176 where k is a constant that is derived by fitting the results of the numerical simulations .",
    "we found @xmath177 can fit the numerical results upto @xmath178 within 15% error for @xmath179 .",
    "figure [ fig : mdot_fit ] compares the mass flux obtained by numerical simulation and the fitting function ( [ massflux_fit ] ) .",
    "since the gap opening timescale may be determined by @xmath180 and the denominator is approximated by @xmath181 , the gap - opening timescale is proportional to @xmath36 . using the result of equation ( [ massflux_fit ] ) , we have @xmath182 note that this timescale applies to the initial phase of gap opening , and it does not state about how deep the gap will be .",
    "the box size in the @xmath6-direction may be interpreted as a circumference of the disk .",
    "the above expression can be rewritten as @xmath183      in section [ subsec : gapinst ] , we have seen that the disk with a density bump can be prone to linear instability .",
    "figure [ fig : gapinst_m06 ] shows the evolution of azimuthally averaged density perturbation and mass flux in the calculation with @xmath184 .",
    "we see that the mass flux changes the sign very rapidly , and the gap depth saturates when approximately half of the original mass is depleted .",
    "the width of the gap we have obtained is of the order of several scale height of the disk .",
    "it seems that the gap width still increases gradually .",
    "this may be explained quantitatively as follows .",
    "the perturbation by the planet tries to deposit the angular momentum to the disk in such a way that the fluid elements to migrate away from the planet .",
    "turbulence may try to redistribute the angular momentum , but at the same time , diffusion in the radial direction occurs because of the turbulence . therefore , not all the angular momentum deposited to the disk is absorbed by turbulence , and a part of the angular momentum goes to the background , and the gap gradually becomes wider and wider .",
    "it may be possible to form a wider gap .",
    "the final state of the gap may not be able to capture in the local shearing - sheet calculation since the radial extent of the calculation box is not very wide .",
    "( 2009 ) obtained a partial gap ( approximately half of the gas depleted ) with the width of about @xmath185 for the parameter @xmath186 ( see figure 2 of their paper ) .",
    "although it may be possible that the final width and the shape of the gap is not well - determined in the shearing - sheet calculations , the gap formation process described in the previous sections may be valid .",
    "we interpret the gap depth and width obtained in our calculation as minimum values .",
    "planets may potentially be able to open a deeper and wider gap .",
    "we note that crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and de val - borro et al .",
    "( 2007 ) obtained deeper and wider gap for a jupiter mass planet , although they assumed very low or zero viscosity .",
    "in this section , using the results of numerical calculations , we discuss the validity of conventional one - dimensional model for gap formation and the condition of gap opening .",
    "the gap formation processes are modeled using one - dimensional disk evolution model .",
    "thommes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) uses a model in which the torque exerted at the lindblad resonances are directly deposited to the disk to change the semi - major axis of the fluid particle .",
    "rafikov ( 2002b ) uses a one - dimensional model based on lynden - bell and pringle ( 1974 ) type surface density evolution equation to model gap formation processes .",
    "we investigate whether such treatment can reproduce the evolution of the density profile obtained in two - dimensional calculations .",
    "although we have performed shearing - sheet analyses , we first note that global calculation and local shearing - sheet calculation share very similar property if we consider the azimuthally - averaged one - dimensional model .",
    "this can be investigated by comparing the one - dimensional model derived using global model and local model ( see appendix [ app:1dmodel ] ) .",
    "exact one - dimensional evolution model is given by equations ( [ eoc_1dmodel_local ] ) and ( [ eomy_1dmodel_local_mod ] ) in local approximation .",
    "whether the evolution model ( [ dens_evolution_1d_local ] ) can be used depends on whether the approximation made in deriving this equation is appropriate .",
    "this can be seen whether mass flux , angular momentum , and the torque exerted by the planet are related as equation ( [ mdot_angmom_1d_local ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdot_angmom_relation ] , we compare each term of equation ( [ mdot_angmom_1d_local ] ) . we observe that the relationship of this equation is not satisfied , indicating the time evolution of @xmath187 occurs .",
    "we have checked that the exact time evolution equation ( [ eomy_1dmodel_local_mod ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we therefore argue that time evolution of density and rotation profile is given by equation ( [ eoc_1dmodel_local ] ) and ( [ eomy_1dmodel_local_mod ] ) , and in constructing one - dimensional model , it is necessary to specify the model of the mass flux , as well as the torque and angular momentum flux .",
    "it is especially important in considering the gap formation in the vicinity of the planet orbit .",
    "for example , rafikov ( 2002b ) predicts nothing happens in the vicinity of the planet in an inviscid model unless the spiral density wave shocks . in two - dimensional simulation , in contrast , we also observe gap opening even in low - mass planet calculations .",
    "as the gap opens , rotation velocity of the gas is also modified in order to balance the pressure gradient , as crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) pointed out .",
    "we have seen that low - mass planets can potentially open a gap , or at least a ring with low surface density , in an inviscid disk .",
    "we now discuss the minimum mass of the planet that can open the gap .",
    "low mass planets are prone to type i migration and therefore , if the planet migrates before it opens a gap , gap formation is impossible .",
    "since the width of the gap is the order of scale height @xmath3 , we compare the timescale of the planet migration over length @xmath3 and the gap formation timescale .",
    "the planet migration timescale in an isothermal disk is estimated by tanaka et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as @xmath188 note that the power of @xmath189 is @xmath190 because we consider the migration over the radial length @xmath3 . for gap",
    "formation timescale , we use the results of numerical calculations given in section [ subsec : result ] .",
    "the gap opening timescale @xmath191 is given by equation ( [ gaptime_est1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath192 , we expect the gap will open in the vicinity of the planet . comparing @xmath193 and @xmath194 , we obtain @xmath195 we have used typical values of protoplanetary disk at @xmath196 to estimate the number .",
    "we note that the gap - opening mass scales with the box size @xmath36 . if we assume @xmath197 and @xmath198 , @xmath199 , which gives @xmath200 , which is below the criterion given in previous studies , e.g. , equation ( [ cond_crida ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ cond_inviscid ] ) rewritten by using @xmath201 reads ( see also equation([gaptime_est2 ] ) ) @xmath202    it is interesting to compare equation ( [ cond_inviscid ] ) with the previous criterion ( [ cond_crida ] )",
    ". equation ( [ cond_inviscid ] ) is derived by comparing the gap opening timescale and type i migration timescale , and this is qualitatively different from the way the previous criterion is derived .",
    "for example , the gap opening criterion derived in this study , equation ( [ cond_inviscid ] ) , depends on the disk mass , since type i migration timescale scales with the disk mass .",
    "we also note that the type i migration timescale may be much longer if the corotation torque and non - barotropic effects are considered ( paardekooper et al .",
    "in this case , our results indicate that the gap may be opened for lower mass planets , although more thorough analyses of non - barotropic effects on spiral density wave and mass flux are necessary .",
    "if the disk is in turbulent state , the effective viscosity can also act to fill the gap . if we use standard @xmath203-prescription for turbulent viscosity @xmath204 ,",
    "the timescale of viscous diffusion over length scale @xmath205 is @xmath206 if @xmath207 is shorter than @xmath194 , we expect that the gap is filled .",
    "this leads to another condition , @xmath208 or if we use @xmath201 instead of @xmath36 , @xmath209 the disk must be quiet in order for a low - mass planets to open up the gap , but we note that the condition is very sensitive to the disk aspect ratio .",
    "we note that the previous results for gap - opening criterion derived by crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is somewhat different from equation ( [ gapcond_vis ] ) .",
    "since we derive equation ( [ gapcond_vis ] ) using a crude order - of - magnitude estimate for viscous diffusion , it is necessary to perform more systematic parameter study in order to investigate how much viscosity is necessary to halt gap - opening by a planet .",
    "the gap - opening criteria , equations ( [ cond_inviscid ] ) and ( [ gapcond_vis ] ) , are more exactly the conditions for the `` formation of under - dense region around the planetary orbit '' .",
    "we compare the timescale for the decrease of surface density , which is derived from the mass flux induced by the planet , and the type i migration timescale or viscous diffusion timescale .",
    "therefore , these conditions concern the initial phase of the gap - opening , and the timescale argument does not concern how deep the gap will be as a result of long - term evolution .",
    "the condition by crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is , on the other hand , the condition for the formation of `` deep gap '' , or more quantitatively the formation of the gap where @xmath210 of the original amount of gas is depleted .",
    "therefore , the conditions are not necessarily in contradiction with each other .",
    "for example , in the case of the numerical calculation with @xmath211 , @xmath212 , which is slightly above the gap - opening criterion by crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : gapinst_m06 ] , we observe a gap where approximately @xmath213 of the original gas mass is depleted , which is just below the depth of the gap which is predicted by crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) this may suggest that the prediction by crida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and our calculation is in qualitative agreement , although the setting of our calculation is different from theirs . our condition , however , still has a new aspect since it states that the gap - opening process may be different in case of inviscid case .",
    "non - linear evolution of density wave and the feedback onto the disk can be important when we consider an inviscid disk .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the disk - planet interaction and the evolution of surface density profile of the disk using analytic methods and high - resolution numerical calculations within the framework of shearing - sheet approximation .",
    "we have shown some analytic framework to understand the non - linearity of disk - planet interaction .",
    "formation of specific vorticity by shock dissipation of density wave can be a source of disk mass flux in the vicinity of the planet , which results in the formation of gap around the embedded planet .",
    "we estimate the conditions of the formation of the underdense region , or gap formation , around the planetary orbit , and it is indicated that a planet with 20 - 30 earth mass at @xmath196 will open a gap in a standard minimum mass solar nebula with @xmath214 .",
    "we note that our condition applies to the initial phase of the gap opening , and the condition depends on the type i migration timescale , which can be much longer than that given by tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) formula .",
    "if type i migration is halted , much lower mass planets can open a gap . in an inviscid case , which we have explored in this paper ,",
    "the width of the gap is of the order of the disk scale height .",
    "we note that we have not discussed the final gap depth in detail in this paper , although it is indicated that the gap opening process ends by the onset of hydrodynamic instability when approximately half of the mass is depleted .",
    "one may call such a shallow underdense region a `` dip '' or `` partial gap '' , rather than gap .",
    "we have also discussed that classical one - dimensional model of disk evolution fails to describe gap opening process , and more refined one - dimensional is necessary to explain gap opening .",

    "<S> we analyze the physical processes of gap formation in an inviscid protoplanetary disk with an embedded protoplanet using two - dimensional local shearing - sheet model . </S>",
    "<S> spiral density wave launched by the planet shocks and the angular momentum carried by the wave is transferred to the background flow . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange of the angular momentum can affect the mass flux in the vicinity of the planet to form an underdense region , or gap , around the planetary orbit . </S>",
    "<S> we first perform weakly non - linear analyses to show that the specific vorticity formed by shock dissipation of density wave can be a source of mass flux in the vicinity of the planet , and that the gap can be opened even for low - mass planets unless the migration of the planet is substantial . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform high resolution numerical simulations to check analytic consideration . by comparing the gap opening timescale and type i migration timescale </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a criterion for the formation of underdense region around the planetary orbit that is qualitatively different from previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum mass required for the planet to form a dip is twice as small as previous studies if we incorporate the standard values of type i migration timescale , but it can be much smaller if there is a location in the disk where type i migration is halted . </S>"
