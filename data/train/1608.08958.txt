    "a large number of cosmological and astrophysical observations provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe .",
    "the amount of cold dark matter ( cdm ) has been precisely estimated from the measurement of cdm by the planck satellite mission to be @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the nature of dm particles and their properties is the subject of intense investigation .",
    "one of the main physics programmes at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is devoted to the detection of the dm .",
    "there is the real possibility of the production of dm particles of any spin at 13 tev centre - of - mass energy , and the atlas and the cms collaborations are closely examining several dm signatures involving missing energy , @xmath2 , accompanied by a single or two jet events  @xcite .",
    "in addition there are direct detection experiments which measure the nuclear - recoil energy and its spectrum in dm - nucleon elastic scattering .",
    "the indirect detection experiments look for signals of dm annihilation into standard model ( sm ) particles in cosmic rays , and have detection instruments mounted on satellites and on ground based telescopes  @xcite .",
    "effective field theories ( eft ) in which the dm - sm interactions are mediated by heavy particles which are not accessible at the lhc energies have been analysed in detail and the limits from direct and indirect searches examined .",
    "recently the need to go beyond these eft models has been pointed out in light of the large energy accessible at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "simplified models of dm with these interactions to sm particles have emerged as attractive alternative to eft models . in these models",
    "the interaction between the dm and sm particles are mediated by spin-0 and spin-1 particles in the s - channel , whereas in the t - channel models , the mediator can be a scalar , a fermion or a vector particle which will typically also carry colour or lepton number  @xcite .    in this paper we consider a minimal sm singlet spin-3/2 vector - like fermion @xmath3 as a dm candidate , interacting with the sm particles through the exchange of a spin-1 mediator , @xmath4 , in a minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xmath0-channel model .",
    "spin-3/2 particles exist in several models beyond the sm , namely in models of supergravity where the graviton is accompanied by spin-3/2 gravitino superpartners .",
    "spin-3/2 fermions also exist in kaluza - klein models , in string theory , and in models of composite fermions  @xcite .",
    "recently spin-3/2 cdm has been studied in eft models and constraints from direct and indirect observations obtained  @xcite .",
    "spin-3/2 , 7.1 kev warm dark matter ( wdm ) has also been considered as a means to provide a viable explanation from the anomalous 3.1 kev x - ray line observed by the xmm newton  @xcite . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce the spin-3/2 cdm in an mfv @xmath0-channel model . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we discuss all relevant experimental constraints including the relic density and also examine the signature of these dm particles at the lhc .",
    "in section  [ sec:4 ] we summarise our main results .",
    "the sm is extended by including a spin-3/2 vector like particle @xmath3 whose right - handed ( rh ) as well as left - handed ( lh ) projections transform the same way under the sm gauge group .",
    "we further let @xmath5 to be a sm singlet which interacts with the sm particles through the exchange of a vector particle @xmath4 in the @xmath0-channel , where this can be done , for example , by extending the sm gauge symmetry with a new @xmath6 gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken such that the mediator obtains a mass @xmath7 .",
    "we also invoke a discrete @xmath8 symmetry under which the spin-3/2 dm particle @xmath5 is odd , whereas all other sm particles , including the vector mediator @xmath9 , are even .",
    "the spin-3/2 free lagrangian is given by  @xcite : @xmath10 with @xmath11 where @xmath3 satisfies @xmath12 , and with @xmath5 on mass - shell we have @xmath13 the spin sum for spin-3/2 fermions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given by  @xcite : @xmath16.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the interaction of this spin-1 mediator with the sm - fermions and the dm @xmath17 is not restricted by mfv to be either vector or axial vector , and can be written in terms of the vector and axial - vector couplings as @xmath18 in general this interaction will induce flavour - changing neutral currents which are strongly constrained by low energy phenomenology .",
    "the constraints can be avoided by imposing a mfv structure on the couplings or by restricting the interactions to one generation .",
    "the decay width @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad \\quad+ \\frac{m_{z^{\\prime}}}{108\\pi } \\left(\\frac{m^{2}_{\\chi}}{m^{2}_{z^{\\prime}}}\\right )   \\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m_{\\chi}^{2}}{m^{2}_{z^{\\prime } } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\quad\\quad \\times \\bigg [ ( g_{\\chi}^{v})^{2}\\left(36 - 2\\frac{m^{2}_{z^{\\prime}}}{m^{2}_{\\chi}}- 2\\frac{m^{4}_{z^{\\prime}}}{m^{4}_{\\chi } }   + \\frac{m^{6}_{z^{\\prime}}}{m^{6}_{\\chi}}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad + ( g_{\\chi}^{a})^{2 } \\left(-40 + 26\\frac{m^{2}_{z^{\\prime}}}{m^{2}_{\\chi } } - 8 \\frac{m^{4}_{z^{\\prime}}}{m^{4}_{\\chi } }   + \\frac{m^{6}_{z^{\\prime}}}{m^{6}_{\\chi}}\\right ) \\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "there are several interesting consequences on the dm mass and couplings arising from the decay width expressions . if the dm mass @xmath21 , the only decay channel available to the mediator @xmath4 is into sm fermions .",
    "since @xmath22 , for the case of vector coupling @xmath23 we get @xmath24 and similarly for the axial coupling .",
    "however , if dm mass @xmath25 , allowing the mediator to decay into dm pairs , there is a minimum limit on the dm mass , given by roughly @xmath26 in what follows we consider the vector and axial - vector couplings separately , and for simplicity use universal couplings @xmath27 and @xmath28 and further restricting ourselves to one generation of sm fermions . in figure  [ fig:1 ]",
    "we have plotted the mediator @xmath4 decay width as a function of @xmath29 for some benchmark values of the couplings @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that there exists a minimum @xmath29 mass for a given coupling . a mass less than this limit gives unphysical values of the decay width .",
    "this feature is peculiar to the spin-3/2 nature of the dm .",
