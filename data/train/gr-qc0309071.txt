    "it is well known that black holes and neutron stars have their characteristic  sound  : quasinormal modes , which were originally found to play a prominent role in the gravitational radiation theoretically and were hoped to be detected in the gravitational experiments ( see@xcite and references therein for review ) .",
    "they have been extensively studied recently for their possible connection with the quantum gravity through an observation made by dreyer in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the author fixed the free parameter @xmath8 of loop quantum gravity(lqg ) and suggested the gauge group of lqg may be @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 .",
    "this is remarkable@xcite and surely makes a good example of utilizing the macroscopic behavior of black holes to deduce their microscopic nature .",
    "besides the application in lqg , the quasinormal modes are also used in many other fields , especially the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , from the ads / cft correspondence , the quasinormal modes of the ads black hole are used to determine the relaxation time of a field perturbation , i.e. , the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency is proportional to the inverse of the damping time of a given mode .",
    "hod and piran@xcite considered the behavior of a charged scalar field perturbation and found that , its quasinormal modes will dominate the radiation in the late time evolution for their slower decay than the neutral ones .",
    "konoplya , in his work@xcite , first investigated a complex ( charged ) scalar field perturbation through calculating its quasinormal modes in the reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) , rnads and dialton black holes and found that , on the contrary , the neutral perturbations will decay slower than the charged ones at the stage of quasinormal ringing . in this paper , we turn to treat the spin @xmath11 dirac particles , in the presence of the rn  black holes with charge @xmath0 . calculating quasinormal frequencies of the neutrino field ( charge @xmath1 ) perturbations and those of the massless dirac field ( charge @xmath2 ) perturbations in the rn metric",
    ", we found that when the product @xmath12 is positive , the quasinormal modes of the massless dirac field decay faster than those of the neutral ones and when @xmath12 is negative , the perturbations of the massless dirac field decay slower than those of the neutral field .",
    "the detailed discussions can be found in the following sections .    in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] , in the rn metric , we will calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the neutrino field perturbations and those of the massless dirac field perturbations . in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] , with some figures and tables , we show clearly what influence the charge of the black hole brings to the behavior of the quasinormal modes , including the energy and the decay rate .",
    "[ sec.4 ] is a summary with some suggestions about the future research .",
    "we shall calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the massless dirac field perturbations and the neutrino field perturbations in the rn metric @xmath13 the wave equation can be written as @xmath14\\psi = 0 . \\label{diraceq}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ diraceq ] ) , @xmath15 are the dirac matrices with the forms @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath18 is the inverse of the tetrad @xmath19 defined by the spacetime metric @xmath20 @xmath21 are the spin connection given by @xmath22 e_a^{~\\nu } e_{b\\nu ; \\mu } , \\",
    "e_{b\\nu ; \\mu } = \\partial _ \\mu e_{b\\nu } -\\gamma _ { \\mu \\nu } ^ae_{ba},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 are the christoffel symbols . and",
    ", @xmath24 is the electromagnetic potential of the black hole .    in the following discussions , we adopt the natural unit , @xmath25 .",
    "it means that all physical quantities , such as mass , length , charge , time , energy , and so on , are dimensionless .",
    "the following replacing relations can be used to restore all of them :    @xmath26    for the rn spacetime , the electromagnetic potential @xmath24 can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath0 is the charge of the rn black hole , and @xmath3 is zero for neutrinos and nonzero for dirac particles . in the following",
    "we shall see that we can just consider the sign of the product @xmath12 without taking into consideration the sign of each quantity respectively .",
    "therefore , for convenience we shall take @xmath0 to be always positive and only switch the sign of @xmath3 , when we are studying the influence of the charge of the black hole on the quasinormal frequencies of the dirac field perturbations .    for the rn spacetime",
    ", we can select the tetrad @xmath19 as @xmath28 using the ansatz @xcite , @xmath29 where for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and for @xmath32 , @xmath33 we can get the radial part of the wave equation @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 can be expressed as @xmath38 with @xmath39 where @xmath40 equals @xmath4 in the ( @xmath41 ) case and @xmath42 in the ( @xmath43 ) case , and the momentum quantum number @xmath4 is a non - negative integer .",
    "one may notice that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are supersymmetric partners of the superpotential @xmath46@xcite , and they will give the same quasinormal frequencies .",
    "so , in the following work , we only discuss the @xmath47 case where the momentum quantum number @xmath4 equals @xmath40 .",
    "[ fig.1 ] shows the potential barrier of the three cases mentioned above with the maximal values @xmath48",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 which can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) . and from fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , we can see the peak of the potential barrier increases with @xmath4 and its position @xmath51 approaches a limit .    to evaluate the quasinormal frequencies , we adopt the third - order wkb approximation , which was originally proposed by schutz , iyer and will@xcite and recently developed by konoplya to the sixth - order beyond the eikonal approximation@xcite .",
    "this method has wide applications in many black hole cases , and has high accuracy for the low - lying modes with @xmath52 , where @xmath5 and @xmath4 are the mode number and the momentum quantum number respectively . from ref .",
    "@xcite , the expression of the quasinormal frequencies is @xmath53 -i\\left ( n+\\frac 12\\right ) \\left ( -2v_0^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) ^{1/2}\\left ( 1+\\omega \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the second and third order wkb correction terms @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "here , @xmath58 is the maximal value of the potential , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 are the second , third and @xmath62th order derivatives of @xmath58 , with respect to @xmath63 .    subsituting the effective potential of eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) into the above formula , we can get the quasinormal frequencies for the three classes : @xmath1 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 . to get numerical results ,",
    "the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath66 , and @xmath3 should be fixed . without loss of generality , we take @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath1,@xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the results are listed in the tables [ table1 ] , [ table2 ] , [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] , respectively .",
    "as the main concern of this paper , we will discuss the influence of the charge of the rn black hole on the behavior of quasinormal modes in two aspects : how do the quasinormal modes vary with respect to @xmath3 ( the charge of the particle ) and @xmath0 ( the charge of the black hole ) . and following that we will also discuss the momentum quantum number @xmath4 and the mode number @xmath5 .",
    "thus , this section can be separated into four parts .    from eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , we know that we can just consider the sign of the product @xmath12 without taking into account the sign of each quantity respectively . as is mentioned above , we take @xmath0 to be always positive , and only switch the sign before @xmath3 .",
    "thus , before we move into the discussions , we have to emphasize that positive values of @xmath3 actually means that the product @xmath6 , and _",
    "vice versa_.    in the following discussions of the quasinormal modes , we focus on the real part and the imaginary part respectively .",
    "the real part gives us information of the energy of the emitted particles and from the imaginary part we can find out the damping time .",
    "@xmath76 _ the influence of the particle charge _",
    "@xmath3 : from table [ table1 ] , we can see how the quasinormal modes behave when the field changes from neutral to charged cases .",
    "@xmath77 first we study the real part , @xmath78 : as an example , we study the case , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 . here",
    "three values @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 correspond to @xmath85 , @xmath1 , @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "we can see that @xmath87 . actually , this result is valid for all cases in table [ table1 ] . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we can further find out the influence of the absolute value of @xmath3 , and a monotonic behavior is revealed in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , i.e. , for each given value of @xmath0 , @xmath88 increases as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "@xmath89 then we turn to the imaginary part , @xmath90 , of the quasinormal modes .",
    "similarly , first we consider the sign of @xmath3 . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , we can see that when @xmath3 is @xmath91 , the absolute values of the imaginary part of quasinormal frequencies are bigger than those of the neutrino field and when @xmath3 is @xmath92 , the situation is to the contrary . if we take into consideration the value of @xmath3 , as is shown in table [ table2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] , we also observe a monotonic behavior , i.e. , the absolute value of @xmath90 increases as @xmath3 increases .    if we bear in mind that the sign of @xmath3 actually denotes that of the product @xmath12 , we can summarize the above conclusions as the following : with larger values of @xmath3 , the particles have smaller energy and they decay faster .",
    "@xmath93 _ the influence of the black hole charge _",
    "@xmath0 : in recent studies reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author investigated the influence of the black hole charge on the complex scalar field perturbation ( charged ) in the rn spacetime .",
    "it is shown clearly in the figures that the real part of the quasinormal modes of both neutral and charged scalar field grows as @xmath0 increases , and the latter grows more rapidly .",
    "on the other hand , the imaginary part of a given  charged mode  approaches the neutral one in the extremal limit @xmath94 . in this paper , following the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the higher multipole number perturbations of the dirac field with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath81 , and the results can be found in table [ table2 ]",
    ".    @xmath98 the real part , @xmath88 : from fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] we can see it also increases with @xmath0 and another character : compared with the neutrino field , @xmath88 of the perturbations charged @xmath91 and @xmath69 are smaller in both the value and the increasing speed with respect to @xmath0 , however things are different in the cases @xmath86 and @xmath99 which shows the influence from the @xmath0 mentioned above : making the perturbations weaker in the case @xmath65 and stronger in the case @xmath100    @xmath101 the imaginary part , @xmath90 : from fig . [ fig.4 ] and table [ table2 ] , we find although no coincidence of the neutrino and the charged dirac field perturbations in the extremal limit exists , there is a turning point separating a monotonically increasing region and a decreasing region ( note that there is a similar point for the scalar fields , see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "the explanation of this fact is still unclear but some further work may be helpful , such as finding the relationship between the position of the turning point and the value of @xmath0 , for different fields .",
    "@xmath102 _ the influence of _ @xmath4 : it can be revealed by tuning the value of @xmath4 with the other parameters fixed . as an example , taking @xmath81 , @xmath79 , @xmath1 , @xmath103 , from table [ table3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , we can see that @xmath88 keeps growing with @xmath4 at the speed of @xmath104 , which shows the contribution of the angular momentum to the energy of the emitted particles . as is already discussed above , from fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , we can also observe the almost constant difference induced by the values of @xmath3 . from fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] we find that @xmath90 drops sharply as soon as @xmath4 increases from zero and then it approaches @xmath105 asymptotically , a value independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this is not difficult to explain . when the particle s angular momentum is big enough",
    ", it will hide the influence brought by the different charges .",
    "it is also verified by the potential barrier : when @xmath0 is @xmath69 and @xmath4 is large enough , the maximal potential value with different values of @xmath3 is always @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 _ the influence of _ @xmath5 : a related discussion can be found in ref .",
    "it can be revealed by tuning the value of @xmath5 with the other parameters fixed . as an example , taking @xmath108 , @xmath79 , @xmath1 , @xmath103 , we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig.7 ] , [ fig.8 ] , and table [ table4 ] that when @xmath5 increases , @xmath88 decreases and @xmath109 increases .",
    "this clearly shows that the low - lying modes are of longer relaxation time in not only the schwarzschild spacetime@xcite but also in the rn spacetime , and thus are more important for the description of the field evolution around black holes .",
    "to summarize , in this paper the quasinormal modes of the spin @xmath11 field are discussed at the presence of the reissner - nordstrom black hole .",
    "we study both the real part and the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequencies with different values of the particle charge @xmath3 , the black hole charge @xmath0 , the momentum quantum number @xmath4 , and the mode number @xmath5 .",
    "a series of conclusions have been reached , among which the most important one is that , at the stage of quasinormal ringing , when the black hole and the field have the same kind of charge ( @xmath6 ) , the quasinormal modes of the massless charged dirac field decay faster than those of the neutral ones , and when @xmath7 , the massless charged dirac field decay slower .",
    "concerning the same problem , the decay of the spin @xmath11 field around black holes , there are still a number of interesting works to be completed .",
    "one work is to consider the massive dirac field and focus on the effect of mass by comparing it with the massless field studied here .",
    "the calculation would be more complicated because the mass of the particle will appear in the dirac equation and the effective potential .",
    "but we believe that , following the method in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quasinormal frequencies of the ( massless and massive ) dirac field perturbations with the schwarzschild black hole are calculated , the massive case with charged black holes can also be worked out .",
    "one may also be interested in comparing the present results in the rn spacetime with those in some other charged black holes such as the rnads and dilaton black holes .",
    "an especially intriguing case is the kerr black hole , with non zero angular momentum . by comparing the quasinormal frequencies at the presence of non - rotating black holes and rotating black holes , like the kerr black hole@xcite",
