    "the development of high - resolution multidimensional relativistic hydrodynamic codes has provided a tool which allows to simulate the ( synchrotron ) radio emission from parsec - scale relativistic jets ( gmez et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; komissarov & falle @xcite , @xcite ; mioduszewski , hughes & duncan @xcite ) , obtaining a better understanding of the physics involved in the jets of active galactic nuclei and their enviroments .",
    "it has also been used to successfully explain the structure of particular sources ( e.g. , 3c  120 , gmez et al .",
    "1998a , b ; 3c  454.3 , gmez , marscher & alberdi @xcite ) .",
    "in this letter we study , for the first time , the radio emission properties of three - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic jet models .",
    "in particular , we focus on the observational consequences of the interaction between the relativistic jet and the surrounding medium , which leads to the development of a shear layer . such shear layers ( with distinct kinematical properties and magnetic field configuration ) appear naturally in some models of jet formation ( sol , pelletier , & asseo @xcite ) and have been invoked in the past by several authors ( komissarov @xcite , laing @xcite , laing et al .",
    "@xcite ) in order to account for a number of observational characteristics of fri radio sources . however , the physical nature of the shear layer is still largely unknown .",
    "recently , swain , bridle & baum ( @xcite ) have found evidence of shear layers in frii radio galaxies ( 3c353 ) , and attridge , roberts & wardle ( @xcite ) have inferred a two - component structure in the parsec scale jet of the source 1055 + 018 .",
    "to study the emission properties of relativistic jets we have used the high resolution three dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic jet model of aloy et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter a99 ) .",
    "the model is characterized by a beam - to - external proper rest - mass density ratio @xmath0 , a beam mach number @xmath1 , and a beam flow speed @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the speed of light ) corresponding to a beam lorentz factor of @xmath4 .",
    "non - axisymmetry was triggered by means of a helical velocity perturbation of 1% amplitude and with a period of 3.0 @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the initial beam radius ) imposed at the nozzle .",
    "we refer the reader to aloy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) where a detailed description of the hydrodynamical code can be found .",
    "the jet model is characterized by a two - component structure ( fig.[fig1 ] ) with a fast ( @xmath7 ) inner jet and a slower ( @xmath8 ) shear layer with high specific internal energy .",
    "the shear layer is defined as the region where the beam particle fraction is between 0.2 and 0.95 . as discussed in a99 ,",
    "the formation of the shear layer is dominated by the numerical viscosity inherent to the hydrodynamic code and not by the turbulent shear .",
    "inspite of this fact , the computed jet models still allow to study the physics of shear layers in relativistic jets and their observational consequences .",
    "as shown in a99 , the axial component of the momentum of the beam particles decreases by 30% within the first 60 @xmath6 .",
    "this loss of momentum causes a decrease of the lorentz factor in the inner jet with values @xmath9 5.8 , 5.3 , and 4.8 at @xmath10 25 , 50 , and 68 @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the emission properties of large scale jets in agns can be studied by computing the radio ( synchrotron ) emission from relativistic hydrodynamic jet models ( see gmez et al . @xcite,@xcite and references therein for a complete description of the model ) . for this , we assume that the particle and energy density of the non - thermal electrons is a constant fraction of the simulated thermal gas . no significant variations from this proportionality",
    "are expected to be found within the jet , since the radiative loses and particle accelerations in our model are small .",
    "the internal energy among the relativistic non - thermal electrons is distributed following a power law .",
    "the magnetic energy is set to be locally proportional and significantly smaller than the particle energy density , hence being dynamically negligible .",
    "ad hoc _ distributions of the magnetic field in the jet spine and shear layer can therefore be considered . in our model",
    "we assume that the magnetic field of the jet consists of two components . a toroidal field present both in the jet spine and the shear layer , and a second component ( in equipartition with the toroidal field ) aligned in the shear layer and radial in the jet spine",
    ". the aligned component in the shear layer could arise from the shear between the jet and the external medium , while the radial field in the jet spine may be due to transverse shocks ( i.e. , attridge , roberts & wardle @xcite ) . the resulting projected magnetic field is aligned in the shear layer and is perpendicular in the jet spine , as suggested by several observations ( laing @xcite ; swain , bridle & baum @xcite ; attridge , roberts & wardle @xcite ) .",
    "an extra randomly oriented magnetic field component ( containing 60% of the total magnetic field energy ) is assumed both for the shear layer and jet spine .",
    "the stokes parameters that determine the emission are calculated by integrating the synchrotron transfer equations along columns parallel to the line of sight accounting for the appropriate relativistic effects , such as doppler boosting and light aberration .",
    "travel time delays have been ignored assuming that the jet is stationary . since only the jet material",
    "is expected to radiate , the energy density computed with the hydro code has been weighted with the beam particle fraction .",
    "in addition , we ignore the emission from the jet cocoon and hot spot by limiting the calculations to values of the beam particle fraction larger than 0.2 and to the inner @xmath11 .",
    "because of the highly relativistic speeds in the jet , the emission is mainly determined by the observing viewing angle , @xmath12 , through the doppler factor and light aberration . figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ]",
    "show the computed emission from the hydrodynamic model of a99 corresponding to a viewing angle of 50@xmath13 and 10@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the emission is computed for an optically thin observing frequency , and spectral index of the electrons of 2.4 .",
    "for relatively large viewing angles ( fig.[fig2 ] ) the jet emission is limb brightened .",
    "this is in part due to the higher specific internal energy in the shear layer , resulting in a larger synchrotron emission coefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "the doppler factor can either enhance or cancel the limb brightening depending on the value of the viewing angle @xmath12 . because of the jet velocity stratification ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , for relatively large viewing angles the fast jet spine suffers a larger amount of dimming than the shear layer , enhancing the limb brightening . for our jet model , with a mean @xmath14 in the jet spine , this effect is maximized for @xmath15 , for which the shear layer emission is boosted while the jet spine is dimmed ( see the panel with the doppler factor in fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "cross section profiles of the jet emission at different viewing angles are plotted in fig.[fig4 ] , where the limb brightening effect can be observed more easily . for small viewing angles , as corresponding to fig.[fig3 ] ,",
    "the jet spine emission is boosted , while the shear layer emission appears dimmed .",
    "details of the jet spine can be observed , as for instance two recollimation shocks located at 26@xmath6 and 50@xmath6 .",
    "the jet emission then becomes spine brightened , instead of limb brightened , as observed in figs.[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the same arguments apply to the polarized flux . as a result of the helical field in the shear layer ,",
    "the apparent orientation of the magnetic field at the jet edges is parallel to the jet axis . for the jet spine , the toroidal and radial components of the magnetic field yield a net polarization perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "as shown in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] , for relatively large angles the aligned component of the helical magnetic field in the shear layer projects into the jet spine partially canceling its field , yielding a smaller net polarization , thereby stressing the limb brightening .",
    "rails of low polarization can be observed where the apparent magnetic field rotates between being parallel ( in the shear layer ) to being perpendicular to the jet axis , as observed in 3c  353 ( swain , bridle & baum @xcite ) .",
    "some of the kinematic and physical properties of the jet can be deduced by analyzing the jet / counter jet emission ratio , plotted in fig.[fig5 ] for the jet model of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the jet deceleration is apparent from a progressively decrease in the total flux ratio along the jet axis .",
    "the velocity stratification across the jet is also visible as a decrease of the flux ratio close to the jet edges , that is , in the shear layer .",
    "this is visible in the inner jet region , while further down the jet , when the jet spine and shear layer velocities are more similar ( due to the jet deceleration ) , the jet / counter jet flux ratio is more uniformly distributed across the jet . the slower velocity in the shear layer and its high emission coefficient result in a smaller integrated flux ratio between the jet and counter jet than for the case of a `` naked '' high velocity jet spine ( see also komissarov @xcite )",
    "this is because the shear layer emission is less affected by the viewing angle through the doppler factor .",
    "because of the helical magnetic field structure in the shear layer , an asymmetry in the emission appears across the jet .",
    "this asymmetry is more pronounced in the polarized emission , and is a function of the viewing angle , as shown in fig.[fig4 ] . in order to understand this effect",
    "we need to study the variation across the jet of the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight _ in the fluid frame _ , @xmath16 .",
    "the synchrotron radiation coefficients are a function of the sine of this angle , and asymmetries in the distribution of @xmath16 will be translated into the emission maps . in order to compute @xmath16 we need to lorentz transform the line of sight from the observer s to the fluid s frame ( see e.g. , rybicki & lightman @xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the viewing angle in the fluid frame . consider a helical magnetic field with a pitch angle @xmath19 , measured with respect to the jet axis .",
    "the angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( where superscripts @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the top and bottom of the jet , respectively ) add @xmath24 ( note that @xmath25 is always defined as positive ) .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath19 is different from zero or @xmath26 , i.e. the field is neither purely aligned nor toroidal , the factor @xmath27 in the synchrotron radiation coefficients will introduce an asymmetry in the jet emission .",
    "this asymmetry will reach a maximum value for a helical magnetic field with @xmath28 , as the one considered here .",
    "however , independently of the helix pitch angle , the predominance between @xmath29 and @xmath30 will reverse at @xmath31 , which corresponds to a viewing angle in the observer s frame of @xmath32 . for a helical field oriented clockwise as seen in the direction of flow motion ( i.e. , the aligned component of the field is parallel to the jet flow ) , and for @xmath33 the bottom of the jet will show larger emission , while for @xmath34 the top of the jet will be brighter ( the opposite is true for a helical field oriented counter - clockwise , i.e. @xmath35 ) .",
    "the maximum asymmetry will be obtained for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and the fastest transition ( with changing @xmath18 ) between top / bottom emission predominance will be obtained for @xmath19 close to @xmath26 , i.e. when little aligned field is present .    in the model we are considering",
    ", the shear layer has a mean @xmath38 , and therefore @xmath39 .",
    "smaller angles will show bottom jet dominance in emission , while for larger values the top of the jet will appear brighter .",
    "this is more clearly visible in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "note also that for the counter jet the helical field rotates opposite to the main jet , and therefore the jet asymmetry emission reverses .",
    "this is particularly well observed in the plot of the polarized emission ratio between the jet and counter jet of fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "although the @xmath40 factor affects both the total and the polarized emission , the asymmetry is more clearly present in the polarized flux ( see figs.[fig2 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is due to : i ) the presence of a randomly oriented magnetic field component , which renders the magnetic field distribution more homogeneous in the jet and diminishes the asymmetry .",
    "ii ) smaller values of @xmath16 , independently whether present at the top or the bottom of the jet , always represent a larger variation of the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight . in practice",
    "this represents a larger degree of randomness in the magnetic field along the integration columns , decreasing the net polarization .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath41 , small changes in the jet velocity or the viewing angle will produce a flip in the top / bottom jet emission dominance . for fast jets , @xmath42 will be accordingly small , and we will be biased towards observing jets with top emission predominance ( as long as the helical field rotates clockwise as seen in the direction of flow motion ) .",
    "an interpretation of the polarization observations of the blazar 1055 + 018 by attridge , roberts & wardle ( @xcite ) can be obtained in terms of the model presented here .",
    "for that , we need to assume that 1055 + 018 is oriented close to @xmath42 , and contains a shear layer with a helical field .",
    "if the helical field is oriented clockwise , the polarized emission observed at the top of the jet in inner regions would require that initially @xmath43 , or @xmath44 . to obtain the opposite situation further down the jet",
    ", @xmath18 has to become smaller than @xmath26 , and for that either @xmath12 decreases , or @xmath42 increases , which requires that @xmath45 decreases .",
    "a third less plausible possibility is that the helical field in the shear layer changes orientation , i.e. the pitch angles becomes larger that @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we can successfully explain the flip in the top / bottom orientation of the polarization asymmetry in 1055 + 018 if the jet bends towards the observer , or if it decelerates .",
    "attridge , roberts & wardle ( @xcite , and references therein ) report the existence of bends in the jet of 1055 + 018 .",
    "this supports our hypothesis , but at the location of the flip in the polarization emission asymmetry the jet spine emission decreases abruptly , contrary to what would be expected in the case of a bend towards the observer which should increase the jet spine emission by differential doppler boosting .",
    "attridge , roberts & wardle ( @xcite ) obtained significantly larger apparent velocities for components closer to the core suggesting a deceleration along the jet .",
    "therefore , this suggests our hypothesis of jet deceleration as the most plausible for the sudden change in the polarization predominance between the top and bottom of the jet in 1055 + 018 , since a jet deceleration will decrease the doppler boosting , and hence the jet spine emission as observed . a relatively small aligned field ( helical pitch angle close to @xmath26 ) will help to obtain such a fast flip in the polarization asymmetry with a relatively small jet deceleration .",
