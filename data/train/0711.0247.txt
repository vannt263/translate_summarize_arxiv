    "how do galaxies get their gas ?",
    "this important question has never been fully answered , either through observation or through numerical simulation .",
    "h@xmath5observations of the nearby universe suggest that galaxy mergers and collisions are an important aspect of this process ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) , but tidal interactions do not guarantee that the gas settles to one or other galaxy .",
    "the most spectacular interaction phenomenon is the magellanic h@xmath5  stream that trails from the lmc - smc system ( 10:1 mass ratio ) in orbit about the galaxy . since its discovery ( wannier & wrixon 1972",
    "; matthewson et al 1979 ) , there have been repeated attempts to explain the stream in terms of tidal and/or viscous forces ( q.v . mastropietro et al . 2005 ; connors , kawata & gibson 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , the stream has become a benchmark against which to judge the credibility of n - body@xmath9gas codes in explaining gas processes in galaxies .",
    "a fully consistent model of the stream continues to elude even the most sophisticated codes .    here",
    ", we demonstrate that h@xmath0  detections along the stream ( weiner & williams 1996 ; putman et al 2003 ) are providing new insights on the present state and evolution of the h@xmath5  gas . at a distance of @xmath10",
    "kpc , the expected h@xmath0  signal excited by the cosmic and galactic uv backgrounds are about 3  mr and 25  mr respectively ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 , 2002 ) , significantly lower than the mean signal of 100@xmath6200 mr , and much lower than the few bright detections in the range @xmath11 mr ( weiner , vogel & williams 2002 ) .",
    "this signal can not have a stellar origin since repeated attempts to detect stars along the stream have failed ( e.g. ostheimer , majewski & kunkel 1997 ) .    some of the stream clouds exhibit compression fronts and head - tail morphologies ( brns et al 2005 ) and this is suggestive of confinement by a tenuous external medium .",
    "but the cloud : halo density ratio ( @xmath12 ) necessary for confinement can be orders of magnitude _ larger _ than that required to achieve shock - induced h@xmath0  emission ( e.g. quilis & moore 2001 ) . indeed , the best estimates of the halo density at the distance of the stream ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ; bregman 2007 ) are far too tenuous to induce strong h@xmath0  emission at a cloud face .",
    "it is therefore surprising to discover that the brightest h@xmath0   detections lie at the leading edges of h@xmath5  clouds ( weiner  et al .",
    "2002 ) and thus appear to indicate that shock processes are somehow involved .",
    "we now present a model that goes a long way towards explaining the h@xmath0  mystery .",
    "the basic premise is that a tenuous external medium not only confines clouds , but also disrupts them with the passage of time .",
    "the growth time for kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the wavelength of the growing mode , and @xmath17 is the apparent speed of the halo medium ( @xmath18 km s@xmath2 ; see  2 ) . for cloud sizes of order a few kiloparsecs and @xmath19",
    ", the kh timescale can be much less than an orbital time ( @xmath20 gyr ) .",
    "once an upstream cloud becomes disrupted , the fragments are slowed with respect to the lmc - smc orbital speed and are subsequently ploughed into by the following clouds . in  2 , the new hydrodynamical models are described and the results are presented in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the implications of our model and suggest avenues for future research .",
    "there have been many attempts to understand how gas clouds interact with an ambient medium ( murray , white & blondin 1993 ; klein , mckee & colella 1994 ) . in order to capture the evolution of a system involving instabilities with large density gradients correctly , grid based methods ( liska & wendroff 1999 ; agertz  et al .",
    "2007 ) are favoured over other schemes ( e.g. smooth particle hydrodynamics ) .",
    "we have therefore investigated the dynamics of the magellanic stream with two independent hydrodynamics codes , _ fyris _ ( sutherland 2007 ) and _ ramses _ ( teyssier 2002 ) , that solve the equations of gas dynamics with adaptive mesh refinement .",
    "the results shown here are from the _ fyris _ code because it includes non - equilibrium ionization , but we get comparable gas evolution from either code .    the brightest emission is found along the leading edges of clouds ms  ii , iii and iv with values as high as 750 mr for ms ii .",
    "the h@xmath0  line emission is clearly resolved at @xmath21 km s@xmath2 fwhm , and shares the same radial velocity as the h@xmath5  emission within the measurement errors ( weiner et al 2002 ; g. madsen 2007 , personal communication ) .",
    "this provides an important constraint on the physical processes involved in exciting the balmer emission .    in order to explain the h@xmath0  detections along the stream",
    ", we concentrate our efforts on the disruption of the clouds labelled ms i@xmath6iv ( brns  et al .",
    "the stream is trailing the lmc - smc system in a counter - clockwise , near - polar orbit as viewed from the sun .",
    "the gas appears to extend from the lmc dislodged through tidal disruption although some contribution from drag must also be operating ( moore & davis 1994 ) .",
    "recently , the hubble space telescope has determined an orbital velocity of 378@xmath2218 km s@xmath2 for the lmc .",
    "while this is higher than earlier claims , the result has been confirmed by independent researchers ( t. pryor , personal communication ) .",
    "besla et al ( 2007 ) conclude that the origin of the stream may no longer be adequately explained with existing numerical models .",
    "the stream velocity along its orbit must be comparable to the motion of the lmc ; we adopt a value of @xmath23 km s@xmath2 .    here",
    "we employ a 3d cartesian grid with dimensions @xmath24  kpc [ @xmath25 cells ] to model a section of the stream where @xmath26 is directed along the stream arc and the @xmath27 axis points towards the observer .",
    "the grid is initially filled with two gas components .",
    "the first is a hot thin medium representing the halo corona . if we adopt a rigorously isothermal halo for the galaxy , with parameters from battaglia  et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the virial temperature at a radial distance of 55 kpc is @xmath28 k. embedded in the hot halo is ( initially ) cold h@xmath5  material with a total h@xmath5  mass of @xmath29 m@xmath8 .",
    "the cold gas has a fractal distribution and is initially confined to a cylinder with a diameter of 4 kpc and length 18 kpc ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; the mean volume and column densities are 0.02 @xmath14 and @xmath30 @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the 3d spatial power spectrum ( @xmath31 ) describes a kolmogorov turbulent medium with a minimum wavenumber @xmath32 corresponding to a spatial scale of 2.25 kpc , comparable to the size of observed clouds along the stream .",
    "a key parameter of the models is the ratio of the cloud to halo pressure , @xmath33 . if the cloud is to survive the impact of the hot halo , then @xmath34 .",
    "a shocked cloud is destroyed in about the time it takes for the internal cloud shock to cross the cloud , during which time the cool material mixes and ablates into the gas streaming past . only massive clouds with dense cores",
    "can survive the powerful shocks .",
    "an approximate lifetime for a spherical cloud of diameter @xmath35 is @xmath36 for @xmath37 in the range of 100@xmath61000 , this corresponds to 60@xmath6180 myr for individual clouds . with a view to explaining the h@xmath0  observations ,",
    "we focus our simulations on the lower end of this range .    for low @xmath37 , the density of the hot medium is @xmath38 @xmath14 .",
    "the simulations are undertaken in the frame of the cold h@xmath5  clouds , so the halo gas is given an initial transverse velocity of 350@xmath39 .",
    "the observations reveal that the mean h@xmath0  emission has a slow trend along the stream which requires the stream to move through the halo at a small angle of attack ( 20@xmath40 ) in the plane of the sky ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . thus , the velocity of the hot gas as seen by the stream is @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43@xmath39 .",
    "the adiabatic sound speed of the halo gas is 200@xmath39 , such that the drift velocity is mildly supersonic ( transsonic ) , with a mach number of 1.75 .",
    "a unique feature of the _ fyris _ simulations is that they include non - equilibrium cooling through time - dependent ionisation calculations ( cf .",
    "rosen & smith 2004 ) .",
    "when shocks occur within the inviscid fluid , the jump shock conditions are solved across the discontinuity .",
    "this allows us to calculate the balmer emission produced in shocks and additionally from turbulent mixing along the stream ( e.g. slavin  et al .",
    "we adopt a conservative value for the gas metallicity of [ fe / h]=-1.0 ( cf .",
    "gibson  et al .  2000 ) ; a higher value accentuates the cooling and results in denser gas , and therefore stronger h@xmath0  emission along the stream .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in figs .",
    "@xmath44 ; we provide animations of the disrupting stream at http://www.aao.gov.au/astro/ms . in our model ,",
    "the fractal stream experiences a  hot wind \" moving in the opposite direction .",
    "the sides of the stream clouds are subject to gas ablation via kh instabilities due to the reduced pressure ( bernouilli s theorem ) .",
    "the ablated gas is slowed dramatically by the hot wind and is transported behind the cloud . as higher order modes grow , the fundamental mode associated with the cloud size will eventually fragment it .",
    "the ablated gas now plays the role of a  cool wind \" that is swept up by the pursuing clouds leading to shock ionization and ablation of the downstream clouds .",
    "the newly ablated material continues the trend along the length of the stream .",
    "the pursuing gas cloud transfers momentum to the ablated upstream gas and accelerates it ; this results in rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities , especially at the stagnation point in the front of the cloud .",
    "we rapidly approach a nonlinear regime where the kh and rt instabilities become strongly entangled , and the internal motions become highly turbulent .",
    "the simulations track the progression of the shock fronts as they propagate into the cloudlets .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the predicted conversion of neutral to ionized hydrogen due largely to cascading shocks along the stream .",
    "the drift of the peak to higher columns is due to the shocks eroding away the outer layers , thereby progressing into increasingly dense cloud cores .",
    "the ablated gas drives a shock into the h@xmath5  material with a shock speed of @xmath45 measured in the cloud frame . at the shock interface ,",
    "once ram - pressure equilibrium is reached , we find @xmath46 . in order to produce significant h@xmath0  emission , @xmath47@xmath39  such that @xmath48 . in fig .  3",
    ", we see the steady rise in h@xmath0  emission along the stream , reaching @xmath49 mr after 120  myr , and the most extreme observed values after 170  myr .",
    "the power - law decline to bright emission measures is a direct consequence of the shock cascade .",
    "the shock - induced ionization rate is @xmath50 phot s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 .",
    "the predicted luminosity - weighted line widths of 20@xmath39  fwhm ( fig .",
    "3 , inset ) are consistent with the h@xmath0  kinematics . in fig .",
    "4 , the h@xmath0  emission is superimposed onto the projected h@xmath5  emission : much of it lies at the leading edges of clouds , although there are occasional cloudlets where ionized gas dominates over the neutral column .",
    "some of the brightest emission peaks appear to be due to limb brightening , while others arise from chance alignments .",
    "the simulations track the degree of turbulent mixing between the hot and cool media brought on by kh instabilities ( e.g. kahn 1980 ) .",
    "the turbulent layer grows as the flow develops , mixing up hot and cool gas at a characteristic temperature of about 10@xmath7k . in certain situations ,",
    "a sizeable h@xmath0  luminosity can be generated ( e.g. canto & raga 1991 ) and the expected line widths are comparable to those observed in the stream (  2 ) . indeed , the simulations reveal that the fractal clouds develop a warm ionized skin along the entire length of the stream .",
    "but the characteristic h@xmath0  emission ( denoted by the shifting peak in fig .",
    "3 ) is comparable to the fluorescence excited by the galactic uv field ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 2002 ) .",
    "we note with interest that narrow balmer lines can arise from pre - cursor shocks ( e.g. heng & mccray 2007 ) , but these require conditions that are unlikely to be operating along the stream .",
    "we have seen that the brightest h@xmath0  emission along the stream can be understood in terms of shock ionization and heating in a transsonic ( low mach number ) flow .",
    "for the first time , the balmer emission ( and associated emission lines ) provides diagnostic information at any position along the stream that is independent of the h@xmath5   observations .",
    "slow balmer - dominated shocks of this kind ( e.g. chevalier & raymond 1978 ) produce partially ionized media where a significant fraction of the h@xmath0  emission is due to collisional excitation .",
    "this can lead to balmer decrements ( h@xmath0/h@xmath51  ratio ) in excess of 4 , i.e. significantly enhanced over the pure recombination ratio of about 3 , that will be fairly straightforward to verify in the brightest regions of the stream .",
    "the shock models predict a range of low - ionization emission lines ( e.g. oi , sii ) , some of which will be detectable even though suppressed by the low gas - phase metallicity .",
    "there are likely to be euv absorption - line diagnostics through the shock interfaces revealing more extreme kinematics ( fig .",
    "3 , inset ) , but these detections ( e.g. ovi ) are only possible towards fortuitous background sources ( sembach  et al .  2001 ; bregman 2007 ) .",
    "the predicted euv / x - ray emissivity from the post - shock regions is much too low to be detected in emission .",
    "the characteristic timescale for large changes is roughly 100@xmath6200 myr , and so the stream needs to be replenished by the outer disk of the lmc at a fairly constant rate ( e.g. mastropietro  et al .",
    "the timescale can be extended with larger @xmath37 values ( see equation ( 1 ) ) , but at the expense of substantially diminished h@xmath0  surface brightness . in this respect , we consider @xmath37 to be fairly well bounded by observation and theory .    what happens to the gas shedded from the dense clouds ?",
    "much of the diffuse gas will become mixed with the hot halo gas suggesting a warm accretion towards the inner galactic halo . if most of the stream gas enters the galaxy via this process , the derived gas accretion rate is @xmath52m@xmath8  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the higher value compared to h@xmath5  ( e.g. peek  et al .",
    "2007 ) is due to the gas already shredded , not seen by radio telescopes now . in our model ,",
    "the hvcs observed today are unlikely to have been dislodged from the stream by the process described here .",
    "these may have come from an earlier stage of the lmc - smc interaction with the outer disk of the galaxy .",
    "the `` shock cascade '' interpretation for the stream clears up a nagging uncertainty about the h@xmath0  distance scale for high - velocity clouds .",
    "bland - hawthorn et al ( 1998 ) first showed that distance limits to hvcs can be determined from their observed h@xmath0  strength due to ionization by the galactic radiation field , now confirmed by clouds with reliable distance brackets from the stellar absorption line technique ( wakker 2001 ) .",
    "hvcs have smaller kinetic energies compared to the stream clouds , and their interactions with the halo gas are not expected to produce significant shock - induced or mixing layer h@xmath0  emission , thereby supporting the use of h@xmath0  as a crude distance indicator .    here ,",
    "we have not attempted to reproduce the h@xmath5  observations of the stream in detail .",
    "this is left to a subsequent paper where we explore a larger parameter space and include a more detailed comparison with the h@xmath5  and h@xmath0  power spectrum , inter alia .",
    "we introduce additional physics , in particular , the rotation of the hot halo , a range of stream orbits through the halo gas , the gravitational field of the galaxy , and so on .",
    "if we are to arrive at a satisfactory understanding of the stream interaction with the halo , future deep h@xmath0  surveys will be essential .",
    "it is plausible that current h@xmath0  observations are still missing a substantial amount of gas , in contrast to the deepest h@xmath5  observations .",
    "we can compare the particle column density inferred from h@xmath5  and h@xmath0  imaging surveys .",
    "the limiting h@xmath5  column density is about @xmath53 @xmath1 where @xmath54 is the mean atomic hydrogen density , and @xmath55 is the depth through the slab . by comparison , the h@xmath0   surface brightness can be expressed as an equivalent emission measure , @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are the local and column electron density .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath59 in h@xmath0  imaging is about 100 mr , and therefore @xmath60 @xmath1 .",
    "whether the ionized and neutral gas are mixed or distinct , we can hide a lot more ionized gas below the imaging threshold for a fixed @xmath55 , particularly if the gas is at low density ( @xmath61 @xmath14 ) .",
    "a small or variable volume filling factor can complicate this picture but , in general , the ionized gas still wins out because of ionization of low density h@xmath5  by the cosmic uv background ( maloney 1993 ) . in summary , even within the constraints of the cosmic microwave background ( see maloney & bland - hawthorn 1999 ) , a substantial fraction of the gas can be missed if it occupies a large volume in the form of a low density plasma .",
