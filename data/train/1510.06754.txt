    "<S> the most common known gauge theory is classical electrodynamics which is described by maxwell s equations . in quantum mechanics the simplest but non trivial setting is a charged quantum particle moving in a classical externally prescribed electromagnetic background field giving rise to phenomena like the aharonov - bohm effect . </S>",
    "<S> field theories such as quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) are gauge theories where the gauge fields are dynamical in their own right and which interact with the matter fields , thereby mediating interactions among the matter particles . </S>",

    "<S> these proposals include the generation of abelian as well as non - abelian gauge fields realized with ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite or with superconducting circuits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these settings can be viewed as a powerful tool for the quantum simulation of dynamical gauge theories such as qed and qcd on a lattice  @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we study the most basic phonon - assisted photon tunneling process which is due to the optomechanical interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the coupled photon - phonon dynamics and we show that in the optomechanical setting , phonons can act as a _ dynamical _ gauge field for photons . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , in the optomechanical setting , these dynamical gauge fields arise in quite a natural manner .    in general , </S>",
    "<S> optomechanics describes the interaction of light and mechanical motion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the prototypical optomechanical setting consists in a fabry - prot cavity where one of the mirrors is free to oscillate . due to the radiation pressure force the light inside the cavity interacts with the mirror s motion . </S>",
    "<S> tremendous experimental progress has been made during the last years , with achievements such as cooling a nanomechanical oscillator to its motional ground state  @xcite and position measurements below the standard quantum limit  @xcite , to name only a few examples . mechanically and/or optically coupling several optomechanical systems </S>",
    "<S> leads to interesting new physics . </S>",

    "<S> recently , it has been shown that optomechanical arrays also allow for the generation of artificial gauge fields for photons  @xcite and phonons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the optomechanical implementation complements other proposals for generating artificial gauge fields for photons  @xcite and ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .    as mentioned , _ </S>",
    "<S> static _ gauge fields for photons can also be realized using a variety of other methods , even though they are not necessarily as tunable as the optomechanical approach . in this article , however , we want to exploit a unique aspect of the optomechanical case that is not present in any of the other approaches that are based on geometry or externally applied periodic modulation . </S>",
    "<S> this is the fact that the mechanical vibrations ( which generate the artificial gauge field ) have oscillation phases that can evolve in response to the light field dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our aim is to promote the static gauge fields to become dynamical gauge fields and investigate back - action effects of the dynamical gauge field on the hopping photons in the intriguing driven and dissipative setting of an optomechanical array . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a simple model which gives rise to acoustical dynamical gauge fields for optical `` matter '' fields . to be more precise , we consider a photonic lattice ( representing the matter fields ) and artificial gauge fields ( phonons ) which can be attributed to directed links between two sites of the photonic lattice . </S>",

    "<S> * _ model. _ * the crucial ingredient in our model is the phonon - assisted photon tunneling that can be generated by the optomechanical interaction : a photon @xmath2 in a lattice hopping from site to site is accompanied by the coherent emission or absorption of a phonon @xmath0 . for a photon tunneling between sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 , this is described by @xmath5 ( and the opposite process ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a setting can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 we set @xmath7 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4 denotes a lattice site , and @xmath8 is the index for a _ directed _ link from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> when a photon hops in the direction of the link , it absorbs a phonon . </S>",
    "<S> photons ( phonons ) have frequencies @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 are the coupling constants for the phonon - assisted photon tunneling process . for later use , we introduce the notation @xmath14 and note that we use @xmath15 and @xmath16 interchangeably . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) we made use of the rotating wave approximation which is valid for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the photon decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> as pointed out previously  @xcite , non - reciprocity in photon transport can be engineered by introducing coherent inelastic transitions induced by mechanical vibrations . however , in contrast to ref .  @xcite we will treat the vibrations as dynamical degrees of freedom , as explained below . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the details of the scheme , in order to make the inelastic processes resonant we need to ensure that the nearest neighbor on - site photon frequencies @xmath11 differ by the corresponding link phonon frequency @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 , with the link direction from site @xmath3 to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to _ directed _ links . </S>",
    "<S> generally , a photon tunneling from a site with a low ( high ) on - site frequency to a site with a high ( low ) on - site frequency absorbs ( emits ) a phonon . </S>",
    "<S> since the photons will eventually decay , we include the effects of dissipation and driving of the photons by adding a driving term @xmath21 to the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) and by including dissipation of the photons at a rate @xmath18 ( for details we refer to the supplemental material  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this effective model can be realized in an optomechanical setting by building on the `` modulated link '' scheme that had been proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to generate _ </S>",
    "<S> static _ artificial magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly review this scheme for one of the links of the optomechanical setup depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : om_schematics ] b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we explain why such a modulated link reduces to the link of the effective model of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) , cf .  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : om_schematics ] a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the link between two optical modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 is realized with an intermediate optical mode @xmath22 which couples optomechanically to a mechanical mode @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the link forms a single optomechanical cell . in the original `` modulated link '' </S>",
    "<S> scheme  @xcite the mechanical mode is externally driven into a large amplitude state @xmath24 which leads to a modulation of the frequency of the intermediate optical mode @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the single - photon optomechanical coupling strength . however , in contrast to  @xcite , we will here assume the mechanical oscillator to be undergoing self - sustained optomechanical oscillations  @xcite instead of being externally driven . </S>",
    "<S> thus it behaves as a limit - cycle oscillator with a fixed amplitude @xmath27 and a free phase @xmath28 . in any case , in order to enable a photon to tunnel along such a link , the mechanical frequency has to match the difference of optical frequencies , as explained above . </S>",
    "<S> we note that other microscopic implementations are possible . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one might have a mechanical mode that directly couples to the hopping between optical modes , as has been worked out in detail for optomechanical crystals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would be connected to the `` wavelength conversion scheme '' discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> * _ gauge field dynamcis. _ * the corresponding equations of motion for the effective hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) for the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be obtained using heisenberg s equations of motion . here </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the classical dynamics of the model , i.e. , the limit of large coherent photon and phonon amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most relevant regime for most of the current optomechanical setups ( due to the small single - photon coupling strength @xmath26 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we decompose the expectation values of the photon and phonon operators into a classical amplitude and a phase , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . from the full quantum heisenberg equations of motion , </S>",
    "<S> the equations for the mechanical phases @xmath33 become @xmath34 where the link direction is from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , while the optical amplitudes @xmath35 obey the following equations of motion @xmath36 and the optical phases @xmath37 evolve according to @xmath38 here and in the following we assume that the amplitudes of the limit - cycle oscillations @xmath39 are a constant of motion , i.e. , @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this regime can be reached by working with self - induced optomechanical oscillators ( pumped by a blue - detuned laser ) sufficiently above threshold  @xcite . furthermore , we introduced @xmath41 and used @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> an important point we want to make at this stage is the invariance of the equations of motion under the following _ local _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 gauge transformation @xmath44 meaning that the observed evolution of the light _ </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eqn : g1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : g2 ] ) would have to be supplemented by a change in frequencies : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now ask under which conditions the gauge field will display nontrivial dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the time occurring in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : eqm1 ] ) ,  ( [ eqn : eqm2 ] ) , and  ( [ eqn : eqm3 ] ) can be rescaled by @xmath49 . after doing this </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that the entire dynamics only depends on the dimensionless ratio of @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is proportional to the laser drive amplitude ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the limit @xmath52 , we expect that the oscillation phases ( i.e. , the magnetic field ) will not be affected by the hopping photons , rather only defining a static magnetic field pattern . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : eqm1 ] ) : for @xmath53 the second term , which provides the coupling to the hopping photons , can be neglected . however , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath50 is large , we expect back - action of the hopping photons on the phonons leading to intriguing coupled dynamics of the gauge field .    </S>",
    "<S> * _ three - site model. _ * first , we will study the case of three sites . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective model for photons @xmath29 on sites @xmath54 and phonons @xmath15 on links @xmath55 is depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> note that for three sites we define @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> for definiteness , we will assume @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> for the present three - site model , the gauge freedom implies that only the gauge invariant flux @xmath58 i.e. , the sum of phases around the triangular plaquette , affects the dynamics of the photons . </S>",
    "<S> we want to mention that in the regime where the phonons are not influenced by the photons ( @xmath53 and consequently @xmath59 ) the hamiltonian for the three - site model can be diagonalized and the setup can act ( for @xmath60 ) as a photon circulator  @xcite . in the following we turn to the intriguing case where the photons interact with the phonons which produces a dynamical gauge field . here </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the driven and dissipative setting and furthermore choose equal tunneling amplitudes @xmath61 and mechanical amplitudes @xmath62 . in the following we consider an example with a resonant drive on site @xmath63 only , i.e. , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> as pointed out above , without drive and dissipation the dynamics only depends on the ratio @xmath50 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the four parameters involved here , for the driven case @xmath67 , can be combined into just two dimensionless parameters , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] a ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig : fig2 ] b ) and c ) show cuts along the red dashed lines marked in the phase diagram . </S>",

    "<S> a more involved characterization can be done with the help of a bifurcation diagram . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we show the value of the flux @xmath70 evaluated at the zero crossings of @xmath73 , in the long - time limit , as a function the mechanical amplitude @xmath27 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] f ) . </S>",
    "<S> this bifurcation diagram allows us to distinguish the periodic [ region iii in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> analytical progress can be made in the limit where the photon dynamics is much faster than the phonon dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we are then able to apply a born - oppenheimer approximation and adiabatically eliminate the photons . </S>",
    "<S> to be more precise , we solve @xmath74 where @xmath75 a_{j } - i e_{j } - i j b \\sum_{k \\neq j } e^{-i\\phi_{jk } } a_{k } \\ , , { \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and use this instantaneous solution to eliminate @xmath76 from the equations of motion for the mechanical phases @xmath33 ( for details we refer to the supplemental material  @xcite ) . in the case of a resonant ( @xmath66 ) drive on site @xmath63 , this approximation leads to the following equation of motion for the flux : @xmath77^{2 } + [ 16 \\cos(\\phi)]^{2 } } \\label{eqn : dp } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : dp ] ) we find @xmath71 which shows very good agreement with the exact numerical long - time dynamics in regime i. this approach fails to reproduce the flux dynamics @xmath70 in the other two regimes since there we are not able to adiabatically eliminate the photons . </S>",
    "<S> we also want to mention that both @xmath78 and @xmath79 are fixed points of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> going from three sites to a lattice , a significant new feature comes into play : the artificial dynamical magnetic field produced by the phonons can now exert a lorentz force that bends the path of any light - beam propagating in the two - dimensional array . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we end up with a dynamical interplay where the flow of the photons changes the spatial distribution of the magnetic flux density which then acts back on the dynamics of the light field . in the following we assume equal mechanical amplitudes @xmath84 and tunneling amplitudes @xmath85 . </S>",
