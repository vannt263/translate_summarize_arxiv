    "quantum computation has developed as an exciting field of research in the last decade and it has generated wide interest among scientists and engineers .",
    "it offers the opportunity of creation of algorithms that are radically different and more efficient as compared to their classical counterparts .",
    "shor s prime factorization algorithm  @xcite and grover s quantum search algorithm  @xcite have theoretically demonstrated the power of quantum algorithms . however , the experimental implementation of the quantum algorithms is still quite challenging .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) has been the vanguard among the presently available techniques for physical implementation of quantum algorithms  @xcite . till date",
    ", the algorithms have been tested on systems with a small number of qubits with a presumption that once a quantum computer with large number of qubits are made , more real world application of the algorithms can be implemented .",
    "implementation of the quantum algorithms on very large system requires the application of a large number of unitary operators .",
    "as any physical implementation involves some amount of error which accrue when the unitary operators are applied in tandem , physical implementation of an algorithm in a large system becomes difficult .",
    "the sensitivity of the algorithm to small errors can lead to it s failure .",
    "grover s quantum search algorithm , or more generally the quantum amplitude amplification algorithm , is designed to search a marked item from an unsorted database  @xcite .",
    "it drives a quantum computer from a prepared initial state @xmath0 to a desired target state @xmath1 , which encodes the marked item .",
    "generally , @xmath0 is prepared by applying a unitary operator @xmath2 on a particular basis state @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 . the heart of the algorithm is the grover s iteration operator @xmath5 given by @xmath6 thus @xmath7 is the selective phase inversion of the state @xmath8 . if @xmath9 then @xmath10 times iteration of @xmath5 on @xmath0 yield the target state @xmath1 with a high probability . for searching a database of @xmath11 items , the initial state @xmath0 is chosen to be the equal superposition of all basis states each of which has a probability amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "it is generated by applying the walsh - hadamard transform @xmath13 on the basis state @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath14 . since @xmath1 is a unique basis state , @xmath15 and @xmath16 times iterations of @xmath17 on @xmath0 yield the target state @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case when the implementation errors cause the deviations in selective phase inversions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in other words , we want the apparatus to implement @xmath20 but due to errors , the apparatus implements @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the selective phase rotation of @xmath8 by angle @xmath23 .",
    "then the grover s operator becomes @xmath24 and the well - known _ phase - matching _",
    "condition  @xcite demands @xmath25 for grover s algorithm to succeed . for large database size , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and",
    "the above condition becomes quite stringent . from the implementation point of view , satisfying eq .",
    "[ phcon ] is tough as the phase rotations on state @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not equal in general .",
    "therefore , as the size of the database increases , there is a high risk that grover s algorithm fails even if there are very small errors in the implementation of the operators .    to take into account the above mentioned problem",
    ", tulsi has modified the quantum search algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on the assumption that errors are ( i ) reproducible and ( ii ) reversible .",
    "the reproducibility allows us to implement the transformations @xmath21 at our disposal while the reversibility allows us to implement the inverse transformations @xmath30 at our disposal .",
    "then the collective effect of the errors can be cancelled by iterating the following operator @xmath31 note that for @xmath32 , @xmath33 is just two steps of grover s algorithm , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "tulsi has shown that @xmath35 times iteration of @xmath33 on @xmath0 yield the target state @xmath1 with high probability . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath36 is small ( i.e. the database is large ) , small difference between @xmath37 and @xmath38 can cause the grover s algorithm to fail while the modified algorithm still succeeds in finding the target state ( see fig .",
    "[ simu ] for simulation results ) .",
    "however it may be pointed out that grover s algorithm is self correcting if @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ simu1 ] ) .",
    "the complexity of both the algorithms remains almost the same for @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that for the experimental demonstration of the difference between the original and the modified search algorithm for large database , it is not necessary to implement them on a very large system .",
    "we can simulate the behaviour of the algorithms for large database by preparing a small system with @xmath41 , i.e. initially , the target state has a low probability amplitude . as there are no other restrictions on the size of system ,",
    "a two qubit system is suitable enough for this purpose .",
    "+      to experimentally verify the algorithm of tulsi @xcite , the original and the modified search algorithms are implemented here in an nmr quantum information processor .",
    "the implementation procedure consists of ( i ) preparation of the pseudo - pure state ( pps ) , ( ii ) preparation of the superposition of all the states such that the marked state has a low probability amplitude , ( iii ) application of the original / modified iterations and finally ( iv ) measurement .",
    "the experiment has been carried out at room temperature in 11.7 tesla field in a bruker av500 spectrometer using a qxi probe .",
    "the system chosen for the implementation of the algorithm is carbon-13 labeled chloroform ( @xmath42chcl@xmath43 ) , where @xmath44h and @xmath42c act as the two qubits .",
    "the @xmath44h and @xmath42c resonance frequencies at this field are 500 mhz and 125 mhz respectively and the scalar coupling between the spins is j@xmath45= 209 hz . the nmr hamiltonian for a 2-qubit weakly coupled spin system is @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the larmour frequencies and the j@xmath48 is the scalar coupling . the equillibrium density matrix , which is the starting point of any algorithm in nmr quantum information processor , under high temperature and high field approximation is in a highly mixed state represented by @xcite , @xmath49 where the @xmath50 is 1:0.25 are the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclei .",
    "we describe the various stages of the experimental implementation in the following paragraphs .",
    "+    for a two - qubit system , there are @xmath51 basis states : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we choose the target state to be @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath0 is an equal superposition of the basis states then @xmath56 . but to simulate the grover s algorithm for large database , we want @xmath36 to be small . that we achieve by letting @xmath0 to be an unequal superposition .",
    "we first create the @xmath57 pps by the use of spatial averaging @xcite,[fig .",
    "[ pseq ] ] .",
    "a @xmath57 pps has a unit population in the @xmath57 state and zero population in @xmath58 and @xmath59 states .",
    "then we apply a @xmath60 pulse on it .",
    "we have @xmath61.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath62 .",
    "by choosing @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we achieve @xmath65 respectively .",
    "just to compare , if @xmath0 is an equal superposition of @xmath11 basis states then @xmath15 and these values of @xmath36 correspond to @xmath66 respectively so that we need @xmath67 qubits respectively to represent all basis states .",
    "however , by choosing @xmath0 to be an unequal superposition , a two - qubit system becomes sufficient to simulate large databases .",
    "the next step in the implementation of the algorithms is the application of the @xmath68 operator . in our case",
    ", we assume that there are no errors in @xmath19 trasnformation , i.e. @xmath69 . since @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 note that in case of no errors in @xmath73 transformation , we have @xmath74 . fig .",
    "[ pseq ] contains the pulse programme for the implementation of the @xmath33 operator .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath76 operators are selective phase rotations of @xmath57 and @xmath59 states respectively i.e. @xmath77 therefore in nmr , the @xmath75 and @xmath76 operators are implemented by evolution under @xmath78 respectively .",
    "following @xcite , for @xmath75 , the evolution under @xmath79 and @xmath80 are implemented by composite z - rotation pulses like @xmath81_{y}\\left[\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right]_{\\bar{x}}\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]_{\\bar{y}}$ ] .",
    "the evolution under the @xmath82 is implemented by evolving the system under the scalar coupling hamiltonian only , for a time period of @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath84 operator is applied by ( a ) reversing the order of application of pulses and evolution , ( b ) flipping the phase of the centre pulse of the composite z rotation by @xmath85 and ( c ) changing the evolution time from @xmath83 to @xmath86 for @xmath84 .",
    "the application of @xmath76 involves evolution of the system under the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "this is similar to the hamiltonian evolution for @xmath75 , the only difference being the negative sign before @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this implies that the phase of the centre pulse in the composite z rotation is changed by @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , as errors are not introduced in the @xmath76 operator ( i.e. @xmath69 ) , the central pulse in the composite z rotation has a flip angle of @xmath87 and the time of evolution is 1/2j in both the cases of implementation .",
    "+ after the implementation of the algorithm , the final state is measured . in this case",
    "only the diagonal elements of the final density matrix ( population spectra ) is required to be measured .",
    "this is done by collecting the data after applying a gradient to kill the off - diagonal elements followed by a 90@xmath88 pulse .",
    "the diagonal elements of the final density matrix are reconstructed from the population spectrum .",
    "+      fourteen iterations of the original and the modified algorithms were implemented for three different values of initial probability amplitude of the marked state i.e. @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "for the case @xmath89 , no error has been introduced in @xmath73 operator ( i.e. @xmath74 ) which implies that the phase matching condition is satisfied in this case .",
    "it can be seen that both ` original ' and ` modified ' algorithm behaves almost similarly i.e. they find the marked state with almost the same periodicity ( fig .",
    "[ f3a ] ) . in the next case ( fig .",
    "[ f3b ] ) , the value of @xmath90 as chosen to be @xmath91 to make @xmath36 smaller and an error of 10@xmath92 was introduced in @xmath73 ( i.e. @xmath93 ) so that the phase matching condition is violated .",
    "we see that in this case , the original search algorithms starts to fail while the ` modified ' algorithm obtains the searched state with a high probability ( @xmath94 80 @xmath92 ) .",
    "the original algorithm can not amplify the amplitude of the marked state so as to definitely distinguish it and therefore the solution is not reached .",
    "finally , the algorithms were implemented for @xmath95 and 10@xmath92 error in @xmath73 operator ( fig .",
    "[ f3c ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath36 is very small ( simulating a system of about 10 qubits ) , and therefore the ` _ phase matching _ '",
    "condition is violated even more strongly .",
    "it can be seen that in this case , the ` original ' algorithms totally fails in reaching the solution but the ` modified ' algorithm succeeds . for completeness , the diagonal elements of the tomographed density matrix for the case of fig .",
    "[ f3c ] i.e. @xmath95 and 10@xmath92 error in @xmath73 are plotted in fig 4 .",
    "this confirms the success of the ` modified ' algorithm of tulsi @xcite .",
    "+    in conclusion , we have implemented the ` modified ' quantum search algorithm by tulsi @xcite and have experimentally validated his claim that his algorithm is robust to errors in @xmath96 operator as compared to the original search algorithm .",
    "we have shown that small errors can be fatal for searching larger databases using grover s algorithm while the ` modified ' search algorithm is robust .",
    "we have experimentally simulated the behaviour of the algorithms in large database on a 2-qubit nmr quantum information processor .",
    "quantum computers when fully operational will be dealing with real world problems requiring large systems .",
    "this experiment , besides providing a validation for an important theoretical prediction , will help in providing impetus to future work on the study of existing algorithms in large real world systems .",
