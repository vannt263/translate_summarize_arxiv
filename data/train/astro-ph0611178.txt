    "measurements of large scale galaxy clustering place important constraints on cosmological parameters that complement those from the analysis of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "measurments of the galaxy power spectrum from sdss @xcite and 2dfgrs @xcite constrain the parameter combinations @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the constraint on @xmath1 is particularly important as , for instance , it breaks a degeneracy in the cmb data and allows accurate determination of @xmath3 .",
    "hence to be sure that systematic errors are not biasing the parameters it is very useful to have independent estimates from different surveys .",
    "however when one looks at the constraints coming from the published 2dfgrs and sdss analysis one finds a tension . in figure  16a of @xcite , which compares the published estimates of the galaxy power spectra , there is evidence of more large scale power in the 2dfgrs than in sdss .",
    "this folds through and results in the headline value of @xmath4 from 2dfgrs @xcite being lower than that of @xcite sdss , @xmath5 . here",
    "one should be cautious as different priors have been assumed , but in the analysis of @xcite , which treats each data set on an equal footing and separatley combines each with cmb data , one sees in their figure  18 that the sdss prefers a substantially higher value of @xmath3 than does the 2dfgrs .",
    "in fact , while the 2dfgrs estimate is in good agreement with that from the cmb data alone ( it significantly tightens the constraint without shifting the best fitting value ) the sdss data pull @xmath3 to higher values than preferred by the cmb .    here",
    "we seek to investigate whether these differences are as a result of : a )  larger than expected cosmic variance , b )  systematics due to differences in the analysis technique ( cole et al .",
    "use simple fourier methods in redshift space , while tegmark et al . use the apparatus of kl decomposition and work in real space ) , c )  systematics due to problems with galaxy catalogues or d ) intrinsic differences in the underlying galaxy clustering . in order to directly compare the 2dfgrs and sdss",
    ", we analyse each dataset using essentially identical methods which we outline in section  [ sec : method ] in section  [ sec : results ] we briefly look at the region of overlap between the surveys and then compare the resulting power spectra from the full catalogues and interpret the differences .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ]",
    "our method of estimating the galaxy power spectrum , determining statistical errors and fitting models is essentially identical to that set out in @xcite , but with three minor changes . in brief :    * we use masks , whose construction is described in @xcite , to describe the angular variation of the survey magnitude limit , redshift completeness and magnitude dependence of the redshift completeness . * random catalogues are generated by sampling from the luminosity function and viewing through the masks . to generate random catalogues corresponding to red / blue subsets , the luminosity function of only the red / blue galaxies is used . * close pair incompleteness due to `` fibre collisions ''",
    "is dealt with by redistributing the weights of missed galaxies to their 10 nearest neighbours on the sky . *",
    "the power spectrum is estimated using a simple cubic fft method with the optimal weighting scheme of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pvp ) and then spherically averaged in redshift space .",
    "the assumed linear empirical bias factors that are used in this weighting scheme are @xmath6 * the covariance matrix describing the errors on the power spectrum measurements and their correlations is estimated using mock catalogues which are constructed from the random catalogues by generating a log - normal density field with a specified power spectrum and using it to modulate the selection of galaxies from the random catalogue .",
    "thus , by construction , these catalogues have a power spectrum very close to the best fitting model and have luminosity and colour dependent clustering consistent with the bias factors of equation  ( [ eqn : bias ] ) .",
    "* the survey window function is determined directly from the random catalogue .",
    "when fitting models the theoretical model power spectra are convolved with the survey window function .",
    "the three minor changes we have made are :    * we have changed the binning scheme so that now @xmath7 is estimated in bins uniformly spaced in @xmath8 , rather than the linearly space bins with different bin widths in different ranges of @xmath9 that were used in @xcite .",
    "* we used new sets of log - normal catalogues in which the modulation of the density field used for galaxies with different bias factors is linear rather than the slightly more complicated scheme that was employed by @xcite .",
    "* power spectra fits are done using cosmo - mc @xcite as in @xcite which uses camb to estimate of @xmath7 rather than the @xcite fitting formula .",
    "( we have found the use of the approximate @xcite fitting formula causes a small shift in @xmath1 . )      in most respects our analysis of the sdss is identical to that of the 2dfgrs .",
    "the only differences are a simpler way of generating the survey masks and of populating the corresponding random catalogue .",
    "the sky coverage mask we have adopted for the sdss - dr5 data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mask ] and compared with corresponding 2dfgrs mask .",
    "we constructed this mask by simply noting the angular coverage of each of the stripes from which the sdss survey is built and by removing a few small regions with poor coverage .",
    "most of the sdss survey goes to a uniform magnitude limit of @xmath10 , but a sub - area , which is easily identified using the target selection date , has a variety of different magnitude limits . in this sub - area",
    "we simply imposed a fixed magnitude limit of @xmath11 and discarded all galaxies fainter than this limit .",
    "the number of galaxies with redshifts that are retained by the mask and magnitude limits and used in our analysis is @xmath12 .",
    "the mask is cruder than the more sophisticated ones employed by @xcite and for the 2dfgrs as it ignores the smaller scale variation in the redshift completeness .",
    "however in the case of the 2dfgrs , where the incompleteness variation is much larger , we showed that provided this incompleteness is accounted for using our method of redistributing of the weights of galaxies without redshifts to neighbours with redshifts the resulting power spectrum estimates are very accurate ( see figure  17 g of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as most of the catalogue goes uniformly to the deeper magnitude limit a simple method can be used to construct the random catalogue .",
    "[ fig : dndz ] shows the redshift distribution of this sample together with an analytic fit that smoothes away the effect of large scale clustering .",
    "our procedure is :    1 .",
    "select a random direction on the sky .",
    "2 .   choose at random a genuine galaxy from the region of the survey that goes to @xmath10 .",
    "3 .   keep the galaxy with a probability proportional to the ratio of the height of redshift histogram to that of the scaled fit shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz ] at the redshift of the selected galaxy .",
    "4 .   keep or discard the galaxy based on the sky coverage and magnitude limit of the mask .",
    "( note , for galaxies that fall where the magnitude limit is only @xmath13 , the fainter galaxies will be discarded and the redshift distribution of the retained galaxies will be appropriately shallower than that of fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz ] . )",
    "these steps are done repeatedly until a random catalogue containing @xmath14 times more galaxies than the genuine catalogue is built up .",
    "selecting from the genuine catalogue in this way means we automatically have apparent magnitudes and colours for all the galaxies in the random catalogue and so can select sub - samples from it and weight its galaxies in just the same way as the genuine catalogue .    to utilize the @xcite optimum weighting we need to determine bias factors for the galaxies in the genuine , random and mock catalogues",
    "we do this by first converting the sdss magnitudes to the 2dfgrs @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands using @xmath17 and the simple colour dependent @xmath9-corrections that were used for the 2dfgrs data ( see section  3 of * ? ? ?",
    ". then we are able to define the bias factors using equation  ( [ eqn : bias ] ) just as for the 2dfgrs data .",
    "our main focus is the comparison of the power spectra of the two surveys , but we first directly compare the two surveys in the region of their overlap to get a feel for the different selections used and the level of incompleteness .      in the northern galactic hemisphere there is a contiguous area of overlap between the two surveys , which runs for @xmath18  degrees of ra and is for the most part @xmath19  degrees wide in declination .",
    "if we select from the sdss photometric catalogue all galaxies brighter than @xmath20 ( we do not apply the @xmath21 magnitude limit of the sdss main galaxy survey , but we do apply all the other star - galaxy classification criteria used in that sample ( see * ? ? ? * ) ) , then in this area there are @xmath22 galaxies that are in both catalogues .",
    "we find the fraction of sdss galaxies which are also in the 2dfgrs to be constant at @xmath23% as faint as @xmath24 .",
    "fainter than this , sdss galaxies are missing from the 2dfgrs sample simply due to the ( variable ) magnitude limit of the 2dfgrs survey and its @xmath25  magnitude random photometric errors .",
    "this finding is in perfect accord with the estimates made with the sdss edr @xcite in @xcite .",
    "this @xmath26% incompleteness has been investigated by @xcite as well as @xcite and has been shown to be predominately due to incorrect star - galaxy classification .",
    "the star - galaxy classification parameters based on the apm photometry are noisy and this level of incompleteness is in line with what was expected @xcite .    the issue here is whether this incompleteness has any influence on estimates of galaxy clustering .",
    "we can look at this directly by plotting cone plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cones ] ) of the galaxies the two catalogues have in common and those missed by the 2dfgrs . here",
    "we plot only galaxies with @xmath27 to avoid issues with the 2dfgrs magnitude limit . here",
    "we see that @xmath28% of the sdss galaxies are in the 2dfgrs . comparing the two cone plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : cones ] , it appears that the galaxies missed by 2dfgrs are just a random sparse sampling of the structure seen in the matching sample and so there is no evidence that the incompletness has a spatial imprint .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_all ] we compare the ` deconvolved ' power spectra estimated from the full 2dfgrs catalogue and full sdss - dr5 sample using the methods we outlined in section  [ sec : method ] the power spectra we estimate are the underlying galaxy power spectra convolved with the window function of either the sdss of 2dfgrs as appropriate @xmath29 our random catalogues allow us to accurately estimate @xmath30 and from it determine the matrix of window functions that describe how our spherically averaged band power estimates are related to unconvolved power spectrum @xmath31 examples of these window functions for the sdss and 2dfgrs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wins ] . for all our quantitative analysis we use these window functions to convolve the model power spectra before comparing with the data .",
    "however for the purposes of visually comparing the 2dfgrs and sdss power spectra we have corrected the convolved estimates by multplying them through by the ratio a similar model power spectrum to its convolved counterpart .",
    "this deconvolution is accurate provided the power spectra are smooth .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_all ] we note that the sdss and 2dfgrs galaxy power spectra agree well for @xmath32  h  mpc@xmath33 .",
    "the good agreement in amplitude at this wavenumber is due to the bias dependent weights used in the pvp estimator which have sucessfully modelled the difference in the clustering strength of the red selected sdss galaxies and blue selected 2dfgrs galaxies .",
    "this is by design as the bias factors were normalized empirically by the 2dfgrs red and blue samples at this scale ( see figure  15 of * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , on larger scales we see evidence for significantly more large scale power in the 2dfgrs than in sdss .",
    "fitting power spectra of the form @xmath34 to these data yields the parameter constraints on @xmath35 and @xmath36 shown in inset panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_all ] .",
    "here we have kept the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which model non - inear distortions of the power spectrum , fixed at fiducial values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 such that the difference in shape of the fitted power spectra are completely characterized by the parameter combinations @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we note that the 2dfgrs and sdss best fit values lie outside each others 95% confidence contours and that the sdss parameter estimates are completely in accord with those from @xcite , but with much tighter bounds due to the larger sdss dataset used here .",
    "thus the first thing to note is that the difference between the sdss and 2dfgrs results that was noted in the introduction and which motivated this analysis is certainly significant and not an artifact of differing analysis techniques .",
    "we now investigate if the discrepant shapes of the galaxy power spectra are due to the difference in the clustering properties of red and blue galaxies .",
    "fig  [ fig : colhist ] shows histograms of rest frame @xmath41 colours for both the 2dfgrs and sdss catalogues .",
    "the sdss magnitudes have been converted to these bands assuming the relations given in equation  [ eqn : col ] .",
    "the colour distributions are clearly bimodal with a natural dividing point at @xmath42 .",
    "the 2dfgrs has roughly equal numbers of red and blue galaxies while the sdss , being red selected , is naturally dominated by red galaxies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_red ] we compare the galaxy spectra estimated from just the galaxies redder than @xmath43 in both samples . comparing the sdss @xmath7 from just the red galaxies with the previous estimate from the full sdss catalogue reveals them to be in very close agreement .",
    "this is to be expected as the sdss sample is both dominated by red galaxies and the pvp power spectrum estimator that we employ gives them more weight than their less clustered blue counterparts .",
    "in contrast the estimate for just the red 2dfgrs galaxies differs from that from all the 2dfgrs catalogue .",
    "in fact it is a much closer match to the result from the sdss data .",
    "the only places where the two estimates are not in excellent agreement is on the very largest scales @xmath44  h  mpc@xmath33 , where the estimates are both noisy and highly correlated , and also around @xmath45  h  mpc@xmath33 .",
    "in fact this difference is also due to sample variance .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of removing from the 2dfgrs catalogue the two largest super clusters .",
    "their figure  17 ( panels  o and  p ) shows that this in general has a small effect , but does perturb the power just around @xmath45  h  mpc@xmath33 .",
    "agreement , within the expected statistical uncertainty , is confirmed in the inset panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_red ] where we see the best fitting parameters for 2dfgrs lie within the sdss 67% confidence contour and vice versa .",
    "note that again we have kept the parameters describing the nonlinear distortion fixed .",
    "the conclusion of this investigation is that a significant difference exists between the shape of the galaxy power spectra measured in the 2dfgrs and sdss surveys and that this difference is due to scale dependent bias .",
    "if a homogenous sample of red galaxies is selected from each survey then the resulting power spectra agree to within the expected statistical errors .",
    "in contrast , when the full 2dfgrs and sdss catalogues are analyzed the resulting 2dfgrs power spectrum differs in shape to that of sdss .",
    "if normalized on scales around @xmath46  h  mpc@xmath33 , as is done automatically by the scale independent bias factors assumed in the pvp estimator , then the 2dfgrs @xmath7 exhibits more large scale power than sdss .",
    "however , if one instead normalizes on large scales one finds the equivalent result that sdss exhibits more small scale power than 2dfgrs .",
    "this behaviour is exactly what one expects if the more strongly clustered red galaxies live in denser environments where the effects of nonlinearity are greater .",
    "this comparsion has revealed that to get unbiased estimates of the cosmological parameters it is necessary to better understand and constrain the distortion in the shape of the power spectrum caused by nonlinearity and scale dependent bias . in @xcite a first attempt at modelling this distortion was introduced using the @xmath38 and @xmath37 parameters of equation  ( [ eqn : nonlin ] ) . for the mix of red and blue galaxies",
    "present in the 2dfgrs survey , the necessary value of @xmath38 was reasonably small and the hence the scale dependent correction quite modest . however for samples of redder or more luminous and hence more clustered galaxies one expects greater nonlinearity and either greater values of @xmath38 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ] or the possible breakdown of this simple model .",
    "thus to get robust constraints from the main sdss survey and in particular the sdss luminous red galaxy survey will require more detailed modelling of nonlinearity and scale dependent bias ."
