    "1.0truecm assuming 3-@xmath0 mixing and massive majorana neutrinos , we have analyzed the implications of the results of the solar neutrino experiments , including the latest sno data , which favor the lma msw solution of the solar neutrino problem with @xmath1 , for the predictions of the effective majorana mass in -decay .",
    "neutrino mass spectra with normal mass hierarchy , with inverted hierarchy and of quasi - degenerate type are considered . for @xmath233 , which follows ( at 99.73% c.l . ) from the analysis of the solar neutrino data performed in @xcite , we find significant lower limits on in the cases of quasi - degenerate and inverted hierarchy neutrino mass spectrum , @xmath234 ev and @xmath4 ev , respectively .",
    "if the neutrino mass spectrum is hierarchical ( with inverted hierarchy ) , the upper limit holds @xmath235 ev .",
    "correspondingly , not only a measured value of @xmath6 , but even an experimental upper limit on of the order of @xmath236 ev can provide information on the type of the neutrino mass spectrum ; it can provide also a significant upper limit on the mass of the lightest neutrino @xmath8 .",
    "further reduction of the lma solution region due to data , e.g. , from the experiments sno , kamland and borexino , leading , in particular , to an increase ( a decreasing ) of the current lower ( upper ) bound of @xmath237 can strengthen further the above conclusions .    using the best fit values of @xmath215 , @xmath216 from @xcite and of @xmath63 and @xmath217 from @xcite",

    "therefore , if @xmath63 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 will be determined with a high precision ( @xmath221 uncertainty ) using the data from the minos , kamland and the solar neutrino experiments and their best fit values will not change substantially with respect to those used in the present analysis , a measurement of @xmath132 would rule out a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum ( @xmath86 ) even if there exists a factor of @xmath222 uncertainty in the value of due to a poor knowledge of the corresponding nuclear matrix element(s ) .",
    "an experimental upper limit of @xmath223 suffering from the same factor of @xmath222 ( or smaller ) uncertainty would rule out the quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum , while if the uncertainty under discussion is by a factor not bigger than @xmath224 , the spectrum with inverted hierarchy would be strongly disfavored ( if not ruled out ) .",
    "finally , a measured value of @xmath9 ev , which would imply a quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum , combined with data on neutrino masses from the @xmath10h @xmath11decay experiment katrin ( an upper limit or a measured value ) , might allow to establish whether the cp - symmetry is violated in the lepton sector .    after the work on the present study was essentially completed , few new global analyses of the solar neutrino data have appeared @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite do not differ substantially from those derived in @xcite ; in particular , the ( 99.73% c.l . ) minimal allowed values of @xmath237 in the lma solution region found in @xcite and in @xcite practically coincide .",
