    "we use the light - traces - mass ( ltm ) modeling technique by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) to construct a lensing model for macs2135 .",
    "we briefly describe the method here and address the reader to the said works for full details .",
    "our model generally consists of three components : a galaxy component , which is a superposition of all galaxy mass contributions ; a dark matter ( dm ) smooth component , which is a smoothed version of the galaxy component ; and a two - component external shear .    as mentioned in  2 , we start with the list of red - sequence cluster galaxies and their photometry . to construct the galaxy component ,",
    "each member galaxy is assigned with a power - law mass density distribution , scaled by its luminosity , where the superposition of all galaxies makes the total galaxy component of the model .",
    "the power - law exponent is the same for all galaxies and is a free parameter of the model .    to obtain the dm smooth component , the galaxy component mass density map",
    "is then smoothed with a 2d gaussian , whose width is a free parameter of the model . in that respect ,",
    "both the galaxy and dm component follow the light distribution in an approximate sense as desired , since the finite statistical number of galaxies means we can not expect an identical distribution .",
    "the two components are then combined with a relative weight , which is the third free parameter of the model .",
    "the overall normalization constitutes the fourth free parameter . a two component external shear",
    "is then added to allow for more flexibility , introducing effective ellipticity to the lens model .",
    "we also allow here for the mass of a few central bright cluster galaxies including the bcg , as well as their ellipticity and position - angle , to be freely optimized by the minimization procedure .",
    "the best fit is then obtained through a long ( few thousand step ) monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) , via a @xmath26 criteria minimizing the distance between the observed multiple images and those generated by the mass model . to infer the position of predicted images for each system",
    ", we use as source position the _ mean _ source position obtained by delensing to the source plane the different images of this system .",
    "we then relens this source back to the image plane to predict the appearance of the multiple images .",
    "one of the advantages of the ltm technique is that a well - guessed preliminary model can be constructed even with very few , or even none , multiple - images as input . in return",
    "the technique excels in predicting the location of multiple - images that can be then incorporated as constraints to iteratively improve the fit .",
    "we iteratively go over arclets and blue @xmath27 galaxies in the core of macs2135 and delens - relens them with a preliminary ltm model to match their counter images in the data ( based then , also , on a by - eye , sed and photo-@xmath0 examination , in addition to the model s prediction ) .",
    "similar to the success of this approach in other clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we identify here 6 new multiple images systems . after identifying the bulk of multiple images presented here in table [ multtable ] and figure [ fig1 ] , we run our final mass reconstruction .",
    "we fix the redshifts of systems 1 and 2 , that have spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath28 from @xcite , and allow for the redshift of all other systems to be optimized as free parameters in the minimization procedure , around their respective mean photo-@xmath0 s .",
    "the resulting critical curves of our model , for @xmath14 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] . the resulting mass density distribution , and mass profile ,",
    "are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "our final model has an image reproduction _",
    "rms _ of 1.68 , and a @xmath29 of 35.4 , using a positional uncertainty of 1.4 .",
    "@xcite found that while the true positional measurement error is small , this value is more representable of also systematic uncertainties between different modeling techniques , and folds within also discrepancies generated by random structures along the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice",
    ", we use a posteriori the value of 1.4  for extracting the errors around the best fit , but the minimization itself was performed using a positional uncertainty of 0.5  for most images , and 0.25  for the radial systems 1 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "we also used the parity of these three systems to force the radial critical curve to pass between the pairs of radial images ( this was done by `` punishing '' the @xmath29 term if the input parity was violated ) .",
    "we measure an effective einstein radius of @xmath30 for the redshift of systems 1 and 2 .",
    "this radius is the circular equivalent radius given the total enclosed area , i.e. @xmath31 . the critical curves for this redshift enclose @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "using hst images coupled with our ltm mass modeling we have identified , in addition to the two systems previously known @xcite , six new multiply - imaged systems in macs2135 , roughly quadrupling the number of constraints to map the matter distribution in this cluster .",
    "we have correspondingly constructed a significantly improved mass model for macs2135 , which we present here and make available for the astronomical community .",
    "our model agrees well with this cluster being a large lens , as perhaps is expected given the distance of system 2 from the bcg , and in broad agreement with the estimate presented in @xcite .",
    "only a small fraction of the clusters well - studied in the literature are known to exhibit einstein radii exceeding @xmath32 ( nominally , for sources at redshifts around @xmath33 ) .",
    "for example , only few out of the 25 x - ray selected clash clusters have einstein radii comparable to , or slightly larger than that of macs2135 , and only a few clusters previously analyzed have considerably larger critical areas , e.g. abell 1703 , @xcite ; macs 0717 @xcite ; rxj1347 @xcite , abell 1689 @xcite ; a370 @xcite ; rcs2 j232727.6 - 020437 , @xcite ; sdss j120923.7 + 264047 @xcite ; or cl0024 @xcite .",
    "indeed , thanks to their large critical areas all of these clusters show numerous multiply - imaged background galaxies , typically revealed in deep hst imaging . additionally , the hff clusters for example , aside for the giant lens macs0717 @xcite and perhaps a370 @xcite , show typically einstein radii of @xmath34 . here",
    "we add to this important list macs2135 , showing that despite it current relatively shallow imaging , it also lenses an abundance of highly magnified , multiply - lensed background sources , and is comparable in size to the typical hff cluster .",
    "finding large and prominent lensing clusters is useful for probing the massive - end of the cluster mass function @xcite , for constraining cosmological models @xcite , and also for studying the dm , substructure , morphology and merging properties of the clusters @xcite .",
    "large lenses also increase the chances for finding very high redshift galaxies often pushing the redshift limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the case of multiple images we can use the separation between the images to provide a purely  geometric \" distance for the source as a means of testing the often ambiguous photometric redshift @xcite .",
    "in fact , two high-@xmath0 candidates have already been reported in macs 2135 @xcite , one of which our model predicts should lie nearly on top the critical curves for high redshift , and thus might be highly magnified and potentially multiply imaged .",
    "we leave further examination of this candidate for other , dedicated work .",
    "the lensing approach to studying high-@xmath0 galaxies is sensitive to the faint - end slope of the luminosity function , and complements the field work with hubble that is also uncovering relatively luminous high-@xmath0 galaxies over wider areas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it should be appreciated that not only the einstein radius of a lens is important in assessing the lensing efficiency of various clusters , but as we have shown before , other factors must be considered , such as the magnification distribution ( which is related to the gradient of the central mass distribution ) , substructure and sub - clumps that add non - linearly to the magnification @xcite , or the ellipticity of mass distribution which enhances the lensing cross - section @xcite , as well as of course , the redshifts involved and the magnification bias which depends on the slope of the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "we conclude that macs2135 is amongst the top lenses currently known , and will benefit from future attention .",
    "this includes deeper space imaging to uncover very distant high - redshift dropouts in the nir , and as a compelling candidate target , in this respect , for jwst .",
