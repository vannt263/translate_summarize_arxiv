    "advanced materials utilizing carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are emerging . recently",
    ", we reported a macroscopic fiber composed of tightly packed and well - aligned cnts , which combines specific strength , stiffness , and thermal conductivity of carbon fibers with the specific electrical conductivity of metals ( `` specific '' : normalized by the linear mass density).@xcite these macroscopic cnt fibers hold the promise to replace traditional metals for many applications including making stronger and lighter power transmission cables or electronic interconnections,@xcite as well as durable field emission or thermionic emission sources.@xcite these applications require the fiber to operate under high current , which leads to natural questions about the fiber s ability to carry such a current without being damaged .",
    "traditionally , current carrying capacity ( ccc ) , or often called ampacity , is used to quantify this ability .",
    "ccc is defined as the maximum amount of current a cable ( including any insulating layer ) can carry before sustaining immediate or progressive damages ; sometimes , it is more convenient to use the current density , especially when making comparisons among different types of cables .",
    "also , for weight - critical applications , for instance , in the aerospace industry , specific ccc ( ccc normalized by the linear mass density ) is usually considered .",
    "owing to the strong c - c bond , the ccc of individual cnts can exceed 10@xmath3  a / m@xmath2 without damage by electromigration,@xcite which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the electromigration limit of copper.@xcite however , such superb ccc ( limited by intrinsic optical phonon emission ) becomes unapproachable when many cnts are packed together to form a macroscopic cnt fiber or bundle .",
    "the unavoidable inter - tube transport significantly increases the resistivity , and the resultant joule heating at high current densities raises the temperature , inducing damages and ultimately breaking the fiber .",
    "thus , the competition between current - induced joule heating and cooling by thermal environments becomes the determinant of the ccc , as in metal cables ; this competition scales with the volume - to - surface ratio , which increases with increasing cable diameter , making joule heating progressively more problematic for larger diameter cables .",
    "so far , the most widely studied case for cnt networks is their immediate breakdown ( usually in seconds or less ) when carrying high current .",
    "the damage usually initiates around the hottest spot , particularly if associated with defects , kinks , or impurities.@xcite the corresponding current limit can be defined as the failure current density ( fcd ) , similar to the fuse current limit for metal cables . on the other hand , to be used as a power cable , cnt wires must operate below a regulations - specified temperature called the `` operating temperature '' ( @xmath4 ) to avoid damaging its own insulation layer or other nearby accessories .",
    "the corresponding current limit is defined as the continuous current rating ( ccr).@xcite since @xmath4 can not be high enough to cause any damages , ccr is always much lower than the failure current .",
    "in contrast to metal power cables , whose ccr is well studied@xcite and regulated,@xcite so far no systematic study of these quantities for cnt wires is available .    here , we determined both fcd and ccr for cnt fibers under various test conditions .",
    "we first measured the fcds of those fibers .",
    "we monitored how the resistivity of the fiber under test evolved as a function of current density and found four distinct regimes .",
    "the measured fcds varied from 10@xmath0 to 10@xmath1  a / m@xmath2 , depending on the dimensions of those fibers and test conditions . in particular , the measured fcd in vacuum was much lower than in gases due to a lack of heat exchange by gases , while the measured fcd in air was smaller than in the other tested gases because of oxidation .",
    "we then analyzed the heat exchange between cnt fibers and each type of gas and extracted the thermal conductance ( @xmath5 ) between them .",
    "we proved that the heat exchange is governed by natural convection .",
    "in addition , we showed that due to tight packing and good alignment , gas molecules do not penetrate the body of the cnt fibers .",
    "when @xmath5 is known , in principle , any thermally determined ccc can be deduced if the corresponding temperature limit is given , and vice versa . as an example , we determined ccr for infinitely long cnt fibers with an operating temperature of 363  k.    based on these measurements and heat - exchange analysis , we were able to make a comprehensive comparison of ccc with other cables .",
    "we showed that the fcd of our fibers is higher than previously reported carbon fibers and cnt fibers .",
    "we then compared these two parameters with a pure copper wire .",
    "both the fcd and ccr of copper were still higher than cnt fibers mainly due to copper s lower resistivity .",
    "however , when normalized by the mass density , both specific fc ( sfc ) and ccr of copper wire were lower than those of these lightweight cnt fibers .",
    "considering the fact that commercial transmission cables usually require extra reinforcement by a steel core because of copper s heavier weight and lower tensile strength , the combination of higher specific ccc and stronger mechanical strength of cnt fibers makes them promising candidates for transmission cables .",
    "cnt fibers were produced by wet spinning.@xcite purified cnts were dissolved in chlorosulfonic acid at a concentration of 3  wt@xmath6 and filtered to form a spinnable liquid crystal dope.@xcite the dope was then extruded through a spinneret ( 65130  @xmath7 m in diameter for different diameter fibers ) into a coagulant ( acetone or water ) to remove the acid .",
    "the forming filament was collected onto a winding drum with a linear velocity higher than the extrusion velocity to enhance the alignment .",
    "the produced fibers were further washed in water and dried in an oven at 115@xmath8c .",
    "such fiber is called an acid - doped fiber .",
    "tga shows that there still remains about 7 wt@xmath9 of acid residuals in the acid - doped fiber.@xcite on the other hand , if the produced fibers were first dried in an oven at 115@xmath8c and then washed in water , there would be even more acid residuals in the fiber .",
    "such fiber is called a heavily acid - doped fiber . the 99.99% pure copper wire with 0.001",
    "inch diameter was purchased from espicorp , inc .          a copper substrate with a wide river bed and two narrow river banks",
    "was used to hang the cable ( either a cnt fiber or copper wire ) as shown in fig .",
    "the depth of the bed was @xmath103  mm and the width @xmath1023  mm .",
    "the cable was bent into a z - turn with its mid - section suspended over the river bed .",
    "each arm was placed on a thin ( 100  @xmath7 m ) electrically - insulating quartz slide , which was itself placed on the river bank .",
    "several silver epoxy electrodes ( @xmath100.5  mm wide ) were placed on the fiber for resistivity measurements . in particular , two electrodes ( denoted by a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) were placed at the ends of the suspended portion of the cable .",
    "electrode c was placed 2  mm away from electrode a and b , and bc serves as a local probe to monitor the resistivity change at the end of the suspended fiber .",
    "the whole device was assembled on a vacuum - sealed heating - cooling stage in which the temperature of the device and the gas environment could be adjusted .",
    "the experimental procedure is shown in the flow chart in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "first , the sample is uniformly heated up and cooled down by the heating - cooling stage , while the resistivity of of the ab section is measured as a function of temperature [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "then a current sweep is carried out in high vacuum ( 10@xmath11 torr ) , in one of four dry gases ( nitrogen , helium , argon , and air ) at atmospheric pressure , or on an intrinsic silicon substrate in air . in this step ,",
    "the current is gradually swept up to reach the desired current density , held for 30 seconds , and then gradually swept down to 1  ma [ see [ fig5](a ) ] .",
    "the experiment is halted if the fiber breaks .",
    "if the electrical properties of the fiber are unchanged by current sweeping , the i - v curves from all sweeping cycles show no hysteresis ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , red curve ) , but if they are changed , the i - v curve will initially follow the sweeping - down curve of the previous circle and then start to deviate ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , blue curve ) .",
    "since the fiber might not be homogeneously joule heated , the extracted resistivity is an average value given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the current density , voltage , and length of the cable with @xmath16 = ab and bc representing the measured section ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the resistivity versus temperature for the three highly - conductive cnt fibers@xcite we studied , together with that for the reference copper wire with a diameter of 25.4  @xmath7 m .",
    "the fibers we tested were electrically p - doped by the presence of sulfur and chlorine inside the fiber , which is a residuum from the chlorosulfonic acid solvent used in the fabrication of the fibers .",
    "the heavily acid - doped fiber contained more acid , making them less resistive .",
    "the room temperature resistivity for the heavily acid - doped fiber was about 2.57  @xmath17  10@xmath18  @xmath19 m while that of the 10.5  @xmath7 m diameter ( 20.5  @xmath7 m diameter ) acid - doped fiber was 4.12 ( 3.98 ) @xmath17 10@xmath18  @xmath19 m .",
    "on the other hand , the mass density of the heavily - doped sample was 1.5  @xmath17  10@xmath20  kg / m@xmath21 , as compared to 1.2  @xmath17  10@xmath20  kg / m@xmath21 of the other acid - doped fibers .",
    "another issue with fiber doping is its stability .",
    "we notice that in several cases , excessive acid doping makes the room temperature resistivity of several fibers as low as 1.7  @xmath17  10@xmath18  @xmath19 m , but at the same time , after annealing at 373  k , this value quickly returned back to about 2.5  @xmath17  10@xmath18  @xmath19 m .",
    "thus , the temperature range in which a fiber can be operated without any irreversible property change must be considered .",
    "the room temperature resistivity of copper is approximately one order of magnitude less than that of fibers .",
    "its accepted value is 1.725  @xmath17  10@xmath22  @xmath19 m while the measured value here was 1.74  @xmath17  10@xmath22  @xmath19 m . in all cases ,",
    "the resistivity ( @xmath23 ) linearly increased with temperature ( @xmath24 ) , i.e. , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ambient temperature , @xmath27 is the temperature measured from @xmath26 , and @xmath28 is a positive constant .",
    "this equation provides us with a convenient means for monitoring the temperature rise as a result of current - induced heating .",
    "figure [ fig1](b ) shows the resistivity as a function of current density for the 20-@xmath7m - diameter acid - doped fiber in vacuum for @xmath26 = 303  k. the resistivity is normalized to the initial value , @xmath29 = 3.98 @xmath17 10@xmath18  @xmath19 m , before the fiber is heated . as the current density increases",
    ", the temperature increases through joule heating , which in turn increases the resistivity through fig .",
    "[ eq_linear ] . starting from the lowest red curve , after a number of current - sweeping cycles , the resistivity versus current density curve undergoes irreversible changes with uneven paces . to better visualize this process , fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) plots the highest applied current density against the resistivity measured at a very low current density after each sweeping cycle [ along the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) reveals four distinct regimes as the current density is gradually increased from zero toward the ultimate value at which the fiber eventually breaks . in regime 1 , the i - v curve is reversible , and thus , the resistivity does not change after each sweeping cycle . in regime 2 ,",
    "a drastic irreversible process takes place , and the resistivity permanently increases by about 4 times . in regime 3 , the _ i - v curve becomes reversible again _ , showing stable properties of a new , current - annealed fiber ; i.e. , the acid , which is an effective dopant , is removed by heating .",
    "finally , in regime 4 , the resistivity starts increasing very rapidly until the fiber breaks .",
    "given sufficient time , any current - density value in regime 4 ultimately leads to fiber breaking .",
    "we define the current - density value that corresponds to the boundary between regimes 3 and 4 as the failure current density , or fcd , of the fiber , which is different from the maximum current density before breaking ( mcdbb ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) for the difference between fcd and mcdbb .",
    "the value of mcdbb is ill - defined and can have a large uncertainty , depending on such experimental details as the sweeping speed , step size , sweeping method ( current or voltage ) , and sweeping pattern .",
    "one the other hand , fcd is determined by the characteristic temperature limits beyond which the quality of the fiber is altered .",
    "these temperature limits can be considered intrinsic because they reflect such fiber properties as the defect density , impurities , alignment , etc .",
    "therefore , fcd is a better quantity for characterizing the ccc of wires .",
    "unfortunately , all previously reported ccc for aligned buckypapers,@xcite carbon fibers,@xcite and cnt fibers@xcite are mcdbb values .",
    "the fcd value for the particular case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) is 1.03 @xmath17 10@xmath30  a / m@xmath2 , while the mcdbb is @xmath311.4 @xmath17 10@xmath30  a / m@xmath2 .      the data in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) provides significant insight into the mechanism by which the fiber leads to a catastrophic failure at high current densities . in regime 2 ,",
    "a drastic irreversible process occurs , and the resistivity becomes about four times larger than the original value . based on our modeling ( see appendix for detail ) , the maximum temperature of the fiber at the boundary between regimes 1 and 2 is about 470  k , which is higher than the boiling point of chlorosulfonic acid ( 423  k ) .",
    "therefore , we attribute the increase of resistivity in regime 2 to an irreversible reduction of charge carriers through removal of chlorosulfonic acid , a p - type dopant .",
    "even though regime 2 is fairly narrow , the increase of resistivity significantly increases joule heating . as a result , the finishing temperature ( at the boundary between regimes 2 and 3 ) is estimated to be @xmath311305  k. notably , the quality of the fiber is not degraded during the heating process in regime 2 , as confirmed by the maintained g / d ratio in raman spectra ( shown in appendix ) .",
    "the fact that the i - v curve is reversible again in regime 3 indicates that no chemical changes happen in this regime and the fiber is stable even though it is heated by high currents .",
    "thus , we are essentially dealing with an annealed fiber in this regime , whose properties are different from those of the original , acid - doped fiber in regime 1 .",
    "finally , as the average temperature exceeds @xmath311740  k , the fiber enters regime 4 , and the resistivity increases very rapidly , until it breaks .",
    "a close examination of @xmath23@xmath32 curves in regime 4 provides further insight into the final moments when the fiber is breaking apart .",
    "note that a typical curve in regime 4 , e.g. , the red dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , shows a qualitatively different trend than those in the other three regimes ; that is , the _",
    "resistivity initially decreases and then increases with increasing current density_. this unusual trend can be explained only if we consider the general temperature dependence of resistivity of these fibers in a wider temperature range .",
    "namely , with increasing temperature ( from , e.g. , 4.2  k ) , the resistivity initially decreases due to thermally - driven hopping transport and then increases due to intra - tube phonon - carrier scattering.@xcite the crossover temperature ( @xmath33 ) , where the resistivity is minimal , is lower than the ambient temperature in the fibers we study here .",
    "this is why fig .",
    "[ eq_linear ] holds in the 300 - 360  k range .",
    "however , when the fiber starts breaking , the @xmath23@xmath24 curve itself starts changing irreversibly and dynamically .",
    "specifically , as the fiber starts structurally deteriorating , the hopping transport contribution becomes more and more important in determining the resistivity , which pushes @xmath33 higher and higher during the breaking process .",
    "the fact that we see an initial decrease in resistivity in regime 4 ( e.g. , the green curve ) is evidence that @xmath33 has already become higher than @xmath26 .",
    "this is a self - intensified process because the initial damage forces a higher current through the remaining conductive paths , accelerating the breaking process .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows that the type of gas surrounding the fiber critically affects the boundaries of different current regimes . in an argon or nitrogen gas environment , our cnt fibers exhibit qualitatively the same behavior as in vacuum , but the boundaries of regimes",
    "are shifted to much higher values .",
    "this is understandable because the gas contributes convective cooling , whereas in vacuum black - body radiation is essentially the only thermal path , except through the end contacts .",
    "on the other hand , fibers break more easily in air , usually breaking already in regime 2 ; i.e. , the fcd value corresponds to the boundary between regimes 1 and 2 .",
    "we attribute this reduced fcd in air to the oxidation of carbon nanotubes , which can happen at temperatures between 773 and 873  k. the fcd values measured in different environments are summarized in table  [ table_fcd ] .",
    ".failure current density ( fcd ) , maximum current density before breaking ( mcdbb ) , and specific failure current ( sfc ) values determined for an acid - doped carbon nanotube fiber with a diameter of 20.5  @xmath7 m , through measurements in vacuum , argon , nitrogen , and air .",
    "the values in parentheses are the corresponding values estimated for copper ( see appendix for details on the estimations ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     both the fcd and mcdbb depend on the dimensions of the cable as well as the surrounding thermal media . in table 1 of ref .  , the values of the breakdown current density ( the same as the mcdbb in this paper ) for several suspended buckypapers in air and vacuum are listed .",
    "the largest value corresponds to the `` a - bp '' sample , which is 20  @xmath7 m thick and 20  cm long ; these dimensions are comparable to those of our fibers here ( 20  @xmath7 m in diameter and 30  cm in length ) .",
    "the mcdbb for this sample is 1.1  @xmath17  10@xmath34  a / m@xmath2 in air and 3.1  @xmath17  10@xmath34  a / m@xmath2 in vacuum , both of which are much smaller than the values for our acid - doped fiber ( 2.11  @xmath17  10@xmath0  a / m@xmath2 in air and 1.36  @xmath17  10@xmath0  a / m@xmath2 in vacuum ) .    in table 1 of ref .",
    ", the maximum current values of several cnt fibers as well as a carbon fiber , all laid on substrates , are listed .",
    "the lengths of those samples were only about 500  @xmath7 m , and therefore , heat dissipation is not only through the substrate but also through the electrodes ( heat dissipation through the air can be ignored ) .",
    "since it is very hard to make identical solid - to - solid interfaces between a fiber and those two media in each test , the measured mcdbb values would contain large test - to - test fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , we tested several acid - doped fibers with 10  @xmath7 m diameter and @xmath311  mm length on substrates ; the maximum current varied from 100 to 125  ma , corresponding to 1.15  @xmath17  10@xmath1  a / m@xmath2 to 1.44  @xmath17  10@xmath1  a / m@xmath2 in mcdbb , more than 2 times the value of the fiber with either 9.1 or 13.3  @xmath7 m diameter in ref .  .",
    "it is also larger than the mcdbb of a pan carbon fiber with 6.1  @xmath7 m diameter ( 0.82  @xmath17  10@xmath1  a / m@xmath2 ) in ref .  .",
    "it even exceeds the largest mcdbb ( 1.03  @xmath17  10@xmath1  a / m@xmath2 ) in ref .",
    ", which was for the smallest fibril with 5.6  @xmath7 m diameter .",
    "reducing the diameter of the fiber is expected to improve the fcd and mcdbb values because of the enlarged surface - to - volume ratio .",
    "namely , the amount of joule heating is @xmath35 , which is proportional to the volume , while heat dissipation is @xmath36 , which is proportional to the surface area .",
    "therefore , the maximum current density , which is determined by the balance between the two , should be proportional to @xmath37 ( assuming that the other parameters do not vary with the diameter ) . based on this expectation , we can project a factor of 1.35 improvement in mcdbb when the diameter of the acid - doped fiber decreases from 10.5 to 5.6  @xmath7 m .",
    "similarly , we can estimate the mcdbb of acid - doped fibers with diameters ranging from 10.5 to 4.2  @xmath7 m to compare with the fiber reported in the supplementary information of ref .",
    "( although the length of the fiber was not specified ) . the projected mcdbb varies from 1.62  @xmath17  10@xmath1 to 2.25  @xmath17  10@xmath1  a / m@xmath2 , which are better than the value of 1.62  @xmath17  10@xmath1  a / m@xmath2 reported in ref .  .",
    "to demonstrate that the quality of the fiber is not degraded during the irreversible current - heating process in regime 2 , we performed raman spectroscopy before and after going through the heating process .",
    "figure  [ figs3 ] shows that the g / d ratio is very well maintained at a small value ( 4 - 5 @xmath17 10@xmath38 ) ."
