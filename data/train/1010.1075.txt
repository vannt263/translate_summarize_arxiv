    "magnetic resonance ( mr ) as a physical concept has been applied in various fields , enabling physical , chemical , and medical experiments to obtain information on nuclear spin and electron spin systems .",
    "the concept has also provided valuable information to help understand the unknown structures of many condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "the use of mr in the study of ferromagnets , _ e.g. _ nickel , cobalt , and iron , began in the 1940s .",
    "griffiths observed that the land s @xmath0-factor of electrons in ferromagnets was far from the well known value , 2 @xcite . in order to understand these anomalous results , kittel theoretically introduced a demagnetizing field into the equation representing the motion of the magnetization @xmath1",

    "i.e. _ resonance frequency , @xmath10 which explained the anomalous @xmath0-factor .",
    "furthermore , he found that the resonance frequency depends on the shape of a ferromagnet because @xmath7 depends on the shape @xcite .",
    "thus , ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) was established , and the work enabled numerous additional studies @xcite .",
    "mr also plays an important role in quantum condensate systems . in superfluid @xmath11he ,",
    "the dynamics of the spin vector and the @xmath12-vector are represented by the leggett equation , which couples these vectors through magnetic dipole - dipole interactions @xcite .",
    "the equation also shows not only an mr typical of condensed matter , but also a new mr that can not be described using the equations of motion for general paramagnets and ferromagnets .",
    "this mr was used to find @xmath13 and @xmath14 phases @xcite .",
    "parallel ringing , which is an oscillation of longitudinal magnetization , was also observed @xcite .    since the discovery of atomic bose ",
    "einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , becs have been studied in optics and atomic and condensed matter physics .",
    "we have introduced mr into becs to realize magnetic resonance imaging , a popular method of nondestructive testing .",
    "spinor becs are expected to be suitable for mr , since they have not only internal degrees of freedom but also magnetic properties . in particular",
    ", we are interested in magnetic dipole - dipole interactions ( mddi ) in spinor becs , which have been actively studied .",
    "the interaction between spins has a characteristic symmetry of rotation and spin , which is expected to result in a new quantum phase @xcite and einstein  de haas effects @xcite .",

    "the shape of the condensates clearly represented the anisotropy of the interaction @xcite .",

    "the spin echo is a typical phenomenon of mr , discovered by hahn @xcite and developed by carr and purcell @xcite .",

    "the mddi of the kittel equations is considered as the origin of the demagnetizing field , which is phenomenologically introduced in eq . .",

    "comparing eq . with eq .",
    ", we noticed several differences .",
    "first , eq . was directly derived from the gp equations , whereas eq .",
    "is a phenomenological equation of magnetization .",
    "the spin density vectors in eq .",
    "are microscopically affected by other spins through the dipolar fields in the effective magnetic fields . on the other hand , the magnetization in eq .",
    "is affected by demagnetizing fields originating from macroscopically polarized magnetization in the condensed matter .",
    "namely , eq . can describe the macroscopic demagnetizing field resulting from the microscopic dipolar field .",
    "this is a very important difference between these equations .",
    "we initially investigated the physics of the first and second terms of eq . .",
    "to simplify the discussion , we considered the equation under the condition @xmath50 .",
    "thus , we derived the continuity equations , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an effective current term ,    [ eq : spincurrents ] @xmath53    equation can also be rewritten as , @xmath54 by using the volume integral and the surface integral , whose unit vector @xmath55 is vertical to the surface for stokes theorem .",
    "the equation indicates that the expectation value of the spin matrix @xmath56 in the volume @xmath17 is conserved for the spin probability flux @xmath57 leaving and entering the surface .    under @xmath58",
    ", the kittel - like equation can be reduced to the following equation , @xmath59_i,\\ ] ] where the right side of the equation breaks the conservation law of spin density .",
    "therefore , the kittel - like equations have two dynamics : spin precessions with frequency given by the effective magnetic field and spin currents without spin conservation .",
    "the spin currents of the system will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : spincurrent ]",
    "in order to study the basic properties of the second term in eq . , we introduced the single - mode approximation , @xmath60 where @xmath61 satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath62 with the relation @xmath63 .",
    "the approximation is effective when the shapes of the condensates are determined by the spin - independent terms , namely @xmath64 @xcite . for @xmath65rb and @xmath66na ,",

    "next , we consider a small deviation @xmath74 around the stationary solution , @xmath75 with @xmath76 , of eq .",
    ", namely @xmath77 . introducing this representation into eq . and linearizing the equation , we derived the following equations , @xmath78 which give the resonance frequency , @xmath79 the spin precesses with the resonance frequency @xmath80 , which depends on the dipolar terms @xmath81 .    here",
    ", we consider the single particle density distribution @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the aspect ratio , and discuss simple situations .",
    "for the spherical case of @xmath84 , the integration results in @xmath85 , giving @xmath86 .",
    "the dipolar fields are canceled because of the isotropy , so that the spin precesses with larmor frequency . for the circular plane ( infinite cylinder )",
    "case of @xmath87 , we obtain @xmath88 for @xmath89 .    in this representation",
    ", it seems that the microscopic dipolar fields , eq .",
    ", act as a macroscopic demagnetizing field to compare eq . with .",
    "we believe that the origin of the demagnetizing field is an mddi . if the above discussion is correct , the dipolar coefficients @xmath81 should depend on the shape of the condensates .",
    "however , the single - mode approximation in spinor dipolar becs is not effective in large - aspect - ratio condensates , as discussed by yi and pu @xcite .",
    "therefore , we must consider the spin dynamics beyond the approximation .",
    "in this section , we discuss fmr by numerically calculating the two - dimensional eq . under the condition of @xmath65rb , namely @xmath91 .",
    "we began calculating the spin precessions by applying a @xmath92 pulse to the ground state , whose spins were polarized to the uniform magnetic field @xmath30 trapped by @xmath93 with @xmath94 and an aspect ratio @xmath95 .",

    "<S> , we obtained equations similar to the kittel equations used to represent ferromagnetic resonance in condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> these equations indicated that the ferromagnetic resonance originated from dipolar interaction , and that the resonance frequency depended upon the shape of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , spin currents driven by spin diffusions are characteristic of this system . </S>"
