    "cooperative behaviors ( mutualism and altruism ) are ubiquitous in human society as well as in virtual online community . for instance , people unselfishly and collaboratively recommend commodities such as books , songs , cd / dvds , etc to each other .",
    "accordingly , this cooperative behavior ( collaborative recommendation ) promotes the long tail which is the success foundation of amazon and ebay  @xcite . and",
    "yet , according to darwinism , natural selection is based on competition .",
    "how can natural selection lead to cooperation among selfish individuals ? fortunately , together with classic game theory , evolutionary game theory provides a systematic framework for investigating the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behavior among unrelated and selfish individuals .",
    "two simple games , namely , prisoner s dilemma game ( pdg ) and snowdrift game ( sg ) , as metaphors for studying the evolution of cooperation have been extensively adopted by researchers from different background  @xcite . in the original pdg ,",
    "two players simultaneously decide whether to cooperate ( c ) or to defect ( d ) .",
    "they both receive @xmath0 upon mutual cooperation and @xmath1 upon mutual defection .",
    "a defector exploiting a c player gets @xmath2 , and the exploited cooperator receives @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 . as a result , it is best to defect regardless of the co - player s decision . thus , in well - mixed infinite populations , defection is the evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess )  @xcite , even though all individuals would be better off if they cooperated .",
    "thereby this creates the social dilemma , because when everybody defects , the mean population payoff is lower than that when everybody cooperates .",
    "whereas in the sg , the order of @xmath1 and @xmath3 is exchanged , such that @xmath5 .",
    "its essential ingredient is that in contrast to the pdg , cooperation has an advantage when rare , which implies that the replicator dynamics of the sg converges to a mixed stable equilibrium where both c and d strategies are present  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that in this state the population payoff is smaller than it would be if everyone played c , hence the sg still represents a social dilemma  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the sg is of much applications and interests within biological context . in order to solve these social dilemmas ,",
    "a variety of suitable extensions on these basic models has been investigated  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , it is found that cooperation can be promoted and sustained in the network - structured population substantially  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the successful development of network science provides a convenient framework for describing the dynamical interactions of games .",
    "the evolution of cooperation on model networks with features such as lattices  @xcite , small - world  @xcite , scale - free  @xcite , and community structure  @xcite has been scrutinized . moreover",
    ", the understanding of the effect of network structure on the evolution of cooperation reaches to consensus gradually : the heterogeneity of the network of contacts plays a significant role in the emergence of cooperation .",
    "however , the puzzle of cooperation is unanswered yet .",
    "what on earth conditions the emergence of cooperation is still a challenging problem  @xcite .",
    "most noteworthy , nowak summarized five possible rules for the evolution of cooperation corresponding to different situations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . nevertheless , to our best knowledge , these results are mostly based upon simplified scenario and model . to inspect the evolution of cooperation , further details and characteristics of real world",
    "should be considered and integrated .",
    "the world wide web ( www ) in its first decade was like a big online library , where people mainly searched for information . today ,",
    "owing to new social technologies , the web is undergoing a subtle but profound shift , dubbed _ web 2.0 _ , to become more of a social web , not unlike the www inventor tim berners - lee s original vision .",
    "the use of collaborative technologies such as blogs and wikis also leads to change of the ways of people s thinking and communicating .",
    "people , especially college students , take advantage of online social network services for messaging , sharing information , and keeping in touch with each other .",
    "this creates an emerging online community which is largely being shaped by dynamic interactions between users in real time .",
    "therefore , these services provide an extraordinary online laboratory to study dynamic pattern of social interactions conveniently and effectively . in",
    "what follows , the two aforementioned metaphors  pdg and sg in an empirical social network will be examined .    in this paper , we present our observations into a chinese social networking site open to college students ( the social networking site xiaonei , which began in late 2005 in select universities , but grew quickly to encompass a very large number of universities . ) .",
    "we empirically study the evolution of cooperation on such online social network which retains the essential of real - world social interactions .",
    "in particular , it is suggested that the evolution of cooperation on empirical social networks is influenced by a variey of network effects , including heterogeneity , small - world effect , local highly - connected clusters , average connectivity , etc . in the rest of this paper , first , we will analyze the structure of the online social network , then investigate the two social dilemmas ( pdg and sg ) on this social network by the method analogous to replicator dynamics , observing the time evolution of cooperation .",
    "after that , we discuss the simulation results and make explanations . finally , we draw the conclusion remarks .",
    "of the online social network .",
    "the dot line indicates the critical degree @xmath6 : for @xmath7 , @xmath8 follows a power - law as @xmath9 , while for @xmath10 , @xmath8 obeys a power - law as @xmath11 .",

    "a clear power - law is absent , but @xmath15 s dependence on @xmath14 is nontrivial .",
    "the dot line has slope @xmath16.[fig2],width=377 ]    the actual relational data was obtained from a chinese social networking site open to college students .",
    "we focus on the connected component , which is composed of @xmath17 nodes and @xmath18 bidirectional edges ( we viewed this network as undirected one ) .",
    "we perform statistical analysis of the structure of this social network .",
    "the quantities such as degree distribution , clustering coefficient , average shortest path length , etc are calculated to capture the features of the online social network . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we report the degree distribution @xmath8 , which gives the probability that randomly selected node has exactly @xmath14 edges . clearly , we can see that @xmath8 follows two different scalings with @xmath14 , depending on the specified critical degree value @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath8 obeys a power - law form @xmath20 with @xmath21 when @xmath22 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 for @xmath10 .",
    "the degree distribution above the critical degree @xmath19 is consistent with past findings of social networks with the degree exponent @xmath25  @xcite . whereas , for small degree @xmath14 below @xmath19 , the scaling exponent of @xmath8 is less than two . considerable fraction of nodes have only low connectivity ( see tab .",

    "the average degree @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    ".[tab : degree]percentage of nodes with 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 degrees .",
    "note that a large fraction of nodes have only small degrees .",

    "the clustering coefficient of node @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 , that is the ratio between the number @xmath35 of edges that actually exit between these @xmath36 neighbor nodes of node @xmath33 and the total number @xmath37 .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of all individual @xmath38 s .",
    "we find the clustering coefficient @xmath39 , order of magnitude much higher than that of a corresponding random graph of the same size @xmath40 .",
    "besides , the degree - dependent local clustering coefficient @xmath15 is averaging @xmath38 over vertices of degree @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig2 ] plots the distribution of @xmath15 vs. @xmath14 . for clarity ,",
    "we add the dot line with slope @xmath16 in the log - log scale . however , it is hard to declare a clear power law in our case .",
    "nevertheless , the nonflat clustering coefficient distributions shown in the figure suggests that the dependency of @xmath15 on @xmath14 is nontrivial , and thus points to some degree of hierarchy in the networks . in many networks",
    ", the average clustering coefficient @xmath15 exhibits a highly nontrivial behavior with a power - law decay as a function of @xmath14  @xcite , indicating that low - degree nodes generally belong to well - interconnected communities ( corresponding to high clustering coefficient of the low - connectivity nodes ) , while high - degree sites are linked to many nodes that may belong to different groups ( resulting in small clustering coefficient of the large - degree nodes ) .",
    "this is generally the feature of a nontrivial architecture in which small - degree vertices are well - clustered around the hubs ( high degree vertices ) , and organized in a hierarchical manner into increasingly large groups .",
    "thus , our empirical social network has such fundamental characteristic of hierarchy .",
    "another important element characterizing the local organization of complex networks is the degree correlation of node @xmath33 and its neighbor . following newman  @xcite ,",
    "assortativity coefficient @xmath41 is measured by the pearson correlation coefficient of the degrees at either ends of an edge , which can be written as @xmath42 ^ 2}{m^{-1}\\sum_i\\frac{1}{2}(j_i^2+k_i^2)-[m^{-1}\\sum_i\\frac{1}{2}(j_i+k_i)]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 are the degrees of the vertices at the ends of the @xmath33th edge , with @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the total number of edges in the observed graph or network ) .",
    "we calculate the degree assortativity coefficient ( or degree - degree correlation ) @xmath41 of the online social network . in our case , @xmath46 , which means the social network shows `` disassortative mixing '' on its degrees .",
    "networks with assortative mixing pattern are those in which nodes with large degree tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections and vice visa .",

    "herein , we have presented the structural analysis of our online social network .",
    "the observed network has small - world property , that is , high clustering coefficient and short average shortest path length .",
    "moreover , it is an inhomogeneous one , namely , the tail of degree distribution obeys a power law .",
    "additionally , it has nontrivial hierarchical organizations ",
    "low - degree nodes generally belong to well - interconnected clusters , while high - degree vertices are linked to many nodes that may belong to different groups . besides , it exhibits disassortative mixing pattern .",
    "in the successive section , we will investigate the evolution of cooperation in the social network , revealing the cooperation level is affected by the topological organizations of the social network .",
    "we consider the evolutionary pdg and sg on the sampled social network ( composed of @xmath47 nodes ) which is a good representative of the original large - scale one .",
    "each vertex represents an individual and the edges denote links between players in terms of game dynamical interaction .",
    "the individuals are pure strategists , following two simple strategies : cooperate ( c ) and defect ( d ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of strategies is described by a two - dimensional unit vector for each player @xmath48 , namely , @xmath49 for cooperators and defectors , respectively .",
    "each individual plays the pdg / sg with its immediate `` neighbors '' defined by their who - meets - whom relationships and the incomes are accumulated .",
    "the total income of the player at the site @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath50 where the @xmath51 denotes the neighboring sites of @xmath48 , and the sum runs over neighbor set @xmath51 of the site @xmath48 . following common practice  @xcite , the payoff matrices have rescaled forms for pdg and sg respectively , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . + in evolutionary games",

    ", it introduces bounded rationality to individual s decision making .",
    "in what follows , we present our investigations to the two social dilemmas played by individuals occupying the vertices of the sampled social network .",
    "the evolution of the frequency of cooperators as a function of the parameter @xmath59 for pdg and @xmath41 for sg is obtained .",
    "besides , we also observe the time evolution of cooperators under different values of @xmath59 ( @xmath41 ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we report the frequency of cooperators @xmath61 as a function of temptation to defect @xmath59 in pdg .",
    "it is clear that @xmath61 nontrivially decreases with increasing @xmath59 .",
    "note that the cooperation level @xmath61 is not as remarkable as that in model scale - free network [ barabsi - albert ( ba ) ] , especially for small @xmath59 . nonetheless , the cooperators can survive for the entire range of @xmath59 ( @xmath53 ) , avoiding dying out , when confronted with the intense invasion of advantaged defectors .",
    "replicator dynamics in well - mixed population points out defection is the only evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) in pdg .",
    "hence cooperators will be wiped out by natural selection in well - mixed populations .",
    "in fact , interactions in real - world are heterogeneous , in the sense that different individuals have different numbers of average neighbors with whom they interact with , a feature associated with a power - law dependence of the degree distribution .",
    "previous study on model ba scale - free network , which captures the real - world heterogeneity , found that scale - free networks provide a unifying framework for emergence of cooperation  @xcite . here , our empirical study also provides a convincing evidence that degree heterogeneity is one of the factors promoting cooperation in realistic social networks .",

    "[ fig4 ] . for small @xmath59 near one ,",
    "starting from 50% cooperators , cooperators dominate the populations .",
    "when @xmath59 increases , the frequency of cooperation is diminished in a manner that cooperation level drop rapidly down at first , after generations and generations , the frequency of cooperation struggles to recover to a higher level ( see panels ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) . for large @xmath59 near two , although defectors prevail in the networked populations , cooperators still can survive in such tough environment ( about 10% on average ) .     in pdg.[fig3],width=377 ]     in pdg .",

    "@xmath66 , ( b ) @xmath67 , ( c ) @xmath68 , ( d ) @xmath69.[fig6],width=377 ]    in parallel , the evolution of cooperation as a function of cost - to - benefit ratio @xmath41 of mutual cooperation for sg is presented in fig",
    ".  [ fig5 ] .",
    "in well - mixed scenario , replicator dynamics of the sg converges to an equilibrium frequency for cooperators given by @xmath70 , corresponding to the red straight line as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . except for small value @xmath41 near zero , the cooperation level on our empirical social network is higher than that in the well - mixed situation .",
    "thus cooperation is enhanced in our case . generally speaking , because our social network incorporates various features , including heterogeneity , of which effects to cooperation are additive , the cooperation level is not promoted as much as in model ba scale - free networks where the cooperation level is mainly affected by heterogeneity . and also , we investigated the time evolution of cooperation for sg , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . for small value of @xmath41",
    ", the population frequently evolves into an absorbing state of full cooperators when starting from an equal percentage of cooperators and defectors [ see fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "as @xmath71 , the frequency of cooperators decreases from 50% quickly , and oscillates around the dynamic equilibrium state .    moreover , fraction of runs which ended with full cooperators vs. @xmath59 for pdg and @xmath41 for sg is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for each value of @xmath59 and @xmath41 , we ran 100 independent simulations , starting from @xmath72 cooperators .",
    "we found that , for @xmath73 in pdg and @xmath74 in sg , the networked population evolves into absorbing state of full cooperators with a probability around 50% .",
    "in this situation , except for some individual runs ending up with full cooperators , others ended up with low frequency of cooperation on occasion as a result of the different initial distributions of cooperators and defectors among the population .",
    "however , when @xmath75 for pdg and @xmath76 for sg , most of the runs ended up with massive defectors which resulted in the low frequency of cooperation .",
    "accordingly , even though the network structure promotes cooperation , its positive influence to the evolution of cooperation is to some extent suppressed by the increasing parameters @xmath59 and @xmath41 .",
    "on the other hand , together with heterogeneity , other factors including average connectivity  @xcite , small - world effect  @xcite , degree - degree correlation  @xcite , randomness in topology  @xcite , etc , play crucial roles in the evolution of cooperation . rather than investigations on model networks where only one or few features of real - world relationships are present ,",
    "the evolution of cooperation on the empirical social networks , which possess a variety of features in topological organizations , should be understood from a _ synthesis _ view . in our case , besides the scale - free feature , the online social network has small - world property , hierarchical organizations and disassortative mixing pattern .",
    "concerning small - world property of the underlying network , the short average distance promotes the propagation process of cooperators . furthermore",
    ", taking account for the hierarchical organizations [ due to @xmath15 s dependence on @xmath14 ] , i.e. , local well - clustered low - degree nodes , such common cluster structure induces the clustering of cooperators , leading to the surviving and enhancement of cooperation  @xcite .",
    "the mixing pattern also influences the cooperation level substantially .",
    "it is thought that the cooperation level is optimum in uncorrelated networks ( where the assortativity coefficient is zero )  @xcite .",
    "our sampled network is a disassortative one ( assortativity coefficient is @xmath78 ) , thus the frequency of cooperators is diminished in a way by such mixing pattern . finally , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , maximum cooperation level occurs at intermediate average degree , in our case , the average connectivity of the sampled network is about @xmath79 . to a certain extent , this quantity of average connectivity affects the evolution of cooperation .",
    "consequently , the evolution of cooperation on the empirical network is simultaneously affected by these additive factors as the underlying network possesses various characteristics of real - world social interactions .",
    "actually , the combined network effects of these factors facilitate and maintain the cooperation among selfish individuals .",
    "our results may shed light on the evolution of cooperation in social and economical systems .",
    "( @xmath41 ) for pdg ( sg ) . for each value of @xmath59 ( @xmath41 )",
    ", we ran @xmath80 simulations , starting from @xmath72 cooperators.[fig7],width=377 ]",
    "in conclusion , we have studied two social dilemmas  pdg and sg in an online social network .",
    "we demonstrated that the social network has small - world property and is scale - free in degree distribution .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the underlying network has hierarchical organizations in which low - degree vertices are well - connected in different communities , while large - degree nodes are linked to many nodes that may belong to different groups .",
    "we also found that the social network shows disassortative mixing pattern .",
    "then we investigated the evolution of cooperation on such empirical social network , observing the time evolution of frequency of cooperators for evolutionary pdg and sg respectively .",
    "the underlying network structure leads to the enhancement and maintenance of cooperation in unrelated and selfish individuals .",
    "besides , with not too large @xmath73 for pdg and @xmath74 for sg , the networked population evolves into the absorbing state of full cooperators at a probability around half one . otherwise , most of the runs ended up with massive defectors .",
    "different from games on model networks , understanding the evolution of cooperation on empirical network should be conducted from a synthesis view because real - world relational networks incorporate various characteristics while model networks generally focus on some specified features .",
    "thus , we conclude that the evolution of cooperation on the empirical network is jointly affected by additive network effects , including average connectivity , small - world property , degree heterogeneity ( scale - free ) , degree - degree correlation , hierarchical organizations , etc",
