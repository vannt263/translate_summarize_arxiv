    "of the nonlinear excitations , ion - acoustic solitary waves ( iasws ) are of the most important and well - understood characteristics of plasma environments . theoretical studies of main properties of these solitary structures date back to 1961 using sagdeev pseud - potentials method @xcite .",
    "another method which is widely used to investigate the collective wave phenomenon in plasma is the so - called multi - scales perturbation method @xcite .",
    "however , the latter method , which is based on approximation , is used only for the small - amplitude treatment of plasma in a state away from thermodynamic equilibrium . therefore to obtain a good agreement with experiments , in this method , one needs to take higher - orders in perturbation amplitudes . in recent years",
    "there have been many investigations on solitary iasws as well as solitary electrostatic waves ( esws ) in diverse plasma environments using sagdeev pseudo - potential approach @xcite . the small amplitude propagation and interaction of iasws with relativistic degeneracy pressure effects",
    "have been recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    among different kinds ,",
    "pair - plasmas have attracted special attention in recent years , a special cases of which can be electron - positron ( ep ) and electron - positron - ion ( epi ) @xcite plasmas .",
    "electron - positron - ion plasma exists in places such as active galactic nuclei @xcite , pulsar magnetospheres @xcite and in many dense astronomical environments , namely , neutron stars and white dwarfs @xcite and may play a key role in understanding the beginning and evolution of our entire universe @xcite .",
    "this kind of plasma may also be practically produced in laboratories @xcite .",
    "more specifically when positrons , due to their significant lifetimes , are used to probe particle transport in tokamaks , two component electron - ion ( e - i ) plasma behaves as three component ( e - p - i ) plasma @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the wave properties such as stabilities of a two component electron - ion ( ei ) plasma solitary excitations may be radically altered by inclusion of low amounts of positrons .",
    "owing to their wide applicabilities in micro- and nano - electronic miniaturization , dense - plasmas is becoming one of the interesting fields of theoretical as well as experimental fields of plasma research @xcite .",
    "dense plasma or the so - called quantum plasma are characterized by high densities and low temperatures , however , a dense plasma may be realized in such hot places as planet interiors and white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "more recently , quantum hydrodynamics model has been applied to study the electron - hole dynamics in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the quantum effects in collective behavior of a plasma system becomes important when the inter - particle distances are comparable or less than the de broglie thermal wavelength @xmath0 or equivalently when the thermal energies of plasma species are less than fermi - energies @xcite . in such cases the plasma becomes degenerate , in which the plasma ingredients are under effective influence of pauli exclusion principle and classical statistical assumptions break down .",
    "quantum effects also play important role in the nonlinear processes of white - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "for instance , for a cold neutron star the densities can be as high as @xmath1 in the core , which is several times the density of an atomic nuclei .",
    "in extreme conditions such as the middle of a supernova or the core of a massive white dwarf the densities can be even catastrophically higher . at these very high densities",
    "the electrons and positrons may become ultra - relativistic giving rise to the collapse of star under its giant gravitational force @xcite .",
    "the present study is devoted to investigation of propagation of iasws in an unmagnetized epi plasma using sagdeev pseudo - potential method in such extreme condition , taking into account the relativistic degeneracy effects for electrons and positrons .",
    "the basic normalized plasma equations are introduced in section [ equations ] .",
    "nonlinear arbitrary - amplitude solution is derived in section [ sagdeev ] .",
    "section [ small amplitude theory ] devotes to short argument about small amplitude iasws . numerical analysis and discussion",
    "is given in section [ discussion ] and final remarks are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "consider a dense plasma consisting of electrons , positrons and positive - ions .",
    "also , suppose that the electrons and positrons follow the zero - temperature fermi - gas statistics , while , ions behave as classical fluid .",
    "in such plasma electrons and positrons may be considered collision - less due to fermi - blocking process caused by pauli exclusion principle .",
    "therefore , the semi - classical description of nonlinear dynamics and interaction of waves in such plasma can be studied in the framework of conventional hydrodynamics model .",
    "the basic normalized equations describing plasma dynamical state may be written as @xmath2 where , electrons and positrons are of thomas - fermi type @xmath3 in obtaining the normalized set of equations following scalings are used @xmath4 where , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are characteristic plasma - frequency and electron fermi - speed , respectively , and @xmath7 denotes the equilibrium electrons density ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the electron linear fermi - momentum ) . in a fully degenerate fermi gas one may write the electron degeneracy pressure in the following general form @xcite @xmath10,\\ ] ] where , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are plank constant and light - speed , respectively , and @xmath13 is the normalized relativity parameter . the electron number density can then be defined in terms of the relativity parameter ( @xmath14 ) . it is noted that in the limits of very small and very large values of the relativity parameter we obtain @xmath15 therefore , in a three - dimensional _ non - relativistic _ zero - temperature fermi - gas for degenerate electrons and positrons from standard definitions we obtain @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) or @xmath18 , which follows that @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "three - dimensional _ ultra - relativistic _ fermi - gas , we have @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "it is noted that in our model the inertial ions are always non - relativistic , hence , the non - relativistic hydrodynamics equation has been used in eqs .",
    "( [ normal ] ) .",
    "therefore , the poisson equation reads as @xmath22 at the equilibrium situation the overall neutrality condition gives rise to the following relation @xmath23",
    "in this section we derive an appropriate sagdeev pseudo - potential describing the dynamics of arbitrary - amplitude iaws in plasma containing classical heavy positive ions and inertial - less relativistic or non - relativistic thomas - fermi electrons and positrons , obeying the three - dimensional distributions in eqs .",
    "( [ thomas ] ) .",
    "using one - dimensional version of eqs .",
    "( [ normal ] ) , in a reduced coordinate @xmath24 ( m being mach number which is a measure of soliton speed relative to ion - sound speed ) , from continuity and momentum equations we obtain @xmath25 where , we have used the fact that @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "now , substituting eq .",
    "( [ ni ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ thomas ] ) in poisson s equation in eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) , multiplying by @xmath30 and integrating with boundary conditions @xmath31 for @xmath32 , we derive @xmath33 where , the sagdeev pseudo - potential @xmath34 reads as @xmath35 + \\frac{{2\\alpha } } { { 5\\sigma_f } } \\left [ { 1 - { { ( 1 - \\sigma_f \\phi ) } ^{5/2 } } } \\right ] + { m^2}\\beta \\left [ { 1 - \\sqrt { 1 - \\frac{{2\\phi } } { { { m^2 } } } } } \\right].\\ ] ] for the reality of @xmath36 to be ensured we must have @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the possibility of iaws , therefore , require that @xmath39 it is further required that a @xmath40 exists such that @xmath41 and for every @xmath42 then @xmath43 .",
    "let us consider the small - amplitude limit in the above analysis .",
    "expanding the potential @xmath34 in ( [ sagdeev eq ] ) near @xmath44 , we obtain @xmath45 where , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are computed from eq .",
    "( [ sagdeev eq ] ) as    @xmath48    @xmath49    inserting into eq([energy ] ) and integrating , we obtain ( provided that @xmath50 ) a solitary solution in the form ( see @xcite )    @xmath51    this pulse profile is identical to the soliton solution of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation , which is obtained by use of the reductive perturbation method , for example see @xcite . it is important to notice that the soliton width @xmath52 and amplitude @xmath53 satisfy @xmath54 , as known from the kdv theory .",
    "as it was pointed out in section [ sagdeev ] , the ion - acoustic solitary waves ( iasws ) exist if the sagdeev pseudo - potential satisfies the following conditions : ( i ) @xmath55 , which reveals that the fixed point @xmath56 is unstable ; ( ii ) @xmath57 , where , @xmath40 is the maximum value of @xmath58 ; and ( iii ) @xmath59 when @xmath60 .    noticing these conditions , fig .",
    "( 1a ) and fig .",
    "( 1b ) show the areas in @xmath61-@xmath62 plane , where : namely , ia solitary waves can exist for non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic electron - positron degeneracy , respectively .",
    "it is remarked that , the minimum values of mach number , @xmath61 , decreases as the fractional positron to electron number - density ratio , @xmath62 , increases for ultra - relativistic case ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . nevertheless , the minimum values of @xmath61 increases and reaches to a given maximum value then decreases as @xmath62 increases ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . on the other hand , the maximum value of @xmath61 increases as @xmath62 increases up to the value @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) for non - relativistic ( ultra - relativistic ) case .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath61 decreases as @xmath62 increases in the range @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) for non - relativistic ( ultra - relativistic ) case .    comparing fig .",
    "( 1a ) and fig .",
    "( 1b ) reveals that both supersonic and subsonic iasws can propagate in ultra - relativistic case , whereas , only subsonic propagations can occur for non - relativistic case .",
    "although both of supersonic and subsonic iasws can propagate in ultra - relativistic degeneracy case , however , the former exist only for very small range of @xmath62 , for approximately , @xmath67 . for @xmath68 i.e. , in the absence of ions ,",
    "@xmath34 does not depend on mach number , @xmath61 .",
    "this case corresponds to the solution of poisson equation .    in fig .",
    "( 1c ) and fig .",
    "( 1d ) , we have numerically analyzed the sagdeev potential ( eq .",
    "( [ sagdeev ] ) ) and investigated the effects of allowed values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 on the profile of the potential - well for both cases of non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic degeneracy .",
    "it is remarked that for fixed @xmath62 ( @xmath61 ) value , the increase of much number @xmath61 ( @xmath62 values ) gives rise to an increase of both the potential depth and amplitude",
    ". the energy equation eq .",
    "( 9 ) has been numerically solved for some values of @xmath62 and @xmath61 .",
    "the potential pulse profiles has been depicted in figs .",
    "( 2a-2c ) .",
    "it is obvious that the potential profile becomes taller and narrower by increasing @xmath62 and @xmath61 for both types of non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic degeneracy , which is in agreement with above result .",
    "also , we note that higher pulses are narrower , while shorter are wider , in agreement with the existing soliton phenomenology .",
    "another important result is that the amplitude of pulse in non - relativistic case is higher than ultra - relativistic one for fixed values of @xmath62 and @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) . finally , we note that rarefactive iasws do not exist for both of non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic degeneracy cases .",
    "the sagdeev - potential approach was used to investigate the propagation of ion - acoustic solitary waves ( iasws ) in electron - positron - ion plasma with ultra - relativistic or non - relativistic degenerate electrons and positrons .",
    "the matching criteria of existence of such solitary wave were numerically investigated for both cases of ultra - relativistic or non - relativistic degenerate electrons and positrons .",
    "it is remarked that the characteristics of nonlinear iasw propagation differ in the mentioned cases .",
    "both supersonic and subsonic iasws can propagate in ultra - relativistic case , whereas , only subsonic propagations can occur for non - relativistic case .",
    "only compressive iasws can propagate in both of desired non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic degenerate plasmas .",
    "also , it was concluded that , the differences tend to amplify by moving towards smaller values of fractional positron - to - electron number - density @xmath62 . in this work",
    "we consider cold ions and the effects of warm ions on iasws in such plasmas can be investigated in future .",
