    "we consider the problem of eliciting an expert s opinion ( or a group of experts opinions ) about an uncertain mean and variance for a population of independent and identically distributed random variables @xmath0 .",
    "we suppose that either the population distribution is normal , or that a transformation can be applied so that the expert is willing to accept a normal distribution for the population , and we write @xmath1 so that the aim is to obtain the expert s probability distribution for @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ".    an obvious application would be in bayesian inference for the parameters of a normal distribution , though in many cases the available data would dominate any reasonable prior , and the effort in obtaining expert prior knowledge may not be worthwhile .",
    "there are , however , various scenarios when little or even no data would be available , and the prior distribution plays an important / essential role .",
    "we defer discussion of these to the next section .    typically , elicitation methods involving asking experts to make judgements about observable quantities , rather than parameters in statistical models .",
    "however , we believe experts would be willing to make judgements directly about an uncertain measure of location such as a mean or median , and generic techniques for eliciting beliefs about a scalar quantity would normally suffice , for example , the bisection method described in @xcite , pp161 - 168 .",
    "see also @xcite , chapter 6 .",
    "we would not expect experts to be willing to make direct judgements about an uncertain population variance , as this is a more abstract quantity .",
    "the challenge is then to design elicitation questions about observable quantities , that can be used to infer an expert s beliefs about an uncertain variance .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there has been little work on eliciting beliefs about variances .",
    "one existing approach that can be used is based on eliciting beliefs about parameters in linear regression models . @xcite and @xcite consider elicitation for the parameters in models of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 . by setting @xmath6 for all @xmath7 , this reduces to our case .",
    "@xcite proposed an elicitation method for quantifying opinions about the parameters of a multivariate normal distribution ; the same elicitation method could be used for quantifying beliefs about a univariate normally distributed population .",
    "a key feature of these methods is asking the expert to update his or her judgements in light of given hypothetical data , under the assumption that the expert updates his or her beliefs using bayes theorem .",
    "we think this is a difficult task : the expert may not view hypothetical data as credible and behave the same way had he / she observed real data , and it is unlikely that the expert would weight prior knowledge and hypothetical data precisely according to bayes theorem in any case .",
    "the expert may be insensitive to the sample size , for example in accounting for the variability in a sample mean @xcite .",
    "we think it desirable to have alternative elicitation methods available to the expert .",
    "@xcite and @xcite infer judgements about the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 from judgements about the observable quantities @xmath8 , by eliciting summaries from the expert s predictive distribution .",
    "for example , suppose we wish to elicit an expert s opinion about the variance parameter @xmath3 of a random variable @xmath9 that follows a normal distribution with a known mean @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath3 is not directly observable then the expert is asked to make judgements about the observable quantity @xmath9 , and we infer @xmath10 from these judgements .",
    "any choice of @xmath10 implies a distribution @xmath11 and we suppose that a particular choice of @xmath10 will result in the above integral ( approximately ) matching the expert s beliefs about @xmath9 , so that this choice of @xmath10 describes the expert s underlying beliefs about @xmath3 .",
    "a concern here is whether an expert really is able to account for his or her uncertainty about @xmath3 when making judgements about @xmath9 .",
    "a possibility is that the expert instead only makes judgements about @xmath9 conditional on some estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite use conjugate priors for @xmath2 and @xmath3 which force the expert s opinion about the two parameters to be dependent .",
    "however , it is possible in reality that knowledge of one parameter would not change the expert s opinion about the other .",
    "@xcite argued that , unless mathematical tractability is required , then it can be better to assume independence between the two parameters , and that this helps the expert focus on the assessments of each parameter separately .",
    "they proposed an elicitation method for the multivariate normal distribution where the mean vector and covariance matrix are assumed to be independent , though their method also asks the expert to update his or her judgements in the light of hypothetical data .",
    "we argue that the better informed the expert , the less likely a judgement of dependence between the two parameters would be required .",
    "for example , consider the distribution of running times for an individual over a distance of 5 km . with no information about the ability of the runner",
    ", one might have considerable uncertainty about the mean , e.g.  an interval of 15 minutes to 1 hour may be judged plausible , with smaller variances of running times associated with smaller means within this interval .",
    "but if one already has ` expert ' knowledge about the particular runner s ability , a much smaller interval may be judged plausible for the mean , and one s beliefs about the variance may not change appreciably given different plausible means .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new elicitation method for quantifying opinions about an uncertain population mean and variance .",
    "our method does not elicit judgements using hypothetical data and bayes theorem , it does not use predictive elicitation and it assumes independence between the mean and variance .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss some motivating applications where the prior distributions will be important . in section",
    "[ sec : families ] we discuss the choice of prior families of distributions for the uncertain mean and variance . in section [",
    "sec : method ] , we present a detailed procedure of eliciting judgements using our proposed elicitation method . in section [ sec",
    ": example ] , we present a real elicitation example to illustrate the use of our proposed method in practice .",
    "various authors have proposed a bayesian alternative to a power calculation in the design of clinical trials , in which a prior distribution is elicited for a treatment effect , and then the unconditional probability of a ` successful trial ' ( e.g. rejection of a null hypothesis as required by a regulator ) is calculated via an integral of the power function with respect to the elicited prior @xcite .",
    "power functions typically depend on population variances of patient responses , and hence a prior distribution for this variance required .",
    "note that the main role of this prior is in the design stage : the calculation of the unconditional probability of a successful trial _ before _",
    "the data have been observed ( and this calculation may assume that the trial data will be analysed using a frequentist approach ) .",
    "@xcite considered uncertain variances , but did not propose or use formal elicitation methods .",
    "a common scenario in a meta - analysis is that we have a number of studies , each of which has attempted to estimate the effect of some ` treatment ' in a randomised controlled experiment , and the aim is to synthesise the data from all the studies to infer an overall treatment effect . often , unobserved differences in the study populations cause the treatment effects to vary between studies , and this is typically handled by modelling the treatment effects as random effects , drawn from some distribution .",
    "although sample sizes within studies may be large , the number of studies can be small , so that there is very little information in the data about the population variance of treatment effects , and the prior distribution for this variance plays an important role .",
    "there is some discussion of priors for variances of random effects in @xcite , section 5.7.3 , including some informal elicitation approaches when the treatment effect is measured as a log odds ratio .      in a risk analysis",
    ", a decision - maker may have to make decisions based on expert opinion only ( see , for example , the discussion of the role of expert judgement in food safety risk assessment in * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , a risk analysis may need to consider both aleatory uncertainty caused by variability within a population , and epistemic uncertainty about the extent of this variability .",
    "for example , @xcite analyse the risk of contamination of farm - pasteurised milk contamination with vero - cytotoxigenic e.coli o157 .",
    "their analysis involves the use of a mechanistic model with various uncertain inputs .",
    "one input describes the amount of faecal contamination in bulk tank per milking , and was informed by expert judgement only .",
    "this is a quantify that would vary from one milking to the next , but the distribution of amounts of contamination would be uncertain .",
    "the risk analysis may involve the use of a mechanistic model of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath9 has a population distribution @xmath13 , with @xmath14 uncertain .",
    "given an elicited distribution for @xmath14 , analysis can proceed with a ` 2d ' or ` second - order ' monte carlo simulation ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : a @xmath15 pair is sampled from its distribution , and then a sample @xmath16 from @xmath13 is propagated through @xmath17 to obtain a sample @xmath18 .",
    "one can then examine how the distribution of model outputs changes as function of @xmath14 , and hence explore both the effects of aleatory uncertainty within the population , and epistemic uncertainty about the population distribution parameters .",
    "the decision - maker may consider reducing uncertainty about @xmath14 if this source of uncertainty appears relatively important .",
    "in this paper , we suppose that the expert s uncertainty about @xmath2 can be represented by a normal distribution @xmath19 and that her uncertainty about @xmath3 can be represented by an inverse gamma distribution which we write as @xmath20 with density function , @xmath21 these are similar to the choices in @xcite , except that their prior for @xmath2 was of the form @xmath22 . in some cases , alternative families of distributions may be needed for @xmath2 , and we discuss this further in section [ sec : transform ] .",
    "the ` shelf ` r package will fit either a gamma distribution or a lognormal distribution to the population precision @xmath23 , though it would be difficult to claim any single choice of family as ` optimal ' at this stage .",
    "after the expert has provided judgements and distributions have been fitted , we can use feedback to test whether these assumptions are acceptable to the expert ; feedback is provided at several stages in our proposed method .",
    "for simplicity and ease of exposition , it is supposed that there is one female expert , and that the elicitation is conducted by a male facilitator .",
    "there are , of course , various general considerations when performing elicitation such as training of the experts , and how to manage ( or combine opinions from ) multiple experts .",
    "the focus of this paper is solely on how to elicit judgements about a mean and variance , and we do not consider these other issues here .",
    "guidance on these and other aspects of elicitation can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first ask the expert to provide a lower plausible bound @xmath24 and an upper plausible bound @xmath25 for a member of the population @xmath8 .",
    "she is told that @xmath26 is assumed . though we are assuming a normal distribution for the population , limits will still be needed when plotting density functions etc .  to provide graphical feedback .",
    "providing _ two _ bounds may also reduce the effect of the _ anchoring and adjusting _ heuristic : making a judgement by starting from an additional value , the anchor , and then making a , potentially insufficent , adjustment @xcite as the expert can not use multiple anchors simultaneously .",
    "the expert is asked to provide at least two quantiles ( denoted as @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) of her distribution of @xmath2 such that @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . @xcite",
    "suggest eliciting lower and upper tertiles , and calibration studies tend to find performance worsens as more extreme quantiles are elicited @xcite .",
    "however , in our experience , experts may find moderate quantiles harder to judge , and so there can be a trade - off between aiming for the best calibration performance , and asking the experts questions that they are comfortable answering .",
    "we tend towards the latter , given that a population mean is a more abstract quantity than an individual observable population member . in our example , we elicited the 5th and 95th percentiles of the expert s distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "if we denote the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution by @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 and so we choose values for @xmath34 and @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36 the facilitator then feeds back different summaries of the fitted distribution , including showing the density function of n(@xmath37 ) .",
    "the expert may make adjustments until she is satisfied that the fitted distribution is a reasonable representation of her opinion about @xmath2 .      to elicit the expert s judgements about the population variance ,",
    "she is asked to suppose that the population mean is known to be @xmath38 , her median value from the previous step .",
    "this is simply to enable the expert to consider uncertainty about the population variance in isolation ; she is not required to update her beliefs ( in any case , we are assuming independence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "there remains a concern when providing hypothetical data : the expert may think differently if she had _ actually observed _ @xmath39 , but as @xmath38 could be thought of as her ` best guess ' , she at least is not having to condition on a value of @xmath2 she considers implausible .    the expert is now asked to consider the proportion @xmath40 ( or percentage if she prefers ) of the population @xmath0 that would lie in the interval @xmath41 $ ] , for some @xmath42 ( we consider the choice of @xmath43 in the next section ) .",
    "the expert will be uncertain about this proportion , because she is uncertain about @xmath3 .",
    "to illustrate this idea , suppose we wish to elicit an expert s beliefs about end - of - year students marks for an undergraduate statistics module , for a large population of students .",
    "suppose the marks are normally distributed with a mean of 60 .",
    "then there is a true proportion of students who will get marks between 60 and 70 .",
    "if this expert is certain this proportion will be less that 0.45 and more than 0.25 , this would imply she is certain @xmath44 is between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : shaded - proportion ] .",

    "hence the expert is asked for the 5th and 95th percentiles of the population proportion , which we denote by @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , and these are described to the expert as approximate lower and upper limits .",
    "it may help the expert to explicitly consider the two intervals @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] and consider how the population is distributed between these two intervals .",
    "for example , for an appropriate choice of @xmath43 , she might judge a split of 2%-48% across the two intervals highly unlikely , which can help prompt judgements of more plausible allocations ( though the facilitator should remain cautious of anchoring effects ) .",
    "if the expert prefers to report judgements on the 0 - 1 scale rather than the 0 - 0.5 scale , she could instead be asked to consider the proportion in @xmath41 $ ] , out of those known to be greater than @xmath38 .",
    "the facilitator uses the expert s judgements @xmath50 and @xmath51 to infer the corresponding quantiles of her distribution for the variance , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "the facilitator chooses @xmath57 and @xmath58 to be @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the cdf of the ig distribution .",
    "the minimisation can not be done analytically so numerical optimisation is applied .",
    "the expert would may find it hard to visualise her judgements from the fitted ig distribution since @xmath3 is not directly observable .",
    "therefore , we suggest showing the expert two density plots of the population distribution with a fixed mean and the two calculated quantiles of the variance , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the expert visualises the variation in the distribution of @xmath8 based on her judgements about @xmath40 , and then confirms whether the fitted ig distribution is a reasonable representation of her opinion about @xmath3 .    to summarise , the expert is asked to make six judgements , as set out in table [ tab : elicited - questions ] .",
    ".the elicitation questions with the corresponding notation . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the feedback was given in the form of a cdf plot of @xmath63 as explained earlier .",
    "for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we sample @xmath66 from n@xmath67 and @xmath68 from ig@xmath69 .",
    "we calculate @xmath70 for @xmath71 evenly spaced between 5 and 70 , and we set @xmath72 .    the expert was asked to consider the 5th quantile of the population distribution , interpreted as the 5th quickest page to translate assuming a book with 100 pages .",
    "the fitted 90% interval for the 5th quickest page was ( 12 minutes , 23 minutes ) .",
    "he was also asked to consider the 95th quantile of the population distribution : the 5th slowest page to translate assuming a book with 100 pages .",
    "the fitted 90% interval for the 5th quickest page was ( 47 minutes , 58 minutes ) . given the fitted intervals , the expert chose to alter his judgements : he thought the times in the interval for the 5th quickest page were too long .",
    "he modified his elicited values until he was satisfied with the feedback , obtaining @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the facilitator obtaining @xmath75 .",
    "the expert then agreed that the fitted population distribution was a reasonable representation of his judgements about the population distribution , and the elicitation session was concluded .",
    "we have proposed a novel method for eliciting beliefs about a population mean and variance , with the main novelty in how beliefs about a variance are elicited .",
    "the method avoids asking the expert to update his or her beliefs given hypothetical data , or to provide summaries from the predictive distribution which would require ` mentally integrating out ' the uncertain parameters .",
    "the elicitation tasks are still likely to be difficult for the expert , but we think some difficulty is unavoidable ; considering one s uncertainty about population variability is always likely to be hard .    in our case study , we were able to obtain a distribution that was satisfactory to the expert , after a process of feedback in which the expert was able to challenge some of the fitted probability judgements , suggesting the expert was able to ` take ownership ' of the elicited distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the task was not easy for the expert , and several practice elicitations were needed first until the expert was comfortable with the procedure .",
    "code for the implementing the method is available as part of the r package ` shelf ` , which enables the facilitator to provide feedback to the expert in real time",
    ". we will continue to develop this , and welcome suggestions for improvements from users .",
