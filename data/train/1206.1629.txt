    "star formation is one of the most important processes driving the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the presence or absence of significant star formation is one of the key characteristics which distinguishes spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "the intense bursts of star formation triggered by galaxy interactions and mergers produce some of the most luminous galaxies in the local universe @xcite . at high redshift , many galaxies are seen to be forming stars at rates which far exceed those of all but the most extreme local mergers @xcite . since stars form from gas , specifically from molecular gas , understanding the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is critical to understanding the rate and regulation of star formation in galaxies @xcite .    at the most basic level , the amount of gas in a galaxy is an important constraint on the amount of star formation the galaxy can sustain @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that it is the amount of molecular gas that is most important , rather than the total gas content @xcite .",
    "this picture is consistent with galactic studies which show that stars form exclusively in molecular clouds , and most commonly in the densest regions of those clouds @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the properties of the molecular gas , in particular its average density and perhaps the fraction of gas above a critical density on sub - parsec scales , are likely to affect the resulting star formation .",
    "star formation in turn can affect the properties of the dense gas , by increasing its temperature @xcite and perhaps by triggering a subsequent generation of stars @xcite .",
    "unusual environments are also likely to affect both the gas properties and the star formation process .",
    "high shear in galactic bars , harassment in a dense galaxy cluster , and galaxy mergers and interactions have the potential to either dampen or enhance the star formation process .",
    "the wide range of environmental processes at work , both on galactic and extragalactic scales , implies that large samples of galaxies are required to tease out the most important effects , while high resolution is required to isolate individual star forming regions , separate arm from interarm regions , and resolve galactic bars .",
    "there have been a number of large surveys of the atomic gas content of nearby galaxies , of which some of the most recent include the hi nearby galaxy survey , things @xcite , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey , alfalfa @xcite , and the vla imaging of virgo spirals in atomic gas survey , viva @xcite .",
    "however , only the 34 galaxies in the things and the 53 galaxies in the viva sample have sufficient spatial resolution to probe scales of one kiloparsec and below . compared to the hi 21 cm line , the co lines used to trace molecular gas are relatively more difficult to observe due to their shorter wavelengths and the smaller field of view of millimeter - wave radio telescopes equipped with single pixel detectors . as a result ,",
    "most co extragalactic surveys have sampled a relatively small region at the center of each galaxy @xcite .",
    "two recent surveys @xcite have used array receivers to observe large unbiased regions , although still in relatively small ( 18 and 40 ) samples of galaxies . finally , dust continuum observations in the submillimeter to far - infrared present an alternative method of tracing the molecular gas that requires a mostly independent set of physical parameters , such as dust emissivity , gas - to - dust mass ratio , and the atomic gas mass @xcite .",
    "two large surveys have been made at 850 @xmath1 m , one of an infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) selected sample @xcite and one of an optically selected sample @xcite .",
    "the galaxies selected for these samples were relatively distant ( @xmath2 mpc ) and thus primarily global measurements of the dust luminosity were obtained .",
    "the herschel reference survey @xcite is observing 323 galaxies with distances between 15 and 25 mpc at 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath1 m and has significant overlap with the sample presented here .",
    "other herschel surveys which overlap with the ngls sample include the key insights on nearby galaxies : a far - infrared survey with herschel @xcite and the herschel virgo cluster survey @xcite .",
    "using the dust continuum to measure the star forming gas is a promising avenue to explore , especially since this method is one that can in principle be used for galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "taking advantage of new instrumentation for both spectral line and continuum data on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , we are carrying out the nearby galaxies legacy survey ( ngls ) , a large survey of 155 nearby galaxies using the co j=3 - 2 line and continuum observations at 850 and 450 @xmath1 m .",
    "the survey is designed to address four broad scientific goals .    1 .   _ physical properties of dust in galaxies .",
    "_ the continuum data from this survey will probe a range of the dust spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that is critical to determining the total mass of dust as well as the relative proportion and physical properties of the different dust components ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , very small grains , large grains ) .",
    "most importantly , these long wavelength data will trace any excess submillimetre emission that causes an upturn in the dust sed .",
    "the submillimetre excess could originate from : dust with @xmath310 k temperatures @xcite ; very small grains with shallow dust emissivities that are not prominent in the dust sed between 60 and 500 @xmath1 m @xcite ; large dust grains with enhanced dust emissivities at @xmath4850 @xmath1 m @xcite ; or spinning dust grains @xcite .",
    "2 .   _ molecular gas properties and the gas to dust ratio . _ our high - resolution data will allow us to compare the radial profiles of the dust , hi , and co emission within our well - selected sample .",
    "the co j=3 - 2 line will effectively trace the warmer , denser molecular gas that is more directly involved in star formation @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the co j=1 - 0 line also traces more diffuse and low density gas @xcite . with observations of all three components of the ism ( molecular gas , atomic gas , and dust )",
    ", we will be able to determine accurate gas - to - dust mass ratios and provide constraints on the variation of the co - to - h@xmath5 conversion factor @xmath6 @xcite by fitting the data @xcite .",
    "the effect of galaxy morphology .",
    "_ the larger - scale galaxy environment can play a significant role in the properties and structure of the dense ism .",
    "for example , an increase in the density in the ism in the centers of spiral galaxies has been attributed to an increased pressure @xcite .",
    "elliptical galaxies have relatively low column densities of gas and dust @xcite combined with an intense radiation field dominated by older , low - mass stars and , in some cases , substantial x - ray halos .",
    "early - type galaxies also show more compact and symmetric distributions of dust at @xmath7 @xmath1 m compared to late - type galaxies @xcite . in spiral galaxies",
    ", dust and gas properties may differ between arm and inter - arm regions @xcite , while the role of spiral arms in the star formation process is the subject of considerable debate @xcite . with observations across the full range of galaxy morphologies and with sub - kiloparsec resolution",
    ", we will be able to study the effect of morphology on the molecular gas properties .",
    "the impact of unusual environments .",
    "_ metallicity has been shown to affect the structural properties of the ism @xcite .",
    "lower self - shielding is expected to produce smaller regions of cold , dense gas that can be traced by co emission with relatively larger and warmer photon - dominated regions @xcite .",
    "galaxies residing in rich clusters can be affected by ram pressure stripping @xcite and gravitational harassment @xcite which reduces their ism content relative to field galaxies .",
    "the halos of spiral galaxies can be populated with gas via superwinds or tidal interactions @xcite or even by relatively normal rates of star formation @xcite . with its galaxies spanning the full range of environment , from isolated galaxies to small groups to the dense environment of the virgo cluster",
    ", the ngls will be able to quantify the effect of environment on the molecular ism in galaxies .",
    "most surveys of molecular gas in our own or other nearby galaxies have used the ground state co j=1 - 0 line as a tracer .",
    "the choice of the co j=3 - 2 line for the ngls was driven by the available instrumentation at the jcmt .",
    "compared to the co j=1 - 0 line , ( 5.5 k above ground with a critical density of @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , the co j=3 - 2 line ( 33 k and @xmath10 @xmath9 ) traces relatively warmer and denser gas .",
    "( since both lines are usually optically thick , the effective critical density is likely reduced by a factor of 10 or more . )",
    "there is growing evidence that the co j=3 - 2 emission correlates more tightly with the star formation rate or star formation efficiency than does the co j=1 - 0 line @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the co j=3 - 2 emission correlates linearly with star formation rate derived from extinction - corrected h@xmath11 emission and that the correlation was tighter with the j=3 - 2 line than with the j=1 - 0 line .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that the co j=3 - 2 emission correlates nearly linearly with the far - infrared luminosity for a sample of local luminous infrared galaxies and high redshift submillimeter galaxies .",
    "thus , it is appears that the co j=3 - 2 emission is preferentially tracing the molecular gas associated directly with star formation , such as high - density gas that is forming stars or warm gas heated by star formation , rather than the total molecular gas content of a galaxy .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the ngls sample selection , the co j=3 - 2 observations and data reduction , and the planned observing strategy for continuum 450 and 850 @xmath1 m observations (  [ sec - obs ] ) . in   [ sec - disc ] , we present the co j=3 - 2 integrated intensity images , as well as maps of the velocity field and velocity dispersion for those galaxies with sufficiently strong signal . in ",
    "[ sec - comp ] , we examine the molecular and atomic gas masses for the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) sample @xcite and compare the co j=3 - 2 luminosity with the far - infrared luminosity for both the galaxies in the sings sample , local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies , and high redshift quasars and submillimeter galaxies which have also been observed in the co j=3 - 2 transition @xcite . we give our conclusions in  [ sec - concl ] .",
    "previous papers in this series have examined individual or small samples of galaxies @xcite .",
    "future papers will exploit the spatially resolved nature of these data by examining the co line ratios and excitation ( rosolowsky et al . in prep . ) and the gas depletion times ( sinukoff et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "the galaxies in the ngls are an hi - flux selected sample .",
    "this selection method was chosen to avoid biasing the survey towards galaxies with higher star formation rates , as might be the case for far - infrared or blue magnitude selection criteria , while still targeting galaxies with a significant interstellar medium , as might not be the case for a purely mass selected sample , e.g. @xcite .",
    "our sample should also not be unduly biased by dust content being either particularly hot or cold , and should be reasonably representative of the local submillimetre universe .",
    "hi emission typically extends to much a larger radius than co or stellar emission , so that our sample may include galaxies that are hi - rich but h@xmath5-poor .    to obtain good spatial resolution",
    "while still being able to obtain sensitive maps in a reasonable period of time , the galaxies were selected to have distances between 2 and 25 mpc .",
    "this distance limit excludes galaxies in the local group but does include galaxies in the virgo cluster , which allows us to test the effect of cluster environment on the dense ism .",
    "we used the hyperleda data base in february 2005 to extract all non - virgo galaxies ( see below ) with hi fluxes @xmath12 jy km s@xmath13 and virgo - corrected galactocentric velocities",
    "@xmath14 km s@xmath13 . out to these limits ,",
    "the hyperleda database is essentially complete .",
    "we removed galaxies with declinations below -25@xmath15 ; we further removed galaxies with galactic latitudes between -25@xmath15 and 25@xmath15 to minimize the impact of galactic cirrus in complementary data from spitzer and herschel .",
    "virgo cluster member galaxies were selected to be galaxies within an @xmath16 ellipse centered on m87 ( ra=12.4h , dec=12.4@xmath15 ) and with velocities between 500 and 2500 km s@xmath13 , e.g. @xcite ; all virgo galaxies with an hi flux entry were included in this initial selection .",
    "these selection criteria gave us a sample of 1002 field galaxies and 148 virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "since we estimated that at least 1500 hours of telescope time would be required to observe this complete sample of 1150 galaxies , we needed to apply further selection criteria .",
    "we first selected all the sings galaxies @xcite that met our declination and galactic latitude criteria ; the wealth of complementary data available on these galaxies from the sings and other surveys @xcite make them natural targets .",
    "forty - seven sings galaxies met our criteria ( tables  [ tbl - large ] and  [ tbl - small ] ) .",
    "two sings galaxies , ngc 5194 ( m51 ) and ngc 4789a ( ddo 154 ) , were observed in separate programs and were not re - observed as part of our survey ; we present maps made from those data in this paper .",
    "we then estimated the minimum size of the field and virgo cluster samples that would allow us to achieve the scientific goals of this study .",
    "for statistical studies of galaxy properties , we want to divide the galaxies into 4 morphological bins ( e / s0 , early - type spirals , late - type spirals , and irregulars ) .",
    "in addition , we want to compare the properties of galaxies in the virgo cluster to those in the field .",
    "we estimated that 18 galaxies per bin were required to obtain good statistics on the average properties of each bin , or 144 galaxies total .",
    "however , since our sample only contains 148 virgo galaxies , we compromised on 9 galaxies per bin in virgo and 18 per bin in the field , giving a sample size of 108 galaxies .",
    "in addition , we limited the field and virgo samples to galaxies with @xmath17 so that we could use the jiggle - map mode with harp - b @xcite and still map the inner quarter of each galaxy .    to select the final sample , the field and virgo lists were each divided into the four morphological bins described above using the numerical hubble stage , @xmath18 ( e / s0 : @xmath19 ; early - type spirals : @xmath20 ; late - type spirals : @xmath21 ; irregulars : @xmath22 ) . for the field samples , we first applied an hi flux cutoff of 6.3 jy km s@xmath13 and then randomly selected 18 galaxies in each of the four morphological bins ( for the elliptical galaxies , there were precisely 18 galaxies above this cutoff ) .",
    "the smaller virgo sample meant that we could only use this same process for the late - type spiral bin . the brightest 9 in each category of e / s0 ( @xmath23 jy km",
    "s@xmath13 ) , irr ( @xmath24 jy km",
    "s@xmath13 ) , and early - type spiral galaxies",
    "( @xmath25 jy",
    "km s@xmath13 ) from virgo were included , in addition to a random selection of 9 late - type spirals with hi fluxes brighter than 6.3 jy km s@xmath13 .",
    "the final field and virgo source lists are given in tables  [ tbl - field]-[tbl - virgo ] in appendix  [ members ] .",

    "both the jiggle and raster mapping modes used in this survey make use of a shared `` off '' position in order to increase the mapping efficiency . for the jiggle observations ,",
