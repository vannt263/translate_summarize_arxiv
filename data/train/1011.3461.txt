    "recent years have seen rapidly growing interest in astrophysical applications of fingering convection ( often referred to as `` thermohaline convection '' ) , a process by which the unequal diffusion rates of thermal and compositional fields can drive a double - diffusive instability and lead to significant turbulent transport across stably - stratified regions . in the earth s oceans this process has been well - studied as `` salt fingering '' ( see @xcite , or a recent review in @xcite ) . in stellar contexts , by contrast , its exact form and contribution to vertical mixing is much less clear .",
    "nevertheless , fingering convection has been invoked in various scenarios .",
    "it is thought to explain the lack of observed metallicity signatures from the infall of planets onto their host star @xcite .",
    "it may also explain the presence of extra mixing in the radiative zones of rgb stars needed to fit abundance observations @xcite .",
    "while field , laboratory , and numerical measurements abound for salt fingering , data is much more scarce for the astrophysical regime .",
    "transport by fingering convection in astrophysics has until now been modeled through mixing - length theory , commonly used parameterizations being those of @xcite and @xcite . in these works ,",
    "turbulent compositional transport depends sensitively on the finger aspect ratio . as recently shown by @xcite",
    ", however , there is a fundamental contradiction between the large aspect ratio required to explain abundance observations of rgb stars using these prescriptions @xcite , and the near - unit aspect ratio of the `` fingers '' actually measured in his own two - dimensional simulations .",
    "three possibilities emerge to resolve this problem .",
    "first , the @xcite and @xcite parameterizations may not adequately model transport by fingering convection .",
    "secondly , two - dimensional simulations may not correctly capture the true dynamics of this inherently three - dimensional system .",
    "finally , thermocompositional layers may form in the astrophysical objects studied , in which case transport could be strongly enhanced above the level of homogeneous fingering convection .",
    "indeed , `` staircases '' of convectively mixed layers separated by thin fingering interfaces are ubiquitous in the ocean . in their presence , vertical mixing increases by as much as an order of magnitude above the already - enhanced mixing due to fingering @xcite . whether such staircases form in astrophysics has never been established .    in this letter",
    "we consider all three possibilities and present the first three - dimensional simulations to address directly the question of thermal and compositional transport by fingering convection in astrophysics . using a high - performance algorithm specifically designed for homogeneous fingering convection , we are able to run simulations at moderately low values of the prandtl number ( @xmath0 ) and diffusivity ratio ( @xmath1 ) , where @xmath2 is viscosity , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the thermal and compositional diffusivities respectively .",
    "we find , in section [ subsec : smallflux ] , asymptotic scaling laws for transport which are applicable to the stellar parameter regime ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these provide a parameter - free , empirically - motivated prescription for mixing by homogeneous fingering convection .",
    "the compositional turbulent diffusivity derived is , as expected @xcite a few times larger than that obtained by @xcite for the same parameters , but remains too small to account for rgb abundance observations .",
    "since the presence of thermocompositional staircases is known to increase transport in the ocean , we next address the question of whether such staircases are likely to form spontaneously in the astrophysical context , in section [ subsec : layers ] . applying a recently - validated theory for staircase formation @xcite , we find that they are in fact not expected to appear in this case .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] that our small - scale flux laws can reliably be used to estimate heat and compositional transport for a variety of astrophysical fingering systems and concur with denissenkov s view that fingering convection is not sufficient to explain the required extra mixing in rgb stars .",
    "the dynamics of double - diffusive systems depend on the fluid properties ( @xmath6 ) , as well as its local stratification , measured by @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the adiabatic gradient ) and @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 ) . here",
    "@xmath12 is temperature , @xmath13 is pressure , and @xmath14 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "the fingering instability occurs in thermally stably - stratified systems ( @xmath15 ) destabilized by an adverse compositional gradient ( @xmath16 ) . in most regimes of interest",
    "the main governing parameter is the density ratio , defined in astrophysics as @xcite : @xmath17 this linear instability is well understood , thanks to early work in the oceanic context @xcite , later extended in astrophysics by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a system is ledoux - unstable when @xmath18 , and fingering - unstable when @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , the nonlinear saturation of this instability , or in other words its turbulent properties , remain poorly understood .",
    "we approach the problem from a numerical point of view , and model a fingering - unstable region using a local cartesian frame @xmath20 with gravity @xmath21 .",
    "we run our numerical experiments using a high - performance spectral code , which was recently used to model three - dimensional fingering convection at oceanic parameters @xcite , as well as thermohaline staircase formation @xcite . as a consequence of its original purpose ,",
    "our code uses the boussinesq approximation , which relates the density perturbations @xmath22 to the temperature and compositional perturbations @xmath23 and @xmath24 via @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a reference density , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "fingering convection is driven by constant large - scale temperature and compositional gradients @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ". these approximations , which greatly simplify the governing equations , are nevertheless justified since fingers are typically much smaller than a pressure or density scale height , and velocities are small compared with the sound speed . as first shown by @xcite , results in the boussinesq case can straightforwardly be extended to the astrophysical case by replacing the boussinesq density ratio @xmath31 with the true density ratio @xmath32 defined in equation ( [ eq : density_ratio ] ) .",
    "we now describe the governing equations in more detail .",
    "we express the velocity , temperature , and composition fields as the linear background stratification plus perturbations , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we nondimensionalize the system noting that an appropriate length scale is provided by the anticipated finger width @xcite , @xmath36=d=(\\kappa_t\\nu / g\\alpha t_{0z})^{1/4}$ ] .",
    "we then scale time using @xmath37 , temperature with @xmath38 , and composition with @xmath39 .",
    "the nondimensional governing equations are : @xmath40 note that the rayleigh number ra then depends only on the computational domain height @xmath41 : @xmath42    we solve ( [ eq : momentum][eq : composition ] ) in a triply - periodic box of size @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 and similarly for @xmath45 , @xmath24 and @xmath46 .",
    "six sets of simulations were conducted at successively lower values of pr and @xmath47 , for a range of density ratio values listed in table [ table_simsets ] spanning in each case the instability range @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the statistical properties of fingering convection are independent of the computational domain size ( i.e.  of ra and aspect ratio ) provided it is wide enough to contain a sufficient number of fingers .",
    "the domain must also be tall enough to ensure that individual fingers do not span the entire height of the box . in most cases , the simulation domains were @xmath49 with a resolution of @xmath50 grid points . at the selected parameter values , this corresponds to approximately @xmath51 wavelengths of the fastest - growing mode ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus allowing space for many fingers to fit in the domain . as @xmath52 , where fingers tend to become more vertically elongated , wider and taller simulation domains ( @xmath53 ) were used to ensure that fingers remained uncorrelated across the box height . in sets 5 and 6 (",
    "the two lowest - diffusivity runs ) , lower finger heights allowed for shorter computational boxes ( @xmath54 ) but a higher resolution ( @xmath55 grid points ) was used to resolve the finer - scale structures . near @xmath56 , where the system dynamics are most turbulent , one additional simulation with twice the vertical resolution ( 192 or 384 points vertically ) was run for each set . in all cases , the measured fluxes in the more fully - resolved run differed by no more than a few percent from the lower - resolution run , confirming that the spatial resolution used was sufficient to extract accurate fluxes .",
    "sample snapshots of two of our simulations are shown in figure [ finger_renders ] . as an important note",
    ", we also find that , except when @xmath52 , the finger aspect ratio is close to unity @xcite .",
    "we define non - dimensional heat and compositional fluxes through the nusselt numbers @xmath57 and @xmath58 , ratios of the total flux to the diffusive flux of the field considered .",
    "equivalently , @xmath59 represents the ratio of the turbulent diffusivity to the microscopic diffusivity .",
    "we measure @xmath57 and @xmath58 from each simulation once the system has settled into a statistically - steady state .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig_nu_fits ] .",
    "for ease of comparison between different simulation sets , we defined the rescaled density ratio as @xmath60 so that the instability range is @xmath61 $ ] in all cases .",
    "we find that _ all simulation sets collapse onto a single universal profile _ for the turbulent fluxes @xmath62 and @xmath63 as pr and @xmath47 decrease , profiles which can be expressed as @xmath64 where the universal functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 are adequately fitted to the data using @xmath67 for @xmath65 the data suggests that @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and for @xmath66 we find @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ fig_nu_fits ] shows these fits together with the rescaled nusselt numbers .",
    "the physical interpretation of these scalings with @xmath47 and pr is the following : for @xmath73 , the instability is driven by the compositional field and the dependence of compositional transport on @xmath3 must drop out .",
    "the turbulent compositional diffusivity @xmath74 is then proportional to the geometric mean of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the scaling for the temperature nusselt number then follows by assuming that the nondimensional turbulent flux ratio @xmath75 is always @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "although these simulations were conducted at parameter values a few orders of magnitude higher than those appropriate for stellar interiors , we find that they follow universal asymptotic laws .",
    "the simplicity of the system considered ( e.g. no boundaries ) also suggests that these laws _ can _ reliably be extrapolated to the astrophysical regime ( as long as pr is of order @xmath47 ) . from this",
    "we draw two critical observations . as found by @xcite ,",
    "the contribution of fingering convection to heat transport at stellar parameter values ( @xmath77 ) is entirely negligible .",
    "it therefore does not affect the thermal structure of the object in any way .",
    "compositional transport , on the other hand , can be significantly enhanced above molecular diffusion , by about two orders of magnitude depending on the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "we now compare our flux laws with the parameterization of @xcite and @xcite , in which @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the aspect ratio of the fingers ( length @xmath81 divided by width @xmath82 ) and @xmath83 is a model constant ( @xmath84 for @xcite , @xmath85 for @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mixing ] compares @xmath86 as a function of density ratio , at the fluid parameters used by @xcite , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "given that the numerically - determined finger aspect ratio is close to one for all simulations as @xmath89 , @xmath90 , we find that the @xcite prescription fares comparatively better than @xcite . however , it still vastly overestimates mixing both near @xmath56 ( where the system is closest to ledoux instability ) and @xmath91 , close to linear stability . crucially , our results show that the diffusivity obtained is not sufficient to explain rgb abundance observations for which a value of @xmath92 is needed @xcite .",
    "the small - scale flux laws presented above are accurate measurements of transport by _ homogeneous _ fingering convection .",
    "however , they may not appropriately describe transport in the presence of the kind of large - scale thermocompositional staircases which are known to form in oceanic thermohaline convection ( _ e.g. _   * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of such staircases has recently been discovered by @xcite , who demonstrated the existence of a positive feedback mechanism that can , in some circumstances , drive the growth of horizontally - invariant perturbations in the temperature and salinity fields : large - scale variations of the density ratio lead to convergences and divergences of fingering fluxes that reinforce the original perturbation , producing a growing disturbance that ultimately overturns into regular `` steps . ''",
    "this mechanism relies fundamentally on the variation of the flux ratio @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 is the turbulent heat flux and @xmath95 is the turbulent salt flux ) with density ratio , and was therefore called the @xmath96-instability .",
    "the @xmath96-instability mechanism accurately predicts the growth rate of large - scale perturbations , and subsequent overturning into layers , in both two - dimensional simulations @xcite , and three - dimensional simulations of staircase formation @xcite .",
    "the instability requires that @xmath96 decreases as @xmath97 increases , a condition which must be experimentally determined from the fluxes for each set of fluid parameters pr and @xmath47 .    in radko s original formulation for oceanic staircases ,",
    "the systems of interest were dominated by turbulent fluxes .",
    "diffusive contributions to the total fluxes were neglected for convenience and simplicity .",
    "however , as shown in section [ subsec : smallflux ] , turbulent heat transport is negligible in the astrophysical case , so the @xmath96-instability theory is re - derived here including all diffusive terms for accuracy and completeness .",
    "we begin with the equations of section [ sec : model ] and average them over many fingers : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 now represent averaged large - scale fields . on",
    "the right - hand sides appear the usual reynolds stress term , @xmath100 , and the turbulent fluxes @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "we proceed as in earlier formulations @xcite by making several simplifying assumptions , the first being that reynolds stresses are small enough to neglect and the second being that the turbulent fluxes are dominated by their vertical component , so that @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath96-instability involves only the temperature and compositional fields , so we consider only zero - velocity perturbations and discard the momentum equation .",
    "we then define the total fluxes as well as their ratio : @xmath105 so that the thermal and compositional nusselt numbers are : @xmath106 the final assumption is that @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath107 depend only on the local value of the density ratio @xmath108 .",
    "note that @xmath109 and may vary with @xmath110 .",
    "we now linearize equations ( [ eq : mean_temperature ] ) and ( [ eq : mean_composition ] ) around a state of homogeneous turbulent convection in which @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "for example , linearizing the density ratio @xmath108 , we have : @xmath114 } , \\nonumber \\\\   & \\approx & r_0(1 + \\partial t'/\\partial z - r_0 \\partial \\mu'/\\partial z ) .",
    "\\label{r0_linear}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the temperature equation yields @xmath115 and similarly for equation ( [ eq : mean_composition ] ) . assuming normal modes of the form @xmath116 , equations ( [ t_linear ] ) and the equivalent linearization of ( [ eq : mean_composition ] ) combine into the quadratic @xmath117 - k^4 a_1{\\rm    nu}_{0}^2 r_0 = 0 , \\label{eq : quadratic}\\ ] ] where we use the following notation for simplicity : @xmath118 note that this is identical to the quadratic of @xcite replacing @xmath96 by @xmath107 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , a sufficient condition for the instability is that @xmath107 is a decreasing function of density ratio . indeed , when this is the case",
    ", the coefficient @xmath119 is positive , and the expression ( [ eq : quadratic ] ) has two real roots , one positive and one negative . in order to determine whether the @xmath96-instability occurs and therefore whether staircases may spontaneously form at low pr , low @xmath47",
    ", we simply need to calculate @xmath107 from our previous measurements .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : gammatot ] .",
