    "in recent years , inclusive and exclusive @xmath1 and @xmath12 charge exchange reactions at intermediate energies have been proven to be excellent probes for investigating the @xmath5 dynamics in nuclei .",
    "the most important observation of the inclusive charge exchange reactions is the downward energy shift of the @xmath5 resonance peak position by @xmath13 mev in nuclear targets ( with mass number @xmath14 ) as compared to the proton target @xcite .",
    "microscopic @xmath5hole model calculations show that a large part of this shift is caused by the attractive @xmath5nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction in the spin  longitudinal ( lo ) channel @xcite .",
    "a direct signature of this interaction is provided by the measurement of the coherent pion decay spectrum where the pion of the @xmath5 resonance decay is measured in coincidence with the ejectile while the target nucleus is left in its ground state @xcite .",
    "these coherent pions couple strongly to the lo channel . due to the attractive @xmath4 potential in this channel ,",
    "their energy spectrum is substantially shifted downwards relative to the @xmath5 resonance peak position of the inclusive reaction .    in this paper",
    "we study the @xmath5 excitation in the deuteron target using the @xmath0h@xmath1 charge exchange reaction at @xmath15=790 mev .",
    "the deuteron has the advantage that its wave function is well known and that the fermi motion of the @xmath4 system can be treated properly .",
    "therefore the effects of the @xmath4 interaction can be studied in a more direct way than in heavier nuclei . in the past",
    "most of the studies on the deuteron have been carried out with electromagnetic and hadronic probes , such as in photon ",
    "deuteron ( @xmath16 ) and pion  deuteron ( @xmath17 ) scattering , leading to @xmath18 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 final reaction channels . in these reactions",
    "the intermediate @xmath4 interaction plays an important role @xcite .",
    "the photon excites the @xmath5 dominantly with spin  transverse ( tr ) coupling , i. e. by the transition operator @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the spin and isospin transition operators , respectively ) , while the pion excites it with spin  longitudinal ( @xmath23 coupling .",
    "both couplings are orthogonal to each other and therefore give different information on the @xmath4 interaction . in the charge exchange reactions the target",
    "is exposed to the virtual @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson fields produced by the @xmath1 projectile  ejectile system .",
    "the pion  like interaction excites the lo response function ( @xmath24 coupling ) of the target while the @xmath7meson  like interaction excites the tr response function ( @xmath25 coupling ) . due to the kinematics , the virtual meson fields obey the energy ",
    "momentum relation @xmath26 and thus explore the lo and tr response functions in an @xmath27 region which is inaccessible to real pion and real photon scattering .    in the interpretation of the ( @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath17 ) scattering reactions ,",
    "various theoretical models have been applied to treat the @xmath4 dynamics . among these models are the coupled channel approach @xcite and the three  body faddeev treatment of the @xmath19 system @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we make use of a coupled channel approach to describe the @xmath4 system in a non  relativistic framework .",
    "we set up a system of coupled equations for the @xmath4 wave function in configuration space .",
    "we then apply the lanczos method for solving the equations .",
    "the @xmath4 potential is constructed within a meson  exchange model .",
    "the exchanged mesons taken into account are the pion ( @xmath6 ) , the rho ( @xmath7 ) , the omega ( @xmath8 ) , and the sigma ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that the @xmath1 reaction at forward scattering angles is an interesting tool to study the @xmath4 interaction in the deuteron .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath1 reaction over other probes is twofold : first , at forward scattering angles the quasi ",
    "elastic peak cross section and the @xmath5 resonance peak cross section are energetically well separated .",
    "the @xmath5 resonance cross section is very large as compared to the quasi ",
    "elastic cross section providing a well  defined @xmath5 resonance peak in the spectrum .",
    "second , the @xmath5 resonance cross section involves both a lo and tr component ( with a ratio of lo / tr = 1/2 ) and thus allows to examine the complete spin structure of the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "the lo excitation is of special interest for the coherent pion decay of the @xmath4 system . due to the lo spin structure in both the excitation and de ",
    "excitation process the cross section for coherent pion production becomes relative large . because the @xmath4 interaction is most attractive in the lo channel , the coherent pion spectrum",
    "is expected to clearly exhibit the effects of the @xmath4 potential .",
    "it turns out , indeed , that both the peak energy and the magnitude of the coherent pion production cross section depend quite sensitively on the strength of this potential .",
    "other observables , such as the inclusive cross section , the quasifree @xmath5 decay cross section , and the two  nucleon breakup , are also shown to be influenced by the dynamical treatment of the @xmath5 degrees of freedom .",
    "the organization of the present paper is at follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give a detailed account of the formulation and methods of calculation used in the analysis of the data .",
    "first we present the coupled channel approach and show how to calculate the correlated @xmath4 wave function in a very efficient way with the lanczos method .",
    "then we split the inclusive cross section into its various partial cross sections , as there are the contributions of coherent pion production , quasifree @xmath5 decay , and two  nucleon breakup . in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the parameters used in our model .",
    "we present the results of the cross section calculations and compare them to experimental data @xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "4 we give a summary and conclusions .",
    "we are interested here in the calculation of the inclusive and exclusive cross sections for the @xmath0h@xmath1 charge exchange reaction in the @xmath5 resonance energy region .",
    "since we shall deal with high projectile energies ( @xmath28 mev ) , we assume that the cross sections can be calculated within the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) . because of the transparency of the deuteron target it is sufficient to calculate the distortion effects within the eikonal approximation .",
    "we start our formulation by writing down the formula for the inclusive @xmath0h@xmath1 cross section . using relativistic kinematics ,",
    "this cross section is given as @xmath29 here the indices @xmath30 and @xmath31 refer to the proton projectile ( neutron ejectile ) and the deuteron target , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 is the total energy of the final state on the target side , i.e. of all outgoing particles except the neutron ejectile .",
    "momentum of the final state is fixed by momentum and energy conservation while an integration over the relative momenta has to be performed .",
    "in addition , an average over the initial spin orientations and a sum over the final spin orientations of both the projectile and the target spin states are taken .",
    "the transition amplitude will be evaluated in the breit frame ( bf ) of the target system , where the deuteron state is well described by the usual nonrelativistic wave function .",
    "since we want to compare our results with experimental data where the energy and the scattering angle of the outgoing neutron have been measured , we have to calculate the double differential cross section @xmath33 in the laboratory frame ( lab ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we obtain @xmath34 in the following , cross section results will always be given in the laboratory system while every other unlabeled quantity refers to the breit frame .      in this section",
    "we discuss the excitation processes which contribute to @xmath0h@xmath1 in impulse approximation . in our model ,",
    "there are two relevant feynman diagrams for this case which are shown in fig .",

    "[ app:1 ] .",
    "they provide a spin  longitudinal ( pion  like ) and a spin  transverse ( @xmath7meson  like ) excitation component .",
    "the excitation strength parameters are fitted to reproduce the experimental cross section and the spin observables for @xmath1 reactions on a nucleon target .",
    "since the effective @xmath48 is adjusted to experiment , we implicitly account for knockout exchange effects between the projectile and the target nucleons .",
    "note , however , that we neglect the projectile @xmath5 excitation process where the detected neutron comes from the decay of the @xmath5 . for forward neutron angles ,",

    "in the following we shall demonstrate that almost all of the cross section in the dip  region is spin  transverse ( tr ) while the spin  longitudinal ( lo ) cross section is relatively small .",

    "[ fig6 ] together with the theoretical results .",
    "the measured lo cross section is reproduced very well by our calculation . on the other hand ,",

    "we could not reproduce this result .",
    "since there are many other possible meson exchange currents which have not been considered for the @xmath0h@xmath1 reaction so far , the dip  region puzzle remains a problem to be solved .",
    "the theoretical description of the experimental @xmath0h@xmath1 spectra at higher scattering angles is of the same quality as for zero degree scattering .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where we compare the theoretical @xmath0h@xmath1 cross section with data at @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively . at the low energy side of the @xmath5 ,",

    "we now discuss the influence of the @xmath4 interaction on the three partial contributions ( qf , cp , bu ) to the cross section . as we will demonstrate , the coherent pion production is most sensitive to @xmath164 .",
    "this sensitivity is a combined effect of the attractive pion exchange , the spin ",
    "longitudinal @xmath205 coupling and the structure of the deuteron wave function . in the following discussion",
    ", we will focus on the exclusive @xmath0h@xmath10h spectra first .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , theoretical results for the exclusive @xmath0h@xmath10h cross section are shown .",
    "the calculation without inclusion of the @xmath4 interaction ( i.e. @xmath206 ) is compared with a calculation where only the @xmath6 meson contribution to @xmath164 was taken into account .",
    "the effects of the direct and the exchange part of the @xmath6 mediated interaction are also examined separately .",
    "obviously both parts are of equal importance which may be surprising at first regard .",
    "it is true that because of the smallness of the @xmath207 coupling constant , the direct part should be suppressed by a factor of @xmath208 as compared to the exchange part , but in the @xmath209 channel of the @xmath4 system which is relevant here , the spin ",
    "isospin matrix elements turn out to be larger by approximately the same amount .",
    "therefore it is essential to include both the direct and the exchange contribution in the @xmath4 interaction . in the case of the @xmath6 exchange",
    ", the interference effect of both contributions leads to a very strong attraction between the @xmath5 and the second target nucleon .",
    "the result is a shift of the cross section peak position downwards in energy ( by @xmath210 mev , cp .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "most of the attraction is caused by the tensor part of the @xmath6 whereas the central part is less important for the peak position but influences the overall magnitude of the result .    by including not only the @xmath6 , but also the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 mesons in @xmath164",
    ", we obtain the results presented in fig .",
    "it can be seen that both the peak position and the magnitude of the exclusive @xmath0h@xmath10h cross section depend quite sensitively on the specific form of the @xmath4 potential . in comparison to the result with only @xmath6 exchange",
    ", the inclusion of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the @xmath4 interaction leads to a less attractive potential and hence to a smaller shift of the peak position .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the partial cancelation of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 tensor forces which have opposite sign .",
    "for the direct part of the interaction , the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 meson cause an additional short range repulsion and a medium range attraction , respectively , which leads to an additional enhancement of the cross section .",
    "the final result for the @xmath0h@xmath10h spectrum ( i.e. the result with inclusion of @xmath211 in @xmath178 ) is quite different from the spectator approximation ( i.e. the result with @xmath206 ) .",
    "most remarkable is the shift of the peak position downwards in energy by about 30 mev . as discussed above ,",
    "the main reason for this shift is the attractive pion exchange , i.e.  the attractive lo part of the @xmath4 potential .",
    "the amount of the peak shift is directly related to the interaction strength of @xmath164 .",
    "this result attracts further interest because there is no comparable peak shift due to @xmath164 for the quasifree @xmath5 decay cross section and also not for the deuteron breakup .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the results with and without inclusion of @xmath164 for the coherent pion production ( cp ) , the quasifree @xmath5 decay ( qf ) and the deuteron breakup ( bu ) . in both the qf and the bu channel ,",
    "the cross section is slightly enlarged and broadened due to the @xmath4 interaction , but there is no significant shift of the peak position .    in order to understand this different behavior , we perform a multipole decomposition of the partial cross sections and split them into two contributions corresponding to unnatural parity ( up ) states ( @xmath212 ) of the @xmath5n system and to natural parity ( np ) states ( @xmath213 ) , respectively .",
    "for the three reaction channels under consideration , this decomposition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . for each case , the full calculation is compared with the spectator approximation .",
    "one recognizes that the cross section contributions of the up states are always lowered in excitation energy by the @xmath4 interaction while the np states are not .",
    "this is explained by the fact that there is a strong coupling of the pion to the up ( pion  like ) states but just a weak coupling to the np states .",
    "therefore only the up states are substantially influenced by the attraction of the lo part of @xmath178 .",
    "for the coherent pion production , the spectrum is clearly dominated by the up states .",
    "this is an effect of the lo spin structure of the de  excitation process and of the deuteron wave function ( which selects spin @xmath214 and orbital momentum @xmath215 ) in the final state .    for the quasifree @xmath5 decay ,",
    "the final deuteron state is replaced by a final unbound @xmath18 state .",
    "since the two outgoing nucleons are free , we have no particular spin selection rule in the de  excitation process for this case and thus all partial waves can contribute . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , the np states become more important for the qf decay , and the overall energy shift more or less disappears . for the @xmath168 breakup",
    ", the @xmath159 transition potential @xmath169 provides not only a lo but also a tr component .",
    "the energy shift of the up states is compensated by a relative large enhancement of the np states which results from tr excitation . moreover ,",
    "the p  wave rescattering interferes with the quasi  elastic scattering which has no intermediate @xmath4 configuration , hence the effects of @xmath164 are partially smeared out .    to complete the discussion about the influence of the @xmath4 interaction , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] the contributions of three characteristical @xmath4 partial waves to the exclusive @xmath0h@xmath10h cross section .",
    "all selected partial waves have unnatural parity and therefore couple strongly to the pion .",
    "the spectrum is absolutely dominated by the @xmath216 partial wave of the @xmath4 system .",
    "because the @xmath5 and the nucleon have relative angular momentum zero in this case , there is no centrifugal barrier in the potential and the attraction becomes largest .",
    "that accounts for the strong energy shift in this partial wave .",
    "the partial waves with higher angular momentum @xmath217 are subjected to a less attractive potential due to the centrifugal barrier and therefore do not exhibit such a lowering in the excitation energy . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , the @xmath218 partial wave is only enhanced but not shifted due to @xmath164 . for the @xmath219 partial wave ,",
    "the potential has a minor effect and even gets repulsive .",
    "compared to @xmath216 , the higher partial waves are by far less important which results in the surviving of the downwards energy shift in the full spectrum .    we conclude that neither the qf nor the bu process shows the same sensitivity to the lo channel as the cp process .",
    "therefore only the exclusive @xmath0h@xmath10h spectrum clearly exhibits a lowering of the @xmath5 excitation energy .",
    "this fact makes the coherent pion production most suitable to examine the effects of the @xmath4 interaction .      in this section",
    ", we present our results for the angular distribution of the coherently produced pions . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , the triple differential cross section @xmath220 of the exclusive @xmath0h@xmath10h reaction is plotted as a function of @xmath221 which is the angle between the outgoing @xmath170 and the three ",

    "the energy transfer was chosen to be @xmath222 mev and the neutron scattering angle is @xmath194 .",

    "this cross section contribution is proportional to @xmath227 and thus vanishes at @xmath228 .",
    "we would like to mention that the angular distribution of the lo component is very similar to that of the pion elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "in fact , one may view the coherent pion production as a kind of elastic scattering process , in which an initially off  mass  shell pion with the momentum @xmath110 is converted into an on  mass  shell pion by the multiple scattering in the deuteron .",
    "this conversion process is possible because the deuteron as a whole can provide the extra recoil momentum needed to put the pion on its mass shell .",

    "this factor vanishes for @xmath226 and peaks for @xmath231 .",
    "the additional angular dependent factors as discussed before lead to a more forward peaked distribution . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , the tr non  spin  flip component has its maximum at about @xmath232 and is zero at @xmath226 . the full tr angular distribution , however , has a different shape due to the spin ",

    "this demonstrates the importance of the second term on the r.h.s .   of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin2 ] ) which does not vanish but rather reaches its maximum at @xmath226 .",

    "this behavior of the tr component is very similar to the observed angular distribution in pion photoproduction ( @xmath233,@xmath6 ) reactions on the deuteron , see e.g.  ref .",
