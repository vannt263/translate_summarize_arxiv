    "suppose a student wishes to write a confidential email to disclose the information of a leaked out exam paper to his friend .",
    "using a secure email client the student writes down an email , sends it and logs out .",
    "the email shall be encrypted and would only be viewable by the recipient once he logs in to check the email .",
    "how can the student be sure that the email was sent securely and no one could learn anything apart from the intended recipient ?",
    "the answer relies on the weakest security link : the password .",
    "little did the student know that his computer was being key - logged @xcite .",
    "there was a hidden camera looking at the student s every move .",
    "his fellow student also shoulder surfed on the password .",
    "even if no one saw the mail being written , they could log on later to view the sent mail box .",
    "it turns out that no matter how secure the email client was , it only served its purpose until the password was not compromised .",
    "similar situation occurs when one inputs pin numbers on atms .",
    "we could use biometrics instead of passwords or pin numbers . but",
    "biometric data is only secure unless the biometric information is kept confidential and the equipment has not been tampered .",
    "so , are these mechanisms unsecure or useless ?",
    "they certainly are nt .",
    "they were designed with certain assumptions in mind : the passwords selected by the user should be truly random strings of a suitable length ; the pin numbers selected by the user should be truly random 4-digit numbers ; the user has the responsibility to hide her input from peeping eyes .",
    "it has been an interesting topic of research in cryptography to devise authentication protocols that meet the security reequirements even when the above mentioned assumptions do not hold .",
    "this highly vulnerable security environment has been termed as the `` naked human in a glass house '' model in @xcite , although the first protocol constructed to be secure in this model was by matsumoto @xcite .",
    "we shall call such protocols as `` human identification protocols '' or hips in short following the terminology in literature .",
    "a lot of human identification protocols have been proposed in literature with the goal of ease of `` human execution '' in mind .",
    "the protocols should take roughly the same amount of time as a password based protocol takes .",
    "researchers have tried to construct protocols that are secure and require little or no computation on the human s part .",
    "this indeed is a very hard goal to achieve and reflects through the fact that there are not a lot of proposed human identification protocols over the years .",
    "the situation , however , is not as bad as it seems .",
    "humans possess good cognitive abilities .",
    "we can recall a previously viewed image with a very high probability when presented to us again .",
    "we do not need to memorise all the details of the picture .",
    "this has led to the use of graphics as essential ingredients of human identification protocols .",
    "proposed identification protocols can be implemented with a graphical implementation .",
    "for example , instead of memorizing the string 00101 , we can display five pictures , each time , where the third and the fifth picture is shown to the user apriori as the user s secret pictures .",
    "we could go a step further and use the things that an image describes to build human identification protocols . in @xcite we proposed that instead of using pictures just as memory aids , we can use their internal structure in some way to construct a human identification protocol .",
    "the secret could be one of the concepts that the picture satisfies .",
    "it was conjectured that it would be hard even for a human adversary to find the secret .",
    "however , no exact quantification of this hardness was given .",
    "while the hardness of breaking the protocol is clearly evident against automated adversaries ( computer programs programmed to defeat the protocol ) , the security against `` human adversaries '' needs more attention .",
    "this study aims to enhance the work proposed in @xcite by answering some of the open problems and moves a step further in trying to quantify the hardness of the underlying problem .",
    "we address the following issues :    * we present a new protocol with the aim of generating automated instances of challenges .",
    "this construction is loosely based on the gimpy captchas @xcite and requires the server to only maintain a dictionary of words .",
    "* we analyze the security of the protocol presented in @xcite and the ones presented in this paper with a new perspective .",
    "we show how much work has to be performed by a `` human '' adversary in order to obtain the secret based on our model . *",
    "we show the interrelationship of the two `` secrets '' of the protocol presented in @xcite .",
    "* we also present another way of viewing the underlying problem of these protocols using matrix representation .",
    "this view helps to understand the principal hardness of the protocols presented . * finally , we show the results of some experiments which show the amount of information in a very simple image .",
    "this data leads us to some guidelines while selecting the secret which we have also mentioned .",
    "our study will deal with passive adversaries only .",
    "the reason being that if we deal with active adversaries in the protocols , then we might require the human user to send some random challenges to the remote server in order to authenticate it as well .",
    "this generation of random challenges requires an extra amount of computation from the human user s part , and might deem the protocols impractical .",
    "this is left as a future work .",
    "the first work on human identification dates back to @xcite . since then a lot of other schemes",
    "have been proposed in literature @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "some of them were broken in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "while most of them involve some numerical calculations like @xcite and the hb protocol@xcite , they can be implemented using some graphical interface employing pictures as memory aids .",
    "we can categorized the human identification protocols into two broad categories : protocols built to be secure against general eavesdropping adversaries and protocols secure against only `` guessing adversaries '' i.e. adversaries who do not see the user s input and hence try to guess the secret or impersonate the user without any apriori knowledge .",
    "protocols mentioned so far fall in the first category .",
    "they have a drawback , however , that they involve extra computation from the user . as an example , in the hb protocol @xcite , the user is required to compute bit - wise binary multiplication for some number of bits in every iteration .",
    "this may not seem much but to obtain a higher level of security , the number of computations increase significantly .    in the second category ,",
    "the most well known example is the traditional password based authentication system .",
    "others include purely graphical schemes like deja vu@xcite , passface @xcite , point & click @xcite and @xcite that require little or no numerical computation whatsoever .",
    "the basic theme of @xcite and @xcite is to present the user a series of pictures , a subset of which are the secret pictures .",
    "the user is authenticated if its selection of the secret pictures among the given set of pictures is correct . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "the user is authenticated if it clicks on the correct secret location in the given picture .",
    "@xcite works similarly by letting the user draw the secret symbol or figure on a display device .",
    "evidently , these purely graphical schemes are not secure against `` peeping '' attacks @xcite .",
    "anyone observing the actions of the user can find out the secret in no time .",
    "for a detailed account of all the schemes , see @xcite . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we proposed to use internal properties of images as secrets .",
    "after a secret has been chosen , pictures which satisfy the properties were presented randomly with the pictures that do not satisfy the property .",
    "the user has to answer the pictures according to the secret property .",
    "it was conjectured that finding out the secret property is a hard problem for adversaries . for automated adversaries ,",
    "this follows immediately from the definition of captchas@xcite .",
    "but for human adversaries , this hardness is difficult to prove . in this paper",
    ", we have tried to quantify this hardness and tried to answer some of the open questions described above .",
    "consider the picture of a magic square shown in figure 1 .",
    "how many things does the picture represent ?",
    "a simple glance at it can reveal a lot of things : a magic square , a square , nine small squares , digits , black , white , the digit 4 , the digit 2 , line(s ) , the right angle etc .",
    "it is amazing how much information does a rather simple looking picture contain .",
    "we call each piece of this information as a feature",
    ". we can take one of these features and construct a question out of it .",
    "for example : does the picture contain a rectangle ? .",
    "this question is shared as a secret between the server and the user .",
    "after that , a series of pictures can be presented to the user such that with probability 1/2 they satisfy the question and with probability 1/2 they do nt .",
    "the user has to scan the picture and answer ` yes ' or ` no ' accordingly . how about the adversary ?",
    "the adversary would like to know the secret feature . the best way to do it is to extract all features in the pictures presented to the user and then do intersection ( if user s answer is ` yes ' ) or difference ( if user s answer is ` no ' ) to narrow down the number of possible secret features .        from an abstract point of view",
    ", we may define a universal set of all features , all pictures could possibly have .",
    "denote this set as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total number of features .",
    "any subset of this set represents a picture .",
    "given a subset @xmath2 of this set ( which again is a picture ) and its corresponding response bit @xmath3 from the user , we would be interested in finding out how the adversary can find the hidden feature and hence the secret question .",
    "obviously , it is almost impossible to write a computer program which given a picture can filter out all the features that picture describes considering the enormous size of the set of all features .",
    "this immediately implies the need of human intervention .",
    "so , what could be the best strategy to find out the hidden feature ?",
    "one way is to have a cursory glance at the pictures and see if there is something common between the pictures . a more efficient way is to find out all the features in the pictures , and then check which features are common between the pictures .",
    "but once the features have been extracted , one could make a program that would automatically filter out the common features .",
    "thus we will only be concerned with the workload on the human adversary which amounts to finding out all the features in the pictures until a single common feature is found .",
    "our analysis will try to quantify the complexity of our proposed schemes based on the workload on human adversary using the mentioned approach .",
    "namely , given a picture @xmath2 and its corresponding answer bit @xmath3 the adversary has to flag all the features as the candidate secret features if @xmath4 or else delete all the features present in this picture from the candidate set of features if @xmath5 .",
    "thus the adversary s job is to find out the features by personally checking every picture and narrow down the set of candidate secret features . + we will now present protocols based on this main idea in the next section . each protocol follows a short discussion and a brief account of the workload on the adversary .",
    "the detailed analysis follows in section vi and vii .",
    "before we present the proposed schemes we present the general notation which will be used throughout this manuscript .",
    "we assume there to be a pool of distinct pictures @xmath6 , each element of which is denoted by @xmath7 , and a set of questions @xmath8 .",
    "each question @xmath9 has a binary answer when applied to any picture in @xmath6 .",
    "each question therefore asks whether a certain feature is present in the picture or not .",
    "we will also use @xmath9 to represent the function : @xmath10 , which represents the evaluation of a picture according to the question .",
    "the user s answer string is represented by @xmath2 , where @xmath11 represents the @xmath12th bit in the string .",
    "we will use @xmath3 to denote an arbitrary answer bit . from now",
    "onwards , the word `` adversary '' or the symbol @xmath13 would mean the `` human '' eavesdropping adversary , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the workload of @xmath13 for each protocol will be based on the complexity of the above mentioned algorithm ( or a slight variant of it ) which is described in section vi . due to a bulk of notation used in this article , we will abuse this general notation in some sections or subsections without compromising disambiguity .",
    "we have the following immediate basic scheme : + setup .",
    "the user and the server share a secret question @xmath9 from @xmath8 . + protocol .",
    "* repeat @xmath14 times * * the server picks a bit @xmath15 uniformly at random , and picks a picture @xmath7 from @xmath6 such that @xmath16 .",
    "discards this picture from the pool , and presents it to the user . * * the user submits @xmath17 . *",
    "output @xmath18 if all answer s are correct , otherwise output @xmath19    the scheme is described pictorically in figure 2 , where @xmath20 pictures are shown at each iteration .     and",
    "secret question @xmath21``does the picture contain a basketball?'',width=348,height=275 ]    we could present all @xmath14 pictures at the same time depending on whether they can be displayed on the screen or not . in anycase",
    "we can find a number @xmath22 such that we can have @xmath23 iterations in one authentication session . according to the analysis in section vi , the number of pictures the adversary has to observe to obtain the secret feature would be : @xmath24 regardless of the value of @xmath22 .",
    "this amounts to a total work of @xmath25 , which has to be done by the human adversary . setting in the values @xmath26",
    ", we get a total work of @xmath27 units .",
    "[ [ discussion - on - the - protocol ] ] discussion on the protocol + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this protocol is simple and practical .",
    "however , there is a big disadvantage .",
    "namely , the user is sending its answers in the clear .",
    "an adversary thus knows the `` correct '' answer to all the pictures shown to the user .",
    "this makes the life of the adversary a bit easier since it can have a glance at the pictures to find out the common secret feature .",
    "we would like to somehow `` hide '' the answer sequence , thus making it hard for the adversary to guess the secret feature .",
    "the next protocol attempts to do that .",
    "this protocol was the original protocol presented in @xcite .",
    "[ [ matrix - interpretation ] ] matrix interpretation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    consider the set of all features @xmath0 as described in the previous section .",
    "each picture contains a subset of this universal set of features .",
    "the secret question can also be considered as a subset of this set with a single element .",
    "we can represent the features of a presented picture @xmath12 as a vector @xmath28 with all the features not present in the picture represented by 0 s , and the secret question as @xmath29 with only one entry equal to 1 .",
    "we can then write the answer bit as @xmath30 .",
    "thus if we have more pictures , we can represent the protocol as the matrix operation : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the matrix containing row vectors @xmath33 representing the features of the picture @xmath12 , and @xmath34 is the answer vector . the obvious way to solve this requires @xmath35 pictures and corresponding answers .",
    "however , as we will see in section vi , not all pictures will contain features from the full feature space .",
    "therefore , the actual number of picture and answer pairs required would be less than that . the real difficulty of the problem , however , is to find out the features in the pictures and thus construct the correct matrix @xmath32 .",
    "our matrix representation shows one way of describing the problem needed to be solved by @xmath13 .",
    "suppose we want to present @xmath22 pictures at a time to the user .",
    "the pictures are labeled from @xmath36 to @xmath22 in sequential order .",
    "the idea is to permute the numbers randomly . out of the resulting permutation ,",
    "select @xmath37 numbers , and label the others as `` do nt care positions '' .",
    "this permutation string is also shared as a secret between the user and the server . each time",
    "a series of @xmath22 pictures are presented .",
    "the user answer s the pictures according to the order in the permutation string , and fills the `` do nt care positions '' with random bits .",
    "so , for example , if @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then a possible permutation string would be @xmath40 , where the `` @xmath41 '' represents a do nt care position .",
    "we label such a permutation string as @xmath42 .",
    "we now have two secrets in our scheme : the secret question @xmath9 and the permutation string @xmath42 .",

    ", we get a total work load of @xmath51 . which is significantly higher than the previous protocol .",
    "the adversary thus gets the secret question . but how about the secret permutation string @xmath42 ?",
    "the adversary is only successful in impersonating as the legitimate user if it knows @xmath42 .",
    "it turns out that after the secret question has been revealed , it just takes a handful of iterations to observe to guess the permutation string with high probability .",
    "we show this in section v.

    "it not only adds extra burden while answering the pictures , it also slows down the process .",
    "secondly , in the two schemes proposed , there is a big question of practicality . how to automatically generate those pictures ?",
    "we conjecture that it is hard to write a program that can extract all the features from the given features . but how about the problem of generating or finding out images satisfying a given question automatically ?",

    "one such protocol was proposed by us in @xcite and its security was based on the `` conjectured difficulty '' of obtaining the secret after observing some authentication sessions . in this paper , we have extended the work by giving some candidate alternative protocols , finding the exact harndess of these protocols in terms of the effort required by the human adversary as well as giving a detailed analysis of the protocol proposed in @xcite . a brief survey regarding the number of possible features in an image",
    "was also carried out .",
    "our results show that a practical implementation of the protocol might be feasile provided we are against a resource constrained human adversary .",
    "a notable future line of work is to device a similar protocol secure against active adversaries .",
    "this might involve sending challenges to the server by the human user similar to @xcite .",
    "however , it remains an open problem whether we can fine tune the protocols so as to make them secure against active adversaries without increasing the workload on legitimate users .",
    "another direction of future work is to come up with a different model for the distribution of features in images found on the web .",
    "this might give a close to realistic quantification of the workload on the adversary .",

    "<S> a secure human identification protocol aims at authenticating human users to a remote server when even the users inputs are not hidden from an adversary . </S>",

    "<S> the advantage being that an automated adversary is not effective in attacking the protocol without human assistance . </S>",
    "<S> this paper extends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems . </S>",
    "<S> first , we analyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the workload of a human adversary . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we propose a new construction based on textual captchas ( reverse turing tests ) in order to make the generation of automated challenges easier . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a brief experiment involving real human users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and give some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the results . finally , we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the relationship between the secrets . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that we can construct human identification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably `` quantified '' security guarantees based on our model . </S>"
