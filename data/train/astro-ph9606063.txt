    "the upper limit to the column density of ciii gives a lower limit to the ionization parameter and an upper limit to the metallicity .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath145 system for which we can only say that [ c / si ] @xmath146 gives [ c / h ] @xmath147 and that the observed civ can be reproduced only for @xmath148    for the system at @xmath141 the limits are @xmath149 and [ c / h ] @xmath150 .",
    "if we require a relative silicon abundance lower than 1 @xmath151 , the metallicity is [ c / h ] @xmath152 and @xmath153 .    in the system at @xmath154 ,",
    "the non detection of ciii implies @xmath155 and consequently [ c / h ] @xmath156 .",
    "the nitrogen relative abundance remains close to that solar",
    ".    in the system at @xmath157 , the upper limit to the ciii column density gives @xmath158 and [ c / h ] @xmath159 .",
    "the relative silicon abundance is lower than 1 @xmath151 if [ c / h ] @xmath160 . for @xmath161 [ c / h ] @xmath162 ,",
    "the relative nitrogen abundance is @xmath163 [ n / c ] @xmath164 . in the last component , at @xmath165 , @xmath158 and consequently [ c / h ] @xmath150 . from the relative silicon abundance we derive [ c / h ] @xmath166 . in this range of metallicity ,",
    "the nitrogen abundance is @xmath167 [ n / h ] @xmath168 .    as for the intervening systems , errors on the hi column densities",
    "are much larger than for metal lines and relative metal abundances do not change rescaling the hi column density according to the upper and lower limit given by the errors , while the metallicity do .    from the analysis with @xmath144 , we conclude that in the detected metal systems the metallicity is undersolar , although values lower than [ c / h ] @xmath169 are unlikely .",
    "this value is about one order of magnitude higher than that found in intervening systems at about the same redshift .",
    "a silicon overabundance seems favoured , while the nitrogen abundance tends to be undersolar .    for @xmath57 ,",
    "the values of [ c / h ] are higher with respect to the previous analysis , up to 0.2 @xmath151 for the considered lower limit in the @xmath170 and of the order of 0.6 @xmath151 for the upper limit of @xmath170 .",
    "the [ n / c ] values are slightly lower , while the silicon overabundance results much higher , being almost in all cases higher by 1 @xmath151 .    savaglio et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported slightly higher values for the metallicity of the same associated systems .",
    "the greater wavelength coverage , the better @xmath44 of the present data and the new line fitting procedure adopted , allow a more accurate estimates of the line parameters .",
    "moreover it was possible to detect new absorption lines and to infer more stringent upper limits to non  detected lines .",
    "in particular new upper limits on ciii absorptions have been used to derive upper limits on the metallicity . in this work",
    "we also used a more accurate photoionized code and we excluded the possibility of having silicon overabundances higher by 1 @xmath151 , lowering the upper limit to the metallicity .",
    "finally , we have focused our attention on those systems for which we have reliable information only .",
    "metallicities derived for associated systems in @xmath171 quasars show nearly solar values and in some cases even higher than solar ( wampler et al . 1993 ; petitjean et al . 1994 ; mller et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the lower metallicities derived for some systems at @xmath172 might be indicative of an evolution with redshift of the chemical abundances in the associated systems , which however needs confirmation with a larger sample of high quality data .",
    "we have presented a list of absorption lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar q@xmath1 ( @xmath173 ) with a resolution of 13  and a signal  to  noise ratio of @xmath174 per resolution element .",
    "the main results of the statistical analysis can be summarized as follows :    * the mode of the doppler distribution for the  lines is @xmath4  with a dispersion of 7 .",
    "the fraction of line with @xmath175  is 17% .",
    "the doppler values derived from uncontaminated  lines are smaller than those obtained from the corresponding ly@xmath6 , suggesting the contribution of non saturated , non resolved components in the  profiles .",
    "* on the basis of the proximity effect in this spectrum the integrated uv background is estimated to be @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9  hz@xmath8 sr@xmath8 , although only values of @xmath176 and @xmath177 are excluded at more than @xmath178 level .",
    "this value is consistent with previous estimates obtained at a lower @xmath10 , implying no appreciable redshift evolution of the uvb up to @xmath11 , in agreement with the absence of any gunn - peterson effect up to @xmath128 .",
    "* the analysis of the intervening metal line systems has revealed in particular the presence of three optically thin systems with @xmath13 showing associated civ and siiv absorptions . [ si / c ] ratios lower than 10 times the solar value can be obtained only assuming a large jump in the spectrum of the ionizing uv background beyond the heii edge ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this result , if confirmed in other spectra at the same redshift , is suggestive of a possible increase of the stellar ionizing emissivity over the declining quasar one for @xmath179 .",
    "* the analysis of the associated metal line systems suggests abundances generally below solar with typical values in the range @xmath180 [ c / h]@xmath181 .",
    "the derived values are lower than those estimated for associated systems found in lower @xmath10 quasars .",
