    "this partial order is the one defined by the restriction of partial maps .",
    "we also recall that inverse monoids , like groups , form a variety of algebras of type @xmath12 , and free inverse monoids exist on any set . the free inverse monoid on the set @xmath13 is , like the free group , obtained as a factor of the free monoid with the involution @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath15 ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "the notion of an @xmath0-inverse monoid is among the most important ones in the theory of inverse semigroups , for example , free inverse monoids are @xmath0-inverse @xcite .",
    "moreover , they play an important role in the theory of partial actions of groups , see kellendonk and lawson @xcite , and in this context they implicitly occur in dehornoy @xcite . in kaarli and mrki @xcite , they occur in the context of universal algebra . even in analysis",
    "they are useful : see nica @xcite , khoshkam and skandalis @xcite and steinberg @xcite for their role in the context of @xmath17-algebras .",

    "@xmath0-inverse cover _ of the inverse monoid @xmath1 if there exists an idempotent separating surjective homomorphism from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that every inverse monoid has an @xmath0-inverse cover .",
    "the proof is quite simple and constructive , the inverse cover it yields is an idempotent pure factor of a free inverse monoid , and therefore is always infinite .",
    "the question of whether finite inverse monoids admit a finite @xmath0-inverse cover was first proposed by henckell and rhodes @xcite , and has become one of the biggest open problems regarding finite inverse semigroups since .    in @xcite , auinger and szendrei",
    "have translated the @xmath0-inverse cover problem to the language of group varieties and graphs .",
    "they have proven that the question is equivalent to whether there is , for every finite graph , a locally finite group variety for which a certain condition is satisfied .",
    "these results are summarized in section 2 , and section 3 contains general observations regarding this condition , including the fact that the class of graphs for which a given group variety has the required property is closed downwards in the minor ordering , and can therefore be described by forbidden minors .",
    "section 4 contains our main result , which , using forbidden minors , describes the graphs for which there is a variety of abelian groups satisfying the required condition .",
    "not surprisingly , it turns out that these graphs consist of a quite narrow segment of all finite graphs .",
    "we define graphs in this paper to be finite and directed .",
    "the set of vertices of a graph @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath19 , the set of edges by @xmath20 , and the initial and terminal vertices of an edge @xmath21 are denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we also say that @xmath21 is a @xmath24-edge .",
    "we consider @xmath18 as the union of its vertices and edges , the union and intersection of subgraphs of @xmath18 are meant in this sense .",
    "connectedness of graphs will , however , be regarded in an undirected sense throughout the paper , that is , we call a digraph _ connected _ ( _ two - edge - connected _ ) if the underlying undirected graph is connected ( two - edge - connected ) . recall that an undirected graph is called _",
    "two - edge - connected _ if it is connected and remains connected whenever an edge is removed .",
    "a _ path _ in @xmath18 is a sequence @xmath25 of consecutive edges which , by definition , means that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or an empty path around an arbitrary vertex .",
    "there is an evident notion of inital and terminal vertices of paths , also denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively : if @xmath30 for some @xmath31 , then @xmath32 , and if @xmath33 is an empty path around @xmath34 , then @xmath35 . we do , however , also need to consider paths in a more general , undirected sense .",
    "we therefore introduce the graph @xmath36 , for which @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , and for an edge @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a @xmath42-edge .",
    "we will often consider paths in @xmath36 . in this context",
    ", we can also define the inverse of a path @xmath33 in @xmath36 , denoted by @xmath43 , to be the @xmath44-path traversing the edges of @xmath33 in the opposite direction .",
    "note that a path in @xmath36 can be regarded as a word in the free monoid @xmath45 with involution , where , of course , the empty paths correspond to the empty word , and the word corresponding to the path @xmath33 is of course the inverse of the words corresponding to @xmath46 for a path @xmath33 in @xmath36 , the _ graph spanned by @xmath33 _ , denoted by @xmath47 , is the subgraph of @xmath18 consisting of the vertices @xmath33 traverses and edges @xmath40 for which @xmath21 or @xmath41 occurs in @xmath33 .",
