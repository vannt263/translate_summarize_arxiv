    "_ singular links _ are oriented smooth links in 3-space but which can have a finite number of rigid ordinary double points .",

    "the homfly - pt and kauffman polynomials were extended to 3-variable polynomials for singular links by kauffman and vogel @xcite .",
    "recently , the extended homfly - pt polynomial was recovered by the construction of traces on singular hecke algebras @xcite ) .",
    "singular links became popular in connection with the construction of finite type knot invariants ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there is a new interest in singular links in connection with categorifications .",
    "the khovanov homology was extended to a homology for singular links in @xcite .",
    "the alexander polynomials of a cube of resolutions ( in vassiliev s sense ) of a singular knot were categorified in @xcite .",
    "moreover , a 1-variable extension of the alexander polynomial for singular links was categorified in @xcite .",
    "the generalized cube of resolutions ( containing vassilievs resolutions as well as those smoothings at double points which preserve the orientation ) was categorified in @xcite .    in this short note",
    "we make the simple observation that one can easily extend the state models of the jones and alexander polynomials to state models of their two - variable extensions , called respectively @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] , in the case of singular links .",
    "the extension of the alexander polynomial in @xcite coincides with @xmath2 .",
    "the categorification of @xmath3 ( as a 2-variable polynomial ) does not lead to anything new but just several copies of the usual khovanov homology @xcite .",
    "can @xmath4 be categorified with a triple graded homology ?    can the state sum from @xcite be extended for singular classical links in order to give a 3-variable extension of the polynomial @xmath5 ?",
    "we assume that the reader is familar with kauffman s state model for the jones polynomial @xcite and with his state model for the alexander polynomial @xcite .",
    "moreover , we assume that the link @xmath6 has a distinguished component , which we represent as a long knot .",
    "we can then choose the star - regions in a canonical way in the kauffman state model of the alexander polynomial ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "let a singular link be represented by a ( singular ) link diagram .",
    "two such link diagrams represent the same singular link if and only if they can be related by a finite sequence of ordinary reidemeister moves ( see e.g. @xcite ) together with the moves @xmath7 shown in fig . 1 and @xmath8 shown in fig .",

    "our state models for @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be generalized in the evident way to define invariants for singular links in handle bodies .",
    "we consider the handle body as a trivial line bundle over a planar surface . in order to define the generalization of @xmath4 we have just to choose two boundary components of the planar surface and we mark the adjacent regions of the complement of the link projection with the two stars ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider now long singular knots @xmath17 oriented from the left to the right ( for their definition see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the knot @xmath17 has exactly d double point singularities .",
    "going along the knot there is a well defined order of the double point singularities induced by the first passage through each double point .",
    "we make the following trivial observation : this order is preserved under all isotopies of the long singular knot .",
    "indeed , each of the elementary moves involves at most one double point and can not change this order .    let @xmath18 be the i - th double point .",

    "@xmath19 is a new independent variable .",

    "the polynomial @xmath22 is of degree 1 or -1 for each of the variables @xmath19 and @xmath23 is of degree 0 or 1 for each of the variables @xmath19 .",
    "one could consider each of them as an ordered set of @xmath24 laurent polynomials of the variable @xmath25 .",
    "the polynomials @xmath22 and @xmath23 are isotopy invariants for oriented singular long knots .",
    "if we consider knots instead of long knots then the variables @xmath26 are only well defined up to permutations .",
    "hence , we obtain in general only a partially ordered set of @xmath24 polynomials .",

    "one easily calculates    @xmath27    @xmath28 .",
    "the _ inverse long knot _",
    "@xmath29 is defined by reflecting the diagram of @xmath17 at a vertical line ( which interchanges the endpoints ) and then reversing the orientation on the knot .",
    "if we consider a long knot as a knot in the 3-sphere then the inverse long knot corresponds just to the usual inverse knot in the 3-sphere .",
    "a long singular knot @xmath17 is called _ invertible _ if @xmath17 is isotopic to @xmath29 as long singular knots .",
    "the calculation of the polynomial @xmath22 for @xmath30 is identical with that for @xmath15 besides the fact that the variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 have to be interchanged .",

    "this is not the case .",
    "one easily calculates that    @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , each of the two new polynomials shows that @xmath15 is not invertible .",
    "notice , that the previous polynomials @xmath3 and @xmath4 even applied to long knots fail to do this ( as well as the homfly - pt polynomial for singular links @xcite ) .",
    "we indicate only the changings with respect to the proofs of the invariance for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the proof that it is invariant under the moves @xmath8 is word for word identical with kauffman s original proof ( see @xcite ) that @xmath35 is invariant under reidemeister moves of type @xmath37 .",
    "we have just to replace the crossing which kauffman smoothes by the double point @xmath18 .      to prove invariance under the moves @xmath8 we have to consider all kauffman states @xmath15 near a triple point ( compare fig .",
    "15 in @xcite ) .",
    "we carry out just one example in fig . 10 and fig .",
    "the verification in all other cases is analogous and is left to the reader ."
