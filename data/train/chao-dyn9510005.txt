    "under the denomination of `` quantum chaos '' , a large body of theoretical and experimental work has been , and continues to be , devoted to the study of the specific features of a quantum system which can be traced back to the degree of chaoticity of the underlying classical dynamics @xcite . among them , questions concerning tunneling effects receive now an increasing degree of attention . indeed , although they are often considered as purely quantum , since they correspond to classically forbidden events , it appears amply clear now that tunneling processes are strongly affected by the nature of the underlying classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "this is made most explicit when considering time - dependent systems as well as systems in more than one dimension , for which , in contradistinction to the one-@xmath0 conservative problems usually considered in basic quantum mechanics textbooks , energy conservation does not constrain the motion to be integrable .",
    "a first consequence of having a richer dynamics is that quasi - degeneracies analogous to those found in the standard symmetric double well problem can be observed in systems possessing a discrete symmetry , independently of whether a potential barrier actually exists or not . indeed ,",
    "unless the dynamics is entirely ergodic , some classical trajectories are trapped in @xmath0-dimensional invariant manifolds ( the invariant tori ) inside the @xmath1-dimensional phase space .",
    "if there is a discrete symmetry , say parity or time reversal , in a given system , then any tori which are not themselves invariant under this symmetry operation will come in symmetrical pairs .",
    "semiclassical ebk quantization can be applied to these symmetrical tori , and , since they are entirely identical , this approximation yields degenerate energy levels . note that this effect is distinct from ordinary symmetry induced eigenvalue degeneracy .",
    "indeed , the effect is only semiclassically correct and tunneling effects lift this degeneracy .",
    "this kind of tunneling has been dubbed `` dynamical tunneling '' by davis and heller @xcite .",
    "rephrasing this in terms of wave functions dynamics makes it clearer why the term `` tunneling '' is proper in spite of the absence of a barrier .",
    "indeed , it is possible to construct what arnold has termed _ quasi - modes _",
    "@xcite whenever there exist invariant tori fulfilling the ebk quantization conditions @xcite .",
    "these are wave - functions semiclassically constructed on a single torus , and _ which fulfill the schrdinger equation up to any order in @xmath2_. here , similarly to what happens when a potential barrier actually exists ( e.g. a one-@xmath0 conservative system ) , the actual eigenstates are not approximated by a single quasi - mode , but rather by a linear combination of quasi - modes constructed on symmetry related tori .",
    "therefore , if one allows a quasi - mode constructed on one of the tori , to evolve for a very long time , it will eventually evolve into its symmetric partner , whereas classically trajectories remain indefinitely trapped on one torus .",
    "our interest in higher dimensional systems lies however mainly in the possibility of considering dynamics of a different nature . even for integrable systems ,",
    "no general theory of tunneling in multidimensional systems is presently available .",
    "however some theoretical and numerical studies @xcite clearly demonstrate that the tunneling mechanism in this case is rather similar to what is observed for one-@xmath0 systems .",
    "in particular the splitting between two quasidegenerate doublets has a smooth exponential dependence in @xmath2 .",
    "if on the contrary the dynamics is mixed , ( as will generically be the case for low dimensional hamiltonian systems ) , and one is interested in the tunneling between two symmetry related invariant tori separated by a significant chaotic region , new behavior has been observed , which is quite different from what one is used to in the integrable case . from a now growing body of numerical work , either on one - dimensional time dependent systems @xcite , or on two dimensional conservative systems @xcite , it has become clear that the presence of chaos is associated with certain qualitative features , namely : ( i ) great enhancement of the average splitting , ( ii ) extreme sensitivity to the variation of an external parameter , ( iii ) strong dependence of the tunneling properties on what is going on in the chaotic region separating the two tunneling tori . a particularly striking evidence of this last point is given in @xcite , where it is observed that reducing drastically the classical transport in the chaotic sea from the neighborhood of one torus to the one of its symmetric partners noticeably reduces the tunneling rates .    in @xcite",
    ", it has been demonstrated that a natural interpretation of this unusual tunneling behavior is obtained if one consider that instead of the `` direct '' tunneling mechanism characteristic of the integrable regime , a new tunneling mechanism takes over , in which the chaotic region plays a predominant role . in `` direct '' tunneling ,",
    "splittings are caused by the overlap of the semiclassical functions constructed on one torus of the symmetrical pair via the ebk scheme ( the `` quasi - modes '' ) .",
    "as discussed above , these quasi - modes are not eigenstates , but fulfill the schrdinger equation up to arbitrary order in @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , they can be connected to other states through `` tunneling '' matrix elements which are exponentially small in @xmath2 .",
    "( see section  ii.a of @xcite for an explicit example . ) in the `` chaos - assisted '' regime on the contrary , the picture is that the particle first tunnels from the integrable region to the chaotic sea and from there again to the symmetrical region .",
    "more precisely , this means that the tunneling is dominated by the matrix elements between the quasi - modes and states semiclassically localized in the chaotic region , rather than by the matrix element connecting directly the two quasi - modes .",
    "this process involves one ( or many ) intermediate state and two tunneling processes .",
    "the reason why it may nevertheless dominate is that , since the chaotic region is much closer in phase space than the symmetrical integrable region , the tunneling amplitudes are expected to be usually much larger .",
    "once in the chaotic region , there is nothing to stop the particle from reaching the symmetrical integrable region . in this process , not only",
    "do the two semiclassical states play a role , but the various delocalized chaotic eigenstates which might couple to them also become relevant . for this reason ,",
    "the tunneling amplitudes have a remarkable dependence on @xmath2 : first , they decay exponentially fast with @xmath2 , reflecting the smooth variation of the tunneling amplitude from the integrable region to the chaotic sea .",
    "second , however , and superposed upon this smooth variation , there is an extremely irregular fluctuation of the splittings , due to the violent variation in the strength of the coupling to the nearby - lying chaotic states .",
    "this depends very sensitively on the smallness of the energy denominator , i.e. on whether or not a chaotic level lies close to the tunneling doublet .",
    "in fact , these fluctuations can be so strong as to make any realistic assessment of the @xmath2 dependence of the tunneling amplitude impossible .",
    "note however that this picture may be oversimplified : it was observed on the kicked harper model by roncaglia et al .",
    "@xcite , that direct tunneling can be dominant even in the presence of a significant chaotic region .",
    "that the mechanism described above is actually the one taking place for tunneling in the presence of chaos can not , at the present time , be derived from the basic quantum mechanical law of evolution .",
    "the numerical evidence as well as a far more careful and detailed discussion of the process are given in @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that one of the most important implications of the chaos - assisted mechanism described above is that it allows for a modeling of the splitting distribution in terms of ensembles of random matrices , as discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "therefore not only a qualitative interpretation of the numerically observed tunneling behavior is obtained , but also _ quantitative _ theoretical predictions can be made , and compared to numerically obtained data with a surprisingly good accuracy .",
    "the purpose of this paper being the study of the resulting matrix ensembles , let us be more specific on what is understood by `` splitting distribution '' , and how the theoretical predictions have been obtained in @xcite . as mentioned above , a characteristic feature of tunneling in the presence of chaos is the extreme sensitivity of such quantities as splittings , to the variation of an external parameter . within the `` chaos - assisted '' interpretation of the tunneling mechanism ,",
    "this is quite natural since the splitting of a given doublet may vary by orders of magnitudes depending on whether a chaotic state is close to the tunneling doublet or not .",
    "therefore , very small changes of external parameters , which leave the classical dynamics almost unaltered , may drastically change the splitting by shifting chaotic levels a distance of a few mean spacings .",
    "therefore , in any experimental setting the statistical behavior of the splittings is likely to be of great relevance , even if one focuses on one single well - defined doublet . in this case , the physically relevant quantity will be the distribution of splittings for an ensemble obtained by varying an external parameter over a range which is neglible on the classical scale , but still large on the quantum scale ( i.e. the tunneling doublet crosses a lot of chaotic levels ) .",
    "by analogy with the random matrix ensembles describing the spectral fluctuations of classically chaotic systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or to their generalization introduced to describe partly chaotic systems ( see section  5 of @xcite ) , one can build random matrix ensembles modeling the tunneling distributions corresponding to a given phase space structure .",
    "we shall not repeat here in detail the prescription given in @xcite for constructing the random matrix ensemble relevant to a given classical configuration .",
    "( a few examples of such ensembles are given below . )",
    "the following points , however , should be stressed : first , we are not considering fully ergodic systems ( otherwise there would be no invariant tori ) ; hence the chaotic part of phase space can not a priori be considered as structureless .",
    "a whole set of partial barriers should quite generally be present , preventing the motion in the chaotic region from being completely random . in order to quantify the efficiency of these partial barriers ,",
    "additional time scales must be introduced apart from the mean lyapunov exponent . as a consequence , the random matrix ensembles associated to the chaotic part of the phase space",
    "can not be taken as structureless either , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "one has to introduce `` transition ensembles '' entirely specified by a set of `` transport parameters '' @xmath3 .",
    "these transport parameters are fixed by the classical dynamics , and are therefore not adjustable model parameters .",
    "therefore the parameters which determine the tunneling distribution are , in the chaos - assisted regime , of two kinds :    (i ) the variance @xmath4 of the tunneling matrix elements .",
    "it describes the classically forbidden part of the tunneling process .",
    "there exists , at the present time , no theoretical way to evaluate it .",
    "(ii ) the set of `` transport parameters '' @xmath3 , which are fixed by the classical dynamics inside the chaotic region .",
    "a second thing we would like to stress is that it is not necessary to solve analytically the thus constructed random matrix ensembles to obtain a `` theoretical prediction '' for the splitting distributions .",
    "indeed the latter are entirely specified by the random matrix ensemble , and can be obtained concretely by performing a rather straightforward monte carlo calculation : i.e.  taking at random a large number of matrices with the distribution specified by the ensemble , diagonalizing them numerically to obtain the splitting , and construct in this way a histogram of the splitting distribution .",
    "this was the procedure used in @xcite to compare splitting distributions of doublets of a system of coupled quartic oscillators with those predicted by the proper random matrix ensemble .",
    "the obvious drawback of using monte carlo simulations to produce the matrix ensembles prediction is that it sheds little light on the characteristic features of the distribution .",
    "this is made even more important here because , although all parameters but the tunneling amplitude @xmath5 can in principle be computed by studying the classical motion in the chaotic region , their practical calculation requires a great deal of effort in the simplest situations , and could turn out to be impossible for sufficiently complicated classical structures .",
    "moreover , in experimental realizations , the hamiltonian governing the dynamics may not be known in enough detail to allow fixing the parameters of the ensemble with sufficient confidence .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to gain some further understanding of the splitting distribution determined by the ensembles of random matrices constructed in @xcite , and to obtain explicit expressions for these distributions . as we shall see , they can in fact be expressed in rather simple form .",
    "moreover , the resulting distributions have some very specific general feature , which can be used as _ the fingerprint of chaos assisted tunneling _ even when the precise structure of the chaotic motion is unknown . because of the relative complexity of the derivation",
    ", we have chosen to organize this paper as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : result ] , we shall give the final result , without any justifications , and show how well our analytic findings compare with actual splitting distributions , obtained in @xcite for a system of coupled quartic oscillators .",
    "the remaining of the paper will be devoted to the derivation of this result .",
    "section  [ sec : without ] will deal with the simpler case where the chaotic phase space can be taken as structureless . in section  [ sec : with ] we shall derive the splitting distributions in the case where effective partial barriers are present , and discuss in more details the hypothesis and approximation used in the derivation . section  [ sec : conc ] will be devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "in the following we introduce some notation .",
    "we are interested in a system possessing a discrete symmetry @xmath6 , and for which tunneling takes place between two quasimodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 constructed on symmetrical invariant tori @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the eigenstates belong to a given symmetry class @xmath11 or @xmath12 depending on whether they are symmetric or antisymmetric under the action of @xmath6 .",
    "we note @xmath13 and @xmath14 the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the quasimodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if one neglects the direct coupling between the quasimodes , @xmath13 and @xmath14 have the same mean energy @xmath15 .",
    "the `` chaos - assisted '' mechanism proposed in @xcite assumes that the tunneling from @xmath9 to @xmath16 originates from the ( exponentially small ) coupling between @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) and chaotic states of same symmetry @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) semiclassically localized in the chaotic region surrounding the islands of stability containing @xmath9 and @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , in a basis where the chaotic part of the hamiltonian is diagonal , the + and - sectors appear respectively as @xmath20 after diagonalization of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the regular levels will be shifted respectively from an amount @xmath23 and @xmath24 , giving the splitting @xmath25 eq .  ( [ eq : hpm ] ) merely summarizes the semiclassical picture one has of the chaos assisted tunneling , but no random matrix modeling has been introduced yet .",
    "this latter is obtained by assuming that the statistical properties of the tunneling is correctly reproduced if one model @xmath21 and @xmath22 by some ensemble of matrices with a specified distribution .    as discussed in detail in @xcite , the natural choice for the tunneling matrix elements @xmath26 describing the classically forbidden process is to take them as independent gaussian variables with the same variance @xmath27 , and , in the absence of any partial barrier , to use for the chaotic levels @xmath28 the classical ensembles of wigner and dyson which are known to model properly the spectral statistics of completely chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "if time reversal invariance symmetry holds , as we shall asssume in the following , this means that one should take @xmath29 and @xmath30 as two independent sequences , with a distribution given by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "symbolically this ensemble is denoted by @xmath31 where the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 emphasize the independent nature of the distribution . in that case",
    ", we shall see in section  [ sec : without ] that the splitting distribution @xmath32 is merely a truncated cauchy law @xmath33    as demonstrated in @xcite , such a simple statistical modeling of the chaotic states does not apply any more when structures , such as partial barriers , prevent classical trajectories to flow freely from one part of the chaotic phase space to another . in such classical configurations ( which are presumably generic in systems where chaos and regularity coexist )",
    ", transition ensembles have to be introduced to obtain a correct statistical description of the chaotic states .",
    "compared to the case where no barriers are present , the distribution of chaotic states will be modified in two ways .",
    "first , each of the parity sequences , taken separately , will usually not be distributed as a goe anymore . however , as stressed in @xcite , and as will be made extremely clear in section  [ sec : without ] , this has a negligible influence on the splitting distribution .",
    "more important is that such barriers may induce strong correlations between the two parity sequences of chaotic states . to fix ideas ,",
    "let us consider a simple example for which a strong partial barrier separates the chaotic sea into two parts @xmath34 and @xmath35 which are symmetric images one of each other under @xmath6 . in that case",
    ", the relevant matrix ensemble can be symbolically written as @xcite @xmath36 where the variance of the matrix elements of @xmath37 is chosen such that it has ( in the neighborhood of @xmath15 ) the same mean spacing @xmath38 as the chaotic states , and the variance @xmath39 of the matrix elements of @xmath40 is fixed by the transport parameter @xmath41 through @xmath42 the transport parameter is in turn semiclassically related to the classical flux @xmath43 crossing the partial barriers by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the proportion of states in the corresponding symmetry class , @xmath46 the relative phase space volume of region 1 and 2 and @xmath0 the number of freedoms .    for very ineffective barriers , @xmath41 will be much larger than @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 will then be two essentially independent ensembles and one will recover in that case the truncated cauchy law eq .",
    "( [ eq : cauchy ] ) for the splitting distribution . at the opposite extreme",
    ", a perfect barrier would give @xmath50 ( except for classically forbidden processes ) , and the @xmath11 and @xmath12 spectra will be strictly identical .",
    "in particular so will be the displacements @xmath23 and @xmath24 , giving a null splitting . for small , but finite @xmath41 ,",
    "a typical level @xmath51 will be usually found close to its symmetric analog @xmath52 , though slightly shifted . in this case , although the displacements @xmath23 and @xmath24 are still distributed as cauchy , they are strongly correlated .",
    "this in turn noticeably affects the splitting @xmath53 .    here",
    "it may be usuful to give a qualitative description of the meaning of @xmath41 .",
    "it can be described as the ratio @xmath54 of two timescales , one of which is purely classical , whereas the other is essentially quantum mechanical : @xmath55 is the time necessary to cross the barrier , that is , the typical time that a classical trajectory needs in order to go from one part of the chaotic sea to the other .",
    "the second time scale @xmath56 is the heisenberg time @xmath57 , where @xmath38 is the average level spacing in the chaotic sea .",
    "eventually , of course , one expects @xmath41 to go to infinity , as the heisenberg time becomes classically infinite in the semiclassical limit .",
    "nevertheless there may well be a very large intermediate region , for which @xmath41 takes very small values .",
    "in such cases , there exists a classical time scale comparable or larger than the heisenberg time .",
    "this time scale is related to the time necessary to explore all of the available phase space . in this respect",
    "the situation is quite reminiscent of what happens in localization .",
    "the difference , of course , is that we only have a small number of weakly connected phase space regions and the long classical time has nothing to do with diffusion .",
    "usually , the ensemble describing the classical structure of a system will be more complicated that the simple one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is probable that transport from one regular island to its symmetric counterpart is affected through the joint effect of a whole set of moderately effective barriers rather than by the strong action of a single one .",
    "thus one will have to consider much more structured ensembles , with a transport parameter @xmath58 associated to each barrier . under these circumstances",
    ", there is a possibility that localization effects begin to play a non - negligible role .",
    "should localization become as effective in limiting the quantum transport as the classically forbidden processes , our treatment would become irrelevant . on the other hand we shall see in section  [ sec : with ] that when this is not the case a noticeable simplification of the problem occurs because all the information encoded in the transition ensemble ( that is , essentially , the @xmath59 s ) can be summarized in a single parameter @xmath60 , which is a weighted average of the variance of the @xmath61 .",
    "the splitting distribution @xmath32 therefore depends on three parameters : @xmath62 , the variance of the tunneling matrix elements , @xmath63 which measures the degree of correlation between the odd and even levels , and @xmath38 , the mean spacing of the chaotic levels to which the @xmath64 are connected .",
    "if one consider effective barriers , @xmath60 is smaller than @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 being related to classically forbidden processes is usually extremely small , and in particular much smaller than @xmath60",
    ". we shall therefore assume below @xmath65 .",
    "then , the main result of this paper is that , for this parameter range , the splitting distribution is given by :    * @xmath66 * @xmath67 * @xmath68    where the function @xmath69 is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath70 , namely @xmath71 @xmath72 as expected ( see section iv.b . of @xcite ) , only the smaller splittings are affected by the transport limitation , the distribution for larger splittings being unaffected .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 therefore , for small enough @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the distribution @xmath32 will , in a log - log plot , essentially consist of three straight lines : ( i ) a horizontal one ( at @xmath77 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0 ] ) ) , for @xmath78 .",
    "( ii ) a line of slope @xmath79 in the range @xmath80 . ( iii )",
    "a slope @xmath81 characteristic of the cauchy distribution for the range @xmath82 , after which the distribution brutally falls to zero .    here",
    "let us digress shortly to give an intuitive picture of what is happening .",
    "let us first assume that there are no barriers",
    ". then chaos - assisted tunneling is essentially a compound process involving the two symmetrical states and those chaotic states which lie nearby .",
    "fast tunneling ( large splittings ) occur only if at least one of these states actually lies very near to the quasi - degenerate tunneling state .",
    "this then yields a tunneling process mediated by one single delocalized chaotic state .",
    "this process has a characteristic @xmath83 distribution , as we shall show later .",
    "here it is essential to realize that the chaotic state involved , since it has a well - defined symmetry , will always directly couple from one torus to its symmetrical partner . on the other hand ,",
    "if we have an efficient barrier , the chaotic states also come in quasi degenerate doublets of opposite parity and of width @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , moderately fast processes will be mediated by such a doublet rather than by a single state .",
    "again , we shall show that this leads to a universal behavior of @xmath84 as long as the doublet is identifiable as such , that is , as long as the two energy denominators contribute roughly equally .",
    "however , for very fast processes , the tunneling will again be mediated by a single state , namely the one nearest to the tunneling doublet , and the @xmath83 behavior is again obtained .",
    "the details are given by the above formulae , which also show a considerable amount of information for intermediate cases which can not be derived in such a simple fashion .    before going to the calculation of the above distribution ,",
    "let us see how it compares to actual distributions of splittings obtained numerically for a system of two coupled quartic oscillators governed by an hamiltonian of the form @xmath85 except for their presentation ( we use here a log - log plot instead of a linear versus log binning ) , the data used in fig .",
    "[ fig : qo ] are exactly the same as those used in fig .",
    "13 of ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for more precise information on the system investigated . here",
    ", we shall only say that each set of data has been obtained by numerically calculating the splittings between regular states constructed on a given identified pair of symmetrical invariant tori , for various values of the coupling @xmath86 .",
    "the range of variation of @xmath86 is small on the classical scale ( the classical dynamics remains essentially the same ) , but sufficiently large on the quantum scale that a good statistical significance is reached .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : qo ] we display the comparison between the quartic oscillators data and the predicted form of the distribution eqs .",
    "( [ eq : distri : a])-([eq : distri : c ] ) for two splitting distributions associated to two different pairs of symmetric invariant tori .",
    "the agreement is extremely good , especially if one considers that the distribution extends over more than six decades . here",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath5 used for the analytical curves in fig .  [ fig : qo ] are actually tunable parameters .",
    "this was already the case for @xmath5 for the ensemble introduced in @xcite , since there is not yet any semiclassical theory allowing for the calculation of the matrix elements associated to such classically forbidden processes .",
    "here however , one has another tunable parameter @xmath60 . in principle , this parameter is fixed once the the random matrix ensemble describing the statistical properties of the chaotic level is known , which is the case for this particular system . in practice",
    "however , there is usually no way to relate @xmath60 analytically to , say , the set of transport parameters @xmath58 s",
    ". therefore @xmath60 eventually plays the role of a tunable parameter .",
    "it should be borne in mind however that @xmath60 and @xmath5 only fix the scale of the distribution , and in particular the place of the crossover from cauchy to the @xmath69-like behavior , but not its shape . therefore , despite the presence of two tunable parameters , the fact that the splitting distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : qo ] actually follows the prediction of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : distri : a])-([eq : distri : c ] ) is a very stringent test of the relevance of the whole `` chaos - assisted '' picture . after this attempt to put the results in perspective",
    ", we turn to their derivation .",
    "we now want to get down to computing the distribution of the splittings in the case in which no barriers are present . under these circumstances , it is sufficient to compute the distribution of @xmath87 , and hence @xmath88 , since these splittings are statistically independent .    to start with , one should note that , when considering the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hpm ] ) , the matrix elements @xmath89 are associated with classically forbiden processes , and are thus extremely small .",
    "therefore , one can compute the displacement @xmath90 using a first order perturbation result .",
    "one has however here to take special care with the rare , but important , case , where a chaotic level come extremely close to @xmath15 .",
    "this can be done using the exact two by two diagonalization result for each chaotic eigenstate , and adding up the contributions .",
    "this gives @xmath91 ( to be understood in the @xmath92 limit ) . in the absence of any values of @xmath93 too close to @xmath15 ,",
    "the above equation is equivalent to the usual perturbative result , @xmath94 but the full expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert1 ] ) has to be used to regularize it whenever any of the @xmath95 become of the order of @xmath5 .    although we shall give below a more detailed discussion of that point , the basic way we are going to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert1 ] ) is that the regularized form of @xmath96 prevents any splitting from being significantly larger than @xmath5 , and that for @xmath90 smaller than @xmath5 , eq .  ( [ eq : pert2 ] ) can be used safely . to clarify the discussion ,",
    "we shall for the moment replace the @xmath97 by their average value @xmath4 , and justify below why this does not change the result . without loss of generality we also set @xmath15 equal to zero ( @xmath15 is not correlated to the chaotic spectrum , so it can be used as the origin of the energies ) .",
    "we shall in addition consider the normalized regular level shift @xmath98 and energy level @xmath99 ( we drop the superscript @xmath100 or @xmath101 for the normalized quantities ) @xmath102    with these manipulations , @xmath103 is in principle obtained for @xmath104 ( i.e. @xmath105 ) as the integral @xmath106 where @xmath107 is is the joint probability of a goe spectra with mean density equal to one in the center of the semicircle .",
    "it appears however that , the correlations of the chaotic states have no influence on @xmath103 , because the physics here is determined by the singular nature of the energy denominator which is not expected to be very sensitive to many - particle correlations .    to demonstrate this point , let us consider for instance the integral eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral ] ) except that we take for the chaotic states a poisson distribution , i.e.  that we neglect any correlations between them . in that case , introducing @xmath108 , one can write @xmath109 that is the random variable @xmath98 is the average of the @xmath110 , where the @xmath111 s are independent variables with density of probability one at the origin . would the distribution of @xmath112 admit a second moment ( i.e.  @xmath113 ) , the usual central limit theorem would yield a gaussian distribution for @xmath103 . here , however , the situation is quite different since this variance actually diverges .",

    "if the chaotic states are distributed independently , eq .  ( [ eq : integral ] ) reads @xmath120 if we now take the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int2 ] ) , the result factorizes and one obtains @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the fourier transform of @xmath114",
    ". the large-@xmath123 behavior of the latter leads to a singularity of @xmath122 , which , by reason of the symmetry of @xmath114 , must be located at the origin .",
    "further , this singularity is of the type of a discontinuous derivative . for any symmetric function @xmath124 with the same large @xmath123 behavior as @xmath114 , @xmath125 decreases more rapidly that @xmath116 , which implies that @xmath126 has a continuous derivative .",
    "the jump in @xmath127 of the derivative of @xmath122 must therefore be the same as for @xmath128 , the fourier transform of which is @xmath129 .",
    "noting moreover that , because of the normalization , @xmath130 , one has @xmath131 and therefore @xmath132 from which the result follows immediately by inverse fourier transformation .    at the opposite extreme , one can consider the most rigid spectrum , and see what happens if the chaotic states are distributed as a picket fence . in that case",
    ", @xmath103 can be written as @xmath133 which , using the equality @xcite @xmath134 readily gives @xmath135 that is the very same cauchy distribution as for the poissonian case .",
    "there is no doubt that if the two extremes of totally uncorrelated and completely correlated spectra give the same result , the correlation between chaotic states play little or no role .",
    "therefore , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : without ] , the splittings are also cauchy - distributed when the chaotic states are goe distributed .",
    "indeed , this result can actually be shown using supersymmetric techniques @xcite and also turns out to follow from results on @xmath136-matrix ensembles for the one - channel case @xcite under quite general conditions for both the @xmath137 and the energies @xmath138 .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the sums involved in computing the @xmath139-matrix in a one channel system are exactly of the type we are interested in and their distribution can be found exactly under the assumption that the ensemble is ergodic and analytic in the energy .",
    "for details see @xcite and @xcite .    before turning to the more difficult case of problems where transport limitations play a role in the tunneling mechanism ,",
    "let us come back to a couple of points not treated in the above discussion . since we have seen that correlations between chaotic states are of little importance , we shall discuss these points under the assumption that there are no such correlations .",
    "the first concerns the fact that the tunneling matrix elements are randomly distributed following a gaussian law , instead of being constant as assumed in the above discussion .",
    "however , it can easily be checked that , in the poissonian case , this simply amounts to performing first the integral over the tunneling matrix elements distribution .",
    "the second point concerns the need to use the regularized form eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert1 ] ) instead of its nondegenerate approximation eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert2 ] ) .",
    "let us now see the effect of using this more correct formula which takes quasidegeneracies fully into account by treating the corresponding @xmath140 matrix exactly . in this case",
    "the relevant function of @xmath111 is equal to @xmath141 which is equal to @xmath110 for @xmath142 but saturates to a value of @xmath143 for smaller values of @xmath111 .",
    "this implies that @xmath122 has a singularity of the type described above only for @xmath144 less than @xmath145 .",
    "this in turn involves a departure of @xmath146 from pure exponential behavior when @xmath144 becomes of the order of @xmath76 , and hence for normalized splittings of the order of @xmath147 , which in unnormalized units correspond to splittings of order @xmath5 .",
    "we recover in this way the intuitive picture discussed above , namely that the basic role of the regularization is to prevent having splittings of size larger than the root mean square deviation of the @xmath137 , whereas the distribution for smaller values remains unaffected . for the distribution @xmath103 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : without ] , the effect of this regularization can not be observed because it only affects the range @xmath148 which is not covered in this linear scale .",
    "it is however clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qo ] , as well as in the figs .",
    "[ fig : mctoy ] and [ fig : mcqo ] of the following section .",
    "let us now consider the more complicated case of systems for which transport limitation induces strong correlation between the symmetry classes .",
    "as we have emphasised in the previous section , the correlation between chaotic states inside a symmetry class has little or no influence on the distribution of the shifts , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , of the regular level , due to their coupling with the chaotic states .",
    "therefore , even in the case where there exist efficient barriers to transport in the chaotic region , the shifts @xmath149 should be still distributed according to the cauchy distribution derived in the preceding section .",
    "in fact , the main effect of such barriers is to induce strong correlations between the @xmath150 and the @xmath151 , which only affect the distribution of the splittings themselves @xmath152 .",
    "another consequence of the presence of partial barriers which may also influence the distribution of splittings is that it may yield some inhomogeneity of the variance of the tunneling matrix elements , as well as of the correlation between chaotic states .",
    "we shall come back to this point at the end of the section when comparing our findings with exact results calculated numerically using monte - carlo techniques .      to lighten somewhat the notation we use in this subsection scaled energies @xmath153 ( for which the mean density of states around the regular level is therefore one ) , and note @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "we use the following modeling of our problem .",
    "first , we shall ignore any correlation between chaotic states inside each symmetry class and merely require that the mean density of chaotic states be equal to @xmath38 arround @xmath156 . to normalize the number of states to @xmath157",
    ", we choose the variables @xmath158 and @xmath159 both distributed according to a gaussian law , which we take to be @xmath160 . in this way , the density at zero is @xmath161 for each level ( and thus the total density is @xmath47 ) . since we shall consider the @xmath92 limit",
    ", this can be though of as a flat distribution on the scale of a mean level spacing , the gaussian form being just introduced to normalize in a proper way the distribution .",
    "again , we take the chaotic states to be identically distributed random variables , the @xmath158 are independent of each other for different values of @xmath162 .",
    "the correlations between the two parity sequences of chaotic states must , however , be implemented , which we shall do assuming that the @xmath163 have a gaussian distribution characterized by its width @xmath164 .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : result ] @xmath164 is related to a characteristic time necessary for a classical trajectory to travel from one regular island to its symmetric counterpart . to justify this construction ,",
    "let us consider for instance the ensemble of eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy ] ) introduced in section  [ sec : result ] . in this case",
    ", it was seen that the hamiltonians of the two symmetry sectors are related to one another by adding a goe matrix , the off - diagonal elements of which have variance @xmath165 , related through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ldef])-([eq : lflux ] ) to the classical flux @xmath43 crossing the partial barrier . as is well - known , the resulting spectrum is formally the same as the result of letting the levels moving according to an interacting brownian motion during a time @xmath166 , as described by dyson @xcite .",
    "however , for short times ( i.e.  small @xmath41 ) , it is generally accepted that an interacting diffusion process can be replaced by a free one @xcite , which here means that the @xmath167 follow a gaussian distribution , of width @xmath168 .",
    "this also follows more specifically from the results shown in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that a randomly distributed sequence diffusing over a short time @xmath41 only acquires correlations on a scale of @xmath169 .",
    "( note that for @xmath170 , this modeling becomes essentially meaningless .",
    "for instance it is not possible anymore to specify unambiguously what @xmath171 is to be associated with a given @xmath172 when considering the variance of their difference .",
    "this is not of great importance , though , since the final result shows that in this case the truncated cauchy behavior described in section  [ sec : without ] is recovered anyhow . )",
    "thus the joint probability distribution function of the @xmath158 and the @xmath159 is @xmath173 note the asymmetric treatment of @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "this simply means that , because of the very strong correlation between the two sets of eigenvalues , the large - scale distribution of one set entirely determines that of the other .    for more structured ensembles than the one of eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy ] ) , the actual diffusion process , while `` turning on '' the transport parameters @xmath58 s from zero to their actual value , may be noticeably more complicated . nevertheless , because the final splitting results from the average effect of the coupling with a large number of chaotic states , it is natural to assume that a kind of central limit theorem is involved and that the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : joint ] ) can also be used in practice ( we shall discuss this question in greater detail in the next subsection ) . as mentioned in section  [ sec : result ] however , there will not be anymore a simple relationship between @xmath60 and the transport parameters of these ensembles .    now the problem is to compute the splitting distribution .",
    "we shall disregard in the following the complications created by the inclusion of the complete expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert1 ] ) for the shifts , since this only causes a cutoff at values of @xmath53 equal to @xmath5 , as was already discussed in the previous section . as a further simplification we shall take for a moment the tunneling matrix elements as being constant ( equal to @xmath5 ) and shall come back later to the ( slight ) modifications to the result due to averaging over their gaussian distribution . introducing the scaled variable @xmath174 , ( @xmath175 ) the distribution of @xmath176",
    "is obtained as @xmath177 again , this integration can be factorized by introducing the fourier transform @xmath178 of @xmath179 , and everything can be reduced to quadratures .",
    "the details are a trifle tedious and are therefore relegated to appendix a. the final result is @xmath180 here @xmath181 is given by the expression @xmath182 for ease of reference we give the following integrals , which are derived for completeness in appendix b : @xmath183 an asymptotic study of the function @xmath184 for @xmath185 and @xmath186 yields @xmath187 ( the prefactors given here are actually correct , but we shall not need them , and the order of magnitude is easy to obtain ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath181 basically gives a measure of the domain of @xmath123 such that @xmath188 is larger than one .",
    "for @xmath189 , this is obviously of order @xmath190 .",
    "it can moreover be evaluated more precisely by noting that in this range of @xmath191 , @xmath192 .",
    "this is the case , because in the range of @xmath123 where @xmath193 , i.e. for @xmath123 not large , both @xmath194 and @xmath195 are much larger than one if @xmath191 is , and therefore @xmath43 saturates to its asymptotic value @xmath47 anyhow .",
    "one therefore finds for @xmath189 @xmath196 and therefore @xmath197 for @xmath198 on the other hand , @xmath199 is large only in the neigborhood of @xmath200 . from this",
    "follows that one can restrict oneself to the range of integration @xmath201 .",
    "one obtains @xmath202 and therefore @xmath203 it remains to perform the inverse fourier transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : from_app ] ) , and to deduce the asymptotic behavior of @xmath179 from the one of @xmath204 . for large @xmath176 , @xmath179 is dominated by the singularities of its fourier transform , which here means the derivative discontinuity at the origin . therefore for @xmath205 one can use in eq .",

    "@xmath208 the above result amounts to adding independently the variable @xmath23 and @xmath24 , distributed as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cauchy1 ] ) , and to neglect the correlations between the two symmetry classes . as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "this is indeed quite natural since splittings larger than @xmath209 are due to chaotic levels coming closer than a distance @xmath210 of the regular level .",
    "since @xmath210 can be viewed as the scale on which chaotic levels are correlated , chaotic states contributing to @xmath179 for @xmath211 can therefore be considered as essentially decorrelated from their symmetric counterparts . in the language of section 2 , the splittings we are looking at here are so large that the tunneling is always mediated by a single state .",
    "let consider now the range @xmath212 , for which the splitting distribution is affected by correlation between symmetry classes . in that case , the term @xmath213 in the inverse fourier transformation eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdef ] ) is essentially constant in all the range @xmath214 where @xmath178 differs from its asymptotic behavior @xmath215 .",

    "therefore it can usually be neglected , although in some special circumstances it shows up as a small plateau between these two regimes ; we shall disregard it from now on .",
    "then , the large-@xmath176 behavior of @xmath222 is dominated by the @xmath226 singularity at the origin of @xmath215 , so that it goes as @xmath227 as @xmath228 .",
    "this is in fact the hallmark of the @xmath229 regime we are discussing .    finally , one has to take into account the fact that the tunneling matrix elements are not constant , but randomly distributed . as can be seen in the derivation of eq .",

    "more structured ensembles deserve however some further discussion .",

    "this , for instance , allows to compute @xmath5 from the variance of the tunneling matrix elements _ before _ diagonalization of the chaotic part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 and @xmath5 have moreover a certain number of intuitively clear properties : if all @xmath259 are multiplied by a constant factor , the effective tunneling element @xmath5 is multiplied by the same factor , whereas @xmath60 is unaffected .",
    "further , if all @xmath259 are identical , then the effective tunneling element is the same . on the other hand ,",
    "the same is not true of @xmath60 : if all @xmath260 and all @xmath259 are taken to be equal , the effective efficiency of the classical barrier now depends on the number of different components of phase space through which tunneling can take place .",
    "further , we see that any components with negligible values of @xmath259 will contribute negligibly both to @xmath5 and @xmath60 .",
    "thus we can identify a given part of phase space through which tunneling actually occurs and limit ourselves to it .    with the definitions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : equi_v ] ) and ( [ eq : equi_a ] ) of @xmath5 and @xmath60 , structured ensemble are therefore seen to behave in essentially the same way as the simple ensemble eq .",

    "( [ eq : f : qgg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : f : qll1 ] ) , that is respectively @xmath270 must now be fulfilled for all @xmath271 s .",
    "the transition between the different regimes of the distributions may therefore be less sharp than for the ensemble eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy ] ) .",
    "if the partial barriers structures were to become highly developed , say to the point that the ensemble could meaningfully be described in terms of band matrices , then obviously the issue of localization should have to be considered . in this case",
    ", the orders of magnitude of the @xmath260 might become comparable to those of the @xmath259 , and most of the splitting distribution might be actually in a transition - like regime .",
    "this is exactly the sort of problems we pointed out in our earlier discussion of the physical situation .",
    "however , as long as the @xmath260 s are clearly larger than the @xmath259 s , the transition from one regime to another should still take place on a short scale as compared to the range spanned by the distribution . physically speaking",
    ", this condition amounts to saying that classically forbidden processes are always much slower than classically allowed ones . in that case",
    ", the form of the result should not be noticeably affected .",
    "for example , as seen is fig  [ fig : mcqo ] , the distribution resulting from the ensemble described in eq .",
    "( 4.18 ) still perfectly follows the predicted form eqs .",
    "( [ eq : distri : a])-([eq : distri : c ] ) ( note however that @xmath60 is now a tunable parameter ) .",
    "as a conclusion , we have provided in this paper an analytical study of the splitting distributions generated by ensembles of random matrices constructed in @xcite to model a tunneling process in the chaos assisted regime .",
    "the original ensembles may contain such a complicated structure that a general answer to this problem may seem a priori out of reach .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that only the average size of the tunneling matrix elements and the degree of correlation between the chaotic spectra in the different symmetry class affect the distribution , and that therefore the problem can be reduced to a simpler formulation which is tractable .",
    "the basic reason for the considerable simplifications encountered was in essence already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is due to the fact that for large splittings only the situation of near - resonance to a given state of the chaotic sea is of relevance . to this obvious remark ,",
    "we only need add that for the case in which efficient barriers are at work , the tunneling operates not through single states , but through quasi - degenerate doublets of states of opposite parity . these are of course less efficient in promoting tunneling , since the particle requires a time of the order of the width of the doublet to reach the symmetrical torus . in either case , the behavior is determined by rather natural probabilistic considerations .",
    "it turns out to be sufficient to consider only the probability of one single eigenvalue being near the tunneling state , so that correlations between eigenvalues and the like could be safely ignored .",
    "further , the very simplicity of the physical picture given here results in it being fairly robust to changes in minor details of the model .",
    "thus it does not appear necessary that all states in the chaotic sea should participate equally in the tunneling process , nor that the couplings should be uniform .",
    "in fact , the main limitations of our result seem to be the ones related to localization phenomena .",
    "if the structure of the barriers in phase space is sufficiently complicated , it is possible that localization effects , associated to the presence of a large number of partial barriers , become as effective in limiting tunneling from one quasimode to its symmetric partner as the initial classically forbidden process . in that case",
    ", the splitting distributions we have obtained would not be relevant anymore .",
    "however , this should not be a too severe limitation , and it should generally be possible to determine for any given system whether this takes place or not . when it does not , the picture of tunneling in the presence as well as in the absence of barriers to transport is indeed the one we gave .",
    "this is substantiated by the numerical work done : in particular , we showed that not only the simplest model of a barrier gives results in good agreement with theoretical predictions , but also a highly specific random matrix ensemble constructed explicitly in order to model chaos - assited tunneling in a system of coupled quartic oscillators was well fitted by the theoretical predictions , as were also the actual splitting distribution for this system .",
    "this might possibly open up a way to identify chaos - assisted tunneling in experimental systems . in such systems ,",
    "the exhaustive study of the classical mechanics necessary to produce a satisfactory random matrix ensemble would probably not be feasible .",
    "nevertheless the above remarks strongly suggest that if chaos - assisted tunneling is present , the splitting distribution will reflect the fact by showing a highly specific and well - characterized behavior .",
    "indeed , as discussed throughout this paper , only the scale of the distribution and the position of the transitions between the different regimes are system dependent , but the shape of the distribution is essentially universal . in particular the experimental detection of a transition from a @xmath84 behavior , characteristic of the @xmath69-like regime , to a @xmath83 behavior characteristic of the cauchy - like regime , would be a powerful argument in favor of the presence of chaos - assisted tunneling .",

    "<S> a compound tunneling mechanism from one integrable region to another mediated by a delocalized state in an intermediate chaotic region of phase space was recently introduced to explain peculiar features of tunneling in certain two - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is known as chaos - assisted tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> we study its consequences for the distribution of the level splittings and obtain a general analytical form for this distribution under the assumption that chaos assisted tunneling is the only operative mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the analytical form we obtain agrees with splitting distributions calculated numerically for a model system in which chaos - assisted tunneling is known to be the dominant mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution depends on two parameters : the first gives the scale of the splittings and is related to the magnitude of the classically forbidden processes , the second gives a measure of the efficiency of possible barriers to classical transport which may exist in the chaotic region . </S>",
    "<S> if these are weak , this latter parameter is irrelevant ; otherwise it sets an energy scale at which the splitting distribution crosses over from one type of behavior to another . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed form of the crossover is also obtained and found to be in good agreement with numerical results for models for chaos - assisted tunneling . </S>"
