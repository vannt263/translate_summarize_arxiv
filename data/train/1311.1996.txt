    "<S> [ fig : fig4](a ) . at large @xmath41 , @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , a direct consequence of the @xmath43 scaling discussed in reference to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , the relaxation time tends to decrease with increasing @xmath17 , a trend better seen when inspecting the characteristic gb velocity extracted from the corresponding velocity distributions ( table sm4 in  @xcite ) . at low @xmath41 , the same departure from the @xmath81 scaling observed for @xmath46 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] is also seen for all the other applied strains . </S>",
    "<S> although the data are somehow scattered , they suggest that the characteristic relaxation time at low @xmath41 tends to increase as @xmath17 decreases , while the crossover scattering vector appears to be rather @xmath17-independent , with @xmath82 on the order of the grain size ( @xmath23 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the second scaling parameter , @xmath70 , corresponds to the number of cycles needed to reach the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , @xmath70 is found to steadily increase with @xmath41 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](b ) ) , indicating that the time required to reach a steady state depends on the probed length scale , with stationary dynamics first attained on large length scales , a somehow counterintuitive result . to rationalize these findings </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the applied shear allows the polycrystal to explore regions in configuration space that were unaccessible to the spontaneous dynamics . since the energy injected in the system by shearing is finite , these new configurations can not be arbitrarily different from the initial ones ; in particular , they must be closer to the initial ones at larger length scales , because the energetic cost of reconfiguring the sample over a length scale @xmath83 increases with @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , stationary dynamics would be reached earlier at small @xmath41 , because at large length scale the set of configurations explored in the stationary regime would be closer to the initial one . </S>",
    "<S> one can then define a critical length scale , @xmath84 , such that above it stationary dynamics are observed from the very beginning of the experiment ( _ i.e. _ from the first shear cycle ) . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the wave vector for which @xmath87 . the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](b ) shows that @xmath84 grows with the strain amplitude , consistent with the above picture , and is of the order of the grain size .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated plasticity in a cyclically sheared colloidal polycrystal . </S>",
    "<S> our main finding is that shear - induced rearrangements are ballistic , a behavior at odd with previous simulations and with experiments on granular media and glassy colloids , for which diffusive dynamics under shear were reported . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , both the ballistic dynamics and the compressed exponential relaxations found here are strongly reminiscent of the spontaneous dynamics of many out - of - equilibrium materials  @xcite , in agreement with mesoscopic models  @xcite and ongoing simulations  @xcite where the dynamics results from the dipolar strain field set by localized plastic events . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the transition between the aging and the stationary regime exhibits an intriguing length scale dependence that , to our knowledge , has not been reported previously . </S>",
    "<S> more theoretical and experimental work will be needed to fully elucidate these surprising features .    </S>",
