    "<S> the reheat temperature obtains a lower bound @xmath145  gev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the temperature scale of reheating should always be lower than the mass of the inflaton , @xmath146 .    besides the upper bound placed on @xmath137 by thermal production , </S>",
    "<S> there are also constraints arising from non - thermal gravitino production via the direct decay of the inflaton . </S>",
    "<S> while these constraints can be rather severe for susy hybrid inflation @xcite , gravitino production depends on the susy breaking sector and these models are still viable . as displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ trk ] , significantly lower values of @xmath146 can be obtained with @xmath147 . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the allowed range of parameters where the gravitino constraint can be evaded . with minimal khler potential </S>",
    "<S> , it can be shown that even the most stringent constraint can be satisfied if @xmath106 is sufficiently small .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the important role played during hybrid inflation by one of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms generated in minimal supergravity . in the simplest example a scalar spectral index value of @xmath148 , preferred by wmap5 , </S>",
    "<S> is realized if the overall sign of this term is negative . </S>",
    "<S> this case also permits one to estimate the inflaton mass to be of order @xmath149  gev . </S>",
    "<S> it is amusing that this same soft term , linear in the inflaton field , also allows one to resolve the mssm @xmath2 problem . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that supersymmetric hybrid inflation models with minimal khler potential are both realistic and in good agreement with the current observations . </S>",
    "<S> an important prediction of these models has to do with the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath3 . </S>",
