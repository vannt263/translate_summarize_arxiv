    "the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak interactions has been so far successfully tested at several machines , such the lep and tevatron accelerators and has been lately confirmed by the data collected by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "new physics models have nonetheless been proposed to solve the drawbacks of the sm , namely the hierarchy problem , the dark matter observation or the still undetected higgs boson , responsible for the mass generation .",
    "the large amount of data collected at the centre - of - mass energy of 7 tev at the lhc opens a window to extensively search for new physics .",
    "the further increase to 8 and ultimately 14 tev , as well as higher integrated luminosities , will extend this investigation in the near future .    the simplest possible extension of the sm consists in a gauge group of larger rank involving the introduction of one extra   factor , inspired by grand unification theories ( guts ) , which leads to the prediction of a new neutral gauge boson @xmath0 .",
    "the phenomenology of the @xmath0 has been studied from a theoretical viewpoint ( see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite or the more recent work in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas searches for new heavy gauge bosons have been carried out at the tevatron by the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations and at the lhc by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "besides the @xmath0 bosons yielded by the extra   group , the analyses have also investigated the so - called sequential standard model ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. a @xmath0 with the same couplings to fermions and gauge bosons as the @xmath4 of the sm .",
    "the sequential standard model does not have theoretical bases like the  models , but it is used as a benchmark , since , as will be seen later on , the production cross section is just function of the @xmath0 mass and there is no dependence on other parameters .",
    "the tevatron analyses searched for high - mass dielectron resonances in @xmath5 collisions at 1.96 tev and set a lower @xmath0 mass limit of about 1023 ( d0 ) and 963 ( cdf ) gev for the @xmath3 .",
    "the lhc experiments investigated the production of both dielectrons and dimuons at large invariant masses and several models of @xmath0 production , i.e. different   gauge groups .",
    "the cms collaboration , by using event samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath6  fb@xmath7 , excluded a @xmath0 with sm - like couplings and mass below 2.32 tev , a gut - inspired @xmath0 below 1.49 - 1.69 tev and a kaluza ",
    "klein graviton in extra - dimension models @xcite below 0.71 - 1.63 tev .",
    "the atlas collaboration analyzed 5  fb@xmath7 of data and obtained a bound of 2.21 tev for the sm - like case , in the range 1.76 - 1.96 tev for the  scenarios and about 0.91 - 2.16 tev for the randall  sundrum gravitons .",
    "all such analyses , and therefore the obtained exclusion limits , crucially rely on the assumption that the @xmath0 decays into standard model particles , with branching ratios depending on its mass and , in the gut - driven case , on the parameters characterizing the specific   model : such a choice is dictated by the sake of minimizing the parameters ruling the @xmath0 phenomenology . as a matter of fact , in the perspective of searching for new physics at the lhc , there is no actual reason to exclude @xmath0 decays into channels beyond the sm , such as its supersymmetry . in fact , new physics contributions to the @xmath0 width will significantly decrease the branching ratios into sm particles , and therefore the mass limits quoted by the experiments may have to be revisited .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 decays into supersymmetric particles , if existing , represent an excellent tool to investigate the electroweak interactions at the lhc in a phase - space corner that can not be explored by employing the usual techniques .",
    "therefore , the possible discovery of supersymmetry in @xmath0 processes would open the road to additional investigations , since one would need to formulate a scenario accommodating both sparticles and heavy gauge bosons .",
    "the scope of this paper is indeed the investigation of the phenomenology of @xmath0 bosons at the lhc , assuming that they can decay into both sm and supersymmetric particles . as for supersymmetry",
    ", we shall refer to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite and study the dependence on the mssm parameters .",
    "a pioneering study of supersymmetric contributions to @xmath0 decays was carried out in @xcite , wherein the partial widths in all sm and mssm channels were derived analytically , and the branching ratios computed for a few   scenarios .",
    "however , the numerical analysis was performed for a mass = 700  gev , presently ruled out by the late experimental measurements , and only for one point of the supersymmetric phase space .",
    "therefore , no firm conclusion could be drawn about the feasibility to search for the @xmath0 within supersymmetry at the lhc .",
    "this issue was tackled again more recently . ref .",
    "@xcite studied how the @xmath0 mass exclusion limits change once sparticle and exotic decay modes are included , for many  models and varying the supersymmetric particle masses from 0 to 2.5 tev .",
    "the higgs and neutralino sectors in extensions of the mssm , including gut - inspired  models , were thoroughly debated in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . ref .",
    "@xcite considered the @xmath8 gauge group , b and l being the baryon and lepton numbers , and focused on the decay of the @xmath0 into charged - slepton pairs for a few points in the mssm phase space and various values of @xmath0 and slepton masses .",
    "@xcite investigated all possible decays of the @xmath0 in the sm and mssm , and several  models , for two sets of supersymmetric parameters and a @xmath0 mass in the 1 - 2 tev range .    in the following ,",
    "we shall extend the above work in several aspects .",
    "special attention will be paid to the mssm spectrum after the addition of the  gauge symmetry .",
    "squark and slepton masses will be parametrized as the sum of a soft mass and the so - called d- and f - terms @xcite .",
    "in particular , accounting for the d - term has an impact on the sfermion masses , which get an extra contribution driven by the   group .",
    "higgs , chargino and neutralino masses will be determined by diagonalizing the corresponding mass matrices .",
    "a detailed study will be thereafter undertaken by allowing the   and mssm parameters to run within suitable ranges , taking into account the recent experimental limits . throughout this work",
    ", particular care will be taken about the decay of the @xmath0 into slepton pairs , i.e. charged sleptons or sneutrinos , eventually leading to final states with four charged leptons or two charged leptons and missing energy , due to neutralinos . in fact , in the complex hadronic environment of the lhc , leptonic final states are the best channels to perform precise measurements and searches .",
    "slepton production in @xmath0 decays has the advantage that the @xmath0 mass is a further kinematical constrain on the invariant mass of the slepton pair .",
    "moreover , the extension of the mssm by means of the  gauge group provides also an interesting scenario to study dark matter candidates , such as neutralinos @xcite or right - handed sneutrinos @xcite , whose annihilation or scattering processes may proceed through the coupling with a @xmath0 boson .",
    "we shall present results for the @xmath0 production cross sections and the branching ratios into both standard model and supersymmetric final states , thoroughly scanning the u(1)@xmath9 and mssm parameter spaces , which will enable one to estimate the lhc event rates with sparticle production in @xmath0 decays .",
    "we point out that , in order to draw a statement on the feasibility of the lhc to search for supersymmetry in @xmath0 decays , one should also account for the standard model backgrounds .",
    "however , in assessing whether the signal can be separated from the background , one would need to consider exclusive final states , wherein acceptance cuts on final - state jets , leptons and possible missing energy , as well as detector effects , are expected to play a role .",
    "the framework of a monte carlo generator @xcite , wherein both signal and background events are provided with parton showers , hadronization , underlying event and detector simulations , is therefore the ideal one to carry out such a comparison .",
    "we shall thus defer a detailed investigation of the backgrounds to a future study , after the implementation of our modelling for @xmath0 production and decay in a monte carlo code .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall briefly discuss the  gauge group yielding the @xmath0 boson and the particle content of the mssm .",
    "section 3 will be devoted to summarize the new features of the mssm , once it is used in conjunction with the   group . in section 4 , as a case study , we will choose a specific point of the mssm/   parameter space , named ` representative point ' , and discuss the mssm spectrum in this scenario .",
    "in section 5 , we shall present the @xmath0 branching ratios into sm and bsm particles for several   models and in the sequential standard model .",
    "we will first investigate the decay rates in a particular ` reference point ' of the parameter space and then vary the   mixing angle and the mssm parameters .",
    "particular attention will be devoted to the decays into sleptons and to the dependence of the branching fractions on the slepton mass . in section 6 the leading - order cross section for @xmath0 production in the  scenarios and in the sequential standard model will be calculated .",
    "besides , the number of events with sparticle production in @xmath0 decays will be computed for a few energy and luminosity phases of the lhc . in section 7",
    "we shall summarize the main results of our study and make some final remarks on the future developments of the analysis here presented .",
    "in appendix a the main formulas used to calculate the @xmath0 branching ratios will be presented .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we shall consider extensions of the standard model leading to   bosons , which will be allowed to decay into both sm and supersymmetric particles .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and minimizing the dependence of our analysis on unknown parameters , we shall refer to the mssm . in this section",
    "we wish to briefly review the main aspects of the models used for   production and decay .",
    "there are several possible extensions of the sm that can be achieved by adding an extra  gauge group , typical of string - inspired guts ( see , e.g. , refs .",
