    "precise radial velocity surveys have detected over 100 planetary companions to fgkm dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood ( see http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/planets/catalog for a list of planets and discovery references ) . among the interesting trends that have been uncovered in this sample of planets",
    "are a positive correlation between the frequency of planets and metallicity of the host stars @xcite , a paucity of massive , close - in planets @xcite , and a ` piling - up ' of less - massive , close - in planets near periods of @xmath8 .",
    "this latter trend is important because the number of planets which transit their parent stars is roughly proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the semi - major axis .",
    "the discovery and interpretations of these global trends provide clues to the physical mechanisms that affect planetary formation , migration , and survival .",
    "a somewhat different way of obtaining clues about the physical processes at work in planetary systems is to acquire detailed information about individual planets . with radial velocity measurements alone ,",
    "such information is limited only to the minimum mass @xmath11 of the planet , and the semi - major axis @xmath10 and eccentricity of its orbit . however , if the planet also transits its parent star , then it is possible to infer considerably more information .",
    "a basic transit measurement allows one to infer the radius , mass , and density of the planet , as has been done with the only known transiting extrasolar planet , hd209458b @xcite .",
    "this in turn allows one to place constraints on the planet s orbital migration history @xcite .",
    "more detailed photometric and spectroscopic data during ( and outside of ) the transit can be used to study the composition of , and physical processes in , the planetary atmosphere @xcite , measure the oblateness , and thus constrain the rotation rate , of the planet @xcite , and to search for rings and satellites associated with the planet @xcite .",
    "the ` classical ' method of searching for planets via microlensing was first proposed by @xcite , and subsequently further developed by @xcite . in this method , a planetary companion to the primary lens star produces a small perturbation atop the smooth , symmetric lensing light curve created by the primary .",
    "the microlensing method has several important advantages over other methods , as well as several disadvantages ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the most important advantage is that the strength of the planet s signal depends weakly on the planet / primary mass ratio and thus it is the only currently feasible method to detect earth - mass planets @xcite .",
    "the other advantage is that it enables one to detect planets located at large distances of up to several tens of kiloparsecs .",
    "however , it also has disadvantages , the most important of which is that the only useful information one can obtain is the mass ratio between the planet and the primary .",
    "thus classical microlensing searches only allow one to identify the existence of the planet , and build statistics about the types of planetary systems , but can not be used to obtain detailed information about the discovered planets .",
    "this is especially problematic in light of the fact that follow - up of the discovered systems will generally be difficult or impossible .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite proposed a novel method of detecting planets via microlensing .",
    "they suggested that one could detect close - in giant planets orbiting the _ source _ stars of caustic - crossing binary - lens events via accurate and detailed photometry of the binary - lens light curve . in this method",
    ", the planet can be detected because the light from the planet is sufficiently magnified during the caustic crossing to produce a noticeable deviation to the lensing light curve of the primary .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ratio of the ( unlensed ) flux from the planet to the ( unlensed ) flux from the star , and @xmath2 is the angular radius of the planet in units of the angular einstein ring radius @xmath12 of the lens system .",
    "the einstein ring radius is related to the physical parameters of the lens system by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the schwarzschild radius of the lens , @xmath15 is the total mass of the lens , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the distances between the observer - source , observer - lens , and lens - source , respectively . for searches in the optical ,",
    "the light from the planet will be dominated by the reflected light from the star , and @xmath20 for close - in planets .",
    ", optical searches will generally only be sensitive to close - in planets .",
    "however , planets may have significant intrinsic flux in the infrared , enabling the detection of more distant companions at longer wavelengths . ] adopting typical parameters , @xmath21 , and thus @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this level of photometric precision is currently within reach of the largest aperture telescopes .",
    "the exquisite resolution afforded by caustics may allow one to study features on and around the source in detail , and with larger aperture telescopes , one may able to study spots and bands on the surfaces of detected planets by looking for small deviations to the nominal light curve @xcite . here",
    "we study the signatures of these and other structures on lensing light curves , quantify the magnitude of the deviations , and assess their detectability using current and future instrumentation .",
    "specifically , we consider the signatures of rings and satellites , as well as atmospheric features such as spots , zonal bands , and scattering . @xcite",
    "considered using variations in the polarization during the planetary caustic crossing to probe the composition of the planetary atmosphere .",
    "the effects of the phase of the planet on the light curve were considered previously by @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : binlens ] , we discuss binary lenses and their associated caustic structures , and describe the magnification patterns near caustics .",
    "we discuss expectations for the existence , stability , and properties of rings , satellites , and atmospheric features of close - in extrasolar planets in ",
    "[ sec : gen ] . in ",
    "[ sec : quantitative ] , we layout the formalism for calculating microlensing light curves , and apply this formalism to make a quantitative predictions for the deviations caused by planets (  [ sec : planet ] ) , satellites (  [ sec : satellites ] ) , rings (  [ sec : rings ] ) , and atmospheric features (  [ sec : atmosphere ] ) .",
    "we address the detectability of these deviations in  [ sec : detect ] , and summarize and conclude in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "if a microlensing event is caused by a lens system composed of two masses , the resulting light curve can differ dramatically from the symmetric curve due to a single lens event .",
    "the main new feature of binary lens systems is the formation of caustics .",
    "caustics are the set of positions in the source plane @xmath23 on which the magnification of a point source is formally infinite .",
    "the set of caustics form closed curves , which are composed of multiple concave line segments that meet at points .",
    "the concave segments are referred to as fold caustics , whereas the points are cusps .",
    "the number and shape of caustic curves varies depending on the separation and the mass ratio between the two lens components .",
    "figure [ fig : caustic ] shows an example caustic structure of a binary lens system with equal mass components separated by @xmath12 . for more details on the caustic structure of binary lenses , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the caustic cross section generally decreases with decreasing mass ratio , and decreases for widely and closely separated components .",
    "therefore , the majority of caustic - crossing binary - lens events will have caustic structures similar to that shown in figure [ fig : caustic ] .",
    "most source trajectories ( straight lines through the source plane ) will not intersect the caustic near cusps , therefore the majority of caustic crossings will be simple fold caustic crossings . near a fold caustic ,",
    "the total magnification @xmath24 of a point source is generically given by @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angular normal distance of the source from the fold in units of @xmath12 , @xmath27 is related to the local derivatives of the lens potential , and describes the effective ` strength ' of the caustic ( also in units of @xmath12 ) , and @xmath28 is the magnification of all the images unrelated to the caustic .",
    "the divergent nature of the magnification ( as @xmath29 ) translates into high angular resolution in the source plane .    due to the divergent magnification near a caustic ,",
    "the light curve of an caustic - crossing binary lens event is characterized by sharp spikes which are generally easily detectable .",
    "@xcite predicted that @xmath30% of all events seen toward the galactic bulge should be caustic - crossing events",
    ". analyses of the databases of the macho @xcite and ogle @xcite lensing surveys have demonstrated that binary microlensing events are being detected at a rate roughly consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "therefore a significant sample of caustic - crossing binary - lens events should be available each year for planet searches .",
    "the planetary caustic crossing is expected to occur within @xmath31 of the stellar caustic crossing .",
    "therefore , in order to detect close - in planets and their associated structures , extremely dense sampling for a period of @xmath32 days centered around one of the stellar caustic crossings is required .",
    "caustic crossings occur in pairs , and although the first caustic crossing may not be detected real time because of its short duration , it can be inferred afterwards from the enhanced magnification interior to the caustic .",
    "followup observations can therefore be prepared before the second caustic crossing , and dense sampling throughout the second caustic crossing will be possible .",
    "the usefulness of caustic - crossing binary - lens events has already been demonstrated in numerous ways .",
    "precise photometry during the caustic crossings of several events has been used to measure the limb darkening profiles of stars located in both the galactic bulge and the small magellanic cloud @xcite , and spectra taken during the unusually long caustic crossing of one event has been used to resolve the atmosphere of a @xmath33-giant in the bulge @xcite .",
    "it also has been proposed that irregular structures on the source star surface such as spots can be studied in detail by analyzing the light curves of caustic - crossing binary lens events @xcite . the same principles that make these measurements possible also allow one to study tiny structures on and around the planetary companions to the source stars of caustic - crossing events .    what is the ultimate resolution that can be obtained during a caustic crossing ?",
    "in geometric optics , this is set by the frequency of measurements and the number of photons that can be acquired in a given measurement , so that extremely small structures in the source plane could , in principle , be probed with sufficiently large telescopes and sufficiently high cadence",
    ". however , for very small sources , geometric optics breaks down , and diffraction effects become important . for a fold caustic crossing , this occurs when the angular size @xmath34 of the source in units of @xmath12 satisfies @xmath35 , where @xcite , @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the wavelength of the light . for @xmath38 ( @xmath39-band ) and @xmath40 , @xmath41 . for nearly equal - mass binaries , such as shown in figure [ fig : caustic ] , @xmath42 .",
    "thus the ultimate resolution achievable during a caustic - crossing is @xmath43 , or a length of @xmath44 at the distance of the bulge .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the size of any of the structures we consider here , so we can safely ignore diffraction effects .",
    "all of the planets in our solar system have at least one satellite , with the exceptions of mercury and venus , so it seems at least plausible that satellites are common by - products of the formation of planetary systems .",
    "satellites are perturbed by the tidal bulges they induce on their parent planets , and their orbits evolve under the influence of this torque .",
    "if the timescale for this evolution is sufficiently short , the satellite will either spiral inward until impacting with the parent planet , or outward until it reaches the hill radius of the planet , and is lost to the parent star .",
    "the survival of satellites has been considered by numerous authors in the context of our solar system ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied the lifetimes of satellites in the context of extrasolar planetary systems , and found that satellites with @xmath45 can not survive for more than @xmath46  gyr around jupiter - like planets with separations @xmath47 , assuming a solar - mass primary star .",
    "therefore relatively massive satellites around close - in planets are expected to be rare .",
    "however , the lifetime of satellites depends sensitively on the ( uncertain ) tidal @xmath48 value of the planet , and therefore may be significantly in error .",
    "furthermore , planets around lower - mass stars are expected to retain their satellites for a longer period of time .",
    "satellites of close - in planets are unlikely to have substantial atmospheres because their surface escape speeds are generally small enough that most light element gases will have evaporated over the age of the system .",
    "the equilibrium blackbody temperatures of satellites of planets with @xmath49 are @xmath50 , and any gases with an atomic mass less than @xmath51 ( including @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , will have been entirely lost over the @xmath54 age of the system for satellites with mass @xmath55 . therefore , the scattering surface of any extant satellite will likely be rocky .",
    "ring systems exist around all of the gas giants in our solar system , and therefore might also be expected to be common debris from planetary formation .",
    "the rings we observe in the solar system have varied properties , but at least some , such as the rings of saturn , are composed of icy materials which give rise to high albedos .",
    "such high albedos would aid considerably in detection in the current context .",
    "unfortunately ices can not exist as separations less than , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is luminosity of the parent star and @xmath58 is the sublimation temperature of ice .",
    "thus close - in planets can not have rings composed of icy material .",
    "rocky rings are not precluded ; however the constituent particles are subject to numerous dynamical forces , including poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag , viscous drag from the planet exosphere , torques from satellites and/or shepherd moons , and internal collisions .",
    "the characteristic decay time for pr - drag is @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the density and radius of the particles , respectively . for close - in planets ,",
    "the decay time @xmath62 for viscous drag is likely to be considerably larger than @xmath63 @xcite , unless the planet s exospheres are quite dense , @xmath64 .",
    "interparticle forces only serve to spread the ring .",
    "therefore , the dominant effect , aside from satellite perturbations , is likely to be pr drag .",
    "it is clear that rings of close - in planets will be lost to the planet on a relatively short timescale unless they are stabilized by interactions with satellites .",
    "since , as we have just discussed , satellites around close - in planets are themselves generally not long - lived , it is not clear that this is a viable method of maintaining rings .",
    "a definitive exploration of the stability of rings and satellite systems around close - in planets is beyond the scope of this paper , but warrants future study .",
    "an enormous amount of effort has been devoted to modeling of the atmospheres of extrasolar planets , with ever increasing levels of sophistication ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "special emphasis has been placed on close - in planets @xcite .",
    "the recent confrontation of observations of the radius and atmosphere of hd209458b @xcite with theoretical predictions @xcite generally indicates that considerably more work needs to be done @xcite .",
    "the problem of modeling the atmospheres of close - in planets is an especially difficult one , due to the fact that these planets are tidally locked to their parent stars , and subject to strong stellar irradiation .",
    "it seems likely that non - equilibrium processes , weather , and photoionization will all play a role in accurate theoretical models .",
    "it is therefore perhaps a bit premature to speculate on the existence and nature of surface features , such as zonal bands and spots , on extrasolar planets .",
    "there are intriguing indications , however , that close - in planets may possess large - scale surface features . @xcite and @xcite showed that the extreme day - night temperature difference in close - in , synchronized planets drive large - scale zonal winds that can reach @xmath65",
    ". these circulation patterns result in non - uniform surface temperatures which may lead to significant variations in the scattering , reflecting , and absorbing properties of the atmosphere .",
    "regardless of whether or not surface irregularities exist on extrasolar planets , it is clear that a uniform surface brightness , which has been assumed in previous microlensing simulations @xcite , will likely not be an accurate representation of the global illumination pattern of the planet . even for simple lambert scattering ,",
    "in which each area element of the planetary atmosphere reflects the incident flux uniformly back into the @xmath66 available solid angle , the surface brightness profile of the planet is non - uniform due to projection effects . departures from lambert scattering are expected , and depend on such properties as the particle size of the condensates in the atmosphere @xcite .    to summarize , it remains unclear whether satellites or ring systems can exist around close - in extrasolar planets .",
    "models of the close - in planetary atmospheres have not yet reached the level of sophistication required to definitively predict whether large - scale surface features such as zonal bands or spots will be present .",
    "it seems quite likely , however , that the surface brightness profile of extrasolar planets will _ not _ be uniform , as has previously been assumed when calculating the effects of microlensing .",
    "we will therefore proceed with rampant optimism , and assume that all of the above structures , ( rings , moons , zonal bands , spots , and non - uniform surface brightness profiles ) may exist , and consider the nature and magnitude of their effects on microlensing light curves .",
    "in this section , we estimate the magnitude of the features in lensing light curves produced by satellites , rings , and atmospheric features , relative to the nominal light curve produced by an isolated , circular planet with uniform surface brightness . for the most part",
    ", we use semi - analytic means to produce quantitative estimates in order to elucidate the dependence of the deviations on the parameters of the system .",
    "however , in some cases the signals can not be computed analytically .",
    "we therefore complement our semi - analytic results with detailed numerical simulations .",
    "the time - dependent total flux @xmath67 from a system composed of a star and @xmath68 additional source components being microlensed can be generically written as , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the unlensed flux of the star , @xmath71 is the magnification of the star , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the unlensed flux and magnification of the @xmath74th additional component ( which may include planets , satellites , rings , etc . ) , and @xmath75 is any unlensed blended flux .",
    "we will henceforth assume no blending , but note that any deviation in the light curve is suppressed in the presence of blending by a factor @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the ratio of blend to total source flux , and @xmath78 is the total magnification in the absence of blending .    generally , we have that @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , and thus the observed magnification can be approximated as @xmath81 where we have defined @xmath82 , the extra magnification due to the planetary companion and associated structures , and the flux ratio @xmath83 between the @xmath74th component and the star .    for a uniform , circular source sufficiently close to a linear fold caustic , the magnification is @xcite , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the normal distance of the source from the caustic in units of the source size .",
    "the function @xmath86 describes the normalized light curve for a uniform , circular source crossing a fold caustic , and can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals @xcite .",
    "it is useful because it can be used to describe the magnification of any source that can decomposed into components with azimuthal symmetry .",
    "@xmath87 has a maximum of @xmath88 at @xmath89 . in the range @xmath90 , the mean value of @xmath86 is @xmath91 and",
    "the rms is @xmath92 .",
    "the magnification can also be written as a function of time by defining @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the time when the center of the source crosses the caustic , and @xmath96 is the angle of the trajectory with respect to the caustic , and the timescale of the caustic crossing is @xmath97 . here",
    "@xmath98 is the timescale of the primary event , and @xmath99 is the relative lens - source proper motion .    for typical microlensing events toward the galactic bulge , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and thus @xmath102 .",
    "we will assume that the primary source is a g - dwarf in the bulge , i.e.  that it has a radius @xmath103 and is located at the distance @xmath104 .",
    "the angular radius is @xmath105 , and thus the dimensionless source size is @xmath106 .",
    "the caustic crossing timescale for a source of physical radius @xmath107 is , @xmath108 thus the primary caustic crossing is expected to last @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "the largest contribution to @xmath82 generally will be from the planet itself , @xmath111 . in the case of light reflected by a planetary atmosphere or surface , the flux fraction @xmath112 will depend on the radius @xmath113 of the planet , its distance @xmath114 from the star , the scattering properties of the atmosphere , and the phase of the planet .",
    "generically , the flux ratio @xmath112 between the planet and star can be written as @xcite , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the phase angle , defined as the angle between the star and earth as seen from the planet , @xmath117 is the phase function , and @xmath118 is the flux ratio at @xmath119 , @xmath120 here @xmath121 is the geometric albedo of the planet . for a lambert sphere , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",

    "the surface brightness , in turn , depends on the phase of the planet , as well as the scattering properties of the atmosphere .",
    "the effects of the phase of the planet on the magnification have been considered by @xcite , and we consider the effects of lambert - sphere scattering on the magnification in  [ sec : lambert ] .",
    "we will therefore assume that the planet has a uniform surface brightness and is at full phase ( @xmath119 and thus @xmath125 ) , unless otherwise stated .",
    "in this case , the magnification of the planet is simply given by , with @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the angular radius of the planet in units of @xmath12 .",
    "adopting this expression , the contribution of the perturbation from the planet is , @xmath128 note that we have assumed that @xmath129 . in most cases , @xmath28 is of order unity , and this will be an excellent approximation .",
    "we will furthermore assume that @xmath130 in deriving all analytic expressions . during the planetary caustic crossing , the rms .",

    "thus the magnitude of the deviation is given by the coefficients of the @xmath87 function in , @xmath132 for binary lenses with caustic structures similar to that shown in figure [ fig : caustic ] , @xmath27 is of order unity @xcite .",
    "thus for typical microlensing bulge parameters , @xmath133 , and for a planet with properties similar to hd209458b ( @xmath134 and @xmath135 , @xcite ) , and @xmath122 , @xmath136 . from , the duration of planetary caustic crossing is @xmath137 for @xmath134 .",

    "the ratio @xmath146 will depend quite strongly on the compositions of the planet and satellite . as we argued in ",

    "numerical integration must be employed in order to calculate the magnification of the ring .",
    "we consider sources crossing the second caustic of the dashed trajectory in figure  [ fig : caustic ] .",
    "to calculate the light curve , we first compute the full binary - lens magnification on each area element on the surface of the source and then average the magnifications of the individual elements , weighting by the surface brightness of each element .",

    "we then investigate the variations of the pattern of ring - induced anomalies depending on these various factors affecting the shape of the ring .    defining the projected shape of a ringed planet",

    "all of the systems have a common inner ring radius and gap between the planet disk and the ring , but different outer ring radii .",
    "we have also assumed that the ring system is viewed at an angle of @xmath186 with respect to the normal to the ring plane .",
    "not surprisingly , increasing the width of the ring increases the magnitude and duration of the ring - induced perturbation .",
    "figure [ fig : ring3 ] shows the dependence of the ring - induced anomaly pattern on the albedo of the ring particles .",
    "we test three different albedos of @xmath187 , 0.1 , and 0.2 ( corresponding to @xmath188 , 0.3 , and 0.6 ) , and the difference in the greyscale of the rings in the icons represents the variation of the albedo .",
    "as expected , the magnitude of the ring signal is proportional to the albedo of ring particles .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ring4 ] , we demonstrate the effects of a shadow cast on the ring by the planet . in this case",
    ", we must also take into account the phase of the planet to be self - consistent .",
    "for the geometry depicted in figure [ fig : ring4 ] , the planet is at quarter phase .",
    "we find that the shape of the part of the light curve arising from the planet is strongly dependent on the phase of the planet , as discussed in detail by @xcite , however the shape of the signal due the ring does not depend strongly on the effect of the shadow of the planet , due to the relatively small surface area of the ring occulted by the planet .    from the light curves in figures [ fig : ring2 ] ",
    "[ fig : ring4 ] , we conclude that the typical magnitude of ring - induced deviations is @xmath189 , confirming our analytic estimates , although there are considerable variations depending on the inclination and size of the ring .",
    "in contrast to the signatures of satellites and rings , atmospheric features that are located on the surface of the planet will only produce detectable deviations while the planet is resolved .",
    "the planet is only effectively resolved when it is within about one planet radius from the caustic .",
    "therefore , deviations caused by spots , bands , or otherwise non - uniform surface brightness profiles will only be noticeable during a time @xmath190 centered on the caustic crossing ; outside of this the flux from the planet will essentially be given by the unresolved flux ( i.e.  the mean surface brightness times the area of the planet disk ) times the magnification of a point - source at the center of the planet disk .",
    "spots , such as the great red spot on jupiter , have been observed on the gas giants in our solar system , and are regions of cyclonic activity that have slightly different temperatures and pressures from their surrounding atmospheres . as a result ,",
    "the colors and albedos of spots are also slightly different .",
    "these spots can be quite large relative to the planetary radii ; the great red spot has a size larger than @xmath191 . in this subsection",
    ", we provide an analytic estimate of the effect of a spot on the microlensing light curve .",
    "we model the spot as a circle of radius @xmath192 , with an albedo equal to a fraction @xmath193 of the albedo of the remainder of the planetary surface .",
    "the deviation caused by the spot is then , @xmath194 \\right\\}. \\label{eqn : dasp}\\ ] ] note that , in deriving , the mean surface brightness of the spotted planet has been normalized to that of the planet without the spot .",
    "this ensures that the magnifications of the two cases are identical when the source is not resolved . that this is true can be seen by noting that , for @xmath195 , the term in square brackets goes to zero , because @xmath196 .",
    "since we are generally concerned with small spots with @xmath197 , we can make an estimate of the magnitude @xmath198 of the deviation caused by the spot by ignoring terms in of order @xmath199 or higher , and looking at the resulting coefficient to the @xmath200 function .",
    "we find that @xmath201 for @xmath202 , and @xmath203 ( @xmath150 for @xmath204 ) , we find @xmath205 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spot ] , we show the total magnification @xmath82 , with and without a spot of radius @xmath203 and relative albedo @xmath202 . we have adopted the same parameters as in  ",
    "[ sec : satellites ] and [ sec : rings ] , @xmath177 and @xmath156 .",
    "we vary the position of the spot as shown .",
    "we also show @xmath206 , the deviation caused by the spot from the light curve of a planet with uniform surface brightness .",
    "we find the magnitude of the deviation caused by the spot to be @xmath207 , in rough agreement with our analytic estimate .",
    "since , for linear fold caustics , the magnification is independent of position along the direction parallel to the caustic , the results in figure [ fig : spot ] are applicable for any circular spot located on the star at the same perpendicular distance from the caustic as the spots shown .",
    "microlensing of spotted planets is analogous to microlensing of spotted stars , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for examples of such lightcurves .",
    "as can be seen on the surface of jupiter , gaseous giant planets may exhibit color variations on their surface , e.g.  zonal bands , which will cause surface brightness variations within a given spectral band . in this subsection",
    ", we investigate whether zonal bands can produce noticeable signatures in lensing light curves .",
    "we model zonal bands by stripes which are parallel with the equator of the planet .",
    "we assume that the albedos of these stripes alternate with relative values @xmath208 , and we vary the total number of stripes .",
    "analytic estimates are generally impossible for arbitrary inclinations of the planet , however , for the special case when the planet is seen pole - in , the pattern of the zonal bands is simply concentric annuli with alternating albedos . in this case , we can find a semi - analytic expression for the deviation from a uniform surface brightness due to the zonal bands .",

    "fig : band1 ] , we show the total magnification @xmath82 of the planet , with and without @xmath211 bands with relative albedos @xmath219 , similar to that of the jupiter @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the same parameters as in the previous sections , except here we consider the second caustic crossing of the solid trajectory in figure  [ fig : caustic ] , which has the properties @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "this yields @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "we vary the number of bands from @xmath224 , and the bands have equally - spaced radii ( and thus cover different surface areas on the source ) .",
    "we also show @xmath225 , the normalized deviation caused by the banded structure from the light curve of a planet with uniform surface brightness .",
    "we find the magnitude of the deviation caused by the bands to be @xmath226 here the scaling with @xmath208 is only approximate .",
    "the scaling with @xmath211 depends on the geometry of the zones ; @xmath227 for zones with equally - spaced @xmath212 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band1 ] ) , whereas @xmath228 for equal - area bands . for equal - area zones ,",
    "the numerical coefficient in is also somewhat smaller , @xmath229 .    for geometries where the planet is not pole - on",
    ", we must resort to numerical calculations .",
    "for these calculations , we assume a total of nine bands ( with four dark lanes ) , with relative albedos of @xmath219 , as in the previous example .",
    "the albedos are normalized such that the average albedo is @xmath230 .",
    "figure [ fig : band2 ] shows the effect of zonal bands for a planet with inclination @xmath231 ( i.e. the axis of rotation in the plane of the sky ) , and various orientations of the equator with respect to the caustic . as before , we assume the source trajectory indicated by the solid line in figure [ fig : caustic ] . the solid curve is the light curve resulting from a planet having a uniform surface brightness with @xmath121 . from the figure , one finds that the deviations induced by the zonal bands are @xmath232 , similar to the pole - on case . note that these deviations are generally an order of magnitude smaller than the typical deviations induced by rings .      even without any irregular structure ,",
    "the surface brightness profile of a planet will generally not be uniform due to projection effects , and the scattering properties of the atmosphere .",
    "the surface brightness distribution will therefore vary depending on the latitude @xmath233 and longitude @xmath234 of the planet s surface as well as the planet s phase angle , @xmath116 . to illustrate the pattern of lensing light curve deviations caused by a realistic atmosphere",
    ", we adopt the simple assumption of pure lambert scattering , where the incident radiation from the host star is scattered isotropically . under this assumption",
    ", it can be shown that the surface brightness profile is @xmath235 for @xmath236 and zero otherwise @xcite . here",
    "@xmath237 is the mean surface brightness of the planet , and @xmath117 is the phase integral introduced in  [ sec : planet ] and displayed explicitly in .",
    "we show the surface brightness distribution for a lambert sphere with @xmath119 in figure [ fig : lambert ] , along with the resulting microlensing light curve . as in  [ sec : zonal ] , we have assumed the solid source trajectory in figure [ fig : caustic ] .",
    "we compare this to the light curve resulting from a planet with a uniform surface brightness and an albedo equal to the geometric albedo of the lambert sphere ( i.e.  @xmath122 ) .",
    "we find that the light curve of a lambert sphere differs from a uniform surface brightness profile by @xmath238 .",
    "the light curve from a lambert sphere is more highly magnified , due to the fact that the surface brightness profile is more centrally concentrated , and therefore the source is effectively smaller .",
    "the precise shape of the light curve from the planet will depend on the scattering properties of the atmosphere , which in turn depend on the constituents of the atmosphere , such as the size of the condensates @xcite .",
    "therefore resolution of the planetary caustic crossing would provide invaluable information about the physical processes in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "this is complementary to the suggestion by @xcite of probing the planetary atmosphere via polizarization monitoring during the planetary caustic crossing .",
    "in this section , we review the magnitudes of the effects of the features we have considered , and assess their detectability with current and/or future telescopes . table [ tbl : table1 ] summarizes our analytic expressions for the magnitudes @xmath239 of the deviations caused by each structure @xmath240 that we considered ( satellites , rings , spots , and zonal bands ) , in terms of the magnitude @xmath241 of the deviation due to only the planet .",
    "also shown is the characteristic timescale @xmath242 of each deviation , relative to the timescale of the planetary caustic crossing @xmath243 .    by approximating the perturbations from each structure @xmath240 as boxcars with amplitudes @xmath239 and durations @xmath242 , we can write down _ approximate _ expressions for the ratio of the signal - to - noise @xmath244 for a given perturbation to the signal - to - noise of the planetary pertrubation , @xmath245 these ratios are displayed in table [ tbl : table1 ] ; they allow one to easily estimate the detectability of the various features in terms of the detectability of the planetary deviation .",
    "for example , if one were to require a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath246 for a secure detection of the planet signal , then signal - to - noise of the deviation from a ring with relative albedo @xmath174 and relative ( outer ) radius of @xmath247 would be @xmath248 . for reasonable parameters",

    "the term in curly brackets is essentially the rms of the deviation during the time of the observations .",
    "we assume that the source system is an analog of hd20458 at @xmath257 kpc .",
    "the primary has @xmath258 ( a g0v star at @xmath259 kpc with 1.2 magnitudes of extinction ) , and its planet has @xmath134 , @xmath260 , and @xmath122 . adopting typical bulge parameters ( @xmath261 ) , and a caustic crossing with properties @xmath262 and @xmath263 , this gives @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",

    "finally , we assume that the light curve is monitored from @xmath272 before the caustic crossing until @xmath273 after the caustic crossing of the primary star , for a total duration of @xmath274min .",
    "the resulting signal - to - noise values for the various deviations are tabulated in table [ tbl : table1 ] . for 10m - class telescopes ,",
    "the deviation from the planet should be detectable with @xmath275 .",
    "this is in rough agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite for full phases .",
    "however , @xcite find that the signal - to - noise depends quite strongly on the phase of the planet . adopting a different phase",
    "would therefore affect the relative signal - to - noise @xmath276 between the planet and the satellite , ring , spot or band features , but generally not the absolute signal - to - noise @xmath244 .",
    "for the deviations from the other structures , we have adopted the parameter values appropriate to the short - dashed line in figure [ fig : sat ] for the satellite , the dotted line in figure [ fig : ring1 ] for the ring , the short - dashed line in figure [ fig : spot ] for the spot , and the long - dashed line in figure [ fig : band1 ] for the zonal bands .",
    "for these perturbations we find signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath277 ( satellite ) , @xmath278 ( ring ) , @xmath279 ( spot ) , and @xmath280 ( zonal bands ) .",
    "these are in rough agreement with the expected scaling with @xmath281 , and generally indicate that it will be impossible to detect spots , bands , and satellites with 10m - class telescopes .",
    "rings are potentially detectable , but only under somewhat optimistic scenarios , i.e.  large , face - on rings .",

    "<S> the detailed shapes of these perturbations are sensitive to fine structures on and around the planets . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the signatures of rings , satellites , and atmospheric features on caustic - crossing microlensing light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for reasonable assumptions , rings produce deviations of order @xmath3 , whereas satellites , spots , and zonal bands produce deviations of order @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the detectability of these features using current and future telescopes , and find that , with very large apertures ( @xmath530 m ) , ring systems may be detectable , whereas spots , satellites , and zonal bands will generally be difficult to detect . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a short discussion of the stability of rings around close - in planets , noting that rings are likely to be lost to poynting - robertson drag on a timescale of order @xmath6 years , unless they are composed of large ( @xmath71  cm ) particles , or are stabilized by satellites . </S>"
