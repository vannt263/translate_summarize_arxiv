    "in @xcite , @xcite glasser and davison consider the following problem : let @xmath0 and @xmath1 are two disjoint balls in @xmath2 with equal radii .",
    "let @xmath3 be a distance between the balls .",
    "consider a harmonic function in the complement of the balls , i.e. , @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the heat flux where @xmath8 is the outward unit normal vector to a sphere .",
    "is it true that the quantity @xmath9 is increasing as the function of distance between the balls ?",
    "the problem arises from the question why certain warm blooded animals like armadillos can keep each other warm by huddling together . in this simple model",
    "the balls @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent uniform spherical animals in @xmath2 with body temperature 1 and medium temperature 0 . the harmonic function @xmath10 represents time independent temperature in @xmath11 , and the quantity @xmath9 represents the total heat loss of both animals : the total amount of heat given off by the animals as a function of distance between the balls . presumably moving animals",
    "closer together decreases the heat loss @xmath9 , and it was confirmed numerically in @xcite that the quantity @xmath9 is increasing . however no mathematical proof was given until a.  eremenko @xcite gave a rigorous proof in more general setting . in eremenko",
    "s argument it was noticed that @xmath12 where @xmath13 the monotonicity of @xmath14 follows from the fact that if @xmath15 is continuous , one - to - one , and @xmath16 then @xmath17 where @xmath18 for any borel measurable @xmath19 .",
    "notice that each individual animal @xmath20 feels only his own heat loss @xmath21 @xmath22 but not the total @xmath23",
    ". therefore the behavior of the animals we have discussed could be driven by individual feelings but not the abstract `` common goal '' . in case of equal balls the individual heat loss @xmath24",
    "is monotonically increasing because @xmath25 .",
    "it is natural to think that the individual heat loss @xmath24 is monotonically increasing for the balls of different radii . in @xcite",
    "the following question was asked :    are the quantities @xmath26 @xmath27 monotonically increasing if the balls have different radii ?    in section  [ computation ] we will show that if @xmath28 denotes the radius of the ball @xmath20 for @xmath27 , then the of heat loss @xmath29 is not monotonically increasing provided that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the positive solution of the equation @xmath32 in the above notation @xmath33 is the euler s constant , and @xmath34 is the digamma function .    in other words ,",
    "if armadillo a is at least twice as big as armadillo b , then a should keep some nonzero distance from b in order to minimize the heat loss while b should try to be as close as possible to a.    in section  [ computation ] we obtain the following asymptotic expression for @xmath35 which implies the conclusion ( [ shedegi ] ) .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath3 , and let the temperature of the balls be constant and equal to @xmath37",
    ". then @xmath38+o(d).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath39 .",
    "we consider a bispherical coordinate system @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 so that the foci @xmath45 and @xmath46 coincide with the centers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . a general solution of the laplace equation in bispherical coordinate system ( under the assumptions that the solution does not depend on @xmath47 which is true in our case ) is given by the expression ( see page 1298 , @xcite ) @xmath48p_{n}(\\cos \\eta ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are legandre polynomials .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 be the radii of @xmath0 and @xmath1 correspondingly .",
    "the corresponding values of the @xmath52 coordinate @xmath53 on @xmath54 and @xmath55 on @xmath56 will be determined by @xmath57 for @xmath27 .",
    "notice also that the distance @xmath58 between the balls can be obtained as follows @xmath59    assume that the temperature on @xmath60 is a constant @xmath61 , @xmath27 . then by using the generating function for the legandre polynomials @xmath62 the boundary condition @xmath63 implies @xmath64    let us compute the surface element @xmath65 in the bispherical coordinates : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the last inequality follows because the signs of the coefficients of the polynomial alternate , and @xmath194 .",
    "it follows from the previous section that if @xmath195 ( where @xmath196 is a positive solution of ( [ shedegi ] ) ) then the heat loss of the big ball , i.e. , @xmath35 is decreasing when @xmath197 where @xmath198 is sufficiently small .",
    "notice that when @xmath199 we have @xmath200 , and @xmath201 therefore @xmath202 and thus @xmath203 the last inequality is justified because @xmath204 for @xmath205 follows from the fact that @xmath206 for @xmath207 .",
    "so there exists a minimal value of @xmath35 on @xmath208 , i.e. , a nonzero distance when the heat loss of the big ball is minimal .",
    "the numerical computations show that , in fact @xmath35 is decreasing on the interval @xmath209 and then it is increasing on @xmath210 where @xmath211 .",
    "the heat loss of the small ball @xmath212 is always increasing for @xmath213 .",
