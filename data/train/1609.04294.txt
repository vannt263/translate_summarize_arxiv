    "<S> we introduce a measure of fixed - node ( fn ) bias cancellation useful for a priori assessment of fn diffusion monte carlo ( fn - dmc ) energy differences , based on post - hartree - fock natural orbital occupation numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed quantity reflects the non - equivalency of static correlations in trial wave functions and uncovers the nature of biases observed in some small noncovalent complexes .    </S>",
    "<S> _ motivation : _ fixed - node diffusion monte carlo ( fn - dmc ) is a projector many - body electronic structure method@xcite , promising for its accuracy , massive parallelism , low - order cpu cost scaling and direct treatment of extended models@xcite . for a given hamiltonian @xmath0 , fn - dmc projects out the ground - state @xmath1 that has non - zero overlap with the antisymmetric trial state @xmath2 , in imaginary @xmath3 in real space , fn - dmc captures symmetric correlations exactly , and the accuracy of fermi states is limited by the location of the supplied approximate node @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a 3@xmath6 dimensional vector of electron positions . </S>",
    "<S> the total fn - dmc energy is an upper bound to the exact energy ( which would result if the node would be exact ) and the related bias , fn bias , scales quadratically with the nodal displacement error@xcite . in principle , @xmath2 can be systematically improved so that the related fn bias becomes negligible , however , with increasing system size , such an approach eventually becomes unreliable . </S>",
    "<S> the practical fn - dmc approaches available for large systems therefore rely on compact yet effective @xmath2s like slater - jastrow anstze , containing explicitly correlated single or a few determinants@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fn - dmc with single determinant @xmath2s recently led to accurate single - point interaction energies ( vs. ccsd(t)/cbs ) , @xmath7 , in a number of small _ noncovalent _ closed - shell complexes@xcite , which was attributed to high degree of fn bias cancellation operative in the limit of `` sufficiently '' weak interactions@xcite . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , the energy differences are dominated by the changes in low - density intermolecular region / s with predominant @xmath8 character where the exchange contributions are negligible@xcite , in line with the expected dependence of fn errors on electron density and node non - linearity@xcite , and the non - negligible valence inaccuracies cancel out in energy differences .    for this property , fn - dmc with economic single - determinant </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2s has a potential to become a benchmark method in area of noncovalent interactions , complementary to the existing approaches . </S>",
    "<S> however , limits of fn bias cancellation are yet unknown . </S>",
    "<S> non - negligible deviations of unknown nature found in noncovalent complexes with multiply bound hydrogen bond acceptors@xcite , like hcn dimer or formaldehyde ( fd ) dimer , start to delineate limits of this approach and motivate our further elaborations in this area .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the difference of fn - dmc interaction energy ( @xmath9 ) from the exact result ( @xmath7 , see _ definitions _ ) , @xmath10 can be expressed as a sum of contributions , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a stochastic bias , @xmath13 is a sampling error related to non - ergodicity of @xmath2s , @xmath14 is a fn bias , @xmath15 relates to the quality of ecp constructions and treatment of ecps in fn - dmc , @xmath16 is a finite time - step bias , and , other yet unknown possible biases are denoted as @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results reported to date for small single - reference@xcite closed - shell noncovalent complexes@xcite lead us to believe that the discrepancies @xmath18 of the order of 0.3 kcal / mol ( relative errors exceeding 7% ) observed in hcn and fd dimers@xcite , unacceptable at the benchmark level ( relative errors up to 2 - 3% ) , relate to @xmath14 and/or @xmath17 , since @xmath12 can be ruled out by sufficient convergence of error bars ( @xmath19  kcal / mol ) , @xmath13 is diminished by the use of correlation - adjusted dft orbitals@xcite and diffuse functions@xcite , @xmath15 is negligible by the quality of ecp constructions@xcite and the use of three - body jastrow factors@xcite in @xmath2s , and , the time - step bias does not appear to be the root cause@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we suspect , that the main source of the mentioned discrepancies stems from the inequivalent treatment of static correlation effects in molecular clusters vs. their constituents . </S>",
    "<S> since fn - dmc with single - determinant @xmath2s strictly neglects static correlations ( contrary to coupled cluster employing the low - rank substitutions ) , @xmath14 becomes non - negligible even in `` single - reference '' cases where the interacting and non - interacting states possess sufficiently different static correlation character ( like , e.g. , hcn dimer , as shown below ) . </S>",
    "<S> an extreme example would be the case of covalent bond breaking with spin uncoupling like atomization ( e.g. , n@xmath20n+n ) , which requires large number of determinants to achieve converged fn - dmc energy differences@xcite , simply because the individual ( ground ) states ( of n@xmath21 and n in our example ) are of different nature owing to their spin multiplicity and/or near - degeneracy .    </S>",
    "<S> non - equivalence of static correlations ignored in single - determinant @xmath2s used for evaluations of the fn - dmc energy differences should clearly be understood . </S>",
    "<S> this requires reference post - hartree - fock ( post - hf ) calculations and definition of an appropriate measure . as shown below , the so - called @xmath22 diagnostic@xcite that detects near - degeneracies in coupled - cluster ccsd computations , </S>",
    "<S> is not suitable for this purpose .    </S>",
    "<S> here we define an alternative measure detecting multi - reference character , based on correlated post - hf natural orbital occupation numbers ( noons ) , that enables a priori quantification of the expected degree of fn bias cancellation in fn - dmc energy differences . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity proposed here reflects the differences of omitted static correlations between @xmath2s of a supersystem vs. its non - interacting couterparts , irrespective of theory and excitation order , conforms with observations , and , provides unprecedented insights to the nature of @xmath14 in noncovalent systems .    </S>",
    "<S> _ definitions : _ below , we focus on ( noncovalent ) interaction energies , defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the total energies of the supersystem @xmath26 ( e.g. molecular cluster ) and its non - interacting counterpart @xmath27        ( e.g. molecules constituting a molecular cluster @xmath26 , sufficiently separated or treated independently ) with geometries same as in @xmath26 ( i.e. the deformation energy is not taken into account ) , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the discrete representation @xmath28 of the coordinate - space one - electron reduced density matrix@xcite @xmath29 corresponding to post - hf solutions expanded in an orthonormal basis of spatial orbitals @xmath30 , @xmath31 may be diagonalized in order to obtain @xmath32 i.e. the set of nos @xmath33 and the corresponding noons @xmath34 normalized to the number of considered electrons @xmath6 , @xmath35 , that reflect the pauli@xcite and generalized pauli principle@xcite , and , account for the spin - degeneracy : @xmath36 . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we use the @xmath37 vectors ordered in ascending way , i.e. @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total number of one - particle basis functions .    for a given hamiltonian , we define an euclidean distance ( motivated by ref .  ) @xmath40 between the @xmath37-vector from the qualitatively correct correlated size - consistent post - hf computation , and , the mean - field point @xmath41 corresponding to the occupation of a trial state used in . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for a closed - shell slater determinant , . therefore , @xmath42 measures neglect of static correlation effects in the trial state @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we rescale @xmath42 so that it becomes size - intensive , @xmath43 where , from now on , @xmath6 is the number of explicitly correlated electrons in post - hf treatment .    </S>",
    "<S> we define a differential measure of the omitted amount of static correlations relevant to energy differences , @xmath44 that is based on scaled distances @xmath45 and @xmath46 obtained for the supersystem @xmath26 , and its non - intereacting counterpart @xmath27 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this may be compared to the analogous difference of @xmath22 diagnostics , @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we define a tentative measure valid for molecular dimers in equilibrium , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a maximum bond multiplicity of a contact atom corresponding to the constituent @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of @xmath49s is to qualitatively reflect the expected rise of fn bias with higher bond multiplicity@xcite . in linear hcn dimer , for instance , @xmath51 and @xmath52 since the hydrogen bond ( contact ) consists of triply - bound nitrogen and hydrogen .    </S>",
    "<S> _ small noncovalent complexes : _     ( kcal / mol ) , @xmath22 diagnostics for dimolecular complexes @xmath26 ( supersystem , yellow ) and non - interacting constituents @xmath27 ( cyan ) and their differences @xmath53 , rescaled noon - space distances of the correlated post - hf occupations from the mean - field ( @xmath54 ) , their differences ( @xmath55 ) , and , the corresponding bond - multiplicity - rescaled differences @xmath56 ( see _ definitions_).,width=245 ]    let us now demonstrate the performance of the introduced quantities , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , here derived from the frozen - core ccsd / aug - vdz ( the convergence vs. the basis set saturation is rapid , see _ appendix _ ) , on a set of eleven single - reference closed - shell complexes ( figure  [ figres ] , left ) where the statistically converged single - determinant fn - dmc results employing three - body jastrows are available@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fn - dmc results are compared to the accurate ccsd(t)/cbs@xcite data , and we assume that @xmath57    according to its definition , for the given hamiltonian , @xmath54 is proportional to the distance of the correlated many - body solution from the mean - field state corresponding to @xmath2 , in the space of noons . in our systems , @xmath54s are typically smaller for trivially saturated closed - shell complexes and higher for complexes containing @xmath58 bonds , and change only mildly between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( figure  1 , @xmath45 vs. @xmath46 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the largest values were found for ethyne dimer and hcn dimer , both containing a maximum ( triple ) bond multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> this is rather promising , since the @xmath22 diagnostic does not reveal such intuitively acceptable trends . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , @xmath59s for fh are larger than for some @xmath58-complexes .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the quantities relevant to energy differences . </S>",
    "<S> the measure @xmath55 provides the key insights of this work . according to its definition ( eq .  [ dd ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we expect larger @xmath60 in systems where @xmath61 is larger and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the results show such trends , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that in cases where fn - dmc works well , i.e. where @xmath18 is small ( figure  [ figres ] , left , @xmath55 vs. @xmath18 ) , @xmath55 is small . in systems with larger discrepancies , @xmath55 is larger , and it is most prominent for hcn and fd . </S>",
    "<S> , again , that @xmath53 does not show any clear trends . since other sources of bias in these complexes can be ruled out , @xmath55 strongly indicates that the disagreement observed in these complexes is caused by the significant non - equivalence of static correlations omitted in one - determinant @xmath2s and consequent less systematic fn bias cancellation in energy differences , in contrast to the complexes where @xmath55 is small .    </S>",
    "<S> it looks that for hcn and fd , single - determinant fn - dmc reaches its limits ( assuming optimal orbitals ) . </S>",
    "<S> one way to achieve a higher accuracy is an improvement of @xmath2s by adding more determinants . alternatively </S>",
    "<S> , one can explore more systems and hope for universal trends as a function of interaction strength and/or bond multiplicity and develop some sort of empirical correction .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to observe that the sign of @xmath55 alters in the same way as @xmath18 in _ all _ the considered cases . </S>",
    "<S> positive @xmath55 consistent with overbinding shows up in cases where the state @xmath27 has a more near - degenerate character than @xmath26 , that is a case of hcn and fd . </S>",
    "<S> this clarifies why fn - dmc sometimes under- and sometimes overestimates the energy differences .    </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath55 is a very promising quantity , it is a bit disturbing that it is sometimes similar for complexes where fn - dmc behaves in a qualitative different way . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath55 in trivially saturated fh dimer , where one - determinant fn - dmc leads to benchmark results , is similar to @xmath55 in hcn dimer , where the method exceedingly overestimates @xmath7 . it would be desirable to develop a quantity that would be able to discern such cases , and allow assessment of fn - dmc data without resorting to reference cbs data . </S>",
    "<S> we thus propose to use another measure , based on @xmath55 , reflecting also the fact that fn errors depend on electron density@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this requires a deeper study , as an example , we define here an empirical measure @xmath56 that progressively depends on a maximum bond multiplicity of terminal atoms constituing noncovalent contact / s ( eq .  [ eqr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity can be used to sort the complexes , according to the empirically chosen critical value ( here @xmath62 ) , into two categories : safe @xmath63 , and , possibly problematic @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> visually , on the scale of figure  [ figres ] ( left ) , the two classes emerge : `` small '' bars , and , `` appreciable '' bars ( dimers of hcn , fd ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 thus indicates that the quality of fn - dmc results in hcn and fd can not be guaranteed . </S>",
    "<S> we note here , that analogs of @xmath56 are desired for blind assessment of fn - dmc energy differences , and , indeed , more rigorous and general definition / s ( valid for potential surface scans or clusters with more contacts ) should explicitly depend on fragment distance and/or electron density ( e.g. , at bond critical points ) instead of @xmath65s .    </S>",
    "<S> _ larger noncovalent complexes : _ we now test the new measures in larger , benzene ( bz ) containing complexes , bz - h@xmath21o , bz - ch@xmath66 , parallel - displaced bz@xmath21 ( bz@xmath67 ) , and , t - shaped bz@xmath21 ( bz@xmath68 ) . according to @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( at ccsd / aug - vdz level ) , single - determinant fn - dmc should underestimate @xmath7 in bz - ch@xmath66 and bz@xmath67 , and , overestimate in bz - h@xmath21o and bz@xmath68 ( figure  [ figres ] , right ) , in agreement with the best available @xmath18s . according to @xmath56 ( @xmath69 ) , </S>",
    "<S> accurate energy differences are expected for bz - ch@xmath66 , bz - h@xmath21o , and , bz@xmath68 , where the observed biases are most probably of statistical nature . on the other hand , appreciable @xmath56 in bz@xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> indicates that its @xmath7 will be somewhat underestimated , in agreement with the available data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for the two variants of bz@xmath21 , @xmath56 shows that bz@xmath67 has a more pronounced and non - negligible differential multireference character , making the fn bias compensation of single - determinant fn - dmc in this complex less efficient . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 thus clarifies why fn - dmc in bz@xmath68 produces fn - dmc results in a good agreement with the reference@xcite , contrary to bz@xmath67@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ covalent bond breaking : _ finally , we explore the performance of @xmath55 applied to atomization of n@xmath21 vs. si@xmath21 , where the single - determinant fn - dmc shows vastly different deviations from the reference@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while in si@xmath21 fn - dmc underbinds by about 1 kcal / mol , it does even more so in n@xmath21 where @xmath18 achieves as much as 7 kcal / mol ( table  i ) . </S>",
    "<S> altough @xmath54s are comparable to the above - mentioned noncovalent systems ( 1.9 - 5@xmath70 vs. 2 - 5@xmath70 , table  [ tabres ] ) , @xmath55s are significantly more pronounced ( 1 - 3@xmath70 vs. maximum value of 6.5@xmath71 observed in fd , table  [ tabres ] ) that is consistent ( including the correct sign ) with the larger bias observed in energy differences , vs. the same in noncovalent complexes studied above . in addition , @xmath55 for n@xmath21 is almost three times higher than the value for si@xmath21 , indicating significantly less efficient fn bias cancellation in this case , and , qualitatively correct trend when compared to the available energy differences . altogether </S>",
    "<S> , for atomization of these two molecules , consistency of @xmath55 with the available fn - dmc data presumably indicates that @xmath55-based measures may also find use in covalent bond - breaking scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the @xmath56 in bond breaking situations , its definition in terms of @xmath65s requires more care and we postpone its evaluations to the follow - up work . </S>",
    "<S> _ summary : _ we defined noon - based measures proportional to the differential amount of static correlations omitted in @xmath2s and useful for a priori assessment of expected fn bias in fn - dmc energy differences . </S>",
    "<S> the use of noons guarantees generality and universality across various size - consistent methods ( e.g. ccsd , cas - scf , full ci ) . </S>",
    "<S> the new measures , here derived from ccsd , revealed rapid convergence with a basis set enabling use in reasonably large complexes ( e.g. benzene dimer ) , proved their utility in application to small single - reference closed - shell noncovalent complexes , and , they helped to understand the nature of biases in dimers of hcn and fd , benzene - containing complexes , and , atomization of n@xmath21 vs. si@xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> more work is required to assess their performance in larger number of small complexes , larger complexes , in combination with multi - reference theories ( e.g. , cas - scf , full ci or dmrg ) , and , in systems with stronger interactions or open shells .     </S>",
