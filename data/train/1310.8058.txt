    "generalized harish - chandra modules have now been actively studied for more than 10 years .",
    "a _ generalized harish - chandra module _ @xmath5 over a finite - dimensional reductive lie algebra @xmath1 is a @xmath6module @xmath5 for which there is a reductive in @xmath1 subalgebra @xmath2 such that as a @xmath3module , @xmath5 is the direct sum of finite - dimensional generalized @xmath3isotypic components . if @xmath5 is irreducible , @xmath2 acts necessarily semisimply on @xmath5 , and in what follows we restrict ourselves to the study of generalized harish - chandra modules on which @xmath2 acts semisimply ; see @xcite for an introduction to the topic .    in this paper",
    "we present a brief review of results obtained in the past 10 years in the framework of algebraic representation theory , more specifically in the framework of cohomological induction , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , generalized harish - chandra modules have been studied also with geometric methods , see for instance @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but the geometric point of view remains beyond the scope of the current review .",
    "in addition , we restrict ourselves to finite - dimensional lie algebras @xmath1 and do not review the paper @xcite , which deals with the case of locally finite lie algebras .",
    "we omit the proofs of most results which have already appeared .",
    "the cornerstone of the algebraic theory of generalized harish - chandra modules so far is our work @xcite . in this work",
    "we define the notion of simple generalized harish - chandra modules with generic minimal @xmath3type and provide a classification of such modules .",
    "the result extends in part the vogan - zuckerman classification of simple harish - chandra modules .",
    "it leaves open the questions of existence and classification of simple @xmath0modules of finite type whose minimal @xmath3types are not generic .",
    "while the classification of such modules presents the main open problem in the theory of generalized harish - chandra modules , in the note @xcite we establish the existence of simple @xmath0modules with arbitrary given minimal @xmath3type .    in the paper",
    "@xcite we establish another general result , namely the fact that each module in the fundamental series of generalized harish - chandra modules has finite length .",
    "we then consider in detail the case when @xmath7 . in this case",
    "the highest weights of @xmath3types are just non - negative integers @xmath8 and the genericity condition is the inequality @xmath9 , @xmath10 being a bound depending on the pair @xmath11 . in @xcite we improve the bound @xmath10 to an , in general , much lower bound @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , we show that in a number of low dimensional examples the bound @xmath12 is sharp in the sense that the our classification results do not hold for simple @xmath0 modules with minimal @xmath3type @xmath13 for @xmath8 lower than @xmath12 . in @xcite",
    "we also conjecture that the zuckerman functor establishes an equivalence of a certain subcategory of the thickening of category @xmath14 and a subcategory of the category of @xmath15modules .",
    "sections [ sect:2 ] and [ sect:3 ] of the present paper are devoted to a brief review of the above results .",
    "we also establish some new results in terms of the algebra @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 stands for centralizer in @xmath1 ) .",
    "a notable such result is corollary [ corr:6 ] which gives a sufficient condition on a simple @xmath0module @xmath5 for @xmath18 to be a maximal reductive subalgebra of @xmath1 which acts locally finitely on @xmath5 .",
    "the idea of bringing @xmath18 into the picture leads naturally to considering a preferred class of reductive subalgebras @xmath2 which we call eligible : they satisfy the condition @xmath19 where @xmath20 is cartan subalgebra of @xmath2 . in section [ sect:5 ]",
    "we study a natural generalization of harish - chandra s discrete series to the case of an eligible subalgebra @xmath2 .",
    "a key statement here is that under the assumption of eligibility of @xmath2 , the isotypic component of the minimal @xmath3type of a generalized discrete series module is an irreducible @xmath21module ( theorem [ th3 ] ) .",
