    "the evidence of a neutrino rest mass represents one of the most exciting discoveries in the field of particle physics .",
    "the discovery of the neutrinoless double beta decay ( 0@xmath4-dbd ) , however , will provide not only the ultimate answer about the nature ( dirac or majorana ) of the neutrino , but will also allow to increase the sensitivity on the neutrino mass down to a few mev . as pointed out very recently by the members of the aps multidivisional neutrino study @xcite , double beta decay searches will play a central role in the neutrino physics of the next decade .",
    "the use of the bolometric technique offers the unique possibility to investigate different dbd nuclei with a considerably higher energy resolution , as needed for future experiments . in the case of a scintillating bolometer , the double independent read - out ( heat and scintillation ) will allow , thanks to the different scintillation quenching factor ( qf ) between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the suppression of the background events due to degraded @xmath1-particles , the main source of background for bolometric 0@xmath4-dbd experiments @xcite .",
    "the experimental signature of the 0@xmath4-dbd is in principle very clear : a peak ( at the @xmath5 value ) in the two - electron summed energy spectrum . in spite of this characteristic imprint ,",
    "the rarity of the process makes the identification very difficult .",
    "such signals have to be disentangled from a background due to natural radioactive decay chains , cosmogenic - induced activity , and man - made radioactivity , which deposit energy in the same region as the dbd , but at a faster rate . consequently",
    ", the _ main task _ in 0@xmath4-dbd searches is the natural background suppression using the state - of - the - art ultra - low background techniques and , hopefully , identifying the signal .",
    "there are different sources of background for dbd experiments that can be classified in four main categories .",
    "environmental @xmath2 s represent the main source of background for most of the present dbd experiments and arise mainly from the natural contaminations in @xmath6u and @xmath7th .",
    "the common highest @xmath2 line is the 2615 kev line of @xmath3tl , with a total branching ratio ( br ) of 36 % in the @xmath7th decay chain . above this energy",
    "there are only _ extremely rare _ high energy @xmath2-rays from @xmath8bi ; the total br in the energy window from 2615 up to 3270 kev is 0.15 % in the @xmath6u decay chain .",
    "it is therefore clear that a detector based on an dbd - emitter with the @xmath5 value above the 2615 kev line of @xmath3tl represents the optimal starting point for a future experiment .",
    "the most interesting dbd nuclei are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "most interesting dbd emitters nuclei . in parenthesis",
    "the natural isotopic abundance.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      another important source of background is due to neutrons : low energy neutrons can induce ( n,@xmath2 ) reactions in materials close ( or internal ) to the detectors with @xmath2 energies up to 10 mev ; furthermore , high energy neutrons generated by @xmath9-induced spallation reactions can release several mev by direct interaction in the detectors .",
    "this contribution represents only 1%  10% of the total background for the _ present _ dbd experiments . unlike @xmath6u and @xmath7th trace contaminations , neutrons can be , at least in principle , suppressed with suitable use of shielding / veto s .",
    "this source of background plays a role for almost all detectors , but is crucial for _ fully active _",
    "detectors , as in the case of bolometers .",
    "@xmath10 arising from surface contaminations located in dead layers faced to ( or on ) the detectors can lose part of their energy in a few microns and reach the detectors with an energy corresponding to the @xmath5 value .",
    "it is not straightforward to deal with this problem due to the fact that , unlike bulk contamination ( that can be measured through hpge detectors ) , the sensitivity of standard diagnostic devices can hardly reach the needed sensitivity @xcite .",
    "these contaminations arise from the machining , cleaning , or passivation of the materials to be used close to the detectors , as well from radon implantation .",
    "this @xmath1-continuum represents the main source of background for the cuoricino dbd experiment @xcite , as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .    background spectrum of the cuoricino experiment .",
    "the @xmath1-continuum extends up to the 0@xmath4-dbd region , at 2528 kev.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      this source of background has to be considered very carefully for non - homogeneous ( or passive ) detectors , but under certain assumptions does not play a significant role for homogeneous detectors . in the case of homogeneous detectors ,",
    "in fact , dangerous @xmath11 events can be recognized through delayed @xmath1 coincidences .",
    "if we discard the contribution of @xmath12pa of the @xmath6u chain , that has @xmath11 events with q@xmath13=2195 kev , all the remaining high energy decays are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . as can be argued by the scheme ,",
    "the @xmath11 decays are preceded ( or followed ) by an @xmath1 emission .",
    "therefore , using delayed @xmath1 coincidences , @xmath11 decays , that can mimic the 2 electron signal , are discarded .",
    "this technique can be easily applied for the @xmath6u decay chain , while may have some problems ( large death time ) with the @xmath3tl decay . in this case",
    "the decay is preceded by the @xmath1 of @xmath14bi with a mean time given by t@xmath15=3.05 m , and it is therefore clear that this method holds only if the contaminations are not too large .",
    "high energy @xmath11 decays of the @xmath6u and @xmath7th chains that can mimic the 2 electron signal.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      this source of background can affect both the detector itself and the surrounding shielding materials .",
    "regarding the detectors , the production of long - lived radioactive nuclei depends crucially on the target material .",
    "probably the best known cosmogenic isotope is the @xmath16co .",
    "this nucleus is extremely dangerous both for internal ( detector ) and for external ( shielding ) contaminations .",
    "@xmath16co is , unfortunately , a common contaminant of copper , which represents the cleanest solid material available so far , often used for internal radioactive shielding by several dbd experiments . with respect to internal contamination ,",
    "the background spectrum is due to the @xmath17 ( q=318 kev ) + 2@xmath2 ( 1173 + 1332 kev ) , so that the released energy can reach the total q - value ( 2824 kev ) . regarding external contaminations , the background is mostly due only to the 2 @xmath2 s ( emitted in coincidence ) , with total energy of 2505 kev .",
    "therefore a future experiment based on a nucleus with @xmath18 2505 ( and possibly also @xmath192824 kev ) will avoid this problem .",
    "the first idea of using a scintillating bolometer was suggested for solar neutrino experiments in 1989 @xcite .",
    "the first light / heat measurement with @xmath1 background discrimination for dbd searches was performed with a thermal bolometer and silicon photodiode by our group in 1992 @xcite , but was no more pursued due to the difficulties of running such a light detector at low temperatures ( @xmath20 10 mk ) . the idea to use a bolometer as light detector was first developed by c. bobin et al .",
    "@xcite and then later optimized @xcite , for dark matter searches .",
    "starting from that work we developed a thermal light detector ( ld ) to be used for dbd search .",
    "a bolometer is , in principle , a very simple device .",
    "it is composed of an absorber coupled with a thermometer , so that an energy release in the absorber can be detected .",
    "the temperature rise in a thermal bolometer is given by @xmath21 , where e represents the energy released into the detector and c its heat capacity .",
    "this means that a very small detector can reach a very high sensitivity ( few tenths of ev ) ; therefore a `` dark '' thin bolometer can absorb scintillation photons and give a measurable thermal signal .",
    "i our case , the bolometer serves primally as a light detector and has the characteristic time constant of bolometers ( 20500 ms ) .",
    "however it is also sensitive to every energy release ( @xmath22 ) and acts as a particle detector .",
    "certainly large - surface bolometric ld s can not easily reach the threshold of pmt s ( @xmath23 1 photoelectron i.e. 37 photons , tacking into account the quantum efficiency conversion ) , but they have two important advantages : ( i ) they are sensitive over an extremely large band of photon wavelength ( depending on the absorber ) ; ( ii ) the overall quantum efficiency can be as good as that of photodiodes .",
    "this means that the energy resolution on the scintillating light , which depends ( above threshold ) only on the poisson statistical fluctuation of the emitted photons , will be better for bolometric ld s with respect to pmt s ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cdwo4 ] ) .",
    "the main characteristics of a bolometric light detector should be the _ easy _ expandability up to @xmath231000 channels , and the _ complete reliability _ of the composed device ( bolometer + ld ) in order to have an almost 100% live time measurement .",
    "on the other hand , there is not the need to have an extremely sensitive detector , since the dbd signal lies in the mev range .",
    "+ we developed our first ld as a pure ge disk absorber ( 35 mm diameter , 1 mm thick ) thermally coupled with an 3x1.5x0.4 mm@xmath24 neutron transmutation doped ge thermistor ( thermometer ) .",
    "we adopted a very simple setup in which the disk is held by two ptfe supports squeezed by a screw at two opposite sides . the complete setup ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) was tested in the cuore @xcite r&d cryostat located deep underground in the gran sasso national laboratories ( italy ) .",
    "the description of the front - end electronic can be found in @xcite .",
    "ld + scitillating crystals setup.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the ld was used to test several scintillating crystals ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : molibdates ] ) . after the encouraging results we decided to optimize the light detector .    at the working point of our bolometer , @xmath23 13",
    "mk , the theoretical heat capacity of the ge absorber is @xmath23 0.2 pj / k while that of the thermistor is @xmath23 32 pj / k .",
    "therefore the signal height is limited practically by the thermistor itself .",
    "we therefore decided to increase the size of the ge absorber .",
    "the idea was to develop a large - area light detector , able to read several _ large _ scintillating crystals at the same time , lowering the number of ld s needed to face a very large detector array .",
    "we used a 6.6 cm diameter , 1 mm thick ge crystal ( absorber ) coupled with the same kind of thermistor used for the previous ld .",
    "furthermore one side of the crystal ( the one facing the scintillator ) was coated with a layer of 60 nm of sio@xmath25 in order to increase the absorption of the scintillating photons .",
    "the new ld was mounted in the same way as the previous one .",
    "we tested the new large - area ld with a 3x3x2 cm@xmath24 , 140 g cdwo@xmath0 single crystal ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : cdwo4 ] ) .",
    "within the _ standard _ scintillators , an obvious possibility for dbd searches are the molybdates , due to the high @xmath5 of @xmath27mo ( 3034 kev ) .",
    "the scintillation properties of these crystals , based on the ( moo@xmath0)@xmath28 oxyanions , were studied only very recently @xcite , and further investigations are on the way .",
    "our first aim was to see the scintillation light yield ( ly ) of several different samples . at that time no direct measurements were available on the particle - induced ly at temperatures lower than 77 k. our ld was faced ( simultaneously ) to several small size ( few grams ) molybdate crystal bolometers ( pbmoo@xmath0 , camoo@xmath0 , srmoo@xmath0 ) and all of them exhibited scintillation light ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) . due to the small size of the molybdate crystals , their energy response , as a bolometer , becomes extremely non - linear at high values .",
    "this behaviour is common for small bolometers and can be corrected using calibration sources . in our case",
    "the only calibration source used was a pure @xmath6u solution evaporated on a small spot facing each crystal .",
    "the only `` clear '' peak is therefore the double @xmath1 line of @xmath6u at 4198 and 4151 kev . besides this @xmath1 decay",
    "there is the @xmath17 decay of @xmath12pa with an endpoint at 2.3 mev .",
    "the induced scintillation due to the @xmath17 + 2 @xmath2 decays of @xmath12th was below the threshold of the ld .",
    "the three scatter - plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] show some differences , particularly in the @xmath1 region .",
    "regarding the camoo@xmath0 sample the @xmath6u is clearly visible in the scatter plot . in the case of the pbmoo@xmath0 sample ,",
    "the scatter plot is dominated by an internal contamination of @xmath29pb , with the characteristic @xmath1 line of @xmath29po at 5407 kev .",
    "the situation is not completely clear in the srmoo@xmath0 sample : this crystal shows extremely large contaminations in the @xmath1-region and is very difficult to disentangle them due to the extreme non - linearity of the detector .",
    "furthermore , a clear bi - po event ( @xmath30 ) is present in the spectrum ( due to the slowness of the thermal detectors the two decays appear as one ) .",
    "even if not exactly quantifiable due to the non - linearity of the energy scale , the power of the @xmath1 discrimination technique is absolutely clear in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] thanks to the different scintillation qf .",
    "scatter plots of light vs heat obtained with the three crystals .",
    "all the crystals , due to their small size , saturate the heat channel at high energies .",
    "the heat energy scale is therefore not linearized and expressed in mv .",
    "the y axis represents the light output ( in mv ) of the ld . in this case",
    "the scale is linear and direct comparison between the three crystals is possible.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the second step could be to use larger crystals .",
    "once we have experimentally proven that the ly is sufficient to discriminate the @xmath1 s , we also have to show that we can build large size ( hundreds of grams ) bolometers with the needed high energy resolution .",
    "however other considerations need to be addressed first in order to have a good scintillating bolometer for a future high sensitivity dbd experiment .",
    "pbmoo@xmath0 has two disadvantages : it contains lead and therefore the radioactive @xmath29pb .",
    "the only way to avoid this problem would be to use ancient lead to grow the crystal .",
    "furthermore the mass fraction of molybdenum within the compound will be `` only '' 26 % .",
    "our sample of srmoo@xmath0 seems to be radioactively contaminated , so we can not fully judge this material . with some effort ,",
    "a radiopure crystal might be grown but the cosmogenic @xmath31sr , in spite of its low @xmath32 energy , could represent a problem , especially regarding pile - up .",
    "camoo@xmath0 could be a good candidate .",
    "it contains a large fraction of molybdenum , there are several producers able to grow large crystals , and it seems to be reasonably radiopure .",
    "unfortunately the backdraw is ca .",
    "the 2-neutrino dbd of @xmath33ca , with @xmath5=4271 kev ( although only 0.18 % of natural isotopic abundance ) will result in an unavoidable background in the 0@xmath4-dbd region of @xmath27mo . this background can be easily evaluated as 0.01 c / kev / kg / y .",
    "this bolometer was tested , together with 8 cuore bolometers , in a long background measurement during april 2005 .",
    "the 3x3x2 cm@xmath24 , 140 g cdwo@xmath0 single crystal was almost fully surrounded by a reflecting sheet oriented towards the ld that and glued , with a small spot , on the copper .",
    "it was not possible to calibrate the ld with the standard @xmath2-sources we usually place _ outside _ the cryostat , due to its small size ( it is almost transparent to @xmath2 s , while external x - rays would not reach the cryostat inner volume ) .",
    "nevertheless an estimation can be obtained by considering the resolution on the light signal .",
    "assuming that the resolution of the ld on the scintillation peaks is only due to the statistical fluctuation of the number of photons produced in the cdwo@xmath0 crystal , the ld can be calibrated .",
    "this assumption holds only if the intrinsic energy resolution of the detector is small with respect to the photon fluctuation .",
    "the intrinsic energy resolution of the ld can be evaluated by means of a heater that can inject monochromatic thermal energy  @xcite into the detector .",
    "we found in this way that the intrinsic energy resolution was negligible with respect to the width of the scintillation peaks .",
    "therefore , assuming a fano factor equal to 1 , and plotting the energy of the photopeaks vs the energy resolution , an energy calibration ( in photons ) can be found as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "the number of collected photons was measured to be @xmath23 2400 photons / mev . using this calibration , and assuming @xmath23 3 ev / photon the ld can be calibrated in energy . with this method we found that the energy resolution of the ld is @xmath34  48 ev fwhm ( or 16 photons ) .",
    "it turns out that the baseline resolution of the ld was observed to be 1 order of magnitude smaller compared to the intrinsic statistical photon fluctuation at 2615 kev , suggesting the possibility to further increase the area of the ld for our purposes .",
    "energy resolution of the light detector on the scintillation light emitted by the cdwo@xmath0 corresponding to the full energy peaks .",
    "the intrinsic energy resolution is evaluated thanks to the heater pulses.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the energy resolution on the scintillation peak at 2615 kev is 3% fwhm .",
    "this value is similar ( in some cases even better ) to those obtained with nai detectors .",
    "furthermore this result is much better ( 8% fwhm ) with respect to the one obtained with _ dedicated _ dbd experiments using cdwo@xmath0 as a scintillator ( at room temperature ) read by standard pmt s  @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison between the two set - ups is , however , not straightforward .",
    "first of all the size of the crystals is different ( 330 g in that case ) .",
    "furthermore there could be a ly increase in the cdwo@xmath0 with the temperature decrease , therefore justifying our better result .",
    "but probably the explanation of our better energy resolution is due to the quantum efficiency , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : ld ] : the pmt s matched for cdwo@xmath0 emission have a quantum efficiency of the order of only 18% .",
    "furthermore the best energy resolution ever achieved with pmt s on cdwo@xmath0 scintillators is 3.7 % fwhm ( at 2615 kev )  @xcite on an extremely small sample ( 1 cm@xmath24 ) .",
    "we also performed a long background run with the cdwo@xmath0-ld device .",
    "since the main aim of the run was to perform a low background measurement with 8 cuore detectors , the device was mounted `` far away '' from the teo@xmath25 detectors .",
    "because of the limited experimental volume in the cryostat , the device was mounted only partially shielded ( not shielded against the dilution units itself ) and not in the `` best '' position ( the cuore detectors are connected to a vibration decoupler that minimizes the mechanical vibrations that reach the detectors causing thermal noise ) . during the 417 h live time background measurement the energy resolution of the cdwo@xmath0 was 25 kev .",
    "the obtained scatter plot heat vs light of our detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] . a live time of 80% was achieved .",
    "scatter plot of heat vs light obtained in a 417 h live time background measurement .",
    "the points in the 0 - 300 kev ( heat ) region are due to pile - up .",
    "the @xmath1-induced background is clearly discriminated.,scaledwidth=67.0% ]    the @xmath1-continuum is completely ruled out thanks to the scintillation detection .",
    "moreover the background above the 2615 kev line is practically _ zero _ , demonstrating the power of this technique .",
    "only two counts are present , above the @xmath3tl line , around @xmath23 5 mev .",
    "one of these seems to be a pile - up ( it is just above an @xmath1 line ) , while the second could arise from the ( n,@xmath2 ) reaction on @xmath35cd ( @xmath36 20000 barn ) .",
    "our cryostat is not shielded against thermal neutrons and tacking into account the natural neutron flux in our laboratory , we expect @xmath23 0.8 @xmath2 counts in the energy window 2.6 - 9 mev .    the large number of events in the 0300 kev region is due to the natural @xmath17 decay of @xmath35cd ( 12.2 % i.a . ) with q@xmath37=318 kev and t@xmath15=7.7 10@xmath38 y. the expected activity can therefore be evaluated ( and directly measured ) and turns out to be 0.12 hz .    some pile - up is found in the scatter plot , especially clear in the 0 - 300 kev `` heat '' region .",
    "this was due to the fact that `` close '' to the ld ( and therefore close to the cdwo@xmath0 ) a relatively intense @xmath6u source was present in order to calibrate other bolometers mounted in the cryostat in this run . since the ld is a bolometer , it exhibits the same pulses whether it absorbs photons or particles . due to the slowness of the ld",
    "some pile - up appears in the scatter plot .",
    "this pile - up can be reduced with a combined trigger ( in our case the two detectors had independent triggers ) . in any case",
    "the problem can be avoided simply eliminating the @xmath6u source .    at the end of the background measurement we recognized a small failure in the electronic amplifier board of the cdwo@xmath0 .",
    "we fixed the problem and we performed a new energy calibration using a @xmath7th source . the obtained calibration spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : fig8 ] .",

    "however , this technique is also extremely helpful for rejecting another `` unavoidable '' source of background that can take place with thermal detectors .",
    "it was observed @xcite that rare heat releases induced by materials relaxations can induce thermal pulses indistinguishable with respect to particle - induced thermal pulses .",
    "it is presently not completely clear the energy scale of such events , but in any case a _ completely independent _ double read - out of the signal ( heat and scintillation ) will also allow one to identify such events due to the fact that they do not produce scintillation light .",
    "we developed a large area ( 34 @xmath39 ) thermal light detector for dbd searches .",
