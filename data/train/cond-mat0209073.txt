    "one of the long - standing problems that are still short of detailed understanding is to explain the magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy of magnetic materials containing transition - metal elements , especially that of fe , co , and ni .",
    "magnetic anisotropy is the dependency of internal energy on the direction of spontaneous magnetization . generally , the magnetic anisotropy energy term possesses the symmetry of the crystal .",
    "it is therefore called magneto - crystalline anisotropy or crystal magnetic anisotropy . in transition metals ,",
    "most of the magnetic moment comes from spin polarization . within the non - relativistic approach",
    ", there is no term coupling to the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the magnetic moment , therefore , can points to an arbitrary direction .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy energy is an relativistic phenomenon of spin - orbit coupling . with spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the spin degrees of freedom interact with the spatial anisotropy through the coupling to the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "this induces a preferred direction of spins .",
    "this happens even though the total angular momentum is completely quenched .",
    "since spin - orbit coupling couples individual spin degrees of freedom to individual orbital degrees of freedom , the fact that total orbital magnetic moment is quenched does not affect the visibility of spatial anisotropy to magnetic moment .",
    "the primary difficulty toward investigating mae has been attributed to the fact that the mae of the metals are as small as of the order of @xmath5atom . at low temperature ( @xmath6 )",
    ", mae is of the order of @xmath7atom for hcp co , @xmath8atom for fcc ni , and @xmath9atom for bcc fe . with advances in the accurate total energy method combined with the development of faster computers",
    ", attempts have been made to calculate mae from first - principles for bulk crystalline fe , co , and ni . while the magnitude of the mae have been predicted for all the three metals , the correct easy axis for ni has not been predicted so far .",
    "here we present new results that predict the correct easy axis for ni as well as reproduce the previous results in relevant limits .",
    "this result is obtained by incorporating spin  orbit coupling , non - collinear nature of of intra  atomic magnetization , and strong correlation effects .",
    "we also suggest why the previous approaches have failed in obtaining the correct easy axis for ni .    experimentally , there are various ways of measuring the magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "these range from torque measurements , saturation magnetic fields and ferromagnetic resonance methods .",
    "however , torque measurements are more often used and are considered to be reasonably precise .",
    "the main principle behind the torque experiments is that in the presence of an external magnetic field misaligned with respect to the easy axis ( or equivalently , direction of the crystal magnetization ) , the magnetic moment experiences a torque . in equilibrium",
    ", this torque is balanced by the crystal anisotropy torque .",
    "torque magneto ",
    "meters are used to precisely measure this torque . since the crystal anisotropy torque is just the angular derivative of the magnetic anisotropy energy , a measurement of the torque gives an indirect estimate of the anisotropy energy .",
    "the torque measured at various angles are interpolated to a corresponding analytic expression such as angular derivatives of total energy .",
    "the analytic expression of total energy can be expressed in terms of parameters based on crystal symmetry .",
    "the simplest form of crystal magnetic anisotropy is uniaxial anisotropy , for example , in hexagonal cobalt with easy direction parallel to the @xmath10 axis of the crystal at room temperature . as the internal magnetization rotates away from the @xmath10 axis , the anisotropy energy increases with increase of @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the angle between the @xmath10 axis and the internal magnetization .",
    "we can expand this energy in a series of powers of @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants .    for cubic crystals such as iron and nickel ,",
    "the anisotropy energy can be expressed in terms of the directional cosines @xmath16 of the internal magnetization with respect to the three cubic edges .",
    "because of the high symmetry of the cubic crystal , the anisotropy energy can be expressed in a fairly simple way : @xmath17 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants .",
    "the constants @xmath18 obtained by interpolating the torque are substituted back to get the expression for the total energy .",
    "magnetic anisotropy energy is calculated by subtracting energies at two different direction of magnetic moments , e.g. [ 001 ] and [ 111 ]    to measure the torque , specimens are formed into short cylinders .",
    "the specimens are mounted in a carriage held by two torsion fibers that are fastened to a rigid support at the top and to a circular scale s at the bottom .",
    "when the field is excited in the electromagnet , the crystal tends to turn so that the direction of easy magnetization is parallel to the field .",
    "the torque so produced is balanced by turning the bottom of the lower fiber until the crystal regains its original orientation as determined by reflection of a light beam from the mirror .",
    "the scale reading @xmath19 is then compared with the original reading @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is a measure of the torque .",
    "the orientation of the crystal axes with respect to the applied field is varied by turning the electromagnet , which is mounted on a heavy bearing , and noting its position on a suitable scale , @xmath23 .",
    "one then plots the torque against the crystal orientation and deduces from the curve the crystal anisotropy constant @xmath18 .",
    "early attempts to explain magnetic anisotropy are based on the interaction between the magnetization and the lattice through spin - orbit coupling combined with band theory  @xcite .",
    "later , brooks  @xcite used an itinerant electron model and orbital angular momentum quenching in cubic crystals to explain mae . treating the spin - orbit coupling as a perturbation , the nontrivial magnetic anisotropy came out at the fourth - order .",
    "the correct directions of magnetization were obtained for fe and ni .",
    "the difference between easy axes in these metals was attributed to the different lattice structures of them .",
    "based on ni - fe alloy data , however , a much closer correlation between the anisotropy and the number of valence electrons was observed .",
    "what is the factor that determines the easy axis has been another unanswered question since then . in subsequent papers  @xcite the calculations became more and more refined .",
    "finally the discussion centered around the importance of degenerate states along symmetry lines in the brillouine zone and plausible explanations of the origin of magnetic anisotropy were provided  @xcite .",
    "contemporary studies of magnetic anisotropy energy have centered on first - principles calculations , using density functional theory  @xcite within the framework of local spin density approximation ( lsda )  @xcite .",
    "eckardt , fritsche , and noffke  @xcite were able to get the values of the right order of magnitude for fe and ni , but with incorrect easy axis for fe .",
    "daalderop , kelly , and schuurmans  @xcite used the force theorem  @xcite to obtain the correct order of magnitude of the mae for fe , co , and ni , but incorrect easy axes were found for co , and ni . they also observed that changing the number of valence electrons , hence removing the lda artificial @xmath24 pocket would restore the correct easy axis .",
    "this observation is similar to brooks observation of the close correlation bewteen the direction of magnetic moment and the number of valence electrons .",
    "wang , wu , and freeman developed state tracking method to study magnetic anisotropy of fe  @xcite .",
    "trygg , johansson , eriksson , and willis  @xcite improved the method while using fully self - consistent approach .",
    "orbital polarization was also incorporated , which was suggested by jansen  @xcite .",
    "while the correct easy axis was obtained for co and fe , in case of ni the calculation still gave the wrong easy axis .",
    "this is the best result before the current work .",
    "schneider , erickson , and jansen  @xcite used torque instead of energy difference to obtain the same result as that of trygg , johansson , eriksson , and willis .",
    "they also treated the spin - orbit coupling constant as an adjustable parameter .",
    "they succeeded in restoring the correct easy axis for ni with an unphysically large value of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this work suggested a close relation between magnetic anisotropy energy and the strength of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "halilov , perlov , oppeneer , yaresko , and antonov also scaled spin - orbit coupling in order to enlarge its effect on the mae and confirmed previous results  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the physics of transition metal compounds is intermediate between atomic limit where the localized @xmath25 electrons are treated in the real space and fully itinerant limit when the electrons are described by band theory in k space .",
    "a many  body method incorporating these two important limits is the dynamical mean  field theory ( dmft )  @xcite .",
    "the dmft approach has been extensively used to study model hamiltonian of correlated electron systems in the weak , strong and intermediate coupling regimes .",
    "it has been very successful in describing the physics of realistic systems , like the transition metal oxides and , therefore , is expected to treat properly the materials with @xmath25 or @xmath26 electrons .",
    "we take a new view that the correlation effects within the @xmath25 shell are important for the magnetic anisotropy of @xmath27 transition metals like ni .",
    "these effects are not captured by the lda but are described by hubbard  like interactions presented in these systems and need to be treated by an extension of first principles methods such as dmft . since",
    ", dmft reduces to lda@xmath28u  @xcite in static limit , we adopt lda@xmath28u method to attack the problem of magnetic anisotropy of @xmath27 transition metals .",
    "another effect which has not been investigated in the context of magnetic anisotropy calculations is the non - collinear nature of intra - atomic magnetization  @xcite .",
    "it is expected to be important when spin - orbit coupling and correlation effects come into play together .",
    "we show that when we include these new ingredients into the calculation we solve the long - standing problem of predicting the correct easy axis of ni .",
    "part of this work has been published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ ldaudmftsec ] presents dmft extended to relativistic electron structure problem , its equivalence to lda+u in static limit .",
    "section  [ maesec ] describes calculated mae .",
    "section  [ bandsec ] discusses the calculated mae in conjunction with band structure .",
    "section [ soosec ] presents how to include other relativistic corrections than spin ",
    "orbit coupling and discuss the effects of spin  other  orbit coupling .",
    "section [ concsec ] is a summary and conclusion .",
    "the lda method is very successful in many materials for which the one  electron model of solids works . however , in correlated electron system this is not always the case . in strongly correlated situations ,",
    "the total energy is not very sensitive to the potential since the electrons are localized due to the interactions themselves , and the lack of sensitivity of the functional to the density , does not permit to devise good approximations to the exact functional in this regime .",
    "for example , when the mott transition takes place the invertibility condition is not satisfied .",
    "our view is that these difficulties can not be remedied by using more complicated exchange and correlation functionals in density functional theory .",
    "dmft is a method successfully describing strongly correlated systems  @xcite and has been extended to electronic structure problems  @xcite . in this work",
    "we utilize the new functional formulation of the electronic structure problem and extend it to relativistic case .",
    "the basic idea is to introduce another relevant variable in addition to the density @xmath29 and the magnetic moment density @xmath30 , namely the local green function .",
    "the latter is defined by projecting the full green function onto a separate subset of correlated `` heavy '' orbitals distinguished by the orbital index @xmath31 and the spin index @xmath32 from a complete set of orbitals @xmath33 of a tight - binding representation which we assume for simplicity to be orthogonal .",
    "the local green function is therefore given by a matrix @xmath34 with elements @xcite @xmath35 we then construct a functional @xmath36 $ ] which gives the exact free energy at a stationary point .    to describe the new method , we consider fermion system under an external potential @xmath37 and an external magnetic field @xmath38 . for relativistic effects spin - orbit coupling , whose effects are important for magnetic anisotropy calculations , are also considered .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is included according to the suggestion by andersen  @xcite .",
