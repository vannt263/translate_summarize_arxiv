    "we consider the integrable system of two coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlses ) , namely the manakov system , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are wave envelopes , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are space and time variables respectively , @xmath5 is a real constant and subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to the corresponding variables .",
    "eq.([cnls01 ] ) represents the propagation of an optical pulse in a birefringent optical fibre and in wavelength division multiplexed system @xcite .",
    "it has been studied widely in the literature .",
    "the complete integrability of this system of coupled nlses was first established by manakov @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that this two - component vector generalization of the focusing nls equation admits several interesting properties including ( i ) infinite number of conservation laws @xcite , ( ii ) lax pair @xcite , ( iii ) an infinite - dimensional algebra of non - commutative symmetries @xcite , ( iv ) bilinear representation and bright multi - soliton solutions @xcite and so on .",
    "eq.([cnls01 ] ) also appears in multi - component bose - einstein condensates @xcite , bio - physics @xcite , finance @xcite and oceanographic studies @xcite .",
    "solitons in coupled nlses have been the subject of intense study over the past few years because of their interesting collision properties and their robustness against external perturbations .",
    "the explicit multi - bright and dark soliton solutions of ( [ cnls01 ] ) were obtained by radhakrishnan et al.@xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the soliton solutions of ( [ cnls01 ] ) exhibit a fascinating shape changing collision , resulting in a redistribution of intensity between the modes of the two solitons , which is not observed in the scalar nlse case @xcite .",
    "very recently , a new rational solution called rogue wave ( rw ) solution has attracted considerable attention .",
    "rws , alternatively called freak or giant waves , were first observed in arbitrary depth of ocean circumstances .",
    "a wave is classified into this category when its wave height ( distance from trough to crest ) reaches a value which is atleast twice that of the significant wave height @xcite .",
    "these waves may arise from the instability of a certain class of initial conditions that tend to grow exponentially and thus have the possibility of increasing up to very high amplitudes , due to modulation instability @xcite . over the years rws",
    "have also been observed in models that arise in the description of multi - component bose - einstein condensates @xcite , capillary waves @xcite , multi - component plasmas @xcite and even in finance @xcite .",
    "recently efforts have been made to explain the rw excitation through a nonlinear process .",
    "it has been found that the nls equation can describe many dynamical features of the rw .",
    "certain kinds of exact solutions of nls equation have been considered to describe possible mechanism for the formation of rws such as peregrine soliton , time periodic breather or ma soliton ( ms ) and space periodic breather or akhmediev breather ( ab ) . as",
    "a consequence attempts have been made to construct rw solution through different methods for the nls equation and its higher derivative generalizations .",
    "one way of obtaining rw solution or peregrine soliton for a given system is to first construct a breather solution , either ab or ms . from the latter , the rw solution can be deduced in an appropriate limit .",
    "as far as the system of two coupled nlses is concerned , in recent years , the following studies have been undertaken .",
    "breathers and rational breather solutions of multi - component nlse are presented in @xcite in a determinantal form as limiting cases in suitable degenerations of algebro - geometric solutions .",
    "explicit first , second and third order rw solutions of ( [ cnls01 ] ) have been constructed in ref.@xcite through the modified darboux transformation method .",
    "the authors have also studied some basic properties of multi - rogue wave solutions and their collision structures . in ref.@xcite two types of rw solutions through darboux transformation method have been derived .",
    "the authors have shown that while the first kind of rw solution is similar to the first - order rw solution of nlse , the second kind of rw behaves differently from that of the first order rogue wave solution .",
    "recently , an in - depth analysis on the construction of vector peregrine soliton solution and bright - dark - rw solution of eq.([cnls01 ] ) has been made in ref.@xcite .",
    "in all the above cited works only the explicit forms of rws are given and we do not see any simple tractable form of breather solutions .    since the breather solution plays an important role in the formation of rws we aim here to derive the breather solution for the widely studied nonlinear evolution equation ( [ cnls01 ] ) .",
    "we divide our analysis into two parts . in the first part ,",
    "we construct a periodic envelope two soliton solution through hirota s bilinearization method . by appropriately restricting the wave number ( of one of the solitons to be the complex conjugate of the other ) which appears in the two soliton solution we obtain the gb form of ( [ cnls01 ] ) . from the gb solution we derive ab , ms and rw solutions .",
    "we note here that through a restricted set of transformations , the gb solution of the manakov equation can be obtained from the gb solution of the nls equation with a modified nonlinear parameter . in other words",
    "one can generate the above rational solutions of the manakov system from the standard nonlinear schrdinger equation with a modified nonlinear parameter .",
    "in the second part of our work we analyze the reverse problem : how can one construct a ab or ms or gb from a rw solution ?",
    "we answer this question by rewriting the rw solution in a factorized form and then generalizing this factorized form in an imbricate series expression with certain unknown parameters in this series , following the earlier work of tajiri and watanabe @xcite for the case of scalar nls equation and finally finding these unknown parameters in the imbricate series by substituting it in eq .",
    "( [ cnls01 ] ) and solving the resultant equations . with three different forms of the imbricate series we derive the ab , ms and gb solutions from the rw solution of ( [ cnls01 ] ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is follows . in the following sec .",
    "[ gb ] we construct the explicit form of the gb solution of the two coupled nlse system ( [ cnls01 ] ) through hirota s bilinearization method .",
    "we then explain the method of deriving ab , ms and rw solutions from the gb solution .",
    "the obtained form of rw solution coincides with the ones in the literature . in sec .",
    "[ rwtoab ] , we discuss the method of constructing the ab solution from the rw solution . in sec .",
    "[ rwtoms ] , we demonstrate the construction of ms from rw . in sec .",
    "[ rwtogb ] , we formulate the imbricate series form for the rws with certain unknown arbitrary functions in it and then compare this expression with the one derived from the gb in the same way . the comparison provides exact expressions for the unknown arbitrary functions which appear in the imbricate series of the rw . in this way",
    "we establish a method of constructing gbs from rw . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we seek a periodic envelope solution to the cnls equations ( [ cnls01 ] ) with the boundary conditions @xmath6 , i=1,2 , as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real constants .",
    "to start with we bilinearize eq.([cnls01 ] ) through the transformation @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are complex functions and @xmath14 is a real function .",
    "the resultant bilinearized forms read @xmath15    in the above , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are hirota s bilinear operators @xcite .",
    "once the nonlinear evolutionary equation has been bilinearized , with truncated parameter expansion at different levels , a series of solutions , in particular the n - soliton solution , can be obtained .",
    "as far as eqs.([pct2 ] ) are concerned , the n - soliton solution , can be obtained with respect to the expansion parameter @xmath18 , that is @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 s and @xmath23 s , @xmath24 , are complex functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath25 s are real variables .    as our aim is to obtain the two soliton solution we terminate the expansion at quadratic powers in @xmath18 , that is @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the resultant two soliton solution emerges in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 in the above @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , are complex parameters and @xmath36 in the above we have chosen @xmath37 .",
    "one can proceed by assuming @xmath38 also .",
    "however , in order to obtain the required breather solutions we find that one has to essentially fix @xmath37 .",
    "we have not pursued the possibility of a more general bilinearization than eq .",
    "( [ pct2 ] ) which will lead to the possibility @xmath38 in ( [ pct3 ] ) .",
    "we hope to consider such a generalization in future .",
    "so in our analysis we have made this choice in the beginning itself .",
    "note that due to the choice @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ pct3 ] ) one can effectively make a transformation @xmath39 so that @xmath40 satisfies the scalar nls equation with the nonlinearity parameter @xmath41 : @xmath42 consequently one can write down the breather solution of the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 equivalently from the breather solution of the above scalar nls equation as well .    the constants , @xmath43 , @xmath44 help us to split the above breather expression into akhmediev and ma breathers as we see below . to obtain the breather solution from the above two soliton solution we take @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "substituting these two restrictions in ( [ pct3 ] ) and considering @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the exponential functions appearing in ( [ pct3 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions .",
    "the resultant expression for @xmath49 turns out to be @xmath50 , \\label{pct5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constants .",
    "the exact forms of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given below : @xmath62 consequently the solution of the manakov equation ( [ cnls01 ] ) can be obtained from ( [ pc4 ] ) as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "expression ( [ pct5 ] ) combined with ( [ pc4 ] ) constitutes the gb solution of the cnls equations ( [ cnls01 ] ) .",
    "1 illustrates the behavior of this breather solution , which is periodic both in space and in time . from the gb solution we can derive ab , ms and rw solutions by restricting the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 suitably . in the following ,",
    "we report the explicit forms of these solutions .      to derive the ab solution",
    ", we consider the choice @xmath67 and @xmath68 in ( [ pct5 ] ) .",
    "this restriction fixes the wave number to be pure imaginary . in this case",
    "we find @xmath69 substituting the gb solution ( [ pct5 ] ) in ( [ pc4 ] ) , the latter provides @xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath52 .",
    "we have plotted the solution ( [ pct7 ] ) in fig .",
    "the solution is periodic in @xmath3 and localized in @xmath4 .",
    "this spatially periodic breather is nothing but the ab solution .",
    "now we consider the other case , @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 in the gb solution ( ( [ pc4 ] ) with ( [ pct5 ] ) ) .",
    "this restriction fixes the imaginary part of the wave number to be zero .",
    "this in turn provides another form of the breather solution which will propagate only in the time direction , that is @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 we depict this solution in fig .",
    "the plot confirms that the solution is periodic in @xmath4 and localized in @xmath3 .",
    "the wave solution which is temporally breathing and spatially oscillating is called a ma breather / ms .      to construct the rw solution from the gb expression we consider both @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be non - zero and evaluate the latter in the limit @xmath78 by implementing a taylor expansion .",
    "doing so we find @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a small parameter , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants . substituting these two expressions in ( [ pct4 ] ) with the restriction @xmath84 , @xmath85 and making the taylor expansion at @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath86 it is also straightforward to check that @xmath87 and @xmath88 substituting the above expressions , ( [ pct10 ] ) , in the general breather form ( [ pct5 ] ) and taking the limit @xmath78 in the resultant expression , we arrive at @xmath89 where @xmath90 which is nothing but the rw solution of cnls system which is localized both in space and time .",
    "the rw solution of the cnls equation matches with the one presented in @xcite .",
    "we note that the restriction @xmath91 in ( [ pct8 ] ) provides the rw solution of the scalar nls equation . a typical evolution of the rw is shown in fig .",

    "corresponding contour plot .",

    "( b ) corresponding contour plot .",
    "similar profile occurs for @xmath2 also ( not shown here ) . ]    in the above , we derived ab , mb and rw solutions from the gb solution . on the other hand",
    "we now point out the interesting possibility that one can also construct the above solutions from the rw solution itself in a reverse way . in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate this by following the procedure of tajiri and watanabe for the case of the scalar nls equation @xcite .",
    "to do so we consider the rw solutions in an imbricate series form .",
    "to derive ab from rw solution we first factorize the rw solution ( [ pct11 ] ) in the following form , namely @xmath109 @xmath110 we note here that one of the remarkable properties displayed by many classical nonlinear evolution equations possessing soliton modes is a nonlinear superposition principle .",
    "more precisely , an infinite array of solitons placed at equal intervals constitutes an exact periodic solution of the evolution equations .",
    "for example , if we take the algebraic soliton solution of the modified korteweg - de vries equation in the form @xmath111 , we can write a more general solution through a superposition of these algebraic solitons as @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the spacing between successive peaks of the sequence of solitary pulses and @xmath114 is the phase speed of the pattern , which is to be determined . by rewriting the algebraic soliton solution as a hyperbolic cot function and further splitting the latter as sinh and cosh functions",
    ", one can get an expression for the periodic solution with an unknown parameter @xmath114 .",
    "this parameter can be derived by substituting the hyperbolic cot function form in the original evolutionary equation ( for more details one may refer to @xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "the above is indeed an imbricate solution .",
    "in fact a theorem on imbricate series ( see for example , theorem 3.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) asserts that any periodic function @xmath115 with period @xmath116 has two series representations .",
    "if the usual fourier series is @xmath117 then the alternative expansion is the imbricate series @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the fourier transform of @xmath120 , that is , @xmath121    however , the imbricate series of rogue waves which we consider in the following will be different from the usual way of applying such a series which is the superposition of the solitary waves .",
    "the important point here is that the breather solution ( [ pct12 ] ) is being constructed by the product of two imbricate series of rogue wave as shown below . for mathematical simplicity",
    "we consider the constant @xmath74 hereafter ( for @xmath122 , see below ) .",
    "we consider eq .",
    "( [ pct12 ] ) in a more general form , that is @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a constant , @xmath126 , @xmath57 and @xmath127 are all to be determined .",
    "however , to derive the ab solution we consider only this series . in the above expression we have grouped the spatial variable @xmath3 with the real part and the time variable @xmath4 with the imaginary part .",
    "we have superposed the rw solutions in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "using the trigonometric identity @xcite @xmath128 , we replace the infinite series by cot function and rewrite ( [ pct13 ] ) in a more compact form as @xmath129    our task is to plug the expression ( [ pct14 ] ) in ( [ cnls01 ] ) and determine the parameters @xmath126 , @xmath57 and the function @xmath127 consistently .",
    "to do so , in the first step , we replace the @xmath130 functions in ( [ pct14 ] ) as @xmath131 and substitute it in ( [ cnls01 ] ) and rewrite the equations in terms of @xmath132 and @xmath133 and their powers and products .",
    "we then simplify these equations using suitable trigonometric identities and rearrange the resultant expressions in the variables @xmath134 and their powers . by doing",
    "so we have arranged the spatial variable to appear only in the coefficients in the resultant equation .",
    "the final expressions for both the equations in ( [ cnls01 ] ) turn out to be one and the same . as a result we proceed to determine the unknowns @xmath57 , @xmath5 and @xmath127 from the single equation @xmath135 where @xmath136    to solve eq .",
    "( [ pct15 ] ) we equate the coefficients of various powers of @xmath137 to zero .",
    "this action yields a set of equations @xmath138 , @xmath139 involving the unknowns @xmath57 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we notice that the coefficient of sixth power of @xmath140 gives @xmath141 @xmath142 from which we can obtain the value of @xmath57 , that is @xmath143    the coefficient of @xmath144 also provides the same expression for @xmath57 as given in eq.([pct18 ] ) . equating next the coefficients of @xmath145 and @xmath134 to zero ,",
    "we get @xmath146 and @xmath147 here we get two equations which contain the first and second derivatives of the unknown function @xmath127 , namely @xmath148 and @xmath149 . solving these two equations algebraically , we find @xmath150 from eqs.([pct21 ] ) and ( [ pct22 ] ) we determine @xmath126 and @xmath127 as follows . differentiating eq.([pct21 ] ) with respect to @xmath3 and then replacing the first and second derivatives of @xmath127 which appear in this equation by ( [ pct21 ] ) and ( [ pct22 ] ) respectively and simplifying the resultant equation we find @xmath151    to obtain @xmath127 we integrate eq.([pct21 ] ) with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "this action leads us to @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a constant of integration .",
    "it is straight forward to check that @xmath127 satisfies both the eqs .",
    "( [ pct21 ] ) and ( [ pct22 ] ) with @xmath126 given by ( [ pct23 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "considering the coefficients of @xmath154 and @xmath155 and repeating the procedure outlined above we arrive at the same expressions for @xmath126 and @xmath127 which are given in ( [ pct23 ] ) and ( [ pct24 ] ) respectively .",
    "finally , equating the coefficient of constant term to zero , @xmath156 , we find that the resultant equation vanishes identically , with the expressions @xmath127 , @xmath126 and @xmath57 given above . as a result",
    "we have obtained a compatible set of solutions for @xmath126 , @xmath57 and @xmath127 which satisfies all the equations given in ( [ pct16 ] ) . now substituting the expressions of @xmath57 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the general form ( [ pct14 ] ) and after suitable rewriting",
    ", we obtain the ab solution in the form @xmath157    we can note that this solution is periodic in the spatial direction and it grows exponentially fast in the initial stage from the time oscillatory background . after reaching the maximum amplitude at a specific time , it decays exponentially again to the time oscillatory background .",
    "these two stages can be called as growing and decaying mode solutions , respectively , as has been done by tajiri and watanabe for the case of the scalar nls equation @xcite . a typical ab solution for a suitable set of parametric values",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we also note here that the akhmediev breather solution with @xmath158 can also be constructed by the following imbricate series , namely @xmath159 @xmath160 where @xmath161 . substituting this expression into ( [ cnls01 ] ) and repeating the procedure outlined above one",
    "can obtain the akhmediev breather with @xmath158 .",
    "next we construct the ms solution from the rw solution . to do so we again rewrite the rw solution in ( [ pct8 ] ) in a slightly different factorized form @xmath162 @xmath163 we can write this equation in the following general form with @xmath74 , @xmath164 @xmath165 where the function @xmath166 and the parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168 are to be determined . here",
    "we have superposed the rw in the temporal direction .",
    "we have also grouped the temporal variable with the real part and the spatial variable with the imaginary part .",
    "we identify the infinite series with the @xmath130 hyperbolic function @xcite , @xmath169 , and rewrite the above expression as @xmath170    as we did previously , we split the @xmath130 hyperbolic function as @xmath171 .",
    "we then substitute the expression ( [ pct27 ] ) into the cnls equations ( [ cnls01 ] ) and rewrite the latter in terms of @xmath171 . as before , we simplify this equation further by imposing trigonometric identities and arrive at an equation which is in powers of @xmath172 @xmath173 and their products . in this case",
    "also we find that both the equations in ( [ cnls01 ] ) provide the same expression . as a result",
    "we consider only the following equation to determine the unknown parameters , that is @xmath174 where @xmath175    equating the various powers of @xmath176 to zero , we obtain @xmath177 , @xmath178 .",

    "the coefficient of @xmath179 gives @xmath180 from which we fix @xmath181 we also obtain the same expression for @xmath168 by equating the coefficient of @xmath182 to zero . we proceed to consider the coefficients of @xmath183 and @xmath176 , namely @xmath184 and @xmath185 we consider these two expressions to determine the unknown @xmath166 .",
    "solving these two equations algebraically , we find @xmath186 we solve these two equations in the same manner as we did previously .",
    "our result shows that @xmath187 and @xmath188 where @xmath189 is a constant .",
    "we can also obtain the same expression for @xmath166 and @xmath167 from the coefficients of @xmath190 and @xmath191 by solving the resultant equations algebraically in the same manner .    inserting the obtained expressions of @xmath168 , @xmath192 and @xmath167 in the final determining equation we find that it vanishes trivially . with these expressions , the general form of ( [ pct26 ] ) now becomes @xmath193 which is nothing but the ma breather solution .",
    "this solution is periodic in the temporal direction and localized in space .",
    "it grows and decays recurrently in time oscillate background as in the case of nls equation @xcite .",
    "the ma breather solution of cnls equations for a set of parametric values is shown in fig .",
    "the rw solution can also be obtained as the limiting case of ma breathers .",
    "this can be done by imposing the limit @xmath194 and incorporating the taylor series expansion .",
    "we note here that the ma breather solution with @xmath158 can also be constructed by the following imbricate series , @xmath195 @xmath196 where @xmath161 .",
    "substituting this expression into ( [ cnls01 ] ) , and repeating the procedure given above , one can obtain the ma soliton with @xmath158 .",
    "it is very difficult to derive the gb solution from the rw solution in the same fashion as we did in the previous two cases .",
    "this is mainly because in the present analysis we have to include two arbitrary functions ( both of which are functions of @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) , one with real part and another with imaginary part in the imbricate series .",
    "the determining equations which come out from the imbricate series are difficult to solve unlike the earlier two cases . to overcome this difficulty we adopt the following methodology .",
    "we show that the absolute square of the modulus of rw solution of ( [ cnls01 ] ) can be written in terms of the second derivative of a logarithmic function which involves product of two imbricate series ( see eq.([pct38 ] ) given below ) .",
    "we then rewrite this expression in a more compact form which involves trigonometric functions which also contain these two arbitrary functions . unlike the earlier two cases we do not substitute this series into ( [ cnls01 ] ) and",
    "determine these two unknown arbitrary functions ( as it is very difficult to solve the determining equation ) .",
    "instead , we also rewrite the absolute square of the modulus of the general breather solution as the second derivative of a logarithmic function which contains product of two functions ( see eq .",
    "( [ pct42 ] ) given below ) . at this stage since both the gb expression and the rw solution have been written in the same form .",
    "we compare the arguments inside the logarithmic function and fix the exact expression of the two unknown arbitrary functions .",
    "this in turn confirms that the gb can also be derived from the rws . in the following ,",
    "we present the exact mathematical details of this procedure .    to begin with we rewrite the rw solution ( [ pct11 ] ) in the form @xmath197 is the same expression given in eq .",
    "( [ pct11 ] ) and the star denotes complex conjugate of it .",
    "the above expressions can be rewritten as the second derivative of a logarithimic function , namely @xmath198    now we consider eq .",
    "( [ pct37 ] ) in a more general form as @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are arbitrary functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 which need to be determined . in the above expression we considered the superposition of rws in both space and time directions . using the trigonometric identity @xcite @xmath202 , the above expression can be rewritten in the form , @xmath203 = @xmath204 . as a result eq .",
    "( [ pct39 ] ) can be brought to the form @xmath205 ) and determine the form of @xmath206 and @xmath207 . instead of this",
    "we compare the expression ( [ pct40 ] ) with the gb which is rewritten in the same form . for this purpose ,",
    "we rewrite the gb solution ( [ pc4 ] ) with ( [ pct5 ] ) in the form , @xmath208 , @xmath51 and @xmath209 . to compare this with the one derived from the rw solution we rewrite @xmath14 as @xmath210 with the @xmath211 and @xmath212 as given above .",

    "the solution is periodic in both space and time .",
    "during the past five years or so rogue wave solutions have been studied intensively in different physical contexts and several applications have been proposed . rogue waves in an array of optical wave - guides is one of the examples @xcite .",
    "optical rogue wave has already been suggested for application in enhancing supercontinuum generation and several authors have elucidated key aspects of the underlying nonlinear dynamical processes @xcite . in this work , we have constructed a class of nonlinear waves , namely gb , ab , ms and rw for the well known two coupled nlses ( [ cnls01 ] ) . to derive these solutions we followed two different paths . by following the conventional procedure we first brought out the explicit form of a gb solution from which we derived the other forms of rational solutions , namely ab , ms and rw solutions .",
    "we then deviated from this conventional approach and derived ab , ms and gb from the rw solution as the starting point .",
    "the expressions obtained in both the directions match with each other .",
    "our study on the coupled nlses will be useful in the study of rogue waves in birefringent optical fibers , multi - component bose - einstein condensates , multi - component plasmas and so on .",
    "we also hope to derive higher order breather solutions in both the directions discussed in this paper by extending the procedure .",

    "<S> the second approach has not been illustrated so far for the two component nls equation . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the above rational solutions of the manakov system can be derived from the standard scalar nonlinear schrdinger equation with a modified nonlinearity parameter . through this two way approach </S>",
