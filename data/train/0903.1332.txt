    "in many biological and industrial processes , diffusing particles are non - spherical and move in confined geometries",
    ". examples of particles in this scenario include proteins diffusing in membranes @xcite and very fine grains migrating through pores in porous media . to date ,",
    "quantitative measurements of anisotropic particle diffusion in confined geometries have been limited .",
    "however , new particle fabrication and imaging technologies combined with new image analysis tools now make the direct measurement of the diffusion of anisotropic particles readily possible .",
    "thus , in this contribution we investigate the anisotropic diffusion of isolated ellipsoidal particles confined between two parallel plates .",
    "the brownian diffusion coefficient @xmath3 of an isolated spherical particle is well understood .",
    "it is inversely proportional to the drag ( or friction ) coefficient @xmath4 via the einstein relation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 is the temperature . for a prolate spheroid with long axis of length @xmath8 and two short axes of length @xmath9 , translational diffusion is anisotropic and",
    "is described by diffusion coefficients @xmath10 along the long axis , and @xmath11 along the short axes .",
    "the rotational diffusion coefficient of the prolate spheroid about its short axes is @xmath12 .",
    "generally , the drag coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 depend on the shape and size of the ellipsoid .",
    "brownian motion of anisotropic particles was first seriously considered by f. perrin @xcite who computed these drag coefficients analytically for a spheroid diffusing in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "interestingly , the ratio @xmath2 varies from one to two in 3d , as the spheroid aspect ratio @xmath16 varies from one to infinity .",
    "the problem of diffusion in confined geometries , such as quasi-2d media , is different from the 3d case as a result of a complex interplay between hydrodynamic drag , the boundaries of the medium , and the particle geometry .",
    "surfaces near a moving particle modify fluid flow fields , often increasing particle hydrodynamic drag . a full theoretical formulation of wall hydrodynamic effects has been developed for one sphere ( or ellipsoid ) coupled to one wall @xcite .",
    "however , for more complicated situations , such as a sphere or an ellipsoid confined by two parallel walls , the only available analytical solutions are for weak confinement in a few special symmetric configurations @xcite .",
    "recent numerical calculations @xcite , on the other hand , have been developed to derive the hydrodynamic drag of a single sphere and a linear chain of spheres confined more strongly in quasi-2d .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the hydrodynamic drag of single spheres in weak confinement have been measured @xcite , and video microscopy has been applied recently to measure anisotropic particle diffusion , including ellipsoids in quasi-2d @xcite and 3d @xcite , colloidal clusters near one wall @xcite , and carbon nanotubes in weak confinement @xcite . in the present contribution we report measurements of hydrodynamic drag on ellipsoids in quasi-2d , confined between two parallel walls .",
    "we explore the strong confinement regime where drag coefficients are not readily available from theory and simulation , and we report on a light interference method to accurately measure the confinement .",
    "we find that the diffusion anisotropy is made stronger and the diffusion along ellipsoid short axes is dramatically slowed due to wall confinement .",
    "the experiment and analyses are similar to a previous paper @xcite .",
    "however the scope of the present work is different , focusing instead on how confinement affects diffusion , rather than on the detailed time - dependent brownian dynamics of a single ellipsoid with the greatest diffusion anisotropy .",
    "when a spheroid with semi - axes ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath18 ) moves along one of its principle axes with velocity @xmath19 , through an unbounded quiescent fluid with viscosity @xmath20 at low reynolds number , then the translational and rotational ( about short axis ) drag coefficients affecting the spheroid are    [ eq : stokes ] @xmath21 @xmath22    @xmath23 is the volume of the spheroid and @xmath24 is the geometric factor that renders the ellipsoid different relative to the case of a sphere .",
    "the geometric factors for prolate spheroids diffusing in 3d are analytically given by perrin s equations @xcite :    [ eq : g ] @xmath25},\\\\ \\label{eq : ga}\\ ] ] @xmath26},\\\\ \\label{eq : gb}\\ ] ] and  @xcite @xmath27}.\\\\ \\label{eq : gtheta}\\ ] ]     in eq .",

    "the diffusion of micrometer size pmma ( polymethyl methacrylate ) and ps ( polystyrene ) ellipsoids was measured in water confined between two glass walls . both ps and pmma ellipsoids",
    "are synthesized by the method described in ref .",
    "briefly , we placed 0.5% ( by weight ) ps spheres into a 12% ( by weight ) aqueous pva ( polyvinyl alcohol ) solution residing in a petri dish .",
    "after water evaporation , the pva film was stretched at 130@xmath34c .",
    "the ps ( or pmma ) spheres embedded in the film are readily stretched because their glass transition temperatures are below 130@xmath34c . after cooling to room temperature , the pva was dissolved and ellipsoids obtained .",
    "note , the initial pmma or ps spheres must not be cross - linked , otherwise they can not be stretched .",
    "we measured the size of ellipsoids by sem and by optical microscopy .",
    "the ellipsoid solutions were cleaned and stabilized with 7 mm sds ( sodium dodecyl sulfate ) .",
    "the ellipsoids were not expected to have strong interactions with the glass surfaces , because the solution ionic strength was more than 0.1 mm and the debye screening length for the particles was correspondingly less than 30 nm .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the ionic strength accurately in a thin cell because the glass surfaces can release na@xmath35 ions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we found that the addition of 2 mm salt to the solution did not induce a detectable change in particle diffusion coefficients .",
    "this observation suggests that the double layers are not significantly affecting particle diffusion .",
    "glass surfaces of the sample cell were rigorously cleaned in a 1:4 mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid by sonication",
    ". then the glass was thoroughly rinsed in deionized water and quickly dried with an air blow gun .",
    "typically 0.3 @xmath36 solution spread over the entire @xmath37 coverslip area , and ellipsoids did not stick to the surfaces .",
    "because the gravitational height , @xmath38 , is much larger than the cell thickness , @xmath39 , the ellipsoids were readily suspended around mid - plane between the two walls .",
    "finally , the cell was sealed with uv cured adhesive ( norland 63 ) .",
    "we measure the wall separation by light interference .",
    "when the cell thickness is below a few micrometers , then the interference colors produced by reflections from the two inner surfaces of the sample walls in white light illumination can be observed by eye or in the reflection mode of microscope , see fig .",
    "[ fig : microimages]a , b .",
    "when the wall separation @xmath40 , the effective light path difference is @xmath41 due to the @xmath42 phase shift of reflection at the lower surface .",
    "thus all wavelength components of the white light yield a dark black color in interference at @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath43 , the reflection light in the normal direction is a mixture of light with various wavelengths , and different wavelengths contribute with different weights to the observed color .",
    "white light interference from a wedge , for example , will be bands of colors as in the michel - levy chart @xcite . by comparing the observed color with the michel - levy chart",
    ", we can effectively read out the corresponding @xmath44 and obtain @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the refractive index of water . in the michel - levy chart ,",
    "the color starts from black at @xmath47 and changes from red to blue periodically with period @xmath48 nm . to avoid misreading the color by one or more periods",
    ", we either made a reference wedge or we put dilute spacer spheres with known diameter between the glass slides to establish a reference thickness . also , color bands may shift slightly because the illumination light is not an ideal white light source .",
    "this error however , should be less than @xmath49 , so that the error of @xmath39 is less than @xmath50 nm@xmath51 nm .",
    "although the absolute value of @xmath39 may be subject to @xmath52 uncertainty as described above , the relative values of different @xmath39 in one cell should be more accurate ( @xmath53 ) because we can easily distinguish more than 8 different colors in one band including deep red , light red , orange , light orange , yellow etc .",
    "usually our sample thickness had less than 20 nm variation in the central @xmath54 area and had 1 - 2 @xmath55 m variation over the whole @xmath56 area .",
    "thus , we can study the diffusion of ellipsoids at different @xmath39 in one cell .",
    "the interference between reflected light from top inner surface of the wall and the ellipsoid s top surface give rise to different colors ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : microimages ] ) . as is the case with newton s rings , the interference colors due to the two ellipsoid tips and the center of the ellipsoid were different .",
    "we found that the color only fluctuated near the two ellipsoid tips ; the color was quite constant near the ellipsoid center .",
    "thus the height fluctuation of the ellipsoids was very small and tumbling motions in the vertical plane were not strong .",
    "particle motions observed by microscopy were recorded by a ccd camera to videotape at 30 frames / sec . in the dilute suspension , only one ellipsoid was visible in the @xmath57 field of view under 100@xmath58 objective during a half - hour experiment .",
    "we defocus slightly so that the ellipsoid can be more accurately located along its long axis .",
    "the built - in 2d gaussian fit function in idl ( interactive data language ) was used to locate the center and orientation of the ellipse in each video frame . in practice ,",
    "a small percent ( @xmath593% ) of the frames failed to be correctly tracked . without these frames ,",
    "the trajectory breaks into short pieces and very long - time behavior becomes difficult to measure . to capture these frames , we very slightly adjusted tracking parameters or image contrast and re - analyzed the images ; after these corrections roughly @xmath60 of the frames remain incorrectly tracked .",
    "we then repeated this procedure iteratively until all @xmath5950000 frames in one dataset were correctly tracked .",
    "the mean square displacements ( msd ) at time lag @xmath61 has small non - zero intercept due to the tracking errors .",
    "thus we can estimate the spatial and angular resolution from intercepts of their corresponding msds @xcite .",
    "the orientation resolution is @xmath62 , and spatial resolutions are 0.5 pixel = 40 nm along the particle s short axis and 0.8 pixel = 64 nm along its long axis because of the superimposed small tumbling motion .    from the image analysis",
    ", we obtained the trajectory of a particle s center - of - mass positions @xmath63 in the lab frame and its orientation angle @xmath64 relative to the @xmath65-axis at times @xmath66 sec , see fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] .",
    "we define each @xmath67-sec time interval as a step . during the @xmath68 step , the particle s position changes by @xmath69 and its angle by @xmath70 . to obtain the drag coefficients along long and short axes , we need to covert the measured displacements from the fixed lab frame to the local body frame .",

    "the larger positive slopes exhibited by the more needle - like spheroids are indicative of motions more sensitive to confinement .",
    "furthermore , the slopes of the same ellipsoids in fig .",
    "[ fig : db ] are larger than those in fig .",
    "[ fig : da ] , indicating that diffusion along the ellipsoid short axis is more strongly affected by the confinement than diffusion along the long axis .",

    "this effect in rotational diffusion has been observed with depolarized dynamic light scattering in the regime where ionic concentration was low and spheroids small @xcite . in our systems",
    "such effects are expected to be small due to the high ionic strength of the suspension . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : da ] , [ fig : db ] and [ fig : dangle ] , diffusion coefficients are indistinguishable for the samples with 2 mm added salt and no added salt . the 6.9 nm screening layer of 2 mm solution lowers 3d diffusion coefficients by less than 2% .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : dratioab ] shows the impact of aspect ratio on the ratio @xmath2 . here it is evident that diffusion in quasi-2d is quite different from diffusion in 3d . for 3d",
    ", @xmath2 asympotes to 2 at large aspect ratio , as shown by the solid theoretical curve . for quasi-2d , @xmath2",
    ", on the other hand , grows very rapidly with increasing aspect ratio since we expect the stick boundary condition to hold in this system , the observation that @xmath128 should be purely due to confinement . a schematic to qualitatively capture this basic effect is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowfield ] .",
    "imagine the fluid flowing past the ellipsoid . in 3d , the fluid flow pathways will be displaced by distances of order @xmath9 in order to ` go around ' the ellipsoid .",
    "this fluid flow displacement is the approximately the same , whether the spheroid is orientated either parallel or perpendicular to the flow , and therefore @xmath13 and @xmath14 are comparable . in 2d , however , the fluid flow pathway displacement is approximately @xmath9 ( or @xmath8 ) when the spheroid is oriented parallel ( perpendicular ) to the flow , so that @xmath129 diverges with @xmath119 .",
    "this qualitative picture also explains our observation that diffusion along the ellipsoid short axes is more strongly affected by the confinement than diffusion along the long axis .",
    "finally , we note that in quasi-2d confinement , @xmath2 increases with increasing aspect ratio and should eventually saturate  @xcite at a value much larger than two , because some fluid will ` leak ' between the particle and walls .     in 3d , but has to flow around long axis @xmath8 in 2d . ]    in summary , we have found that the anisotropic drag coefficients for ellipsoid diffusion substantially increase when the ellipsoids are strongly confined , especially along the short axes . in the future",
    "many questions remain about these systems will be exciting to explore , including the effects of neighboring ellipsoids and the effects of other confinement geometries .",
    "for example , quasi-1d confinement of an ellipsoid will align the ellipsoid along the diffusion direction .",
    "this effect may compensate the drag from boundaries and lead to an optimal diameter for ellipsoid diffusion speed in a quasi-1d cylinder .",
