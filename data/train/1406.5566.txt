    "there is a fundamental paradox in the practice of theoretical physics .",
    "we do exact computations on integrable systems which have very special properties and then apply the intuition gained to generic systems which have none of the special properties which allowed the exact computations to be carried out .",
    "the ability to do exact computations relies on the existence of sufficient symmetries which allow the system to be solved by algebraic methods .",
    "generic systems do not possess such an algebra and the distinction between integrable and non - integrable may be thought of as the distinction of algebra versus analysis .",
    "this paradox is vividly illustrated by the two dimensional ising model . in zero magnetic field onsager",
    "@xcite computed the free energy by means of exploiting the algebra which now bears his name . on the other hand in 1999",
    "nickel @xcite analyzed the expansion of the susceptibility at zero magnetic field for the isotropic ising model on the square lattice and discovered that as a function of the variable @xmath2 the susceptibility has a dense set of singularities on the circle @xmath3 which is the same location as the thermodynamic limit of the locus of zeros of the finite lattice partition function . from this nickel concluded that the curve of zeros is a natural boundary of the susceptibility in the complex @xmath4 plane .",
    "this is a phenomenon of analysis not seen in any previously solved statistical system .",
    "further study of this new phenomenon has been made by orrick , nickel , guttmann and perk @xcite and in @xcite the phenomenon of the natural boundary was studied on the triangular lattice .",
    "however the implication of these results for other models has not been investigated .",
    "the hard square and hard hexagon models can be obtained from the ising model in a magnetic field @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 for the square and triangular lattices respectively , and thus it is natural to study the question of analyticity in these two models . however , unlike the ising model at @xmath7 where both the square and triangular lattices have been exactly solved , the hard hexagon model is exactly solved @xcite-@xcite whereas the hard square model is not .",
    "thus , the comparison of these two models is the ideal place to study the relation of integrability to the analyticity properties of the free energy in the complex plane .",
    "three different methods may be used to study the non - integrable hard square model : series expansions of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit , transfer matrix eigenvalues for chains of finite size @xmath8 and zeros of partition functions on the @xmath9 lattices of finite size and arbitrary aspect ratio @xmath10 .",
    "series expansions of the partition function per site @xmath11 of the hard square model @xcite-@xcite of up to 92 terms @xcite and analysis of transfer matrix eigenvalues @xcite for chains of up to 34 sites @xcite show that @xmath11 has a singularity on the positive @xmath12-axis @xcite @xmath13 and a singularity on the negative @xmath12-axis @xcite @xmath14 the hard hexagon model has two singular points at @xcite-@xcite @xmath15 for hard squares , series expansions @xcite-@xcite have been used to estimate the leading critical exponents at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and correction to scaling exponents have been estimated as well . for hard hexagons there are no singular points of the free energy other than @xmath18 .",
    "it is not known if there are any further singular points for hard squares . in @xcite",
    "the singularity at @xmath16 is determined to be in the ising universality class and in @xcite the first two exponents at @xmath17 are shown to agree with those of the lee - yang edge and hard hexagons .",
    "however these long series expansions have not given information about additional higher order singularities at @xmath16 and @xmath17 or singularities which may occur at other values of @xmath12 .    in 2005 a very remarkable property of hard squares , which is not shared by hard hexagons , was discovered @xcite by means of studying the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix for finite size systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these studies discovered that at the value of the fugacity @xmath1 all eigenvalues of the transfer matrix with cylindrical boundary conditions have unit modulus and the partition function of the @xmath19 lattice with toroidal boundary conditions depends on divisibility properties of @xmath20 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , the free energy for these boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit is zero . for the lattice oriented at @xmath21 ,",
    "on the other hand , for cylindrical boundary conditions of the transfer matrix , there are some eigenvalues which do not have unit modulus @xcite and for free boundary conditions of the transfer matrix with @xmath22 all roots of the characteristic equation are zero and thus the partition function vanishes .    in @xcite",
    "we computed for hard hexagons the zeros of the partition function for @xmath23 lattices with cylindrical and toroidal boundary conditions as large as @xmath24 and the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix with cylindrical boundary conditions . for these cylindrical transfer matrices",
    "both momentum and parity are conserved , and for physical ( positive ) values of @xmath12 the maximum eigenvector is in the sector of zero momentum positive parity @xmath25 . from these cylindrical transfer matrices we computed the equimodular curves where there are two eigenvalues of the row transfer matrix of ( equal ) maximum modulus both in the sector @xmath25 and for the full transfer matrix .    in this paper",
    "we extend our study of partition function zeros and transfer matrix equimodular curves to hard squares for systems as large as @xmath26 and compare them with corresponding results for hard hexagons @xcite .",
    "there are many differences between these two systems which we analyze in detail .",
    "in addition to the transfer matrix with cylindrical boundary conditions we also introduce the transfer matrix with free boundary conditions .",
    "thus we are able to give two different transfer matrix descriptions for the partition function zeros of the cylindrical lattice . for hard hexagons",
    "there is strong evidence that this boundary condition preserves integrability .    in section [ recall ]",
    "we recall the relation between finite size computations in the complex plane of zeros of @xmath23 lattices and eigenvalues of the @xmath27 site transfer matrix . in section [ compare ]",
    "we make a global comparison in the complex @xmath12 plane of the equimodular curves and partition function zeros of hard squares with hard hexagons . in section [ negz ]",
    "we make a more refined comparison on the negative @xmath12 axis .",
    "the comparisons presented in sections [ compare ] and [ negz ] reveal many significant differences between hard squares and hard hexagons which we discuss in detail in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] with a presentation of potential analyticity properties of hard squares which can be different from hard hexagons .    in [ appa ] we tabulate the factored characteristic polynomials of the transfer matrix at the point @xmath1 and the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath28 .",
    "we also give formulas for the growth of the orders of the transfer matrices , where such a formula is known , and for all cases the asymptotic growth is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the golden ratio .    in [ appb ]",
    "we consider the partition function values at @xmath1 on @xmath9 lattices for the torus , cylinder , free - free rectangle , mbius band and klein bottle boundary conditions .",
    "we give generating functions for the sequences of values of the partition function of the @xmath9 lattice as a function of @xmath20 and find that almost all sequences of values are repeating .",
    "we conjecture that along the periodic @xmath20 direction ( including twists for the mbius band and klein bottle cases ) the sequences will always be repeating .",
    "furthermore , for the torus and the cylinder ( along the periodic @xmath20 direction ) , we conjecture that the generating functions are given by the negative of the logarithmic derivative of the characteristic polynomial of their transfer matrices at @xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to conjecture the periods of their repeating sequences .",
    "finally , for the mbius band ( along the periodic @xmath20 direction ) and klein bottle we conjecture that their generating functions are the logarithmic derivative of products of factors @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are integers .",
    "the hard square lattice gas is defined by a ( occupation ) variable @xmath33 at each site of a square lattice with the restriction that no two adjacent sites can have the values @xmath34 ( i.e. the gas has nearest neighbor exclusion ) .",
    "the grand partition function on the finite @xmath35 lattice is defined as the polynomial @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of hard square configurations which have @xmath38 occupied sites .",
    "these polynomials can be characterized by their zeros @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath39 and the degree of the polynomial will depend on the boundary condition imposed on the lattice .",
    "this formulation of the partition function as a polynomial is completely general for lattice models with arbitrary interactions .",
    "the partition function for hard squares may also be expressed in terms of the transfer matrix formalism .",
    "for the cylindrical transfer matrix with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction , the transfer matrix for hard squares is defined as @xmath41 where the local boltzmann weights @xmath42 for hard squares of figure [ fig : bw ] may be written as @xmath43 with @xmath44 and otherwise @xmath45    for the transfer matrix with free boundary conditions @xmath46 where @xmath47 the corresponding transfer matrices for hard hexagons are obtained by supplementing ( [ bw1 ] ) with @xmath48    we will consider four types of boundary conditions .    the grand partition function for @xmath9 lattices with periodic boundary conditions in both the @xmath20 and @xmath8 directions is given in terms of @xmath49 as @xmath50    for free boundary conditions in the horizontal direction and periodic boundary conditions the vertical direction the partition function is obtained from @xmath51 as @xmath52    for periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction and free boundary conditions the vertical direction the partition function is obtained from @xmath49 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are suitable vectors for the boundary conditions on rows @xmath56 and @xmath20 . for the transfer matrix ( [ tmat ] ) with boltzmann weights given by the asymmetrical form ( [ bw1 ] ) , ( [ bw2 ] ) the components of the vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 for free boundary conditions are @xmath57 these vectors are invariant under translation and reflection .    for free boundary conditions in both directions @xmath58    when the transfer matrix is diagonalizable ( [ transper])-([freefree ] ) may be written in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath59 and eigenvectors @xmath60 of the transfer matrix @xmath61    for hard squares and hard hexagons the transfer matrices @xmath62 are invariant under translations and reflections and thus momentum @xmath63 and parity @xmath64 are good quantum numbers .",
    "furthermore the boundary vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 of ( [ vector ] ) are invariant under translation and reflection , and consequently @xmath67 unless the eigenvectors @xmath60 lie in the positive parity sector @xmath25 .    for hard squares",
    "the matrix @xmath68 is invariant under reflection so the eigenvectors in the scalar products are restricted to positive parity states .",
    "however for hard hexagons @xmath68 is not invariant under reflection and all eigenvectors will contribute to ( [ eigenff ] ) .",
    "note that partition function zeros for all four boundary conditions have previously been studied for antiferromagnetic potts models @xcite-@xcite . in that case",
    "the relations to transfer matrix eigenvalues were similar to ( [ eigenfc]),([eigenff ] ) .",
    "however , with periodic boundary conditions along the transfer direction the partition function was defined as a markov trace , and  ( [ eigent]),([eigencf ] ) were replaced by expressions involving non - trivial eigenvalue multiplicities @xcite .      to compare integrable with non - integrable systems a definition of integrability is required .",
    "the notion of integrability originates in the discovery by baxter that the ising model and the 6 and 8 vertex models , which have transfer matrices that depend on several variables , have a one parameter subspace for which the transfer matrices with different parameters will commute if cyclic boundary conditions are imposed @xcite .",
    "this global property of the transfer matrix follows from a local property of the boltzmann weights used to construct the transfer matrix , known as the star - triangle or the yang - baxter equation .",
    "the hard hexagon model has only one parameter , the fugacity , but is also referred to as integrable because baxter @xcite found that it may be realized as a special case of the model of hard squares with diagonal interactions which does have a one parameter family of commuting transfer matrices with cylindrical boundary conditions .",
    "this concept of integrability has been generalized to transfer matrices with boundary conditions which are not cylindrical if special boundary conditions are imposed which satisfy a generalization of the yang - baxter equation @xcite known as the boundary yang - baxter equation .",
    "this has been investigated for models closely related to hard hexagons @xcite but the specialization to hard hexagons with free boundary conditions has apparently not been made .      for thermodynamics",
    "we are concerned with the limit @xmath69 , and in the physical region where @xmath12 is real and positive the partition function per site @xmath70 , the physical free energy @xmath71 and the density @xmath72 are defined as limits of the finite size grand partition function as @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 this limit must be independent of the boundary conditions and aspect ratio @xmath76 for thermodynamics to be valid . the free energy vanishes and",
    "is analytic at @xmath77 . for hard hexagons as @xmath78 @xmath79 and for hard squares @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are analytic at @xmath78 . from this formulation series expansions of the free energy about both @xmath77 and @xmath83",
    "are derived .",
    "the partition function per site , physical free energy and density for @xmath84 and @xmath85 are different functions which are not related to each other by analytic continuation around the singularity at @xmath16 . for hard hexagons the density for both the low and the high density regime",
    "may be continued to the full @xmath12 plane which for low density is cut from @xmath86 and @xmath87 and for high density cut from @xmath88 . indeed , both the low and high density partition functions per site and the density for hard hexagons are algebraic functions @xcite and thus have analytic continuations even beyond the cuts in the @xmath12 plane .    to study the possibility of analytic continuation for hard squares of the physical partition function per site and density from the positive @xmath12 axis into the complex @xmath12 plane we consider both the formulation in terms of the transfer matrix and the zeros of the partition function .",
    "for @xmath89 all matrix elements of the transfer matrices are positive so the perron - frobenious theorem guarantees that the largest eigenvalue @xmath90 is positive and the corresponding eigenvector has all positive entries .",
    "thus for all cases @xmath91 and thus the free energy is @xmath92    furthermore the cylindrical transfer matrices for both squares and hexagons have translation and reflection invariance",
    ". therefore the eigenvalues of the lattice translation operator are @xmath93 where @xmath63 , the total momentum , has the values @xmath94 , and the eigenvalues of the reflection operator are @xmath95 .",
    "each transfer matrix eigenvalue has a definite value of @xmath63 and parity and @xmath90 has @xmath25 ( where @xmath96 indicates the reflection eigenvalue ) .",
    "therefore for @xmath97 the eigenvalue @xmath90 of the transfer matrix @xmath49 is the eigenvalue of an eigenvector in the sector @xmath25 .    to obtain the analytic continuation of the density from the positive @xmath12 axis into the complex @xmath12 plane we need to continue the limit as @xmath98 of the eigenvalue with @xmath25 which is maximum on the positive axis",
    "however , the analytic continuation of @xmath99 off of the segment @xmath100 will not , of course , have the largest modulus in the entire complex @xmath12 plane .",
    "the analytic continuation of @xmath90 will be maximum only as long as it has the largest modulus of all the eigenvalues and ceases to be maximum when @xmath12 crosses an equimodular curve where the moduli of two ( or more ) eigenvalues are the same .",
    "it is thus of importance to determine the thermodynamic limit of the equimodular curves of the largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the regions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are separated by one or more of these equimodular curves . in @xcite",
    "it was seen that for hard hexagons with finite @xmath8 the equimodular curves separate the @xmath12 plane into several regions . however , because the eigenvectors with different momentum and parity lie in different subspaces only the eigenvalues corresponding to eigenvectors with @xmath25 can affect the analytic continuation of the density .    for the hard square transfer matrix with free boundary conditions , @xmath68 , the eigenvalue @xmath101 will lie in the positive parity sector for positive @xmath12 and the analytic continuation off the positive real axis will be constrained to eigenvalues in the positive parity sector . for hard hexagons , where @xmath68 is not reflection symmetric , @xmath101 is not constrained to lie in a restricted sub - space .",
    "it is thus clear from the formulation of the physical free energy and the density in terms of the transfer matrix that the process of analytic continuation off of the positive @xmath12 axis and the taking of the thermodynamic limit do not commute . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "it is not even obvious that for a non - integrable model an analytic continuation through the limiting position of the equimodular curves is possible .",
    "the considerations of analytic continuation in terms of partition function zeros is slightly different because by definition polynomials are single valued .",
    "however , once the thermodynamic limit is taken the limiting locations of the zeros will in general divide the complex @xmath12 plane into disconnected zero free regions . for hard squares and hard hexagons the physical segments @xmath102 and",
    "@xmath103 lie in two separate zero free regions .",
    "the density is uniquely continuable into the zero free region and in these regions the free energy will be independent of boundary conditions and aspect ratio . for hard hexagons the density for both the low and high density cases are further continuable beyond the zero free region into the respective cut planes of section [ physicalfree ] .",
    "however , for hard squares there is no guarantee that further continuation outside the zero free regions is possible .      for finite lattices",
    "the partition function zeros can be obtained for @xmath104 and @xmath105 from ( [ eigent ] ) and ( [ eigencf ] ) if all eigenvalues are known . for @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    "both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are needed to obtain the zeros from ( [ eigenfc ] ) and ( [ eigenff ] ) .    the limiting case where @xmath108 is presented in @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite with various boundary conditions extending the work of @xcite-@xcite . in this limit ( [ emod1 ] )",
    "the partition function will have zeros when two or more maximum eigenvalues of @xmath109 have equal moduli latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{emod2 } \\hspace{-0.9 in } & & \\qquad \\quad   \\quad   \\quad    \\quad      consider first @xmath104 and @xmath111 where we see from ( [ eigent ] ) and ( [ eigencf ] ) that only eigenvalues are needed .",
    "thus , for these two cases , when only two largest eigenvalues @xmath112 need to be considered we may write @xmath113 . \\label{tapprox}\\ ] ] then at values of @xmath12 where @xmath114 with @xmath115 we have for large @xmath20 @xmath116\\ ] ] and hence @xmath117 will have a zero close to this @xmath12 when @xmath118 that is when @xmath119 with @xmath38 an integer .",
    "this relation becomes exact in the limit @xmath120 .",
    "calling @xmath121 and @xmath122 the values of @xmath12 at two neighboring zeros on the equimodular curve we thus obtain from ( [ thetan ] ) @xmath123    let @xmath124 be the arclength along an equimodular curve .",

    "thus writing @xmath132 the condition for a zero in the limit @xmath120 which generalizes ( [ thetalv ] ) is @xmath133 from which we obtain @xmath134 thus as @xmath120 the locus of zeros approaches the equimodular curve as @xmath135 and the limiting density is still given by ( [ phidensity ] ) .    these considerations , however , are in general not sufficient for the study of the thermodynamic limit where instead of ( [ emod1 ] ) we are interested in the limit @xmath136 and the physical free energy must be independent of the aspect ratio @xmath10 .    to study the limit ( [ thermolimit ] ) there are several properties of the dependence of the equimodular curves on @xmath8 which need to be considered :",
    "1 .   the derivative of the phase @xmath137 on a curve can vanish as @xmath98 on some portions of the curve ; 2 .",
    "the number of equimodular curves can diverge as @xmath98 and there can be regions in the @xmath12 plane where they become dense ; 3 .",
    "the length of an equimodular curve can vanish as @xmath138 .",
    "the first of these properties is illustrated for hard hexagons in @xcite .",
    "the second and third properties have been observed for antiferromagnetic potts models in @xcite .",
    "we will see that all three phenomena are present for hard squares .",
    "the roots of the @xmath23 partition function in the limit @xmath139 converge to lie on the @xmath140 limit of the equimodular curves .",
    "in @xcite we computed for hard hexagons the zeros for @xmath23 lattices of @xmath141 for toroidal boundary conditions , and for cylindrical boundary conditions where @xmath142 we also computed the equimodular curves for both the full transfer matrix @xmath62 relevant to @xmath104 and the restriction to the subspace @xmath25 relevant for @xmath106 . in this paper",
    "we compute the same quantities for hard squares and compare them with the results of @xcite .",
    "we also compute the equimodular curves for @xmath68 relevant for @xmath105 and @xmath107 . for hard hexagons we restricted attention to @xmath143 multiples of three which",
    "is commensurate with hexagonal ordering .",
    "similarly for hard squares we restrict attention here to @xmath143 even to be commensurate with square ordering .",
    "we have computed zeros of the hard square partition function in the complex fugacity @xmath12 plane for @xmath23 lattices with cylindrical and free boundary conditions for @xmath144 and for toroidal boundary conditions for @xmath145 using the methods of @xcite . in figure",

    "<S> we consider partition functions for toroidal , cylindrical , and free - free boundary conditions up to sizes @xmath0 and transfer matrices up to 30 sites . for all boundary conditions the hard squares roots are seen to lie in a bounded area of the complex fugacity plane along with the universal hard core line segment on the negative real fugacity axis . </S>",
    "<S> the density of roots on this line segment matches the derivative of the phase difference between the eigenvalues of largest ( and equal ) moduli and exhibits much greater structure than the corresponding density of hard hexagons . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the special point @xmath1 of hard squares where all eigenvalues have unit modulus , and we give several conjectures for the value at @xmath1 of the partition functions .    * integrability vs non - integrability *    * hard hexagons and hard squares compared *    * ams classification scheme numbers * : 34m55 , 47e05 , 81qxx , 32g34 , 34lxx , 34mxx , 14kxx .5 cm    </S>",
    "<S> * key - words * : hard square model , hard hexagon model , partition function zeros , equimodular curves </S>"
