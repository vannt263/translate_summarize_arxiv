    "the phase - transformation kinetics in systems undergoing first - order phase transitions are important in many scientific and technological disciplines . around 1940 ,",
    "kolmogorov,@xcite johnson and mehl,@xcite and avrami@xcite ( kjma ) introduced a simple theory describing the decay of a metastable system towards a unique equilibrium phase .",
    "this theory applies to systems with a nonconserved order parameter , in which the decay is driven by a difference between the free - energy densities of the metastable and equilibrium phases .",
    "originally conceived for metallurgical applications , it was later formalized and generalized by evans,@xcite who also pointed out its applicability in surface science .",
    "the basic assumptions of the kjma theory are simple : negligibly small `` droplets '' of the equilibrium phase nucleate from the uniform metastable phase and subsequently grow without substantial deformation .",
    "the growing droplets are assumed to be randomly placed and overlap freely , with the result that the remaining volume fraction occupied by the metastable phase decays exponentially with a power of time : @xmath0 both the coefficient @xmath1 and the `` avrami exponent ''",
    "@xmath2 depend on the spatial dimension @xmath3 and on details of the nucleation and growth processes . in general , @xmath4 ; thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro ] ) does _ not _ represent a stretched exponential .",
    "the kjma picture has been extensively applied in diverse fields of research.@xcite a small selection of examples include transitions between different liquid - crystal phases;@xcite crystallization kinetics in lipids,@xcite sugars,@xcite polymers,@xcite and eutectic mixtures;@xcite solid - state phase transformations;@xcite domain switching in ferroelectrics and ferromagnets;@xcite adsorption and surface growth kinetics in electrochemical or gas / vacuum environments;@xcite rock formation;@xcite and slow combustion.@xcite    during the first forty years after its inception , the kjma theory appears to have been appreciated mostly by experimentalists .",
    "it attracted little sustained theoretical interest until the 1980s , when sekimoto derived exact expressions for the two - point phase correlation function within the kjma picture.@xcite knowledge of correlation functions makes it possible to predict and interpret the results of small - angle scattering experiments . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how it can also be utilized to obtain independent estimates of the droplet nucleation rate and growth velocity .",
    "sekimoto s results have been generalized to systems with infinitely degenerate equilibrium phases@xcite and to the case of finite degeneracy.@xcite we shall refer collectively to the theories that extend the kjma picture to include correlation functions as the `` extended kjma theory . '' among recent applications of the extended kjma theory are theoretical studies of domain switching in ferroelectrics predictions of magnetic - force - microscopy observables for nanoscale ferromagnets,@xcite and studies of hysteresis in spatially extended systems.@xcite relations between two - point correlation functions and droplet size distributions have also been discussed recently.@xcite    there are many simplifying assumptions inherent in the extended kjma theory .",
    "these include a constant nucleation rate , a constant interfacial propagation velocity , and the neglect of surface - tension effects that one would expect to become important when growing droplets meet and coalesce . in view of this , it is remarkable that the theory appears to perform as well as it does for such a wide variety of systems .",
    "computer studies have previously been performed for models in which droplets of a fixed shape nucleate , either deterministically or randomly , and thereafter grow deterministically.@xcite however , we are only aware of a single previous study@xcite in which the kinetic processes act on length and time scales that are _ microscopic _ compared to the growing droplets , as one would expect for real physical and chemical systems .",
    "such studies are desirable , as they permit direct verification of the regimes of validity for the individual assumptions as well as the consequences of particular assumptions not being exactly fulfilled . in the present paper",
    "we further address this need , with particular emphasis on the information which can be obtained by combining results for the volume fraction and the two - point correlation functions .",
    "our purpose is two - fold , as discussed below .",
    "our first aim is to perform a detailed test of the validity of the extended kjma theory in a particular model system with microscopic kinetics .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional kinetic ising model of ferromagnetic or ferroelectric switching .",
    "this is equivalent to a simple lattice - gas model of submonolayer chemisorption onto a single - crystal surface in the limit that lateral diffusion can be ignored.@xcite for this model we test the kjma predictions for time - dependent quantities that describe the mesoscopic two - phase structure during the evolution towards equilibrium .",
    "these quantities include the volume fraction , the two - point correlation function , and its fourier transform , the structure factor .",
    "we find excellent quantitative agreement between the theoretical predictions and the simulation results for a considerable range of applied fields and times .",
    "our second aim springs from the significant regime of agreement that we establish between the kjma predictions and the simulation results for the model studied .",
    "this enables us to use the kjma prediction for the volume fraction to subtract those regions of the system which have already decayed to the stable phase at a particular time , and thus measure extended time and volume averages of the quasi - equilibrium order parameter in the metastable phase .",
    "this approach represents a novel method to measure `` thermodynamic '' quantities in a constrained metastable ensemble.@xcite furthermore , the extended kjma predictions for the two - point correlation functions enable us to measure separately the nucleation rate and the average propagation velocity of the convoluted , moving interface between the metastable and stable phase regions . we show that the measured quantities agree well with theoretical predictions obtained by different methods .",
    "these methods are numerical transfer - matrix calculations for the metastable order parameter,@xcite a field - theoretical result for the nucleation rate,@xcite and a nonlinear response theory for the interface velocity.@xcite the close agreement between the kjma and independent estimates confirms that the kjma theory does not merely produce good fits to the simulation data , but that the fitting parameters measure nonequilibrium physical quantities that can be difficult to measure by other methods .",

    "<S> the kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami ( kjma ) theory for the time evolution of the order parameter in systems undergoing first - order phase transformations has been extended by sekimoto to the level of two - point correlation functions . here </S>",
    "<S> , this extended kjma theory is applied to a kinetic ising lattice - gas model , in which the elementary kinetic processes act on microscopic length and time scales . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical framework is used to analyze data from extensive monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is inherently a mesoscopic continuum picture , and in principle it requires a large separation between the microscopic scales and the mesoscopic scales characteristic of the evolving two - phase structure . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we find excellent quantitative agreement with the simulations in a large parameter regime , extending remarkably far towards strong fields ( large supersaturations ) and correspondingly small nucleation barriers . </S>",
    "<S> the original kjma theory permits direct measurement of the order parameter in the metastable phase , and using the extension to correlation functions one can also perform separate measurements of the nucleation rate and the average velocity of the convoluted interface between the metastable and stable phase regions . </S>",
    "<S> the values obtained for all three quantities are verified by other theoretical and computational methods . </S>",
    "<S> as these quantities are often difficult to measure directly during a process of phase transformation , data analysis using the extended kjma theory may provide a useful experimental alternative . </S>"
