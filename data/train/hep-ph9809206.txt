    "recent atmospheric neutrino data by superkamiokande @xcite provide strong evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that atmospheric neutrino data favor @xmath2 oscillations with maximal mixing , rather than @xmath3 .",
    "however , @xmath4 disappearance alone does not imply uniquely a @xmath2 solution and there is another solution @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes a sterile neutrino . in this talk some aspects of the @xmath2 and @xmath5 solutions",
    "are discussed .    in the past",
    "there has been a prejudice against the @xmath5 solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem .",
    "the argument @xcite was based on big bang nucleosynthesis which gives a condition @xmath7ev@xmath8 in order for sterile neutrinos not to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , there was a loophole in this argument .",
    "foot and volkas @xcite have shown that large lepton asymmetries will suppress @xmath9 neutrino oscillations .",
    "interestingly , given certain conditions , the required lepton asymmetries can actually be created by the oscillations themselves @xcite . so there is no longer any obstruction to @xmath5 as a solution to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "many models @xcite have been proposed which predict large or maximal active - sterile mixing . among others , foot and volkas",
    "have been obsessed by exact parity symmetric models @xcite and this was the main motivation of @xcite in which @xmath5 was examined in detail by fitting to the contained events of the superkamiokande atmospheric neutrino data for 414 days .",
    "the survival probability @xmath10 is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for neutrino evolution including matter effects .",
    "it is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mns mixing matrix @xcite , @xmath13 is the distance traveled , @xmath14 the difference in squared masses , @xmath15 the vacuum mixing angle and @xmath16 the wave - functions of the neutrinos .",
    "the quantities @xmath17 are the effective potential differences generated through the matter effect @xcite : @xmath18 and , for electrically neutral terrestrial matter @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fermi constant , @xmath21 is the number density of neutrons along the path of the neutrino .",
    "it is this matter effect @xmath22 that make a difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath5 oscillations .",
    "for antineutrinos the sign of @xmath23 is reversed .    the way to obtain the numbers of events and evaluate @xmath24",
    "is described in @xcite , where two quantities have been introduced to perform a @xmath24 analysis .",
    "one is the double ratio @xcite @xmath25 where the quantities @xmath26 are the numbers of @xmath27-like and @xmath28-like events .",
    "the numerator denotes numbers with oscillation probability obtained by ( [ eqn : sch ] ) , while the denominator the numbers expected with oscillations switched off .",
    "the other one is the quantity on up - down flux asymmetries for @xmath29-like ( @xmath29=e,@xmath28 ) events and is defined by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the zenith angle , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the number of upward and downward going events , respectively .",
    "@xmath24 with the double ratio @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 and @xmath24 with the up - down asymmetry @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over the sub - gev and multi - gev cases , the measured superkamiokande values and errors are denoted by the superscript `` sk '' and the theoretical predictions for the quantities are labeled by `` th '' .    3.4 cm    3.1 cm    to    to    to    to    to    to    the results of the @xmath24 fits are displayed in figs.18 . in figs . 1 and 2 , @xmath24 is plotted against @xmath14 . for @xmath2",
    ", @xmath24 does not experience a deep minimum at the best fit point with respect to @xmath14 particularly when the @xmath34 s are excluded from the fit .",
    "in general , for geometrical reasons , atmospheric neutrino analysis does not constrain @xmath14 very precisely .",
    "note that the the situation is slightly different in case of @xmath5 .",
    "figure 3 shows the allowed region of @xmath38 at various confidence levels for the @xmath0 scenario .",
    "maximal mixing provides the best fit , and @xmath14 values in the @xmath39 to @xmath40 ev@xmath8 range are favored .",
    "note that the confidence levels are defined in the usual way by @xmath41 where @xmath42 for the @xmath43 , @xmath44 c.l .",
    ", @xmath45 and @xmath46 allowed region respectively .",
    "our @xmath47 for @xmath0 oscillations is @xmath48 for @xmath49 degrees of freedom .",
    "this is quite a good fit to the data ( allowed at the @xmath50 level ) . in figure 4",
    "we show the allowed region considering just the asymmetries instead of using both the asymmetries and the @xmath34 ratios .",
    "note that in this case there are 4 data points and 2 free parameters which gives 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "figures 58 show the corresponding results for the @xmath1 scenario . if @xmath51 , smaller values of @xmath14 are disfavored because the matter effect moves both @xmath34 and @xmath52 away from the measured values , but if @xmath53 , then smaller values of @xmath14 and @xmath54 are permitted at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the value of @xmath47 for the @xmath55 scenario is @xmath56 for @xmath49 degrees of freedom .",
    "this is similar to @xmath57 case and also represents quite a good fit ( which is allowed at @xmath58 ) .    to summarize , both the solutions @xmath0 and @xmath55 provide a good fit to the contained events of the superkamiokande atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "there have been several proposals to distinguish the @xmath2 and @xmath5 oscillations .",
    "matter effects in @xmath5 oscillations in upward going muon data were first analyzed by akhmedov , lipari and lusignoli @xcite and more recently by lipari and lusignoli @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out by liu , smirnov @xcite and liu , mikheyev , smirnov @xcite that signatures due to parametric enhancement in @xmath5 oscillations may be seen in upward going muon data .",
    "vissani and smirnov @xcite proposed to look at the ratio ( @xmath59-events)/(two ring events ) . learned , pakvasa and stone @xcite suggested that the up - down asymmetry ( upward going @xmath59-events)/(downward going @xmath59-events ) can tell a difference .",
    "hall and murayama @xcite proposed a similar technique to use the up - down asymmetry in the multi - ring events .",
    "kajita @xcite mentioned the ratio ( @xmath59-events)/(e - like events ) which should in principle enable us to distinguish .",
    "all these analyses seem to be still inconclusive and we need more statistics and accurate knowledge on nuclear cross sections to draw a conclusion .",
    "we have demonstrated that matter effects in the earth have a significant role to play in comparing and contrasting the @xmath2 and @xmath5 solutions to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly with superkamiokande data .",
    "so far both solutions provide a good fit to the data and we need more statistics to be conclusive . we hope that non - accelerator experiments such as superkamiokande will distinguish them before future long baseline experiments with emulsion techniques @xcite give direct evidence .",
