    "the mechanism that governs the electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) is at present the largest unknown in the standard model(sm ) . in order to solve the problem of ewsb",
    ", some new physics models beyond the sm have been proposed , such as : supersymmetry ( susy ) and dynamical ewsb mechanism concerning new strong interactions , etc . an important goal of studies at the next generation of positron - electron(@xmath5 ) colliders is the proper understanding of the ewsb , and the discovery of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "if the new particles or interactions will be directly discovered at the tevatron and lhc , the linear colliders will then play a crucial role in the detailed and thorough study of these new phenomena and in the reconstruction of the underlying fundamental theories .",
    "the international linear collider(ilc)@xcite is a worldwide consensus linear accelerator @xmath5 collisions in the energy range of 500 gev to above tev . by compton backscattering of laser photons off the electron and positron beams",
    ", one can produce high luminosity @xmath6 collisions with a wide spectrum of @xmath6 center - of - mass energy .",
    "in addition , a high degree of circular polarization for each of the colliding photons can be achieved by polarizing the incoming electron and positron beams and the laser beams@xcite .",
    "photon colliders have distinct advantages in searches for and measurements of new physics objects . in general , phenomena in @xmath5 and @xmath7",
    "collisions are similar because the same particles can be produced .",
    "however , the reactions are different and the photon colliders often give complementary information .",
    "some phenomena can be studied better at photon colliders due to higher statistical accuracy . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross sections of some processes in @xmath6 collisions are larger than those in @xmath5 collisions . in the hunt for physics beyond the sm",
    ", only small signs may be visible , therefore , the photon colliders provide optimal conditions for searching for the new physics .    among the new physics models , technicolor(tc ) model is a promising candidate of dynamical theories@xcite .",
    "however , it is hard for technicolor to generate the fermion masses , specially , the heavy top quark mass . in order to overcome the shortcoming of the simple tc model and",
    "explain the large mass problem of the top quark , an interesting tc model , called the topcolor assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) model , is proposed @xcite which gives a reasonable explanation of the ewsb and heavy top quark mass . in the tc2 model ,",
    "the topcolor interaction makes small contribution to the ewsb , and gives rise to the main part of the top quark mass @xmath8 with a model dependant parameter @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the technicolor interaction plays a main role in the breaking of electroweak gauge symmetry . to account for the explicit breaking of quark and lepton flavor symmetries , the extended technicolor(etc )",
    "was invented .",
    "the etc interaction gives rise to the masses of the ordinary fermions including a very small portion of the top quark mass @xmath10 .",
    "this kind of model predicts three cp odd top - pions @xmath11,@xmath12 with large yukawa couplings to the third family .",
    "the lep - sld precision measurement data of @xmath13 give a severe constraint on the mass of the charged top - pion@xcite .",
    "even in an optimistic estimate the mass of the charged top - pion should be larger than 220 gev .",
    "because the top - pions are the typical physical particles of the tc2 model , the observation of top - pions can be regarded as the direct evidence of the tc2 model .",
    "the study of the various top - pion production mechanisms is well motivated which can offer the useful instruction to search for the top - pions . via the @xmath5 collisions",
    ", the neutral top - pion can be produced via the processes @xmath14 .",
    "the main charged top - pion production mechanism are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , these processes have been systematically studied@xcite .",
    "the photon colliders will offer another chance to search for the top - pions .",
    "we have studied the potential to discover the neutral top - pion via the processes @xmath17@xcite . in general , the cross sections of above processes are at the level of @xmath18 fb , and it is promising to observe the top - pions at future linear colliders with high luminosity . also , the charged top - pion production processes at the photon collider have been studies in the reference @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutral top - pion can also be produced as s - channel resonances in the process @xmath19 through top quark triangle loop and thus the full photon beam energy can be used to produce the heavy particle .",
    "the similar work has been done in the framework of a rescaled qcd models and the loe - scale tc model@xcite . in this paper , we calculate the cross section of @xmath1 and study the possibility to observe the neutral top - pion via its various decay modes .",
    "we find that , with large cross section , @xmath1 can provide a unique way to identify the neutral top - pion with high precision . among the various decay modes of @xmath20",
    ", @xmath21 is a typical one due to the existence of the tree - level coupling @xmath22 .",
    "because there exists gim(glashow , iliopoulos , and maiani ) mechanism in the sm , @xmath23 production rate in the sm is too small to observe @xmath23 , the observable signal of @xmath23 might be a sound evidence of the new physics .",
    "so , @xmath21 is the ideal mode to observe @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath23 production processes via photon - photon collision have been studied in some new physics models(the two higgs doublet model(model iii ) , minimal supersymmetic standard model(mssm ) and tc2 model@xcite .",
    "the study shows that the production rate of @xmath23 can reach the observable level in these new physics models . in our paper , the possibility to observe the neutral top - pion via other modes is also systematically studied .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we describe the details of our calculation and give some analytic formulae . in the third section",
    ", we discuss the numerical results and give some conclusions .",
    "as it is well known , the couplings of the top - pions to the three family fermions are non - universal .",
    "the top - pions have large yukawa couplings to the third family and can induce large flavor changing couplings .",
    "the couplings of the neutral top - pion to quarks can be written as@xcite : @xmath24.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , and @xmath27 gev is the top - pion decay constant .",

    "@xmath30 reflects the effect of the mixing between the top - pions and the would - be goldstone bosons .",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the elements of the rotation matrices @xmath35 which are needed for diagonalizing the quark mass matrices .",
    "the matrix elements are given as @xmath36 in this paper , we take @xmath37 and typically take @xmath38 .    with the coupling @xmath39 , @xmath20 couples to a pair of photon via top quark triangle",
    "loop(the contribution of bottom quark loop is much smaller than that of top quark loop , we ignore such contribution here ) .",
    "we explicitly calculate the top quark triangle loop and obtain the effective coupling of @xmath40 as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the standard three - point feynman integral with @xmath43 donating the momentum of @xmath20 and @xmath44 denoting the momentum of an incoming photon .",
    "single @xmath20 can be produced via photon - photon fusion process @xmath45 .",
    "the lowest order parton cross section can be expressed by the decay width of @xmath46@xcite : @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath6 center - of - mass(c.m . )",

    "their decay widths can be easily obtained as :    @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    with @xmath64 @xmath65^{-1},\\ ] ] here , @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the momenta of @xmath20 and one gluon , respectively .    after calculating the cross section @xmath68 for the subprocess @xmath69",
    ", we can obtain the total cross section at the @xmath5 linear collider by folding @xmath68 with the photon distribution function @xmath70 : @xmath71 here , we denote @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the @xmath5 c.m .",

    "@xmath77 , @xmath78 are the incident electron energy and the laser - photon energy .",
    "@xmath79 stands for the fraction of energy of the incident electron carried by the back - scattered photon .",
    "@xmath80 vanishes for @xmath81 . in order to avoid the creation of @xmath5 pairs by the interaction of the incident and back - scattered photons , we require @xmath82 which implies that @xmath83 .",
    "taking @xmath84 , we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the up - limit and down - limit of integral as : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "to obtain the numerical results , we take @xmath90 gev , @xmath91 gev . from the one - loop evaluation formula ,",
    "we can obtain the value of @xmath92 at energy scale of ilc . therefore , there leave three free parameters : @xmath93 , @xmath5 c.m .",
    "energy @xmath94 and the mass of top - pion @xmath51 . to see the effect of @xmath51 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 on the cross section , we plot , in fig.1 - 3 , the cross section @xmath95 as a function of @xmath51 with @xmath38 and @xmath96 gev , respectively .",
    "we can see that the cross section is at the level of tens fb to a hundred fb .",
    "there exists a peak in the plot when @xmath51 is near @xmath97 which arises from the top quark triangle loop . on the other hand",
    ", it is shown that the increasing of @xmath94 can depress the cross section .",
    "the neutral top - pion should be detected via its decay modes .",
    "we know that the possible decay modes of @xmath20 are @xmath98(if @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath6 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "the tree level decay modes @xmath98 , @xmath23 @xmath101 and the loop level decay mode @xmath102 are the main decay modes of @xmath20 . the decaying branching ratios of the main decay modes are shown in fig.4 .",
    "we can see that @xmath20 almost decays to @xmath98 when @xmath99 .",
    "the decay branching ratio of @xmath104 is the largest one when @xmath98 mode is forbidden .",
    "we focus on studying the potential to observe the @xmath20 via these main decay modes .",
    "the event number of the signal via each mode can be obtained via the formula @xmath105 . the event number plot versus @xmath51",
    "is shown in fig.5 with @xmath106 gev , @xmath107 and the yearly luminosity @xmath108 .",
    "we can see that the event number of signal @xmath109 is significantly depressed when @xmath58 is open .",
    "there are @xmath110 @xmath98 events can be produced for heavy @xmath111 .",
    "the total cross section of @xmath112 is at the level of @xmath113 at tev energy scale@xcite in the sm .",
    "the number of @xmath98 event produced via heavy @xmath114 decaying is comparable to that in the sm .",
    "such @xmath20 contribution to the @xmath98 production should be easily detected at the planned ilc .",
    "therefore , the significant deviation of @xmath98 production from the sm prediction might provide the clue of @xmath20 existence .",
    "but it is difficult to identify @xmath20 via @xmath98 mode .",
    "the reason is that the decay width of @xmath58 is very large and the peak of @xmath98 invariant distribution is too wide to be observed , we can not identify @xmath20 via the @xmath98 invariant distribution .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that @xmath98 is an ideal mode to search for the clue of tc2 model but it is not suitable to confirm the existence of heavy @xmath20 . because topcolor is non - universal",
    ", there exists the flavor - changing coupling of the neutral top - pion to top and charm quarks .",
    "so , @xmath20 can decay to @xmath23 at tree - level which is the typical feature of the tc2 model .",
    "now , we discuss the potential to observe @xmath20 via @xmath23 mode . for the light @xmath20 ,",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath21 is the largest one . over @xmath115 @xmath23 events",
    "can be produced with the integral luminosity @xmath116 . for heavy @xmath20",
    ", the @xmath23 events significantly drop to @xmath117 with the opening of @xmath98 mode . in order to obtain a sound conclusion about the potential to observe the @xmath20",
    ", we should consider the sm background and b - tagging and c - tagging efficiency .",
    "if we detect @xmath20 via @xmath23 , the only irreducible background arises from @xmath118 in the sm , the sm cross section of such process is much small(at the level of @xmath119@xcite ) , therefore , the perfect identification of @xmath23 can make the background become very clean . to identify @xmath23 , we should reconstruct top quark from its decay mode @xmath120 .",
    "so , the b - tagging and c - tagging are need to identify @xmath23 .",
    "we take b - tagging efficiency as @xmath121 and c - tagging efficiency as @xmath122@xcite , there are also enough @xmath23 events which can be identified . for example , we typically take @xmath23 events as @xmath115 , there are about @xmath123 @xmath23 can be tagged , the corresponding statistical uncertainty at the @xmath124 c.l .",
    "is @xmath125 .",
    "so , with the clean background , the large number of @xmath23 events tagged and the observation of the peak of the @xmath23 invariant mass distribution , we can obtain the clear signal of neutral top - pion with high precision . as it is shown in fig.5 , a lot of @xmath102 events can also be produced via @xmath126 which leads to 2-jets .",
    "it is difficult to identify @xmath20 via such 2-jets .",
    "so , @xmath102 mode is not suitable to observe @xmath20 . for the @xmath101 mode , there are over @xmath127 @xmath101 events can be produced via light @xmath20 decaying .",
    "the dominant background to @xmath128 comes from the sm process @xmath129 .",
    "various techniques can be used to suppress these background .",
    "the most effective technique appears to be to polarize the initial - state photons : @xmath20 are only produced from an initial state with spin @xmath130 , whereas , the leading - order @xmath131 background are dominantly produced from the @xmath132 initial state .",
    "more precisely , production from the @xmath130 state is suppressed by @xmath133@xcite .",
    "hence , in the region of the @xmath20 resonance , the @xmath134 background are heavily suppressed if we choose initial state with @xmath130 . on the other hand ,",
    "the processes @xmath135 can mimic a two - jet event .",
    "so , such processes in the sm are also the important background .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath133 suppressions do not necessarily apply to the qcd corrected processes @xmath136 and the largest background is from the @xmath137 .",
    "the existence of @xmath138 background make the potential to observe @xmath20 via @xmath101 mode become unclear , and a detail study is needed which is beyond this paper .",
    "furthermore , in the sm or the mssm , there exists the similar process @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , to identify the @xmath20 via @xmath101 mode , we should also find the different feature between @xmath140 and @xmath141 . from above discussion",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath142 is an ideal mode to detect neutral top - pion which can provide enough typical @xmath20 signals .    in summary",
    ", the running of ilc with high energy and luminosity will provide a good chance to test the new physics models .",
    "with the realization of photon - photon collision , the neutral top - pion can be produced as s - channel resonances in the process @xmath1 which is the most important production mechanism of neutral top - pion . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the cross section of the process @xmath19 and discuss the potential to observe the neutral top - pion via its various decay modes .",
    "the result shows that the cross section is at the level of tens fb to a hundred fb .",
    "the possible decay modes of @xmath20 are @xmath98(if @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath6 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 . for the mode @xmath21 ,",
    "there are @xmath110 @xmath23 events can be produced with the integral luminosity @xmath143 and the sm background is very clean .",
