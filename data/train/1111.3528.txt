    "recently topological insulator has attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "topological insulator has been firstly predicted in a graphene with spin - orbit interaction @xcite , which consists of two copies of quantum hall system , and shows a quantized spin hall effect if @xmath2component of spin of electrons is conserved .",
    "generally speaking , the present non ",
    "trivial system is characterized by @xmath3index introduced by fu , kane , and mele @xcite , and has a gapless helical edge mode where spin current protected by time  reversal symmetry flows spontaneously .",
    "however , quantum spin hall ( qsh ) phase of graphene has not been observed experimentally since the spin ",
    "orbit interaction that is the driving force of topological insulator is much small .",
    "after that , hgte / hgcdte quantum well has been theoretically proposed as a candidate of two  dimensional topological insulator @xcite , and confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "topological insulators have been realized in three dimensional systems @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , bi@xmath4sb@xmath5 alloy @xcite , the binary compounds bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite , and tl  based ternary compound tlbise@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the quaternary compounds have also been theoretically predicted @xcite .",
    "all of these systems have a single helical dirac cone on the surface .",
    "nowadays , many exotic quantum phenomena are expected originating from surface states of three  dimensional topological insulators @xcite . however , in the actual systems , sufficient amount of carriers remain in the bulk due to the difficulty of fabrication of samples @xcite . then the system becomes metallic and it is difficult to classify physical properties specific to surface dirac cone @xcite . to resolve this problem , several approaches , _",
    "e.g. , _ chemical doping and surface adsorption @xcite have been performed .",
    "the another new approach to control the carrier is to fabricate high quality thin films , where carrier control by gating is possible @xcite .",
    "but thin films may have the different electronic states from that of the bulk .",
    "especially , the surface states have an energy gap due to the hybridization between the dirac cones on top and bottom on the film induced by finite  size effect . based on above backgrounds , experimental studies of thin films of topological insulators",
    "have started @xcite . besides this , there have been many theoretical studies based on continuous models @xcite , first principle calculations @xcite , and tight  binding model calculation @xcite .",
    "although continuous model is simple , it is valid only for the long wavelength and low  energy limits .",
    "first principle calculation gives detailed electronic states of thin film .",
