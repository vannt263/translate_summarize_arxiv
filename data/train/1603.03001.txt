    "the generalized linear failure rate ( glfr ) distribution is defined by @xcite and contains various well - known distributions : the generalized exponential ( ge ) distribution introduced by @xcite , the generalized rayleigh distribution introduced by @xcite , the exponential , rayleigh , and linear failure rate ( lfr ) distributions are its special cases .",

    "unfortunately , the glfr distribution can not have unimodal hrf .",
