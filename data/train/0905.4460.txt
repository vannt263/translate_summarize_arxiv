    "stellar rotation has now been fully incorporated into evolutionary models of massive stars ( eg . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , prompted by several observational facts that were unexplained by previous models without rotation ( eg . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and that pointed to a solution related to mixing .",
    "for example , @xcite had found that many o stars , and in particular fast rotators , show an enhanced he abundance ; they called this the _ helium discrepancy_.",
    "the models including rotation have been very successful in reproducing the observed abundances , predicting higher he and n abundances for higher masses and higher rotation velocities .",
    "evolutionary models with rotation have also provided a solution for many other previously unexplained observations such as the well - known blue - to - red supergiant ratio ( b / r ) problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , when neglecting rotation , evolutionary models were unable to reproduce the rapid increase in b / r with increasing metallicity .",
    "as the new models predict many more red supergiants at low metallicity coupled with a shorter blue supergiant phase , they provided a natural solution .",
    "it is now clear that rotation is an important factor in our understanding of massive stars and their evolution .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare theoretical predictions with the available observational data . for o stars ,",
    "the latest homogenous , large - scale surveys of projected rotational velocities have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite , who respectively studied 177 and 373 stars , the latter also including early - type b stars .",
    "these studies were both based on high - resolution iue spectra and used a cross - correlation technique with a narrow - line template spectrum to measure the rotational speeds .",
    "both studies note the absence of very narrow lines for supergiants while some smaller velocities are found for main - sequence stars . instead of interpreting this as a possible increase in rotational velocities as the star evolves , these authors favour an additional broadening mechanism such as macro - turbulence .",
    "in fact , @xcite strengthens this assertion by pointing out that the shape of the absorption lines expected from pure rotation is a poor match to the observed profiles and that a line dominated by transverse turbulence is a much better match . ignoring this possible effect ( most likely small ) of macro - turbulence on the projected rotational velocities , their distribution peaks at @xmath1 80 kms@xmath2 and has a very extended high - velocity tail reaching to 400 kms@xmath2 .",
    "these values are not incompatible with model predictions ; on the main sequence , the models show that even if the star starts out with a relatively flat internal rotation profile , the rotation becomes increasingly differential ( but never more than a factor of two in velocity ) because the convective core is contracting and therefore spinning up , while the outer layers are expanding and therefore slowing down . in spite of this , there is a global decrease in the rotation rate as a function of time as angular momentum is lost through mass - loss .",
    "so , depending on their age and their initial rotation rate , the observed velocities are quite acceptable .",
    "interestingly , @xcite notes that , in fact , the higher rotational velocities are generally associated with lower - mass stars .",
    "this is an important result .",
    "indeed @xcite predict that the rotation rates decrease more rapidly for higher initial rotation rates and for higher mass and therefore higher mass - loss rate stars , in view of the increased loss of angular momentum .",
    "this agrees very nicely with the observations .    for wr stars , very slow average surface rotation velocities in the range 2070 kms@xmath2",
    "are predicted for the he - burning phase , depending on the initial rotation velocity on the main sequence and on the evolutionary state of the star @xcite .",
    "the reason for these low values and the narrowness of this range is simple ; the amount of mass that must be removed from massive o stars to turn them into wr stars is so big that most of the angular momentum is lost in the process .",
    "however , the differential rotation that steadily increased on the main sequence suddenly becomes very pronounced , as the helium core contracts at the end of core hydrogen burning .",
    "the star ends up with a core spinning faster than the initial zams rotation velocity .",
    "a fast - spinning core , at least in some wr stars , would support the presently favoured model to explain long - soft gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "indeed , the so - called _ collapsar _ model @xcite involves the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star in its pre - supernova phase . in this model ,",
    "the central core becomes a black hole surrounded by a disk .",
    "the accretion of matter through the disk creates powerful jets in which the matter travels at very high speeds .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , have followed the evolution of a rotating he core to determine if the very rapid core velocities required by the collapsar model could be reached in spite of the many modes of transport and redistribution of the angular momentum taking place ( mass - loss , shear , turbulence , convection , etc ) .",
    "they found that indeed this is possible for initial rotation speeds on the main sequence that are typical of that of o stars .",
    "however , adding magnetic fields to the models has brought new elements to the problem .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that including magnetic torques caused by a spruit - tayler dynamo @xcite dramaticaly reduces the angular momentum of the core leading to periods in the resulting pulsar of 15 ms at birth , which is compatible with the average value for common pulsars but much too small to make a long - soft gamma - ray burst ( grb ) .    nevertheless , for a rotating star , efficient chemical mixing can occur and",
    "if the mixing timescale is shorter than the thermonuclear timescale , the star can remain quasi - chemically homogeneous @xcite . in that case",
    ", the star lacks the stratified layers which are required for the development of the spruit - tayler dynamo @xcite .",
    "this lack of a core - envelope structure prevents the magnetic core - envelope coupling described above and the spin - down of the star s core can be avoided . @xcite",
    "have shown that for a rapidly - rotating star on the main sequence and if the mass - loss in the wr phase is reduced by a factor of ten , massive - star evolution can indeed lead to a core with sufficient angular momentum to produce a long - soft grb .",
    "the necessary reduced mass - loss in the wr phase favors low metallicity environments for grbs . finally @xcite calculated evolutionary grids for massive stars including rotation and the effects of a spruit - tayler dynamo for different metalicities . still adopting wr mass - loss rates reduced by a factor of ten",
    ", they predict that the production of long grbs should be limited to metalicities smaller than @xmath3 0.004 .",
    "this translates into a peak at a redshift of z=4",
    ".    no reliable direct observation of wr rotation rates has ever been obtained .",
    "attempts have been made to estimate them based on the width of ( what the authors had assumed to be ) photospheric absorption lines in wr spectra @xcite , but these have been seriously questioned , as wind expansion and turbulence have not been taken into account .",
    "it may be virtually impossible to obtain the rotationnal velocity of wr stars directly through photospheric line - profiles but it could still be possible to deduce it from periodic variability in photometry or of spectral lines formed in the winds . indeed , the winds of massive stars have been demonstrated to be highly variable .",
    "in particular , one type of structure in the wind that accounts for some of these variations , co - rotating interaction regions ( cirs ) , are thought to be closely linked to the rotation of the star .",
    "indeed , these structures are caused by perturbations at the base of the wind that propagate through it and are carried by rotation .",
    "this generates a spiral - like structure in the density distribution , analogous to those commonly observed in the solar corona @xcite , which very likely leads to the ubiquitous discrete absorption components in the spectra of o stars @xcite .",
    "these are rarely observed in wr p  cygni profiles as their absorption components are usually saturated ( one exception is wr24 ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is believed that they also lead to a very characteristic , large - scale , periodic variability pattern in wr - wind emission lines . @xcite",
    "show the unambiguous s - shape pattern in time - series of model spectra of wr emission lines produced as a consequence of these variations .",
    "observational support has been obtained for this type of variability in two clear cases through repeated spectroscopic observations .",
    "wr6 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* p=3.76 days ) and wr134 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* p=2.25 days ) show periodic variations without any indication of a companion .",
    "the correspondence between the data and models is striking when one considers that optical depth effects , which are certainly occurring in the observed data , have not been included in the models .",
    "this brings strong support to the idea that cirs do in fact trace the * rotation rate * of the star at the base of the wind . according to @xcite ,",
    "these stars both have @xmath4 .",
    "this radius corresponds by definition to a rosseland optical depth of 20 .",
    "assuming that cirs form at this radius , the equatorial rotation speed ( at @xmath5 ) is @xmath1 40 km s@xmath2 for wr6 and @xmath1 70 km s@xmath2 for wr134 , not too different from values predicted by evolutionary models .",
    "the periods and variability patterns were found to be the same for lines formed at various distances in the wind , indicating that the cirs are governed by angular momentum conservation which results in a coherent structure in the wind .",
    "the period therefore provides a direct measurement of the rotation _",
    "rate _ of the underlying star . to calculate the rotation velocity we need to know at what radius the perturbation leading to the cir originates .",
    "if this radius is known , we can then calculate the rotation velocity _ at that radius_. much more observations and analysis of variability associated with cirs are required to reach this goal .",
    "therefore , the above velocities are only given as rough estimates for illustrative purposes .    in an attempt to identify more wr stars displaying cir - type variability ,",
    "we have carried out a survey of all galactic wr stars brighter than @xmath0 .",
    "our complete sample includes 39 southern stars , which will be discussed in @xcite , and 25 northern stars , which we discuss here .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present the different types of spectroscopic variability found in our magnitude - limited sample of stars in a qualitative but also quantitative manner .",
    "our aim is to use these characteristics to establish some guidelines to help identify the spectroscopic variations associated with cirs .",
    "once identified , these stars can then be observed more intensively and , if present , periods can be determined . in our second paper",
    ", we will build on these basis and use the complete sample to determine the frequency of the various types of line - profile variability .",
    "follow - up papers on individual stars that have been more intensively monitored are also planned .",
    "our northern sample includes all galactic wr stars visible from the mont mgantic observatory that are not confirmed as sb1 or sb2 binaries .",
    "our targets are listed in table  1 where the stars name , spectral type , ra , dec and @xmath6 are provided .",
    "when available , we also provide terminal velocities measured either from iue absorption troughs @xcite , from near - infrared line profiles @xcite or from optical line profiles @xcite .",
    "the last column indicates each star s variability status ( see below ) .",
    "note that although some stars in our sample have published spectral types that indicate a possible companion ( not indicated in the table ) , none have confirmed orbits . in the case of wr4 and wr128 ,",
    "only photometric variations have been found without radial velocity confirmation of binarity . in the case of wr131 , wr143 , wr156 and wr158",
    ", the claim of binarity is based solely on diluted emission lines ( d.e.l . ) and/or the presence of absorption lines in the spectrum ( + a ) . however , @xcite argue that binary status established from the d.e.l or + a criteria is often misleading as wr stars can produce a wide variety of spectra depending on their physical parameters .",
    "those authors have demonstrated that in many cases these types of spectra can be reproduced entirely with a single - star model . in particular , wr108 , wr156 and wr158 were among the stars that they reproduced with a single - star model .",
    "our final sample consists of 16 wn stars and 9 wc stars .",
    "we have included wr134 for comparison even though it is already known to show variability thought to be associated with cirs .",
    "however , we have excluded wr157 because it is too close on the sky to another star that is only @xmath11 magnitude fainter .",
    "the separation between the two stars is @xmath12.2@xmath7 , i.e. a value comparable with the average seeing at the mont mgantic observatory , where our data were obtained .",
    "it was therefore impossible to isolate the wr star in our 1.5@xmath7 spectrograph slit .",

    "of course , to quantify the changes and determine the period , a more thorough follow - up will subsequently be required .",
    "therefore , we set out to obtain 45 spectra per star in our sample .",

    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra ranges from 100 to 120 .    as our spectra",
    "are not photometrically calibrated , the final step of our data reduction procedure was to rectify the spectra .",
    "to do so , we have fitted a low order legendre polynomial to wavelength regions with no strong spectral lines and divided our spectra by the fitted curves .",
    "the final spectra are shown in the top panels of figures  [ fig1n ] to [ fig13n ] for the two strongest lines present in our wavelength interval .",

    "note that for wr4 , wr111 , wr5 and wr154 , we do not show the plot of the ciii@xmath104650 line because in those cases the line was on the extreme edge of the wavelength interval and therefore there was not enough continuum on one side of the line to allow for an accurate enough spectrum rectification .",
    "this could lead to a false detection of line variability .",
    "we prefer to adopt a conservative approach in this respect .    in order to search for significant spectroscopic variability among our targets",
    ", we have adopted the formalism of @xcite .",
    "first , we have calculated the temporal variance spectrum ( tvs ) , which is a statistically rigorous means of identifying the variable parts of our spectra . for @xmath11 spectra ,",
    "the tvs at wavelength @xmath12 is defined by : @xmath13 where the weights of the individual spectra , @xmath14 , are given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 a standardized dispersion . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the weighted mean spectrum , @xmath18 is the noise in the continuum and @xmath19 are wavelength correction factors given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the noise associated with the flux @xmath22 .",
    "then , we have established the level of significant variability assuming that our data are governed by a reduced chi - squared distribution with n@xmath231 degrees of freedom . using the standardized dipersion , @xmath24 , for scaling",
    ", we therefore adopt a threshold of : @xmath25 finally , we used @xmath26 to quantify the level of variability at each wavelength : a spectrum that reaches a level of 1 , is variable at a 1 @xmath27 level , if it reaches 3 it is variable at a 3 @xmath27 level , etc .",
    "we have chosen a confidence level of 99% , which means that if the value of @xmath28 reaches 3 , we are 99%  confident that the spectrum is variable at a 3 @xmath27 level .",
    "we note that as the standardized dispersion , @xmath24 is calculated using the noise level in the continuum regions and as the spectra are rectified , there is no real information on the variability of the continuum regions . in the bottom panels of figures  [ fig1n ] to [ fig13n ] ,",
    "we have plotted the @xmath29 spectrum for each star for easy comparison with the spectra plotted above .",
    "inspection of figures  [ fig1n ] to [ fig13n ] reveals that the majority of the stars in our sample show significant variability in at least one of the two main spectral lines in their spectrum .",
    "one notable exception is the wn2 star wr2 .",
    "for wr4 , wr5 , wr111 and wr154 , we did not detect variability in the weak civ line , but we only have limited information at our disposal since we do not have usable data in the strong ciii line .",
    "it is clear that the level of variability is quite different from one star to another .",
    "the variations range from a few @xmath27s to close to 60@xmath27s in wr115 .",
    "as the quality of our spectra is relatively uniform , we can , in principle , compare the @xmath27 from star to star , but its value only provides information on the significance of the changes with respect to the noise level of our data .",
    "as the line strengths are very different from star to star , comparing the significance level of the variations does not provide useful physical information .",
    "a quantity that is potentially more interesting is the fraction of the line flux that is variable . to characterize this ,",
    "it is best to use a quantity that is representative of the variance in pixel j compared to the noise at that wavelength ( @xmath30 ) rather than use a weight that is linked to the noise in the associated continuum , as the tvs does . to do this",
    ", @xcite has defined a modified tvs as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the reciprocal of the @xmath33 of the signal - to - noise ratio at pixel @xmath12 of the spectral line series .    in order to quantify what fraction of the line flux ( without the contiuum ) is variable",
    ", we divide this value by the line flux , @xmath34 .",
    "of course this quantity has no meaning outside emission lines and in particular in continuum regions . to avoid any problems ,",
    "we therefore limited our caculations to a width corresponding to a relative intensity level of 1.3 of each line . also , for very weak lines ( @xmath35 1.3 in relative intensity ) , our ratio becomes meaningless because the line flux , the denominator , is too close to zero and the variability level , the numerator , is dominated by the noise . in such cases ,",
    "we have left the panel blank . finally , absorption components of p  cygni profiles are also excluded since in that case the value of @xmath34 will be negative and can not be compared directly with what is observed in emission lines .",
    "the values of @xmath36 are plotted in the middle panels of figures  [ fig1n ] to [ fig13n ] .",
    "several interesting conclusions can be drawn from these plots .",
    "first , for all types of stars , both lines show roughly the same level of variability .",
    "however , one has to note that in the case of wn stars , we compared lines of the same ion and therefore it is likely that in a given star , these two lines are formed in similar regions of the wind .",
    "the line widths are indeed , in most cases , very similar .",
    "another interesting feature of the variability is that the calculated values of @xmath37 are much stronger in p  cygni absorption components than in the corresponding emission components , i.e. the variations are more significant .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since that part of the profile comes from a much smaller volume of the wind than the emission and therefore suffers less from cancelling effects from large - scale changes in density or ionisation arising in different parts of the wind .",
    "this effect is clearly present in the p  cygni profile of wr123 ( heii@xmath104686 ) or wr119 ( ciii@xmath104650 ) , for example .    after a careful examination of figures [ fig1n ] to [ fig13n ]",
    ", we divide our sample in three main categories : stars showing no profile variability ( nv ) , stars showing small - scale profile variability ( ssv  @xmath38 ) and stars showing large - scale variability ( lsv  @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that the stars designated as nv are not necessarily stars that do not show spectral variability , but rather that no significant variability can be detected at a level of confidence of 99% on spectra having signal - to - noise ratio @xmath1100 .",
    "our conclusions are listed in the last column of table  1 .",
    "the detected subpeaks have widths that range from @xmath1140 kms@xmath2 for the smallest isolated structures to @xmath1350 kms@xmath2 for the largest .",
    "unfortunately , our limited dataset does not allow us to search for correlations between these widths and , for example , the level of variability or the width of the global line . in the following sections we will discuss in turn the variability we found in wn and wc stars .",
    "significant variability has been found in all but one wn star in our sample , i.e. wr2 , the wn star of the earliest type .",
    "however , this seems to be an unusual wr star .",
    "@xcite note that this star has unique line - profile shapes .",
    "these authors were unable to reproduce its spectrum using their model atmospheres without convolving the normal wind lines with a rotation profile with a velocity of 1900 km s@xmath2 , which is very close to the star s critical velocity .",
    "this is , of course , a simplistic way of including the effects of rotation on the line profile and is likely to lead to improbable conclusions but it reflects the fact that the line - formation process for this star is not totally understood and that the star is unusual in that respect .    for wr3 , wr152 , wr128 , wr136 , wr131 , wr158 and wr108 ,",
    "variability has indeed been detected but at a relatively low level of @xmath40 of the line flux .",
    "the nature of the changes is also very different from the cir - type variability we first set - out to identify .",
    "the structures are small and are most likely stochastic changes associated with inhomogeneities in the wind of wr stars , such as discussed from an observational point of view by @xcite and @xcite , for example .",
    "more recently , there have been some insightful theoretical investigations into small - scale inhomogeneities in the winds of hot stars .",
    "@xcite present radiation hydrodynamic simulations of hot - star winds line - profile variations that arise as a consequence of the intrinsically unstable nature of the line - driving mechanism of the wind .",
    "those calculations show , for example , that including rayleigh - taylor or thin - shell instablities together with some lateral averaging of the diffuse radiation is important to understand the behaviour of the width of the subpeaks as a function of their position on the line profile , i.e. the lateral versus radial size of the small scale inhomogeneities in the wind .",
    "we believe that the characteristics of the variations seen in the stars that we classify as ssv , are compatible with the type of changes caused by such small - scale inhomegeneities in the wind .    for wr1 , wr110 , wr115 , wr134 , wr120 , wr123 , wr124 and wr156 , the variations have a much larger amplitude . therefore , it is quite likely that the physical phenomenon from which they originate is different from what is observed for ssv stars .",
    "we discuss these stars in more detail below .",
    "wr134 is well - known to show cir - type variability for which a period of 2.3 days has been identified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use it as a test that indeed with 45 spectra we can identify easily the type of variability we are looking for .",
    "one can clearly see on top of both the heii@xmath104686 and heii@xmath104860 lines , broad emission excesses at different positions on the line .",
    "the changes are highly significant and reach @xmath27  =  68 %  of the line flux .",
    "three other wn stars show a similar type of variability : wr1 , wr115 and wr120 .",
    "these stars clearly show cir - type variations ; large - scale structures are seen superposed on the broad emission lines reaching @xmath4178%  of the line flux in wr1 and wr120 and @xmath4110@xmath2312%  of the line flux in wr115 .",
    "we therefore classify these stars as lsv and further put them in the cir - type category .",
    "the situation is less clear for wr110 .",
    "clear structures can be distinguished on both spectral lines .",
    "the variations reach a level of @xmath415%  of the line flux , which is significantly higher than the other stars we have classified as ssv and that we associate with small - scale wind inhomogeneities .",
    "however , the detected structures are not quite as strong as for those showing variability thought to be associated with cirs .",
    "therefore , we classify this star as a ssv and use it to establish our approximate upper limit for the level of small - scale / blob - like variability .    finally , for wr123 , wr124 and wr156 , all wn8-type stars , a different type of variability is found .",
    "the changes reach a relatively high level ( from 5 to 10% of the line flux ) but appear to be different in nature from those thought to be associated with cirs .",
    "the @xmath27 profile has a very typical shape with two maxima , one on the red and the other on the blue side of the emission line and a minimum at line center .",
    "the only exception is the heii@xmath104686 profile of wr123 but in that case there is a very strong contrast between the variability in the absorption component and that of the emission .",
    "in fact this effect of a more variable absorption component seems to be amplified in wr108 , the only wn9 star in our sample . indeed , despite the fact that we have classified this star as ssv , the changes are different in nature from that observed in the other stars we have put in that category . in this case",
    ", the variability is actually confined to the p  cygni absorption component of the heii@xmath104860 line , which is clearly present . in view of the specific nature of the changes ,",
    "we create a separate class of lsv for wn8-type stars . actually , wn8 stars are well - known to display an unusual behaviour .",
    "@xcite presented a comprehensive study of the photometric and spectroscopic variability patterns of 10 galactic wn8 stars and found a link between the level of variability in the continuum and in spectral lines which they suggest may be linked to pulsational instabilities .",
    "other unusual behaviours of wn8 stars as summarized by @xcite include a low binary frequency , a high distance from the galactic plane and/or runaway speeds and the fact that they are rarely found in stellar clusters and associations .",
    "therefore , it is perhaps not surprising to find that they fall in a class of their own compared with other types of wr stars when it comes to spectral variability .",
    "because of problems with our spectrum rectification procedure of the ciii@xmath104650 lines in our early - type wc stars , the information at our disposal for these stars is more limited than for wn stars .",
    "indeed , this line is located very close to the blue extremity of our wavelength interval .",
    "therefore , the continuum regions that are available bluewards of the line are much more restricted .",
    "this reduces the accuracy that can be achieved during the spectrum rectification procedure .",
    "of course , the higher the contrast of the line with respect to the continuum , the more it is affected by this effect .",
    "the wc4 star wr143 has a somewhat weaker ciii line than the other early wc stars and therefore we were able to obtain a sufficiently accurate rectified line profile .",
    "note that this line is slightly affected by blending with the neighbouring heii@xmath104686 line .",
    "this is the reason why the line rises towards the red .",
    "however , the civ@xmath105016 line in that star is practically inexistent .",
    "we classify this star as ssv as its variability level is @xmath42 of the line flux .    for wr4 , wr111 , wr5 and wr154 , all wc5 and wc6 stars ,",
    "no variability is detected in the weak civ@xmath105016 line , which is the only usable line in our wavelength range .",
    "we therefore classify them as stars showing no profile variabilities ( nv ) but note that new observations of a stronger line should be obtained to verify this assertion .    for wr135 , we find small - scale variability only in the ciii@xmath104650 line .",
    "the civ@xmath105016 line is constant at the level of accuracy of our dataset .",
    "this star has been clearly identified as a typical , small - scale variable by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we reach the same conclusion here ; we classify it as a ssv .",
    "finally , the three wc9d stars , wr106 , wr119 and wr121 , all reach a high level of variability .",
    "however , as indicated by their spectral types , these wc stars are thought to produce carbon - based dust in their atmosphere .",
    "some wc dust makers have been shown to be binaries ( e.g. the well - known system wr140 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case",
    ", it is believed that the dust is produced within the cone - shaped shock formed as a consequence of the collision between the two stellar winds . as the gas flows along the shock cone ,",
    "it eventually reaches distances where the density compression is still adequate for dust formation and the intensity of the ultraviolet flux from the star is sufficiently low not to destroy it . for single stars , however , a definite mechanism to form dust in the wind has yet not been identified .",
    "shocks within the wind itself caused by radiative instabilities have been claimed to be possible sources @xcite .",
    "since all three of our wc9d stars are variable with a large amplitude , we believe that caution must be used , since colliding - wind binaries have been shown to display line - profile variability in the optical with characteristics very similar to that of cirs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore possible that the wc9d stars in our sample are yet un - identified binaries .",
    "we plan to investigate this further by carrying out intensive spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaigns of these stars .",
    "only a detailed study can reveal if the changes are due to a colliding - wind shock - cone or to cirs .",
    "therefore , we classify these stars as lsv but create a separate class , the wc - late dust makers .",
    "the results of our search for optical spectroscopic variability among presumably single wr stars can be summarised as follows . for eight stars , wr3 , wr152 , wr128 , wr136 , wr131 , wr158 , wr108 and wr135 ,",
    "variability was found but at a small level compared to the flux of the line .",
    "this type of variability is most - likely associated with inhomogeneities in the dense wr wind , which move with it and reveal themselves as small - scale structures superposed on the broad emission lines . in more detailed studies , they have been found to move from line center to the edges of the lines as described for example by @xcite and @xcite . as the driving mechanism for these radiatively - driven winds has been found to be inherently unstable @xcite , such variability is expected for all wr stars .",
    "nevertheless , for 5 other stars in our sample , namely wr2 , wr4 , wr111 , wr5 , wr154 we found no significant line - profile variability .",
    "note however that in the last 4 cases , our conclusion is based solely on a single relatively weak line .",
    "in fact , wr111 , is a star that is known to display small - scale spectral variability due to the presence of inhomogeneities in its wind and has been studied by @xcite . in any case , identifying a star as non - variable always depends on the quality of the data in hand . down to",
    "what level of accuracy these stars are constant is , indeed , an important question .",
    "one would like to verify if _ all _ wr stars have inhomogeneities in their winds , if some stars present a different level of variability and if so , what is the cause of this difference .",
    "this kind of information can help us better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for these unstable outflows .",
    "nine stars in our sample presented large - scale profile variability .",
    "of these , we have identified three new candidates for cir - type variability : wr1 , wr115 and wr120 .",
    "follow - up observations with a high temporal resolution will be required to determine if these changes are periodic and if so identify the period .",
    "we have done so already for wr1 and present our results in an upcoming paper @xcite .",
    "although the results presented here are not yet for our complete sample , it is interesting to compare our findings to what is known for ob stars .",
    "although the presence of dacs in o - star p cygni profiles is found to be common ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cyclical variability in emission lines is not found to show the same ubiquitous behavior .",
    "@xcite present a long - term monitoring campaign of the h@xmath43 line of 22 bright ob supergiants .",
    "variability was found in all cases with two possible origins : either the underlying photospheric profile and/or a wind component .",
    "cyclical changes which very likely originate from large - scale structures in the wind were found for only two stars in their sample ( @xmath1 14%  of the stars ) . in this study",
    "we have identified 4 cir - type variables ( 3 of which are new ) out of a sample of 25 , or @xmath1 16% , a very similar fraction .",
    "alternatively , we can exclude the wn  8 and wc  9 stars from this estimate ; if we do so we also obtain a similar fraction , 4/19@xmath121% .",
    "this striking difference between variability in p  cygni absorption components and emission lines is most likely due to the fact in the former we are sampling a much more physically restricted volume of the wind ( i.e. that in front of the star ) compared to the entire wind which can be subject to cancelling effects in parts of the wind which are physically distinct but that are travelling at a similar projected velocity .",
    "in addition to the stars showing variability thougt to be associated with cirs , we have defined two distinct classes of lsv : wn8 stars which are already known to be a peculiar class of wr stars and wc9d stars . in the latter case , it remains to be checked if the changes originate in the wind of a single star because of the presence of cirs or if these stars are in fact colliding - wind binaries .",
    "if of binary origin , a very similar variability pattern is expected with some differences that can be identified with a detailed monitoring campaign .",
    "for example , strong epoch - dependancy in spite of the presence of periodic changes would suggest a single - star origin . also , shock - cones translate into a very distinct and easily recognisable variability pattern on spectral lines , translating to at most , two large excess emissions moving around periodically on the emission line .    although our survey has revealed a relatively small fraction ( @xmath112% ) of stars showing line - profile variability thought to be associated with cirs among wr stars , it still provides some new candidates for potential estimates of wr rotation velocities .",
    "it also provides us with the opportunity to study in more detail the cir phenomenon for which still very little is known by providing a larger pool of candidates to observe .",
    "it is clear that better observational constraints of this phenomenon are crucial to reach a greater understanding of the physical mecanisms from which they originate .",
    "we wish to thank g. skalkowsky , c. foellmi and g. caron for participating in observing campaigns in 2001/2002 .",
    "we are also grateful to the ( anonymous ) referee for comments that led to an improvement of the quality of this paper .",
    "finally , we would like to thank the national sciences and engineering research council ( nserc ) of canada for financial support .",
