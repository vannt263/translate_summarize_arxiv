    "in ref .  @xcite , detailed study have been presented to predict the transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) spectrum of the higgs boson ( @xmath2 ) following an effective field theory approach , where two additional real scalars @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been introduced to the standard model ( sm ) lagrangian .",
    "the main process of study is @xmath10 , where @xmath1 is assumed to be a dark matter ( dm ) candidate - a source of missing energy ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the study follows from the results comprised of the measurements of the differential higgs boson transverse momentum , double higgs boson resonance searches , associated higgs boson production with top quarks , and @xmath12 resonances ( where @xmath13 ) .",
    "an efficient @xmath14 analysis has been performed in this study to constraint and fit the model parameters with respect to known experimental results . in conclusion",
    "the analysis fits the mass of the hypothetical real scalar boson , @xmath0 , to be @xmath15  gev whereas the mass of @xmath1 is predicted around @xmath16  gev .    in this study",
    "we take an opportunity to pick one of the benchmark scenarios from the above studies , where @xmath4 gev and @xmath5 gev , to analyse the associated production of the higgs boson with a single and a pair of top quarks .",
    "section  [ hprod ] deals briefly with the production modes of the higgs boson at hadron colliders",
    ". the associated production of the higgs with top quarks in the sm and beyond the sm , such as our additional scalars , are detailed in section  [ htop ] , and in section  [ summ ] we summarise our studies with concluding remarks .",
    "at hadron colliders , like the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the higgs boson production can be achieved via three main channels .",
    "taking the descending order of magnitude of production cross sections , the modes are ( 1 ) gluon - gluon fusion through top - quarks in one - loop diagrams , ( 2 ) vector - boson fusion through @xmath17 and z - bosons and ( 3 ) in association with a pair of top - quarks and with a single top - quark .",
    "it is also known that the @xmath18 final state is the dominant decay mode in the sm for @xmath19  gev , though has not yet been observed .",
    "the search for this decay mode is already precluded with overwhelming multijet backgrounds in the gluon fusion process ( 1 ) , but the signal to background ratio for this decay mode can be improved via the modes ( 2 ) and ( 3 )  @xcite .",
    "here we only focus on process ( 3 ) for our studies , which is advantageous for the direct measurement of top - yukawa couplings , @xmath20 . since @xmath20 is close to unity ( due to the large measured mass of the top quark )",
    ", it may also gain insight into the scale of new physics .",
    "this motivates our work on this production mode , not only in association with the @xmath2 , but also with the comparatively heavy @xmath0 as discussed in the introduction .",
    "before discussing our analyses for the top - quark associated @xmath2 and @xmath0 productions in detail , let us review the effective field theory - `` a bottom - up '' approach introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the scalars @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    for all numerical analyses",
    "the codes are written in ` mathematica ` , ` c^{++ } ` , ` python ` , models are generated with ` feynrules ` which are further used for event generation through ` madgraph5 ` .",
    "events are then showered and hadronized using ` pythia 8.2 ` , plotting and analyses followed through the ` rivet ` package .",
    "considering two hypothetical real scalars , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , an effective lagrangian can be written with the following terms in addition to the sm lagrangian : @xmath21,\\\\   \\mathcal{l}_{\\text{t } } & = -\\frac{1}{2}~v\\big[\\lambda_{_{hhh}}hhh + \\lambda_{_{h\\chi\\chi}}h\\chi\\chi + \\lambda_{_{h\\chi\\chi}}h\\chi\\chi\\big ] , \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{l}_{\\text{q } } & = -\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{_{hh\\chi\\chi}}hh\\chi\\chi - \\frac{1}{4 } \\lambda_{_{hhhh}}hhhh   -\\frac{1}{4}\\lambda_{_{hh\\chi\\chi}}hh \\chi\\chi -\\frac{1}{4 } \\lambda_{_{hh\\chi\\chi}}hh\\chi\\chi , \\label{vq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the scale factor with respect to the sm yukawa top coupling , @xmath23 , and used to tune the effective @xmath24 coupling ( as @xmath25 is used for @xmath26 couplings ) .",
    "this formalism considers @xmath0 production through the effective @xmath24 vertex , which further decays into @xmath2 with @xmath1 .",
    "the symmetry of the above lagrangian follows from @xmath1 being stable and treated as a dm candidate . for constraints on couplings , masses etc . , we followed ref .",
    "@xcite and selected a particular benchmark scenario where @xmath4 gev and @xmath5 gev for all analyses .",
    ".cross sections in pb for the mentioned processes are calculated with @xmath27 gev , @xmath19 gev , @xmath4 gev and @xmath5 gev at @xmath28 tev using ` cteq6l1 ` pdf sets .",
    "the renormalisation and factorisation scales for @xmath29 is taken to be @xmath30 , while for @xmath31 , @xmath32 . [",

    "thereafter special selection cuts are described in table  [ all ] with number of events for the processes shown in table  [ cs ] .",
    "different differential distributions corresponding to these analyses are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : b ] and  [ fig : c ] after preselection criteria . for these analyses",
    "we have defined @xmath38 as the scalar sum of jet and lepton transverse momenta : @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath11 distributions show an excess of events for @xmath40 in comparison to the sm processes , since @xmath1 is the source of missing energy which was also discussed in the analyses ` a.1 ` . some excesses in the @xmath38 distributions , similar to @xmath11 ,",
    "is observed as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : c ] , where the distributions are obtained for a particular requirements on the number of @xmath7-tagged jets in total events . the distributions in figs .",

    "[ fig : c ] ( b ) , ( e ) requires two @xmath7-tagged jets and figs .  [",
    "fig : c ] ( c ) , ( f ) requires more than two @xmath7-tagged jets among total events .    in table",
    "[ all ] different selection stages can be read after the horizontal line .",
    "the first block are all the preselection criteria ( from ( 1)-(4 ) ) , and then after each block ( separated with a horizontal lines and numbered appropriately from ( 5)-(13 ) ) follows a special selection in addition to the preselections of events . comparing ` p.13 ` and ` p.24 ` , which is basically the sm versus @xmath40 process in last column of table  [ all ] , gives an idea of the number of events in both cases after each selection .",
    "in a few selection choices the sm events are more than those beyond the sm , but in most of the cases beyond the sm events are higher than the sm events .",
    "these analyses show how a heavy scalar @xmath0 production can be observed in experiments following the decay @xmath40 in top - quark associated higgs boson productions at the lhc with @xmath3  tev .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we discussed an effective field theory approach to add two real scalars @xmath0 and @xmath1 in addition to the sm lagrangian . choosing one benchmark point from this analysis , we studied the associated higgs boson production with a single top - quark and a pair of top - quarks in the sm , as well as beyond the sm , in particular @xmath40 at the lhc with @xmath3  tev , @xmath4  gev and @xmath5  gev .    with two distinct stages of analysis , we studied these processes in detail with single lepton and same - sign lepton , @xmath41 or @xmath42 di - lepton events .",
    "the study follows through analysing differential distributions of kinematics and then counting the number of events with special selection criteria on said events .",
    "a comparative study for the sm and beyond the sm processes shows how the events for associated higgs production with top - quarks can be observed at the lhc with @xmath3  tev .",
    "any excesses in the events at the lhc for the processes studied here , may be explained with the effective model approach discussed with the introduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where in particular @xmath0 decays to @xmath43 .",
    "this study also leads to open a discussions of any possible new physics contributions for top - yukawa couplings .",
