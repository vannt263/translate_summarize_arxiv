    "the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) has been used extensively for the generation of entangled photon pairs in many recent experiments .",
    "the purpose of these experiments range from bell s inequality violation @xcite to the implementation of quantum information protocols @xcite . in the process of spdc",
    ", a laser pump beam photon interacts with second - order nonlinear @xmath0 crystal , gets annihilated and gives rise to the emission of two photons .",
    "these two photons are generated simultaneously and follow the laws of energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the phenomena of spdc was first observed by burnham and weinberg @xcite and theoretically studied by hong ou and mandel @xcite .",
    "the photon pairs generated through spdc are entangled in the spatial degrees of freedom i.e. position - momentum entanglement @xcite as well as entanglement in orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite .",
    "this oam entanglement can be described by a multi - dimensional hilbert space @xcite , compared to the case of polarization entanglement which is limited to two dimensions only @xcite .",
    "these photon pairs have been found to be entangled in time - bin also @xcite .",
    "optical vortices ( ov ) carry a dark core in a bright background @xcite .",
    "if there is a phase change of @xmath1 around the point of darkness , it is called a vortex of topological charge @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is an integer .",
    "the sense of rotation determines the sign of topological charge of the vortex .",
    "a beam with such a phase structure has a helical wavefront and , therefore , carries an oam of @xmath3 per photon @xcite for a vortex of topological charge @xmath2 .",
    "these beams have found a variety of applications , such as optical trapping of atoms @xcite , optical tweezing and spanning @xcite , optical communication @xcite , imaging @xcite , and quantum information and computation @xcite .    for any application of entangled photons generated through the spdc ,",
    "it is important to know the spatial distribution of photons arising from the spdc process . for the gaussian pump beam ,",
    "the spatial distribution of spdc photons has already been reported @xcite . however , for photons generated by pumping with higher order vortices , it has not been reported so far .",
    "although , the phase - matching by optical vortex pump beam h as been studied theoretically by pittman et.al . @xcite .    with the availability of low noise and high quantum - efficiency electron - multiplying ccds ( emccd )",
    ", the experiments with low photon level imaging has become possible @xcite . to observe the shape of the spdc ring formed by the gaussian as well as optical vortex beams , we have carried out experimental studies using emccd .",
    "the observed experimental results are supported with our numerical results .",

    "the intensity distribution of an optical vortex of order @xmath2 can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the beam radius of host beam , @xmath6 is the maximum intensity in the bright ring .",
    "clearly , eq . [ eq : gaussian ] shows that the gaussian beam is a special case of optical vortex with @xmath7 .",
    "the nonlinear effects in crystals have been exploited in a number of applications such as frequency doubling , optical parametric oscillation and the spdc @xcite . when a nonlinear crystal , for example beta - barium borate ( bbo ) , with non - zero second order electric susceptibility ( @xmath0 ) is pumped by an intense laser , a _ pump _ photon ( frequency @xmath8 and wave - vector @xmath9 ) splits into a photon pair called _ signal _ and _ idler_. the energy and momentum conservation",
    "provide us with @xmath10 where suffices @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote signal and idler photons respectively .",
    "the phase matching is determined by the frequency of pump laser beam , and the orientation of crystal optic axis with respect to the pump .",

    "@xmath30 denotes the crystal optic axis .",
    "the angular separation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is due to energy and phase - matching conditions ( eq . [ eq : momentum1 ] and [ eq : momentum2 ] ) required for the spdc process .",

    "the stream of single photons passing through the chosen point generates spdc rings",
    "whose radius depends on the distance between crystal and emccd .",
    "the intensity of the rings are proportional to the intensity at the selected point .",
    "the rings corresponding to signal and idler photons are then added to obtain the spdc ring for the pump photons . in the similar way ,",

    "the astigmatism of the diode laser ( rgblase 405 nm , 50 mw ) have been removed by using a combination of lenses . the collimated beam is then sent to a spatial light modulator ( slm ) ( hamamatsu lcos slm x-10468 - 05 ) , which is interfaced with computer ( pc1 ) .",

    "bbo crystal ( 6@xmath356@xmath355 mm@xmath36 ) with optic axis at 29.7@xmath32 is used for the parametric down - conversion . as",
    "the size of ov beams of higher order becomes bigger than the size of the crystal , we have used a lens l1 ( @xmath37=15 cm ) to loosely focus the vortex beam on the crystal .",
    "the bbo crystal is mounted on a rotation stage , so that phase - matching angle can be achieved by rotating the crystal along its optic axis . after achieving phase - matching ,",
    "the crystal remains unaltered for all the observations .",
    "when phase - matched , the output cone makes half angle of @xmath38 with pump direction @xmath20 .",
    "the bbo crystal is kept in such a way that it can down - convert only vertically polarized light .",
    "therefore , when angle of the hwp is 0@xmath39 ( 45@xmath39 ) , then we will get ( not get ) down - converted photons . image of the down - converted ring is recorded by andor ixon@xmath40 emccd camera using an imaging lens of focal length 5 cm .",

    "this could not be subtracted while subtracting the background due to shift in its position during the rotation of hwp from 45@xmath32 to 0@xmath32 .",
    "the interference filters if1 and if2 pass only the down - converted photons of wave - length 810@xmath345 nm and block the pump photons of wave - length 405 nm .",
    "two interference filters have been used to reduce the pump photons as much as possible .",
    "the power of 405 nm laser falling on the bbo crystal was 2 mw .",
    "emccd was operated at -80@xmath32c .",
    "further , we have taken images by accumulating 50 frames exposure time of 1 s. we have used the complete 512@xmath35512 pixels of the camera .",
    "the readout rate was set at 1 mhz 16-bit .",
    "since the observed spdc rings were sufficiently intense , we have not enabled the electron - multiplication gain .",

    "the gaussian beam is generated using the slm by transferring the blazed grating hologram of topological charge 0 to the slm . to vary the width of the gaussian beam , we have used the beam at different propagation distances from the slm ( 150 cm to 350 cm in the steps of 50 cms ) . as the size of beam was lower than the aperture of the crystal at 350 cm from the slm ,",
