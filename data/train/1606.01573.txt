    "turbulence and in particular plasma turbulence is still one of the least understood phenomena in classical physics today .",
    "even though there are advances in theory many processes can not be fully explained yet due to their strong nonlinearity .",
    "these cover many different scales and include experiments on earth @xcite as well as a wide variety of processes ( e.g. magnetic reconnection @xcite and turbulent dynamos@xcite ) and astrophysical phenomena such as stellar winds @xcite and magnetized accretion disks @xcite .",
    "compressibility also plays an important role in astrophysical plasmas and increases the complexity even further .",
    "in addition to theory , experiments and observations , numerical simulations are a useful tool to understand turbulence .",
    "however , the level of detail is restricted by the available computing power and realistic ( physical ) dynamical ranges are usually not covered .",
    "fortunately , this problem can be improved with the help of large eddy simulations ( les)@xcite .",
    "this approach simulates only the largest and intermediate scales directly .",
    "the smallest scales , which are below the resolution limit , i.e. below the grid scale , are introduced by means of a subgrid - scale ( sgs ) model .",
    "formally , the procedure involves the convolution of the primary equations with a filter kernel @xmath4 . for a static , homogeneous and isotropic filter the compressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations under boundary conditions read@xcite @xmath5 filtering",
    "is denoted by @xmath6 and mass - weighted filtering @xcite is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "thus , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( incorporating @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 are the filtered density , velocity , magnetic field and thermal pressure , respectively . in the context of les filtered quantities are considered resolved and therefore accessible in the simulation .",
    "non - ideal effects are included via resistivity @xmath13 and kinematic viscosity @xmath14 with traceless kinetic rate - of - strain tensor @xmath15 . here",
    ", @xmath16 designates the @xmath17-th partial derivative of component @xmath18 , a star @xmath19 indicates the traceless , deviatoric part of a tensor , and einstein summation convention applies with the kronecker delta @xmath20 .",
    "two new terms enter the equations and .",
    "the first term , modified from its hydrodynamical form , is the turbulent stress tensor @xmath21 which consists of the turbulent ( or sgs ) magnetic pressure ( last term in ) , the sgs reynolds stress @xmath22 and the sgs maxwell stress @xmath23 .",
    "the second term is the turbulent electromotive force ( emf ) @xmath24 in the induction equation .",
    "both terms are _ a priori_unknown as only filtered primary quantities are accessible in les ( e.g. @xmath9 ) but no mixed terms ( e.g. @xmath25 ) .",
    "moreover , the total filtered energy density @xmath26 contains unclosed terms as well , namely the kinetic sgs energy @xmath27 and magnetic sgs energy @xmath28 .",
    "these terms are given by the isotropic parts of the turbulent stress tensors @xmath29 similarly , the filtering procedure applies to other quantities such as the cross - helicity @xmath30  a measure of the alignment between velocity and magnetic field .",
    "the resulting sgs cross - helicity @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 it encodes not only the alignment between unresolved fields , but also between resolved and unresolved ones .",
    "on the one hand , there has been a lot of research in the realm of ( incompressible ) hydrodynamics@xcite with successful applications to atmospheric boundary layers@xcite and turbulent mixing @xcite , as well as astrophysical application@xcite in different subjects such as isolated disc galaxies@xcite or the formation of supermassive black holes@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "results for mhd are still scarce and limited to _ a posteriori _ application of ( decaying ) turbulent boxes@xcite in either 2d@xcite , or in the incompressible case@xcite , or by neglecting terms such as turbulent magnetic pressure@xcite . however , the _ a priori_validation of these closures is still outstanding , apart from a single incompressible dataset for the emf@xcite .",
    "for this reason , we here expand our first investigation of nonlinear closures@xcite with additional closures from the literature , and over a more extended set of parameters and test cases .",
    "we have identified several closure strategies developed in the literature and evaluate the three major ones : eddy - viscosity , which is typically purely dissipative , scale - similarity , which is based on the self - similar properties of turbulence , and deconvolution closures , which are fundamentally nonlinear based on approximate inverses of the filtering operator .",
    "all closures , including the new nonlinear closures , are briefly presented in the next section . a detailed derivation and formal analysis of the new closures",
    "is described in our accompanying paper@xcite . in section  [ sec : verification ] we describe our test setup and the process of _ a priori_testing for several reference quantities .",
    "the results are then illustrated in section  [ sec : results ] and include a wide variety of functional and structural tests .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude with an overall comparison of the presented closures .",
    "the following independent terms require closures : the sgs reynolds stress @xmath33 , the sgs maxwell stress @xmath34 and the electromotive force @xmath35 . in the following",
    ", we briefly present three general closure strategies ( eddy - viscosity , scale - similarity and nonlinear ) and possible variations with respect to normalization .",
    "each closure strategy is based on a certain idea that naturally transfers to closures of all unknown terms .",
    "we identify closures by two uppercase roman letters ( with normalizations in superscript ) , and closure expressions in formulas are denoted by a hat @xmath36 .",
    "[ [ the - eddy - dissipation ] ] the eddy - dissipation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    family is the most well - established type of closure originating from the smagorinsky eddy - viscosity@xcite going back several decades . in general , the modeled effects are purely dissipative in nature and resemble existing terms , e.g. the reynolds stress   has the same functional form as the microscopic dissipation in the momentum equation , c.f .",
    "the right hand side of .",
    "the same is true for the emf   and ohmic dissipation in the induction equation . an eddy - diffusivity based closure for the maxwell stress has been proposed@xcite analogous to eddy - viscosity . the resulting closures are @xmath37 with eddy - viscosity ( @xmath38)@xmath39 , diffusivity ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41 , resistivity ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 , and resolved current @xmath44 . the kinetic rate - of - strain tensor @xmath45 and magnetic rate - of - strain tensor @xmath46 are by construction deviatoric and so are the closures and .",
    "the remaining isotropic parts are closed by means of sgs energy closures @xmath47 which can be derived from and building upon the realizability of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for a positive filter kernel@xcite .",
    "the free coefficients @xmath50 appear independently in every closure ( including all following ones ) and are typically dimensionless .",
    "one goal of _ a priori_testing is the determination of the coefficient values as described in subsection [ ss : refquant ] .",
    "in addition to the realizability ansatz , the isotropic parts can be closed under the assumption of local equilibrium between production and dissipation in the sgs energy evolution equations@xcite resulting in @xmath51    furthermore , several normalizations ( or scalings ) have been developed to control the strength of the deviatoric closures based on different arguments . in this paper , we test the most often used ones , i.e. constant scaling , scaling by sgs energy , and scaling by the interaction between the velocity and the magnetic field .",
    "constant scaling is given by @xmath52 motivated by dimensional analysis under kolmogorov scaling@xcite .",
    "these closures neglect any local variability of the eddy - viscosity , diffusivity and resistivity .",
    "in contrast to this , sgs energies , as a local measure of unresolved turbulence , can be used as a proxy to obtain spatially varying closures @xmath53 however , the exact values for the energies @xmath27 and @xmath28 are unknown .",
    "thus , the energy closure expressions can be used to formulate complete closures@xcite based only on known fields @xmath54 another possibility to include local variability is via the interactions between velocity and magnetic field .",
    "here , the sgs cross - helicity serves as a proxy in the closures @xmath55 with a turbulent time scale @xmath56 .",
    "again , an alternative formulation has been proposed@xcite @xmath57 since is unclosed .",
    "@xmath58 is the resolved vorticity .",
    "the closures are motivated by assuming that the modeled cross - helicity dissipation rate is a robust proxy of transfer between kinetic and magnetic energy .",
    "in addition , we include the @xmath59-closure@xcite for the electromotive force @xmath60 in our comparison which was recently applied in les of current sheets@xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath61 is closed identically to @xmath62 , @xmath63 is linked to the sgs cross - helicity and @xmath64 is connected to the residual helicity @xmath65 .    [ [ scale - similarity ] ] scale - similarity + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    ( @xmath66 ) closures are characterized by the assumption that the tensorial structure at the smallest resolved scales is similar to the one at the largest unresolved scales@xcite .",
    "this motivates the introduction of a second filter ( a test filter ) with a filter width equal to or larger than the original filter width .",
    "the result of the second filter operation is analogous to the result of the first filter operation and this allows the recovery of the subgrid - scales .",
    "we use a filter with twice the original filter width , as proposed based on experimental data@xcite , and denote this operation by @xmath67 .",
    "it is understood that mass - weighted filtering is applied to all quantities involving @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting closures are @xmath68 it should be noted that these coefficients are introduced in order to allow for deviation from model assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , they are expected to be approximately @xmath69 due to the self - similarity assumption .",
    "in addition to this , closures for the sgs energies can be extracted from these terms directly by means of definition , i.e. @xmath70    [ [ nonlinear ] ] nonlinear + + + + + + + + +    ( @xmath71 ) closures are structural in nature .",
    "while they are related to other gradient ( also tensor - diffusivity ) closures@xcite , they are not based on the expansion of the primary quantities , but can be derived through gradient expansion of the filter kernel@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the other two families , the assumptions here are rooted in the properties of the filtering operator and not of turbulence as such . truncating the expansion at first order and neglecting the commutator between mass - weighted filtering and differentiation lead to the following expressions@xcite : @xmath72 the electromotive force closure",
    "is proposed in our accompanying paper for the first time .",
    "it goes beyond the previously proposed expression@xcite @xmath73 by explicitly capturing compressible effects in the second term . as for the scale - similarity closures , the coefficients are external to the closures and meant to capture errors not in - line with the closure assumptions",
    "thus , values around @xmath69 are expected .",
    "again , closures for the sgs energies can readily be written down by definition   as @xmath74 a normalized version of the nonlinear sgs stress tensors has been proposed in the hd@xcite case and in our previous work@xcite for mhd : @xmath75 effectively , the strength is locally determined by the sgs energy and the structural information is extracted from the unnormalized closures @xmath76 and @xmath77 . like the energy - scaled closures within the eddy - dissipation family , and are not closed .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be replaced by the energy closure resulting in @xmath78",
    "in a first investigation  @xcite we analyzed the supersonic regime in simulations at a resolution of @xmath79 grid points .",
    "here , we extend the parameter space to include the subsonic and hypersonic regime , as well as two additional reference runs at a resolution of @xmath80 grid points . furthermore , the functional analysis now goes beyond the turbulent energy cascade  we also include the cross - helicity cascade and total sgs flux of both resolved energy and cross - helicity .",
    "finally , the structural analysis now covers alignment and magnitude of the sgs vectors , and topological properties of the sgs stresses .      in total , 15 homogeneous , isotropic turbulence simulations in a periodic box with varying sonic mach number @xmath81 , alfvenic mach number @xmath82 and numerical method were conducted .",
    "all simulations start with uniform initial conditions , i.e. @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( these and all following variables are in dimensionless code units ) within a box of length @xmath85 at resolution of @xmath79 or @xmath80 grid points .",
    "the initial background magnetic field is uniform in the z - direction and its magnitude specified by the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure @xmath86 .",
    "the mhd equations for a compressible fluid are then evolved in time using either enzo@xcite or flashv4@xcite .",

    "[ fig : powerspecallruns ] ]    in addition to filtering at @xmath160 we also probe the closures with filter scales at @xmath165 to investigate the dependence of the result on the chosen scale .",

    "given that we analyze compressible data , we do not employ a sharp spectral filter , which can produce negative resolved densities , and sgs stresses that violate realizability@xcite .",
    "the first category of tests , functional tests , probe the ability of closures to reproduce a particular ( physical ) property .",
    "in addition to this , functional tests can eliminate co - ordiate frame dependence by reduction to scalar diagnostics , e.g. of six sgs stress tensor or three emf vector components .",
    "historically , the most frequently used reference quantity is the turbulent energy flux , i.e. the cascade term @xmath166 it encodes the local exchange between resolved and unresolved energy and is connected to the turbulent energy cascade .",
    "however , as it was recently shown@xcite , the total energy flux term @xmath167 is more strongly influenced by the transport terms @xmath168 rather than the cascade term @xmath169 in our simulations .",

    "the exchange of cross - helicity across the filter scale is analogous to the energy one , with cross - helicity flux @xmath171 again , the total cross - helicity term @xmath172 is dominated by the transport and not the cascade contribution@xcite . in the following we are going to analyze all four ( pseudo-)scalars as each of them may play a crucial role in different dynamical regimes , and systematic differences between results from total and",
    "cascade fluxes may indicate the importance of the differentiation commutator@xcite . specifically , we conduct nonlinear least - square minimization@xcite between data and closure .",
    "this automatically produces the best coefficient @xmath173 for each snapshot and closure individually .",
    "eventually , we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient as an overall measure of accuracy . while these correlations probe the spatially local performance of the closures , we also analyze a global indicator .",
    "in particular , we look at the average sgs dissipation , i.e. the total @xmath169 for each snapshot , and examine the contributions of the individual components .",
    "the performed structural tests start with a topological analysis .",

    "it is clear that the cross - helicity cascade is well modeled in the subsonic regime ( with correlations above 0.8 ) and tends to perform worse in the hypersonic regime ( going down to almost 0.4 ) .",
    "the results for all energy closures and all reference quantities are shown in figure [ fig : energyoverview ] .",
    "in general , all closures perform very well with respect to the cascade fluxes .",
    "a notable exception is the already mentioned cross - helicity cascade correlation of the kinetic scale - similarity model @xmath193 , which has a strong @xmath81 dependency .",
    "in addition to this , it can be seen that the total flux terms are generally less well represented than the cascade terms .",

    "while the mean deviation from the median coefficient over all reference quantities , filter widths and snapshots is only 10% for the nonlinear closure @xmath76 , it varies by @xmath329 for the eddy - viscosity reference closure @xmath237 . compared to the results of @xmath175 in the next paragraph , this is still acceptable , even though we find systematically lower coefficient at @xmath330 compared to @xmath331 .",
    "the sgs maxwell stress results depicted in figure  [ fig : resfilterstudytaub ] show a strong filter scale dependency of the closure coefficient for the scale - similarity @xmath274 and eddy - diffusivity @xmath243 closure .",

    "the correlations of @xmath169 for the box filter are ( within the error bars ) slightly lower ( @xmath337 ) for all models and filter widths . in addition , the correlations exhibit a more pronounced deviation for the total energy flux @xmath305 especially at smaller filter wavenumbers @xmath161 and thus larger filter widths . we attribute this to the non - smooth nature of the box kernel versus the gaussian kernel resulting in numerical biases in the computation of gradient - based quantities .",
    "this could explain why the deviations are more pronounced in the total flux that has an additional divergence operator acting on the sgs terms in comparison to the cascade flux .",
    "likewise , the effect would be more pronounced in the nonlinear closures as they are built from nonlinear combinations of gradients . the observed convergence between box and gaussian filtering with increasing @xmath161 is also expected , because the differences between the kernels become less distinct for small widths .",
    "overall , the observed behavior based on gaussian filtering , i.e. better performance of the nonlinear closures over the scale - similarity and the eddy - dissipation family ones , also holds for filtering with a box kernel .",
    "these trends similarly apply to the cross - helicity fluxes and other sgs terms , too .",
    "we close the functional analysis with a comparison of the contributions by individual components to the average sgs dissipation @xmath169 .",

    ". in general , both sgs pressures ( and thus energies ) are almost negligible ( @xmath343 ) in the reference data even though the data covers the slightly supersonic regime ( simulation 7b ) .",
    "similarly , the deviatoric kinetic sgs stress is subdominant ( @xmath344-@xmath3 ) while the deviatoric magnetic sgs stress and the emf , which jointly contribute @xmath345 to the total sgs dissipation independent of the chosen filter scale . while the magnetic stress dominates at the largest scales ( up to @xmath346 at @xmath322 ) , its contribution constantly decreases , and at the smallest scale the emf is strongest reaching a contribution of @xmath347 .",
    "this can be understood by analyzing the ratio of forward to inverse energy transfer ( not shown ) . while the forward transfer mediated by @xmath339",
    "is @xmath348 times stronger than the inverse transfer at @xmath322 , it is only @xmath349 times stronger at @xmath323 . at the same time",
    "the ratio by the emf remains constantly at a factor @xmath350 .",
    "two scenarios ( or more likely an unbalanced combination thereof ) could potentialy explain this situation : either the existance of an inverse cascade coupled to direct forward transfer , or direct inverse transfer coupled with a forward cascade . on the one hand , a cascade typically transfers energy from one scale to the next smaller ( or larger ) scale resulting in a constant flux with varying filter width . on the other hand",
    ", direct transfer allows exchange of energy between scales with arbitrary separation and thus the flux may vary with varying filter width .",
    "although a more detailed study , e.g. by a shell - to - shell energy transfer analysis , would allow a better interpretation , it is not required for the following closure discussion and we leave it as subject to future work .    before analyzing the predicted contributions by the different closure families , it should be noted that the coefficient from the fit has been used to calculate the resulting dissipation values . allowing all coefficients to vary freely and optimizing for average sgs dissipation would allow each closure to excatly match the reference data and , in turn , render this analysis meaningless . in general , all closure families behave similar with respect to the total dissipation . at large scales they underestimate the reference data by @xmath351 ( eddy - dissipation and scale - similarity ) and @xmath352 ( nonlinear ) , while improving towards the smallest scales reaching @xmath353 ( @xmath354 ) , @xmath355 ( @xmath356 ) and @xmath357 ( @xmath358 ) agreement .",
    "this is seen to be due to the successful capture of the emf related contribution and failing to represent the deviatoric magnetic stress dynamics at varying filter scale . in other words ,",
    "all closures predict too much net inverse energy transfer to the largest scales .",
    "another important observation concerns the overall inverse energy transfer by the magnetic sgs pressure of the eddy - diffusivity closure .",
    "given that the eddy - viscosity and eddy - resistivity closures can not provide inverse energy transfer by construction , and that the eddy - diffusivity closure itself exhibits the overall poorest correlation as shown in the previous subsections , the sgs pressures are the only channels left for inverse transfer in this closure set .",
    "thus , in the process of matching the inverse transfer that is present in the reference data , an over - compensation in the sgs energies takes place .",

    "while @xmath237 is able to reproduce at least the correct tendency with dominating tube structures ( @xmath364 ) , @xmath243 produces an equal share of tube and sheet structures .",
    "interestingly , the topological configuration changes dramatically when analyzing the deviatoric tensor @xmath365 as a whole . the dominant , @xmath81-independent tube - like topology vanishes and sheet configurations become dominant in the subsonic regime . in the supersonic regime tube- and sheet - like configurations are equally present with some ( < @xmath344 ) temporal variation .",

    "<S> even though compressible plasma turbulence is encountered in many astrophysical phenomena , its effect is often not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , direct numerical simulations are typically not able to reach the extreme parameters of these processes . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , large - eddy simulations ( les ) , which only simulate large and intermediate scales directly , are employed . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest , unresolved scales and the interactions between small and large scales are introduced by means of a subgrid - scale ( sgs ) model . </S>",
    "<S> we propose and verify a new set of nonlinear sgs closures for future application as an sgs model in les of compressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use 15 simulations ( without explicit sgs model ) of forced , isotropic , homogeneous turbulence with varying sonic mach number @xmath0 to @xmath1 as reference data for the most extensive _ a priori_tests performed so far in literature . in these tests </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly filter the reference data and compare the performance of the new closures against the most widely tested closures . </S>",
    "<S> these include eddy - viscosity and scale - similarity type closures with different normalizations . </S>",
    "<S> performance indicators are correlations with the turbulent energy and cross - helicty flux , the average sgs dissipation , the topological structure and the ability to reproduce the correct magnitude and direction of the sgs vectors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only the new nonlinear closures exhibit consistently high correlations ( median value > @xmath2 ) with the data over the entire parameter space and outperform the other closures in all tests . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that these results are independent of resolution and chosen filter scale . additionally , the new closures are effectively coefficient - free with a deviation of less than @xmath3 . </S>"
