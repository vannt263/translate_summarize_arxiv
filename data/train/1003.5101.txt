    "dissociative recombination ( dr ) with electrons is the most important loss channel for molecular ions in cold dilute plasmas and a source of energetic neutral atoms and excited molecules  @xcite .",
    "rate coefficients , branching ratios , and the energy sharing between internal and external degrees of freedom of the fragments are thus important ingredients in modeling these plasmas .",
    "even though a good understanding of the dr process of diatomic molecular ions has been reached in recent years , theory is not yet capable of supplying most of the information needed for these studies .",
    "experimental investigations of the dr process in particular of polyatomic systems are thus still indispensable to further constrain the parameters of these models and to provide basic theory with detailed and reliable results for crucial benchmark systems .",
    "considerable experimental progress in studying the dr process has been made since the advent of heavy - ion storage rings with merging electron beam facilities , which allow to control the inner excitation of the molecular ions and the relative ion - electron energy precisely enough to produce data in the parameter space of interest for , e.g. , planetary atmospheres or interstellar chemistry .",
    "results obtained so far were vital in helping to unravel the processes governing the dr and to clarify many important and pertinent issues . but despite these experimental advances for particular diatomic systems , detailed investigations of the dr of more complex ions , such as measurements of branching ratios at relative energies other than zero , of the inner excitation of the molecular fragments or of their dissociation kinematics , are still hampered due to the limitations of presently available detection techniques in identifying the dr reaction products .",
    "we have therefore developed an * e*nergy - sensitive * mu*lti - strip detector system ( emu ) that is capable of recording multi - fragment events following the dr of polyatomic molecular ions and to identify the fragments by their masses .",
    "the system has been installed at the ion storage ring tsr of the max - planck institute for nuclear physics , which can store molecular ions of mev energies and is equipped with an electron cooler as well as an electron target employing a cryogenic photocathode , so that electron - ion collision energies can be freely set in the mev to ev range with unprecedented resolution  @xcite . while the main aim of the setup is to provide a universal tool for measuring dr branching ratios of polyatomic molecular ions into the different final fragment channels , the position resolution is sufficient to allow also for 2d imaging of the breakup geometries .",
    "the new setup has thus several advantages as compared to previous approaches  @xcite , where grids of different transmissions ( yielding a set of linear combinations of the rates for individual fragment channels ) were employed in order to determine the branching ratios , a technique which is usually only applied at zero relative electron - ion energies for background reasons and which does not support molecular imaging .",
    "the present paper discusses the concept and realization of the emu detection system and exemplifies its properties and possibilities by using the new setup to investigate the dissociative recombination of d@xmath2h@xmath3 .",
    "the dr of d@xmath2h@xmath3  was studied before in several storage ring experiments , and rate coefficients  @xcite , the fragmentation geometry of the three - body channel  @xcite , and branching ratios  @xcite have been reprted .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath8 released in the three fragmentation channels , for ions and fragments in their ground states and relative ion - electron energies @xmath9  ev , are @xmath10 the branching ratios measured at @xmath11  ev were reported to be @xmath12=76.5(2.2)% , @xmath13=13.5(1.5)% , and @xmath14=10.0(0.7)%  @xcite .",
    "since the beam energies @xmath15 of the molecular ions stored in the tsr are very large as compared to the release energies occurring in dr experiments , the fragments resulting from a dr event of a molecular ion of mass number @xmath16 are traveling within a narrow cone around the ion beam axis , and the kinetic energy @xmath17 of the fragment @xmath18 is to a very good approximation given by @xmath19 and is thus a measure of the mass number @xmath20 of the fragment . by recording separately the energies of all dr fragments of an dr event with a large area multi - hit - capable detector",
    "the fragmentation channel can be uniquely identified .    in the present setup the energy - sensitive multi - hit detector",
    "is realized by a large area ( 10@xmath010@xmath1 ) position - sensitive , double - sided si - strip detector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - concept ] ) .",
    "the energy- and position - sensitivity to particles hitting the detector is achieved through 128 vertical ( x- ) and 128 horizontal ( y- ) strips on the front and back side of the detector , respectively , which are read out individually by preserving the pulse height , i.e. , the energy information .",
    "the readout system also ensures via the timing information that the detected particles belong to a single dr event .",
    "the detector is mounted about @xmath21  @xmath22  10 m downstream of the electron target outside of the magnetic lattice of the tsr such that it can only be hit by neutral fragments .",
    "concept of the emu detector : a fast , neutralized molecule is dissociating at a distance @xmath21 from a position- and energy - sensitive detector .",
    "the fragments continue to travel approximately at the velocity of the molecule , but due to the kinetic energy released in the dissociation they acquire macroscopic distances from the transversal center - of - mass ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) when hitting the detector .",
    "the position ( @xmath25,@xmath26 ) and the energy @xmath17 of each fragment is recorded.,width=302 ]    the impact of @xmath27 fragments from a single dr event on the detector leads to @xmath28 responding x - strips @xmath25 and @xmath29 responding y - strips @xmath26 with corresponding energies @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the detection of all fragments can be easily verified by checking whether the two energy relations @xmath32 are fulfilled .",
    "the measured fragment mass numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 corresponding to the energies recorded on the individual strips are given by @xmath35 in the following we will refer to the set of measured mass numbers @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the corresponding strip coordinates @xmath25 , @xmath26 as the hit pattern of the dr event .",
    "the coordinates of the center - of - mass @xmath36 of the detected event in the detector plane are given by @xmath37 and an estimate for the transversal kinetic energy release @xmath38 can be determined from the projected weighted distances @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 using @xmath41 where @xmath21 is the distance between the center of the electron target and the detector .",
    "while eqs .",
    "( [ energies])-([transversal - energies ] ) are valid even in cases where more than one fragment hit the same strip , the strip - wise readout of only two coordinate planes together with the finite strip width leads to ambiguities in the determination of the breakup geometry from the hit pattern , which in some cases also affects the identification of the fragmentation channel .",
    "we shall first discuss these ambiguities for the specific case of the dr of d@xmath2h@xmath3 , before we consider the more general case .",
    "figure  [ fig - ambiguity ] depicts the two most frequent of these ambiguities . the hit pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ambiguity](a ) is indistinguishable from the hit pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ambiguity](b ) ; this pattern thus results in two solutions concerning the fragmentation geometry .",
    "however , the identification of the fragmentation channel is still unique .",
    "this is no longer the case for the hit pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ambiguity](c ) , where the h and the two ds from the 3-body fragmentation channel are forming an l - shaped pattern with the h in the corner such that only two horizontal and two vertical strips are responding .",
    "this pattern can not be distinguished from that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ambiguity](d ) , which results from the detection of a molecular hd- and an atomic d - fragment from the 2-body channel ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "besides the even less likely occurrence of two or more fragments hitting the same x- _ and _ y - strip , i.e. , the same ( @xmath43)-pixel , these l - shaped patterns are the only patterns in the dr of d@xmath2h@xmath3 , which can not be attributed uniquely to a fragmentation channel .",
    "since the probability for the occurrence of this pattern is small due to the narrow strip width of @xmath44  @xmath45 m realized in the present setup , we attribute these patterns to the channel with the smaller number of fragments , that is for the case discussed in figs .  [ fig - ambiguity](c , d ) to the hd+d channel .",
    "the influence of these miss - assignments on the accuracy of the branching ratios is small and can moreover be corrected for with the help of monte carlo simulations ( see also sec .

    "the identification of the fragmentation channel and of the fragmentation geometry is not subject to any other ambiguities . in the dr of polyatomic molecules , which contain several atoms of the same mass and fragment into channels containing two or more identical fragments ,",
    "the main ambiguities hampering the identification of the fragmentation channels are again due to the l - shaped ( sub-)pattern involving two identical fragments at the two ends of the l. the interpretation of hit patterns in terms of the fragmentation geometries is subject to similar ambiguities as discussed above , but the number of geometries leading to a specific pattern will strongly increase with the number of identical fragments .",
    "however , we again would like to point out that the center - of - mass determination by eq .",

    "the increased thicknesses of the p@xmath3si and the al layer at the edges of the strips , which ensure a clean separation between the strips and a loss - free readout and which affect about 14  % of the active area of the detector , result in additional , slightly down - shifted peaks in the pulse height spectra ; particles traversing this part of the entrance window suffer a larger energy loss which is specific for the fragment energy , mass , and its nuclear charge .",

    "after injection the ion beam was first phase - space cooled by the velocity - matched electron beam supplied by the electron target , which had a density of 9@xmath010@xmath52@xmath53 and a transversal temperature of approximately 1.5mev ( expansion factor 20 ) .",
    "at these conditions the effective length of the electron target is 115 cm , with an additional 20 cm on either end where the electron beam is merged with and demerged from the ion beam .",
    "after a few seconds the ion beam was phase - space cooled to a beam diameter below 1.0 mm .",
    "the electron beam was then used as a target , either at matched or detuned electron velocities .",
    "the detuning energy @xmath54 , which measures the average electron - ion collision energy in the center - of - mass system , was adjusted to values between 0 and 20ev by changing the acceleration voltage of the electron beam . at detuning energies @xmath55",
    "the electron beam velocity was switched at a rate of 10 - 100  hz between @xmath54 = 0 and the required energy @xmath54 in order to keep the ion beam phase - spaced cooled .",
    "data was recorded between a few seconds and up to 30s after injection , and count rates were limited to @xmath56khz .",
    "the first analysis step consists of shifting the pulse height spectra of the individual strips to a common scale in order to compensate for the slightly different amplifications and offsets of the individual electronic channels using the d@xmath2h@xmath3  data .",
    "the sums of all 128 x- and of all 128 y - strip spectra performed after this calibration step , are displayed in fig .",

    "while the overall energy resolution reached with the y - strips on the back side of the detector ( e.g. , @xmath57(fwhm)@xmath58  kev for ds of 0.96  mev ) is already very satisfactory , the resolution of the front side strips is worse by almost a factor of two .",
