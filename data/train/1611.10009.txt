    "the spin crossover ( sco ) was discovered by combi almost 80 years ago @xcite , but so far it attracts the attention of researchers .",
    "primerely , the interest to sco- systems is connected with the hope to design the free - inertial molecular two - state switches which can be used to store and process information in fast computational devices .",
    "development of nano - technology prompts the study of this phenomenon in order to use certain properties of the sco in the quantum transport and creation of a new generation of sensors and displays @xcite .",
    "the sco phenomenon is associated with the energy level crossing of the two different spin multiplets of magnetic ion under changing of some external parameters , i.e. temperature , composition , pressure , irradiation light , etc . due to its cooperative nature",
    ", the sco connects the micro- and macroscopic properties of the system .",
    "it is sometimes referred to sco as a phase transition of a special type - the so - called supercritical transitions @xcite .",
    "a nice example of a supercritical transition is spin transition in ferropericlase at high pressure , that probably takes place in the earth s mantle @xcite .",
    "transition metal ( tm ) complexes embedded in a matrix of polymeric gels are widely used in medicine , catalysis , in nonlinear optics , photochromic and photorefractive systems , water purification , for creation of materials with nano - scale functionality , and in other areas .",
    "recently these materials have attracted attention , since interaction of metals with polymeric gels results in unusual properties of hybrid organic - metal materials .",
    "the external hydrostatic pressure , being applied to the sco- materials , modifies the properties of the crystal lattice and reveals the role of the elastic fields in the cooperative interaction of the sco- complexes .",
    "the pressure changes the volume characteristics of complex molecules , in particular , the distance between the central ion and ligand atoms .",
    "thus , it affects the strength of the crystal field .    in order to obtain materials for possible use in mass storage devices or color displays",
    "one- , two- and three - dimensional sco- compunds were synthesized .",
    "study of the pressure efffect in these compounds sheds light on the role of within and interchain interactions , interplanar and volume interactions in the characteristics of these materials .",
    "intensive theoretical studies are devoted to the development of various models of the spin transition by considering different schemes that relate cooperativity of the transition in a separate complex with a transition in a medium containing a macroscopic number of complexes .    to date",
    ", the effect of pressure and temperature on the spin transition was described in terms of various approaches and approximations .",
    "one of the more common approaches is based on the landau theory of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the second successful approach is based on the ising model @xcite .",
    "a third approach is the microscopic one @xcite .",
    "each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages ( for discussion see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the last decade , in this area a lot of works based on the theory of electron density potential has been appeared .",
    "in particular , frequency - power characteristics of the vibrational modes in the first coordination sphere was obtained for specific compounds . by applying the theory electron density potential and molecular dynamics , the sco properties and identified areas of the existence of different phases",
    "have been obtained for [ @xmath3 compound @xcite . to our best knowledge",
    ", this is the first study in which a phase diagram of the sco- compounds has been obtained .",
    "there have also been proposed and studied by methods of molecular dynamics @xcite and monte carlo @xcite various models in which the elastic constant depends on the distance between the structural elements .",
    "along with the use of static pressure for the study of spin transitions , in the literature there are also studies on the effect of impact pressure on the spin state of coordination complexes , such as [ @xmath4 @xcite . it was shown that a relatively low pressure pulse of 0.02 gpa is capable to induce an almost complete conversion of the spin on the hysteresis branches .",
    "such effects may be applied to a spin state switching devices by using sco- materials .",
    "cooperative effects in such systems lead to different hysteresis phenomena and play an important role in the practical applications and understanding of their nature .",
    "one can single out several essential types of interaction between metal ions , namely , electron - phonon , quadrupole and exchange interaction .",
    "since , the direct overlap of @xmath5-orbitals of neighboring ions in the tms is small , the main mechanism of the exchange interaction in these compounds is the kramers - anderson indirect exchange ( or , as it is often called superexchange ) .",
    "cooperativeness in magnetic dielectrics is usually caused by interatomic exchange interaction .",
    "however , this mechanism does not work in sco- systems with the ground state being low - spin ( ls ) singlet ion level .",
    "generally , the magnetic cations of organometallic complexes are connected to each other by chemical bridges , and cooperative effects are realized through elastic interaction . in the literature , we found a few works that discuss cooperative magnetic nature through the exchange interaction between the excited high - spin ( hs ) states ( see . , i.e. , @xcite ) . in all these works the form of the exchange interaction is postulated phenomenologically , as heisenberg exchange interaction with empirical parameters .",
    "spin system with crossover include extensive class of materials : organometallic complexes , organic radicals , inorganic salts and transition metal oxides . in all these compounds , along with elastic interaction",
    ", the exchange interaction plays an important role in the formation of cooperativeness @xcite .",
    "the most common and versatile approach to the sco problem is based on the effective hamiltonian . within this approach",
    ", all these materials are treating from a single point of view .",
    "however , when two different spin multiplets are close , effective interaction between the magnetic cations may be far from the heisenberg interaction , and the effective hamiltonian should be obtained from a microscopic approach .",
    "the present work is devoted to a neat derivation of the effective hamiltonian for tm- oxides with sco and study influence of arising cooperative effects on formation of the physical features of these materials , as well . within the framework of the effective hamiltonian approach , we study effect of the exchange interaction on the sco .    in our approach ,",
    "the orbital hs- and ls - states of the tm- ion are described in terms of one - half pseudospin . to obtain all parameters of the effective hamiltonian , we applied ( lda + gtb)- method @xcite .",
    "the use of projection operators hubbard , as part of the ( lda + gtb)- method , yielded a number of new terms , previously not considered .",
    "they are responsible for the exciton type interaction .",
    "this opens up interesting possibilities for further research both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the sco- systems , for instance , interaction with radiation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we derive the effective hamiltonian for the multi - band model of strongly correlated tm- oxides . in sec .",
    "3 the sco phenomena is studied in the mean field approximation . in sec .",
    "4 the results of numerical simulations are presented . in conclusion",
    "we discuss the obtained results .",
    "for the tm- compounds with the predominant type of ionic bond ( i.e. oxides , halides , etc . ) , strong electron correlations determine the dielectric and magnetic properties .",
    "the commonly accepted minimal model for description of such compounds is a multi - band @xmath0-model .",
    "this model explicitly takes into account the coulomb interaction of @xmath5- electrons of the tm- ion .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model can be written as @xmath6 here the first term , @xmath7 , describes the @xmath5-electrons in the crystal field : @xmath8 and their coulomb interaction . the second term , @xmath9 , with the hopping integral being @xmath10 , describes @xmath11-electrons of oxygen or other ligands involved in @xmath12- and @xmath13-coupling @xmath14 .",
    "the third term , @xmath15 , characterizes the hybridization of the cation - anion states .    in this approach",
    "the coulomb energy of @xmath11-electrons is usually neglected . however , if necessary , it can be easily taken into account within the framework of our ( lda + gtb)- approach ( see below ) .",
    "multi - band @xmath0-model , with all coulomb interactions : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath0 being included , was discussed in @xcite    an important advantage of this multi - orbital model is the ability to form different many - electron states ( terms ) of the transition metal s ion .",
    "these terms are characterized by different values of the spin , @xmath18 , and the orbital angular momentum .",
    "for @xmath19-ion in the crystal field , the ground state depends on the relationship between the hund exchange constant , @xmath20 , and crystal field , @xmath21 .    in some cases",
    ", the amount of cation - anion hybridization makes its contribution @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the crystal field depends on the interatomic distance and it is changed when the external pressure or `` chemical pressure '' is applied .",
    "the chemical pressure appears when isovalent substitution occurs in a series of solid solutions or stretching . for ionic",
    "crystals energy terms of @xmath19- electron configurations in a cubic crystal field have been obtained numerically .",
    "the results are presented by the so - called tanabe - sugano diagrams @xcite .    in the framework of the ( lda + gtb)-approach",
    ", parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) are obtained from the first principles . in order to adequately account electron correlations , the cluster approach of generalized tight - binding method",
    "is applied ( gtb ) @xcite .    in the gtb approach the crystal lattice",
    "is divided into clusters ( `` elementary cells '' ) , and the total hamiltonian is presented by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is related to the contribution of all noninteracting clusters , and @xmath24 describes hopping and interaction between clusters .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath25 , can be diagonalized exactly , and we denote by @xmath26 its eigenstates with the energy @xmath27 .",
    "next step is to introduce the hubbard @xmath28-operators .",
    "they are defined as follows : @xmath29 .",
    "algebra of @xmath28-operators is determined by the multiplying rule , @xmath30 , and the completeness condition , @xmath31 .",
    "the indices @xmath11 and @xmath32 , being collective indices , contain a set of the following quantum numbers , characterizing the state of the system : the number of electrons @xmath33 per unit cell , an irreducible representation @xmath34 , that describes the transformation of the orbital part of the wave function under action of the point symmetry group of the given crystal , the magnitude of the spin , @xmath35 , and its projection , @xmath36 .",
    "thus , one can write , @xmath37 .",
    "it is assumed that for the neighbor cells the eigenstates are orthogonal .",
    "if not , for instance , as in the case when two adjacent clusters share a common oxygen , one needs to use the orthogonalization procedure , employing the wannier functions instead of the group of oxygen orbitals . for the first time",
    "such a procedure has been proposed for the three - band @xmath0-model in @xcite and generalized to a multi - band model in @xcite .",
    "since the hubbard operators form a linearly independent basis , any local operator can be expressed as a linear combination of x - operators .",
    "for instance , a single - electron annihilation operator , @xmath38 , in a @xmath39-cell with the band index @xmath40 , can be written as , @xmath41 . in the @xmath28-operators representation",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) takes the form , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the chemical potential and @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 are the hopping matrix elements in the basis of the orthogonalized wannier functions .",
    "the sco occurs in the case of the energy level crossing of the two different spin states under the influence of external factors .    in what follows ,",
    "we generalize the method of projection operators , developed for the hubbard model @xcite , to obtain the effective hamiltonian from ( [ eq2 ] ) , by excluding the interband hopping integral through the dielectric gap .",
    "we define the projection operator @xmath46 as , @xmath47 in the r.h.s . of the eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) only those states @xmath48 and @xmath49 are taken into consideration , for which the number of electrons per unit cell , @xmath33 , is more ( or less ) than it follows from the electrical neutrality condition .",
    "as one can see , the operators @xmath46 and @xmath50 satisfy the following identity : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "let us consider the auxiliar hamiltonian , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being a formal parameter .",
    "at the end of computation we set @xmath57 . using the identity @xmath58",
    ", one can show that @xmath59 .",
    "we employ the method of operator perturbation theory to eliminate the processes with the interband hopping .",
    "the essence of the operator perturbation theory is that , using a canonical transformation , @xmath60 , one can choose the operator @xmath61 so that the linear in @xmath56 terms of the hamiltonian , @xmath62 , i. e. those members who are responsible for the interband hopping , vanish .",

    ", one can show that the effective hamiltonian in the representation of spin operators , @xmath68 , and pseudospin operators , @xmath69 , becomes @xmath70    here , the first term describes the exchange contribution to the heisenberg hamiltonian , @xmath71 stand for operators of the particles on the @xmath72-node , the parameter @xmath73 corresponds to the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ordering , respectively , and @xmath74 are the projection operators defined in the subspace of eigenstates of the projection pseudospin operator , @xmath75 , with the eigenvalues being @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the index @xmath78 takes the value 1 for the hs- state and 2 for the ls- state of the system . the second term in eq.([eq7 ] ) describes variation in the relative energy of electronic configurations for ls- and hs- states under the influence of the applied pressure @xmath79 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) we set @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the energy gap between the ls- and hs- states at zero pressure .    the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) includes the interaction of the exciton type .",
    "the most simple form it takes for two - level system . in this case",
    "orbital and spin singlet , @xmath82 , stand for the ls- state , and the hs- state is described by spin triplet , @xmath83 , with the spin projections being , @xmath84 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 can be written as ,    @xmath86    where on the @xmath72-site the hubbard operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 describe the transitions in the spin subspace of the system from the singlet state to the triplet state with the projection of the spin @xmath12 , and vice versa .",
    "the operators @xmath89 and @xmath90 have the same meaning for the orbital part of the wave functions .",
    "note that the interaction between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom has long been studied in the literature in the kugel - khomskii model @xcite .",
    "our hamiltonian contains formally similar combination of the pseudospin spin and operators , but the physical origin of there is different from the analogues in the kugel - khomskii model .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq7 ] ) can be generalized by including the phonon interaction between tm- ions and spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the phonon contribution is described by [ 43 ] , @xmath91 where the coupling constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 are determined by the interaction of different phonon modes of the lattice .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction in the highest order of the perturbation theory leads to the mixture of the the ls- and hs- states caused by tunneling of the system through a potential barrier between the ls- and hs- states .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written as @xcite , @xmath94    in recent years the unusual properties of supramolecules , containing spin - active coordinated tm- ions of the iron group , have increasingly drawn the attention of researchers .",
    "these systems exhibit induce both , the thermal sco and the sco arising under the impact of pressure , or as a result of the light irradiation of the sample ( liesst - effect ) the liesst spin transition , hs @xmath95ls , being induced by the interaction of the vibronic levels of different multiplicity , is often accompanied by hysteresis @xcite .",
    "irradiation of frozen @xmath96 ( bf4)_2 $ ] sample at a wavelength of @xmath97 results in spin - allowed transitions @xmath98 .",
    "the excited state would relax back to the initial singlet state , unless the spin - orbit interaction had provided intersystem transitions in the triplet states , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "these states overlap with the quintet , @xmath101 , which then relaxes into a metastable state @xmath102 .",
    "the latter can exist indefinitely at low temperatures , since the potential barrier separates it from the ground state @xmath103 . to reverse liesst ,",
    "the low - lying state @xmath104 should exist .",
    "this state is an intermediate in the two intersystem crossing and can decay into @xmath105 and @xmath103 .",

    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) ) are directly related to the liesst - effect and can be used for description and simulation of the sco in supramolecule systems .",

    "<S> within the framework of a realistic multi - band @xmath0-model , we derived an effective hamiltonian to describe the exchange interaction effects near the spin crossover in magnetic mott - hubbard insulators under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that single - ion mechanism of spin crossover under change of the crystal field does not lead to a thermodynamic phase transition , however , at @xmath1 a quantum phase transition appears . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the cooperativity leads to a modification of the quantum phase transition to a first - order phase transition and the appearance of metastable states of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - temperature phase diagram has been obtained to describe the magnetization and high - spin population near the spin crossover of the mott s dielectrics with @xmath2-ions . </S>"
