    "the bell test involves correlations at time differences of the order of @xmath233 and a proper choice of the frequency mismatch @xmath234 always allows one to render the contribution from equilibrium fluctuations negligible .",
    "another restriction on @xmath235 is due to dephasing and electron - electron interactions ; we then have to assume that the characteristic times associated with these processes are larger then @xmath235 .",
    "we have discussed how to make use of quantum indistinguishability as a resource to generate non - classical correlations : the indistinguishability of particles enforces proper symmetrization of their wave function and results in non - factorizable states .",
    "we have demonstrated how to generate such states with the help of quantum dots residing in the coulomb blockade regime and have determined their degree of entanglement as measured in a bell inequality test based on auto- and cross - current correlators . in a real experiment , the latter",
    "are measured over a finite time or space domain . as a result",
    ", we obtain an interesting interplay between the measurement accuracy ( time or space resolution ) and the degree of non - locality as measured in the bell inequality test : the more information is gained that locally distinguishes between the particles , the smaller is the degree of violation .",
    "once the uncertainty principle allows for the identification of the particle , the bell inequality can not be violated any longer .",
    "this feature can be exploited in the design of experiments testing the above predictions : choosing a small energy difference @xmath236 allows for a slow measurement with a less stringent time resolution , while the violation of the bell test remains observable .",
    "on the other hand , the energy difference @xmath237 has to be chosen sufficiently large in order to avoid the influence of decoherence or interactions .",
