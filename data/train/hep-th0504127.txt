    "black holes are characteristic objects to general theory of relativity .",
    "recent observational data show the existence of one or more huge black holes in the central region of a number of galaxies .",
    "while over the past decades much concerning the nature of black hole spacetimes has been clarified , a good many unsolved problems remain .",
    "one of the most important ones is what the final state of black - hole evaporation through quantum effects is .",
    "the mid - galaxy supermassive black holes are certainly not related to this problem ; however , it has been suggested that tiny black holes , whose quantum effect should not be neglected , could be formed in the early universe by the gravitational collapse of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "black holes may become small enough in the final stage of evaporation enough for quantum aspects of gravity to become noticeable .",
    "in other words , such tiny black holes may provide a good opportunity for learning not only about strong gravitational fields but also about of the quantum aspects of gravity .",
    "up to now many quantum theories of gravity have been proposed . among them",
    "superstring / m - theory formulated in the higher dimensional spacetime is the most promising candidate .",
    "so far , however , no much is known about the non - perturbative aspects of the theory have not been to take string effects perturbatively into classical gravity is one approach to the study of the quantum effects of gravity .",
    "a recent and attractive proposal for a new picture of our universe called the braneworld universe  @xcite is based on superstring / m - theory  @xcite .",
    "according to these we live on a four - dimensional timelike hypersurface embedded in a higher - dimensional bulk spacetime . because the fundamental scale could be around tev scale in this scenario",
    ", these models suggest that creation of tiny black holes in a linear hadron collider is possible  @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the investigation of the string effects on the black holes is important .    in this paper",
    "we consider the @xmath0-dimensional action with the gauss - bonnet terms for gravity  @xcite , which we call gauss - bonnet gravity hereafter , as the higher curvature corrections to general relativity .",
    "the gauss - bonnet terms naturally arise as the next leading order of the @xmath18-expansion of superstring theory , where @xmath18 is inverse string tension  @xcite , and are ghost - free combinations  @xcite .",
    "the black hole solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity were first discovered by boulware and deser  @xcite and wheeler  @xcite , independently . since",
    "then many types of black hole solutions have been intensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the black hole solutions with a cosmological constant were investigated in several papers  @xcite . in the system with a negative cosmological constant , black holes can have horizons with non - spherical topology such as torus , hyperboloid , and other compactified sub - manifolds .",
    "these solutions were originally found in general relativity and are called topological black holes  @xcite .",
    "they are distinctive in that there exist zero - mass and negative mass black hole solutions , and in both cases their properties were investigated  @xcite .",
    "topological black hole solutions have also been studied in gauss - bonnet gravity  @xcite .",
    "black hole solutions in more general lovelock gravity  @xcite have also been investigated  @xcite    in gauss - bonnet gravity , there are two kinds of black hole solutions , which are classified into the plus and the minus branches .",
    "when boulware and deser first discovered the solutions , they claimed that the vacuum state in one of the branches ( the plus branch in our definition ) are unstable  @xcite , so that the solutions in the minus branch have been intensively investigated , while less attention has been paid to the solutions in the plus branch .",
    "however , the vacuum states in both branches have recently turned out to be stable  @xcite . moreover , it is known that the solutions in five - dimensional gauss - bonnet gravity have qualitatively different properties from those of higher - dimensions",
    ". there is , however , a lack of detailed investigations of the five - dimensional case .    in this paper , we extend the previous work and give a unified viewpoint on the black hole solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "we include all the aforementioned cases , i.e. , the plus and the minus branches , five- and higher - dimensional cases .",
    "in particular , we focus on the global structure of the spacetime .",
    "we also consider the case with a positive / negative cosmological constant and that with a sub - manifold with non - spherical topology .",
    "we investigate not only the black hole solutions but also other kinds of solutions , such as regular or globally naked solutions .    in sec .",

    "then we should examine the condition @xmath89 directly .",

    "we call this type of horizon an almost degenerate horizon .",

    "before investigating the system with the gauss - bonnet terms , we first review the spacetime structure of the static solutions described by the metric form ( [ metric ] ) in the einstein-@xmath1 system using the @xmath12-@xmath13 diagram for comparison .    by taking the limit of @xmath98 , gauss - bonnet gravity reduces to general relativity . in this limit , @xmath99 is obtained only for the minus branch of eq .",
