    "for many years the radiative @xmath0 decay ( rpd ) process ( @xmath2 ) has been an open window for the speculation about new physics ( np ) @xcite .",
    "the available experimental data @xcite seemed to indicate a deficit of events in one region when compared to the standard model ( sm ) prediction .    the physical description of the process can be split into two pieces : the inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) contribution contribution and the structure - dependent ( sd ) contribution , described by two form factors .",
    "still we lack a complete analysis of the process including @xmath1 dependence in the form factors , and this is the main purpose of this work .",
    "we will use the resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath3 t ) for the description of the form factors @xcite .    within the sm",
    "the sd contributions can be parametrized by a vector form factor and a axial - vector form factor .",
    "a tensor form factor would interfere destructively in the region in which the deficit of events occurs .",
    "the axial - vector form factor has already been calculated @xcite .",
    "the vvp green function so far has been calculated only with one multiplet of vector meson resonances and it is not able to fulfil at the same time all the short distance constraints@xcite . including a second multiplet we can satisfy all the requirements and we obtain a reliable vector form factor @xcite : @xmath4 were @xmath5 is fixed by the anomaly and @xmath6 is fitted from the @xmath7 phenomenology .",
    "finally with this framework we calculate the tensor hadronic matrix element , usually expressed through the so called magnetic susceptibility @xmath3 and the vector meson couplings to vector and tensor currents : @xmath8 with the new but preliminary data from the pibeta collaboration @xcite the mismatch now is gone , as can be seen in tab .",
