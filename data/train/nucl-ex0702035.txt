    "the study of heavy flavors in relativistic nuclear collisions follows two different approaches : ( i ) the direct reconstruction of heavy flavored mesons and ( ii ) the study of semi - leptonic decays of such mesons . in this section",
    "we describe these methods , used by star and phenix , and discuss their advantages and limitations .",
    "direct reconstruction of heavy - flavor mesons is being performed by the star collaboration using the decay channel @xmath0 ( and c.c . ) with branching ratio of 3.83% in _ _",
    "d__+au  and au+aucollisions . because of the small branching ratio and the lack of dedicated detector triggers , the direct reconstruction of @xmath1-mesons requires the analysis of large amount of data .",
    "the available statistics limits the study of such mesons to the low-  region ( @xmath2 gev / c ) .",
    "kaons and pions are identified using the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting invariant mass spectrum of kaon - pion pairs contains a substantial amount of background from random combinatorics that can be subtracted using mixed event methods .",
    "details of the analysis can be found in ref @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_reco]-a shows an invariant mass distribution after event mixing subtraction where a clear @xmath4 peak can be seen .",
    "despite the limitation on  and statistics , direct reconstruction of @xmath1-mesons is the cleanest probe to investigate heavy quarks in relativistic nuclear collisions .      direct reconstruction of @xmath1-mesons can be done only by star in a limited  range and still difficult to perform with high efficiency in high multiplicity events . in this case",
    "semi - leptonic decays of such mesons ( ex : @xmath5 ) provide a more efficient measurement of charm and bottom production . at rhic two methods",
    "are utilized to measure heavy flavor production via semileptonic decays : ( i ) identification of electrons from @xmath1 and @xmath6-meson decays and ( ii ) identification of muons from @xmath1-meson decays .",
    "the analysis of non - photonic electrons ( the excess of electrons after subtracting all possible sources of background , such as photon conversions and dalitz decays ) is a technique used by star and phenix .",
    "electron identification in star is done using the @xmath3 and momentum ( @xmath7 ) information from the tpc and the time of flight ( tof ) data for low-  ( @xmath8 gev / c ) electrons @xcite or energy ( @xmath9 ) and shower shape in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) for high-  ( @xmath10 gev / c ) electrons @xcite ( see figure [ fig_reco]-b ) .    electron identification in phenix @xcite is largely based on the ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) in conjunction with a highly granular emc .",
    "the momentum is derived from drift and pad chambers .",
    "a major difficulty in the electron analysis for both experiments is the fact that there are many sources of electrons other than semi - leptonic decays of heavy - flavor mesons .",
    "the main sources of background are photon conversion in the detector material ( less significant in phenix due to the reduced amount of material when compared to star ) and @xmath11 and @xmath12 dalitz decays .",
    "other sources of background , such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 decays are also taken into account , although their contribution is small compared to the sources mentioned above .",
    "these background sources are commonly called photonic electrons .    background subtraction in the phenix experiment is performed by two different methods : ( i ) the converter method , in which a well defined amount of material is added to the detector to increase the number of background electrons . by comparing the electron spectra with and without the converter it is possible to measure directly a significant part of the background .",
    "( ii ) the cocktail method , with which phenix measures the spectra of the main background sources ( photons , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "both methods agree to each other very well .",
    "due to its the large acceptance and tracking efficiency , star can directly reconstruct a considerable fraction of the photonic background by performing invariant mass reconstruction of @xmath16 pairs with high efficiency . for photon conversion , @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 dalitz decays the invariant mass spectrum shows a peak near zero mass .",
    "other background sources are evaluated by simulations and account for a very small fraction of the total background in this case .",
    "muon identification at low-  ( @xmath17 gev / c ) plays an important role because this  range imposes a significant constrain on the measurement of charm cross section @xcite .",
    "this measurement is being done by star using @xmath3 and momentum information from the tpc and mass reconstruction from the tof detector .",
    "a clear muon signal can be reconstructed , as seen in figure [ fig_reco]-c .",
    "background from @xmath18 and @xmath19 decays can be subtracted by looking at the dca ( distance of closest approach ) between the muon and the primary vertex of the collision .",
    "the determination of the total charm cross section via non - photonic electrons requires precise measurements down to very low- .",
    "this is an experimental challenge : the lower the , the higher the amount of photonic electrons that contaminates the measurement , resulting in large systematic uncertainties . in order to overcome",
    "this limitation star performs three independent measurements : direct reconstruction of d - mesons , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the total charm cross section is obtained from a combined fit of these measurements @xcite as illustrated in figure [ fig_xs]-a .",
    "phenix , on the other hand , uses its @xmath21 measurements to extract total cross sections @xcite . to overcome the large background at low-  phenix is improving analysis techniques in order to reduce systematic uncertainties due to photonic background .",
    "this allowed a decrease in the minimum  that can be measured by phenix from @xmath22 in the earlier datasets to @xmath23 gev / c ( figure [ fig_xs]-b ) .",

    "shown is the total cross section per binary collision .",
    "figure [ figsummary]-a makes evident a factor of @xmath26 between star and phenix , this difference being larger than the combined systematic uncertainties in the case of central au+au  collisions .",
    "the dashed line in this figure depicts the average prediction from fonll calculations @xcite for charm production at rhic energies and the yellow band its uncertainty determined by independent variation of quark masses , renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "the dash - dotted lines correspond to the average values for both experiments . despite the differences between experiments",
    "the results , for each experiment , suggest that charm production follows a binary scaling from  to central au+aucollisions .",
    "this is a strong indication that charm are predominantly produced in the early stages of the collision evolution and other processes , such as thermal production in the qgp , are not significant .",
    "figure [ figsummary]-b shows the ratio of star @xcite and phenix @xcite measurements to fonll calculations for high-  electrons in  collisions at rhic .",
    "the dash - dotted lines correspond to the ratio of the experimental to fonll cross section .",
    "this makes evident that the factor of @xmath26 discrepancy in the cross section extends up to large  values .",
    "note that , despite this normalization discrepancy fonll describes the shape of the measured spectra well in both cases , suggesting that the differences between the measurements may be related to an experimental normalization effect .",
    "future rhic measurements will address this experimental discrepancy .",
    "star is planning a run without its inner tracking detectors ( svt and ssd ) in the next years thus reducing the amount of photon conversion and will address in detail some of the systematic uncertainties in the background removal of the electron measurements . added to that , both star and phenix are developing detector upgrades providing drastic improvements in secondary vertex reconstruction which will allow the use of displaced vertex techniques to direct measure @xmath1 and @xmath6 mesons with high precision and efficiency .",
    "putting aside the discrepancies in the absolute cross sections measurements between star and phenix we now investigate how heavy quarks interact with the qgp formed in au+au  collisions at rhic . over the last few years",
    "rhic is providing interesting information on how the partons behave in such hot and dense medium .",
    "the study of flavor dependence of these interactions will further expand our knowledge about the properties of the nuclear matter under such extreme conditions .",
    "nuclear effects in non - photonic electron production are measured through the comparison of spectra from _ _",
    "d__+au  and au+au  collisions to the equivalent spectrum in : the relevant quantity is the ratio @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the differential yield in au+au  ( _ _ d__+au ) and @xmath29 the corresponding yield in  collisions .",
    "@xmath30 is the nuclear overlap integral , derived from glauber calculations @xcite . in the absence of nuclear effects , such as shadowing , cronin effect , or gluon saturation , hard processes are expected to scale with the number of binary collisions and hence , ( ) = 1 .",
    "figure [ fig_raa]-a shows the average  for high-  non - photonic electrons as a function of  for star and phenix data . despite the cross section discrepancies between star and phenix ,  results are consistent with each other . for non - photonic electrons",
    "shows an increasing suppression from peripheral to central au+au  collisions , indicating an unexpectedly energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium .",
    "this suppression is similar to the one observed for light - quark hadrons , indicated by the shaded area in the figure .",
    "for the 5% most central collisions , non - photonic electron production for @xmath31  is suppressed by a factor @xmath32 .",

    "figure [ fig_raa]-b also shows different theoretical predictions for the non - photonic electron suppression in central au+au  collisions considering different energy loss mechanisms . curves ( i ) and ( ii ) correspond to the expected heavy quark suppression when the energy loss mechanism is induced gluon radiation , considering electrons from @xmath1 and @xmath6 mesons decays . curve ( i ) corresponds to the average value of dvgl radiative energy loss calculation in which the medium gluon density is @xmath33 @xcite . in this case , the radiative energy loss does not account for the observed suppression , although the uncertainties , both in the data and theory , are large . on the other hand , curve ( ii )",
    "@xcite shows a larger suppression than curve ( i ) . in this case , however , the sensitivity of  to the time averaged transport coefficient @xmath34 becomes smaller as it increases .",
    "in fact , the variation in  for @xmath35 ( gev@xmath36/fm ) @xmath37 at @xmath38 gev / c is only @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this saturation of the suppression for high values of @xmath34 can be attributed to the highly opacity of the medium , biasing the particle production towards its surface .",
    "although gluon radiation is still expected to be a significant energy loss mechanism other processes may become important to describe the suppression observed in central au+au  collisions . curve ( iii ) is an average prediction for electrons from heavy - quark mesons decays and includes both dvgl radiative and elastic energy loss , as well as jet path length fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in contrast with light quarks , the elastic energy loss is comparable to the radiative for heavy quarks @xcite and the effect on  is significant . in fact , theoretical predictions for elastic rescattering of partons in the medium that can create resonant d and b meson states via quark coalescence @xcite in the medium can lead to a significant suppression at moderate as seen in curve ( iv ) . in this case",
    ", the amount of suppression depends on the resonance widths .",
    "other processes , such as in - medium fragmentation @xcite , shown in curve ( vi ) may also contribute to the observed suppression in central au+au  collisions .",
    "it is clear that the full understanding of the energy loss mechanisms is a fundamental milestone for the characterization of the medium properties .",
    "heavy flavors provide an important tool to investigate these mechanisms .",
    "it has been argued that the matter created in heavy - ion collisions at rhic is sufficiently hot and dense that charm quarks might thermalize in the medium @xcite . the most promising method to study",
    "this hypothesis is the measurement of charm elliptic flow .",
    "large elliptic flow for @xmath1-mesons would imply in a large number of interactions , enough to suggest thermalization .",
    "recent phenix results @xcite for non - photonic electron @xmath40 , shown in figure [ fig_raa]-c , suggest that charm quarks carry a substantial amount of @xmath40 .",
    "non - photonic electron @xmath40 at low-  is compatible with rescattering+resonances calculations suggesting a reduction in thermalization times of heavy quarks in the medium , when compared to pqcd scattering @xcite . at high-",
    "we notice a tendency of dropping in the non - photonic electron @xmath40 , although the statistical uncertainties are very large .",
    "this could be an indication of increasing dominance of electrons from bottom productions since bottom is not assumed to show a pronounced @xmath40 . more precise data and the independent measurement of @xmath1-meson @xmath40 is fundamental to understand @xmath40 in this  region .",
    "generally , all current models overpredict  at high- .",
    "it is important to note that in all calculations charm quarks are substantially more quenched than bottom quarks . curve ( v ) in figure [ fig_raa]-b , which is based only on electrons from @xmath1 decays describes the data best .",
    "it is the dominance of electrons from @xmath6 decays for @xmath41  that pushes the predicted  to higher values .",
    "all theoretical calculations use the relative contribution of @xmath1 and @xmath6 as predicted by pqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the observed suppression as well the observed @xmath40 of non - photonic electrons require independent measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath6 mesons at high- .",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 correlations in  collisions is a promising tool to measure this relative contribution . in general ,",
    "heavy flavors have harder fragmentation functions than gluons and light quarks , making the near side correlation ( @xmath44 ) more sensitive to the decay kinematics .",
    "figure [ figcorrel ] shows preliminary data from star on the relative contribution of charm and bottom to the non - photonic electron data .",
    "the relative contribution is obtained from the fit of the near side correlation with predictions for @xmath42 correlations for @xmath1 and @xmath6 mesons from pythia .",
    "experimental uncertainties contain the ones from photonic background removal ( dominant part ) and the choice of fit method .",
    "details of this analysis can be found in ref @xcite .",
    "the lines show fonll predictions for charm and bottom .",
    "the yellow band reflects the uncertainty in the calculation . within errors ,",
    "the experimental data is compatible with fonll calculations .",
    "this result , if confirmed , would imply that bottom may be more suppressed in central au+au  collisions than predicted by current energy loss calculations . in order to further investigate the relative contribution of charm and bottom to non - photonic electrons one may look for @xmath45-meson correlations at @xmath46 in collisions . because of the decay channels of @xmath1 and @xmath6 mesons the study of the charge dependence ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) of this correlations can help on the separation of electrons from @xmath49 and @xmath50 pairs .",
    "rhic is providing challenging data on heavy flavor production and its interplay with the medium .",
    "recent results show that this interaction with the medium is stronger than what we expected resulting in a large energy loss in central au+au  collisions . in order to take the next step it is imperative to independently measure nuclear modification factors and @xmath40 of @xmath1 and @xmath6 mesons",
    ". this will be possible in the near future when detector upgrades are available .",
    "detailed and systematic measurements are required to address existing discrepancies and are fundamental to our understanding of heavy flavor production at rhic .",
