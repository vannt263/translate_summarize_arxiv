    "the statistics of spacings measure the fine structure of sequences of real numbers , going beyond the classical weyl uniform distribution .",
    "originating in work of physicists on random matrices @xcite , spacing statistics are conveniently expressed as the convergence of certain measures , called level correlations , and respectively level spacing measures . in the past decades these notions have received significant attention in many areas of mathematical physics , analysis , probability , and number theory . for most sequences of interest",
    "it is usually very challenging to prove the existence and describe the limiting spacing measures , such as the gap distribution or pair correlation , even when their existence is experimentally predicted .",
    "one class of interesting sequences studied in recent years arises from the angular distribution of lattice points . in the euclidean scenery",
    "one such question is : for a given point @xmath6 , describe the statistics of the increasing sequence of finite sets @xmath7 representing the directions of points in the affine lattice @xmath8 with observer located at the origin . when @xmath9 the gap distribution of this sequence was proved by marklof and str \" ombergsson @xcite to coincide with the gap distribution of the sequence @xmath10 , previously computed by elkies and mcmullen @xcite . in this situation",
    "we are not aware of any result concerning the pair correlation for an individual @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath12 the limiting gap distribution was computed in @xcite .",
    "a major difference between the two situations is that the gap distribution density , always supported in @xmath13 , vanishes on @xmath14 $ ] when @xmath12 and is equal to @xmath15 on @xmath16 $ ] when @xmath17 .",
    "this kind of repulsion can be used to explicitly compute the pair correlation when @xmath18 .",
    "when the disk is replaced by the square @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] and one only considers primitive lattice points , the pair correlation was computed in @xcite .    in the hyperbolic situation ,",
    "the lattice @xmath20 is replaced with a lattice ( discrete subgroup of finite covolume ) @xmath1 in @xmath21 .",
    "we consider the angles between geodesic rays @xmath22 in the upper half plane @xmath23 , connecting a fixed point @xmath24 with the ( finitely many ) points @xmath25 in its @xmath1-orbit , lying in increasingly large hyperbolic balls .",
    "these angles are well - known to be uniformly distributed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and their uniform distribution in angular sectors can be made effective @xcite .",
    "a first step in the study of the pair correlation of directions of hyperbolic lattice points was completed in @xcite , where we treated the case @xmath5 and @xmath26 , establishing a formula for the pair correlation density @xmath27 that involves two terms .",
    "the first term is a series over the set of matrices @xmath28 with nonnegative entries of an explicit function of @xmath29 depending only on the hilbert - schmidt norm of @xmath28 , while the second term is a finite sum involving volumes of bodies defined in terms of the triangle transformation introduced in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the approach introduced in @xcite , conjecturing an explicit formula for the pair correlation density @xmath27 for arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath4 , and we prove the formula for the modular group and @xmath4 an elliptic point .",
    "remarkably , we find that @xmath27 equals the diagonal value at @xmath4 of an explicit automorphic kernel .    to state the results we introduce some notation and definitions .",
    "let @xmath30 and let @xmath1 be a discrete , finite covolume subgroup of @xmath2 . for @xmath31 , define @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the hyperbolic distance between two points @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the number of matrices @xmath31 in the ball @xmath36 , so that asymptotically @xmath37 .",
    "we are interested in the pair correlation density function @xmath38    the approach and computations from this paper provide evidence toward the following :    [ c1 ] let @xmath1 be a discrete subgroup of @xmath2 with fundamental domain of finite area @xmath39 .",
    "the pair correlation measure @xmath40 exists on @xmath13 , and is given by a @xmath41 function expressed as a series of three dimensional volumes .",
    "its density @xmath42 is given by the formula @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the continuous function defined for @xmath46 and @xmath47 by @xmath48    since the series above is absolutely convergent , by lhospital we also deduce the conjectural formula : @xmath49    for the elliptic points for @xmath50 we prove the conjecture , using extra symmetries of the hyperbolic lattices centered at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "[ t1 ] conjecture [ c1 ] and formula hold for @xmath5 and for @xmath4 one of the elliptic points @xmath51 or @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) .",
    "the conjecture has also been verified numerically for a few congruence subgroups @xmath55 and a few points @xmath4 . in figure",
    "[ figure1 ] , we compare the pair correlation function given by with the actual pair correlation function computed by counting the pairs in the definition , for @xmath5 and for a few choices of @xmath4 .",
    "to count the pairs @xmath56 in the definition of @xmath57 , we first reduce to a half ball @xmath58 as explained in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "when @xmath5 and @xmath0 is one of the elliptic points @xmath51 or respectively @xmath53 , each angle in the definition of @xmath57 is counted a number of times equal to the order of the stabilizer of @xmath0 in @xmath1 , namely 2 or respectively 3 times .",
    "therefore it is more natural to consider the pair correlation measure @xmath59 defined as @xmath60 with the condition @xmath61 replaced by @xmath62 .",
    "denoting by @xmath63 the corresponding pair correlation functions , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the cardinality of the stabilizer of @xmath4 , so that @xmath66 if @xmath0 is not an elliptic point . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the function @xmath63 is identical with the pair correlation function found in @xcite , but the formula here is entirely explicit for all @xmath29 .",
    "formula relates the pair correlation of hyperbolic lattice angles with the length spectrum of the lattice .",
    "for example , the spikes in the graphs in figure [ figure1 ] occur at values of @xmath29 related in a straightforward way to the length spectrum . assuming that lattices centered at different points in a half that the pair correlation functions for the lattices centered at @xmath4 and @xmath67 are equal . ]",
    "fundamental domain for @xmath68 have different length spectra , it would follow that the distribution of lattice angles determines the point @xmath4 in a half fundamental domain .",
    "a common feature of pair correlation density functions , encountered also for the pair correlation of farey fractions @xcite , is that they tend to one at infinity .",
    "we expect that the same is true for the function in conjecture [ c1 ] , namely that if @xmath1 is a fuchsian group of the first kind with fundamental domain of finite hyperbolic area @xmath39 , then @xmath69 where the function @xmath70 is defined in conjecture [ c1 ] .",
    "the standard way of proving an asymptotic formula such as is by using the spectral decomposition of the automorphic kernel @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , and we attempt to spectrally decompose the kernel @xmath73 in appendix [ sec11 ] .",
    "however , we encounter technical problems due to the fact that the kernel @xmath74 is not smooth at two points , and as a consequence we can only prove that its selberg - harish - chandra transform @xmath75 satisfies @xmath76 for real @xmath77 .",
    "this is an epsilon short of the decay @xmath78 for some @xmath79 , required for absolute convergence in the spectral decomposition of @xmath73 , and therefore we leave the proof of for later work .    for @xmath80 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the pair correlation function @xmath81 is the same as that of angles made by reciprocal geodesics on the modular surface , namely the closed geodesics passing through the projection of @xmath51 on the modular surface .",
    "reciprocal geodesics were first studied by fricke and klein @xcite , and more recently by sarnak @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ appendix ] we similarly describe the arithmetic and geometry of closed geodesics passing through the projection of @xmath53 on the modular surface .",
    "while reciprocal geodesics always consist of two loops , one tracing the other in the opposite direction , we show that a geodesic on the modular surface passing through the image of @xmath53 consists of one , two , or four closed loops .",
    "the precise situation depends on the arithmetic properties of the discriminant attached to the geodesic .",
    "we now sketch the main steps in the proof of theorem [ t1 ] , while also describing the organization of the paper . in the remaining of the introduction and throughout the paper we take @xmath80 , and keep @xmath4 mostly arbitrary . for technical reasons , we assume that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are rational . an important role is played by the set @xmath84 of matrices with nonnegative entries , distinct from the identity .    _ step 1 . _ as in @xcite , our approach is based on computing the pair correlation of the quantities @xmath85 by first approximating them with @xmath86 .",
    "the reason for preferring the function @xmath87 is explained by lemma [ l1 ] , where we show that @xmath88 with a function @xmath89 depending only on the lower row @xmath90 of @xmath91 . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we reduce to angles in the hyperbolic half balls for which @xmath92 , and we show in section [ sec4 ] that the sets @xmath93 and @xmath94 have the same pair correlation .",
    "_ to compute the pair correlation of @xmath94 , we estimate the number @xmath95 of pairs @xmath96 with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the cardinality of the set @xmath102 replacing @xmath103 in terms of @xmath104 , for @xmath105 we show that @xmath101 is asymptotic as @xmath106 to the cardinality @xmath107 of the set @xmath108 of integer triples @xmath109 such that @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 defined in .",
    "this approximation holds for fixed @xmath105 with an explicit error term ( lemma [ l11 ] ( iii ) ) , but in order to control the error when when summing the series we need to replace @xmath107 by the cardinality @xmath113 of the subset @xmath114 consisting of triples @xmath109 as above with @xmath115 .",
    "_ using estimates for number of points in hyperbolic regions based on bounds on kloosterman sums , we show in lemmas [ l14 ] and [ l15 ] that for @xmath105 , @xmath116 , and a similar estimate holds also when summing @xmath113 over @xmath105 .",
    "the region @xmath117 consists of triples @xmath118 \\times [ -\\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{v\\sqrt{k-|u| } } , \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{v\\sqrt{k-|u| } } ] \\times [ -k , k]$ ] for which @xmath119    _ step 4 . _",
    "using extra symmetries of the hyperbolic lattice in the case @xmath26 ( section [ sec8 ] ) and @xmath120 ( section [ sec10 ] ) , we show that the summation range in can be reduced to a subset of @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , using repulsion arguments involving the farey tessellation , we can define finite subsets @xmath121 such that for @xmath122 the quantities @xmath123 can be expressed only in terms of @xmath124 for appropriate @xmath125 .",
    "therefore we place ourselves in the situations analysed in steps 2 and 3 , obtaining @xmath126    _ step 5 . _",
    "the resulting volumes are expressed in closed form as integrals in section [ sec9 ] for @xmath4 arbitrary , and passing to the pair correlation function @xmath127 of the angles @xmath128 we obtain the formula in conjecture [ c1 ] , and finish the proof of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "the difficulty in proving conjecture [ c1 ] for @xmath80 and general @xmath4 resides in the estimates of steps 2 and 3 , where we use positivity of some of the entries of the matrices involved to obtain good control on the error in lattice point counting",
    ". it would be interesting to find a proof that involves the spectral theory of the hyperbolic laplacian .",
    "for the problem of equidistribution of the geodesic angles , such an approach is provided for example by the estimate for exponential sums in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) ( restated in a more transparent way in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) ) . for the pair correlation problem",
    "we would need a suitable extension of these results , instead of the lattice point counting arguments used in this paper .",
    "such an approach could potentially generalize to fuchsian groups of the first kind .",
