    "specifying the descent set of a permutation can be thought of as giving information on how the elements are ordered locally , namely , which pairs of consecutive elements are ordered properly and which are not , the latter constituting the descents . the original idea that became the starting point of this research was to generalize descent sets to indicators of relative orders of @xmath13-tuples of consecutive elements , the next simplest case being @xmath14 . in this case",
    "there are @xmath15 possible relative orders , and thus the analog of the descent set enumerator @xmath16 , also known as the @xmath9-index of the boolean algebra @xmath10 , would involve @xmath15 non - commuting variables . in order to defer overcomplication , to keep the number of variables at @xmath17 , and to stay close to classical permutation statistics , we can divide triples of consecutive elements into merely `` proper '' or `` improper '' , defined as having the relative order of an even or an odd permutation of size @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we call the improper triples _",
    "@xmath4-descents _ , and denote the set of positions at which @xmath4-descents occur in a permutation @xmath18 by @xmath19 .    computing the number of permutations with a given @xmath4-descent set @xmath20 yields a few immediate observations .",
    "for example , the number of permutations @xmath21 with  @xmath19 equal to a fixed subset @xmath22 $ ] is divisible by @xmath23 .",
    "this fact becomes clear upon the realization that @xmath19 is preserved when the elements of @xmath18 are cyclically shifted , so that @xmath24 becomes @xmath17 , @xmath17 becomes @xmath4 , and so on . as a result , it makes sense to focus on the set @xmath25 of permutations of @xmath26 $ ] with the first element equal to @xmath24 . a second",
    ", less trivial observation arising from early calculations is that the number of permutations in @xmath25 whose @xmath4-descent set is empty is the euler number @xmath27 .",
    "this second observation follows from the equidistribution of the statistic @xmath28 on the set @xmath29 with another variation on the descent set statistic , this time on @xmath30 , which we call the _ alternating descent set _ ( theorem [ bijection_alt3 ] ) .",
    "it is defined as the set of positions @xmath1 at which the permutation has an _ alternating descent _ , which is a regular descent if @xmath1 is odd or an ascent if @xmath1 is even .",
    "thus the alternating descent set @xmath31 of a permutation @xmath18 is the set of places where @xmath18 deviates from the alternating pattern .",
    "many of the results in this paper that were originally motivated by the generalized descent statistic @xmath32 are actually given in terms of the alternating descent statistic @xmath33 .",
    "we show that the alternating eulerian polynomials , defined as @xmath34 by analogy with the classical eulerian polynomials , have the generating function @xmath35 where @xmath36 , so that the difference with the classical formula ( [ des_inv_gf ] ) below ( specialized at @xmath37 ) is only in that the exponential function is replaced by tangent plus secant ( theorem [ final_f ] ) .",
    "a similar parallel becomes apparent in our consideration of the analog of the well known identity @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "given a formal power series @xmath40 , we define the symmetric function @xmath41 where @xmath42 runs over all compositions of @xmath23 , and @xmath43 then ( [ eulerian_identity ] ) can be written as @xmath44 and we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes setting the variables @xmath47 , @xmath48 ,  ,",
    "@xmath49 to @xmath24 and the remaining variables to @xmath50 ( proposition [ gfn_substitution ] ) .    in section [ cd - stuff ]",
    "we discuss the generating function @xmath51 for the number of permutations in @xmath30 with a given alternating descent set @xmath52 $ ] , denoted @xmath53 , which is analogous to the generating polynomial @xmath16 for the regular descent set statistic mentioned earlier .",
    "the polynomial @xmath16 can be expressed as the @xmath54-index @xmath55 of the boolean algebra @xmath10 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we show that @xmath58 can also be written in terms of  @xmath59 and @xmath60 as @xmath61 ( proposition [ hat_phi ] ) , and that the sum of absolute values of the coefficients of this @xmath62-polynomial , which is the evaluation @xmath63 , is the @xmath23-th term of a notable combinatorial sequence counting permutations in @xmath30 with no consecutive descents and no descent at the end ( theorem [ sum_coefficients ] ) .",
    "this sequence has properties relevant to this work ; in particular , the logarithm of the corresponding exponential generating function is an odd function , which is a crucial property of both @xmath64 and @xmath65 that emerges repeatedly in the derivations of the results mentioned above .",
    "we discuss the similarities with euler numbers and alternating permutations in section [ swg_permutations ] .",
    "it is natural to wonder if the variations of descents introduced thus far can be accompanied by corresponding variations of inversions . for alternating descents",
    "it seems reasonable to consider _ alternating inversions _ defined in a similar manner as pairs of indices @xmath66 such that either @xmath1 is odd and the elements in positions @xmath1 and @xmath67 form a regular inversion , or else @xmath1 is even and these two elements do _ not _ form a regular inversion . as for @xmath4-descents ,",
    "we define the accompanying _ @xmath4-inversion statistic _ , where a @xmath4-inversion is defined as the number of pairs of indices @xmath68 such that @xmath69 and the elements in positions @xmath1 , @xmath70 , and @xmath67 , taken in this order , constitute an odd permutation of size @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 be the number of alternating inversions and @xmath4-inversions of a permutation @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "we find that the joint distribution of the pair @xmath73 of statistics on the set @xmath30 is identical to the distribution of the pair  @xmath74 of statistics on the set @xmath29 ( theorem [ main_bivariate_identity ] ) .",
    "stanley @xcite derived a generating function for the joint distribution of the classical descent and inversion statistics on @xmath30 : @xmath75_q ! } = { 1-t\\over \\operatorname{exp}_q\\bigl(u(t-1)\\bigr ) - t},\\ ] ] where @xmath76_q!$ ] , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the number of descents and inversions of @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "( another good reference on the subject is a recent paper @xcite of shareshian and wachs . )",
    "it would be nice to produce an analog of the generating function ( [ des_inv_gf ] ) for these descent - inversion pairs , but this task appears to be challenging , and it is not even clear what form such a generating function should have , as the @xmath11-factorials in the denominators of ( [ des_inv_gf ] ) are strongly connected to @xmath11-binomial coefficients , which have a combinatorial interpretation of the number of inversions in a permutation obtained by concatenating two increasing runs of fixed size .",
    "nevertheless the bivariate polynomial @xmath79 seems to be of interest , and in section [ euler - q - analog ] we direct our attention to the @xmath11-polynomials that result if we set @xmath80 .",
    "this special case concerns up - down permutations and , more precisely , their distribution according to the number of alternating inversions . for",
    "down - up permutations this distribution is essentially the same , the only difference being the order of the coefficients in the @xmath11-polynomial , and for our purposes it turns out to be more convenient to work with down - up permutations , so we use the distribution of @xmath81 on them to define a @xmath11-analog @xmath82 of euler numbers .",
    "the formal definition we give is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the set of down - up permutations of @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the polynomial @xmath82 is monic with constant term equal to the catalan number @xmath85 ( proposition [ hateq_facts ] ) , which hints at the possibility to express @xmath82 as the sum of @xmath85 `` nice '' polynomials with constant term @xmath24 .",
    "we discover such an expression in the form of a @xmath11-analog of a beautiful identity that represents @xmath12 as the sum of weighted dyck paths of length  @xmath86 . in this identity",
    "we imagine dyck paths as starting at @xmath87 and ending at @xmath88 .",
    "we set the weight of an up - step to be the level at which that step is situated ( the steps that touch the `` ground '' are at level @xmath24 , the steps above them at level @xmath17 , and so on ) and the weight of a down - step to be either the level of the step ( for even @xmath23 ) or one plus the level of the step ( for odd @xmath23 ) .",
    "we set the weight of the path to be the product of the weights of all its steps .",
    "the sum of the weights taken over all @xmath89 paths then equals @xmath12 , and if we replace the weight of a step with the @xmath11-analog of the respective integer , we obtain @xmath82 ( theorem [ weighted_path_identity ] ) .",
    "the original @xmath37 version of the above identity provides a curious connection between catalan and euler numbers .",
    "a notable difference between these numbers is in the generating functions : one traditionally considers the ordinary generating function for the former and the exponential one for the latter .",
    "an interesting and hopefully solvable problem is to find a generating function interpolating between the two , and a potential solution could be to use the above @xmath11-analog @xmath82 of euler numbers to write @xmath90_q!},\\ ] ] so that @xmath91 and @xmath92",
