    "bibliographic databases play nowadays a crucial role in modern science .",
    "citation numbers , or other measures derived from bibliographic data , are commonly used as quantitative indicators for the impact of research activities .",
    "citation analysis has been criticized  @xcite , and the true meaning of a citation can be very different from context to context  @xcite . despite these objections , the use of citations is widespread and citation numbers are currently and frequently used for assessing the impact of individual scholars  @xcite , journals  @xcite , departments  @xcite , universities and institutions  @xcite . especially at the level of individual scientists , numerical indicators based on citation counts",
    "are evaluation tools of fundamental importance for decisions about hiring  @xcite and/or grant awards  @xcite .    though widely used , numerical indicators based on citation numbers are generally poorly understood  @xcite . even in the basic case of citation distributions of papers ,",
    "where data are easily collectable and analyzable , there is no clear general picture .",
    "depending on the study performed and the data set analyzed , citation distributions have been judged compatible with several possible statistical distributions : power - law functions  @xcite , log - normal distributions  @xcite , stretched exponentials  @xcite , and others . at the same time , however , while researchers have not yet reached an agreement on the precise law governing citation distributions , interesting properties in citation data are nevertheless visible and detectable  @xcite .",
    "+ up to now , large - scale statistical analyses have been limited to the study of citations accumulated by papers @xcite or journals  @xcite . in these cases",
    "data are easily collected from the main bibliographic databases available on the market and do not require special filtering procedures .",
    "conversely , the collection of bibliographic data about individual scholars is much more difficult .",
    "simple searches on bibliographic databases are generally unable to produce clean data sets because of evident problems related to the proper disambiguation of scientists .",
    "all studies conducted so far have been therefore limited either to small sets of scientists  @xcite , or to data sets subjected to disambiguation problems  @xcite . + here , we take advantage of a data set composed of more than @xmath0 [ about two orders of magnitude larger than those used by  @xcite ] individual scientific profiles . the data set",
    "is rather clean because profiles are directly managed by scientists themselves , who are interested in providing correct information about the outcome of their research activity .",
    "we perform an initial exploratory analysis of this data set , and show that the main basic quantities used in research evaluation exercises obey well - defined statistical distributions .",
    "we then use the data set to investigate ( on a scale more than 10 times larger than previous studies ) the relation between the @xmath1-index and other simple bibliometric indicators .",
    "we collected the scientific profiles of @xmath2 scientists from google scholar citations ( gsc , scholar.google.com/citations ) database .",
    "the profile of each scholar reports the entire publication record of the scientist , including the year of publication and the number of citations accumulated by each publication according to the google scholar database [ for studies about differences in the quantification of bibliometric indicators of individual scientists between google scholar and other popular bibliographic databases see  @xcite ] .",
    "the profile is owned and managed by scientists themselves , who can delete and add publications , even merge two publications if considered initially as different in the database , and thus provides a clean source of information .",
    "scientists are requested to validate their profile by providing their academic email address .",
    "this validation ensures that the profile is actually managed by the scientist .",
    "finally , each scientist is required to provide a set of keywords which identify the research fields in which the scientist is active .",
    "+ data have been collected between june 29 and july 4 , 2012 .",
    "number of publications and citations reflect therefore the research activity performed until that time .",
    "we used an iterative procedure consisting in downloading the entire set of authors using an initial keyword ( we used `` network science '' ) , adding the other keywords used by these scientists , downloading the profile of new scientists that are using these new keywords , and so on , until we were able to discover neither new scientists nor new keywords . in total , we were able to identify @xmath3 different keywords ( see fig .  1 for a word cloud of the most common keywords ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the database is in rapid evolution and growth .",
    "for example , we used the same procedure described above to download data in march 2012 , and at that time the data set was composed of @xmath4 scientists and @xmath5 keywords .    in order to be sure about the information provided by users ,",
    "have a better control of the publication record of individual scientists , and include only scholars with a sufficiently long period of activity and sufficiently large number of publications , we filter the data set with the following restrictions :    1 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the @xmath6 scientists who validated their profile with an academic email .",
    "we delete from the data set publications that were published before year @xmath7 .",
    "this was necessary in order to exclude from the data set papers whose year of publication is wrong in gcs .",
    "note also that scientists with first publication before year @xmath7 , if still active and with a validated profile , would have academic ages longer than @xmath8 years .",
    "we further restrict the attention to scientists with at least @xmath9 publications and career length longer than or equal to @xmath10 years ( the academic age or career length is measured as the difference between the publication years of the first paper of a scholar and year @xmath11 ) .    in the rest of the paper , we will present the result of the analysis based on a total of @xmath12 scholars whose research profile satisfies the aforementioned conditions .",
    "we first investigate general properties of the population in our data set . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a , we show the composition of the population in terms of academic age .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath13 of the career length @xmath14 can be reasonably well described ( by graphical inspection , although the measured @xmath15-value does not support a good statistical compatibility ) by a log - normal distribution @xmath16 ^ 2 / \\left(2 \\sigma^2\\right ) } \\;\\ ; ,    \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] and the best estimate of parameters ( obtained with least square fit ) of the distribution are @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the suffix @xmath14 is used to indicate that the parameters have been calculated for the academic age @xmath14 ) .",
    "+ the number of citations @xmath19 received by each scientist ( @xmath19 is the sum of all citations accumulated by all papers written by an author ) is well fitted by ( see fig .  [",
    "fig:1]b ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and the best estimates of the parameters are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "[ eq:2 ] is a generalization to the logarithms of the well - known gumbel function that usually appears in the description of the statistics of extreme values .    in figs .",
    "[ fig:1]c and d , we report the pdfs of the number of publications @xmath24 and the @xmath1-index , respectively . in these cases , we tried to fit the distributions with both eqs .",
    "[ eq:1 ] and  [ eq:2 ] , but none of them was able to describe entirely the pdfs obtained with data .",
    "it is , however , interesting to note that the pdf of the number of publications per author is neither a strict decreasing function nor a power - law function as often assumed in the literature  @xcite , but instead the pdf in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c shows a clear peak and a decay faster than a power - law at large values of @xmath24 .",
    "+ in general , the results presented in fig .  [ fig:1 ] depend on the choices we made in the selection of the authors .",
    "for example , the peak position of the @xmath25 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ] moves from @xmath26 to @xmath27 if we remove the restriction on the minimal number of publications needed to enter in the sample .",
    "similar considerations are also valid for the other pdfs . on the other hand",
    ", our choices do not affect the tail of the pdfs , and more generally their shapes .",
    "for example , even if the peak moves to lower values when we include all authors in the data set , the pdf of fig .  [ fig:1]a still can be reasonably well described by a log - normal distribution .                  in this subsection",
    "we test empirically some relations between the @xmath1-index and other bibliometric indicators , which have been proposed in the literature .    already in his original paper , hirsch himself presented a very simple model for the accumulation of citations , which implies a correlation between the @xmath1-index and the total number @xmath19 of citations received by an individual @xmath28 with exponent @xmath29 .",
    "a correlation of this type between @xmath1 and @xmath19 has been verified empirically for small data sets  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a we plot , for each author in our data set , the @xmath1-index _ vs. _ the number of citations accrued @xmath19 , in log - log scale .",
    "the correlation is rather strong ( linear correlation coefficient measured in log - log scale @xmath30 ) supporting the hypothesis of a scaling relationship between these two quantities . since we are interested in finding the scaling between @xmath1 and @xmath19 that would provide the strongest relation between them , we determine the best estimate of @xmath31 as the one that produces the most localized distribution of the ratio @xmath32 .",
    "we quantify the localization of the distribution of @xmath33 by means of the so - called coefficient of variation @xmath34 , i.e. , the ratio between the standard deviation and the average value of @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the best estimate of the power - law exponent in eq .",
    "[ h_vs_c ] is obtained as the value of @xmath35 that minimizes the coefficient of variation .",
    "this way , we find @xmath36 ( see fig .  [ fig:2]a ) , which is quite close to hirsch s original prediction . as additional fitting procedures",
    ", we also calculated the best estimate of @xmath35 as the one minimizing the kurtorsis of the distribution of @xmath33 , or the one minimizing the mean square displacement @xmath37 , where the sum runs over all authors in the data set and @xmath38 is an additional fitting parameter . in all cases , we find similar values for the best estimate of @xmath35 .    to further characterize the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath19 , we study the statistical properties of the quantity @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b .",
    "we find that the distribution is narrowly peaked around a value close to 1 , and that can be nicely fitted by the log - gumbel distribution of eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] whose best parameter estimates are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the relation reported in eq .",
    "[ h_vs_c ] between @xmath1 and @xmath19 can be easily derived  @xcite assuming that the distribution of the number of citations accrued by the publications of a single author is a power - law @xmath42 ( @xmath43 being a normalization constant ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath44 found numerically implies a distribution @xmath45 decaying with an exponent slightly larger than 2 .",
    "if the distribution is a perfect power - law and @xmath46 , the same power - law relation also holds between @xmath1 and the total number of publications @xmath24",
    "@xcite : @xmath47 .",
    "since the distribution @xmath45 is not a perfect power - law over the whole range of @xmath48 values , it is worth checking empirically the validity of such a power - law relationship , by allowing the scaling exponent to be possibly different from @xmath49 @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a we find that @xmath1 and @xmath24 are correlated ( @xmath51 ) , although less than in the previous case .",
    "the best estimate for the exponent , again obtained by minimizing the coefficient of variation , is @xmath52 .",
    "notice that this value indicates that @xmath1 depends differently on @xmath19 and on @xmath24 , thus contradicting the hypothesis that @xmath45 is , for all scholars , a pure power - law over its whole range . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b we plot the pdf of the quantity @xmath53 , which is approximately fitted by a log - normal distribution with parameters values @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "also in this case we find quite a narrow distribution , but the value of the coefficient of variation indicates a worse agreement with data with respect to one found for @xmath1 _ vs. _ @xmath19 . indeed , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a shows that the minimum coefficient of variation ( corresponding to @xmath56 ) is around 0.19 , while the minimum in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a is around 0.45 .",
    "+ under the power - law assumption for @xmath45 , it is also possible to express @xmath1 as a function of both @xmath24 and the average number of citations per paper @xmath57 , obtaining  @xcite @xmath58 minimizing the coefficient of variation for the quantity @xmath59 , we determine the best estimate of @xmath60 as @xmath61 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a ) , implying @xmath62 . in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a we plot , for each author , @xmath1 _ vs. _ @xmath63 finding a good agreement with the expected linear behavior . also in this case we find that the quantities are correlated ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the pdf of the rescaled index @xmath65 is well peaked ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b ) , and the distribution can be reasonably well fitted by a log - gumbel distribution with best - fit parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    as the relation @xmath68 shows",
    ", the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath19 is much stronger than the one on @xmath24 .",
    "the comparison between the minimum coefficients of variation measured for the three scaling assumptions ( eqs .",
    "[ h_vs_c ] ,  [ h_vs_n ] and  [ eq : final ] ) indicates that allowing for a dependence on both @xmath19 and @xmath24 leads only to a marginal improvement over considering only the dependence on @xmath19 ( the coefficient of variation changes only from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) while a dependence only on @xmath24 performs definitely worse .",
    "the presence of a term dependent on @xmath24 in eq .",
    "[ eq : final ] brings only a little improvement and leaves the exponent of the dependence on @xmath19 practically unaltered ( @xmath71 _ vs. _ @xmath72 ) .",
    "statistical analysis of bibliometric indicators devoted to the evaluation of individual scholars is usually difficult because of the lack of large and clean data sets describing accurately the publication records of researchers .",
    "this is a general problem that regards every bibliographic database available on the market , and is also the main reason for which the studies performed so far on the characterization of the bibliographic profile of individual scientists have been rarely based on more than @xmath73 individuals . in recent years , however , some main bibliographic databases have started to allow individual scientists to freely manage their publication profiles with specially designed on - line tools .",
    "this is the case of the recently created researcherid by thomson reuters ( http://www.researcherid.com ) , mendeley profiles ( http://www.mendeley.com ) and also of google scholar citations + ( scholar.google.com/citations ) . in all these online administration systems , scholars manage directly their profiles by adding , deleting and correcting their publication records , and thus the information provided can be considered accurate because it is in the interest of researchers to provide an accurate and up - to - date source of information regarding their research production . + here , we took advantage of the entire data set of google scholar citations as of june 29 , 2012 .",
    "the data set is composed of more than @xmath0 individual scholars working in research institutions worldwide . although google scholar citations represents a relatively clean set of data describing the academic records of individual researchers , it is important to stress that our set of data does not represent a random sample of researchers because the presence of a researcher in the system is subjected to various types of factors that , as a matter of fact , bias the sample .",
    "first , our data set is mainly composed of relatively young scientists ( fig .",
    "2a ) who are able to create a profile , validate it with their email , and manage it .",
    "second , the profiles that compose the data set are certainly those of scholars who want to promote their research with the use of modern information - technology tools . finally , although the scientists present in our data set have various fields of expertise , some scientific disciplines are clearly over - represented and others underrepresented ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we would like to further emphasize that the entire data set analyzed here is clearly subjected to all the limitations of the google scholar database ( eventual presence of fake publications , duplication of citations , etc . )",
    "that have been deeply studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "+ taking into account the formerly mentioned limitations of our data set , here we provided an exploratory analysis on some basic statistics for single authors and focus in some detail on the relation between the @xmath1-index , the number of publications and the number of citations of individual scientists .",
    "we found three main results :    1 .",
    "the @xmath1-index @xmath1 is strongly correlated with the total number of citations @xmath19 received by a scientist with his / her own scientific production . in particular , we find @xmath74 in qualitative agreement with the early hypothesis by hirsch  @xcite validated empirically on small data sets  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-index is also shown to be correlated with the number of publications @xmath24 , but this relation is much less precise than the one observed for @xmath19 .",
    "it is possible to combine both dependencies into a single power - law relation @xmath62 .",
    "this law , however , provides only a slight improvement with respect to the power - law relation that connects only @xmath1 and @xmath19 .",
    "our results represent a large - scale validation of formerly postulated conjectures . while the exact values of the measured power - law exponents might be data set dependent , we believe that the main message has a validity that goes beyond the data analyzed here : the total number of citations @xmath19 received by a scientist can be used as a effective proxy of his / her @xmath1-index .    the fact that @xmath1 is strongly correlated with @xmath19 and much more weakly with the total number of publications @xmath24 is evidence that the distribution @xmath45 of citations accrued by publications of a single researcher is not a pure power - law over its whole range .",
    "please note that we do not exclude the possibility that this fact is a consequence of the sample used in our analysis , where scholars have academic age typically shorter than the one of an average researcher and thus individual citation distributions may have not yet reached as sufficient level of stationarity .",
    "our results , however , call for more work to better characterize and understand the activity and citations profile of individual scholars , their common features and their variations .",
    "the large data set provided by google scholar citations constitutes an ideal tool for this endeavor .",
