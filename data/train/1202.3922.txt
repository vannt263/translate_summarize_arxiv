    "a candidate for the superspace extension of the macdonald polynomials  macdonald superpolynomials for short  has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "such an extension involves the anticommuting variables @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) as well as the usual commuting variables @xmath4 the superspace approach turns out to be a very restrictive framework : each variable @xmath5 is considered to be paired with an anticommuting variable @xmath6 , so that symmetric superpolynomials are required to be invariant under the interchange of pairs @xmath7 @xcite .    the construction in @xcite is presented as a conjecture ( a point developed shortly ) .",
    "but the first exploration of the resulting superpolynomials revealed a very rich structure . as expected , this two - parameter @xmath1 family of superpolynomials contains , in the appropriate limit ( @xmath8 ) , the jack superpolynomials @xcite .",
    "but , what was totally unexpected a priori , is that it contains two versions of the hall - littlewood superpolynomials ( for @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "moreover , from each version of the latter , we can define a natural extension of the schur polynomials ( for @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively ) .",
    "both types of schurs have a positive integral decomposition into the monomial superpolynomials ( a property that is not verified for the jack superpolynomials at @xmath13 ) .",
    "but what is more remarkable is that , using the @xmath14 schurs , we could conjecture a generalization of the macdonald positivity conjecture ( reviewed below ) .    the present article ,",
    "although completely independent , is a continuation of our previous work @xcite .",
    "it addresses the following issues : the existence of the macdonald superpolynomials , their relation with the non - symmetric macdonald polynomials and their characterization as an eigenvalue problem . as an aside",
    ", new conjectures for the kostka coefficients are presented .",
    "the conjectural construction of @xcite is proved here to be a valid characterization of the macdonald polynomials in superspace . to clarify this point , we first recall the definition of the ordinary macdonald polynomials @xcite .",
    "the macdonald polynomials @xmath15 , in the variables @xmath16 , are characterized by the two conditions @xmath17 the triangular decomposition refers to the usual dominance order on partitions ( see below ) and the @xmath18 s are the monomial symmetric functions .",
    "the orthogonality relation is defined in the power - sum basis @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , as @xmath21 @xmath22 being the number of parts in @xmath23 equal to @xmath24 . since the dominance ordering is partial ( for degrees @xmath25 )",
    ", the orthogonality constraint leads to an overdetermined system at each degree @xmath25 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to show that there exists such a family of polynomials .",
    "this is generally done through an eigenvalue - problem characterization .",
    "the brute - force approach followed in @xcite was to look for a suitable deformation of the scalar product that allows for nontrivial solutions to these systems . in this way , a candidate scalar product was identified and a large number of macdonald superpolynomials were constructed .",
    "the correctness of the construction was corroborated by various conjectural properties that provide natural extensions to superspace of classical results on macdonald polynomials .",
    "however , establishing the existence of the macdonald superpolynomials remained an open problem , the corresponding eigenvalue problem being still missing .",
    "the existence issue is resolved here : it is demonstrated that the superspace extension of the criteria has a solution .",
    "this is our main result ( the notation that follows is explained in full detail in section [ sps ] ) .",
    "[ theo1 ] given a superpartition @xmath26 of fermionic degree @xmath27 , there is a unique symmetric superpolynomial @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , such that : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a monomial superpolynomial and where lower terms refer to the dominance ordering on superpartitions ( see ( [ eqorder1 ] ) ) .",
    "the scalar product is defined by @xmath33where@xmath34      the existence proof proceeds indirectly , via an alternative definition of the macdonald superpolynomials , this one relying on a suitable ( anti)symmetrization of the non - symmetric macdonald polynomials .",
    "such a construction is akin to that of the jack superpolynomials in terms of the non - symmetric polynomials worked out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "however , the present construction turns out to be trickier than in the jack case .",
    "indeed , macdonal polynomials with prescribed symmetry  a priori , expected building blocks  are obtained by @xmath35-(anti)symmetrization of some subset of variables , where the role of symmetric group is played by the hecke algebra @xcite . however , anticommuting variable can not be @xmath35-antisymmetrized , and the construction has to incorporate both the usual antisymmetrization and the @xmath35-symmetrization , the two operations being applied to distinct set of variables .",
    "this is made explicit in eq . .",
    "this definition of the macdonald superpolynomials in terms of non - symmetric macdonald polynomials is a crucial step toward the characterization of the former in terms of an eigenvalue problem .",
    "recall that these non - symmetric polynomials are eigenfunctions of the cherednik operators @xcite . the mere symmetrization procedure that defines the macdonald superpolynomials",
    "indicates how to dress symmetric combinations of the cherednik operators in order to generate operators whose eigenfunctions are the macdonal superpolynomials . because we have two sets of variables ( commuting and anticommuting ) , we need two families of commuting operators to obtain a non - degenerate eigenvalue characterization ( see e.g. @xcite for the jack case ) .",
    "we thereby construct two generating functions of commuting operators .",
    "these are the natural extension of the sekiguchi operators characterizing the jack superpolynomials and introduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) . to fully characterize the eigenvalue problem , it is sufficient to consider the simplest representative of each family .",
    "the proof of the existence of the superpolynomials defined by the two conditions in theorem [ theo1 ] proceeds along standard arguments . but a crucial and difficult result that needs to be established is the self - adjoint property of the two eigenoperators .",
    "the outline of this proof was provided to us by alain lascoux @xcite .",
    "the relationship between macdonald superpolynomials and the non - symmetric polynomials has a further direct consequence : it implies a second orthogonality relation , where in this case , the scalar product is a constant - term expression .",
    "we show that when the number of variables tends to infinity , the norm calculated from the constant - term scalar product is equal ( up to a @xmath0-power ) to the norm , conjectured in @xcite , with respect to the scalar product defined in theorem [ theo1 ] .",
    "the outline of the article is the following . in section [ sps ]",
    ", we recall some basic definitions related to superpolynomials and superpartitions .",
    "section [ nons ] is also devoted to a review of known results , here pertaining to non - symmetric macdonald polynomials .",
    "the definition of the macdonald superpolynomials in terms of non - symmetric macdonald polynomials is presented in section [ smac ] . in section [ 2com ]",
    "we introduce two generating functions for commuting operators and show that they have the macdonald superpolynomials as their common eigenfunctions .",
    "this eigenfunction characterization allows us to demonstrate in section [ tri ] that the macdonald superpolynomials have a triangular decomposition in the monomial basis . in preparation for the orthogonality proof ,",
    "the eigenvalue problem defining the macdonald superpolynomials is simplified in section [ simp ] , where it is shown to be sufficient to consider two eigenoperators to get a non - degenerate characterization .",
    "the proof of the orthogonality with respect to the scalar product , which solves the existence issue in theorem  [ theo1 ] , is worked out in section [ ortho ] . at first , the problem is reformulated in terms of action of the two eigenoperators on the kernel .",
    "the long proof of the self - adjoint property of the macdonald - type operators is worked out in section [ self ] . as a natural extension of these orthogonality results ,",
    "a non - trivial duality relation is established in section [ dual ] . given this , all the tools for the demonstration of the evaluation and norm conjectures of @xcite are available , proof that would follow that in @xcite for the jack superpolynomials .",
    "finally , a second orthogonality relation is demonstrated in section [ asp ] .",
    "the corresponding norm is evaluated , and shown to be equal , up to a power of @xmath0 , to the conjectural norm of the macdonald superpolynomials with respect to the original scalar product . the combinatorial identity on which this claim relies",
    "is demonstrated in the appendix .",
    "the last section ( section [ kos ] ) , devoted to the generalized kostka coefficients , is somewhat off the streamline of this article but should be viewed in the context of the continuation of @xcite .",
    "the superspace version of the macdonald positivity conjecture is recalled in section [ gkos ] .",
    "two symmetry properties of the generalized kostka coefficients are presented .",
    "although these are rather direct extensions of the usual symmetry relations given in @xcite , one of these involve a new combinatorial number that is specific to superpartitions .",
    "this new data illustrates well the kind of novelties brought in by the introduction of anticommuting variables and the richness of the combinatorics of superpartitions .",
    "tables of kostka coefficients are appended to this section .",
    "two new conjectures concerning the kostka coefficients are given in section [ 2new ] .",
    "both results exhibit a different relationship between the @xmath1-kostka coefficients in the @xmath36 sector with the ordinary ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) @xmath1-kostka coefficients .",
    "in particular , conjecture [ kos1 ] expresses the usual @xmath1-kostka coefficients for partitions of degree @xmath38 as a sum of @xmath1-kostka coefficients for superpartitions of degree @xmath39 and @xmath36 . in other words ,",
    "the super - version of the macdonald positivity conjecture provides a refinement of the usual ones .",
    "let us digress briefly and point out that this result naturally poses the question : to which extent could we get information on the usual @xmath1-kostka coefficients from the perspective of the macdonald superpolynomials ?",
    "we intend to investigate this point elsewhere from a particular angle .",
    "such a connexion , at this stage , could rightly be called `` science fiction and macdonald s superpolynomials '' @xcite .",
    "a polynomial in superspace , or equivalently , a superpolynomial , is a polynomial in the usual @xmath40 variables @xmath41 and the @xmath40 anticommuting variables @xmath42 over a certain field , which will be taken throughout this article to be @xmath43 . a superpolynomial @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , is said to be symmetric if @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 the space of symmetric superpolynomials in @xmath40 variables over the field @xmath43 will be denoted @xmath49 , and its inverse limit by @xmath50 ( loosely speaking , the number of variables is considered infinite in @xmath50 ) .",
