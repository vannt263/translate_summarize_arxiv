    "hydroxyl ( oh ) masers are an excellent tool for probing the environment of massive star - forming regions ( sfrs )",
    ". they are bright and easily observable and act as point tracers of the local velocity and magnetic fields , owing to their large zeeman splitting coefficient . for the ground - state @xmath0 transitions ,",
    "the zeeman splitting coefficient is as large as 0.59 km  s@xmath1  mg@xmath1 . for a typical maser linewidth of 0.3 km  s@xmath1 ,",
    "a milligauss - strength magnetic field is sufficient to cleanly separate zeeman components of the 1665 mhz transition , and even fields as weak as several hundred microgauss can be detected .",
    "in addition , the sense of the splitting indicates the projected line - of - sight magnetic field orientation .",
    "@xcite first hypothesized that a connection exists between magnetic field directions obtained from molecular zeeman splitting and a large - scale galactic magnetic field .",
    "he found that eight oh maser sources ( and several clouds ) mostly near the solar circle with observable zeeman splitting displayed magnetic fields aligned in the clockwise direction when viewed from the north galactic pole .",
    "@xcite conducted a literature search and found a total of 17 reliable oh maser sources with detectable zeeman pairs in the @xmath2 transitions .",
    "of these 17 , 14 had line - of - sight field directions consistent with an overall clockwise galactic field . in the largest survey to date ,",
    "@xcite extended this dataset to include a total of 46 sources with zeeman pairs in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions of oh . excluding the galactic center , they found 28 sources consistent with a clockwise magnetic field and 17 sources consistent with a counterclockwise field .",
    "* henceforth paper i ) conducted a survey of 91 interstellar regions with known @xmath2 oh maser emission .",
    "they identified and mapped maser spots in the regions . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of paper i by identifying zeeman pairs toward massive sfrs , many of which contain ultracompact ( uc ) regions .",
    "we also investigate whether or not the magnetic fields deduced from oh zeeman splitting around massive sfrs are related to the large - scale magnetic field of the galaxy .",
    "a total of 91 maser sources were observed by paper i with the a configuration of the national radio astronomy observatory s very large array in socorro , nm .",
    "all sources were observed in both left- and right - circular polarization in at least one main - line @xmath2 18  cm oh transition ( 1665.4018 and 1667.3590  mhz ) , and some were also observed in one or both of the satellite - line transitions ( 1612.2310 and 1720.5300  mhz ) .",
    "the 0.763  khz spectral channel separation used corresponds to a velocity separation of 0.14  km  s@xmath1  for the main - line transitions ( fwhm @xmath5 larger ) .",
    "further details of the observations can be found in paper i.",
    "in the presence of a magnetic field , the degeneracy of the magnetic sublevels of the oh molecule is broken .",
    "for any given hyperfine transition , this results in three or more spectral lines with differing polarization properties  the zeeman effect ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "oh masers often display pairs of strong left and right elliptically polarized @xmath6-components . for reasons that are not well understood , purely linearly",
    "polarized @xmath7-components are rarely , if ever , detected .",
    "the task of identifiying zeeman pairs  two oppositely elliptically polarized lines at the same position on the sky  is relatively simple , provided one has sufficient angular resolution to resolve maser clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , with the vla one can only achieve an angular resolution of @xmath8  arcsec for the oh transitions at wavelengths of 18  cm .",
    "were the emission in any spectral channel to come from only one ( unresolved ) spot on the sky , this would not be a significant limitation .",
    "however , in reality the emission in any given spectral channel can come from spectral blends of masers at different positions in the source separated by less than the beam size .",
    "thus , great care must be taken to determine zeeman pairs from the paper i data .    in order to identify zeeman pairs , a modified version of the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) task jmfit",
    "was used to identify the brightest maser emission spot in each spectral channel ( velocity plane ) for any given source .",
    "a maser line was identified when emission was seen from approximately the same position in at least three adjacent velocity channels , with the strongest emission not found on the edge channels .",
    "this resulted in a large data set that could be automatically searched for zeeman pairs .",
    "ideally , one would like to find zeeman pairs in which the oppositely circularly polarized components were coincident on the sky to better than their apparent spot sizes .",
    "however , @xcite showed that oh masers in w3(oh ) clustered on a scale of @xmath9  cm ( @xmath10 at 2.2  kpc ; distances are discussed in  [ distances ] and listed in table [ pairs_tab ] ) and that oppositely circularly polarized maser lines within a cluster gave reliable magnetic field measurements when interpreted as zeeman pairs .",
    "thus , we searched for oppositely circularly polarized maser lines with projected positions separated by less than @xmath9  cm .",
    "while the main - line 1.6  ghz @xmath6-components are in general _ elliptically _ polarized , it is almost functionally equivalent to treat them as being _ circularly _ polarized for the purposes of right - circular polarization ( rcp ) and left - circular polarization ( lcp ) vla data .",
    "the caveat is that , for example , a right - elliptically polarized maser component , being the sum of circularly and linearly polarized emission , may appear in _ both _ rcp and lcp data at the same velocity , although the lcp emission will be much weaker , as the lcp feed is sensitive to only half of the ( presumed small ) linear component of the full elliptical polarization .",
    "some zeeman pairs consisted of single rcp and lcp lines that were coincident on the sky to better than @xmath9  cm .",
    "we consider these easily recognizable and reliable zeeman pairs .",
    "however , more than one maser line in the same polarization would often be seen within the assumed @xmath11  cm clustering length , such that it was unclear which should be paired with the maser spot in the other polarization .",
    "while such data are insufficient to make an unambiguous zeeman pair identification in all such cases , sometimes corroborating evidence from another maser transition ( or occasionally even the same transition ) in the same spatial region allowed the identification of zeeman pairs .",
    "in other cases , the line - of - sight field direction was deducible , even if unambiguous identification of a zeeman pair was not possible , for example , when multiple lcp and rcp lines were seen , but each rcp line was at a higher velocity than any of the lcp lines .",
    "we felt it important to generate specific , objective , criteria that allowed an algorithmic approach to search for zeeman pairs and accept or reject them without resorting to a visual examination of spectra on a case - by - case basis , which can lead to significant unquantifiable biases .",
    "below we describe how we handled each of the complications .    for any given source , a `` window '' of radius @xmath11  cm",
    "was centered on the strongest line in either polarization in a single transition . in principle , if the window included one line in each polarization , the lines would be identified as a zeeman pair .",
    "however , emission channels key to identifying the second maser line in a zeeman pair sometimes lay just outside the window when it was centered on the position of brightest emission , whereas were the window moved between the position of the lines , it would pass the @xmath12  cm separation criterion . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the window center was moved from the centroid of strongest emission along a grid , in increments of 5% of the window radius , out to a maximum displacement of 50% of the radius in both the r.a . and",
    "dec directions .",
    "the window containing the largest number of lines was used , provided that at least one line of each polarization was included .",
    "`` tiebreaker '' criteria consisted first of choosing the window with the largest number of velocity channels represented and second of choosing the window whose offset from the grid center was smallest .",
    "next , all velocity channels contained in the chosen window were flagged as used , and the process was iterated with the remaining maser spots . in this way",
    ", the entire source was partitioned into windows consisting of potential zeeman pairs .",
    "this partitioning was done independently for each maser transition for which data were collected for the source .",
    "identification of zeeman pairs in windows containing only one maser line in each polarization is straightforward .",
    "figure 1a shows spectra from two windows for g351.775@xmath130.538 , one in each of the 1665 and 1667  mhz transitions .",
    "the 1665  mhz window contains two oppositely circularly - polarized maser lines . removing the effects of the zeeman splitting from a magnetic field of @xmath14  mg ( i.e. , oriented in the hemisphere toward the sun . )",
    ", the center velocity of the emission would be at @xmath15  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the 1667  mhz window , centered 120  mas away , shows a similar splitting of @xmath16  mg centered at a velocity of @xmath17  km  s@xmath1 . while a large fraction of the zeeman pairs we identified were found in windows containing exactly one maser line in each polarization , a few of these pairs appeared with a corroborating nearby pair of a similar magnetic field in another transition .",
    "table [ pairs_tab ] is a list of zeeman pairs with `` non - zero '' velocity separation .",
    "the flux , velocity , and velocity width of lines was determined by a gaussian fit to the center 5 channels of each line when available , else to 4 or only 3 channels .",
    "( by our criteria for a maser line , the center 3 channels must necessarily be detected . )",
    "pairs are only included in this table if the velocity difference between the lcp and rcp lines exceeds twice the signal - to - noise - limited velocity error , taken to be the sum in quadrature of the hwhm line width divided by the signal - to - noise ratio of each of the lines .",
    "however , in no case is a pair of lines allowed to satisfy this criterion if the velocity center separation is less than 5% of the quadrature sum of the line widths , or typically about 0.02  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these `` pairs '' may be actual zeeman pairs with a small splitting due to a small magnetic field , or they may be single maser spots with a large linear polarization fraction , but the limited spatial and velocity resolution of the vla and the absence of full - polarization observations render it difficult to decide between these two cases .",
    "these `` near zero '' velocity separation maser spots are listed in table 2 .    while identification of many of the pairs listed in table 1 was straightforward , not all windows were so simple to interpret . when a window contains more than one maser line in a polarization , interpreting the zeeman pattern is more complicated . in this case",
    ", it may still be possible to know the light - of - sight direction of the magnetic field , but not its strength .",
    "figure 1b shows the spectrum of one window associated with g032.744@xmath130.076 .",
    "there is one rcp maser line ( labelled 1 ) centered at 32.38  km  s@xmath1  and two lcp lines ( 2 and 3 ) at higher velocities ( 34.60 and 35.02  km  s@xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "additionally , there is one feature ( 4 ) that does not meet our criteria as a maser line , since the low - velocity side of the line is not seen , probably owing to blending with a stronger line elsewhere in the source .",
    "it is unclear which lcp line should be associated with the rcp line as a zeeman pair .",
    "regardless of the exact pairing , the rcp line is at lower velocity than any lcp line , so the line - of - sight orientation of the magnetic field is known to be pointed toward the sun .",
    "cases such as this , where the field direction is known but its strength is not , are frequent among our data .",
    "when a range of values is quoted for the magnetic field in table 1 , the direction of the magnetic field is well - determined , and the smallest and largest possible magnetic field intensities are given .",
    "some line parameters not listed in the table are given in the notes on individual sources .",
    "sometimes when a window contains enough maser lines such that the magnetic field strength or direction is ambiguous , supporting evidence may exist to suggest one pairing above all others . if a pairing in one transition implies a magnetic field strength and direction consistent with that of a pair in another transition at nearly the same location , that pairing is accepted in preference to all other possible pairings .",
    "figure 1c shows a 1665  mhz and a 1667  mhz window in k3@xmath1350 , coincident to within 46  mas . in each window",
    ", there is one rcp line ( 1 ) at lower velocity than either of the two lcp lines ( 2 and 3 ) , so the line - of - sight field is oriented toward the sun .",
    "but the field magnitude can also be deduced , assuming that the nearly overlapping windows in the two transitions are measuring the field at approximately the same location . in the 1665  mhz window ,",
    "pairing lines 1 and 2 would give a magnetic field of @xmath18  mg , while the 13 pairing implies a @xmath19  mg field .",
    "in the 1667  mhz window , the 12 pairing yields @xmath20  mg , while 13 yields @xmath21  mg .",
    "the close agreement between the field values for the 13 pairs for the two transitions suggests that these zeeman pairs should be favored over the other pairing possibilities .",
    "for definiteness , when appealing to corroborating evidence from one transition to resolve pairing ambiguities in another transition , we required @xmath22  mg , @xmath23  km  s@xmath1 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the difference of the implied magnetic field strengths , @xmath26 is the separation of the center velocity of each pair , @xmath27 is the positional offset between pairs , and @xmath28 is the zenith angle of the source as viewed from the location of the vla at transit .",
    "as noted in paper i , relative positional offsets between different oh transition frequencies are @xmath29 for high - declination sources , but grow to several arcseconds for sources at very low declination ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the function `` @xmath31 '' was chosen in the spirit of the plane - parallel approximation for the atmospheric contribution to the relative error between observations of different transitions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if two pairings in the same window in the same transition imply the same magnetic field direction and strength , those pairings are also accepted over all other pairings .",
    "this situation arises when two zeeman pairs in the same transition are encompassed in the same window .",
    "figure 1d shows a 1665  mhz window for g45.465@xmath320.047 that contains a cluster of maser lines .",
    "since all of the rcp lines are at a higher velocity than the lcp lines , the magnetic field is oriented away from the sun .",
    "however , the velocities associated with the line centers favor two particular pairings : pairing lines 1 and 4 yields a magnetic field strength of 3.7  mg , and 2 and 5 yield 3.8  mg .",
    "occasionally , a window would produce a spectrum with a clear , strong line in one polarization and an incomplete line in the opposite polarization",
    ". a closer look at the data would show that one or two critical points of the incomplete line lay just outside the window . by increasing the size of the window ,",
    "a zeeman pair was often identified . using a larger window ( generally twice the clustering radius )",
    "can be justified for two reasons .",
    "first , the window radius of @xmath11  cm is based on the clustering scale analysis of @xcite , which is itself based on only one source : w3(oh ) , assuming the photometric distance of 2.2  kpc @xcite .",
    "the kinematic distance of 4.3  kpc , assuming the nh@xmath33 lsr velocity of @xmath34  km  s@xmath1  @xcite and a flat @xmath35  kpc , @xmath36  km  s@xmath1  rotation curve , would correspond to a clustering scale of @xmath37  cm , or twice that which is derived from the photometric distance . in any case , it is unclear to what extent this varies among massive sfrs .",
    "second , the distance to some of the massive sfrs is unknown .",
    "if the assumed distance to the source is greater than the actual distance , the ( angular ) window radius used would be proportionally smaller than the desired @xmath38  cm . for sources for which the kinematic distance ambiguity has not been resolved ,",
    "the zeeman pair identification analysis was done twice , assuming each of the near and far distances for calculation of the clustering scale .",
    "zeeman pairs identified assuming either distance were accepted and are listed in table [ pairs_tab ] . despite the distance uncertainty , we believe that zeeman pairs identified around these sources are still reliable indicators of the local magnetic field . when the far kinematic distance is more than a few times the near kinematic distance , possible errors involve partitioning a far source into windows that are too large or a near source into windows that are too small . in the former case ,",
    "nearly all of the maser emission of a source ( presumedly ) located at the far kinematic distance would be concentrated in a single window when the near distance was used for the angular clustering scale , resulting in confusion of zeeman pairs . in the latter case",
    ", a ( presumed ) near source would be micropartitioned into windows of small radius , rejecting many zeeman pairs coincident to within the desired linear clustering scale .",
    "thus , misresolving the near / far kinematic distance ambiguity results in the identification of fewer zeeman pairs , regardless of whether a far source is assumed to be near or a near source is assumed to be far .",
    "zeeman pairs were also graded to reflect the uncertainty in pairing .",
    "pairs from windows containing only one line in each polarization were assigned a grade of b , unless they were confirmed by a similar pair in a second transition , in which case they were given a grade of a. all pairs whose pairing was ambiguous were given a grade of c , even if the ambiguity was resolved by appealing to a second pair in the same or another transition .",
    "pairs for which the separation of the zeeman components exceeded the default window size were assessed a grade of d. in one case in g081.871 + 0.781 , a grade of d was assigned to a zeeman pair believed to be spurious ; for further details see  [ sourcenotes ] .",
    "this grading system is in the spirit of , although not identical to , the system used in @xcite , in which the main emphasis was on whether interferometry was used to identify zeeman splitting , and if so , at what resolution .",
    "all of the zeeman pairs listed in table [ pairs_tab ] were identified using interferometry .",

    "there is a distance ambiguity . for a number of these sources ,",

    "that paper also provides an analysis of the scale height of known uc regions ( embedded in massive sfrs ) above the galactic plane , including an analysis of the accuracy of resolving the distance ambiguity to a uc region given only the kinematic distances and galactic _ latitude _ of the region .",

    "when evaluating kinematic distances , we assumed that massive sfrs have a peculiar motion of @xmath45  km  s@xmath1 .",

    "whose median lsr velocity of oh maser emission is close to 0 km  s@xmath1 , the near kinematic distance is often unrealistically close .",
    "since the angular window radius as described in  [ criteria ] is inversely proportional to the assumed distance to the source , a source assumed to be much nearer than it is would be partitioned into windows encompassing too large of an angular area .",
    "the resulting windows would be few in number and contain a large number of maser lines .",
    "the effect is amplified for especially near distances ( a few hundred parsecs or less ) , where a small velocity error translates into a large fractional distance error and therefore a large fractional error in the window size . to be consistent ( if somewhat arbitrary ) in handling these extremely near sources ( @xmath47  kpc ) , we used the distance produced by averaging the kinematic distance derived from the median oh maser velocity and 2.0 kpc .",

    "in addition to problems associated with a possible magnetic field reversal across the source , the vla beam is large enough to encompass several maser clumps .",

    "however , rand & kulkarni also presented evidence for magnetic field reversals between rings , which was not critically tested in the reid & silverstein study .",
    "should the magnetic field as deduced from the zeeman splitting of oh masers around massive sfrs show any galactic - scale structure ?",

    "* ) and extragalactic rotation measure observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , the oh clumps must `` remember '' the galactic magnetic field after a magnetic compression of about three orders of magnitude from interstellar values . and third , intra - source reversals of the magnetic field in an individual massive sfr must be sufficiently few so as to not destroy a possible observed large - scale galactic magnetic field by the inclusion of inferred local magnetic field directions that are opposite to the actual prevailing magnetic field direction near the source .    of these three conditions ,",
    "the most difficult to justify on a physical basis is the assumption that the magnetic field direction at a site of massive star - formation would retain its initial ( galactic ) direction through collapse .",
    "ammonia observations of w3(oh ) suggest that the density in oh maser clumps is @xmath83  @xmath80 @xcite , which is a factor of @xmath84 higher than found in giant molecular clouds and a factor of @xmath85 greater than typical values in the ism .",
    "it is unclear why the magnetic field in these clumps would retain the orientation of the field in the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) during the compression phase , which may also entail many rotations of the clumps around the central condensation , and why the gmc would retain the orientation of the interstellar field .      assuming that the second and third of the above conditions are satisfied",

    "the simplest imaginable galactic field would be a circular field with no reversals in the portion of the disk where massive sfrs are found .",
    "our 74-source sample discussed in  [ otherzeeman ] do not support this model .",
    "a plot of the predominant sense of the magnetic field direction ( i.e. , clockwise or counterclockwise as viewed from the north galactic pole ) deduced from the oh masers near massive sfrs in this study is shown in figure [ galaxy ] . for a circular magnetic field configuration in the milky way",

    "indeed , it would not be inconsistent with a completely random distribution of magnetic field orientations .",
    "the rough equality of sources with clockwise and counterclockwise fields does not preclude an organized field structure .",
    "for instance , the magnetic field could be aligned along either concentric rings or spiral arms but with reversals between the rings or arms .",
    "alternatively , the magnetic field as traced by interstellar oh masers could exhibit organized structure in small ( kiloparsec - scale ) patches , but not on a galactic scale .",
    "since our data do not imply a uniform sense of the galactic magnetic field , a two - point spatial correlation function was calculated on the data in order to test the hypothesis that magnetic field directions of massive sfrs exhibit some degree of correlation over kiloparsec scales .",
    "we define the magnetic field orientation of two massive sfrs to be correlated if they are both oriented in a clockwise or counterclockwise galactic sense .",
    "we similarly define a pair to be anti - correlated if the pair consists of one source with a clockwise field and one with a counterclockwise field .",
    "the correlation function was defined as the number of pairs of massive sfrs whose fields were correlated in the above sense , divided by the total number of pairs of sources .",
    "this function was calculated for a range of intersource distances .",
    "since interpretation of the significance of the correlation function is difficult in isolation , it was compared against the same function evaluated for randomly - generated magnetic - field direction data at the locations of the massive sfrs in our sample . in the random sample ,",
    "the positions of the maser sources were held fixed , but the line - of - sight field orientation of each source was randomly assigned as toward or away from the sun .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath87 such random field distributions was produced .",
    "the results are shown in table [ corr_tab ] .",
    "the percentages of trial runs showing a lesser and greater degree of correlation do not sum to 100% because some random distributions of magnetic fields produced identical correlation results .",
    "since the data exhibit roughly equal likelihood of less and more correlation at the 10 or 20  kpc level , our data do not support the original hypothesis of @xcite that there exists a uniform , clockwise galactic field . on galactic scales ,",
    "pulsar rotation measure studies suggest that field reversals exist between spiral arms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would destroy any large - scale correlation on the galactic scale , as spiral arms with oppositely - oriented magnetic fields would be included at this scale .    on sub - kiloparsec scales",
    "there are a number of source complexes in which two nearby massive sfrs have oppositely - oriented line - of - sight magnetic fields .",
    "the w49 complex provides a good example of this : g43.148 + 0.015 ( the zeeman pair is between the sources w49a / r@xmath46 and r@xmath33 in the classification of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and w49s have fields directed primarily away from the sun , while the field of w49n is directed toward the sun .",
    "it is possible that this may result from a tangled field geometry associated with multiple cores in the same complex .",
    "nevertheless , we do note a possible field organization on a @xmath88-kpc scale .",
    "indeed , several patches of field coherence at this scale are noticeable in figure [ galaxy ] .",
    "for instance , there is a cluster of sources with clockwise magnetic fields ( i.e. , oriented toward the sun ) near @xmath89  kpc , and another cluster with clockwise fields near @xmath90  kpc .",
    "the structure of the galactic magnetic field can be studied with rotation measures of galactic pulsars and extragalactic sources .",
    "we find that toward the second and third galactic quadrants , which contain only six sources , all fields are oriented in the clockwise direction , while the nearest six sources in the first and fourth quadrants are consistent with a counterclockwise field .",
    "this agrees with rotation measure studies of the outer galaxy , which also find an overall clockwise field @xcite .",
    "this also agrees with a reversal inward claimed in other papers from pulsar rotation measure estimates @xcite .    in order to compare our results with the galactic magnetic field deduced from rotation measures",
    ", we generated simulated rotation measure data from the line - of - sight magnetic field direction of our oh maser data .",
    "our data consist of measurements of milligauss fields _ in situ _ around massive sfrs , while extragalactic rotation measures are line - of - sight integrals predominantly through the microgauss fields of the interstellar medium .",
    "we calculated simulated rotation measures along rays of galactic longitude within the galactic plane using the line - of - sight field directions from oh masers .",
    "the rotation measure @xmath91 of radiation coming from a source at a distance @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the electron density in @xmath80 , @xmath95 is the magnetic field in gauss , and @xmath96 is measured in parsecs .",
    "typical values for these variables in the interstellar medium are @xmath97  @xmath80 @xcite and @xmath98  g @xcite .",
    "given that magnetic fields implied by zeeman splitting in massive sfrs exhibit some correlation on a scale of @xmath99  kpc ( see  [ sgmf ] ) , we postulated that the magnetic field around a massive sfr indicates the prevailing galactic magnetic field direction in a sphere of radius @xmath100 centered at the massive sfr .",
    "we adopted @xmath101  kpc , which yields a contribution of about 50  rad  m@xmath102 to the rotation measure of a line of sight passing along the diameter of each sphere .",
    "thus , we assigned a rotation measure of @xmath103  rad  m@xmath102 to each sphere , depending only on the line - of - sight magnetic field direction in the massive sfr , and summed the rotation measures of the spheres intersected by the ray .",
    "for simplicity , each sphere was assumed to contribute @xmath103  rad  m@xmath102 to the total rotation measure , regardless of the path length of the ray within the sphere .",
    "note that since the radiation propagates from @xmath92 to @xmath104 , @xmath96 is oriented toward the sun , and @xmath105 is negative when the magnetic field is oriented away from the sun .",
    "thus , a positive magnetic field generates a negative rotation measure .",
    "our simulated rotation measures are plotted in figure [ rml ] for @xmath106  kpc .",
    "features of the plot are not highly sensitive to the value of @xmath100 , but much lower values leave a large volume of the galactic plane unsampled by our data , while much higher values result in a lot of overlap of the spheres .",
    "superposed atop this plot are extragalactic rotation measures reproduced directly from figure 9 of @xcite , based on data from @xcite .",
    "our data agree reasonably well with the extragalactic rotation measure data . in the second and third galactic quadrants ,",
    "our data match the sign of the extragalactic rotation measures .",
    "while the extragalactic rotation measures are not generally of consistent sign in the first and fourth quadrants , agreement is found again at @xmath107 , where the extragalactic rotation measures are decidedly positive .",
    "the simulated rotation measures we deduce from oh zeeman splitting appear to fit the extragalactic data at least as well as , if not better than , the ring model of @xcite .",
    "in many models , one would expect the galactic field to be organized along spiral arms .",
    "however , investigating whether the galactic field shows organization on a per - arm basis necessitates assignment of massive sfrs to spiral arms . based on positions on both a plot of the galaxy and on the longitude - velocity diagram in figure [ lvplot ] ,",
    "most of the sources in our study were assigned to a spiral arm , as listed in table [ arm_tab ] .",
    "the above correlation analysis was repeated on the subset of sources associated with each spiral arm , and the results are included in table [ corr_tab ] .",
    "for the most part , no obvious correlations exist except for sources assigned to the norma arm , where 8 of 10 sources ( and all 7 in the fourth quadrant ) have a magnetic field oriented clockwise with respect to the galactic center .",
    "as noted above , it is difficult to make strong statements pertaining to field directions in spiral arms .",
    "the shape and locations of the spiral arms in the milky way are still a matter of debate , and many of the source distances used in this study are kinematic and therefore subject to large enough errors that some could be placed in the wrong arms .",
    "even assuming that the near / far kinematic distance ambiguity has been resolved correctly for all sources , a typical distance error by this method is about 1  kpc .",
    "furthermore , the oh maser velocity may differ from the velocity of the massive sfr , which may in turn deviate quite significantly from uniform circular motion , as discussed in  [ distances ] . especially near @xmath108 , where several spiral arms cross in a longitude - velocity diagram , it is difficult to reliably assign massive sfrs to spiral arms .      the problem of relating oh zeeman magnetic field measurements to the galactic magnetic field can be inverted .",
    "assuming that there exists a large - scale galactic field , do our results allow us to comment either on whether the magnetic field threading oh maser clumps are related to the ( pre - collapse ) local galactic field or on whether intra - source field reversals confuse the issue too much to see conclusive evidence of large - scale field organization ?",
    "these are questions that can not be answered conclusively with the vla alone , due to its large beam size .",
    "for instance , no conclusive zeeman pairs are found in the 1665 mhz transition in the vla data for w3(oh ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite identified 23 zeeman pairs in the same transition using vlbi .",
    "significant blending of independent maser features within a single vla beam often renders identification of zeeman pairs ambiguous , as discussed in  [ otherzeeman ] .",
    "when zeeman pairs are identified with vla resolution , they are often in short supply . we were able to find only one zeeman pair in many of the massive sfrs shown in table [ pairs_tab ] .",
    "one pair does not conclusively determine the prevailing magnetic field direction surrounding the region .",
    "even in the simple case , depicted in figure [ sphere ] , of a conducting , spherical region in a uniform magnetic field , the line - of - sight projection of the magnetic field direction may vary depending on the inclination of the source @xcite .",
    "a numerical simulation was run to estimate the fraction of sources whose line - of - sight magnetic field would be incorrectly inferred owing to projection effects for this simple geometry . given an ensemble of ideal , spherical regions , each with a randomly - oriented prevailing magnetic field direction and a single magnetic field measurement taken locally at a random point on the projection of the sphere ( as from a zeeman pair )",
    ", the line - of - sight direction of the measured field will be opposite to the line - of - sight direction of the prevailing magnetic field 25% of the time .",
    "intra - source field reversals have been seen across three of nine massive sfrs that were mapped in the main - line oh transitions with the vlba : g351.775@xmath130.538 @xcite , w75n , and w75s ( unpublished data ) .",
    "thus , one - third of the population of massive sfrs mapped at milliarcsecond resolution show at least two distinct maser clumps with zeeman pairs indicating opposite line - of - sight directions . while one might have expected that the magnetic field would be oriented randomly in a massive sfr owing to a complex evolutionary history that `` scrambles '' the pre - collapse field , massive sfrs with intra - source field reversals still exhibit an organized field structure .",
    "more likely , these reversals are a projection effect due to the geometry of the field lines relative to the observer . still , the ionized sphere model is surely an oversimplification in some cases .",
    "for instance , the oh masers around w75n are aligned along two intersecting lines , one running roughly north - south and the other east - west @xcite .",
    "our vlba data show that the magnetic fields along the north - south line point consistently away from the sun , while those in the east - west line point consistently toward the sun .",
    "baart et al",
    ".  suggest that the masers trace expanding shock waves , while @xcite claim to have found evidence that the north - south structure is a thin , rotating disk .",
    "whatever the explanation of this source may be , the observed intra - source field reversal is clearly not a simple projection effect in a static environment .",
    "even if the galactic magnetic field consists of a large - scale field with regular structure , the turbulent field component may hinder clear detection of the pattern .",
    "synchrotron polarization observations suggest that the ratio of field strengths of the regular to turbulent magnetic fields may be between 0.6 and 1.0 , with lower values more likely in spiral arms @xcite . assuming a uniformly random two - dimensional ( in the galactic plane ) orientation of the turbulent component of the magnetic field , the line - of - sight orientation of the total field will be opposite to that of the regular component 8% to 20% of the time for the aforementioned range of field strength ratios .",
    "thus , even if the pre - collapse magnetic field orientation is preserved at sites of oh maser emission , as many as one in five sources could imply a line - of - sight magnetic field opposite to the assumed underlying regular field . on the other hand , @xcite present evidence that the random field may be partially aligned with the uniform field , rather than being isotropic .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the above estimates of the rate of discrepancy between the magnetic field direction implied by oh zeeman splitting and the regular field direction may be overly pessimistic .",
    "also , the random component of the galactic magnetic field may become less significant between interstellar and gmc densities .",
    "we have found nearly 100 zeeman pairs of ground - state oh masers using the data from paper i. combining these zeeman pairs with others found in the literature , we have investigated the distribution in the galactic plane of the line - of - sight orientation of magnetic fields in massive sfrs as deduced from oh maser zeeman splitting .",
    "our data do not support the original hypothesis of @xcite that the large - scale magnetic field traced by oh masers is uniform in the clockwise sense , nor do we find that the inferred magnetic fields show a uniform direction in each spiral arm .",
    "all six sources in the second and third galactic quadrants , which are typically 1 or 2  kpc distant , have a magnetic field oriented in the clockwise sense as viewed from the north galactic pole , while nearly all nearby sources in the first and fourth quadrants have a magnetic field oriented in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "this supports the hypothesis , deduced from pulsar rotation measures , that a reversal of the galactic - scale magnetic field occurs near the galactocentric radius of the sun .",
    "our method for identifying zeeman pairs in vla maps of oh masers is limited by the blending of maser components inevitable with a large ( @xmath109 ) beamsize",
    ". the higher resolution of vlbi allows many more maser spots to be detected and zeeman pairs to be identified unambiguously .",
    "the increased detail in vlbi images also allows for the identification of intra - source magnetic field reversals , the interpretation of which may be important both for understanding the conditions of the magnetic field in massive sfrs and for obtaining enough data to rigorously test the hypothesis that the magnetic field deduced from oh maser zeeman splitting in massive sfrs is correlated with the galactic magnetic field .",
    "to this end , we are in the process of imaging interstellar oh masers with the vlba .",
    "the results will be published in a future paper .",
