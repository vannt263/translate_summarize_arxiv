    "extensive efforts have been made in recent years , to understand the decay of * light * di - nuclear systems ( a@xmath5 @xmath6 60 ) formed through low - energy ( e@xmath7 @xmath6 10 mev / nucleon ) heavy - ion reactions [ 1 ] . in most of the reactions",
    "studied , the observed fully energy - damped yields of the fragments have been successfully explained in terms of a fusion - fission mechanism [ 1 ] with the noticeable exception of @xmath2si+@xmath3c reaction for which the deep - inelastic orbiting mechanism has been found to be particularly competitive [ 2 ] .",
    "strong resonance - like structures have been observed in elastic and inelastic excitation functions of some specific reactions ( such as @xmath8mg+@xmath8 mg or @xmath2si+@xmath2si ) indicating the presence of shell stabilized , highly deformed configurations in the ( @xmath9cr and @xmath1ni ) compound systems  @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the structure of the doubly - magic @xmath1ni nucleus has recently become a subject of great interest  @xcite . in a recent experiment using the eurogam multidetector array ,",
    "the present collaboration studied the possibility of preferential population of highly deformed bands in the symmetric fission channel of the @xmath1ni compound nucleus ( cn ) , produced through the @xmath2si+@xmath2si  @xcite reaction at e@xmath10 mev , which corresponds to the energy of the conjectured j@xmath11 = 38@xmath12 quasi - molecular resonance  @xcite .",
    "the study of light charged particle ( lcp ) emission is a good tool in exploring nuclear deformations and other properties of hot rotating nuclei at high spins and angular momenta  @xcite .",
    "the present work has been performed with the aim to investigate the possible occurence of highly deformed configurations of the @xmath0ca and @xmath1ni di - nuclear systems as formed in the @xmath2si+@xmath3c and @xmath2si+@xmath2si reactions , by using the properties of emitted lcp .",
    "inclusive as well as exclusive data of the heavy fragments ( a @xmath13 6 ) and their associated light charged particles ( p , d , t , and @xmath14-particles ) emitted in both reactions at @xmath15(@xmath2si ) = 112 , 180 mev have been measured  @xcite using the * icare * multidetector array  @xcite .",
    "the lcp s emitted from ff fragments may provide the deformation properties of these fragments .",
    "moreover , the in - plane angular correlations data will be used to extract the emitters temperatures . in this paper",
    "we will present the exclusive data of lcp s in coincidence with er .",
    "the two experiments were performed at the ires strasbourg vivitron tandem facility using 112 mev and 180 mev @xmath2si beams on @xmath3c ( 160 @xmath16g/@xmath17 thick ) and @xmath2si ( 230 @xmath16g/@xmath17 thick ) targets respectively  @xcite .",
    "both the heavy ions ( a @xmath13 6 ) and their associated lcp s ( p , d , t , and @xmath14 ) were detected using the * icare * charged particle multidetector array  @xcite which consists in nearly 40 telescopes in coincidence .",
    "the heavy fragments , i.e. er , quasi - elastic ( qe ) , di , and ff fragments , were detected in 10 telescopes , each consisting of an ionisation chamber ( ic ) followed by a 500 @xmath16 m si detector .",
    "the in - plane coincident lcp s were detected using either 3 three - elements telescopes ( si 40 @xmath16 m , si 300 @xmath16 m , 2 cm csi(tl ) ) or 24 two - elements telescopes ( si 40 @xmath16 m , 2 cm csi(tl ) ) and two double telescopes ( ic , si 500 @xmath16 m ) located at the most backward angles .",
    "the ic s were filled with isobutane and the pressures were kept at 30 torrs and at 60 torrs for detecting heavy fragments and light fragments , respectively .",
    "the acceptance of each telescope was defined by thick aluminium collimators .",
    "the lcp spectra obtained in both of the reactions have maxwellian shapes with an exponential fall - off at high energy ( their shape and high - energy slopes are essentially independent of c.m .",
    "angle ) which reflects a relatively low temperature of the decaying nucleus .",
    "this is the signature of a statistical de - excitation process arising from a thermalized compound nucleus like source .",
    "the energy spectra of the coincident @xmath14-particles , for the reactions @xmath2si+@xmath2si and @xmath2si+@xmath3c at e@xmath7=180mev , have been displayed in figs .  1 and 2 respectively  @xcite .",
    "+        the analysis of the data has been performed using cacarizo  @xcite , the monte carlo version of the statistical - model code cascade  @xcite .",
    "the informations on the main ingredients of the statistical description , _",
    "i.e. , _ the nuclear level densities and the barrier transmission probabilities , are usually obtained from the study of the evaporated light particle spectra . in recent years , it has been observed that the standard statistical model could not predict satisfactorily , the shape of the evaporated @xmath14-particle energy spectra  @xcite and the measured average energies of the @xmath14-particles were much lower than the corresponding theoretical predictions .",
    "several attempts have been made in the past few years to explain this anomaly either by changing the emission barrier or using a spin - dependent level density  @xcite .",
    "in hot rotating nuclei formed in heavy - ion reactions , the energy level density at higher angular momentum is spin dependent .",
    "the level density , @xmath18 , for a given angular momentum @xmath19 and energy @xmath20 is given by the well known fermi gas expression :      where @xmath22 the level density parameter is taken equal to a/8 , t is the  nuclear \" temperature , and @xmath23 is the pairing correction , e@xmath24 = @xmath25j(j+1 ) is the rotational energy , @xmath26 is the effective moment of inertia , @xmath27 is the rigid body moment of inertia , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are deformation parameters  @xcite .    by changing the deformability parameters @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 one can simulate the spin - dependent level density  @xcite .",
    "the cacarizo calculations have been performed using two sets of input parameters : one with a standard set consistent with the deformation of the finite range liquid drop model ( frldm )  @xcite , and another with a spin - dependent moment of inertia and non - zero values for the deformability parameters .",
    "as observed at e@xmath7= 112 mev data  @xcite , the energy spectra of the @xmath14 spectra is well reproduced after including the deformation .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .  1 show the predictions of cacarizo using the standard frldm deformation parameter set .",
    "it is clear that the average energies of the measured @xmath14 energy spectra are lower than those predicted by the standard statistical - model calculations .",
    "the solid lines show the predictions of cacarizo using the paramater set with non- zero values @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the exclusive energy spectra of @xmath14-particle measured in coincidence with individual s and p er s , which are shown in fig .",
    "2 for the reaction @xmath2si+@xmath3c at e@xmath7 = 180 mev , are quite interesting .",
    "the spectra associated with s are completely different from those associated with p. the latter are reasonably well reproduced by the cacarizo curves whereas the model could not predict the shape of the spectra obtained in coincidence with s. an additional non - statistical components appear to be significant in this case .",
    "the similar results have been observed at the lower bombarding energy e@xmath7 = 112 mev  @xcite .",
    "these non - statistical components may come from the decay of unbound @xmath4be ( in g.s . and the two first excited states ) produced in the binary reaction @xmath0ca",
