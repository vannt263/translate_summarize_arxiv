    "although bimodal planar ising spin glass models are very simple in concept , they are extremely controversial . one main reason why concerns the energy gap between the ground and first excited states .",
    "to date , most work has been reported for the square lattice where there is wide acceptance for the scenario of a critical point only at zero temperature @xcite . in the absence of any contradictory evidence or suggestion , we assume this to be the case for other planar models , including the brickwork lattice .",
    "bimodal models have bond ( nearest - neighbor ) interactions of fixed magnitude @xmath2 and random sign .",
    "both the ground and excited states have a very large degeneracy . for an infinite square lattice , without open boundaries , it is clear that any finite number of spin flips must either result in another ground state or an excited state with an increase in energy not less than @xmath3 .",
    "for the brickwork lattice the corresponding energy gap is clearly @xmath0 , since the lattice coordination number is three .",
    "about 20 years ago , wang and swendsen @xcite published evidence that the energy gap for the square lattice in the thermodynamic limit was @xmath0 .",
    "this flew in the face of the naive expectation of @xmath3 .",
    "essentially , the claim was that it is possible for an infinite number of spin flips to provide an excited state with energy only @xmath0 above a ground state .",
    "the issue here is the noncommutativity of the zero - temperature and thermodynamic limits .",
    "the thermodynamic limit has to be taken first .",
    "nevertheless , for the brickwork lattice we do not expect this to be an issue and the main interest of this paper is to show evidence that this is the case . both models have the same energy gap in the thermodynamic limit , although the reasons why are quite different .    for the square lattice",
    "there are three scenarios in the literature regarding the energy gap .",
    "first , support for the @xmath0 energy gap includes work at finite temperatures involving exact computations of partition functions @xcite , a worm algorithm @xcite and monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "distributions of excited - state degeneracies at arbitrary temperature @xcite also indicate a @xmath0 gap .",
    "essentially , it was shown that the degeneracy of the first excited state per ground state and per spin diverges in the thermodynamic limit . in consequence the @xmath3 gap of the finite system",
    "is reduced to @xmath0 .",
    "second , saul and kardar @xcite reported that the energy gap should be @xmath3 as suggested by simple analysis .",
    "the third published scenario @xcite basically claims that the energy gap approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit leading to power law behaviour for the specific heat .",
    "this possibility has been discussed at some length in ref . , although clear conclusions remain unavailable due to difficulties related to finite lattice size and extrapolation to very low temperature .    the brickwork lattice ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig1](a ) ) studied in this paper is logically equivalent to the hexagonal , or honeycomb , lattice ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig1](b ) ) . very little",
    "work has been published to date , especially concerning the ground state .",
    "the ground state energy per bond has been quoted @xcite as @xmath4 .",
    "the entropy per spin has been reported by aromsawa @xcite as @xmath5 with an energy @xmath6 per spin , in good agreement with ref . .",
    "the spin glass phase is thought to exist for a concentration of negative bonds @xcite above about @xmath7 .",
    "work at finite temperature @xcite places the multicritical , or nishimori , point at the same concentration ; in agreement if reentrant phase boundaries are absent .",
    "( a ) the brickwork lattice .",
    "( b ) the equivalent hexagonal lattice.,width=321 ]    our calculations of the degeneracies of excited states for the brickwork lattice are exact .",
    "the temperature is fixed and arbitrarily low ; we do not use any numerical value .",
    "the lattice is constructed by taking a square lattice and diluting bonds in a regular manner to leave plaquettes with six perimeter bonds ; logically equivalent to hexagons as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] .",
    "the disorder realizations are independently quenched random configurations of negative bonds in a patch that contains all the frustrated plaquettes .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in one dimension .",
    "the number of sites @xmath8 for this dimension is necessarily even .",
    "the cylindrically wound frustrated patch is embedded in an infinite unfrustrated environment in the second dimension .",
    "an algorithm based on the pfaffian method @xcite and degenerate state perturbation theory @xcite for the square lattice was adapted to evaluate the degeneracies of excited states for the brickwork lattice .",
    "the main points of this procedure are given in the following .",
    "from the square lattice , we dilute bonds in a regular manner to define the brickwork lattice . using the fermion decoration of bonds ( one either side ) , a brickwork plaquette has eight fermions inside ( filled circles ) and six others across the bonds as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath10 is a singular matrix at zero temperature with zero eigenvalues which are equal in number to the number of frustrated plaquettes .",
    "each eigenvalue approaches zero according to the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an integer ( an order of perturbation theory ) and @xmath15 is a real number .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be exactly evaluated by degenerate state pertubation theory .",
    "the ground - state energy and entropy of the system can be defined similarly as for the square lattice @xcite .",
    "it is equivalent to expressing the ground - state degeneracy as @xmath16 where the product is over all the positive defect eigenvalues .",
    "the gauge - invariant method is applied similarly as for the square lattice @xcite to separate the singularities of @xmath10 for the brickwork lattice using real matrices as follows . at zero temperature ,",
    "the perfect system ( no frustration ) green s function @xcite @xmath17 is obtained by transforming @xmath10 into a plane - wave basis and inverting an @xmath18 matrix .",
    "the nonzero elements of @xmath17 are only across bonds and localized inside plaquettes .",
    "across bonds we have @xmath19 where the matrix indices are defined in fig . 4 of ref . .",

    "we write exactly @xmath25 where @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , is used as a parameter for a perturbation expansion .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 is singular and has defect eigenvectors @xmath29 corresponding to defect ( zero ) eigenvalue , that is @xmath30 , localized on each frustrated plaquette , similar to those found for the square lattice @xcite .    at first order the matrix @xmath31 , which is @xmath32 block diagonal across bonds ,",
    "is diagonalized in the basis of the defect eigenvectors .",
    "we also require the continuum green s function @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 defined similarly to ref .",
    ". we can write @xmath37 where @xmath38 has matrix elements connecting the basis states within a brickwork plaquette while @xmath39 connects only basis states across a single bond , that is @xmath40 and is only relevant for excited states .",
    "although @xmath17 can take us to the fermions associated with diluted bonds ( labeled @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] ) , it can be proven that these matrix elements do not effect the calculation of the partition function since @xmath42 across that bond is equal to zero ( there is no energy ) ; we can disregard them .",
    "an alternative pffaffian based on three nodes per site has been given in ref .",
    "but it can not be adapted to our defect problem .",

    "( [ e : ev ] ) is essentially determined by the normalization of this vector .    at second order ,",
    "we diagonalize @xmath53 . to continue for higher orders",
    ", we require the green s functions @xmath54 , as given in ref .",
    ", obtained from previous orders ; that is for states whose degeneracy has already been lifted .",
    "the general rule for @xmath55 ( at @xmath14th order ) can be expressed as @xmath56 .",
    "the calculation of the internal energy and the specific heat for the brickwork lattice is similar to the square lattice as described in ref . .",
    "the internal energy is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the ground state energy and @xmath59 , for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 @xmath62 is the highest order of pertubation theory required .",
    "however , there is one essential distinction between the square and brickwork lattices .",
    "since we need three colors to color the brickwork lattice , this means that the color rules described in ref .",
    "are invalid and it follows that @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",
    "the specific heat per spin can be expressed in terms of the internal energy as @xmath65 the degeneracy of the @xmath66th excited state is given as @xmath67 .",
    "expanding @xmath68 , we get , for example , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "[ f : fig5 ] shows the distributions of @xmath71 for the spin glass with @xmath72 spins .",
    "it is clear that the most likely value scales as the number of spins .",
    "we also consider a different shape of the patch boundary by changing the lattice size to @xmath73 so that the equivalent hexagonal lattice has a more balanced shape .",
    "the distribution of @xmath71 with @xmath73 spins also shows again a most likely value that scales as the number of spins as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig6 ] . also , the value is roughly the same . in both cases ,",
    "it is clear that the leading term of the specific heat grows like @xmath74 indicating a @xmath0 excitation gap .",
    "moreover , the distributions of @xmath71 are extreme , do not self - average and are neither normal or lognormal .",
    "this is consistent with the square lattice as in ref . .",
    "the distributions of @xmath71 clearly show extreme - value distributed properties with a fat tail .",
    "it is thus reasonable to analyze the distributions according to the frchet distribution with the probability density function : @xmath75 where the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 indicate location , shape and scale of the distribution respectively .",
    "the mode can be calculated by @xmath79 .",
    "we estimate the parameters by a maximum likelihood estimator @xcite to fit actual disorder realizations . it is found that the frchet distribution can not fit exactly the peak of our actual distribution ; the quality of the fit is quite poor and",
    "also deteriorates with respect to increasing @xmath8 .",
    "an example for @xmath80 with @xmath73 spins is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig7](a ) .",
    "we have also tried to polish the fit using the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite to fit the bin data , setting initial values of parameters equal to the values obtained from the algorithm of hosking @xcite .",
    "this provides alternative parameters and the curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig7](b ) .",
    "although the quality of the fit looks a little better and the position of the mode somewhat improves , we are not convinced that eq .",
    "( [ e : fre ] ) should necessarily describe the distribution exactly .    for comparison , at different values of @xmath8 ,",
    "the fitted distributions divided by @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig8 ] .",
    "it is also useful to present the mode of the fitted distributions as a function of @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ f : fig9 ] .",
    "we trust that the mode converges ; there is no reason to believe otherwise .",
    "we have also found distributions for the second contribution to the internal energy , @xmath82 .",
    "these are shown in figs .",
    "[ f : fig10 ] and [ f : fig11 ] .",
    "the most likely value is very close to zero .",
    "the skewness also suggests the dominance of the first excitations .",
    "we thus believe that higher excitations are unlikely to change our conclusion that the energy gap is @xmath0 .",
    "the mode of @xmath83 alone scales as @xmath84 and @xmath85 as shown in figs .",
    "[ f : fig12 ] and [ f : fig13 ] , respectively .",
    "in conclusion , we have reported exact results for the excitations of the bimodal ising spin glass on the brickwork lattice by expanding in arbitrary temperature from the ground state .",
    "this is complimentary to the more usual extrapolation from finite temperature .",
    "we find that the energy gap is @xmath0 for both finite and infinite lattices .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is trivial in contrast to the difficulties associated with the square lattice .",
    "our result may suggest that a @xmath0 energy gap is universal for planar bimodal ising spin glasses in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for instance , the triangular lattice could very well be expected to behave similarly to the square lattice since its plaquettes can be colored using just two colors ; the brickwork lattice requires three colors .    as a final note",
    ", we expect a correlation length @xmath86 in probable agreement @xcite with the square lattice .",
    "our reasoning is based on the construction of correlation functions using reciprocal defects @xcite and closed polygons .",
    "the essential point is that , for a finite lattice , the correlation functions must be analytical functions of @xmath87 and thus of @xmath88 .",
    "comparison with the asymptotic expression @xmath89 for correlation functions at large separation @xmath90 , allows us to deduce that @xmath91 is also an analytical function of @xmath92 .",
    "if the thermodynamic limit is trivial for the energy gap , then it is very likely to be so for the correlation length .",
    "it is also known that the fully frustrated brickwork lattice has a constant correlation length @xcite and that the ground state is not critical , unlike the villain model @xcite that has a nonanalytical free energy although @xmath93 nevertheless @xcite .",
