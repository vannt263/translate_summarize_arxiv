    "in ( * ? ? ? * theorem  1 ) rade  ivaljevi  proved that it is possible to cut a half of every one of @xmath1 nice measures in @xmath2 by a union of several cones of a simple fan translated by some vector .",
    "a simple fan is built of cones on facets of a simplex and a union of several cones is called a `` curtain '' in  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we call a measure @xmath3 in @xmath4 _ nice _ if it is normalized with @xmath5 , has compact support , and every affine hyperplane @xmath6 has @xmath7 .    in particular , in the two - dimensional case",
    "the curtain partition theorem can be reformulated as follows : for every @xmath8-fan @xmath9 and for every two nice measures @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath12 there are index @xmath13 and translation @xmath14 of an angle of @xmath15 such that @xmath16 here by an _ angle _ we mean a set consisting of a vertex , two rays from this vertex , and everything between the rays",
    ". a particular case of an angle will be a halfplane .    in this note",
    "we generalize this theorem for the case of @xmath0-fans for odd @xmath0 :    [ odd - fans ] let @xmath17 be odd . for every @xmath0-fan @xmath18 and for every two nice measures @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath12 there are index @xmath13 and a translation @xmath14 of an angle of @xmath15 such that @xmath19    and for some symmetric fans :    [ symm - fans ] theorem  [ odd - fans ] remains true for centrally symmetric fans of @xmath20 angles assuming that @xmath0 is even .",
    "the proofs of these planar theorems are rather elementary by a simple continuity argument , not requiring the borsuk ",
    "ulam type theorems like in  @xcite .",
    "what is more interesting , it is possible to find counterexamples in the cases not covered by these theorems , see section  [ section : examples ] . in the last section  [ section : noncompact ] we show that it is impossible to cut half of two measures with non - compact support with translation of an angle in general case , but some generalization of our results in that case is still possible .",
    "the authors thank alfredo hubard and the unknown referee for useful remarks and corrections .",
    "in what follows we make the standard assumptions : the measures are taken to have continuous densities and their supports are assumed to be compact and connected .",
    "the general case follows by a standard compactness argument , that we outline as follows .",
    "let all supports of the measure be contained in a big disk @xmath21 .",
    "then for every measure @xmath22 , by a convolution with a smooth kernel and a slight modification , we find a sequence of measures @xmath23 , having continuous densities and connected supports in @xmath21 , and converging to @xmath22 .",
    "the convergence is in the sense that for any angle @xmath24 we have @xmath25 .",
    "now for every @xmath0 we have an equipartitioning angle @xmath26 , and we may assume that the intersections @xmath27 converge to an intersection @xmath28 in the hausdorff metric , where @xmath24 is some angle .",
    "assuming the contrary , without loss of generality @xmath29 , we see that for a small @xmath30-neighborhood @xmath31 of @xmath24 the inequality @xmath32 retains . here",
    "we use that @xmath22 of the boundary @xmath33 and translates of this boundary slightly outside @xmath24 is zero .",
    "now , for sufficiently large @xmath0 , the convolution kernel s support may be assumed to lie in the @xmath30-neighborhood of zero , and therefore we obtain @xmath34 . also , for sufficiently large @xmath0 , the angle @xmath26 is inside @xmath31 and therefore @xmath35 , which is a contradiction .    under the above assumption of continuous density and connected support",
    "there is a unique halving line of given direction for any one of the measures .",
    "let @xmath36 be vectors collinear to the rays of the fan @xmath15 so that the angle @xmath37 lies between rays collinear to @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( counter - clockwise direction and cyclic indices )",
    ".    denote @xmath40 the set of all points @xmath41 such that @xmath42 we will call this set _ the set of @xmath43-th color for the measure @xmath22_.    the set @xmath40 contains two infinite rays @xmath44 and @xmath45 with directions of vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 that are connected by a continuous curve @xmath48 in @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be the line of direction @xmath51 that divides the measure @xmath22 into equal parts and @xmath41 an arbitrary point on this line .",
    "the function @xmath52 of positive real @xmath53 is continuous and equal to @xmath54 for sufficiently large @xmath53 because the measure @xmath22 has compact support .",
    "this construction proves the existence of a ray @xmath55    by the same reason we can find a suitable ray @xmath56 on the same line @xmath50 and take joint part of two rays as desired @xmath57    and the last point of this lemma ( existence of a curve ) is also obvious since for every prescribed projection of @xmath41 onto the direction perpendicular to the bisector of @xmath37 there is a unique such @xmath41 in @xmath40 and this @xmath41 depends continuously on the projection .",
    "let @xmath58 be the angle between rays @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these rays could have different starting points , but in that case we can take two lines containing them and choose as @xmath58 the angle with sides that have unbounded intersections with rays @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this angle is obtained from @xmath37 by a central symmetry and a translation .",
    "if rays @xmath44 and @xmath45 have opposite directions then construction of @xmath58 is obvious and it is also obtained from @xmath37 by a central symmetry and translation .",
    "assume that for some @xmath43 the angle @xmath59 is not a subset of the angle @xmath60 and @xmath60 is not a subset of @xmath59 .",
    "since these angles are translates of each other , this assumption means that their boundaries intersect and either they have a whole ray of intersection , or they intersect transversally precisely once . then two curves @xmath61 and @xmath62 have nonempty intersection too .",
    "indeed , they differ from the boundaries @xmath63 and @xmath64 by modifications on compact parts .",
    "if the boundaries had an infinite ray of intersections then these curves will do the same .",
    "if the intersection was transversal and unique then these new curves will have an odd intersection index , and therefore have nonempty intersection .",
    "so any point @xmath65 can serve as the desired vertex of a translated angle @xmath37 .",
    "now we may assume that for every @xmath43 one of @xmath59 and @xmath60 strictly contains the other . without loss of generality ,",
    "take some @xmath43 and assume that @xmath66",
    ". then boundaries of these angles are not intersecting .",
    "now we trace their `` left '' boundaries towards the infinity and note that @xmath67 is to the `` right '' of @xmath64 . here",
    "`` left '' and `` right '' are brief substitutes of `` anticlockwise '' and `` clockwise '' . but the `` left '' parts of @xmath67 and @xmath64 are also the `` right '' parts of @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively ; hence @xmath70 turns out to be a subset of @xmath71 .",
    "so we have shown that if @xmath59 contains @xmath60 then @xmath70 contains @xmath71 and vice versa . but",
    "this relation is impossible to extend over the cyclic order since @xmath0 is odd .",
    "the proof follows the same lines .",
    "we also conclude that the inclusions @xmath66 and @xmath72 alternate when @xmath43 goes around the circle . since @xmath0 is even , we have , without loss of generality , @xmath73 but the angles @xmath74 and @xmath75 share the common vertex and are opposite to each other , because they both are defined by the halving lines of @xmath10 in two directions .",
    "the same applies to @xmath76 and @xmath77 and we conclude that ( [ eq : opposite ] ) is impossible .",
    "the above proof actually works in a slightly more general case :    [ opp - rays ] the theorem @xmath78 remains true for a possibly non - symmetric fan , that contains two opposite rays with even number of angles on one side of these rays .    the same argument as for the symmetric fans with @xmath79 angles works for this case too .",
    "assume that vectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 has opposite directions . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath82 but the angles @xmath83 and @xmath84 share the common line and lie on opposite sides of this line .",
    "the same applies to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and the construction from [ eq : opposite2 ] is impossible .",
    "[ 4fan ] we start from an example of two measures and a 4-fan shown on the figure [ pict:4fan ] . each red point ( small disc ) represents one third of the measure @xmath10 , they are located in the midpoints of the regular triangle represented by dashed lines . and",
    "each blue point represents one third of the measure @xmath11 , here one point lies in the center of the red triangle .",
    "one can easily check that no angle from the fan on the right of figure  [ pict:4fan ] can divide each measure on two equal parts after a translation ( all angles of this fan are parallel to sides of the dashed triangle on the left part ) .",
    "indeed , for the top angle we observe that once its copy contains a blue point then it already contains two red points in its interior .",
    "for the angle to the left ( and the one to the right ) , we observe that once it touches at least two red points then it already contains in its interior some two of the blue points .",
    "for the angle at the bottom we observe that once it touches some two of the blue points then it already contains two red points in its interior .",
    "-fan without equipartitioning.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] 0.5 cm -fan without equipartitioning.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    similarly we can construct example of @xmath20-fan based on the regular @xmath87-gon .",
    "the @xmath20-fan consists of one angle equal to @xmath88 and @xmath89 angles equal to @xmath90 .",
    "we start from a regular @xmath87-gon and distribute the red measure @xmath10 in its midpoints of sides for even @xmath0 ( see figure  [ pict:4kfan ] ) , or in the vertices for odd @xmath0 ( see figure  [ pict:4k2fan ] ) .",
    "let the blue measure @xmath11 have @xmath91 points in the `` inner '' region of the same @xmath87-gon and additional @xmath0 points in the `` outer '' angles of the same @xmath87-gon that lie below the `` bottom '' line .",
    "this is shown in figures  [ pict:4kfan ] and [ pict:4k2fan ] .",
    "to explain this counterexample , we start with the top @xmath88 angle .",
    "any of its translations touching more than a half of the blue measure must contain the `` bottom '' line of the @xmath87-gon and therefore already contains at least @xmath0 red points in the interior .",
    "so this angle can not make an equipartition .",
    "now consider the angle @xmath92 next to the top angle .",
    "if , after a translation , it touches more than a half of the red points then it must contain in the interior the @xmath91 `` inner '' blue points ( it is seen in figures  [ pict:4kfan ] and [ pict:4k2fan ] for both cases ) and one more blue point to the left in the corresponding outer angle of the @xmath87-gon . because if an `` inner '' blue point is outside of it or on its boundary then the extension of one of its sides , passing almost through the center of the @xmath87-gon , completely separates this angle from some @xmath0 of red points .",
    "as for the next angle @xmath93 , after a translation it must touch one of the `` inner '' blue points and at least one of the `` outer '' blue points ( if it only touches `` outer '' blue points then it already contains everything ) .",
    "then it is seen from the picture that this angle will also contain in its interior some @xmath0 red vertices of the @xmath87-gon , because one of its sides is completely outside the red polygon , and the other cuts the bigger part of it .",
    "the argument for the remaining angles @xmath37 is the same depending on the parity of @xmath43 .",

    "it is easy to establish by a small case analysis that , for any such fan , it is possible to find angles @xmath92 and @xmath95 out of @xmath96 so that @xmath97 is contained in @xmath95 and @xmath98 has two connected components .",
    "now we split every measure into @xmath8 equal parts and do the following .",
    "one red point is put to the origin , two blue points are put in the respective components of @xmath99 near the origin , two red points are put in the respective components of @xmath100 much farther from the origin so that one of them is in @xmath93 and the other is in @xmath101 , and we put the remaining blue point in @xmath92 very far from the origin .",
    "then we notice the following .",
    "if @xmath95 , after a translation , touches two red points then it also contains the two blue points closer to the origin .",
    "if a translated @xmath92 touches two red points then it definitely contains in the interior one of the closer blue points and the farthest blue point . as for a translation of @xmath93 ( and analogously @xmath101 ) , if it touches some two of the blue points then it contains in the interior the red point at the origin and the other red point form the same side as @xmath93 as well .",

    "using the same approach as before we can extend theorems [ odd - fans ] and [ symm - fans ] to the case of pairs of measures with non - compact support :      as in the proof of theorem [ odd - fans ] , construct the sets @xmath102 of all possible translations of the angle @xmath37 that divides @xmath22 into equal parts .",
    "if @xmath22 has non - compact support , this set does not necessarily contain two rays parallel to the sides of the angle @xmath103 , but it can be approximated by such rays when we go sufficiently far from the origin .",
    "thus , as before we can construct similar angles @xmath104 with sides on lines parallel to rays of the fan @xmath15 that divides measures into equal parts .",
    "assume that for some @xmath43 the angle @xmath59 is not a subset of the angle @xmath60 and @xmath60 is not a subset of @xmath59 .",
    "these angles does not have a common boundary ray , and we can find a point of intersection @xmath105 and @xmath106 using the same argument of odd index of intersection of a pair of curves .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "another possible argument to prove this extension is to use going to the limit argument .",
    "the only case when we can not choose a limit of a sequence of angles @xmath26 is when the intersection of @xmath26 with every disk @xmath107 tends to a half - plane .",
    "but in this case we would obtain a half - plane cutting precisely half of every measure , which is assumed to be impossible .",
    "adding the same restriction we can modify the theorem [ symm - fans ] for measures with non - compact support .",
