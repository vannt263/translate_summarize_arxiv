    "egret detected more than 30 gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with gev emission ( schneid et al .",
    "1992 ; sommer et al . 1994 ; hurley et al . 1994 ; schaefer et al . 1998 ; gonzlez et al .",
    "the highest energy photon detected was the 18 gev photon which arrived 4500 seconds after the trigger of grb 940217 ( hurley et al .",
    "these observations motivated many interesting ideas .",
    "some focused on prompt high energy photon emission , e.g. , synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) emission or inverse compton scattering of photons emitted by one shell by electrons in another shell @xcite .",
    "others focused on high energy afterglow processes : the interaction of ultra - relativistic protons with a dense cloud ( katz 1994 ) , ssc in early forward and reverse shocks ( mszros & rees 1994 ) , electromagnetic cascade of tev @xmath1rays in the infrared / microwave background ( plaga 1995 ) , synchrotron radiation of ultra - high energy forward shock protons @xcite , and inverse compton scattering of prompt @xmath1rays by reverse shock electrons ( beloborodov 2005 ) .",
    "two kinds of high energy afterglow emission models have been discussed extensively .",
    "the first is ssc emission .",
    "motivated by the successful detection of an optical flash in grb 990123 ( akerlof et al .",
    "1999 ; sari & piran 1999 ; mszros & rees 1999 ) , wang , dai & lu ( 2001a , b ) , peer & waxman ( 2005 ) and kobayashi ( 2007 ) calculated ssc emission from the reverse shock .",
    "granot & guetta ( 2003 ) and peer & waxman ( 2004 ) applied these ideas to grb 941017 .",
    "the high energy ssc component of the forward component was calculated by dermer , chiang & mitman ( 2000 ) , sari & esin ( 2001 ) , and zhang & mszros ( 2001b ) .",
    "the second family of models involves the external inverse compton ( eic ) process .",
    "these include comptonization of the prompt photons by the forward shock electrons ( fan , zhang & wei 2005b ) , and upscattering of far - uv / x - ray flare photons ( assuming that they originate in internal shocks ) by the forward shock ( wang , li & mszros 2006 ; fan & piran 2006b ) .",
    "most of the above calculations were based on the standard afterglow model .",
    "however , recently , _",
    "swift _ has detected numerous grbs whose early ( first @xmath2 s ) afterglow emission can not be reproduced within the standard model @xcite .",
    "various modifications of the standard model have been put forward to explain the observations . however , none are compelling and the validity of the whole model is now in question .",
    "high energy emission provides a new window into afterglow physics and can provide an independent test of models .",
    "motivated by this , we calculate the predicted high energy afterglow emission in different scenarios .",
    "we show that there is a canonical high energy grb afterglow light curve which ought to be observed ( see fig . [",
    "fig : summary ] ) .",
    "the detection of the predicted high energy emission features by observations with glast or ground - based gamma - ray detectors would enable us to test the validity of the overall model as well as the specific modifications that have been put forward to explain _ swift _ observations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we review _ swift _ grb afterglow observations and their interpretation . in section [ sec",
    ": code ] we describe the methods we employ for careful calculations of the inverse compton effect ; this section may be skipped if one is interested only in the results . in section 4",
    "we calculate the ssc emission of the forward shock , and in section 5 we calculate the possible high energy emission associated with x - ray flares , including both ssc emission from within the flare and eic emission from the forward shock . in section [ sec : det ] we discuss the prospects for detecting high energy afterglows by glast and ground - based telescopes .",
    "we conclude in section 7 with a summary .",
    "in the pre-_swift _ era , most of the afterglow data was collected hours after the grb .",
    "these data were found to be consistent with the external forward shock model , though sometimes energy injection , a wind profile , or structured or patchy jets had to be invoked to account for the observations ( piran 2004 ) .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite has changed the situation . the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the uv / optical telescope ( uvot ) onboard this satellite can slew to the direction of a grb in real time and record the early broad band afterglow light curves .",
    "a schematic x - ray afterglow light curve based on the xrt data has been summarized by zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and nousek et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cartoon ] ) and consists of the following features : a very early sharp decline ( phase - i ) ; a shallow decline of the x - ray afterglow ( phase - ii ) ; a  normal \" decay phase ( phase - iii ) , possibly followed by a jet break ( phase - iv ) ; energetic x - ray flares ( phase - v ) , which may show up during any phase . note that not all of these features have been detected in every burst .",
    "we focus here on the most remarkable of the new features : the slow decline ( phase - ii ) and the flares ( phase - v ) .",
    "both are expected to have associated signatures in the high energy emission .",
    "( 0,200 ) ( 0,0 )    in about half of the _ swift _ grbs , the x - ray lightcurves show an extended flattening ( phase - ii ) . in most cases , but not all , there is no change in the spectral slope when the light curve makes a transition from the shallow phase - ii segment to the  normal \" phase - iii segment .",
    "the usual interpretation of the shallow phase is that it involves energy injection into the blast wave @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the parameter @xmath3 , which measures the fraction of shock energy transferred to the downstream electrons , varies with time ) .",
    "the interpretation of this chromatic behavior is less clear . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the cases in which the x - ray and optical light curves break achromatically . ] , as would be the case if this parameter is shock - strength dependent . in either case",
    "the corresponding ssc emission of the forward shock would be different from the one anticipated in the standard afterglow model , as well as from each other .",
    "energetic x - ray flares ( phase - v ) have been detected in several pre-_swift _ grbs and in about half the _ swift _ grbs @xcite .",
    "the rapid decline of the flares suggests that they arise due to  late internal shocks \" resulting from reactivation of the central engine @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the x - ray flares arise due to refreshed shocks @xcite .",
    "once again , the gev emission can serve to distinguish between the models .",
    "if the flares are produced by internal shocks , most of the up - scattered photons would arrive after the far - uv / x - ray flare .",
    "the high energy photons in this scenario will be produced by scattering of the flare photons in the external shock . in the eic process ,",
    "the duration of the high energy emission is stretched by the spherical curvature of the blast wave ( beloborodov 2005 ; wang et al .",
    "2006 ; fan & piran 2006b ) and is further extended by the highly anisotropic distribution of the up - scattered photons ( fan & piran 2006b ; see our fig.[fig : ww ] for a comparison ) . for the latter effect ,",
    "see aharonian & atoyan ( 1981 ) , ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and brunetti ( 2001 ) for details .",
    "the relativistic electrons that are present in any synchrotron source will also produce very high energy photons via inverse compton scattering ( either ssc or eic ) .",
    "we turn now to a calculation of this emission . when the energy of the electrons and the seed photons is sufficiently large it is necessary to take into account the klein - nishina correction to the scattering cross section .",
    "we also need to include the inverse compton cooling in calculating the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons .",
    "the essential problem is to calculate carefully the compton parameter , @xmath4 , the ratio between the power loss through inverse compton scattering and synchroton radiation ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ) : @xmath7 throughout this work , the superscript @xmath8 indicates that the quantity is measured in the rest frame of the emitting region . in the regime of thomson scattering",
    ", @xmath4 is a constant , independent of the electron lorentz factor @xmath9 , and one obtains a constant reduction in the amplitude of the synchrotron emission compared to the case with no inverse compton scattering .",
    "this makes computations relatively easy .",
    "however , in the general case , since the klein - nishina correction to @xmath4 depends on @xmath9 , the effect of inverse compton scattering on the spectrum and on the electron energy distribution is non - trivial .",
    "the power emitted in synchrotron radiation by an electron with lorentz factor @xmath9 is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding spectral energy distribution of the radiation is @xmath12 { d\\nu'\\over \\nu'_{\\rm s}(\\ge)},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the power emitted via inverse compton scattering is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the frequency of the photon after scattering .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is the scattered photon spectrum per electron ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) .",
    "it is related to the spectral energy distribution of the inverse compton radiation emitted by an electron : @xmath19    we define the auxiliary quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is the photon energy before scattering .",
    "the factor @xmath24 determines the regime of scattering , with the thomson limit corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "the factor @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27 ( jones 1968 ; blumenthal & gould 1970 ) .",
    "we can express @xmath28 in terms of these quantities and in terms of the frequency distribution of the seed photons @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "\\label{eq : jones1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to complete the calculation we need to know the frequency distribution of seed photons @xmath29 . for eic",
    "this is simple since the photons originate from an external source . for ssc",
    ", however , the situation is more complicated .",
    "this is because the photons are produced via synchrotron emission by the same electrons that are participating in inverse compton scattering .",
    "the additional cooling of these electrons by ic influences their energy distribution and thus their synchrotron emission .",
    "we have solved this problem by two different approaches .",
    "first , we have used a simple `` instantaneous '' approach which involves a single integral equation .",
    "this method , which we describe in section 3.1 , is conceptually simple and computationally fast .",
    "it is , however , approximate .",
    "we then describe in section 3.2 a more detailed and general dynamical approach .",
    "this more accurate method is the one we have used for all the calculations presented later in this paper .",
    "however , the two methods give very similar results in a very wide energy range , as seen in fig.[fig : ramesh_yizhong ] .      in this approach",
    "we assume a functional form for the electron energy distribution @xmath31 produced through acceleration in the shock front , and consider its instantaneous modification due to cooling .",
    "an electron of lorentz factor @xmath32 has a cooling time given by @xmath33 if @xmath34 is longer than the dynamical time @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the radius of the shock front relative to the central engine and @xmath37 is the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow , then the electron produces synchrotron and ic emission for the entire time @xmath38 .",
    "however , when @xmath34 is shorter than @xmath38 , the electron radiates only for a time @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the total spectral radiation density produced by all the electrons in the fluid is given by @xmath39 \\ ,",

    "we write eq .",
    "( [ eq : ramesh1 ] ) as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the klein - nishina cross - section , which is equal to @xmath44 + { 1\\over2g}\\ln(1 + 2g)-{(1 + 3g)\\over ( 1 + 2g)^2 } \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equation ( [ inteq ] ) is an integral equation , since the function @xmath45 inside the integral itself depends on @xmath46 .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 is the smallest @xmath32 down to which electrons are present . in dealing with equation ( [ inteq ] )",
    "we need to consider two cases ( see sari , piran & narayan 1998 for details and for the definitions of quantities ) :    * slow cooling * : in this case , electrons with @xmath48 have a cooling time @xmath49 . then , @xmath50 , and we may use equation ( [ inteq ] ) directly with @xmath51 and @xmath52 given by the original energy distribution produced in the shock .    *",
    "fast cooling * : here , all electrons with @xmath53 have @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , electrons will continue to cool below @xmath55 to a minimum @xmath47 such that @xmath56 now , for the range @xmath57 , all the electrons are available for radiating .",
    "initially , most of the electrons are at @xmath58 , and as these electrons cool each electron will pass every @xmath9 between @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( where all these electrons accumulate ) .",
    "hence we have @xmath60    as usual , we assume a power - law distribution for the electron lorentz factor : @xmath61 for which @xmath55 is given by ( sari et al . 1998 ) @xmath62    equation ( [ inteq ] ) may be solved numerically via an iterative method .",
    "the algorithm proceeds as follows .",
    "we begin with some reasonable initial approximation for @xmath46 . using this , we compute @xmath63 , @xmath34 and @xmath47 .",
    "then , we compute the spectral distributions @xmath64 and @xmath65 for all @xmath66 and obtain via equation ( [ inteq ] ) a new approximation for @xmath46 .",
    "we take this @xmath46 , or ( for smoother convergence ) a suitable linear combination of the new and old @xmath46 , as the current approximation for @xmath46 and repeat the steps .",
    "the iteration usually converges fairly quickly .",
    "this approach can be combined with any desired model for the grb fireball and afterglow dynamics .",
    "we have used the dynamics described in sari ( 1998 ) , except that we multiplied the calculated fluxes by a factor of 1/4 ( cf . , yost et al .",
    "2003 ) .      in this approach",
    "we follow dynamically the electron distribution as a function of time @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainty is from the approximation for the initial distribution of the newly shocked electrons as a function of time . lacking a better model , we assume that the electrons are accelerated at the shock wave initially to a single power law distribution : @xmath67 where the maximal lorentz factor is given by @xmath68 ( wei & cheng 1997 ) .",
    "the normalization factor satisfies : @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the number density of the medium .",
    "we now follow the evolution of the electron distribution using : @xmath71 where @xmath72\\gamma_e^2-{\\gamma_e \\over r } , \\label{eq : fan1}\\ ] ] @xmath37 is the bulk lorentz factor of the shocked medium , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the magnetic energy density . as usual",
    ", we assume that a fraction @xmath3 ( @xmath75 ) of the shock energy density is converted into energy of relativistic electrons ( magnetic field ) .    to complete the calculations we need the location and the lorentz factor of the blast wave as a function of time .",
    "the dynamics of the blast wave is obtained by solving the differential equations presented by huang et al .",
    "the possible ( but poorly understood ) sideways expansion of the ejecta is ignored .",
    "we then calculate the electron distribution using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fan0 ] ) and the supplemental relations . the quantity @xmath29 needed in eq.([eq : jones1 ] ) is calculated via ( for simplicity , we consider only single scattering ) : @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( the term @xmath78 is introduced by the shock jump condition ) , @xmath79 is the time that the synchrotron radiation photons stay within the shocked medium , and @xmath80 is the lorentz factor below which the synchrotron approximation becomes invalid .",
    "once we know the energy distribution of the electrons , we calculate the synchrotron and inverse compton emission , including synchrotron - self - absorption , and we integrate the observed flux over the  equal - arrival time surfaces \" ( rees 1966 ; waxman 1997 ; sari 1998 ; granot , piran & sari 1999 ) . in the current code , we did not take into account the influence of the synchrotron - self - absorption on the electron distribution , as that done in peer & waxman ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , with typical grb afterglow parameters adopted in this work , for @xmath81 ( at late times , the high energy emission are usually too low to be of our interest ) , it is straightforward to show that the random lorentz factor of the electrons emitting at the synchrotron - self - absorption frequency @xcite is @xmath82 .",
    "the modification of the low energy electron s distribution through the synchrotron - self - absorption is thus unlikely to influence the high energy spectrum significantly .    in fig .",
    "2 , we compare the spectral distributions calculated via the simple instantaneous approach of sec .",
    "3.1 and the more detailed dynamical approach of this subsection .",
    "the two methods are clearly consistent with each other .",
    "this gives us confidence in the validity of both calculations .",
    "note that the multiple inverse compton scattering are ignored in our dynamical approach but are included in the instantaneous approximation .",
    "the consistence between these two approaches suggests that the multiple inverse compton scattering is not important , at least for the typical grb afterglow parameters ( see also sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "( 0,200 ) ( 0,0 )    in the case of eic , the seed photon energy distribution is not influenced by the electron energy distribution . from this point of view",
    "the calculations are simpler .",
    "however there is another complication , viz .",
    ", for the cases of interest to us , the seed photons are highly anisotropic in the rest frame of the blast wave .",
    "the spectrum of radiation scattered at an angle @xmath83 relative to the direction of the photon beam penetrating through this region is @xcite : @xmath84 , \\label{eq : aa81}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the angle between the line of sight and the emitting point , @xmath90 is the velocity of the emitting point , and @xmath91 . as expected , on integration over @xmath83 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : aa81 ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : jones1 ] ) .",
    "the energy loss rate of the hot electron beam can be estimated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_compt ] ) and @xmath92 is governed by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : y_gamma]-[eq : jones1 ] ) for a given @xmath29 ( see  [ sec : eic ] for details ) .",
    "the dominant source of long lasting high energy grb afterglow emission is ssc of the hot electrons in the forward external shock . at early stages",
    "when the cooling of most electrons is important , the luminosity of the ssc emission , @xmath93 , is related to the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation , @xmath94 , as @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the compton parameter .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath97 is a small fraction of @xmath94 but we can use it as a proxy for the total luminosity . to do",
    "so we define a factor @xmath98 such that @xmath99 and : @xmath100 as long as @xmath98 does not vary significantly with time , we expect the broad - band ssc afterglow light curve and the x - ray light curve to have a similar temporal behavior .",
    "we expect , therefore , that @xmath101 and @xmath102 should be highly correlated .",
    "this is , of course , confirmed by more detailed analysis , as shown below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lssc_lx ] ) .",
    "the light curve depends on the dynamics of the blast wave and in particular on the evolution with time of @xmath103 , the power given to the shocked electrons ( see eq . [",
    "eq : l_electron ] ) .",
    "we consider first the evolution expected in the standard afterglow model and then discuss various modifications to the model .",

    "we note that @xmath103 depends only weakly on the density profile . here and throughout this text , the convention @xmath117 has been adopted in cgs units .",
    "the ssc luminosity can be estimated as : @xmath118 all the physics in this equation is , of course , hidden in the factor @xmath119 , which depends , in turn , on the synchrotron and cooling frequencies , @xmath120 and @xmath121 @xcite , and on the power law index of the electron distribution , @xmath122 : @xmath123 where @xcite : @xmath124 the ratio of the synchrotron and cooling frequencies satisfies @xcite : @xmath125 where @xmath126 $ ] .",

    "<S> we focus on two processes : synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission within the afterglow blast wave , and external inverse compton ( eic ) emission which occurs when flare photons ( produced by an internal process ) pass through the blast wave . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if our current interpretations of the swift xrt data are correct , there should be a canonical high energy afterglow emission light curve . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions can be tested with high energy observatories such as glast , whipple , h.e.s.s . and magic . </S>",
