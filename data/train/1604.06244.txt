    "the casimir effect ( for reviews see @xcite ) is among the most interesting boundary - induced effects in quantum field theory .",
    "nearly seventy years after its discovery , the effect continues to be area of active theoretical and experimental research today .",
    "this is due to of fundamental and practical importance of the casimir effect in various fields of modern physics and technology .",
    "the imposition of boundary conditions on a quantum field shifts the expectation values of physical observables .",
    "the particular features of the effect depend on the spin of the field , on the geometries of boundaries and background spacetime , and on the specific boundary conditions .",
    "an interesting topic in the investigations of the casimir effect is the dependence of the physical characteristics , such as the vacuum energy and forces acting on the boundaries , on the dimension of the background spacetime . in particular , this is motivated by the role of the casimir effect in higher - dimensional models .",
    "the dependence of the casimir energy on the size of the extra dimensions provides a mechanism for their stabilization .",
    "the latter is an important issue in both the kaluza - klein - type and braneworld models .",
    "in addition , the casimir energy related to extra dimensions can serve as a model of dark energy driving the accelerating expansion of the universe at recent epoch .    in the present paper we investigate combined effects of boundaries and background geometry on the local characteristics of the electromagnetic vacuum in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions .",
    "as a background spacetime we consider @xmath0-dimensional de sitter ( ds ) spacetime .",
    "this choice is motivated by several reasons . the ds spacetime has maximal number of symmetries and because of this a large number of physical problems can be solved exactly on its background",
    ". a better understanding of the influence of classical gravitational field on quantum matter in ds spacetime serves as a way to deal with less symmetric geometries .",
    "the quantum effects in ds bulk play an important role in inflationary scenarios ( see @xcite and mart13 for recent reviews ) . quantum fluctuations in the inflationary universe with ds geometry produce observable effects in the form of small density perturbations in the post - inflationary stage .",
    "these perturbations have nearly scale - invariant spectrum and form the base of the currently most popular mechanism for the generation of the seeds for galaxy formation .",
    "the corresponding predictions are in good agreement with the recent observational data on the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation . the importance of ds spacetime as a gravitational background further increased after the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe at recent epoch @xcite . within the framework of general relativity , among the most popular cosmological models",
    "is the one with a positive cosmological constant as a driving source behind the accelerating expansion . in this model",
    "the ds spacetime is the future attractor for the geometry of our universe .",
    "an important ingredient in the problems of the casimir effect is the geometry of boundaries .",
    "here we consider a cylindrical shell in background of ds spacetime , described by inflationary coordinates . on the shell the electromagnetic field obeys the generalized perfect conductor boundary condition . along with the boundaries of planar and spherical symmetry , the cylindrical boundaries are among the most popular geometries in the investigations of the casimir effect ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the patch of ds spacetime covered by inflationary coordinates is conformally flat and the corresponding results for the casimir effect in the case of conformally invariant fields are obtained from the expressions for the minkowski bulk by using the standard conformal relation between two problems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", this is the case for the electromagnetic field in 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the case of conformally coupled massless scalar field obeying dirichlet boundary condition on a spherical shell in 4-dimensional ds spacetime has been considered in @xcite .    for conformally non - invariant fields the investigation of the casimir effect in ds spacetime requires a separate consideration . in this case , at distances from the boundaries larger than the curvature radius of the background spacetime , the influence of the gravitational field may lead to a behavior of the local characteristics of the vacuum essentially different from that in the minkowski bulk .",
    "the scalar casimir effect for a massive field with general curvature coupling and with robin boundary conditions on planar boundaries in the background of @xmath0-dimensional ds spacetime has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding problem with a spherical boundary was discussed in @xcite .",
    "an important feature for conformally non - invariant fields is that the vacuum energy - momentum tensor , in addition to the diagonal components , acquires an off - diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the direction normal to the boundary .",
    "the casimir densities induced by a spherical ds bubble in the minkowski bulk has been studied in @xcite . for a scalar field ,",
    "the geometry with a cylindrical boundary with robin boundary condition was discussed in saha15 .",
    "depending on the mass of the field , at distances from the boundaries larger than the ds curvature radius , two different regimes are realized with monotonic or oscillatory decay of the vacuum expectation values . the electromagnetic casimir effect for planar boundaries with generalized perfect conductor boundary conditions in ds bulk , having an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions ,",
    "has recently been studied in saha14 ( for the propagators of vector fields on ds background in the absence of boundaries see @xcite ) .",
    "the background geometry of friedmann - robertson - walker cosmologies with power - law scale factors was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in the next section we consider the complete set of cylindrical modes for the electromagnetic field in ds spacetime , obeying the generalized perfect conductor boundary condition on a cylindrical shell . by using these modes , in section sec : e2 , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the electric field squared inside the shell is evaluated .",

    "<S> complete set of cylindrical modes is constructed for the electromagnetic field inside and outside a cylindrical shell in the background of @xmath0-dimensional ds spacetime . on the shell , the field obeys the generalized perfect conductor boundary condition . for the bunch - davies vacuum state </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the expectation values ( vevs ) of the electric field squared and of the energy - momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the shell - induced contributions are explicitly extracted . in this way , for points away from the shell </S>",
    "<S> , the renormalization is reduced to the one for the vevs in the boundary - free ds bulk . as a special case , </S>",
    "<S> the vevs are obtained for a cylindrical shell in the @xmath0-dimensional minkowski bulk . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the shell - induced contribution in the electric field squared is positive for both the interior and exterior regions . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding casimir - polder forces are directed toward the shell . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy - momentum tensor , in addition to the diagonal components , has a nonzero off - diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the direction normal to the shell . </S>",
    "<S> this flux is directed from the shell in both the exterior and interior regions . for points near the shell , </S>",
    "<S> the leading terms in the asymptotic expansions for the electric field squared and diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor are obtained from the corresponding expressions in the minkowski bulk replacing the distance from the shell by the proper distance in the ds bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the gravitational field on the local characteristics of the vacuum is essential at distances from the shell larger than the ds curvature radius . </S>",
    "<S> the results are extended for confining boundary conditions of flux tube models in qcd .    </S>",
