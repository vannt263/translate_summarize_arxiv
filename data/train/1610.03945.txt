    "clustering objects based on their similarities is a basic data mining approach in statistical analysis .",
    "in particular , graph data ( or , network data ) that reflect relationships between nodes , are often acquired in various scientific domains such as protein - protein interaction , neural network and social network @xcite , which potentially provides quite useful information on the underlying structure of the system in question .",
    "specifically , our interest is to detect a possible community ,  or cluster structure of undirected graph , which is defined as block structure of a graph ( fig.[repmat]a ) , where the corresponding edge - weight matrix consists of several cluster blocks ( four cluster blocks in fig.[repmat]b ) . to detect such structure ,",
    "a number of clustering methods have been proposed in the literature of statistical physics and information theory @xcite .",
    "mainly , there are four approaches : graph partitioning , hierarchical clustering , partitional clustering and spectral clustering @xcite .    however , the conventional framework for analysis of community structure is typically for an unsigned graph in which an edge weight is constrained to be non - negative .",
    "recently , it has gained much attention to analyze a signed graph that allows for negative weights @xcite .",
    "indeed , in real data , it is often essential to take into account negative as well as positive relationship for a better understanding of the underlying community structure in a graph such as social network .",
    "most methods in literature , however , address this problem in a rather limited framework in which edge weights within a cluster are positive while those between clusters negative ( i.e. , weakly balanced structure ) @xcite . on the other hand , it still remains an open question as how to cluster nodes in a more general framework such as negative edge weights within a cluster @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider a general framework for community structure as follows .",
    "we assume that edge weights are independently generated from a generative model that is specific to a particular cluster block , which characterizes a distribution of edges in each cluster block .",
    "further , we assume that these distributions are distinguishable in terms of their mean and variance . for this framework , as a first step of addressing a clustering problem",
    ", we aim to develop a statistical method for testing the existence of the underlying community structure .",
    "as regards statistical test on community structure , several methods have been proposed in the context of unsigned ( weighted or unweighted ) graph @xcite .",
    "a major approach to this problem is to evaluate the stability of cluster solutions when the graph in question is contaminated with noise @xcite .",
    "if similar cluster solutions are yielded for contaminated graphs , it suggests the stability of the cluster solution for the original graph , providing the evidence of the community structure .",
    "the bootstrap method @xcite is in the similar line with this approach .",
    "a second approach is based on comparison of the cluster solution for the original graph with those solutions of randomly permuted graphs . as a statistic for testing the significance , the entropy of graph configurations @xcite , or c - score  focusing on the lowest internal degrees @xcite have been proposed .",
    "the common feature of these state - of - the - art methods is that a cluster solution to the graph in question is required for testing . in other words ,",
    "the test result depends on a clustering method that one uses . in this sense , these methods test the significance of a yielded cluster solution , rather than the existence of community structure itself . for the general framework of our interest ,",
    "such an approach is not applicable because appropriate clustering methods are not readily available .",
    "we propose a general method for testing community structure of edge - weighted graph with real - valued weights , which does not require a cluster solution .",
    "our method is based on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the normalized weight matrix of graph , which is described by wigner semicircular law when there is no community structure . in the similar line with our approach , in the case of binary - valued graph ,",
    "a statistical test on community structure has been recently proposed @xcite that is based on the exact asymptotic behavior of ( maximum ) eigenvalues .",
    "however , their method is not directly applicable to real - valued graphs where we take into account both mean and variance , because bernoulli distribution assumed in their method can not properly capture these quantities .",
    "our method provides a nontrivial extension of detecting community structure to real - valued graphs , which has a wide range of applications to network data . in the following sections , first",
    ", a theoretical foundation for our method is provided .",
    "second , it is shown that our method outperforms other methods in synthetic data .",
    "third , we apply our method to real data .",
    "our statistical test on community structure is based on the probability distribution of eigenvalues of the normalized edge - weight matrix ( we define normalization  in section  [ stattest ] ) .",
    "we make the best use of asymptotic results on such a distribution when there is no community structure , which have been intensively studied in the field of random matrix theory of theoretical physics @xcite . in this section",
    ", we provide a theoretical foundation for our statistical test .",
    "+      we consider a clustering problem of nodes for undirected edge - weighted graph @xmath0 where @xmath1 consists of @xmath2 vertices @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is represented by the edge - weight matrix @xmath5 , which is a @xmath6 symmetric ( real hermitian ) matrix with elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 denotes a set of real numbers ) .",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath10 clusters of nodes , denoting them as @xmath11 .",
    "we define a cluster block @xmath12 as a set of weights @xmath13 such that nodes @xmath14 and @xmath15 belong to the cluster @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively : @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . here",
    ", we assume that each off - diagonal weight @xmath13 is independently drawn from a certain distribution . with this assumption ,",
    "we define a @xmath10-way community structure as characterized by different distributions in @xmath21 cluster blocks . to elaborate this definition ,",
    "we assume the following distribution for each cluster block : @xmath22 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath23 is a certain probability distribution .",
    "this definition suggests that a pair of parameters @xmath24 characterizes each cluster block , hence , community structure ( fig.[f2]a ) .",
    "note that in this definition we exclude the degenerate case that @xmath25 and @xmath26 in which the variances become zero for the whole set of @xmath27 .    since the community structure of our interest",
    "is based on differences of weight distributions , it is translation and scale invariant for the whole weights .",
    "hence , to simplify the problem , as a preprocess , we standardize off - diagonal elements of @xmath5 using all off - diagonal weights @xmath28 so that the mean is zero and the variance one .",
    "we denote as @xmath29 the mapping that standardizes edge - weight matrix in this way , transforming each element of the matrix as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mean and the standard deviation of the whole off - diagonal elements @xmath33 .",
    "practically , these mean and standard deviation may be replaced by the empirical counterparts @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for the standardized edge - weight matrix @xmath36",
    ", we assume that the mean and the variance of @xmath23 in eq.([settingw ] ) are zero and one , respectively . in this",
    "setting , the mean and the variance in cluster block @xmath12 are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the differences of these parameters distinguish between clusters in terms of the first and second moments , while controlling higher moments than two . using this setting of community structure ,",
    "we define no community case as a single community with @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath36 .",
    "note that since @xmath23 is arbitrary , including a mixture distribution of certain distribution family , our definition of no community structure includes the case that each weight is generated from a specific distribution in a list of distributions in random order .",
    "importantly , when we shuffle the off - diagonal elements @xmath5 at random ( in element - wise manner ) , the community structure always disappears .",
    "indeed , in such a case , each element @xmath42 of the shuffled matrix @xmath43 independently and identically follows the mixture distribution consisting of different components , i.e. , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the proportion of elements of cluster block @xmath12 for the original matrix @xmath5 .",
    "we use this property for our statistical test as an alternative way for estimating confidential intervals ( section  [ stattest ] ) .      in this section ,",
    "we develop a statistical test on the existence of community structure defined in section [ setting ] ( i.e. , @xmath39 vs. @xmath46 ) .",
    "we base our test on the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of @xmath36 as the number of nodes @xmath2 goes to @xmath47 when there is no community structure .",
    "a useful result of random matrix theory in our context is that if the elements of an infinite dimensional symmetric matrix @xmath48 independently follow a certain distribution with mean zero and variance one , then the empirical ( random ) distribution of eigenvalue @xmath49 of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the principal submatrix of @xmath48 for the first @xmath2 rows and columns , converges almost surely to wigner semicircular distribution as @xmath2 goes to @xmath47 ( semicircular law ) @xcite : @xmath52 note that this law holds for any generative distribution of the elements in matrix @xmath48 ( as long as independently drawn ) , which is referred to as universality property of the law .",
    "also , this law holds even if we replace the diagonal elements by zero s .    in order to apply the semicircular law to our context",
    ", we consider a normalization mapping of edge - weight matrix @xmath5 , transforming each element of the matrix as @xmath53 where @xmath29 is the standardization mapping in eq.([s ] ) . now , let us assume that the elements in an edge - weight matrix @xmath5 are generated as in eq.([settingw ] ) . in this setting , the semicircular law suggests that if the eigenvalues of @xmath54 for sufficiently large @xmath2 do not follow wigner semicircular distribution in eq.([semicircular ] ) , then , there should be some @xmath10-way community structure in the graph ( @xmath46 ) because of our assumption in eq.([settingw ] ) ) , this property does not hold .",
    "for instance , one can make a scale - free graph where the eigenvalues do not follow the semicircular law @xcite . ] .",
    "however , the converse argument does not necessarily hold . that is to say ,",
    "the fact that the eigenvalues of @xmath54 follow wigner semicircular distribution does not imply that there is no community structure ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) .",
    "a counter example is given as follows ( proof in appendix  [ semicircular1 ] ) .",
    "[ theory counter ] let @xmath5 be a @xmath55 symmetric edge - weight matrix that has @xmath10-way community structure with the same cluster size ( @xmath56 ) as defined in section  [ setting ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath40 for @xmath57 , @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "then , the empirical eigenvalue distribution of @xmath54 almost surely converges to wigner semicircular distribution in eq.([semicircular ] ) as @xmath2 goes to @xmath47 .    nonetheless , in our setting",
    ", we can show that an additional condition on the eigenvalue distribution for an exponentially mapped edge - weight matrix ensures that the converse argument also holds .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce the exponential mapping @xmath61 that transforms each element of @xmath5 as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a tuning parameter ( we do not explicitly denote the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath64 because of cluttering ) .",
    "subsequently , we define the normalization mapping @xmath65 for the exponentially transformed matrix as @xmath66    now , the following theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of community structure ( proof in appendix  [ semicircular2 ] ) .",
    "[ theory1 ]",
    "let @xmath5 be a @xmath55 weight matrix defined in section  [ setting ] with the fixed proportion of cluster sizes @xmath67 and the pairs of parameters @xmath68 .",

    "then , the following statements ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) are equivalent :    * ( c1 ) there is no community structure ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) * ( c2 ) the empirical eigenvalue distribution of the following two matrices almost surely converges to wigner semicircular distribution in eq.([semicircular ] ) as @xmath2 goes to @xmath47 : @xmath54 and @xmath70 for some real value @xmath71 .    theorem  [ theory1 ]",
    ". however , the square transformation seems to have less power when we establish a statistical test ( as in the following paragraphs ) , possibly because it is not one - to - one mapping .",
    "this observation motivates us to work on the exponential mapping . ] motivates us to use the semicircular law to establish a statistical test on the null hypothesis @xmath72 : @xmath73    as has been implied in the proof of theorem  [ theory1 ] , the violation of the semicircular law for @xmath54 is related to differences of means ( @xmath37 ) among cluster blocks , while the violation of the law for @xmath70 related to differences of variances ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "hence , if we take into account the eigenvalues of these two matrices , we can capture differences of the first and second moments of the underlying distributions among cluster blocks . practically , to test the null hypothesis @xmath72 , rather than dealing with the distribution of the whole eigenvalues , we focus on extreme values of eigenvalues , because the proof of theorem  [ theory1 ] suggests that the extreme eigenvalues may be closely related to the violation of the semicircular law when there is community structure .",
    "the largest eigenvalue may be positively deviated from the expected value @xmath74 , or the smallest eigenvalue may be negatively deviated from the expected value @xmath75 . note that strictly speaking , the independent assumption on weights is broken if we transform them by @xmath76 or @xmath65 using empirical mean and standard deviation @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "for simplicity , however , we ignore such an effect here .",
    "the behavior of the largest eigenvalue has been well studied in literature when elements of edge - weight matrix @xmath5 are independently generated by certain symmetric distribution @xmath23 ( typically gaussian , otherwise , its density function may be even with less heavier tails than gaussian distribution ) with mean zero and variance one for non - diagonal elements and with mean zero and variance two for diagonal elements . in this setting ,",

    "note that tracy - widom distribution is for the maximum eigenvalue of specific type of symmetric matrix ( e.g. , gaussian ensembles ) while the semicircular law holds for the distribution of eigenvalues in general type of symmetric matrix ( wigner ensembles ) .",
    "moreover , in our framework , the diagonal elements are all zero , which is in a slightly different situation than the conventional assumption for tracy - widom distribution . nevertheless ,",
    "because of the universality property of tracy - widom distribution ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 21.4.3 , ) , we can safely apply eq.([f1 ] ) to our context ( obviously , our context satisfies the condition of universality that the diagonal part should be symmetric with a sub - gaussian tail ) .    using tracy - widom distribution in eq.([f1 ] ) , we set confidence intervals for our statistical test as follows . for the normalized edge - weight matrix @xmath54 , we set the confidence interval @xmath86 of the largest eigenvalue @xmath77 at level @xmath87 . since the violation of the semicircular law occurs as the positive deviation from the expected value",

    "if the generative distribution @xmath23 may not be symmetric or it may be heavy - tailed , one may evaluate the distribution of the largest eigenvalues by means of permutation test for @xmath54 , though it may require some computation time .",
    "in addition to the largest eigenvalue , we also consider to test the smallest eigenvalue @xmath92 , which may cause the violation of the semicircular law ( what matters is indeed the largest magnitude of eigenvalue ) . in this case , the confidence interval @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 . in the similar manner , we consider to test the largest and the smallest eigenvalue of the exponentially normalized weight matrix .",

    "as regards clustering , to the best of our knowledge , there is no clustering method that is specifically designed to detect community structure based on differences of patterns of distributions . as a bail - out procedure , we consider one of the state - of - the - art methods for signed networks : signed spectral clustering based on normalized signed laplacian method ( signedspec ) , which is designed to detect the weakly balanced structure of graph , i.e. , positive weights within a cluster and negative weights between clusters @xcite .",

    "therefore , the eigenvalues that are relevant for cluster block @xmath132 are those eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath147 .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of these eigenvalues follows the semicircular law as @xmath2 goes to @xmath47 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "in our setting , if there is no community structure , then , the eigenvalues of @xmath54 and the eigenvalues of @xmath70 follow the semicircular law because of universality property of the law .",
    "now , we prove the converse . for this purpose",
    ", we prove that if there is community structure , then , it violates the semicircular law .",
    "first , we consider the situation that there is community structure such that some of means @xmath37 in @xmath36 differ , while variances @xmath148 in @xmath36 are the same across different cluster blocks .",
    "note that means and variances are defined for the standardized matrix @xmath36 . for simplicity of notation , we denote the normalized weight matrix ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) as @xmath5 .",
    "the matrix @xmath5 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the normalized mean matrix , @xmath151 where @xmath152 ; @xmath133 the number of nodes in the @xmath125th cluster ; @xmath153 a @xmath154 vector with elements one . by the dual weyl inequality @xcite (",
    "note that both @xmath155 and @xmath150 are symmetric matrices ) , @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the @xmath14th eigenvalue of matrix @xmath158 in descending order .",
    "letting @xmath159 and @xmath160 , @xmath161 the eigenvalues of @xmath155 follow the semicircular law from its definition . from the semicircular law and bai - yin theorem @xcite",
    "( because of the existence of the moment - generating function , the fourth moment exists ) , the eigenvalue @xmath162 almost surely converges to @xmath75 as @xmath163 . on the other hand",
    ", we evaluate a lower bound of @xmath164 as follows .",
    "the number of nodes @xmath133 is given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the proportion of the nodes in that cluster .",
    "the largest magnitude of eigenvalues is given by the operator norm : @xmath167 for simplicity , we assume the left - hand side is given by the largest eigenvalue @xmath164 ( the following argument is applicable when it is @xmath168 as well ) .",
    "we evaluate a lower bound of @xmath164 using eq.([operator ] ) . letting @xmath169 with @xmath170 , @xmath171 hence , @xmath172 where @xmath173 .",
    "because of our assumption , there exists non zero @xmath37 in eq.([epi ] ) .",
    "this suggests that by appropriately choosing @xmath174 , it becomes that @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath5 in eq.([eq2 ] ) takes ( infinitely ) larger value than 2 as @xmath2 goes to @xmath47 .",
    "this implies the violation of the semicircular that we aim to prove .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the variances of cluster block are the same in @xmath101 .",
    "we relax this condition .",
    "let us assume that variances differ .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath162 in eq.([eq2 ] ) is lower bounded .",
    "we prove this when @xmath176 , but the proof can be easily extended to @xmath177 case . by the dual weyl inequality , @xmath178 where @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the submatrix of @xmath181 for cluster block @xmath182 , and @xmath183 . since each diagonal block of @xmath184 follows the semicircular law up to scale , @xmath185 . on the other hand , we augment the diagonal blocks for the symmetric matrix @xmath186 by generating elements from the same distribution as in its off - diagonal blocks .",
    "@xmath187 where @xmath188 is the augmented matrix and @xmath189 the diagonal block matrix .",
    "again , by the dual weyl inequality , @xmath190 since the eigenvalues of @xmath188 and the eigenvalues of @xmath191 follow the semicircular law up to scale , it becomes that @xmath192 is lower bounded .",
    "hence , it is concluded that @xmath193 is also lower bounded .",
    "second , we consider the case when means are zero , but some variances differ across cluster blocks . in such a case , we consider the exponential transformation of the edge - weight @xmath101 where @xmath194 . by definition , the expectation of the new variable @xmath195 is evaluated at @xmath196 by the moment - generating function @xmath197 for the distribution of @xmath13 in block @xmath12 where @xmath198 is given by @xmath199 . in general , the probability distribution is uniquely determined by the corresponding moment - generating function in an open interval containing zero @xcite .",
    "so , if some cluster blocks have different distributions , there exists @xmath95 near zero such that some of @xmath200 differ for some real @xmath71 .",
    "this suggests that some means of the new variables differ . moreover , if we take @xmath95 small enough such that @xmath201 exists ( i.e. , at least the fourth moment exists for the exponentially transformed variables ; indeed , it is possible to do so , because @xmath95 can be taken as much small as one wants ) , then , the same argument ( that we have developed in the first case of different means ) can be applied to this case about the violation of the semicircular law ( because bai - yin theory is also applicable to this case ) .",
    "this completes the proof that if there is community structure , then , the semicircular law is violated ."
