    "it has long been speculated that a single mechanism might be at work in the production and collimation of various very energetic observed jets , such as those in gamma ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite , and jets ejected from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite and from microquasars @xcite . here",
    "we limit ourselves to jets produced by a black hole ( bh ) type core .",
    "the most often invoked process is the blandford - znajek @xcite or some closely similar mechanism ( e.g.  @xcite ) in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics , always requiring a magnetic field .",
    "however such mechanisms are limited to charged particles , and would be inefficient for neutral particles ( neutrons , neutrinos and photons ) , which are currently the presumed antecedents of very thin and long duration grb @xcite . moreover , even for charged particles , some questions persist ( see for instance the conclusion of @xcite ) . finally ,",
    "while the observations of synchrotron radiation prove the presence of magnetic fields , they do not prove that those fields alone cause the collimation : magnetic mechanisms may be only a part of a more unified mechanism for explaining the origin and collimation of powerful jets , see @xcite p.  234 and",
    "section 5 , and , in particular , for collimation of jets from agn to subparsec scales , see @xcite .    considering this background ,",
    "it is worthwhile looking for other types of model to explain the origin and structure of jets .",
    "other models based on a purely general relativistic origin for jets have been considered .",
    "a simple model was obtained by @xcite by assuming the centres of galaxies are described by a cylindrical rotating dust .",
    "that paper showed that confinement occurs in the radial motion of test particles while the particles are accelerated in the axial direction thus producing jets .",
    "another relativistic model was put forward in @xcite .",
    "this showed that the sign of the proper acceleration of test particles near the axis of symmetry of quasi - spherical objects and close to the horizon can change .",
    "such an outward acceleration , that can be very big , might cause the production of jets .",
    "however , these models show a powerful gravitational effect of repulsion only near the axis , and are built in the framework of axisymmetric stationary metrics which do not have an asymptotic behaviour compatible with possible far away observations .",
    "so we want to explore the more realistic rotating black hole , i.e.  kerr , metrics instead .",
    "we thus address here the issue of whether it is possible , at least in principle ( i.e.  theoretically ) to obtain a very energetic and perfectly collimated jet in a kerr black hole spacetime without making use of magnetic fields .",
    "other authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) have made related studies to which we refer below .",
    "most such authors agree that the strong gravitational field generated by rotating bhs is essential to understanding the origin of jets , or more precisely that the jet originates from a penrose - like process @xcite in the ergosphere of the bh ; collimation may also arise from the gravitational field and that is the main topic in this paper .",
    "our work can therefore be considered as covering the whole class of models in which particles coming from the ergosphere form a jet collimated by the geometry .",
    "although a complete model of an individual jet would require use of detailed models of particle interactions inside the ergosphere , such as that given by @xcite , we show that thin and very long and energetic jets , with some generic features , can be produced in this way .",
    "in particular the presence of a characteristic radius , of the size of the ergosphere , around which one would find the most energetic particles , might be observationally testable .    from a strictly general relativistic point of view , test particles in vacuum ( here , a kerr spacetime ) follow geodesics ; this applies to both charged and uncharged particles , although , of course , in an electrovacuum spacetime , such as kerr - newman , charged particles would follow accelerated trajectories , not geodesics .",
    "thus , in kerr fields , what produces an eventual collimation for test particles , or not , is the form of the resulting geodesics .",
    "hence we discuss here the possibilities of forming an outgoing jet of collimated geodesics followed by particles arising from a penrose - like process inside the ergosphere of a kerr bh .",
    "we show that it is possible in principle to obtain such a jet from a purely gravitational model , but it would require the `` penrose process '' to produce a suitable , and rather special , distribution of outgoing particles .",
    "the model is based on the following considerations .",
    "most studies of geodesics , e.g.  @xcite , employ generalized spherical , i.e.  boyer - lindquist , coordinates .",
    "we transform to weyl coordinates , which are generalized cylindrical coordinates , and are more appropriate , as we shall see , for interpreting the collimated jets .",
    "we consider test particles moving in the axisymmetric stationary gravitational field produced by the kerr spacetime , whose geodesic equations , as projected into a meridional plane , are known @xcite .",
    "our study is restricted to massive test particles , moving on timelike geodesics , but of course massless test particles on null geodesics could be the subject of a similar study .",
    "( incidentally the compendium of @xcite shows that analytic studies of general timelike geodesics have been much less frequent than detailed studies of more restricted problems . )    for particles outgoing from the ergosphere of the kerr bh we examine their asymptotic behaviour . among the geodesic particles incoming to the ergosphere",
    ", we discuss only the ones coming from infinity parallel to the equatorial plane , because these are in practice the particles stemming from the accretion disk .",
    "we show that only those with a small impact parameter are of high enough energy to provide energetic outgoing particles .    in the ergosphere",
    ", a penrose - like process can occur . in the original penrose process",
    ", an incoming particle decays into two parts inside the ergosphere .",
    "it could also decay into more than two parts , or undergo a collision with another particle in this region , or give rise to pair creation @xmath9 from incident photons which would follow null geodesics .",
    "the different possible cases do not affect our considerations , and that is why we do not study them here , although the distribution function of outgoing particles would be required in a more detailed model of the type discussed , in particular to explain why only particles with low angular momentum and not diverging from the rotation axis are produced . for detailed studies see @xcite .",
    "after a decay , one ( or more ) of the particles produced crosses the event horizon and irreversibly plunges into the bh , while a second particle arising from the decay can be ejected out of the ergosphere following a geodesic towards infinity .",
    "this outgoing particle could be ejected so that asymptotically it runs parallel to the axis of symmetry , but we do not discuss only such particles .    in our model there is no appeal to electromagnetic forces to explain the ejection or the collimation of jets , though the particles therein may themselves be charged .",
    "the gravitational field suffices , in the case of strong fields in general relativity , which is the case near the kerr bh , provided the ergosphere produces particles of appropriate energy and initial velocity .",
    "the gravitomagnetic part of the gravitational field then provides the collimation .",
    "hence , our model is , in this respect , simpler than the standard model of @xcite , and is in accordance with the analysis given in @xcite .",
    "the paper starts with a study of kerr geodesics in weyl coordinates in section [ kerrgeod ] ; the next section studies the asymptotic behaviour of geodesics of outgoing particles with @xmath10 ; section [ incoming ] analyses incoming particles stemming from the accretion ; a sample penrose process and the plotting of geodesics are presented in section [ penrose ] ; and finally we discuss in section [ jets ] the significance of our results for jets . in the conclusion ,",
    "we succinctly summarize our main results and evoke some perspectives .",
    "we start from the projection in a meridional plane @xmath11 constant of the kerr geodesics in boyer - lindquist spherical coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the metric is @xmath15 where @xmath6 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the mass and the angular momentum of the source , and we have taken units such that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is newton s constant of gravitation . the ` radial ' coordinate in ( [ kerr ] ) has been named @xmath12 because it is more convenient for us to use the rescaled coordinate @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath249 , for the incoming particles , does not play a role like that of @xmath250 for the outgoing particles ( compare ( 30 ) to ( [ 29 ] ) ) .",
    "to make a jet using the geodesics discussed above , we would have to assume that incoming particles arrive in the ergosphere and undergo a penrose process .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in its original version @xcite , each particle may be decomposed into two subparticles and one of them may cross the horizon and fall irreversibly into the bh , while the other is ejected to the exterior of the ergosphere ; or the incoming particle may collide with another particle resulting in one plunging into the bh and the other being ejected to the exterior . the second case can correspond to a creation of particles , say @xmath251 and @xmath252 from an incoming photon ( @xmath253 ) interacting with another inside the ergosphere .",
    "we do not present here all the possible cases , which are exhaustively studied , especially for agn , in @xcite .",
    "there is also observational evidence for a close correlation between the disappearance of the unstable inner accretion disk and some subsequent ejections from microquasars such as grs 1915 + 1105 mirrod94,mirrod99 , which from our point of view could correspond to the instability causing disk material to fall through the ergosphere and to then give rise to a burst of ejecta from penrose - like processes .",
    "here we are mainly interested in the outgoing particles which follow geodesics that tend asymptotically towards a parallel to the @xmath28 axis , as described in the earlier section [ l0geods ] .",
    "these events are closely dependent on the possibilities allowed by the conservation equations . in the case",
    "when the incoming particle splits into two @xcite , the conservation equations of the energy and angular momentum are @xmath254 we know from ( [ 21 ] ) that for the outgoing particles we study @xmath255 .",
    "the particles falling irreversibly into the bh have energy @xmath256 and angular momentum @xmath257 .",
    "the energy and the angular momentum of a particle in the ergoregion can be negative which is the basis of the penrose process .",
    "the particle falling into the black hole has negative energy , and hence the outgoing particle , leaving the ergosphere , has a bigger energy than the incoming particle , @xmath258    we have plotted numerically the geodesics for incoming , outgoing and falling particles with the following values for the parameters : @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "these values are chosen in such a way that the geodesics meet inside the ergoregion situated in the interior of the ergosphere @xmath265 \\right\\ } \\left [ 1-\\left ( \\frac{\\rho } { \\rho _ { e}}\\right ) \\right ] , \\ ] ] and they produce for the asymptotes of the outgoing particles @xmath266 and for the incoming @xmath267 .",
    "the curves are built with the initial conditions @xmath268=20 $ ] for outgoing particles and @xmath269=0.60 $ ] for incoming particles .",
    "their intersection is situated at the point @xmath270 and @xmath271 inside the ergosphere which we can take as the initial condition for the falling particle and from where we trace the three curves ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    , from @xmath272 , to the turning point ( @xmath273 , @xmath274 ) located inside the ergosphere , whose boundary is indicated , where it decays into an infalling particle and an outgoing particle ( bold line ) following a geodesic asymptotic to @xmath275 when @xmath276 .",
    "the parameters of the black hole are @xmath277 and @xmath141 .",
    "the parameters of the three geodesics are @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath278 , @xmath279,width=302 ]    the exhibition of these numerical solutions with an outgoing geodesic which leaves the ergosphere after the penrose process and has vertical asymptote with the value @xmath132 precisely equal to ( [ 30 ] ) confirms that a model based on such geodesics is possible .",
    "we have shown that to obtain a jet of particles close to the rotation axis , it must be formed from particles with ( almost ) zero angular momentum , @xmath10 .",
    "if we consider only particles with @xmath10 , there is among them a subset which give a perfectly collimated jet , i.e.  a set of geodesics exactly parallel to the axis : for each allowed value of @xmath8 they form a ring of radius @xmath280 ^{1/2},\\ ] ] whwre @xmath281 .",
    "note that @xmath282 is the circumference of the ergosphere in the equatorial plane . for large @xmath7 the set of all these geodesics will give a jet of radius of the order of @xmath250 , with a density of particles dependent on the distribution in @xmath8 for given @xmath7 , which remains perfectly collimated all the way to infinity .",
    "we note that all other geodesics with @xmath10 will spread out from the axis along lines @xmath283 .",
    "an astrophysical jet will of course be of only finite extent and not perfectly collimated , so it could include such geodesics for suitably large @xmath284 , as well as geodesics with a small @xmath82 .    thus forming a collimated jet of particles from a penrose - like process , this jet having a narrow opening angle , for a rotating black hole without an electromagnetic field , depends on the initial distribution of particles leaving the ergosphere , or of some non - gravitational collimating force , even if we consider only particles with @xmath10 .    on the other hand , outgoing particles with small energies , namely of the order of their rest energy ,",
    "@xmath285 , and @xmath286 have asymptotes parallel to the @xmath28 axis with @xmath287 .",
    "this predicted scale of the region of confined highly energetic particles might provide a test if the accretion disk parameters provided values for the bh mass and angular momentum , in a manner such as discussed in mccshanar06 and papers cited therein , and if the transverse linear scale of the jet near the bh could be measured .",
    "( particles of equally high energy may exist in @xmath288 but will spread out away from the axis . )    let us make a brief qualitative remark about the observability of the two species , ( a ) and ( b ) , of geodesics outgoing from the ergosphere , studied in section 3 ( after ( 45 ) ) . as illustrated by the figure 2 , for each fixed value of @xmath2  there is one ( b)-geodesic only , which is the limit of many ( one infinity of ) ( a)-geodesics when the turning point tends to the infinity ( @xmath289 , @xmath192 ) . however , the ( a)-type geodesics , though much more numerous than the ( b)-type geodesics , are , directly or indirectly ( i.e. by radiation , if charged ) , much more difficult to observe .",
    "indeed , contrary to the set of ( b)-particles framing the jet in one direction ( collimation along the poles ) , the ( a)-particles ejected from the ergosphere along unbound geodesics at lower latitudes are dispersed into the whole 3d - space ( @xmath290 steradians ) .",
    "the ( a)-particles never produce a beam into one privileged direction but instead dilute in the whole space . observed from the infinity in one line of sight ( @xmath291 constant , @xmath292constant ) , one single ( a)-particle could directly be detected.while , from the infinity in the line of sight @xmath28  ( @xmath47 , @xmath293 ) , the observer will see one infinity ( each point of the perimeter of the circle of radius @xmath2 ) of ( b)-particles .",
    "the result is reinforced when we extend it to all the possible values of @xmath2 . encircling the foot of the ( b)-jet , the ( a)-particles frame a gerb , from the basis of which a possible indirect effect of isotropic radiation emission ( from accelerated charged particles )",
    "could be observed , during the jet eruption .",
    "besides , by their dispersion , the pressure the ( a)-particles locally exert on the ambient medium is much weaker than the pressure exerted by the numerous coherent ( b)-particles of the jet ( a narrow parallel beam is more incisive ) . the ( a)-particles are probably more rapidly thermalised than the ( b)-particles of the jet .",
    "so , one might expect that many particles ejected at lower latitudes never attain infinity ( neither the height of the jet ) , and most of them feed the medium , framing a halo around the bh , falling inside again , or returning to the accretion disk .",
    "we noted also that geodesics with @xmath68 can be asymptotic to lines with constant @xmath13 .",
    "these asymptotes allow us to define another type of jet which is bigger and less collimated than the previous one .",
    "it is interesting to remark that recent observations @xcite suggest the existence of two different types of jets precisely of these sorts , i.e.  narrowly and broadly collimated .",
    "there exists an ensemble of geodesics that tend asymptotically to these conical characteristics .",
    "the unbounded geodesics have mainly been discussed , however , by using boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath13 by the majority of authors .",
    "if we rewrite our results , using these coordinates , we may interpret our results and compare to those of other authors .",
    "however , as we show below , these coordinates are not as well - suited to the issues we have discussed .    geodesics with @xmath294 may reach low values of @xmath80 , if @xmath295 is large enough , but must be bounded away from @xmath296 ( i.e.  @xmath47 or @xmath297 ) , since those values would imply @xmath298 , from ( [ 2 ] ) , cf .",
    "@xcite , p.  348 . in practice",
    "this means that a narrow jet along the axis must be composed of particles with very small @xmath299 .",
    "particles with non - zero @xmath23 could only lie within a jet with bounded @xmath61 for a limited distance , because large enough @xmath28 would imply @xmath300 .",
    "if @xmath301 , the orbits reverse the sign of @xmath302 and reach the equatorial plane , and would thus be expected to be absorbed by the accretion disk .",
    "for @xmath303 they are confined to a band of values of @xmath13 given by the roots of @xmath304 .",
    "these are the ` vortical ' trajectories of de felice et al .",
    "decal72,decur92,decar97 . depending on the maximum opening angle @xmath13 , these may still hit , and",
    "presumably be absorbed by , a thick accretion disk @xcite .",
    "such orbits can be adequately populated by penrose - like processes @xcite , and might undergo processes which reduce the opening angle @xcite .",
    "a jet composed of such particles would tend to be hollow and would have a larger radius @xmath61 at large @xmath28 than is obtained for orbits with @xmath10 , and hence be observationally distinguishable .",
    "the presence of these escaping trajectories spiralling round the polar axis can be associated with the gravitomagnetic effects due to the rotation of the hole , one of whose consequences is that even curves with @xmath10 have a non - zero @xmath305 at finite distances .",
    "thus although an infinitely extended jet of bounded @xmath49 radius would only contain particles with @xmath81 , which we would expect to be a set of measure zero among all particles ejected , we shall consider this as a good model even for real jets . in practice ,",
    "interactions with other forces and objects , which would affect the jet both by gravitational and other forces , have to be taken into account once the jet is well away from the bh , and these influences might or might not improve the collimation . in decar97 ,",
    "the authors discussed possible improved collimation for particles of low @xmath299 using forces which have a timescale long compared with the dynamical timescale of the geodesics , and which act to move particles to new geodesics with changed parameters .",
    "it should be noted that if the object producing the jet is modelled as a rotating black hole , production of a collimated jet only arises naturally if the object throws out energetic particles with low @xmath299 , since our discussion shows that other particles can not join such a jet unless there is some other strong collimating influence away from the bh .",
    "however previous authors have not pointed out the existence of asymptotes @xmath306 , presumably because they are less obvious when using coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , considering @xmath307 , the expressions ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) produce @xmath308 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 . with these expansions",
    "it is clear that in the limit @xmath47 one would have to take the limit of @xmath311 to allow @xmath132 to be determined .    in the same vein , to find the values of asymptotes @xmath312 near the equatorial plane @xmath87 for the incoming particles ( see ( [ 29 ] ) ) one has to study @xmath313 if one uses the coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , one finds for the asymptotic expansion @xmath314 the following expressions , @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath317/2\\rho}+o(\\rho^{-3})$ ] .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "there are projections of geodesics all over the meridional planes . among these geodesics",
    "there are some , with vertical asymptotes parallel to @xmath28 which can form a perfectly collimated jet .",
    "there are , as well , geodesics with horizontal asymptotes parallel to the radial coordinate @xmath61 , that can represent the paths of incoming particles leaving the accretion disk .",
    "these two types of geodesics have intersection points that can be situated inside the ergosphere . at these points",
    "a penrose process can take place , producing the ejection of particles along the axis with bigger energies than the energies of incoming particles close to the equatorial plane .",
    "the energies of outgoing particles are significantly larger than the ones of the incident particles for the asymptotically vertical geodesics near the scale @xmath318 of the ergosphere diameter in the coordinate @xmath49 , so such particles can show collimation around the surface of a tube of diameter @xmath319 centred on the axis of symmetry .",
    "such collimated outgoing particles have to have a zero orbital momentum @xmath81 , which implies , from the penrose process , that the incoming particles have a negative orbital momentum , @xmath320 .",
    "thus the jet has to be fed from incoming particles with retrograde orbits in the accretion disk .",
    "there is evidence for the existence of substantial counterrotating parts of accretion disks koimeishi00,tharydjor97 , and such counterrotations could explain the viscosity inducing the instabilities which trigger the falling of matter towards the ergosphere .",
    "it is now known @xcite that there is a close connection between instabilities in the accretion disk and the genesis of jets for quasars and microquasars .",
    "the most energetic incoming particles are those near the equatorial plane . hence the incoming particles which produce the most energetic outgoing particles by a penrose process in the ergosphere , whose maximum size is @xmath248 , are those with angular momentum @xmath321 and a very small impact parameter @xmath247 .    also , the limiting diameter of the core of a perfectly collimated jet depends upon the size of the ergosphere .",
    "the effective thickness of this part of the jet in this case is of the order of @xmath322 .",
    "our idealised model is based on the well - behaved vacuum stationary exact solution of einstein s equations with axial symmetry , namely the kerr metrics , which does not take into account the ambient medium .",
    "though this medium is very dilute , it plays a non - negligible role on the more complex global scenario for jets like progressive widening of the beam , advent of knots , lobes , etc ... however , for the scenario that we are here concerned , namely the beginning of the jet ( parsec scale for microquasars , while some hundred parsecs for agn , depending on the bh mass ) , where it is strongly collimated , our approximation of test - particles along geodesics is relevant .",
    "indeed , the observed jets stemming from active galactic nuclei ejected along the polar axis have ultrarelativistic speeds , typically @xmath323c . the ejected particles , forming the jets , are thermalized with temperatures of the order @xmath324k ( @xcite ) producing a lateral force from the pressure gradient between the thermal energy of the particles in the outflow and the low density enveloping medium ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the internal particle trajectories to these jets expand laterally at the speed of sound , being of the order @xmath325km / s @xcite , asymptotically forming a conical shape with an opening angle of the order of the inverse mach number @xmath326 radians . as we can see ( @xcite , appendix ) , the more realistic trajectories corresponding to such corrective terms represent only a small perturbation to the geodesics .",
    "the model that we present to explain the formation and collimation of jets arises essentially from relativistic strong gravitational field phenomena without resort to electromagnetic phenomena . from this point of view",
    "the model could be interesting also for understanding observational evidence of neutral particles emitted from the inner jet itself .",
    "for example , the recent observations of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( difficult to explain , implying neutral particles such as neutrinos , or h or fe atoms , etc . aug07,aug07a , derrazfin08 , and @xcite and references therein ) is a new challenge . to explain the very high energy of such neutral ( massive ) particles , especially neutrinos @xcite ( which are able to travel freely over large distances ) , our model very naturally suggests that they could be directly coming from the collimated inner jet , which would privilege sources ( bh ) with rotational @xmath28-axis along the line of sight of the observation .",
    "massless particles ( photons ) would be emitted by charged particles accelerated along the collimated inner jet @xcite , which would privilege sources ( bh ) with rotational @xmath28-axis perpendicular to the line of sight of the observation .",
    "our model is sufficiently general to fit various types of observed jets , like grb , jets ejected from agn or from microquasars , whenever they are energetic enough to be explained by just a rotating black hole fed by an accretion disk in an axisymmetric configuration .",
    "the main drawback is the need to preferentially populate the geodesics which can form such collimated jets .",
    "work is in progress on this question to determine a possible confrontation of the model with observations",
    ".  our preliminary studies led us to understand the fundamental role of the function @xmath327 of the geodesics equations ( see ( 2 ) and ( 19 ) ) .",
    "as an example , in the special case where the equation @xmath328 has a real double root , there exist only two narrow ranges of @xmath2 values for large values of @xmath7 . in this case",
    ", we can evaluate from the power , for example of radio loud extragalactic jets ( @xcite ) , or of microquasars jets ( @xcite ) , the particle density , the mean kinetic energy by particle , the mean velocity and the lorentz factor of the jets .",
    "these results , since they require a long presentation , deserve a separate paper which is under preparation .",
    "the existence of vacuum solutions of the einstein equations of kerr type but with a richer , not connected , topological configuration of the ergosphere ( see @xcite , figs .  7 to 10 ) , allows us to propose the existence of double jets , because they are expected to come out from the ergosphere .",
    "these bipolar jets have been observed ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite fig .  1 , @xcite fig .  2 , and @xcite ) and",
    "could be naturally interpreted in a generalization of our model .",
