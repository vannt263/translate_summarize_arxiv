    "the coarse moduli space @xmath1 is a projective variety whose points correspond to isomorphism classes of deligne - mumford stable @xmath2-pointed curves of genus @xmath3 .",
    "our collective intuition for what moduli spaces should look like is based on the spaces @xmath1 , and these varieties have been studied from many perspectives .",
    "one of the most important problems is to describe all morphisms admitted by @xmath1 .",
    "maps to projective varieties are given by the section rings of divisors .",
    "a divisor @xmath4 is _ semiample _ if some multiple of @xmath4 is base point free ; the map associated to a semiample divisor is therefore a morphism .",
    "semiample divisors lie in the nef cone , the set of divisors that nonnegatively intersect all curves on the variety .    for the special case",
    "when @xmath5 , @xmath0 is conjectured by hu and keel to be a `` mori dream space , '' which would imply that every nef divisor on @xmath0 is semiample and that the cone of nef divisors is finitely generated @xcite .",
    "the major support for the conjecture comes from our understanding of the space for @xmath6 .",
    "for example , we know that @xmath7 is a mori dream space from two perspectives : castravet gives an explicit constructive proof in @xcite , and the sweeping theory of @xcite shows that log fano varieties are mori dream spaces .",
    "unfortunately since @xmath0 is not log fano for @xmath8 , one can not directly apply the results of @xcite , and extending castravet s approach to larger values of @xmath2 seems daunting .",
    "attempts to prove that the conjectural descriptions of the nef and effective cones are correct seem mired down in the fiercely combinatorial nature of these moduli spaces .",
    "very recently fakhruddin , in @xcite , showed that there is a potentially infinite supply of semiample divisors on @xmath0 that arise as first chern classes of vector bundles which come from the theory of conformal blocks .",
    "first defined by tsuchiya , ueno , and yamada , these bundles are specified by a simple lie algebra @xmath9 , a positive integer @xmath10 called the _ level _ , and an appropriately chosen @xmath2-tuple of dominant weights @xmath11 .",
    "the ranks of these vector bundles are computed by the famous verlinde formula .",
    "fakhruddin has given recursive formulas for the classes of these divisors and for their intersection with certain combinatorially defined curves in called @xmath12-curves . in this work",
    "we study some of the simplest examples of these divisors , determine where they lie in the cone of nef divisors , and describe the morphisms associated to them .",
    "we consider a family of divisors on @xmath0 determined by the lie algebra @xmath13 . in this case , the weights @xmath11 can be identified with an @xmath2-tuple of nonnegative integers less than or equal to the level @xmath10 .",
    "we take all the weights to be equal to one , and examine the family one obtains by varying @xmath10 . as we now explain , this gives a collection of numerical equivalence classes of semiample divisors @xmath14 on @xmath0 with @xmath15 even .",
    "indeed , if @xmath2 is odd , then by lemma [ oddsumlemma ] below , one has that @xmath16 is trivial .",
    "also , fakhruddin has shown that if @xmath17 , then @xmath18 is trivial .",
    "in particular , if @xmath19 then the divisor @xmath16 is trivial .    one can work with these divisors as completely combinatorial objects .",
    "we give a formula for intersecting these divisors with a basis of @xmath20-cycles on the space and give a closed form expression for their classes ( theorem [ intersect ] , propositions [ reducedformula ] and [ rlclosedform ] ) . using this information , we study the position of these divisors in the nef cone and study the morphisms they define .",
    "although these divisors arise from a simple choice of weights , they have many interesting geometric properties .",
    "the symmetric group @xmath21 acts on @xmath0 by permuting the marked points and the divisors @xmath22 are @xmath21 invariant . in particular , by @xcite ( and @xcite ) , each of these divisors is big , and hence the morphism it defines is birational .",
    "divisors that give embeddings lie on the interior of the nef cone . as we show",
    ", each member @xmath22 of our family lies on the boundary of @xmath23 , and defines a birational contraction of @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , four of the divisors generate extremal rays of the symmetric nef cone ( theorem [ extremal ] ) .",
    "these divisors define geometrically meaningful maps . for example :    * @xmath25 defines a morphism from @xmath0 to the satake compactification of the moduli space of abelian varieties of dimension @xmath3 ( theorem [ satake ] ) .",
    "* @xmath26 defines the morphism from @xmath0 to a natural ( generalized ) flip of the git quotient @xmath27 ( theorem [ dg-1morphism ] ) . *",
    "@xmath28 defines the morphism from @xmath0 to the git quotient @xmath27 ( theorem [ git ] ) .",
    "in addition , we recall that fakhruddin shows that the morphism given by any @xmath22 for @xmath29 factors through hassett s reduction morphisms ( @xcite ) @xmath30 for @xmath31 @xcite*prop . 4.7 .    using each of the four divisors @xmath22 , @xmath32",
    ", we obtain a family of nef divisors on @xmath33 , the moduli space of stable curves of genus @xmath34 ; we give these classes explicitly in proposition [ flagpullback ] .",
    "the ray theorem of keel and mckernan @xcite*thm .",
    "1.2 and its extension by farkas and gibney @xcite*thm .",
    "4 enable one to give a combinatorial proof that divisors in what we call the log canonical part of the cone are nef . if a divisor @xmath4 is of this form , and if @xmath4 intersects every @xmath35-curve nonnegatively , then @xmath4 is nef .",
    "as we show in proposition [ nlc ] , there are divisors in our family that do not lie in this part of the cone . in particular , we know no combinatorial proof that they are semiample .",
    "there are two other families of conformal blocks divisors that have been studied extensively . in @xcite",
    ", fakhruddin considers the set of divisors given by @xmath36 , level @xmath37 and varying weights @xmath11 .",
