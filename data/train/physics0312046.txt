    "<S> a hybrid mesoscopic multi - particle collision model is used to study diffusion - influenced reaction kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> the mesoscopic particle dynamics conserves mass , momentum and energy so that hydrodynamic effects are fully taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> reactive and non - reactive interactions with catalytic solute particles are described by full molecular dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> results are presented for large - scale , three - dimensional simulations to study the influence of diffusion on the rate constants of the @xmath0 reaction . in the limit of a dilute solution of catalytic c particles , </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results are compared with diffusion equation approaches for both the irreversible and reversible reaction cases . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results for systems where the volume fraction @xmath1 of catalytic spheres is high are also presented , and collective interactions among reactions on catalytic spheres that introduce volume fraction dependence in the rate constants are studied . </S>"
