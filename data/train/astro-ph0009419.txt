    "irregular galaxies are metal poor systems whose oxygen deficiency can be explained by an imf with a larger fraction of low - mass stars relative to the solar vicinity imf , but similar to that found in globular clusters ( carigi , coln , & peimbert 1999 , ccp ; carigi & peimbert 2001 , cp ) . in both papers ,",
    "the chemical evolution of three irregular galaxies and an average galaxy called  typical irregular galaxy \" are discussed by models for three ages : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 yr and different factors @xmath7 that indicate the relative excess of sub - stellar objects ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the lack of abundance determinations for other elements besides o , or an estimation of gas mass fraction , prevented the authors to discriminate which of these models ( @xmath7 , age ) is most appropriate .",
    "this work explores whether existing photometric data for these galaxies and predictions from population synthesis models ( carigi & bruzual 2000 ) can indicate the chemical history of these irregular galaxies , under the ccp and cp chemical evolution models .",
    "carigi & bruzual ( 2000 ) adopt imf ( or factor @xmath7 ) and @xmath9 from closed - box models with continuous or bursting star formation rates .",
    "( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath11 ) colors evolved according to different spectral evolution models and color data suggest that both , * ngc 1560 * and * ngc 2366 * have been forming stars for the last 10 gyr .",
    "the case * i zw 18 * is different , its observed colors are consistent with an age between @xmath4 and @xmath5 yr , certainly lower than for ngc 1560 and ngc 2366 .    for the * typical irregular galaxy *",
    "the @xmath3 color is bluer for a given @xmath2 than expected from continuous star formation models .",
    "this may also indicate that star formation in these systems occurs in bursts .",
    "after each burst of star formation , a galaxy becomes bluer ( especially in @xmath3 ) due to the increase in the number of massive main sequence .",
    "ccp models with bursting sfr can explain the bluest galaxies in the sample , as well as the o abundance of this system .",
    "we compares observed colors of several * local group dwarf irregular galaxies * , with models for ngc 1560 , the best known galaxy in our sample .",
    "again , observed colors are consistent with the predictions from chemical evolution models @xmath5 and @xmath6 yr old , although some galaxies show @xmath2 colors redder than expected .",
    "in this work we have explored the color behavior of stellar populations that evolve according to chemical evolution models .",
    "our main conclusions are :    @xmath12 at a given age , the color predicted for a typical irregular galaxy is independent of the fraction of sub - stellar objects .",
    "therefore , color data helps to discriminate model age but not @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath12 based on available photometric data , models with fast chemical enrichment ( age less than @xmath5 yr ) are discarded for most irregular galaxies .",
    "these populations are too young to reach the observed colors .",
    "the exception is i zw 18 , whose favored age is between @xmath4 and @xmath5 yr .",
    "@xmath12 although the age of the dominant stellar population in these galaxies is unknown , photometric models can be used to arrange these systems on an age sequence based on observed colors .",
    "we have found a tendency of unknown origin for the @xmath2 color to be matched by stellar populations of higher @xmath13 than the @xmath3 color , at constant age .",
    "equivalently , @xmath3 implies younger ages , at a given metallicity , than @xmath2 ."
