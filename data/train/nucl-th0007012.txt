    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) describes the nucleon as a composite system with many internal degrees of freedom . in the nonperturbative region , which encompasses hadron structure and intermediate range observables ,",
    "the large @xmath3 limit of the theory , which partly allows treatment in closed form , has proven to be of phenomenological utility .",
    "this limit of qcd may be realized either in terms of the constituent quark model , or , as was first suggested , in the form of effective meson field theory , in which the baryons appear as topologically stable soliton solutions @xcite .",

    "observables the results fell short by typically @xmath4 30 @xmath5 , which could be viewed as an expected flaw of the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "that approach to the model did however have the more principal imperfection in that its lack of stable semiclassical solutions with good quantum numbers .",
    "the quantization was therefore realised by means of rigid body rotation of the classical skyrmion solutions .",
    "a strictly canonical quantization of skyrme model was derived later in ref.@xcite and shown to yield stable quantized skyrmion solutions in refs.@xcite .",
    "in addition the skyrme model was generalized to representations of arbitrary dimension of the su(2 ) group .",
    "it was shown that - in fact an obvious consistency check - the classical skyrmion solutions are independent of the dimension of the representation , but that in contrast the canonically quantized skyrme model gives results for baryon observables , which are representation dependent .    an interesting consequence of the canonical _ ab initio _ quantization of the skyrme model is the natural appearance of a finite effective pion mass even for the chirally symmetric lagrangian . while the finite pion mass is conventionally introduced by adding an explicitly chiral symmetry breaking pion mass term to the lagrangian density of the model @xcite , the canonical quantization procedure by itself gives rise to a finite pion mass .",
    "this realizes skyrme s original conjecture that `` this ( chiral ) symmetry is , however , destroyed by the boundary condition ( @xmath6 ) , and we believe that the mass ( of pion ) may arise as a self consistent quantal effect @xcite '' .    to derive the explicit expressions for electric , magnetic , axial and pseudoscalar form factors of the nucleon we employ the expressions for the noether currents derived in ref.@xcite . because of the appearance of a finite `` effective '' pion mass the asymptotic behavior of the chiral angle @xmath7 has the required exponential falloff , which ensures finite radii and physical forms for the energy ( mass ) density .",
