    "a correct treatment of the charm hadroproduction is important to the atmospheric muon and neutrino studies since short - lived charmed particles , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , produced in collisions of cosmic rays with nuclei of the air , become the dominant source of atmospheric muons and neutrinos at energies @xmath6 tev .",
    "thus , one needs to take them into consideration as the background for extraterrestrial neutrinos @xcite .",
    "muons originating from decay of these charmed hadrons are so called prompt muons ( pm ) that contribute to the total atmospheric muon flux .",
    "another aspect of the interest to the charm production relates to the gluon density at small gluon momentum fraction @xmath0 .",
    "the gluon density at small @xmath0 is of considerable importance because this influences strongly the charm production cross section , both total and inclusive . recently",
    "@xcite and @xcite have analyzed the influence of small-@xmath0 behavior of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) to the atmospheric lepton fluxes at the sea level .",
    "basing on next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations of the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , they predict pm fluxes at the sea level depending strongly on proton gluon distributions at small @xmath0 scale , @xmath7 .    the muon spectra underwater computed with the model of @xcite , in which used were the mrsd@xmath8 @xcite and the cteq3 m @xcite sets of pdfs ,",

    "talk , using predictions of more recent pqcd model @xcite of the charm production , we discuss the pm contribution to muons underwater at depths typical for operating and constructing neutrino telescopes @xcite .",
    "namely , we try to study a pm flux underwater dependence on the slope @xmath9 of the gluon pdf at small @xmath0 : @xmath10 .",
    "the nature of the small-@xmath0 behavior of the gluon density is now under extensive discussion ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the small-@xmath0 behavior of the pdfs is the subject of the deep interest since the realization of the underlying dynamics is yet far from being complete .",
    "due to dominant subprocess in heavy quarks hadroproduction , @xmath11 , the charm production is sensitive to the gluon density at small @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the gluon momentum fraction .",
    "one may evaluate the scale of @xmath0 in cosmic ray interactions as follows .",
    "the product of the gluon momentum fraction @xmath12 of the projectile nucleon and that of the target @xmath0 near the charm production threshold ( @xmath13 ) is , where @xmath14 is the primary nucleon energy in the lab frame . since a muon takes away about 5% of the primary nucleon energy , @xmath15 , we have because of the steepness of the primary cosmic ray spectrum only large @xmath12 contribute sizeably to the atmospheric charm production , one needs adopt @xmath16 .",
