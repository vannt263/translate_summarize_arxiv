    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have been extensively studied at optical wavelengths ( see , e.g. , lauer & postman 1992 ; postman & lauer 1995 and references therein ) . the small scatter in their absolute magnitudes and their high luminosities make them useful standard candles for classical cosmological tests involving the hubble diagram , such as the determination of @xmath9 and the variation of @xmath10 with redshift . however , there is now firm evidence that significant evolution has taken place in the colours and optical luminosities of cluster early - type galaxies ( including the bcgs ) since @xmath7 .",
    "thus the hubble diagram could be seriously affected by evolutionary changes .",
    "the study of the bcgs in the near - infrared @xmath0-band ( @xmath11 ) has two main advantages over optical studies : first , the @xmath12-corrections are appreciably smaller ( indeed , they are negative ) and virtually independent of the spectral type of the galaxies ; and second , the light at long wavelengths is dominated by long - lived stars ( see , e.g. , aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "thus the @xmath0-band luminosity is a good measure of the total stellar mass in the galaxies . in this paper",
    "we present new results on the @xmath0-band hubble diagram for the bcgs and compare them with the predictions of semianalytic models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a full account of these results is given in aragn - salamanca , baugh & kauffmann ( 1997 ) .",
    "we analyse a sample bcgs in optically - selected clusters ( @xmath1 ) which should represent the richest clusters present at each redshift .",
    "the @xmath0-band data come from aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , barger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and barger ( 1997 ) .",
    "morphological information is available from ground - based and hst images for many of the clusters . in general , the bcgs are either cd galaxies or giant ellipticals .",
    "photometry for the bcgs was obtained inside a fixed metric aperture of 50@xmath13kpc diameter ( @xmath14km@xmath13s@xmath15mpc@xmath16 assumed throughout ) .",
    "galactic reddening corrections , seeing corrections and @xmath12-corrections were applied as in aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "-0.7 cm    0.8 cm    figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath0 magnitude ",
    "redshift relation ( hubble diagram ) for the bcgs in our sample .",
    "the scatter of the observed magnitudes around the no - evolution prediction is @xmath17mag . assuming that the @xmath0-band light provides an estimate of the total stellar mass of the galaxies",
    ", this implies that bcgs at a given redshift have very similar masses in stars ( within 30% _ r.m.s . _ ) .",
    "moreover , the luminosity of the bcgs does not evolve strongly with redshift .",
    "this is shown more clearly on the top panel of figure  [ fig2 ] , where the no - evolution prediction has been subtracted from the data . for @xmath4",
    "the observed magnitudes do not seem to evolve with redshift .",
    "for @xmath5 there is a hint of _ negative _ evolution : bcgs at high redshift tend to be marginally fainter than low redshift ones . if we parameterise the luminosity evolution as @xmath18 , we get @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively . thus the bcgs show _ no _ or marginally _ negative _ luminosity evolution .",
    "however the colours of these galaxies show the same evolution as the early - type cluster galaxies : they get progressively bluer with redshift at a rate which indicates that their stellar populations were formed at @xmath23 and evolved passively thereafter .",
    "if the total stellar mass of the galaxies has remained constant , we would expect them to get progressively _",
    "brighter _ with redshift , as the average ages of their stellar populations get younger . since that brightening is not observed , the most likely explanation is that the total mass in stars in the bcgs has grown with time",
    ". we will now estimate the rate of this growth .    using evolutionary population synthesis models ( bruzual & charlot 1997 ) with a standard imf we predict the expected luminosity evolution of a passively - evolving stellar population formed at a given redshift .",
    "that should represent the brightening of the stellar populations due to the decrease in average stellar age with redshift .",
    "the model predictions are plotted on figure  [ fig1 ] ( le lines ) for formation redshifts @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these models produce a colour evolution compatible with the observations of early - type cluster galaxies . in figure  [ fig2 ] ( lower two panels ) we have plotted the observed magnitudes after subtracting the luminosity evolution predictions . since the models assume a constant stellar mass , the rate of change with redshift in the @xmath0 magnitudes , after correcting for the expected brightening due to passive evolution , should be a direct measurement of the rate of change in stellar mass . parameterising the evolution as @xmath26",
    ", we obtain the values of @xmath27 shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , which imply that the mass in stars of a typical bcg grew by a factor @xmath28 if @xmath21 or @xmath8 if @xmath29 from @xmath7 to @xmath30 .",
    "the recent development of _ semi - analytic techniques _ has provided theorists with the tools to make predictions for the formation and evolution of galaxies , using physically motivated models set in the context of hierarchical structure formation in the universe .",
    "the properties of galaxies in these models are in broad agreement with the present day characteristics of galaxies , such as the distribution of luminosities , colours and morphologies and with the properties of galaxies at high redshift , including the faint galaxy counts , colours and redshift distributions .",
    "full details of the models and these results can be found in kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1994 ) for the munich models and cole et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and baugh et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) for the durham models .",
    "see also the contribution by frenk in this volume . in these models , there are three different ways in which the stellar masses of the brightest galaxies in clusters can grow : ( 1 ) merging of satellite galaxies that sink to the center of the halo through dynamical friction ; ( 2 ) quiescent star formation as a result of gas cooling from the surrounding hot halo medium ; and ( 3 ) `` bursts '' of star formation associated with the merging of a massive satellite .    -0.5",
    "cm    0.8 cm    too blue and too bright if all gas in the central cooling flows of massive clusters turns into stars with a normal imf .",
    "the munich models adopt a somewhat _ ad hoc _ fix by simply switching off star formation in cooling flows once the circular velocity of a halo grows larger than @xmath31km@xmath13s@xmath16 ( this value was chosen so that the models produced a good fit to the bright end of the virgo cluster luminosity function ) .",
    "figure  [ fighist ] shows that star formation from bursts and cooling gas then only account for a few percent of the final mass of the bcg .",
    "the rest comes from accreted galaxies .",
    "in figures  [ fighist ] and  [ figmass ] we illustrate how @xmath32 bcgs are predicted to evolve by the semi - analytic models .",
    "one unresolved problem in these models is that the colours and absolute magnitudes of central cluster galaxies are predicted to@xmath13 be    the observational selection picks out _ the richest clusters _ at each redshift .",
    "we mimic this selection by calculating the masses of bcgs in halos _ of fixed circular velocity _ as a function of redshift .",
    "this means we are selecting rarer objects with increasing redshift . in figure  [ figmass ]",
    "we compare both the durham and the munich models with the observations .",
    "note that different assumptions about the dark halo profiles or the formation of stars in cooling flows make very little difference to the predictions for the _ relative change _ in the masses of bcgs from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "this is because the crucial parameter controlling this change is the _ time since the big bang_. high redshift clusters have less massive bcgs because there has been less time for these galaxies to assemble as a result of merging or gas accretion .",
    "the agreement between the models and the observations in both the rate of growth of the stellar mass and the scatter is remarkable : both models agree well with the data when the appropriate value of @xmath9 is used in the analysis .",
    "it is thus not possible to make statements about a preferred cosmology .",
    "we thank g.  bruzual and s.  charlot for allowing us to use their model results prior to publication , and a. barger for some of the @xmath0-band data .",
    "the current durham semi - analytic models are the result of a collaboration between shaun cole , carlos frenk , cedric lacey and cmb .",
    "this work was carried out under the auspices of eara , a european association for research in astronomy , and the tmr network on galaxy formation and evolution funded by the european commission .",
