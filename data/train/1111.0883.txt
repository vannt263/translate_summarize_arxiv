    "the possible existence of a neutral weakly coupled light spin-@xmath6 gauge @xmath0-boson @xcite , which is originated from supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with an extra @xmath7 symmetry , has recently attracted much attention due to its multifaceted influences in particle physics , nuclear physics , astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0-boson can provide annihilation of light dark matter which can be responsible for the excess flux of @xmath8 kev photons coming from the central region of our galaxy observed by the spi / integral satellite jean03,boe04a , boe04b , boe04c .",
    "it is also proposed that the @xmath0-boson can be mediator of the putative fifth force \" providing a possible mechanism for non - newtonian gravity , i.e. , the violation of the inverse - square - law ( isl ) of newtonian gravitational force at short distance fuj71,ark98,fis99,pea01,hoy03,lon03,ade03,uza03,dec05,rey05,pok06,kap07,nes08,kam08,aza08,new09,ger10,luc10 .",
    "thus far various upper limits on the deviation from the isl have been put forward down to femtometer range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0-boson can involve a rich phenomenology in particle physics and nuclear physics and may have observable effects in particle decays @xcite and nucleon scattering processes @xcite , which can also put limits on the @xmath0-boson properties .",
    "studying properties of the @xmath0-boson is thus important for understanding the relevant new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "very recently , the effects of the @xmath0-boson on the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) and neutron star structure have been investigated kri09,wen09,zha11,wen11 and it is shown that the vector @xmath0-boson can significantly stiffen the nuclear matter eos  and thus enhance drastically the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "in particular , by considering the @xmath0-boson , the stability and observed global properties of neutron stars can be reasonably explained by using the neutron - rich matter eos with a supersoft nuclear symmetry energy at supersaturation densities consistent with the available terrestrial laboratory data on the @xmath9 radio in relativistic heavy - ion collisions from fopi / gsi @xcite , while the supersoft nuclear symmetry energy at supersaturation densities generally can not support a canonical  mass ( @xmath10 ) neutron star if the @xmath0-boson is not introduced @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-boson has also been introduced to describe the recently discovered new holder of neutron star maximum mass of @xmath11 @xmath12 from psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite using soft eos s consistent with existing terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments for hybrid neutron stars containing a quark core described by mit bag model using reasonable parameters @xcite , and it is found that the constraints on the @xmath0-boson properties are consistent with existing constraints from neutron - proton and neutron - lead scatterings nes08,kam08 as well as the spectroscopy of antiproton atoms @xcite .    in the studies about the @xmath0-boson influences on neutron star structure  @xcite ,",
    "the exchange term contribution of the @xmath0-boson to the nuclear matter eos has been neglected and only the direct term contribution has been considered , leading to that the nuclear matter eos depends only on the ratio the coupling strength to mass squared of the @xmath0-boson , namely , @xmath3 .",
    "physically , the exchange term contribution of the @xmath0-boson to the nuclear matter eos  will depend on both the coupling constant @xmath13 and the @xmath0-boson mass @xmath4 due to the finite - range interaction mediated by the @xmath0-boson .",
    "it is thus interesting to see how the exchange term contribution of the @xmath0-boson will influence the nuclear matter eos .",
    "furthermore , neutron stars are expected to have a solid inner crust surrounding a liquid core .",
    "knowledge on properties of the crust plays an important role in understanding many astrophysical observations bps71,bbp71,pet95a ,",
    "pet95b , lat00,lat07,ste05,lin99,hor04,bur06,owe05 .",
    "the inner crust spans the region from the neutron drip - out point to the inner edge separating the solid crust from the homogeneous liquid core . while the neutron drip - out density @xmath14 is relatively well determined to be about @xmath15 g/@xmath16 @xcite , the transition density @xmath1 at the inner edge is still largely uncertain mainly because of our very limited knowledge on the eos of neutron - rich nucleonic matter , especially the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "the transition density @xmath1 and the corresponding pressure @xmath2 at the inner edge might be measurable indirectly from observations of pulsar glitches @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0-boson can have significant influence on the nuclear matter eos , it is therefore very interesting to see how the @xmath0-boson will affect the inner edge of neutron star crusts .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate effects of the light vector @xmath0-boson on the transition density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 at the inner edge of neutron stars crust . the density matrix expansion ( dme ) approach neg72,xuj10b",
    "is used to describe the exchange term contribution of the finite - range interaction due to the @xmath0-boson exchange .",
    "based on the skyrme effective nucleon - nucleon interactions , we use three methods , i.e. , the thermodynamical approach , the curvature matrix approach and the vlasov equation approach to determine the transition density @xmath1 .",
    "as expected , our results indicate that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on not only the ratio of coupling strength to mass squared of the @xmath0-boson @xmath3 but also its mass @xmath4 due to the finite range interaction from the @xmath0-boson exchange .",
    "furthermore , we find that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are sensitive to both @xmath3 and @xmath4 if the @xmath0-boson mass @xmath4 is larger than about @xmath5 mev and both @xmath3 and @xmath4 can have significant influence on the mass - radius relation and the crustal fraction of total moment of inertia of neutron stars .",
    "we also demonstrate that the exchange term has minor influence on the nuclear matter eos as well as the @xmath17 and @xmath2 for the parameter values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 considered in this work .",
    "the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , defined by its binding energy per nucleon , can be expanded to @xmath5nd - order in isospin asymmetry @xmath18 as @xmath19where @xmath20 is the baryon density with @xmath21 and @xmath22 denoting the neutron and proton densities , respectively ; @xmath23 is the isospin asymmetry ; @xmath24 is the binding energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter , and the nuclear symmetry energy is expressed as @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eosanm ] ) , the absence of odd - order terms in @xmath18 is due to the exchange symmetry between protons and neutrons in nuclear matter when one neglects the coulomb interaction and assumes the charge symmetry of nuclear forces .",
    "the higher - order terms in @xmath18 are negligible , leading to the well - known empirical parabolic law for the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter , which has been verified by all many - body theories to date , at least for densities up to moderate values ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "in particular , the incompressibility @xmath34 of symmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density @xmath28 has been determined to be @xmath35 mev from analyses of the nuclear giant monopole resonances ( gmr ) @xcite , and its eos at densities of @xmath36 has also been constrained by measurements of collective flows @xcite and subthreshold kaon production @xcite in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , is largely unknown .",
    "although the nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath28 is known to be around @xmath37 mev from the empirical liquid - drop mass formula @xcite , its values at other densities , especially at supra - saturation densities , are poorly known @xcite . during the last decade",
    ", significant progress has been made both experimentally and theoretically on constraining the behavior of the symmetry energy at subsaturation density and the value of @xmath30 constrained from different experimental data or methods has become consistently convergent to about @xmath38 mev  @xcite ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent summary ) .",
    "furthermore , the ibuu04 transport model analysis of the fopi data on the @xmath9 ratio in central heavy - ion collisions at sis / gsi @xcite energies suggests a very soft symmetry energy at the supersaturation densities  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "these studies have significantly improved our understanding for the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter , which have important implications on the neutron star physics .      for the nuclear effective interaction , we use in the present work the so - called standard skyrme force ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    ", one can see that the @xmath286 indeed exhibits a clear sensitivity to the @xmath0-boson mass with a heavier @xmath0-boson mass giving a smaller @xmath286 for a fixed neutron star mass .",
    "in addition , one can see that using the @xmath1 obtained from the curvature matrix method gives a little larger value for @xmath286 at a fixed neutron star mass @xmath278 than using the @xmath1 from the vlasov equation method .",
    "empirically , the crustal fraction of total moment of inertia has been constrained as @xmath288 from studying the glitches of the vela pulsar  @xcite and the lower limit @xmath285 of the constraint is also indicated in fig .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ dim ] that the calculated results of @xmath286 with the two values of @xmath275 and @xmath235 mev using the @xmath1 obtained from either the curvature matrix method or the vlasov equation method are all consistent with the observation constraint of @xmath288 for the vela pulsar .",
    "based on the results above , we conclude that the vector @xmath0-boson can significantly stiffen the nuclear matter eos and thus enhance strongly the ( maximum ) mass of neutron stars .",
    "furthermore , as the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are sensitive to both @xmath3 and @xmath4 if the @xmath0-boson mass is larger than about @xmath5 mev , both @xmath3 and @xmath4 can thus affect the mass - radius relation of neutron stars although the maximum mass of neutron stars is essentially independent of the @xmath0-boson mass @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , our results demonstrate that the crustal fraction of total moment of inertia @xmath286 may depend sensitively on the @xmath0-boson mass @xmath4 for a fixed value of @xmath3 .",
    "using the thermodynamical approach , the curvature matrix approach and the vlasov equation approach with the skyrme effective nucleon - nucleon interaction , we have investigated effects of the light vector gauge @xmath0-boson , that is weakly coupled to nucleons , on the core - crust transition density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 of neutron stars . for the exchange term contribution of the @xmath0-boson , we have applied the density matrix expansion approach , which automatically leads to the density gradient terms in the single nucleon potential and nuclear energy density functional .",
    "our results have demonstrated that the exchange term contribution to energy per nucleon of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy is quite small and can be safely neglected compared with the direct term contribution for the parameter range of @xmath4 and @xmath3 considered in this work , verifying the validity of neglecting the @xmath0-boson exchange term contribution to the nuclear matter eos as have been done in the literature .",
    "furthermore , the exchange term has also been found to have negligible influence on the core - crust transition density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 , especially for very light @xmath0-boson .",
    "interestingly , our results have shown that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on not only the ratio of coupling strength to mass squared of the @xmath0-boson @xmath3 but also its mass @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0-boson mass dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is due to the finite range interaction from the @xmath0-boson exchange .",
    "especially , we have found that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be sensitive to both @xmath3 and @xmath4 if the @xmath0-boson mass @xmath4 is larger than about @xmath5 mev , and both @xmath3 and @xmath4 can have significant influence on the mass - radius relation and the crustal fraction of total moment of inertia of neutron stars .",
    "therefore , our results presented in this work have demonstrated that astrophysical observations on neutron star structures , such as the mass - radius relation and the crustal fraction of total moment of inertia from pulsar glitches , can be potentially useful to constrain properties of the @xmath0-boson , e.g. , its mass @xmath4 and the coupling constant @xmath13 to nucleons .",
