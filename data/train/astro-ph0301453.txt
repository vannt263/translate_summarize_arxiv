    ", it has also been used to study the distribution of the solar coronal plasma ( see for example ) .",
    "psr  b1821@xmath024is the second brightest magnetospheric x - ray pulsar in the sky @xcite .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity and millisecond period makes this pulsar a preferred target for the study of pulsar emission , as well as an excellent target to tie the clocks of satellite - borne x - ray detectors to utc (;",
    "hereafter , r98 ) .",
    "the radio profile consists of three components , the height and width of which exhibit significant variation across the decimeter band @xcite . in the 800 mhz band ,",
    "the two most prominent peaks ( rp1 and rp2 , separated by 107.61.4 degrees ; ) have narrow widths ( about 80@xmath1s ) .",

    "the asca clock was accurate to link the x - ray profile to the radio profile to no better than 200@xmath1s .",
    "using rxte , r98 demonstrated that xp1 , the stronger component , arrived after rp1 by @xmath3s .",
    "recently , becker  (; b02  hereafter ) described _ chandra_/acis - s spectral observations of the field of m28 sensitive to an x - ray flux limit of 6  s , finding 46 point sources .",
    "it was found that psr  b1821@xmath024  had a phase average spectrum corresponding to @xmath4=1.2 power - law with an equivalent hydrogen column density = 1.6 cm , confirming earlier phase - average spectral analysis @xcite .    here , we present a 50-ksec observation with the high resolution camera ( hrc ) aboard _ chandra _ obtained with 15.625@xmath5s temporal resolution ( `` s '' mode )",
    ". the principal goal of the observation was to tie the _",
    "chandra _ clock to utc at the accuracy of 10@xmath5s , to describe the sources of uncertainty in the utc time tie , and to confirm this tie with observations in the radio band .",
    "in addition , we present analysis of three _ rxte _  observations . finally , we took advantage of the imaging capability of the hrc and searched for pulsations in the 8 ( of 12 ) brightest x - ray sources in the field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : radio ] we describe the radio observations performed at nanay , from which the pulsar ephemeris ( uncorrected for a time - variable dispersion measure  dm ) was derived .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we briefly discuss the implications of these observational results , and conclude .",
    "the radio timing observations were conducted at the large decimetric radio telescope located near nanay  ( france ) .",
    "the collecting area is @xmath67000 @xmath7 , equivalent to a 93 meter dish .",
    "the system temperature was typically @xmath645  jy before the upgrade in 1999 - 2000 , after which it was improved to 25  jy .",
    "the maximum integration time of this transit telescope is 70 minutes .",
    "timing observations of psr  b1821@xmath024  are conducted 8 to 12 times a month at different radio frequencies .    at nanay ,",
    "the pulsar signal is de - dispersed by using a swept frequency oscillator ( around 80mhz ) in the receiver if chain , at a frequency of @xmath61410 mhz .",
    "the pulse spectra are produced by a digital autocorrelator with a frequency resolution between 6.25 and 25khz , depending on the observing frequency .",
    "the station ut time scale is provided by a local rubidium frequency standard .",
    "the offset relative to the international utc time scale was measured daily at 14hut via the observatory of paris by a special - purpose receiver using tv signals until december 1995 , with accuracy of 40  ns . after december 1995 ,",
    "a gps common view system with the observatory of paris was adopted and an even better link was achieved . with the nanaytiming system ,",
    "the frequency of arrival is measured by cross - correlation of the integrated pulse spectrum with a pulse template .",
    "the template profiles are constructed by integration of individual pulse profiles detected during our observations .",
    "the frequency of arrival measured for a start time of the nanaydedisperser is dual of the times of arrival measured by most other observatories .",
    "we will adopt the traditional term of time of arrival ( toa ) hereafter since the data analysis is ultimately based on pairs of times and frequencies of arrival .",
    "the data have been analysed by our software antiope using the jet propulsion laboratory ephemeris de405 for the earth orbital motion and for the spatial reference frame and the conventional utc time scale for time reference .",
    "the small corrections ut1-utc for the earth orientation have been applied .",
    "however , no corrections have been made for the time - variable dm in the direction of psr  b1821@xmath024 , which can affect the pulse toa by as much as @xmath650  @xmath1s   at 1410 mhz ( see the following section ) .",
    "more details on the analysis can be found in .    for jpl ephemeris de405 , we performed an analysis using pulsar toas from 1996 through 2002 .",

    "we refer to this ephemeris as the nanay  ephemeris .",
    "observations at radio wavelengths have found that the dm toward psr  b1821@xmath024  varies significantly on a year s timescale @xcite , with an time - average increase between 1989 oct and 1996 jan of 0.005 pc  cm  yr , or 10  @xmath1s  yr at 1410 mhz ; the increase in dm was not monotonic , but appears to be the result of a power spectrum of interstellar plasma turbulence @xcite . in 1996",
    "jan , the dm was measured to be 119.847(2 )  pc  cm .",
    "radio observations from nanay  at 1280 , 1410 and 1680 mhz , taken between jan and sept 2002 , measured the dm . a mean value of 119.873(5 ) pc  cm",

    "this is comparable to the value expected by extrapolating the 1989 - 1996 time average increase .",
    "observations were performed with the _ chandra_/hrc - s detector @xcite .",
    "the hrc - s has timing resolution of 15.625  @xmath1s , a nominal energy response of 0.1 - 2 kev , and essentially no energy resolution .",
    "the observation began 2002 nov 8 5:41 ut , integrating for 49148  sec and a total livetime of 49068  sec ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "data were analysed using ciao v2.3 and caldb v2.18 .",
    "the absolute astrometry of observation ( from telescope pointing ) was checked using the present knowledge of its accuracy ; no known astrometric problems were found , and the absolute pointing accuracy is 0.6 , 1@xmath17 .",
    "we identify psr  b1821@xmath024  near its _ chandra _  pointing position ; a power - density spectrum of the x - ray source counts @xcite finds the pulsation with the appropriate period ( @xmath18327 hz ) .",
    "we used psr  b1821@xmath024  for absolute astrometry , adopting for its position the nanayradio ephemeris position ( see    [ sec : radio ] ) .",
    "we created an image using wavdetect , first binning the raw hrc image ( 0.13175  per pixel ) by a factor of 2 and searching for sources on scales of a factor of 1 , 2 and 4 larger .",
    "the resulting reconstructed wavelet image is shown in fig .  [",

    "we detected 13 sources within 2.6  of the cluster center .",
    "for each source , the absolute positions , fixed relatively to the radio position of psr  b1821@xmath024 and x - ray countrates are given in table  [ tab : catalog ] .    to obtain comparative background , we extracted counts from two circular regions 21  in radius , set off from the cluster center by 32  and 37 , which did not include any identified point sources . in these",
    ", we found a total of 8583 background counts , which corresponds to a total of 9.70.1 background counts in a 1  radius region .",
    "b02  found an excess diffuse x - ray component associated with m28 which extends to the core radius , which they attribute to unresolved point sources . to examine the contribution to background from this diffuse component , as well as from the extended point - spread function of point sources inside the core",
    ", we examined the countrate in two 4.47  circles within the core radius , the boundaries of which are @xmath192  from any resolved point source .",
    "these regions had countrates of 11.50.5 counts in a 1 arcsec radius region integrated over the livetime of the observation , an excess of 1.80.5 counts over the more distant background regions , confirming the excess diffuse emission found by b02 .",
    "we assume a distance of 5.5 kpc to m28 @xcite . throughout",
    ", we apply an energy correction factor of 1.42  s  or 5.18  s  ( 0.1 - 2.0 kev ) per 1 hrc - s count / sec , which is the x - ray flux corrected for absorption , assuming = 1.6 cm and a power - law photon spectral slope of @xmath20 , as observed for psr  b1821@xmath024  ( b02 ) .",
    "alternatively , 1 hrc - s count / sec is 4.23  s  or 1.54  s  ( 0.5 - 8.0 kev ) , unabsorbed , approximately a factor of 3.0 higher than in the 0.1 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "we process the raw event times in the following manner ( see    [ sec : times ] for the detailed discussion of time corrections and their uncertainties ) .",
    "the event times delivered ( that is , which are given in the data files known as the event-1 and event-2 files ) require two steps to place them in the jpl  de405 reference frame barycenter ( tdb ) .",
    "first , they are corrected for _ chandra_command - control - data - management propagation time ( see   [ sec : times ] ) by adding :        counts from each source were extracted from within @xmath62circles around source positions .",
    "the time - average luminosity of psr  b1821@xmath024 , found from the average hrc - s background subtracted countrate , is ( 4.00.2 )  s(0.1 - 2.0 kev ) , consistent with the time - average value found by b02  ( 1.280.02  s , 0.5 - 8.0 kev ) after correcting for different passbands .",
    "we performed a fourier transform on the barycentered lightcurves , with the time resolution 15.625  @xmath1s , 630262500 time bins , and a frequency resolution of 2.0308998 hz using fftw @xcite . with the complex transform , we produced a leahy - normalized power density spectrum ( pds ; ) of each source .",
    "examination of the pulsar harmonics in the pds show the pulsation is strongly detected up to the 16th harmonic . to obtain the best - fit frequency , we convolved the discrete fourier transform window function with the pds within 10 frequency bins of each harmonic for a trial frequency , and mapped the sum of the convolution as a function of trial frequency , with frequencies over - resolved by a factor of 32 ( twice the number of harmonics ) , taking the peak of the curve to be the best - fit frequency 327.40562430(5 ) hz , consistent with that determined from the radio ephemeris .",
    "the change in frequency over the course of our observation is small compared to our uncertainty .    after determining this frequency ,",
    "we extracted data about the position of psr  b1821@xmath024  within a 1  circle ; this decreases our background counts by a factor of 4 over a 2  circle ( from @xmath212 to 11.50.5 ) .",
    "the enclosed number of counts decreased from 446 to 396 counts , indicating a loss of @xmath615.40.5 source counts ( 4% ) . using the nanay  ephemeris ( table  [ tab : ephem ] ) to determine the relative pulsar phase at the time start time of the observation      which we found to be @xmath23 periods .",
    "we folded this data in time at the x - ray measured pulsar frequency , and corrected the phase to the nanay  radio ephemeris .",
    "this folded x - ray lightcurve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaselc ] in differential and integral form .",
    "two x - ray peaks are evident in the pulsed lightcurve , a `` sharp '' peak near @xmath9=0.64 ( xp1 ) and a `` dull '' peak near @xmath9=0.21 ( xp2 ) .",
    "xp1 is associated in phase with the radio component rp1 ; r98 found xp1 followed rp1 at 800 mhz by 204 milli - periods .",
    "we refer to this x - ray peak xp1 .",
    "xp2 , however , has no obvious corresponding component in the radio band .",
    "xp1 has a maximum countrate , averaged over 30.54  @xmath1s , of ( 67 counts)/(0.01@xmath2449.068 ksec)= 13516 hrc - s counts  ksec , corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity of ( 7.00.7 )  s(0.1 - 2.0 kev ) .",
    "xp2 has an intrinsic peak luminosity of ( 2.30.4 )  s.    we examined counts outside of the main pulses to determine if they are consistent with the number expected from background .",
    "we summed all the counts , excluding those within a phase of 0.15 of xp1 and xp2 , finding a total of 29 counts , where we expect 4.60.2 counts due to background .",
    "this is a detection of excess counts with a probability of @xmath23 as being due to a fluctuation in the background countrate .",
    "treating the excess counts as a constant intensity , the time - average countrate is ( 29 - 4.6)/(@xmath25 ksec)= 1.20.2 hrc - s counts  ksec , which is 153% of the time - average countrate of psr  b1821@xmath024 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity of the unpulsed component is ( 6.21 )  s(0.1 - 2 kev ) .      standard fourier analysis searches @xcite are most appropriate for the sinusoidal or near - sinusoidal pulsations seen from isolated neutron star sources @xcite and some x - ray binary pulsars @xcite . in searching for x - ray pulsations from fast radio pulsars , on the other hand",

    "the maximum single - harmonic power is found in the second harmonic , which has @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the normalization , and the individual harmonic powers do not drop below the 99.9% confidence level until the 24th harmonic . in a blind search for pulsations in this dataset",
    ", the maximum - significance detection would come in a sum of the first 23 harmonics , which provide a total power of @xmath28 and a single - trial false - alarm probability of @xmath29 .",
    "searches for a pulsar weaker than psr  b1821@xmath024  should be more conservative in approach ; reducing the observed harmonic powers of the pulsar by a factor of ten results in a most - significant detection for the sum of the first thirteen harmonics only , with the addition of further harmonics weakening the detection .",
    "we performed a pulse search of the strongest eight sources in the field , apart from psr  b1821@xmath024 , summing the first ten harmonics and covering the 0.001  hz to 2  khz frequency range for the fundamental . even at the upper boundary of this frequency range ,",
    "our tenth harmonic frequency is less than the 32  khz nyquist frequency of our observations .",
    "we used the @xmath30 search technique for photon event lists @xcite . at full frequency resolution",
    ", this results in roughly @xmath31 independent trials and should allow us to be sensitive to summed powers of 95 or more , roughly 6.5% the strength of the signal for psr  b1821@xmath024 .",
    "we did not find any convincing candidate pulsations in this sample . in three cases ,",
    "our maximum power exceeds the nominal threshold of 95 , but only slightly less - significant triggers at unrelated frequencies are also apparent , which make the highest - power triggers not credible .",
    "we are not certain of the cause of this anomalous power , but note that the hrc detector is subject to deadtime effects , which will cause the photons from the pulsar psr  b1821@xmath024  to impose non - poisson patterns on the data of other sources in the field .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr]a , we compare the hrc - s countrates with the acis - i countrates for all sources detected ( in both detectors ) within 160  of the center of m28 . for the acis - i countrate",
    ", we summed the countrates in the 0.2 - 1.0 and 1.0 - 2.0 kev bands listed by b02 .",
    "the different quantum efficiencies and background countrates make for different detection limits for the two detectors . for the sources which were detected in both observations , the relation between countrates in the two different detectors was approximately i(acis - i ) = ( i(hrc - s)/0.4 c  ksec )",
    "c  ksec , with a systematic uncertainty of a factor of 2 .",
    "two sources detected in the hrc observation were not detected by b02(sources # 3 and # 12 , using our numbering , table  [ tab : catalog ] ) .",
    "the brighter ( # 3 ) , had an hrc countrate of 0.70.1 c  ksec , which would produce an acis - i countrate of 1.1 c  ksec ( 0.3 dex ) , well above the limit of @xmath20.12 c  ksec , if its spectrum were the same as the other detected sources . to account for",
    "the non - detection with acis - i , the photon spectral slope of source # 3 would have to be @xmath32 , which is far steeper than for any known x - ray source .",
    "we suggest that source # 3 is variable .",
    "source # 12 was detected with hrc - s at 0.30.1 c  ksec , which would produce an acis - i countrate of 0.8 ( 0.3 dex ) c/  ksec .",
    "we did not detect 30 of the 41 sources detected by b02  in our 160  image radius ( undetected b02  sources in order of decreasing total countrate , using the numbering of b02 : 28 , 32 , 30 , 8 , 14 , 33 , 21 , 31 , 16 , 10 , 20 , 11 , 6 , 35 , 39 , 27 , 24 , 34 , 7 , 42 , 9 , 13 , 40 , 12 , 18 , 46 , 43 , 15 , 44 , 5 ) .",
    "all of these would have had hrc - s countrates at or below the hrc - s detection limit , with the exception of b02 s source # 28 , which was detected with acis - i at 3.20.3 c  ksec , which would have produced 1.3 hrc - s c  ksec  ( 0.3 dex , assuming a similar spectrum as other detected sources ) , instead of @xmath20.3 c  ksec .",
    "although this source was not found by wavdetect , we extracted counts from within a 1  radius of the position found by b02 , and found a background subtracted number of counts of 165 , corresponding to 0.30.1 c  ksec , indicating that the source has faded by a factor @xmath194.32.2 .",
    "figure [ fig : cr]b shows hrc - s countrate vs. the softness ratio ( 0.2 - 1.0 kev/2.0 - 8.0 kev ) for sources from b02  ( b02sources 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 34 , 35 , 39 , 40 , 42 , 43 , 44 , and 46 were excluded because they have acis - i single - band countrates and/or softness ratios consistent with zero )",
    ". the softness ratios of sources not detected by the hrc - s observation have large relative uncertainties , but as a group they are not spectrally harder than the sources we detected .",
    "thus , most of the non - detections in the hrc - s seem to be due to the lower sensitivity of the hrc - s relative to the acis - i , most likely due to the higher background countrate in the hrc - s detector .      the accuracy of the hrc event time tags ( after correction for their location in telemetry - see )",
    "is limited by : ( 1 ) digitization in the hrc time value ; ( 2 ) the stability of the spacecraft clock relative to ephemeris time ; and ( 3 ) knowledge of the absolute relation of the spacecraft time to utc ( that is , the command - control - data - management ( ccdm ) propagation time ) .",
    "the magnitude of each of these are tabulated in table  [ tab : uncertainties ] .",
    "event times for the hrc @xcite are generated by measuring the time of the event since the beginning of a reference time ( called the science header frame , which occurs every eighth telemetry frame or @xmath33@xmath34sec ) .",
    "this relative event time is digitized to 15.625  @xmath1s  due to the number of telemetry bits available ( 18 bits available to count the spacecraft interface unit clock that runs at 1.024  mhz or 0.9765625  @xmath1s  count so the hrc time tags are in units of 16 counts of this 1.024  mhz clock [ = 15.626  @xmath1s ] to span the 2.050 sec interval ) .",
    "thus the digitization uncertainty in hrc times is , on average , 5  @xmath1s .",
    "the spacecraft clock which governs the telemetry is based on the use of an ultra - stable oscillator ( uso ) , running at a nominal frequency of 8.192  mhz , on board the observatory , with periodic time tagging of the spacecraft clock at the receiving ground stations of the deep space network ( dsn ) .",
    "typically , the chandra observatory will have a dsn contact for about 1 hour every 8 hours , during which real - time telemetry is received at the ground stations ( as well as solid state recorder dumps ) .",
    "the real time data ( usually 30 minutes or more ) are time tagged with the antenna arrival time providing a series of correlations between the spacecraft clock counter ( which has a nominal period of 0.25625 sec / count ) and jpl ephemeris time .",
    "the chandra science center flight operations team ( fot ) @xcite fit these correlations to a simple second order polynomial , and the residuals are analyzed to provide a measure of the stability of the clock .",
    "the typical rms residual measured from these data is 5  @xmath1s  or less .",
    "the measurements show occasional excursions to 10@xmath34@xmath35sec ; monitoring of these correlations over the operational lifetime of the observatory has detected no larger anomalies in the spacecraft clock stability .",
    "there is an observed secular trend in the clock period ( 0.25625000905 sec / count to 0.25625001046 sec / count over a 1016 day interval ) , which is due to cumulative radiation dose to the electronics , and is fully compensated for through the correlation function . thus , the uncertainty in the time - tag due to the stability of the spacecraft clock relative to ephemeris time is 5  @xmath1s .",
    "the knowledge of the absolute time for chandra data comes from the time tagging of data at the receiving ( ground ) antenna , and a knowledge of all of the propagation time delays between the spacecraft and the antenna , and any delays at the ground station between the utc clock and the time tagging .",
    "the fot has determined the sum of all of the systematic delays  including the delay on the spacecraft  of 281.25  @xmath1s  @xcite which is the propagation time of the spacecraft clock though the various elements of the spacecraft command , control , and data management system ( ccdm ) .",
    "these systematic delay times are believed to be accurate to @xmath3610  @xmath1s .",
    "this uncertainty includes the resolution of the utc clock at the antenna , errors in propagation delays due to orbit errors , errors in the ccdm propagation time , and errors in ground propagation times .    in the case of the chandra science instrument time",
    "tagging , the ccdm propagation time is incorrectly applied to the event times during pipeline data processing and must be removed from the distributed event times ( that is , @xmath37  @xmath1s , for both the level 1 and level 2 event files ) .",
    "however , this processing error is totally systematic and adds no additional uncertainty to the absolute time once it is corrected .",
    "thus the overall uncertainty in absolute event time is estimated by assuming the three errors are uncorrelated and can be root square summed to yield @xmath38  @xmath1s . of these three sources of uncertainty , only the 10  @xmath1s  ccdm propagation time can  in principle  be better characterized and eliminated as a source of uncertainty .",
    "thus , future ccdm characterization may ultimately decrease the time - tag uncertainty to 7  @xmath1s .",
    "we analysed all three observations performed with the rxte / pca as listed in table  [ tab : obs ] , the first of which ( sept 1996 ) has previously been analysed ( r98 ) . during the sept 1996 and feb 1997 observations , all five pcu units were operating , while during the nov 1999 observation , only three of the five pcu units were operating .",
    "we used ftools v5.1a ( release 16 jan 2002 ) .",
    "all data were obtained in good xenon mode , which has time resolution of @xmath39sec ( @xmath40sec ) .",
    "we selected events detected in the first detector layer only with an approximate energy range of 224 kev , selecting all pulse height analyser ( pha ) channels beginning at channel 0 ( where the instrumental cut - off is 2 kev ) and up to 24 kev , depending on the detector voltage settings .",
    "we barycentered the events into the de405 time system using axbary in the ciao release used for the _ chandra _  analysis ; this applies the 16  @xmath1sec intrinsic delay of the pca instrument , the _ rxte _  fine clock corrections , and the addition of the timezero keyparameter . the absolute systematic uncertainty of the rxte / pca event times in tdb is estimated to be 5  @xmath1s  after mjd 50567 ( 1997 apr 29 ut ) , and 8  @xmath1s  prior to mjd 50567 ( table  [ tab : uncertainties ] ) .",
    "this level of accuracy is established by calibration several times daily by the rxte mission operations center , ultimately limited by the accuracy of the ground clock used for this calibration at white sands . a detailed discussion of this timing calibration is given in r98 .",
    "we used the nanay  ephemeris to calculate the phase of each event , and produced a folded pulsar lightcurve . in each , the background countrate is significant , such that the persistent countrate for the pulsar is well below the detection limit .        in fig .",

    "we show the derived o - c values in fig .",

    "2 lies at the origin .",
    "the two observations ( # 3 and 4 ) are consistent with an absolute offset of the x - ray time delay from the radio time delay , found by a @xmath60 best - fit assuming an x - ray / radio delay slope of 1 and neglecting the uncertainty in the radio phase :        the uncertainty in the position and proper motion of the pulsar will not affect the relative x - ray / radio phase offset , such as that we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : money ] .",
    "an incorrect geometric assumption which results in a deviation in the radio pulse phase relative to the baseline ephemeris will also result in a deviation in the x - ray pulse phase measured at the same time , since a deviation in geometry affects only light travel time , affecting the x - ray and radio bands equally , which is not what we observe .      in the nanay  ephemeris",
    ", the phase @xmath10 corresponds to an average phase over the duration of the ephemeris of zero for rp2 . assuming that @xmath70=0.299(4 ) @xcite , and taking the @xmath71=0.020(4 ) from r98 , we can find the difference between the presently measured phase of xp1 and that from the phasing of r98 :      taking values from table  [ tab : phases ] , we find that for observations 1 - 4 , this difference amounts to @xmath73  @xmath1s , @xmath73  @xmath1s , @xmath023020  @xmath1s , and @xmath025020  @xmath1s , respectively .",
    "thus , all four measured values of the x - ray phases for xp1 in the present work are in disagreement with that found by r98 , including obs .  1 ( the same data as analysed by r98 ) .",
    "it is difficult to see how the present measurements can be resolved with that of r98 . the relative phase of xp1 is similar in all three rxte observations ( within 60  @xmath1s ) to that of the _ chandra _  phase , within the nanay  ephemeris  a smaller variation than the @xmath6200  @xmath1s  discrepancy .",
    "as we find similar phases in both the _ chandra_/hrc - s observation and the three rxte / pca observations , it does not appear to be due to a satellite calibration issue .",
    "the discrepancy may be due in part to the differing radio ephemeris of nanay  with that used by r98 ( found using green bank and jodrell bank telescopes and a different observational techniques , in a different radio passband ) .",
    "dm corrections were applied to the r98 epehemeris , although not to the present ephemeris ; however , the variable dm can amount to at most @xmath650  @xmath1s  delay , which is smaller than the @xmath74  @xmath1s  to @xmath75  @xmath1s  difference we see here .",
    "we have performed fast timing of psr  b1821@xmath024  with _ chandra_/hrc - s , resolving the sharpest x - ray peak xp1 with a width 343  @xmath1s .",
    "this also serves as a limit on a random timing calibration uncertainty variation over this 50 ksec observation .",
    "in addition , we place a limit of @xmath23 s  s ( 90% confidence ) on a linear - drift in the relative timing calibration of the hrc - s",
    ". moreover , the gaussian width of this component limits the width of the x - ray pulse beam as it passes across the line of sight to be 4.00.4 degrees .",
    "we detect for the first time persistent x - ray emission in psr  b1821@xmath024 , at a level of 153% of the time - average x - ray flux , assuming identical spectra for the pulsed and non - pulsed emission .",
    "we also find trailing x - ray emission , significantly in excess of the emission leading both pulse components .",
    "the absolute tie of the hrc - s instrument to tdb / utc time standard compared with the known 5  @xmath1s  capability of _ rxte _  is confirmed with the precision limited by the alignment of the xp1 relative to the nanay  ephemeris of the hrc - s and three _ rxte_/pca datasets .",
    "we observe that the four pulse lightcurves are significantly mis - aligned , offset by as much as 67  @xmath1s .",
    "this mis - alignment appears to be due to the time - variable dm in the direction of psr  b1821@xmath024  over the 1996 - 2002 period , during which the _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations were made .",
    "the known time - dependent dm , measured elsewhere , results in a change in the toa of the radio pulse  but not in the x - ray pulse  of the order of that observed .",
    "a correction to the radio pulse toa can be applied to the nanaydata , using dm measurements obtained at nanay  in the radio band taken from 1996 - 2002 .",
    "this analysis is under way ( backer and cognard , in progress ) .",
    "once this correction is applied , the radio pulsed lightcurve data can be aligned absolutely in phase with the x - ray pulsed lightcurve , which can confirm _ in situ _ the _ chandra_/hrc - s absolute timing capability to the accuracy of the known uncertainties in the rxte timing ( 5  @xmath1s ) and the _ chandra_/hrc - s timing ( 12  @xmath1s ) .",
    "pulsar timing noise has yet to be measured in the x - ray band .",
    "the present observations demonstrate that the technical capability exists to do so for psr  b1821@xmath024  in the presently operating x - ray observatories _ rxte _  and _ chandra_. repeated x - ray timing observations of psr  b1821@xmath024  would produce a pulse - ephemeris independent of the effects of a time - varying dm , without having to measure the dm for each observation as required for this and other millisecond pulsars ( such as psr  1951 + 32 , ; psr  1821 + 05 , ; psr  1557 - 50 , ; psr 1855 + 09 , psr 1937 + 21 , ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray band provides the capability of measuring pulsar timing noise without a time - variable dm correction .",
    "such observations would provide confirmation of the attribution of pulsar timing noise to spin - down processes , rather than for example , to processes associated with magnetospheric emission .",
