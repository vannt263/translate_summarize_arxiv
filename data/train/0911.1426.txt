    "relay - aided wireless systems , also called multi - hop systems , are implemented to increase the coverage and the throughput of communication systems @xcite .",
    "these systems are becoming important parts of developing wireless communication standards , such as ieee 802.16j ( also known as wimax ) @xcite .",
    "half - duplex relays , which transmit and receive data in different times and/or frequencies , are proven to be more practical and cost efficient in such standards than full - duplex relays .    from information",
    "theoretical point of view , the capacity becomes larger when more relays are added to the system .",
    "however , designing optimum strategies , especially in half - duplex systems , is challenging because subtle scheduling , _ i.e. _ , timing among transmission modes , is required to achieve rates near the capacity of such systems . during the last decade , the main stream of research carried out by several researchers dealt with single relay communication systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a simple model for investigating the potential benefits of a system with multiple relays is a dual - hop configuration with two parallel half - duplex relays ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this configuration does not cover all two - relay systems because there are no source - destination and relay - relay links .",
    "however , it captures the basic difficulty in finding the best strategy in the system .",
    "as will be shown in this paper , a single strategy falls short of achieving rates near the capacity of the system for all channel realizations .",
    "the single relay channel in which the relay facilitates a point - to - point communication was first studied in @xcite .",
    "two important coding techniques , _ decode - and - forward _ and _ compress - and - forward _ , were proposed in @xcite . in the decode - and - forward scheme ,",
    "the relay decodes the received message . in the compress - and - forward scheme",
    ", the relay sends the compressed ( quantized ) version of the received data to the destination .",
    "following @xcite , generalizations to multi - relay networks were investigated by several researchers .",
    "a comprehensive survey of the progress in this area can be found in @xcite .    a simple model for understanding some aspects of the multi - relay networks is a network with two parallel relays , as introduced in @xcite , and fig .",
    "it is assumed that there are no direct links from the source to the destination and also between the relays .",
    "this channel is studied in @xcite and @xcite , and referred to as the _ diamond relay channel _ in @xcite .    for full - duplex relays , schein and gallager , in @xcite and @xcite , provided upper and lower bounds on the capacity of the diamond channel . in particular , they considered the _ amplify - and - forward _ , and the decode - and - forward schemes , as well as a hybrid of them based on the time - sharing principle .",

    "_ suggested a _ combined amplify - and - decode - forward _ strategy and proved that their scheme always performs better than the rematch - and - forward scheme @xcite .",
    "in addition , they showed that the time - sharing between the combined amplify - and - decode - forward and decode - and - forward schemes provides a better achievable rate when compared to the time - sharing between the amplify - and - forward and decode - and - forward , and also between the rematch - and - forward and decode - and - forward , considered in @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "kang and ulukus employed a combination of the decode - and - forward and compress - and - forward schemes to obtain the capacity of a special class of the diamond channel with a noiseless relay @xcite .",
    "ghabeli and aref in @xcite proposed a new achievable rate based on the generalized block markov encoding @xcite .",
    "they also showed that their scheme achieves the capacity of a class of deterministic relay networks .",
    "half - duplex relays are studied in @xcite .",
    "xue and sandhu in @xcite proposed several schemes including the multi - hop with spatial reuse , scale - forward , broadcast - multiaccess with common message , compress - and - forward , and hybrid methods .",
    "these authors demonstrated that the _ multi - hop with spatial reuse _ protocol can achieve the channel capacity if the parallel links have the same capacity . unlike @xcite , which assumed no direct link exists between the relays , @xcite considered such link .",
    "more specifically , chang , _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a combined dirty paper coding and block markov encoding scheme @xcite . using numerical examples , they showed that the gap between their proposed strategy and the upper bound is relatively small in most cases .",
    "rezaei , _ et al .",
    "_ considered two scheduling algorithms , namely _ successive _ and _ simultaneous _ relaying @xcite .",
    "they derived asymptotic capacity results for the successive relaying and also proposed an achievable rate for the simultaneous relaying using a combination of the amplify - and - forward and decode - and - forward schemes .",
    "other related papers are @xcite .",
    "characterizing the capacity of an information theoretic channel may be difficult .",
    "a simpler , yet important approach is to find an achievable scheme that ensures a small gap from the capacity of the channel .",
    "recently , etkin _ et al .",
    "_ characterized the capacity region of the interference channel to within one bit @xcite . following this new capacity analysis perspective , avestimehr _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a deterministic model to better analyze the general single - source single - destination and the single - source multi - destination gaussian networks @xcite .",
    "their _ quantize - and - map _ achievablity scheme is guaranteed to provide a rate that is within a constant number of bits ( determined by the graph topology of the network ) from the cut - set upper bound .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] [ fig : model ]      in this paper , the setup and assumptions used in @xcite , with no link between the relays , are followed . in @xcite , the multi - hop with spatial reuse scheme proved to achieve the capacity of the diamond channel if the capacities of the parallel links in fig .",
    "1 are equal .",
    "this is called the _ multi - hopping decode - and - forward _ ( mdf ) scheme . in the mdf scheme ,",
    "relays successively forward their decoded messages to the destination ( see forward modes i and ii in fig .",
    "2 ) . by introducing a fundamental parameter of the channel @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we generalize the optimality condition of the mdf scheme .",
    "in particular , we show that whenever @xmath9 , the cut - set upper bound can be achieved . we also show that the mdf scheme can not have a small gap from the cut - set upper bound for all channel realizations because the optimum strategy is highly related to the value of @xmath4 .    in @xcite",
    ", the aim has been to establish the constant gap argument for the general relay networks with a single source and not to obtain a small gap optimized for a specific channel , such as the diamond channel . for the half - duplex diamond channel , the expression for the gap derived in @xcite results in a 6-bit gap . in this paper , however , we focus on the diamond channel and obtain a smaller gap using our proposed achievablity scheme . in addition , we provide closed - form expressions for the time intervals associated with the transmission modes in the proposed scheduling . specifically , we show that the expressions are different from those of the cut - set upper bound .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite , where the constant gap between the cut - set bound and the quantize - and - map scheme was assured for every fixed scheduling , including the optimum scheduling associated with the cut - set upper bound .    in @xcite , using a different achievablity ( a partial decode - and - forward ) scheme than the quantize - and - map scheme , avestimehr _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the capacity of the _ full - duplex _ diamond channel can be characterized within 1 bit per real dimension , regardless of the values of the channel gains .",
    "however , applying this scheme to the _ half - duplex _ diamond channel does not guarantee a constant gap from the channel capacity .",
    "we take one further step by providing an achievable scheme that ensures a small gap from the upper bounds for the half - duplex diamond channel . in particular , we show that the gap is smaller than .71 bits , assuming all transmitters have constant power constraints .",
    "we also prove that when transmitters have average power constraints instead , the gap is less than 3.6 bits .",

    "as will be shown in the sequel , the sign of @xmath4 plays an important role in designing the optimum scheduling for the channel .    in this setup ,",
    "the cut - set bounds can be stated in the form of a linear program ( lp ) due to the assumption of constant power constraints for all transmitters . by analyzing the dual program we provide fairly tight upper bounds expressed as single equations corresponding to different channel conditions . using the dual problem",

    "we show that the mdf scheme provides the gap of less than @xmath54 bits when applied in the symmetric or some classes of asymmetric diamond channels .",
    "more importantly , we explain that the gap can be arbitrarily large for certain ranges of parameters .    by employing new scheduling algorithms",
    "we shrink the gap to @xmath55 bits for _ all _ channel conditions .",
    "in particular , for @xmath8 we add broadcast ( bc ) mode ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) to the mdf scheme to provide the relays with more reception time . in this three - mode scheme , referred to as multi - hopping decode - and - forward with broadcast ( _ mdf - bc _ ) scheme , the relays decode what they have received from source and forward the re - encoded information to destination in forward modes i and ii . when @xmath7 , multiple - access ( mac ) mode ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) in which the relays transmit independent information to destination is added to the mdf scheme .",
    "we call this protocol multi - hopping decode - and - forward with multiple - access ( _ mdf - mac _ ) scheme .",
    "the mentioned contributions are associated with the case wherein the transmitters are operating under constant power constraints ( [ eq : constant_power ] ) . however , for a more general setting in which the transmitters are subject to average power constraints ( [ eq : average_power ] ) , it is shown in appendix [ appendix : general average power ] that the cut - set upper bounds are increased by at most @xmath56 bits . therefore , the proposed achievable schemes guarantee the maximum gap of 3.6 bits from the cut - set upper bounds in the general average power constraint setting .",
    "the proposed achievable scheme may employ all four transmission modes as follows :    1 .",
    "_ * broadcast mode * _ : in @xmath57 fraction of the transmission time , source broadcasts independent information to relays 1 and 2 using the superposition coding technique .",
    "2 .   _ * forward mode i * _ : in @xmath58 fraction of the transmission time , source transmits new information to relay 1 . at the same time , relay 2 sends the re - encoded version of part of the data received during broadcast mode and/or forward mode ii of the previous block to destination .",
    "_ * forward mode ii * _ : in @xmath59 fraction of the transmission time , source transmits new information to relay 2 . at the same time , relay 1 sends the re - encoded version of part of what it has received during broadcast mode and/or forward mode i of the previous block to destination .",
    "* multiple - access mode * _ : in the remaining @xmath60 fraction of the transmission time , relays 1 and 2 simultaneously transmit the residual information ( corresponding to the previous block ) to destination where , _ joint decoding _ is performed to decode the received data .    in broadcast mode ,",
    "superposition coding , which is known to be the optimal transmission scheme for the degraded broadcast channel @xcite , is used to transmit independent data to the relays .",
    "the resulting data - rates @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively associated with relay 1 and relay 2 are : @xmath63 @xmath64 the power allocation parameter @xmath65 determines the amount of source power used to transmit information to the relay with better channel quality in broadcast mode .    in multiple - access mode , a multiple - access channel exists in which the users ( relays ) have independent messages for destination . for this channel ,",
    "joint decoding is optimum , which provides the following rate region @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the rates that relay 1 and relay 2 provide to destination in multiple - access mode , respectively , and @xmath68 is defined as : @xmath69    according to the protocol , relay 1 can receive up to @xmath70 bits per channel use during broadcast mode and forward mode i. then the relay has the opportunity to send its received information to destination in forward mode ii and multiple - access mode , with the rate @xmath71 . similarly , relay 2 can receive and forward messages with the rates @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the maximum achievable rate of the scheme , @xmath74 , is : @xmath75    sections [ sec : delta0]-[sec : mdf - mac ] show that employing forward modes i and ii for @xmath5 , the first three transmission modes for @xmath8 , and the last three transmission modes for @xmath7 are sufficient to achieve a small gap from the derived upper bounds .",
    "for general half - duplex networks with @xmath76 relays , khojastepour",
    "_ et al . _",
    "proposed a cut - set type upper bound by doing the following steps :    1 .",
    "fix the input distribution and scheduling , _ i.e. _ , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 such that @xmath79 .",
    "find the rate @xmath80 associated with the cut @xmath81 for each transmission mode @xmath30 where @xmath82 .",
    "3 .   multiply @xmath80 by the corresponding time interval @xmath83 .",
    "4 .   compute @xmath84 and minimize it over all cuts .",
    "take the supremum over all input distributions and schedulings .",
    "the preceding procedure can be directly applied to the diamond channel , whose transmission modes are shown in fig .",
    "the best input distribution and scheduling lead to : @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the capacity of the diamond channel .",
    "the above bounds do not decrease if each mutual information term is replaced by its maximum value .",
    "this substitution simplifies the computation of the upper bound , called @xmath87 , by providing the following lp @xcite : @xmath88 to obtain appropriate single - equation upper bounds on the capacity , we rely on the fact that every feasible point in the dual program provides an upper bound on the primal .",
    "hence , we develop the desired upper bounds by looking at the dual program . in the sequel , we derive the dual program for the lp ( [ eq : cut - set - org ] ) .",
    "we start with writing the lp in the standard form as : @xmath89 where the unknown vector @xmath90^{t}$ ] , the vectors of coefficients @xmath91^{t}$ ] , and the matrix of coefficients @xmath15 is :    ll * a*&= (    ccccc -c_012 & -c_01 & -c_02 & 0 & 1 + -c_01 & -(c_01+c_23 ) & 0 & -c_23 & 1 + -c_02 & 0 & -(c_02+c_13 ) & -c_13 & 1 + 0 & -c_23 & -c_13 & -c_123 & 1 + 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 +    ) .    since @xmath92 , it is easy to verify that the primal and dual programs share the same form , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath93 in the dual program ( [ eq : dual ] ) , @xmath94 , for @xmath95 corresponds to the @xmath30th rate constraint in the primal lp ( [ eq : cut - set - org ] ) .",
    "clearly , the lp ( [ eq : cut - set - org ] ) is _",
    "hence , the duality of linear programming ensures that there is no gap between the primal and the dual solutions @xcite .",
    "however , the benefit of using the dual problem here is that any feasible choice of the vector @xmath96 provides an upper bound to the rate obtained by solving the original lp .",
    "this property is known as the weak duality property of lp @xcite .",
    "appropriate vectors ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath96 s ) in the dual program ( [ eq : dual ] ) are selected to obtain fairly tight upper bounds .",
    "in fact , employing such vectors instead of solving the primal lp ( [ eq : cut - set - org ] ) simplifies the gap analysis . in sections [ sec : mdf - bc ] and",
    "[ sec : mdf - mac ] , these vectors are provided for @xmath8 and @xmath7 cases , respectively . in the following sections , we employ the proposed achievable schemes together with the derived upper bounds to characterize the capacity of the diamond channel up to 0.71 bits .",
    "in this section , the mdf scheme is described and then proved to be capacity - achieving when @xmath5 .",
    "the mdf scheduling algorithm uses two transmission modes : forward modes i and ii shown in fig . 2 along with the decode - and - forward strategy and can be described as follows :    1 .   in @xmath97 fraction of the transmission time ,",
    "source and relay 2 transmit to relay 1 and destination , respectively .",
    "2 .   in the remaining @xmath98 fraction of the transmission time ,",
    "source and relay 1 transmit to relay 2 and destination , respectively",
    ".    the achievable rate of the mdf scheme is the summation of the rates of the first and second parallel paths ( branches ) from source to destination , which can be expressed as@xcite : @xmath99 the above lp can be re - written as : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 denote the rate of the upper and the lower branches , respectively .",
    "this lp has three unknowns ( @xmath103 ) and six inequalities .",
    "the solution turns three out of six inequalities to equality .",
    "the optimum time interval @xmath104 can not be equal to 0 or 1 , as both solutions give a zero rate .",
    "hence , three out of the first four inequalities should become equality , which leads to the following achievable rates for different channel conditions : @xmath105 in particular , the achievable rate for the _ symmetric _ diamond channel , in which @xmath106 and @xmath107 , is : @xmath108    the optimum time interval @xmath104 is either equal to @xmath109 or @xmath110 defined below :    rl ^*&=\\ {    ll _",
    "1^ * , +   + _ 2^*.    .",
    "note that if @xmath111 , then @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , @xmath113 leads to @xmath114 .",
    "in other words , @xmath115 for @xmath116 makes the maximum amount of data that can be received by relay @xmath30 equal to the maximum amount of data that can be forwarded by relay @xmath30 . in this case ,",
    "branch @xmath30 ( composed of @xmath117 links ) is said to be _",
    "fully utilized_.    it is interesting to consider that the case fully utilizing branch 1 or branch 2 leads to the same data - rate .",
    "this case occurs when one of the following happens : @xmath118 in these situations , one can use either @xmath109 or @xmath110 fraction of the transmission time for forward mode i and the remaining fraction for forward mode ii and achieve the same data - rate .",
    "it will be shown later that the mdf scheme achieves the capacity of the diamond channel if @xmath5 and is at most 1.21 bits less than the capacity for the other two cases .",
    "it is remarked that @xmath5 makes both branches fully utilized and all four rates in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdf_rate ] ) equal .      here",
    ", it is explained that @xmath119 , found by solving the dual - program ( [ eq : dual ] ) , is the same as the mdf rate given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdf_rate ] ) for @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to observe that @xmath120\\ ] ] makes all four rate constraints in the dual - program ( [ eq : dual ] ) equal to the rate obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdf_rate ] ) and satisfies @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the upper bound provided by vector @xmath96 is indeed the capacity of the channel and equals to : @xmath122 the result is valid for the gaussian multiple antenna as well as discrete memoryless channels , and therefore @xmath9 ensures the optimality of the mdf scheme for those channels too .      to investigate how close the mdf scheme performs to the capacity of the diamond channel when @xmath53 , the appropriate upper bounds are required , which will be derived in sections [ sec : mdf - bc ] and [ sec : mdf - mac ] .",
    "therefore , the detailed gap analysis for the mdf scheme is deferred to appendix [ appendix : mdf_gap ] , where it is shown that although a small gap is achievable for some channel conditions , the gap can be large in general . in the following sections , broadcast and multiple - access modes are added to the mdf algorithm to achieve 0.71 bits of the capacity for @xmath7 and @xmath8 cases , respectively .",
    "in the mdf scheme , since both branches can not be fully utilized when @xmath8 simultaneously , there exists some unused capacity in the second hop . to efficiently make use of the available resources , broadcast mode",
    "is added to the mdf scheme .",
    "this mode provides the relays with an additional reception time .",
    "the modified protocol uses broadcast mode together with forward modes i and ii .",
    "therefore , by setting @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ach_gen ] ) the maximum achievable rate of the scheme as a function of the power allocation parameter @xmath65 used in superposition coding is : @xmath124 recall that @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , defined respectively in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u_alpha ] ) and ( [ eq : v_alpha ] ) , are the rates associated with relays 1 and 2 in broadcast mode .",
    "first , the optimal schedule is obtained , assuming a fixed @xmath65 , and later an appropriate value for @xmath65 will be selected .",
    "the achievable rate can be written as the following lp :    ll & r _ + [ eq : bc-1 ]  & r _ t_1(u+v)+t_2c_01+t_3c_02 + [ eq : bc-2]&r _ t_1u+t_2(c_01+c_23)+t_3.0 + [ eq : bc-3]&r _ t_1v+t_2.0+t_3(c_02+c_13 ) + [ eq : bc-4]&r _ t_2c_23+t_3c_13 + [ eq : bc-5]&_i=1 ^ 3 t_i= 1 + [ eq : bc-6]&t_i0 .    for a feasible lp , the solution is at one of the extreme points of the constraint set .",
    "one of the extreme points can be obtained by solving a set of linear equations containing eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc-5 ] ) and inequalities ( [ eq : bc-1])-([eq : bc-3 ] ) considered as equalities .",
    "the solution becomes :    rl [ eq : bc_t1]t_1 & = , + t_2 & = , + t_3 & = , + [ eq : rbc_alpha]r _ ( ) & = .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath5 makes @xmath125 , and hence leads to the mdf algorithm .",
    "note that in addition to inequalities ( [ eq : bc-1])-([eq : bc-3 ] ) , the above extreme point also turns inequality ( [ eq : bc-4 ] ) into equality .",
    "now , this extreme point is proven to be the solution to the above lp . if one of the elements of vector @xmath126 is increased , at least one of the conditions ( [ eq : bc-1])-([eq : bc-3 ] )",
    "provides a smaller rate , compared to the rate obtained by the extreme point .",

    "( [ eq : bc_t1 ] ) is increased , then , because of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc-5 ] ) , at least one of @xmath58 and @xmath59 should be decreased , which in turn reduces the rate associated with the inequality ( [ eq : bc-4 ] ) .",

    "@xcite ) , having non - zero @xmath147 , and @xmath59 in the original lp translates into having the first three inequalities in the dual program satisfied with equality . now looking at the dual problem ( [ eq : dual ] ) with the same structure as the original lp , in order to achieve a smaller objective function , we set @xmath148 or @xmath149 to zero .",
    "this is in contrast to the claim for having both of @xmath58 and @xmath59 non - zero in the original lp with the maximization objective .",
    "therefore , the vector @xmath96 with the following properties is selected :    1 .",
    "either @xmath148 or @xmath149 is zero .",
    "the first three inequalities are satisfied with equality .",
