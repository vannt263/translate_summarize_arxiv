    "radio techniques enable secondary users ( sus ) to access the frequency bands originally licensed to primary users ( pus ) while ensuring that the quality of service ( qos ) of primary transmissions is not affected , which can improve spectral efficiency significantly @xcite .",
    "however , the sus often operate with constrained transmit power to guarantee the qos of pus in terms of interference temperature , thus limiting the throughput and coverage of the secondary system . to combat this problem , cooperative diversity systems involving scattering relay networks",
    "have recently been researched to exploit the spatial diversity gain and to enhance the secondary channel performance @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that cooperative diversity with best - relay selection can achieve the same diversity - multiplexing tradeoff as achieved by the traditional cooperation protocols where all relays are involved in forwarding the signals from source nodes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the conventional one - way relay scheme suffers from a loss in spectral efficiency because of half - duplex transmission @xcite . to circumvent this disadvantage ,",
    "a two - way relay system was proposed in @xcite .",
    "a two - way relay system has two transmission phases . in the first phase , two secondary transceivers ( sts )",
    "simultaneously broadcast their signals .",
    "after successfully receiving the combined signals , the relay node forwards the signals to the two sts in the second phase .",
    "since there are two different relaying paths , the total spectral efficiency of a two - way relay system can be doubled compared with a conventional one - way relay system .",
    "two protocols for two - way relay networks , commonly known as decode - and - forward ( df ) and amplify - and - forward ( af ) relaying , were proposed in @xcite .",
    "based on these , several cooperative diversity schemes for two - way relay networks with best - relay selection have been proposed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "note that all the aforementioned works studied non - cognitive radio networks .",
    "however , in practical cognitive radio systems , pus and sus can simultaneously transmit signals by sharing the same spectrum resources . as a result ,",
    "the relays and secondary receivers inevitably suffer interference from pus . from the viewpoint of sus",
    ", these interferences come in the form of co - channel interference ( cci ) and it is important to analyze their effect on system performance .    so far , the literature that considers power allocation in cognitive two - way relaying networks with cci is relatively scarce . in @xcite , an optimal scheme of power allocation and relay selection for cognitive two - way af relaying networks",
    "was considered .",
    "the cci from the pus is modeled as gaussian noise , which does not characterize the practical cognitive radio communication appropriately .",
    "relay selection and resource allocation in cognitive two - way df relaying network is studied for the first time in @xcite .",
    "however , the cci is considered at primary nodes whereas the interference resulting from primary transmission in secondary receivers is not considered .",
    "moreover , the power allocation schemes in @xcite and @xcite maximize the achievable sum of rate ( sr ) of the secondary transmissions .",
    "the reason for adopting sr is that it is a good measure to characterize the system performance and the corresponding power allocation problem can be easily addressed .",
    "however , the resulting power allocation scheme calls for perfect knowledge of instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) between the nodes in the cognitive network , which could leads to extra computation cost and also is sometimes impossible",
    ". therefore , optimal power allocation for outage probability minimization comes into consideration in such a scenario @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate an adaptive cooperative diversity scheme in cognitive two - way relay networks using the df protocol , where mutual interference between pus and sus is considered .",
    "the sts broadcast their signals both to the relays and to each other through the direct link in the first phase . in the second phase ,",
    "if the relays can decode the signals received in the first phase , the best relay is chosen to forward the signals to the sts ; otherwise , the sts repeat the same transmission to each other through the direct link as in the first phase .",
    "then , the sts combine the two copies of the received signals after the two transmission phases .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows : 1 ) we explore the adaptive use of the direct link and the relay link to pursue higher system performance in cognitive df two - way relaying network .",
    "2 ) for the first time , a power allocation scheme for sts and the relays is developed to minimize the secondary outage probability under a qos constraint from the primary network , which does not require instantaneous csi of the links in the network .",
    "3 ) we provide the optimal relay selection approach for this two - way system in a max - min manner , and an exact closed - form expression for the secondary outage probability is also derived in this paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we give the system description and relay selection scheme in section ii .",
    "section iii addresses the power allocation strategy and the outage performance analysis .",

    "1 . in the primary network , a primary transmitter @xmath0 sends data to a primary destination @xmath1 .",
    "meanwhile , in the secondary relay network , sts @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange information with each other .",
    "secondary relays @xmath4 , are available to assist secondary data transmissions using the df protocol .",
    "we assume that the channel link from @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xmath7 undergoes rayleigh fading with instantaneous coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the channel gain @xmath9 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath10 .",
    "we also assume reciprocity of all the channels and zero - mean additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with variance @xmath11 at each receiver .        in the first phase ,",

    "we adopt the static power allocation scheme to guarantee the qos for primary transmission .",

    "we focus on the adaptive relay cooperation scheme with best relay selection . in the first phase",
    ", some relays may successfully decode the received signals , among which the best relay is chosen to forward the data to sts .",

    "we denote @xmath37 to be the set of all the relays and those relays that are able to successfully decode the received signals constitute a set @xmath38 .    in the second phase ,",
    "if @xmath38 is empty , i.e. , @xmath39 , sts @xmath2 and @xmath3 will repeat the transmission of the original signals to each other through the direct link . in this case , with sic and signal combination using maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) method , the sinr at each st can be respectively expressed as @xmath40 otherwise , if @xmath38 is not empty , where @xmath41 , the best relay @xmath42 chosen within @xmath43 will transmit its decoded data stream to the two sts .",

    "if the relay nodes and the sts can not successfully receive and decode the signals , the secondary transmission is in outage .",
    "our power allocation scheme aims at minimizing the outage probability at every receiver of secondary transmissions between the sts to the relays and the best relay to the sts .",

    "then we will find that all the powers of the nodes in the secondary network approach 0 .",
    "this means that the secondary network is transmitting data with extremely low power in a high noise environment and consequently the outage probability approaches 1 .",
    "we also plot the performance of the secondary network with uniform - power scheme where @xmath229 and @xmath230 , and this uniform power allocation scheme is widely adopted in two - way relay network literatures .",
    "we can see that the proposed power allocation scheme clearly leads to performance improvement compared with the uniform - power scheme , even though the power of relay nodes is both maximized in these two schemes .",
    "another interesting finding is that the proposed power allocation scheme can result in higher relative performance when the secondary network has more relay nodes .",
    "since the proposed scheme is designed to optimize the outage performance and power allocation of @xmath86 and @xmath87 considers all the relay channels , more relay nodes enhance the possibility that the given @xmath86 and @xmath87 can result in lower outage probability .",
    "although we employ high snr with asymptotic analysis as a part of our power allocation scheme , the performance improvement can also be seen in the high noise level regime .",
    "in this paper , we proposed an adaptive cooperative diversity scheme with power allocation and best - relay selection in cognitive two - way relay networks .",
    "the qos of the primary network is given by the primary outage probability , which is guaranteed during the transmissions between the secondary users .",
    "the closed form of secondary outage probability was derived using the decode - and - forward protocol . to better understand the impact of primary interference on the secondary transmissions",
    ", we also investigated the asymptotic behaviors of secondary network when the primary snr goes infinity , including power allocation and outage probability .",
    "we have presented various simulation results to show the validation of the proposed cooperation scheme .",
    "the model and the analysis in this paper also suggest potential topics for future research , which include the resource allocation problem in multi - pair cognitive two - way relay networks with imperfect csi .",
    "the pdf of variable @xmath242 can be expressed as @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 thus , the cumulative distribution function is written as @xmath246 therefore , we can have the pdf as @xmath247 similarly , the pdf of variable @xmath248 can also be addressed as : @xmath249    30 s. haykin , `` cognitive radio : brain - empowered wireless communications , '' _ ieee j. sel .",
