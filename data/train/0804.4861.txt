    "atom - light interaction at the single quantum level plays an important role in many quantum communication and computation protocols .",
    "while spontaneous emission can provide a natural transfer of atomic states into photonic qubits , strong interaction of light with an atom is needed to transfer a photonic qubit into internal atomic degrees of freedom as a stationary qubit .",
    "this process is essential to implement quantum light - matter interfaces @xcite , unless post - selection techniques are used @xcite .",
    "the common approach to achieve this strong interaction pursued for a long time is to use a high finesse cavity around the atom , in which the electrical field strength of a single photon is enhanced by multiple reflections between two highly reflective mirrors , resulting in a high probability of absorption .",
    "another approach to increase the interaction between an atom and a single photon is simply to focus the light field of a single photon down to a diffraction limited area , motivated by the fact that the absorption cross section of an atom is on the order of the square of the optical wavelength .",
    "recent theoretical research on this matter predicts that the absorption probability may reach the maximal value of 100% for dedicated focusing geometries @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the interaction strength between a two - level system and a tightly focused weak coherent light gaussian beam , which is simpler to prepare .",
    "such a system has been theoretically investigated by van enk and kimble @xcite and they concluded that one can expect only a weak interaction .",
    "an experiment on single atom absorption has been carried out a long time ago in the weak focusing regime @xcite , but recent experimental results with single molecules @xcite and atoms @xcite showed an interaction strength which exceeded these theoretical predictions by far . in this paper",
    "we extend the original theoretical model such that it is applicable in the strong focusing regime and provide experimental data on the extinction by a single atom for various focusing parameters . extrapolating from there ,",
    "we find that the interaction strength in between light and an atom can indeed be very strong for realistic focusing geometries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ theory ] , we explain how we quantify the interaction strength between an atom and a weak coherent light field , and set out the basic problem . in section  [ sec : focusfield ] , we calculate the field strength at the focus of an ideal lens by considering a gaussian incident beam for the strong focusing regime . using this ` ideal ' focusing field developed in this section ,",
    "we then obtain an expression for the scattering ratio in section  [ scatt_theory ] , and for the extinction of a focused light beam by a two - level system in various geometries in section  [ sec : extinction ] .",
    "the theoretical prediction is compared with our experimental results in section  [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "the system that we investigate is a single two - level atom localized in free space illuminated by a focused weak monochromatic light field ( probe ) with an incident power @xmath0 .",
    "the interaction strength of the probe with the atom is directly related to the fraction of power scattered by the atom .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to quantify the interaction strength with the ratio of the scattered light power @xmath1 to the total incident power @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath2    the electrical field @xmath3 of a collimated beam with gaussian profile is transformed into a focusing field @xmath4 with a spherical wave front by an ideal thin lens with a focal length @xmath5 , leading to a field amplitude @xmath6 at the location of an atom . ]    to prepare an atom into a clean two - level system , it is convenient to use optical pumping with circularly polarized light - the optical transition therefore will also be driven by circularly polarized light . the light field itself should have a well - defined spatial profile before it is focused onto the atom with a lens .",
    "a circularly polarized , collimated gaussian beam propagating along the @xmath7 axis ( see figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) will therefore be the starting point for our work .",
    "its electrical field strength before the lens is given by @xmath8e^{-\\rho^2/w_\\mathrm{l}^2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the radial distance from the lens axis , @xmath10 the waist of the beam , @xmath11 are the unit vectors in transverse directions , and @xmath12 is the field amplitude .",
    "the beam carries a total power of @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electric permittivity of vacuum , and @xmath15 the speed of light in vacuum . due to the rotational symmetry",
    "the field on the lens axis is always circularly polarized . for an atom that is stationary at the focal point of the lens , the electric field can thus be written as @xmath16\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the amplitude of the field at the focus . in the long wavelength limit",
    "the atom only interacts with the field at the location of the atom . for a field that is resonant with the atomic transition and with an intensity much below saturation ,",
    "the power scattered by a two - level atom is  @xcite ( see  [ app1 ] for more details ) @xmath18 leading to a scattering ratio of @xmath19 which is exact under weak and on - resonant excitation . to evaluate the the scattering ratio @xmath20 and therefore the interaction strength",
    ", one needs to know @xmath21 .    for a weakly focused field where the paraxial approximation holds one finds that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gaussian beam waist at the focus",
    "this leads to @xmath24 with the focusing strength @xmath25 used to fix the focal waist , @xmath26 . with a gaussian focal spot area @xmath27 , the scattering ratio can also be expressed as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the absorption cross section of a two - level system exposed to a resonant plane wave",
    "however , for strongly focused light , the paraxial approximation breaks down , and we need other methods to find @xmath21 .",
    "the paraxial approximation breaks down for strongly focused beams both in the expression of the electric field just behind the lens , and in the propagation of this field to the focus .",
    "an approach to overcome the propagation problem was reported by van enk and kimble in  @xcite .",
    "their lens model , however , applies only to the weak focusing regime . in the following ,",
    "we present a lens model to overcome this limitation and propagate the optical field behind the ideal lens into the focal regime and investigate the focal field using their technique numerically .",
    "we obtain a closed expression for the electrical field in the focus using the green theorem for the propagation .    to simplify the expressions in this section , we express the electrical field in dimensionless units , so the electrical field strength of the collimated gaussian beam entering the focusing lens is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is one of the circular polarization vectors @xmath32 .",
    "an ideal converging lens converts a beam with a plane wave front into one with a spherical wave front which converges towards the focal point @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , it can be modeled as a phase plate modifying an incoming field @xmath34 with a radially dependent phase factor @xmath35 into @xmath36 in paraxial optics , a convenient analytical treatment of gaussian beams can be obtained assuming a parabolic phase factor , @xmath37 this was adopted in @xcite .",
    "however , the conversion of a plane into a spherical wave front corresponds to a phase factor of @xmath38 which is only approximated by equation ( [ parabolic_phase_factor ] ) . on top of this ,",
    "multiplication of a incoming field with such a phase factor leads to an electrical field which is not compatible with maxwell equations , since the polarization vector for @xmath39 is not tangential to the wave front anymore .    in view of this",
    ", we have to change the local polarization with three requirements in mind @xcite : ( i ) a rotationally symmetric lens does not alter the local azimuthal field component , but tilts the local radial polarization component of the incoming field towards the axis ; ( ii ) the polarization at point p ( see figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) after transformation by the lens is orthogonal to the line fp ; ( iii ) the power flowing into and out of an arbitrarily small area on the thin ideal lens is the same .",
    "these requirements determine completely the focusing field right after the lens . with the input field in equation  ( [ input_gaussian_field ] ) ,",
    "one finds ( see  [ app2 ] for details ) @xmath40\\ , ,   \\label{physical_focused_field}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , the factor @xmath42 is needed in order to meet requirement ( iii ) .",
    "the optical field with a converging wave front directly behind the lens needs to be propagated into the focal region to arrive at a field strength of the light interacting with the microscopic system .",
    "various methods can be applied for this purpose .",
    "the one implemented in @xcite projects the focusing field @xmath43 on an orthogonal set of modes @xmath44 , @xmath45 with cylindrical symmetry ( see [ sec : cylmodes ] for details ) .",
    "this decomposition reads @xmath46 where the expansion coefficients @xmath47 are given by @xmath48\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 .",
    "the kronecker symbol @xmath50 reflects conservation of angular momentum under the lens transformation @xcite .",
    "the projection integral has no analytic solution , so the coefficients have to be evaluated numerically .",
    "the ( dimensionless ) field components in the three polarization components @xmath51 at any point behind the lens are superpositions of contributions from different modes , @xmath52 we now evaluate the field components for different regions with this method : first directly behind the lens , then on the optical axes to near the focus , and finally in the focusing plane near the focus .      as a consistency check ,",
    "we first evaluate the field components right after the lens ( i.e. , for @xmath53 ) for a reasonably strong focusing field with @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath55 mm for @xmath56 mm . the relative difference between the reconstructed and original field",
    "is less than @xmath57 , a bound limited by our numerical accuracy .",
    "a linear combination of the field modes @xmath58 in the form of equations ( [ physical_f+ ] ) to ( [ physical_f- ] ) is compatible with the maxwell equations , so since there is no significant difference between the original and reconstructed field , the choice in equation ( [ physical_focused_field ] ) for the focusing field is compatible with maxwell equations even for strong focusing parameters .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : field_comparison ] shows the dimensionless intensity @xmath59 for @xmath56 mm , @xmath60 nm and @xmath61 mm ( @xmath62 ) , with a clearly peaked distribution centered at the focus @xmath63 and a depth of field , defined as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , of about 9.5@xmath58 m .",
    "this result is still very close to the much simpler paraxial approximation of a gaussian beam , with a depth of field of @xmath64 m .    for comparison ,",
    "we show the result for a focusing field using a parabolic phase factor @xmath65 only , following @xcite .",
    "the spherical aberration there displaces and spreads the focus , and significantly reduces the maximal intensity in the focal point @xmath33 .",
    "this problem becomes even more serious for a larger input waist @xmath10 .     along the optical axis for the full focusing field model according to equation ( [ physical_focused_field ] ) , the paraxial gaussian beam model , and for comparison with a parabolic phase factor for the lens only .",

    "@xmath195 0.2 & 0.2449 & 22.99 +    we also carefully characterized the losses of the probe beam in its optical path to ensure that our measured extinctions are not exaggerated by interference artefacts that can happen when certain elements in the transmission path preferentially filter more probe than the scattered light @xcite . from point",
    "a to point b in figure  [ experimental_setup ] we measured 5360% transmission without the atom in the trap .",
    "the losses are mostly determined by 21% loss through the uncoated uhv chamber walls and 1724% loss due to the coupling into the single - mode fiber at the transmission measurement channel .",
    "the coupling loss into the fiber increases as the input waist of the probe beam @xmath10 increases .",
    "almost all losses can be ascribed to reflections at optical surfaces , except for a 916% re - coupling loss into a single mode fiber due to mode mismatch .",
    "we are thus reasonably confident that our measurement is free from artefacts that may arise due to incomplete collection of the probe .     and predicted values for extinction @xmath196 and reflectivity @xmath197 for a coupling into single mode optical fibers .",
    "the inset shows the prediction for much stronger focusing parameters .",
    "[ fig : extinction_th+expt ] ]    in figure  [ fig : extinction_th+expt ] we compare the extinctions obtained from the experiment with values predicted by .",
    "since the probe is recoupled into a single mode fiber for every experimental point using a different lens that matches the probe waist , and the coupling lens has a na=0.55 ( corresponding to @xmath198 ) , we can safely neglect any clipping , and use for estimating the extinction .",
    "obviously the measured extinctions are smaller than those predicted , especially for a larger focusing strength .",
    "we see a few possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "firstly , the lenses we used in the experiment may not be suffciently close to an ideal lens , since they were designed for a situation with an additional window in the focusing part , which we did not have in our experiment .",
    "secondly , the interaction strength is significantly affected by the motion of the atom in the dipole trap . while we do not have an independent measure of the position fluctuation of the atom in the trap , measurements in a similar trap showed a temperature of the atom in the trap of around 100@xmath58k due to the overlapping mot @xcite , slightly below the doppler temperature of 143@xmath58k of rubidium . with our trap frequencies of @xmath199khz in transverse and @xmath200khz in longitudinal direction , this results in position uncertainties of @xmath201 nm and @xmath202 nm , respectively .",
    "the scattering ratio @xmath20 gets reduced due to the presence of the atom in regions with a reduced excitation field , and due to the spatially dependent detuning in the optical dipole trap . in paraxial approximation",
    ", we find an approximate reduction of the scattering rate due to the lower average field of @xmath203 which results in a reduction of 2% for @xmath204 mm to 23% for @xmath205 mm .",
    "the reduction in @xmath20 and therefore in @xmath196 in our regime is about proportional to the temperature , so a doubling of the temperature alone would explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment already . on the other hand , the contribution due to a spatial variation of the resonance frequency is less than 1% .",
    "additionally , the presence of the atom away from the focal point reduces the efficiency of the optical pumping .",
    "however , the observed extinction ratios still exceed the prediction by the parabolic wave front model in @xcite .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : extinction_th+expt ] extrapolates the extinction we could expect for much stronger focusing ; as mentioned earlier , the maximal extinction should reach 92.6% ; whether such lenses can be manufactured , however , remains an open question .",
    "we also depicted the reflectivity of the fiber - atom - fiber system , which should reach values strong enough to be detected in an experimental setup .",
    "extinction and reflectivity do nt match in this configuration , which means that there is still a significant amount of light which is neither transmitted nor reflected back into the optical fiber .",
    "such losses are unavoidable for the described coupling scheme , which still places the fiber - atom - fiber system in disadvantage to a atom - cavity system in terms of success probability of scattering into known modes .",
    "if it would be possible to achieve a better overlap of photonic modes with the dipole transition , such losses should be reduced .",
    "we have demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that a substantial coupling efficiency of a light beam to a single atom can be achieved by focusing a light beam with a lens . by modifying the model given in @xcite ,",
    "we have constructed a focusing field compatible with maxwell equations that is suitable for the strong focusing regime .",
    "high values for the extinction of light ( up to 92% ) by a two - level atom stationary at the focus under the assumptions of weak on - resonant coherent probe are predicted . within the limitations of our current trap ,",
    "our experimental results confirm the possibility of observing a substantial extinction already for relatively weak focusing .",
    "the measured extinction depends on the particular collection configuration of an experimental setup .",
    "it is thus not a fixed quantity for a given incident field . as such ,",
    "the scattering ratio as defined by is a better quantity to characterize the interaction strength between a weak coherent field and an atom in free space , even though it loses a simple physical interpretation in the strong focusing regime .",
    "these results may also be of interest for experiments with single molecules @xcite and quantum dots @xcite .",

    "we briefly repeat the results for light scattered by a two - level atom following @xcite .",
    "the steady - state population @xmath206 of the excited state in a two - level atom exposed to a monochromatic field can be obtained from the optical bloch equations : @xmath207 therein , @xmath208 is the radiative decay rate of the excited state , @xmath209 and @xmath210 is the rabi frequency for a vanishing detuning @xmath211 of the driving field with respect to the atomic transition frequency @xmath212 .",
    "therein , @xmath213 is the electrical dipole moment of the atom .",
    "the optical power scattered by this atom is simply the product of energy splitting , decay rate and population of the excited state : @xmath214 for weak ( @xmath215 ) on resonant ( @xmath216 ) excitation , the scattered power becomes @xmath217 for an excitation field amplitude @xmath6 at the location of the atom .",
    "to obtain the local polarization of the focusing field in  , we consider a point p@xmath218 before the lens and an incident light field with polarization @xmath219 or in the cylindrical basis , @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are two unit vectors along the radial and azimuthal directions respectively .",
    "the ideal lens leaves the azimuthal component unchanged but tilts the radial component such that the local polarization of the field right after the lens is perpendicular to the line fp in figure  [ fig : geometry ] ( f is the focus point ) , that is : @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "for completeness , directly following @xcite , we outline the main properties of the cylindrical modes @xmath226 , which form a complete orthogonal set to compose an electric field that satisfies the source - free maxwell equations , @xmath227\\,,\\ ] ] where the summation over @xmath228 is a short - hand notation for @xmath229 and @xmath230 are arbitrary complex amplitudes .",
    "the modes are characterized by four indices @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the wave vector modulus , @xmath233 the wave vector component in @xmath7-direction , @xmath234 an integer - valued angular momentum index , and @xmath235 the helicity .",
    "the dimensionless mode functions @xmath236 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath237 given in @xcite are @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the transverse part of the wave vector , @xmath32 are the two circular polarization vectors , and @xmath240 with @xmath241 the @xmath234-th order bessel function .",
    "as we are interested in a monochromatic beam with a fixed value of @xmath242 propagating in the positive @xmath7 direction ( @xmath243 ) , the set of mode indices is reduced to @xmath244 where , for convenience , @xmath245 is taken as a mode index instead of @xmath246 .",
    "now , we introduce the notation @xmath247 for a complete summation over all possible modes . for a fixed @xmath248",
    "the modes @xmath44 are orthogonal with respect to the scalar product @xmath249 where @xmath125 is a plane perpendicular to the @xmath7 axis .",
    "this scalar product can thus be used to find the amplitudes of the modes @xmath250 in an arbitrary electric field compatible with the maxwell equations .",
