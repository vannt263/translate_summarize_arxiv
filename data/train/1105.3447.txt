    "experimental observation of nuclear spin dependent ( nsd ) parity non - conservation ( pnc ) is a signature of nuclear anapole moment ( nam ) @xcite .",
    "it is the most dominant nsd - pnc effect among three possible sources .",
    "the other two are : combination of hyperfine and nuclear spin - independent pnc ; and spin - dependent @xmath3 exchange between electrons and nucleus .",
    "to date , the most precise atomic pnc measurement , of atomic cs , has provided the only experimental evidence of nam @xcite . one major hurdle to a clear observation of nuclear anapole moment is the large nuclear spin - independent ( nsi ) signal , which overwhelms the nsd signature . however , proposed experiments with single ba@xmath4 ion @xcite could probe pnc in the @xmath5 transition , where the nsi component is zero .",
    "this could then provide an unambiguous observation of nsd - pnc and nam in particular .",
    "the ongoing experiments with atomic ytterbium @xcite is another possibility , the @xmath6 transition , to observe nsd - pnc with minimal mixture from the nsi component . one crucial input , which is also the source of large uncertainty , to extract the value of nam and nuclear weak charge in nsi - pnc is the input from atomic theory calculations . in the case of isotope chain measurements , like in yb , the pnc observable is a ratio .",
