    "in noncommutative geometry the paradigm of a geometric space is given in spectral terms , by a hilbert space @xmath0 in which both the algebra @xmath1 of coordinates and the inverse line element @xmath2 are represented , the latter being an unbounded self - adjoint operator which plays the role of the dirac operator .",
    "the local geometric invariants such as the riemannian curvature are obtained in the noncommutative case by considering heat kernel expansions of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimension of the geometry .",
    "one may equivalently deal with the corresponding zeta functions .",
    "thus , it is the high frequency behavior of the spectrum of @xmath2 coupled with the action of the algebra @xmath1 in @xmath0 which detects the local curvature of the geometry .    in this paper",
    "we shall analyze in depth a specific example , that of the noncommutative two torus @xmath5 whose differential geometry , as well as its pseudo - differential operator calculus , was first developed in @xcite .",
    "to obtain a curved geometry from the flat one defined in @xcite , one introduces ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) a weyl factor , or dilaton , which changes the metric by modifying the volume form while keeping the same conformal structure .",
    "both notions of volume form and of conformal structure are well understood ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and we recall in  [ sectprel ] how one obtains the modified dirac operator for the new curved geometry .",
    "the starting point is the computation of the value at @xmath6 of the zeta function @xmath7 for the @xmath8-dimensional curved geometry associated to the dilaton @xmath9 .",
    "equivalently we are dealing with the term @xmath10 of the heat expansion .",
    "this computation was initiated in the late 1980 s ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and the explicit result which proves the analogue of the gauss  bonnet formula was published in @xcite .",
    "it was then extended in @xcite to cover the case of arbitrary values of the complex modulus @xmath11 ( which was @xmath12 in @xcite ) . in these two papers only the total integral of the curvature",
    "was needed , and this allowed one to make simplifications under the trace which are no longer possible in the case of arbitrary @xmath13 , i.e.  to compute the local expression @xmath10 .",
    "the technical obstacles for the local computation were overcome by means of    * the general rearrangement lemma of  [ sectrearang ] ; * the assistance of the computer .    while the original computation of @xcite was done by hand ,",
    "the role of the computer assistance is to minimize the danger of a computational mistake in handling the large number of terms , about one thousand , which arise in the generalized pseudo - differential expressions involved in @xmath10 .",
    "the complete calculation of @xmath10 was actually achieved in 2009 and announced ( including by internet posting , although with some typos ) at several conferences ( oberwolfach 2009 and vanderbilt 2011 ) . moreover , the same computation was done independently in @xcite and gave a confirmation of the result .",
    "the main additional input of the present paper consists in obtaining an explicit formula for the ray - singer log - determinant of @xmath14 ( which was left open in @xcite ) . by calculating the gradient of the ray - singer log - determinant in two different ways ,",
    "one obtains new geometric insight as well as a deep internal consistency relation between the different terms of the log - determinant formula . at the same time this elucidates the role of the intricate two operator - variable function occurring in its expression .",
    "we now briefly outline the contents of this paper , starting with the description of the local curvature functionals determined by the value at zero of the zeta functions affiliated with the modular spectral triples describing the curved geometry of noncommutative @xmath8-tori . as in the case of the standard torus viewed as a complex curve , the total laplacian associated to such a spectral triple splits into two components , one @xmath15 on functions and the other @xmath16 on @xmath17-forms , the two operators being isospectral outside zero .",
    "the corresponding curvature formulas involve second order ( outer ) derivatives of the weyl factor , and as a new and crucial ingredient they involve the modular operator @xmath18 of the non - tracial weight @xmath19 associated to the dilaton @xmath9 . for @xmath15",
    "the result is of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inner derivation implemented by @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 is the dirichlet quadratic form @xmath25 and @xmath26 , signifies that @xmath27 is acting on the @xmath28th factor . the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 are new ingredients , whose occurrence is a vivid manifestation of the genuinely non - unimodular nature of the conformal geometry of the noncommutative @xmath8-torus .",
    "the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 by which the modular derivatives act seem at first of a rather formidable nature , and of course beg for a conceptual understanding .",
    "their expressions , arising from the computation , are as follows : @xmath33 @xmath34 one of our new results consists in giving an abstract proof of a functional relation between the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "more precisely , denoting @xmath37 we establish by an a priori argument the identity @xmath38 the function @xmath39 is ( up to the factor @xmath40 ) the generating function of the bernoulli numbers ,",
    "i.e.  one has @xmath41 another main result consists in obtaining the following closed formula for the ray - singer determinant : @xmath42 the a priori proof of the functional relation is based on the computation of the gradient of the ray - singer determinant in two different ways . using the left hand side of one obtains a formula involving @xmath43 , while using the right hand side of gives a general expression as shown in theorem [ directgrad ] of  [ functrel ] .    as a third fundamental result of this paper ,",
    "we establish the analogue of the classical result which asserts that in every conformal class the maximum value of the determinant of the laplacian for metrics of a fixed area is uniquely attained at the constant curvature metric .",
    "this is the content of theorem [ thmmain3 ] , whose proof relies on the positivity of the function @xmath39 .",
    "by , @xmath39 is a generating function for bernoulli numbers , known to play a prominent role in the theory of characteristic classes of deformations , where it is used as a formal power series .",
    "it is quite striking that in the present context of a conformal ( but not formal ) deformation , @xmath39 appears no longer merely as a formal series but as an actual function , whose _ positivity",
    "_ plays a key role .    in marked contrast to the ordinary torus , for which @xmath44 and @xmath45 are both constant multiples of the scalar ( or gaussian ) curvature , the local curvature expressions associated to the zeta functions of the two partial laplacians differ substantially . the function @xmath46 of two variables involved in the expression of @xmath45",
    "is related to @xmath47 in a simple fashion , but a new term appears , in the form of an operator @xmath48 applied to the skew quadratic form @xmath49 a fully conceptual understanding of the meaning of this term remains yet to be found .",
    "being isospectral outside zero , both partial laplacians have the same ray - singer determinant .",
    "this gives rise to a single log - determinant functional , which represents in fact the analytic torsion of the underlying conformal structure .",
    "its gradient delivers in turn the appropriate analogue of the notion of scalar curvature .",
    "moreover , the corresponding evolution equation for the metric yields the natural analogue of ricci flow . it should be mentioned that a different version of the latter has been proposed , albeit not explicitly computed , in @xcite .",
    "we thank farzad fathizadeh and masoud khalkhali for performing independently , cf .",
    "@xcite , the central computation of this paper .",
    "the preliminary material gathered in this section is essentially borrowed from @xcite in order to provide the necessary background for the present paper .",
    "it also serves as a first illustration of the distinctly non - unimodular feature of the conformal geometry of noncommutative @xmath8-tori , which in particular validates the treatment of twisted spectral triples  @xcite as basic geometric structures .",
    "the modular spectral triples considered below can be understood as special cases of the following general construction .",
    "let us start from an ordinary spectral triple @xmath50 which we assume to be even ( and we let @xmath51 be the grading operator ) . using the direct sum decomposition @xmath52 the action of the algebra @xmath1 , the grading operator and the operator @xmath2 take the form @xmath53 were @xmath54 is an unbounded operator from its domain in @xmath55 to @xmath56 and @xmath57 is its adjoint .",
    "let now @xmath58 be a positive invertible element .",
    "since the commutator @xmath59 $ ] is bounded the multiplication by @xmath60 preserves the domain of @xmath54 and the following operator is self - adjoint @xmath61 we use the notion of modular ( or twisted ) spectral triple in the sense of definition 3.1 of @xcite .",
