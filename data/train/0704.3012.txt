    "the possibility that clusters of galaxies might produce gravitational lensing had been considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "twenty years ago @xcite and @xcite independently announced the detection of an arc - like structure around the center of abell 370 , but it was @xcite who explained the phenomenon in terms of gravitational lensing .",
    "currently , the strong and weak regimes of the gravitational lensing effect are often used for constraining the density profiles of galaxy clusters .",
    "the massive clusters of galaxies have a surface density larger than the critical value for strong lensing , approximately 1.0 g @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "they can produce multiple , strongly elongated images ( giants arcs ) of background galaxies lying on top of the caustic lines generated by the cluster potential .",
    "observationally , the first dedicated search for gravitational arcs in x - ray clusters was performed by @xcite using the _",
    "einstein observatory _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) .",
    "a subsequent search was performed by @xcite , which allowed to confirm the relationship between x - ray luminosities and cluster masses ; these authors found strong lensing in eight of 38 clusters .",
    "a subsequent survey based on optically selected clusters in the las campanas distant cluster survey confirmed these giant - arc fractions @xcite and @xcite reports even larger fractions in the red - sequence cluster survey , showing that giant arcs are quite common in clusters of galaxies .    since the shapes of these arcs are related to the gravitational potential , the strong lensing offers a method to investigate how the barionic and dark matters are distributed in the inner regions of the cluster .",
    "also it is possible to put significant constraints on the cosmological parameters using a set of strong lensing clusters showing multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts @xcite .",
    "mass distributions have been modeled for many clusters with giants arcs . in a few cases , accurate models for the mass distribution",
    "have led to the identification of additional counter - image candidates @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "the detection of the predicted images is uncertain , since they are lost in the cd light distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , the gravitational lens cluster a1689 has been modeled in unprecedented detail by @xcite .",
    "these authors combined hst deep advanced camera images and extensive ground based spectroscopy , identifying 32 multiply lensed systems .",
    "the aim of this work is to describe the density profile and the mass distribution of ms2053 , using strong lensing .",
    "this cluster has a redshift of z=0.583 , is not very optically rich in comparison with other z @xmath2 0.5 emss clusters @xcite , and among these high - redshift clusters it has the lowest x - ray luminosity .",
    "bepposax observations yield a x - ray luminosity @xmath3(2 - 10 kev ) = ( 3.9@xmath41.0)@xmath5 erg s@xmath6@xcite , and chandra @xmath3(0.5 - 2 kev ) = 3.5 @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a gravitationally lensed blue arc in deep images of ms2053 , located @xmath7 in the north direction from the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "the arc is @xmath8 long and breaks into two clumps , labeled a and b. recently , @xcite were able to measure the redshift of image a using keck spectroscopy data and determining the source redshift to be z = 3.146 .",
    "@xcite detected the weak lensing ( wl ) signal induced by this cluster of galaxies from a two - colour mosaic of six hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images .",
    "they fitted a singular isothermal sphere model to the observed azimuthally averaged tangential distorsion and estimated the cluster velocity dispersion @xmath9 km s@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite also fitted the predicted profile from the nfw halo to the observed tangential distorsion of ms2053 , and found a concentration parameter ( see section 3.1 ) in good agreement with the predicted value for a cold dark matter model without cosmological constant .",
    "@xcite combined images from the wide - field hst wfpc2 and extensive spectral data from the keck low resolution imager spectrograph ( lris ) to make a detailed study of the galaxy populations in ms2053 .",
    "they found that the cluster is composed of a main cluster ( ms 2053-a ) and an infalling structure ( ms2053-b ) that are gravitationally bound to each other ; their study also shows that the extended spatial distribution and lack of spectral segregation in ms2053-b is consistent with a scenario in which it is in the initial stages of being accreted by the main cluster .",
    "of the 149 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members , 113 belong to ms2053-a and 36 to ms2053-b . from these",
    "previous researches we present in table  [ tbl-1 ] a compilation of physical quantities relevant to our work .",
    "despite all the research cited above , only @xcite have made an attempt to describe the strong lensing effect for this cluster and it was done when the arc redshift had not been measured yet . assuming a redshift of z=2 for the arc and adopting a singular isothermal sphere , these authors found a velocity dispersion of about 1030 km s@xmath6 , consistent with their wl estimate .",
    "they argue that the mass distribution is elongated in the direction of the arc , which can be very well appreciated in the light distribution , and this elongation is the cause of the high value of their strong lensing mass estimate .",
    "such elongation in the distribution of the cluster members was also reported by @xcite . to assess with precision this mass distribution ,",
    "we present a detailed strong lensing model of the bimodal cluster ms2053 .    in @xmath10[observ ] , we describe the observational data and present our sample of field galaxies . in @xmath10[model ] , we define the model of the lensing cluster , and depict the profiles for both the cluster and the galaxy - scale mass components . in @xmath10[results ] , we present the main results . in @xmath10[discuss ]",
    ", we summarize and discuss our results . finally , in @xmath10[conclus ]",
    ", we present the conclusions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a spatially - flat cosmological model dominated by cold dark matter and a cosmological constant .",
    "we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 and h@xmath13 = 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 . with these cosmological parameters and at the redshift of ms2053 , @xmath14 corresponds to 4.62 @xmath15 kpc .",
    "the hst data have been obtained from the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) .",
    "they consist of two wfpc2 images obtained in both the f814w and the f702w filters ; the total integration time for each filter was 2600 and 2400  s , respectively .",
    "the image reduction was performed using the iraf / stsdass package .",
    "first , a warm - pixel rejection was applied to the images using the iraf task _",
    "warmpix_. the cleaned images were then combined with the task _ crrej _ to remove cosmic - rays hits .",
    "finally , the background was subtracted and the wfpc2 chips were combined using the task _",
    "wmosaic_. in figure  [ fig1 ] we show a @xmath16 field obtained from the final four - chip mosaic frame for the f814w filter ; this is the region used in our analysis of strong lensing .",
    "the magnitudes and geometric parameters of the galaxies were measured using sextractor @xcite . for the arc photometry",
    "we used a different procedure because sextractor often overestimate the sky background ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the arcs are highly distorted .",
    "these two circumstances reduce the precision of automatic photometric measurements .",
    "therefore , we employed polygonal apertures to obtain more accurate measurements .",
    "the vertices of the polygons for each arc were determined using the iraf task _ polymark _ , and the magnitudes inside this apertures were calculated using the iraf task _",
    "polyphot_. hence , we found f814w magnitudes of m@xmath17 and m@xmath18 for arcs a and b respectively , and therefore the total magnitude for the system is @xmath19",
    ". similarly , the f702w magnitudes are m@xmath20 for arc a and m@xmath21 for arc b , contributing to a total magnitude of @xmath22 .",
    "our measurements of the total brightness in these two bands are slightly lower than the values reported by @xcite ( m@xmath23 and m@xmath24 ) .",
    "the small discrepancies probably arise from the different methodologies used to calculate the total magnitudes .",
    "for example , @xcite used a single aperture to measure the magnitude for the system of arcs as a whole ( arc ab ) , while we used two apertures to measure each arc independently .",
    "we also calculated the f702w - f814w color for the ab arc system .",
    "the color for arcs a ( @xmath25 ) and b ( @xmath26 ) , are similar within the errors , and the color for the whole ab system , @xmath27 , is similar to the value of 0.37 reported by @xcite .    the general properties of the cluster members are presented in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we used the relative positions for the individual galaxies provided by @xcite to calculate the coordinates of each member of the cluster .",
    "column ( 1 ) lists the identification for each ms2053 galaxy .",
    "columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) list the right ascension and declination . column ( 4 ) , the f814w magnitudes . columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) show the geometric parameters derived from sextractor : ellipticity @xmath28 and the position angle @xmath29 , which gives the orientation of the semi - major - axis from the horizontal line in the image , measured counter - clockwise .",
    "column ( 7 ) lists the redshifts . finally , columns ( 8) and ( 9 ) list the values and the references for the central velocity dispersions .",
    "the upper limits were taken from @xcite ( see their figure 11 ) , who consider only galaxies brighter than m@xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "for studying the mass distribution in ms2053 , we use standard lens modeling techniques implemented in the lenstool ray - tracing code @xcite .",
    "we model the cluster with a nfw profile that has been predicted in cosmological n - body simulations @xcite :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a characteristic density contrast , @xmath34 is the critical density of the universe as a function of the redshift @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is a scale radius that corresponds to the region where the logarithmic slope of the density equals the isothermal value .",
    "however , higher - resolution simulations have suggested that the inner cusp of the nfw profiles is too shallow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , giving origin to the generalized nfw - type profile .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite studied ms 2137 - 2353 , obtaining similar results by using both profiles for the strong lensing regime .",
    "therefore , for simplicity we adopt a profile similar to the original nfw . however , we consider an elliptical profile since in modeling the gravitational lens it is important to take into account the asphericity in the cluster potential .",
    "to generalize the spherical model to an ellipsoidal one , we used the `` pseudo - elliptical '' nfw proposed by @xcite .",
    "this potential is characterized by six parameters : the position @xmath37 ; the ellipticity @xmath28 ; the position angle @xmath38 ; @xmath36 and the velocity dispersion @xmath39 .",
    "we define @xmath39 as :    @xmath40    this is approximately half of the value proposed by @xcite and it is defined in such a way that it represents a realistic velocity dispersion at radius @xmath36 and not only a scaling parameter ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we can relate this @xmath39 to the virial mass @xmath41 and the virial radius @xmath42 of the cluster .",
    "if we define @xmath42 as the radius of a spherical volume within which the mean density is @xmath43 times the critical density at the given redshift @xmath35 ( @xmath44 ) , then the virial radius can be expressed by :    @xmath45^{1/3}\\ ] ]    the value of the characteristic overdensity @xmath43 is taken from the solution to the collapse of a spherical top - hat model .",
    "its value depends on @xmath46 and can be approximated by @xmath47 when @xmath48 @xcite . integrating equation [ eq : rho ] and using the above definition , it is straightforward to show that the ratio between virial and scale radii , which is commonly called the concentration , @xmath49 , is related to @xmath33 by    @xmath50 } \\ ] ]    solving equation [ eq : delta ] , we can determine the concentration value given the @xmath35 , @xmath39 and @xmath36 .      for simplicity , we modeled the 23 galaxies using elliptical singular isothermal spheres ( esiss ) for the individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "this galaxy - scale mass components were included as perturbation into the cluster potential .",
    "the potential for esiss is given by + @xmath51    where @xmath52 corresponds exactly to the true 3d velocity dispersion and @xmath53 is the position angle .",
    "note that equation [ eq : varphi ] is defined completely if we can obtain the values for @xmath52 , the ellipticity @xmath28 , and @xmath53 from observational data .",
    "the luminosity distribution of a given galaxy does not trace the dark mass distribution in its halo , however there is evidence that the projected mass and light distributions tend to be aligned @xcite .",
    "@xcite report this alignment between light and mass for a sample of early - type lens galaxies , for which the isophotal and isodensity countour trace each other .",
    "these authors also report an alignment between the stellar component and the singular isothermal ellipsoids used in their lens models . following these authors",
    ", we infer the parameters of the galaxy - scale mass components from the position , the ellipticity and the position angle of the luminous component .",
    "@xcite have measured the velocity dispersions of several elliptical and lenticular galaxies in the cluster , and @xcite have estimated the internal velocity dispersion for the whole cluster sample with m@xmath30 @xmath54 .",
    "nevertheless , the individual data for each galaxy has not been published for all the objects . to minimize the number of model free parameters , the galaxies for which the velocity dispersion is not available ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) are scaled as a function of luminosity following the faber - jackson relation @xcite :    @xmath55    which transformed to magnitudes",
    "is expressed by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a scaling factor . in this way",
    "the cluster members are incorporated into the model as a galaxy scale perturbation with all their individual parameters fixed .      in principle , the optimizations in the source plane and in the image plane are mathematically equivalent . however , we chose using the source plane because the solutions are numerically simpler and faster to compute .",
    "the fit of the model is optimized by mapping the positions of the multiple images back to the source plane and requiring them to have a minimal scatter .",
    "to achieve this goal we use a figure - of - merit - function , @xmath58 , to quantify the goodness of the fit for each trial of the lens model i.e. , a function that measures the agreement between our data and the fitting model for a particular choice of the parameters :    @xmath59    the first term is constructed as follows : given a model , we compute the position in the source plane @xmath60 for each observed image ( @xmath61 ) , using the lens equation , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the lens potential .",
    "therefore , the barycenter @xmath64 is constructed from the n sources , and the @xmath58 for the position is defined by :    @xmath65    were @xmath66 is the error in determining the position of the source .    the second term , @xmath67 , measures how well the shape of the arcs is reproduced by the model . given a model",
    ", we compute the complex deformation , @xmath68 , for each observed image ( @xmath69),using _ the lens equation for complex deformation _ .",
    "the complex deformation of the image represents how much the intrinsic source shape changes due to the induced deformation caused by the potential .",
    "this complex deformation is function of the ellipticity , the position angle and the lens potential , @xmath70 .",
    "it has an equivalent form in the source plane , @xmath71 .",
    "if we define @xmath72 and @xmath73 as the components of the complex deformation in the source plane , and @xmath74 as the error in determining the shape of the source , we get :    @xmath75    the errors , @xmath66 and @xmath74 , have to be measured in the source plane , but these are not directly observable quantities . to avoid this problem , we assumed that the errors in the source plane arise from the measurements performed in the image plane .",
    "thus , we arbitrarily set @xmath66 and @xmath74 to @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively , because these are the accuracies achieved in the position and shape measurements from the hst images .",
    "this is qualitatively correct in the sense that for poor models , the merit function ( equation [ eq : chi2 ] ) gives large values and thus indicates a poor fit .    in the 6.2 version of lenstool",
    "the bayesian markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package bayesis has been implemented .",
    "the bayesian mcmc method will be described in a dedicated forthcoming publication ( jullo et al .",
    "2007 , in prep . )",
    "this package allows to obtain the errors and to avoid local @xmath58 minima . according to a user defined model parameter space ,",
    "the mcmc sampler draws random models and compute their @xmath58 .",
    "progressively , it converges to the most likely parameter space and outputs the best solution .",
    "we used these random models to perform the statistics to compute error bars on the estimation of the parameters , and to constrain the positions of the bimodal cluster ( see next section ) .",
    "the only arc for which the redshift has been measured is arc a @xcite . the first step was to demonstrate that arcs a and b belong to the same source . but a model that includes only arc a and not arc b is unconstrained , and the data available is not adequate to break the degeneracy . given the general characteristics of the cluster , and a gravitational lensed source with the properties inferred from arc a ( i.e. , redshift and arc position ) , we investigate if this source would produce multiple images or not .",
    "to achieve this task , we constructed a simple spherical model with a nfw profile and its central 23 galaxies modeled like elliptical isothermal spheres .    using equation [ eq : delta ] we calculated the virial radius of the cluster . for a virial mass of @xmath78m@xmath79 and a cluster redshift of z=0.583 ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , @xmath42 @xmath80 mpc",
    "therefore , @xmath36 @xmath81 mpc with a concentration parameter @xmath82=2.9 ( according to the prescription described in section 3.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the characteristic velocity , @xmath39 = 1600 km s@xmath6 , is obtained from equation [ eq : sigma ] . with these values ( @xmath36 and @xmath39 ) ,",
    "the nfw profile is fully characterized . at this stage ,",
    "the ellipticity and the position angle are set to zero .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the galaxy - scale mass components was fixed using the scaling relation given by equation [ eq : k ] .",
    "we found that the early - type cluster galaxies in the sample of @xcite satisfy the faber - jackson relation with @xmath83 .",
    "for the remaining subset of galaxies not included in the @xcite sample , only galaxy @xmath84 has a measured @xmath85 value .",
    "we supposed that these galaxies also satisfy the relation but with a different scaling factor @xmath86 . in order to construct the new correlation , we considered the luminosity @xmath87 corresponding to the faintest galaxy in table  [ tbl-2 ] ( galaxy @xmath88 , m@xmath89 ) .",
    "we set @xmath90 km s@xmath6 such that the galaxy @xmath84 satisfies this correlation . with these values , the velocity dispersion in the subset of galaxies not included in the @xcite sample is expressed by @xmath91 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] show both , the previous @xmath92 and the faber - jackson relations for the early - type galaxies of @xcite .    with all these parameters we calculate the counter - images of arc a.",
    "the model obtained with these fixed parameters predicts two more images , one very demagnified and the other only one magnitude bellow the arc a ; the position does not agree with b , but this shows that for this cluster characteristics and with this redshift of the source , a would have multiple counter - images .",
    "therefore , is entirely plausible that images a and b arise from the same source .",
    "two kinds of models are possible depending on whether we assume that ms2053 is composed of one or two clusters , as reported by @xcite .",
    "we performed the fits setting up the position ( two parameters ) , the velocity , scale radius , ellipticity , and the position angle of the cluster as free parameters .",
    "these 6 parameters define the lens potential and they comprise all the allowed free parameters for this single cluster case . with just 2 images and 4 constrains ( if there is a total of @xmath93 images , then there are @xmath94 constrains on the models assuming that the position , ellipticity , and position angle of the images are fitted ) the model is underconstrained . and it gets worse in the second model where we have 12 parameters defining the lens potential . therefore , we expect that there may be a family of models that can fit the data , even with unrealistic parameters . trying to avoid this problem ,",
    "we have limited one parameter in the nfw , the scale radius @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath36 cut - off was made in the following way : given the cluster redshift and using equation [ eq : rdelta ] , we can write the scale radius as @xmath95 , being @xmath96 the mass found from lensing .",
    "since lensing is sensitive to the integrated mass along the line of sight , we expect discrepancies between the true 3d mass , @xmath97 , and the lensing mass estimates of our models , @xmath98 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider an axisymmetric nfw density profile with either the major or the minor axis aligned toward the line of sight .",
    "therefore , the net effect of the projection is given by @xmath99 ; where @xmath100 is the ratio between the semiaxis aligned and the semiaxis perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "thus , we can write :    @xmath101    using the concentrations shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] and the axis values from @xcite we can constrain the scale radius for each model . for the one component model , 0.60 mpc @xmath102 1.74 mpc . similarly for the two component model 0.30 mpc @xmath102 0.87 mpc and 0.10 mpc @xmath102 0.28 mpc for component one and two respectively . +",
    "we constructed three models for the gravitational lens system .",
    "the first model , which is unconstrained , consists of a _ single _ cluster and data from arcs a and b to make the fit .",
    "our best fit for the single component model predicts a third image which is slightly demagnified ( m@xmath103 ) in a position where no object is detected in the hst exposures .",
    "we explored the field near its predicted position and identified an object around @xmath104 to the north ( @xmath105 ) which seems to be a deformed image of a galaxy .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the isocontour map superimposed onto the optical image of this blurry object .",
    "we measured the magnitude of this counter - image candidate ( m@xmath106 ) , and we found that it is similar to the magnitude predicted by our model .",
    "moreover , its f702w - f814w color turns out to be analogous to arc a , @xmath107 , ( see discussion below ) .    in the second model",
    ", we repeated the previous fit but including the third image candidate . with this third image the model",
    "is well constrained because we have 8 constrictions and only 6 parameters .",
    "the fit was very accurate for the position but the total @xmath58 is affected by the shape .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in this well constrained model , there are two different solutions in the xy - space . in figure  [ fig4 ] we show the xy parameter space for this lens model constructed from all the trials coming out from the mcmc optimization procedure .",
    "we think that this result is due to the fact that the lens is a double cluster ; we used the regions defined by these clumps to construct a third model , the _",
    "double _ component model , that accounts for a bimodal distribution of mass .",
    "the results of these fits are summarized in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "column 1 identifies the model : single for models with one component and double for the model with two components ; ab and abc indicate that the model consists of arcs a and b , or these two arcs plus the third image c. columns 2 and 3 show the position in arcseconds relative to the bcg .",
    "columns 4 - 8 list the parameters associated to nfw profile , ellipticity , position angle , concentration , scale radius and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "column 9 and column 10 show the @xmath58 for the image positions only and for the whole fit , respectively .      for the purpose of quantifying the mass distribution , we traced a projected mass map from the best - fit model , double abc ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the corresponding isocontour map superimposed onto the f814w image of ms2053 . by integrating this two dimensional map",
    ", we can get the total mass of the cluster .",
    "in other words , we can determine the mass , making an azimuthal average of its mass in circles around the bcg .    in the figure  [ fig7 ] we compare the projected mass as a function of radius for the three components of the cluster : the two clusters ( _ component 1 _ and _ component 2 _ ) and the individual galaxies . to calculate the contribution of the individual galaxies ,",
    "we extrapolate the masses of the individual cluster components to their virial radii and add them .",
    "we can appreciate that within the central 0.8mpc , the dominant component corresponds to the mass of the galaxies .",
    "however , at the arc radius ( r @xmath108mpc ) the _ component 1 _ has the main contribution to the lens mass .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] also show the total mass of the cluster as the sum of these three components .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the sum of the projected mass of _ component 1 _ and _ component 2 _ ( without including the galaxies ) as a function of radius .",
    "we have extrapolated the nfw profiles up to 1 mpc in order to compare with the virial mass estimate by @xcite , and with a @xmath109 model derived by @xcite .",
    "the vertical line shows the distance of arc a with respect to the bcg , and it indicates the limit below which the mass estimate from strong lensing is reliable .",
    "the mass determined using x - ray data depends on assumptions involving spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , ms2053 shows evidence of being two clusters enduring a merger process @xcite , and therefore it is not expected to find a good agreement between the @xmath109 model and the strong lensing mass profile ( see  [ discuss ] ) .",
    "we found that the colors for the abc arc system turned out to be virtually the same , with arc b slightly bluer but still coinciding with the color of arc a and image c within the errors .",
    "this result supports the assumption that images a , b and c belong to the same source . despite this fact a serious concern ,",
    "is the lack of specularity ; arcs a and b should be mirror images of each other , for which there is no evidence in the hst image .",
    "however , this would not be the first case of lack of specularity .",
    "for example , the cluster a383 shows a giant tangential arc with substructures and with no evidence of being formed by two mirror images ; these substructures have different colors @xcite and lie at the same redshift , @xmath110 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that these arc features can be understood in terms of just one galaxy positioned over the tangential and radial caustic lines simultaneously , with three different portions of the same galaxy producing the arc substructure .",
    "we think that something similar may be occurring in ms2053 , that is the proximity of the source to the caustic line ( see figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the color distribution in galaxies often changes at different optical radii ( e.g. , bulge , disk and halo populations ) . in the case of a spiral galaxy for which the disk ( but not the bulge ) is located over a caustic line",
    ", part of the disk is mapped onto a stretched arc such as arc b. this effect may explain the slight difference , if any , for the arc b color , the difference in shape between arcs a and b , and the lack of specularity between the arcs .",
    "for the rest of this section we will assume that the three images a , b , and c correspond to the same source .",
    "this assumption , along with the evidence presented in the following lines , in the sense that the quality of the fits is better for the model with two cluster components , justifies that our discussion shall be focused on our model 3 .",
    "the @xmath58 for the whole fit is @xmath111 for the doubleabc model and @xmath112 for the other two , favoring the bimodal model ( cf .",
    "@xmath113 values in table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "in addition the @xmath39 values , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 for _ component1 _ and _ component2 _ respectively , agree within the errors with the values reported by @xcite ; but the other models yield larger velocities ( _ c.f . _ tables  [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the mass distribution in ms2053 is elongated in the direction of the giant arc ; this projected spatial distribution of the cluster was confirmed by @xcite and it was attributed to a real elongation in the spreading of cluster members .",
    "the critical lines for our model , shown in figure  [ fig9 ] , reveal that the main component of the double cluster has a position angle of @xmath116 , and supports the existence of a mass elongation .",
    "in addition , the mass map as well as the isocontour map of the projected mass distribution ( see figure  [ fig5 ] and figure  [ fig6 ] ) reflect ms2053 s elongated distribution .",
    "the offset in the position of the cluster components with respect to the bcg ( see table  [ tbl-3 ] ) also confirms the cluster asymmetry .",
    "similar offsets have been found by other authors for different clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the effects can reach values up to 120 kpc in unrelaxed clusters @xcite .    several researches have reported large concentration values by fitting nfw profiles to clusters of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these results were obtained assuming spherically symmetric mass distributions , although the cdm model predicts triaxial halos as consequence of the collisionless dark matter @xcite .",
    "using n - body simulations , @xcite argue that the halo triaxiality affects the concentration parameter measurements obtained through gravitational lensing .",
    "@xcite concludes that a prolate halo aligned toward the line of sight is a natural explanation for the high concentration found in ms 2137 - 2353 ; but he also leaves open the possibility that the lensing mass estimates can be subestimated .",
    "@xcite also investigated the importance of the halo triaxiality and demonstrated that this could cause a significant bias in estimating the virial mass and concentration parameter from the lensing information .",
    "in contrast , the concentration parameters obtained either for the single or for the double component clusters may be slightly lower ( _ _ c.f.__tables  [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-3 ] ) , although they agree , within the errors , with the expected values . following @xcite ,",
    "a halo with axis ratio @xmath117 1 could explain the possible small discrepancies between our model and those inferred by @xcite and @xcite ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) for a cluster with @xmath120 m@xmath121 and @xmath122 m@xmath121 in a @xmath123-dominated universe .    a lower concentration changes the mass estimate . at large radii",
    ", the effect tends to vanish and the weak lensing and true masses are the same ( see figure  [ fig8 ] ) , but inside the arcs ( r @xmath124mpc ) the effect is not negligible producing an overestimate with respect to its actual x - ray mass .",
    "but the differences in the masses can also be explained as a result of the merging process .",
    "@xcite studied a set of five galaxy clusters resolved at high resolution in a hydrodynamic simulation , examining the systematics affecting the x - ray mass estimates .",
    "they showed that for a cluster undergoing a merger , the assumption of hydro - dynamical equilibrium led to the underestimation of mass by 20@xmath125 , and that a @xmath109 model gave even more discrepant results with typical deviations of about 40@xmath125 . in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we compare the strong lensing mass profile to the x - ray mass profile corrected for the 40@xmath125 underestimation ; we can see that with this correction , the x - ray mass estimate agrees with the mass obtained from the nfw components at the positions of the arcs , but for smaller radii the x - ray mass is significantly lower .",
    "it is important to notice that we did not have included the masses of the individual cluster components , and thus we are not considering in figure  [ fig8 ] the total mass within the arcs .",
    "in addition , the extrapolation of the nfw mass inferred from gravitational lensing up to 1mpc from the bcg , well beyond the distance of the arcs , is a factor @xmath126 lower than the mass shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] obtained by @xcite .",
    "nfw ellipsoids have been successfully used for strong lensing modelling in galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the non - linearity of the gravitational lensing effect , as well as its high dependence on the core densities , the asymmetries of the mass distribution , and the cluster neighborhoods , put limits to the use of analytical solutions in the case of non relaxed systems , such as ms  2053 . in this sense",
    ", the work of @xcite , who have computed the strong lensing effect in a merging cluster with complex and irregular mass distribution , have shown that the lensing cross - sections can grow by one order of magnitude and that during the merger , the shape of the critical and caustics lines changes substantially .",
    "these topics have been discussed in a recent paper by @xcite , who propose a fast method to calculate cross sections for complex and asymmetric mass distributions .",
    "we have modeled the mass distribution of the cluster ms2053 using the lenstool ray - tracing code developed by @xcite .",
    "the fits were performed considering both a single and a double nfw profiles , and 23 galaxy - scale mass components as perturbations to the cluster potential .",
    "we used esiss for the individual galaxies and set constraints to their parameters using observational data .",
    "we measured the arc positions and shapes , and the galaxies positions using the hst archive image , and calculated the nfw parameters for the single and double galaxy cluster models .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the xy parameter space of the single abc model has a bimodal distribution that strongly suggests a double cluster undergoing a merger process .",
    "the quality of the fits also favor a model with a bimodal mass distribution 2 .",
    "the models consistently predict a third slightly demagnified counter - image for the ab arc system .",
    "3 .   we found a candidate for this counter - image near the predicted position .",
    "this candidate shows a fuzzy object that can be the image of a distorted galaxy due to the effect of gravitational lensing . besides , it has the same f702w - f814w colors as arcs a and b. 4 .   using the strong lensing effect",
    "we confirm the asymmetry and the elongation in the mass distribution of ms2053 reported by other authors @xcite , and we estimate the total lensing mass within the arcs to be @xmath127 m@xmath128 .",
    "we find a significant discrepancy between the mass estimates from lensing and x - ray measurements , that we attribute to the fact that the cluster is not in hydro - dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the concentration parameters obtained either for the single or for the double component clusters may be slightly lower than the expected values .",
    "these possible small discrepancies can be explained by asymmetries in the mass distribution and the projection effects .",
    "much more work is necessary in order to understand ms2053 mass distribution .",
    "future spectroscopic follow - up of arcs b and c will provide a test of our model . also , an extensive study of the internal velocity dispersion of the cluster members can be used to further improve the accuracy of the mass reconstruction .",
