    "emerging various widespread human diseases speeds up the growing rate of genomics .",
    "accordingly , analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) sequences , as a medium storing by far more important information about properties of an organism , has intrigued many researchers to extract significant knowledge about life sciences @xcite . as a common event in evolution process",
    ", mutation would modify dna data sequences comprising of a finite number of basic elements known as nucleotides , i.e. , adenine ( a ) , cytosine ( c ) , guanine ( g ) , and thymine ( t ) , which are independent of each other .",
    "since each sequence data conceals in a collection of one - dimensional ( 1d ) strings forming a genome , the role of string data alignment or pattern matching against a sequence of genomes is much more critical for comparison and interpretation of dna - based structures @xcite . due to rapidly evolving dna - sequencing , investigating through highly extensive dna databases to identify occurrence of exchange , deletion , and insertion of specific data , find target dna strings or newly genes and classify species is becoming a costly and challenging problem for researchers @xcite .",
    "all recent sequencing technologies , including roche/454 , illumina , solid and helicos , are able to produce data of the order of giga base - pairs ( gbp ) per machine day @xcite . however , with the emergence of such enormous quantities of data , even the fast digital electronic devices are not effective enough to align capillary reads @xcite .",
    "actually , today s electronics technology would not permit us to achieve high rate of analysis in sequence matching and information processing due to the time consuming nature of serial processing @xcite . to keep pace with the throughput of sequencing technologies ,",
    "many new alignment algorithms have been developed , but demands for faster alignment approaches still exist .",
    "as a result , the necessity of finding a novel implementation to provide high performance computational systems is undeniable @xcite .",
    "high data throughput , inherent parallelism , broad bandwidth and less - precise adjustment of optical computing provide highly efficient devices which can process information with high speed and low energy consumption .",
    "it is worth mentioning that visible light in optical computing systems realizes information visualization for human operators to more effectively carry out genome analysis . employing a powerful technique to encode dna information into an optical image besides optical computing capabilities would definitely guarantee to efficaciously",
    "perform genomes analysis @xcite .",
    "while recent implementations were static and relying on printed transparent sheets @xcite , herein , we theoretically and experimentally present dynamic string data alignment based on a spatially coded moir technique @xcite implemented on spatial light modulators ( slms ) which enables one to investigate useful hiding information in genomes .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the principle of string data matching using the spatially coded technique is explained . in section",
    "iii , bar and circular patterns as an effective scheme for string data alignment will be discussed . in section iv",
    ", the experimental optical architecture and obtained results will be appeared to verify practical feasibility of our proposed pattern , and section v concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , the principles of string alignment by moir technique are outlined .",
    "consider two data sequences .",
    "the goal of string alignment is evaluation of similarities and differences between them .",
    "in particular , we are interested in distinguishing insertion and deletion of elements in any strings with respect to each other .",
    "moir technique applies high speed parallel processing of light to perform string alignment . in this approach ,",
    "four components of strings , namely @xmath0 are encoded as @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "based on this coding , the strings are spatially coded into images where each component corresponds to four narrow stripes with one bright stripe as @xmath2 and three dark stripes as @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ graphical ] ) .",
    "the coded images are then overlapped with a small relative angle , and by using this technique , correlating segments of the second string in various shifts of the first one can evidently be distinguished .",
    "the subsequent matched elements will be appeared as a bright line in the observed pattern of overlapped images .        ,",

    "[ fig1](a ) shows @xmath6 with respect to the codes appeared in fig .",
    "[ graphical ] , and each row in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows subsequent shifts of initial string @xmath7 @xmath8 ; for example first row shows s1(1:20 ) , second row shows s1(2:21 ) , up to the last row .",
    "overlapping fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ans ( b ) results in the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ; the bright line in the fourth row illustrates that a correlation has happened for a shift of 6 , i.e. , s2 and s1(6:25 ) are matched .    .corresponding codes for polarized spatial patterns in figs .",
    "[ type1 ] and [ type2 ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a two - dimensional array of photodetectors can be employed to capture the output pattern ; then digital processing would be done by a host computer to extract precise matching .",
    "alternatively , analyzing the output pattern can be realized by visual inspection or using a ccd camera .    in order to verify our proposed method",
    ", we firstly show bar strings alignment between two dna - simulated sequences ; then the circular one will be demonstrated as our proposed new encoded pattern .",
    "one - dimensional strings to be aligned are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ exp1 ] and [ exp2 ] in which @xmath4 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 were introduced earlier . to more",
    "straightforwardly realize string alignment , a cylindrical lens could be employed between the third polarizer and the output display .",
    "it is well known that such a lens transforms plane wave to an ultra - thin line . as a result ,",
    "each horizontal bright line in the output pattern right behind the lens is mapped to a luminous point on the display which enables us to use a simple one - dimensional array of photodetectors to detect the occurrence of exact matching and the number of deleted or inserted elements .",
    "[ cylindrical](a ) and [ cylindrical](b ) respectively illustrate the transformed versions of the output patterns in figs . [ exp1](f ) and [ exp2](f ) at the focused plane of the cylindrical lens .",
    "additionally , simulated and experimental results for circular patterns presented in fig .",
    "[ circular ] are in good agreement .",
    "in conclusion , a simple and practical method based on spatially coded moir matching technique has been proposed for string alignment processing .",
    "easy interpretation and inherent parallelism with almost real - time processing are the main specifications of our approach which is compatible with digital devices . the processing gain and snr of the proposed patterns ,",
    "i.e. , bar and circular patterns , have numerically been calculated to show the effectiveness of our method . moreover , a preprocessing stage which remarkably decreases post - processing time needed for interpretation of output pattern has been introduced .",
    "the capability of our proposed method in dna sequence matching has been shown via simulation .",
    "finally , experimental results verify the performance of the method in genomics processing applications based on optical computing .",
