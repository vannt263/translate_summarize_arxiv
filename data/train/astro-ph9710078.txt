    "the large - scale structure of the universe forms when matter accretes onto high density perturbations via gravitational instability . among the models that attempt to explain the quantitative features of the large - scale structure , the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model",
    "is based on the assumption that the dominant component of matter is cold .",
    "the model also assumes that the initial fluctuations are adiabatic and random gaussian , and have a zeldovich spectrum , @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the standard cdm ( scdm ) model , which is the simplest and yet the most widely studied , makes the additional assumptions that the total @xmath13 and @xmath14 from the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( walker 1991 ) . here",
    "@xmath15 is the density parameter .",
    "this model had some success , but it is now well known to have difficulties in explaining a number of observations ( see , , ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) . in particular , this model has excessive power on small scales when normalized to the _ cobe _ data on large scales ( see , , bunn , scott & white 1995 ) .",
    "several alternative cosmological models , including the chdm model , have been studied claiming better agreement with observations .",
    "the chdm model is based on the same assumptions as the scdm model , except that in addition to the cdm component , it has also the hot dark matter ( hdm ) component .",
    "hdm is composed of one of the three known species of neutrinos ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) with a mass of @xmath19 . since",
    "neutrino s free streaming erases fluctuations in density on scales from galaxies to clusters during the radiation - dominated era , replacing a portion of cdm with hdm suppresses power on small scales .",
    "therefore , the chdm model has less power on small scales than the scdm model .",
    "this basic property of the chdm model was investigated some time ago ( fang , li & xiang 1984 ; valdarnini & bonometto 1985 ; achilli , occhionero & scaramella 1985 ) .",
    "the fact that the chdm model is promising in explaining the observed data of large - scale structure was first established by several analytic calculations using linear or nonlinear tools ( schaefer , shafi & stecker 1989 ; van dalen & schaefer 1992 ; holtzman & primack 1993 ; pogosyan & starobinsky 1995 ; dodelson , gates & stebbins 1996 ; ma 1996 ; borgani 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "for example , holtzman & primack ( 1993 ) used the peaks formalism for gaussian density fields and found that the correlation function of clusters in the chdm model with @xmath20 is consistent with the correlation function of the abell clusters .",
    "a number of numerical simulations further confirmed the promising aspects of the chdm model ( davis , summers & schlegel 1992 ; klypin 1993 ; jing 1994 ; klypin & rhee 1994 ; nolthenius , klypin & primack 1994 ; jing & fang 1994 ; yepes 1994 ; bryan 1994b ; ghigna 1994 ; bonometto 1995 ; walter & klypin 1996 ; klypin , nolthenius & primack 1997 ; dav 1997 ) .",
    "most of these simulations were carried out for the model with the `` standard '' density ratio @xmath21 .",
    "for example , klypin & rhee ( 1994 ) calculated the correlation function for the abell clusters and the apm clusters and confirmed the results given by holtzman & primack ( 1993 ) .",
    "jing & fang ( 1994 ) calculated the evolution of the mass function , the velocity dispersion function , and the temperature function of clusters and argued that their results favor the chdm model over others .",
    "bryan ( 1994b ) computed the properties of x - ray clusters using a code which can handle the hydrodynamics of baryonic matter .",
    "they showed that the luminosity and temperature distribution functions fit well the available observational data , and @xmath22 is sufficient to explain the x - ray properties in the chdm model with @xmath20 .",
    "klypin ( 1997 ) showed that the chdm model with the `` standard '' density ratio , as well as that with @xmath23 , give good fits to a wide variety of `` present - epoch '' data .",
    "however , the chdm model with @xmath21 has a problem in producing galactic halos at @xmath24 massive enough to account for neutral gas observed in damped ly@xmath25 systems ( mo & miralda - escud 1994 ; kauffmann & charlot 1994 ; ma & bertschinger 1994 ; klypin 1995 ; bi , ge & fang 1995 ) .",
    "so it was suggested that the more promising version of the chdm model should have less mass in the hot component , @xmath26 , in order to have more power on galaxy scales and so produce significantly more high - redshift objects .",
    "ma ( 1996 ) , using an approximation to the evolution of linear power spectrum , argued that the slightly tilted ( @xmath27 ) chdm model with @xmath28 gives a power spectrum that agrees best with the observed power spectrum .",
    "primack ( 1995 ) showed that dividing the neutrino mass between two species of neutrinos ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) lowers the power spectrum on the cluster scale , and thus lowers the cluster abundance without the necessity of tilt @xmath29 of the chdm model .    in this paper",
    ", we constrain @xmath30 in the chdm models with @xmath0 by investigating the properties of x - ray clusters that are sensitive to @xmath30 .",
    "recent satellite x - ray observations made the properties of x - ray clusters increasingly important to cosmology as a probe into the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "being massive and rare , the cluster abundance in the local and distant universe carries vital information on the initial density fluctuations and the matter content of the universe . also being relatively young dynamically ,",
    "the details of their structures provide us with some signatures left over from the formation epoch as well as information on the background cosmology .",
    "the study on the properties of x - ray clusters in model universe has been made analytically ( , kitayama & suto 1996 ) or numerically using grid - based codes ( kang 1994 ; cen & ostriker 1994 ; bryan 1994a ; bryan 1994b ) and the sph code ( , evrard , metzler & navarro 1996 ) .",
    "a general consensus seems to be that the scdm model with @xmath31 normalized to the _ cobe _ measurement of the anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation ( , @xmath32 ) has serious difficulties in explaining the observed properties of x - ray clusters , such as the cluster abundance ( kang 1994 ; bryan 1994a ) , the baryon fraction in clusters ( lubin 1995 ) , and the contribution of cluster emission to the x - ray background ( kang 1994 ; bryan 1994a ; kitayama & suto 1996 ) . on the other hand , a flat cdm model with cosmological constant ( @xmath33cdm ) and a chdm model , both of which have smaller values of @xmath34 ,",
    "seem more consistent with observations ( cen & ostriker 1994 ; bryan 1994b ) . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the present - epoch , linear rms mass fluctuation in the sphere of radius @xmath35 .",
    "we should mention that our work bears many similarities with that of bryan ( 1994b ) .",
    "both consider x - ray clusters in the chdm universe with similar ( but not same ) codes .",
    "however , while bryan ( 1994b ) considered the chdm model with @xmath21 , which was `` standard '' at that time , we considered the models with a smaller @xmath36 ( @xmath23 , see  3.2 ) , which are more acceptable now .    in  2 the details of the numerical simulations are described .",
    "results are presented in  3 .",
    "conclusion follows in  4 .",
    "in order to study the linear power spectrum using analytic approximations in the chdm universe , ma ( 1996 ) considered the models with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the normalization of the power spectrum , @xmath34 , was determined by the _",
    "cobe _ observation ( see  2.2 for details ) .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , ma ( 1996 ) found that the models with @xmath40 and @xmath41 give power spectra that agree well with observation . here ,",
    "we adopt ma s models with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for baryonic",
    "fraction we use the values @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which is in the range predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis @xmath42 ( walker 1991 ; copi , schramm & turner 1995 ) .",
    "the values of the model parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".model parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 4.2 in = 4.2 in    the temperature distribution function , in addition to the luminosity function , of x - ray clusters provides a useful test for the structure formation theory .",
    "it has been calculated at four different redshifts and shown in figures 5a and 5b for chdma and chdmb .",
    "the turnover at low x - ray temperature , @xmath43 , is possibly caused by our definition of minimum cell luminosity to constitute x - ray bright cells .",
    "there are almost no high - temperature clusters with @xmath44 . again",
    ", this is due to the limited volume of our computational domain which is not big enough to contain high - temperature clusters .",
    "the observed temperature distribution function is @xmath45 according to henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) , and shown as the boxed area . in the reliable range of @xmath43 ,",
    "the distribution functions for the both models are almost identical .",
    "this is expected , since @xmath43 is mainly determined by the gravitational potential of _ total _ matter .",
    "both the distribution functions agree well with the observed data .",
    "the relation between the cluster s temperature , @xmath43 , and luminosity , @xmath46 , should be less sensitive to the normalization of power spectrum . in figure 6 , we show the plots of @xmath43 versus @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "the upper panel is for chdma and the lower panel is for chdmb .",
    "the boxed area indicates the observed relation , @xmath48 according to henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) .",
    "the best straight - line fits , @xmath49 , are shown as a dotted line for chdma and solid line for chdmb . @xmath50 and @xmath51 for chdma , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 for chdmb , respectively . for a given luminosity ,",
    "the temperature is somewhat lower for chdmb ( @xmath52 ) than for chdma ( @xmath50 ) , and the slopes ( @xmath51 and @xmath54 ) are somewhat steeper than that indicated by observations ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "however , the observed slope is determined mainly by high - luminosity clusters .",
    "we find that in the region where comparison can be made , the agreement with the observations is better for chdma than chdmb .    for each simulated x - ray cluster ,",
    "the gas mass and the total mass within a sphere of radius @xmath56 are calculated at @xmath47 .",
    "the histogram of the ratio of the two masses is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the thick dotted histogram shows the ratio distribution for chdma , and the thick solid shows the ratio distribution for chdmb .",
    "these histograms are arbitrarily normalized to have a peak height similar to the observation data , which is drawn with the thin solid histogram , adopted from jones & forman ( 1992 ) .",
    "the more recent observed ratio of the gas to total mass is @xmath57 for a refined sample of @xmath58 clusters ( white & fabian 1995 ) , so the observed ratio has gone up a little .",
    "the median of the computed ratio is @xmath59 for chdma and @xmath60 for chdmb .",
    "improving observations will probably narrow the observed histogram , while increasing the dynamical range of numerical simulations and incorporating more realistic physics will widen the computed histograms .",
    "both expected improvements should make the agreement better .",
    "= 2.4 in    figure 8 shows the evolution of the average x - ray temperatures for clusters with @xmath61 from @xmath47 to @xmath62 .",
    "open circles are for chdma and filled circles are for chdmb . also shown are the best - fits to the evolution analytically predicted by kaiser ( 1986 ) , @xmath63 for @xmath13 .",
    "the evolutions for the both model are similar , as expected .",
    "but there is an overall difference that the average temperatures are smaller in chdmb by a factor of @xmath64 than those in chdma .",
    "the computed evolution of the average temperatures agrees only marginally with analytical prediction by kaiser ( 1986 ) .",
    "we have computed the linear power spectrum of total matter for spatially flat , _ cobe_-normalized chdm models .",
    "we have found that the models with @xmath1 and @xmath2 give a power spectrum in good agreement with the observed power spectrum .",
    "then , through numerical simulations that include the hydrodynamics of baryonic matter , as well as the particle dynamics of dark matter , we have computed the properties of x - ray clusters for the models with @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we have found that the models with @xmath65 produce x - ray clusters with properties that agree well with the observed data .",
    "our results have shown that the physical properties of x - ray clusters considered in this paper are quite sensitive to @xmath30 , since the bremsstrahlung emission is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "although the number of x - ray bright clusters in the model with @xmath67 exceeds slightly the observed number , we still consider the model to be marginally consistent with observations .",
    "however , the _ cobe_-normalized chdm model with @xmath10 may be ruled out by the present work .",
    "finally , we note that that our simulations are not fully converged , so x - ray luminosity may have been under - estimated by a factor of @xmath68 or more .",
    "hence , future simulations with higher resolution will put a more stringent constraint on @xmath30 .",
