    "in the 5.5 years duration of the _ spitzer _ @xcite cryogenic mission , the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ? * ) obtained mid - infrared ( mir ) spectra with unprecedented sensitivity for more than one thousand agn @xcite , including quasars , seyferts , liners , radio - galaxies , blazars , etc .",
    "however , the limited spatial resolution of irs observations ( 3.6 `` and 10.5 '' for the short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) modules , respectively ) implies that the extended emission from the host galaxy usually contributes a significant fraction of the flux within the irs aperture . because of the difficulty in disentangling the emission from the agn and its host galaxy , the shape of the agn spectrum at mir wavelenghts usually has large uncertainties , except for some quasar - luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "sub - arcsecond resolution observations with ground - based mir spectrographs on 8-m and 10-m class telescopes probe nuclear regions in scales @xmath2100 pc for local agn , effectively resolving away most of the emission from the host ( see figure [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "this is evidenced by the very small equivalent widths ( ew ) of the pah features in the nuclear spectra @xcite and the tight correlation between the mir luminosity of the nuclear point source and the bolometric luminosity of the agn derived from hard x - ray observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , ground - based mir observations are limited to specific windows of atmospheric transmission and suffer from much lower sensitivity .",
    "current samples of agn with ground - based mir observations are limited to a few dozens of local sources with @xmath1813 m spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a few hundreds with n - band and/or q - band photometry @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to separate the spectral components corresponding to emission from the agn and the host in the integrated spectrum .",
    "multiple spectral decomposition methods have been applied to mir spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and combinations of both ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "libraries of theoretical models abound in the literature both for the ir emission of agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galaxies ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while they are suitable for fitting spectral energy distributions spanning a wide wavelength range , in general they can not reproduce accurately , for example , the diverse shapes of the 10 m silicate feature or the relative strength of individual pah bands .",
    "more detailed models of the mir spectrum containing dozens of physically motivated components , such as those produced by cafe @xcite or pahfit @xcite and its variants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allow to reproduce these features with high fidelity .",
    "however , the large number of free parameters involved ( more than 100 in the case of pahfit ) implies that solutions are often degenerate except in very high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectra .",
    "another approach that requires few free parameters yet provides acceptable fits for many mir spectra is spectral decomposition with empirical templates .",
    "most previous attempts at decomposing mir spectra with empirical templates have relied on two or three spectral components represented by universal templates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique usually models the effects of extinction by assuming a dust screen with a particular extinction law that applies to at least the agn component , and uses the value of @xmath3 as an extra free parameter .",
    "this simple approach has a caveat : while the mir emission from the host galaxy is relatively uniform across galaxies , it is simply not possible to reproduce the full range of seds observed in agn - dominated spectra by just varying the amount of extinction applied to a single agn template .",
    "this is not critical when only a narrow spectral range is considered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it quickly becomes an issue as the fitted spectral range grows .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that agn with a steeper 515 m slope compared to the chosen agn template require increasingly high contributions from a starburst continuum ( hii region ) template to obtain acceptable fits , even if no signs of star formation ( as in pah emission ) are observed .",
    ", width=317,height=226 ]    a complete description of the spectral components in a given spectrum requires not only finding the parameters of the best fitting model , but also their uncertainties .",
    "uncertainties are caused by both noise in the data and degeneracies in the template set . while most template fitting routines account for the former , the latter",
    "are usually ignored . in the last few years",
    ", algorithms based on bayesian inference have been developed to find the marginalised probability distribution of physical parameters from comparison of the observed data with all the models in the library .",
    "some remarkable examples are magphys @xcite and bayesclumpy @xcite",
    ". however , all these methods rely on grids of theoretical models with a uniform sampling of the parameter space to facilitate the calculation of probability distributions .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a new bayesian - like marginalisation method that is suitable for models with an irregular coverage of the parameter space , laying the groundwork for a complete description of spectral components based on purely empirical templates .    in this paper",
    "we take a new approach to spectral decomposition that uses libraries of observed high snr spectra as templates .",
    "we show that the method produces excellent fits that accurately reproduce most features in high snr spectra , yet it is robust against degeneracies even in poor snr spectra .",
    "we obtain reliable expectation values and uncertainties for agn properties by computing full probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) using a marginalisation method that overcomes the inhomogeneity in the template set . by comparing the derived agn properties with those obtained from ground - based high spatial resolution ( 0.4``0.8 '' ) mir photometry and spectroscopy , which exclude circumnuclear emission , we demonstrate that this kind of spectral decomposition is accurate at separating the emission from the agn and its host galaxy and recovering the shape of the agn spectrum . in ",
    "2 we present the method of spectral decomposition and our approach to the calculation of the expectation values of observables .",
    " 3 describes the set of templates and  4 the selection of the test sample . in  5 we present the results of the spectral decomposition and perform a careful validation by comparing the agn fluxes , spectral indices , and silicate strengths with those obtained from ground - based mir photometry and spectroscopy .",
    " 6 discuses the strengths and limitations of the method in light of the presented results , and  7 summarizes our main conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath4 = 70 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 = 0.3 , and @xmath7 = 0.7 .",
    "our approach to spectral decomposition relies on the assumption that the spectral shape of the agn and host galaxy emissions that contribute to the integrated spectrum can also be found in other sources where either the agn or the host completely dominates the emission . the emission from the host is itself a combination of that from the stars and the interstellar medium , with the former dominating in passively evolving galaxies ( at least at @xmath8@xmath215 m ) and the latter in star - forming ones .",
    "accordingly , any irs spectrum could be reproduced by a linear combination of three irs spectra selected from sets containing only extreme cases of ` pure - agn ' , ` pure - stellar ' , and ` pure - interstellar ' spectra . for clarity",
    ", we refer to these single - component spectra as templates .",
    "this procedure could raise several concerns .",
    "one is that agn feedback could have an impact on the interstellar medium , modifying the spectrum of the host , e.g. , by suppressing the pah features .",
    "however , nuclear spectra of nearby agn hosts at high spatial resolutions show no clear sign of pah suppression , even in the close vicinity of the agn @xcite",
    ". another issue could be that the host galaxy modifies the intrinsic agn spectrum via foreground extinction from dust in the line of sight to the agn . while foreground extinction can indeed be very strong in luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) , mergers , and edge - on galaxies @xcite",
    ", we do not intend to recover the intrinsic spectrum of the agn , but the one that would be observed at higher spatial resolution . since the extinction caused by the host is independent on its angular size or the luminosity of the agn , it should be possible to find a ` pure - agn ' template with the same intrinsic spectrum and the same level of ( host induced ) extinction but negligible host emission .",
    "modelling foreground absorption in the mir with an extinction law and a few empirical or semi - empirical ` intrinsic ' agn templates provides great flexibility .",
    "however , this relies on the assumption of the extinction law and is a path already well explored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our aim in this work is to produce spectral decompositions that are completely model - independent .",
    "therefore , we require the template set to be large and varied enough to reproduce both the diversity in the intrinsic spectra of agn and hosts _ and _ the different levels of foreground extinction to be found .",
    "our decomposition method is implemented in the deblendirs routine , written in the idl language .",
    "we build a library of templates ( see  [ templates - sect ] ) containing irs spectra of galaxies whose emission is strongly dominated by the stellar population ( stellar templates ) , the interstellar medium ( pah templates ) , or the active galactic nucleus ( agn templates ) .",
    "all the spectra ( the ones to be decomposed and the templates ) are de - redshifted and resampled to a common wavelength grid @xmath9 .",
    "we choose to resample with a wavelength resolution @xmath10=0.1 m .",
    "while the results of the decomposition do not depend significantly on @xmath10 , this value is larger than the resolution of the original spectra and therefore increases the snr per resolution element .",
    "the flux uncertainties @xmath0(@xmath8 ) are calculated for the resampled spectra assuming that random errors for adjacent pixels are not correlated .    for every galaxy in the sample we try spectral decompositions using every possible combination of one stellar template , one pah template , and one agn template .",
    "we represent each of these combinations with the tern of indices ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 ) for the @xmath11-th stellar template , the @xmath12-th pah template , and the @xmath13-th agn template .",
    "the decomposition model for the spectrum f(@xmath8 ) with the tern ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 ) is then :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the restframe flux densities of the templates , and the coefficients @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are obtained by minimising the @xmath21 :    @xmath22    since the model is linear on the coefficients , we can find the values that minimise @xmath21 algebraically .",
    "this is much faster than an iterative fit and allows to exhaustively explore all the possible template combinations in a few seconds .",
    "if any of the fit coefficients turns out to be negative , we fix it at zero and repeat the calculation for the other two until we arrive at a solution where all the coefficients are non - negative .",
    "we compare the minimum @xmath21 for each combination of templates to determine the one that produces the best @xmath21 of all models .",
    "we note that while the absolute minimum of @xmath21 identifies the best fitting model , its value is not a reliable indicator of the similarity between the model and the actual spectrum of the source , since it also depends on the snr of the spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at high snr , small differences between the spectrum and the model can be statistically significant given the small photometric errors , and it is not unusual to obtain a @xmath21 per degree of freedom @xmath23",
    "= @xmath21/(n-3 ) @xmath24 1 .",
    "however , in lower snr spectra differences between the spectrum and the model are blurred by the noise , and @xmath23@xmath251 is typical .",
    "a complementary statistic on the differences between the model and the spectrum is the coefficient of variation of the root - mean - square error ( cv@xmath26 ) :    @xmath27    which represents the ratio of the typical residual to the mean flux .",
    "this is formally equivalent to a @xmath23 that assumes flux uncertainties are proportional to fluxes , and therefore ignores the snr of the spectra .",
    "accordingly , a comparison of the two statistics provides a reliable diagnostics of the quality of the fit irrespective of the snr of the spectrum .    at constant snr ,",
    "both @xmath23 and cv@xmath26 decrease for increasingly accurate fits .",
    "however , unlike @xmath23 , cv@xmath26 increases if the snr is degraded .",
    "this is because larger flux uncertainties increase the residuals ( the numerator in eq .",
    "3 ) , but not the average flux . obtaining high values for both cv@xmath26 and",
    "@xmath23 implies that no model can correctly reproduce the spectra , while low @xmath23 and cv@xmath26 indicates a good fit with small relative residuals in a high snr spectrum .",
    "however , a low @xmath23 with high cv@xmath26 implies the model is compatible with the data just because the spectrum is noisy . while @xmath23 values are not directly comparable among sources due to differences in the snr of their spectra , the high snr of all the templates ensures that for a given source we can arrange the models by the quality of their fit using @xmath23 alone .",
    "the empirical nature of the templates implies that we can not expect a homogeneous and complete sampling of the parameter space defined by the physical properties of interest ( such as the spectral index of the agn component , @xmath28 , and the strength of its silicate feature , @xmath29 ) . instead",
    ", the most common values are well represented in the library by many templates that are similar to each other , while extreme values are underrepresented . since the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of a physical property",
    "is usually computed as the sum of the probabilities of all the models in given bins of the parameter space , the inhomogeneous sampling acts as a prior that favours the most densely sampled regions of the parameter space .",
    "thefore , to obtain reliable pdfs we need a method that is robust against variations in the density of templates throughout the parameter space , which would otherwise favour values that are overrepresented in the library .",
    "one such method is the ` max ' method described in @xcite .",
    "very briefly , we take the entire range of possible values for the parameter of interest , @xmath30 , and split it into same - sized bins . for each bin , @xmath11 , we find all the models that produce a value for the parameter within its limits , and take the lowest @xmath21 , @xmath31 .",
    "the probability of the parameter @xmath30 to take a value inside the bin @xmath11 is then :    @xmath32    where the normalisation ensures that the sum of the probabilities for all the bins is 1 . then , the expectation value for @xmath30 is :    @xmath33    and its standard deviation is :    @xmath34    obtaining a realistic pdf with the ` max ' method requires the bins to be large enough for each of them to contain at least one model .",
    "this is guaranteed for properties that depend on the _ coefficients _ of the three spectral components , such as the fractional contribution of the agn to the restframe 12 m luminosity ( l@xmath35 ) , given the large number of possible template combinations .",
    "for properties that depend on the _ templates _ themselves , such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , obtaining a correct sampling depends on the library .",
    "we restrict the modelling of the irs spectrum to the restframe 515 m spectral range .",
    "this is because the most prominent pah features ( which are essential to disentangle agn and host emission ) reside in this range , and at @xmath8@xmath3615 m discriminating between the continuum emission of the agn and the host becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "in addition , the fraction of the total continuum emission arising from the agn decreases at longer wavelengths , due to the combined effects of a flat agn spectrum and a steeply rising continuum from dust heated by star formation ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in extended sources ,",
    "this effect is exacerbated by the the larger aperture of the long - low ( ll ; 1438 m ; 10.5 `` ) irs module compared to short - low ( sl ; 5.214 m ; 3.6 '' ) which increases the contamination from the host in the latter .",
    "setting the long wavelength limit at 15 m restframe also implies that we can use as agn templates sources at redshifts up to @xmath37=1.5 while mantaining full spectral coverage .",
    "this is important because the diversity in agn spectral shapes requires the library of ` pure - agn ' spectra to be as large as possible for the best results ( see  [ templates - sect ] ) .",
    "all the templates employed here are irs low - resolution spectra from cassis of individual galaxies with full spectral coverage in the restframe range 5.315.8 m , reliable spectroscopic redshift , and high snr .",
    "all the templates have median snr per pixel @xmath3610 in the original spectra and @xmath3615 after the resampling .",
    "typical values are much higher , with 75% of templates at snr / pixel@xmath36100 after resampling .",
    "we select templates of three types , each of them representing a distinct physical component of the integrated mir emission of galaxies : the stellar population ( stellar templates ) , the interstellar medium ( pah templates ) and the agn ( agn templates ) .",
    "we put great care into making sure that only one of these components contributes significantly to the observed spectrum of the galaxies selected as templates .",
    "for this , we rely on three criteria : the slope of the mir continuum , the strength of the pah features , and the optical spectroscopic classification .    for the ` stellar ' templates , we select 19 local elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "to ensure they have negligible star formation , we require the pah bands to be very weak or absent , with equivalent widths for the 6.2 m ( ew@xmath38 ) and 11.3 m ( ew@xmath39 ) pah bands @xmath20.02 m ( see * ? ? ? * for the details on the measurement of the ew of the pah bands ) .",
    "we also check that the irs spectra have a blue stellar - like mir continuum and the sources are not classified as agn in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the 56 ` pah ' templates are irs spectra of normal star - foming and starburst galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath37=0.14 .",
    "we make sure these sources do not have significant stellar contributions to their mir spectra by requiring both high ew of the pah features ( ew@xmath38 @xmath36 1.0 m and ew@xmath39 @xmath36 1.0 m ) and a very weak continuum at 5 m .",
    "we also verify that they are not classified as agn in ned .",
    "finally , the agn templates are irs spectra of sources classified in the optical as quasars , seyfert galaxies , liners , and blazars .",
    "we also include a variety of optically obscured agn and radiogalaxies .",
    "the library of agn templates includes sources at redshifts from @xmath37=0.002 to @xmath37=1.4 and covers several orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity .",
    "we ensure that the agn templates do not contain any significant emission from the host galaxy by requiring the pah features to be extremely weak or absent ( ew@xmath38 @xmath2 0.02 m and ew@xmath39 @xmath2 0.02 m ) .",
    "some of the agn templates are from ( u-)lirgs with a deeply obscured nucleus , as evidenced by the strong water ice absorption bands and a deep silicate feature , together with very weak or absent pah features . in these sources ,",
    "the observed spectrum depends mostly on the geometry of the dust distribution , while the nature of the power source ( either agn , starburst , or a combination of both ) plays only a minor role @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we can not evaluate the actual agn contribution to the mir emission in these sources .",
    "we inspect all the agn templates with the 10 m silicate feature in absorption and classify them as bona fide agn ( agn ) or obscured nuclei ( obscured ) depending on the absence / presence of h@xmath40o absorption bands at @xmath16 m and/or a silicate strength @xmath29 @xmath2 - 1.5 ( see  [ agnproperties_subsect ] for the definition of @xmath29 ) . removing the obscured templates from the set of agn templates would force the decomposition routine to choose agn templates that provide poor fits to obscured sources . therefore",
    ", we opt to keep the obscured templates , but consider as upper limits the agn fractions and agn luminosities obtained in cases where the best fitting model involves an obscured template .",
    "the final selection of agn templates contains 181 spectra ( 159 bona fide agn and 22 obscured sources ) .",
    "figure [ fig : templates ] shows all the templates selected for use in the spectral decomposition , separated by type .",
    "bona fide agn and obscured sources are shown separately for clarity .",
    "spectral shapes show very small source to source variations among stellar templates , as is expected for spectra dominated by the rayleigh - jeans tail of stellar emission .",
    "pah and obscured templates show also small variations , mostly caused by the strength of the pah and silicate features , respectively .",
    "the largest diversity of shapes is found among the bona fide agn templates .",

    "we emphasize that even at the sub - arcsecond resolution of ground - based spectroscopy , nuclear spectra do not always represent accurately the agn emission , which can be extended or overlap with a nuclear starburst .",

    "we have found that the main limitation of our decomposition method is the existence of categories of sources whose spectra are not well reproduced , at least with the current library of templates .",
    "we have identified galaxies with deep silicate absorptions as one important such category .",
    "we consider that the reason for the poor fits in galaxies with deep absorptions is the small number of suitable templates in the library , which is caused by the difficulty in finding pure - agn and pure - pah spectra with deep absorption features within the limited ( albeit large ) set of available irs observations , since many of the spectra with such deep features belong to composite sources .",
    "the relatively small size and restricted selection criteria of our test sample implies that we can not rule out other categories of sources which could also prove difficult to model with the current library .",
    "even for source types that typically obtain good fits , there probably exist extreme cases of exotic spectra whose properties are beyond the normal range of variation covered by the templates .",
    "however , we expect these to be few in numbers .",
    "degeneracy was also a legitimate concern , since the large number of available templates suggested there could be many combinations of them capable of producing good fits with comparable @xmath21 values for any particular source .",
    "however , we found that while this is typically the case , the fractional contribution to the mir emission from each of the three spectral components is usually well constrained .",
    "the reason for this remarkable lack of degeneracy is probably the singular characteristics of the 515 m spectral range , where the spectral shapes of the stellar , interstellar ( pah ) , and agn emissions are clearly different from each other .",
    "because the spectra for the stellar and pah components show very limited variation , we can recover not just the strength of the agn emission but also its spectral shape .",
    "decomposition models that obtain good fits for a particular source usually involve agn templates very similar to each other , indicating that it is not easy for the stellar and pah templates to compensate for an agn template with , for example , the wrong spectral index or silicate strength .",
    "the presence in the library of many similar ( but not identical ) templates is not unnecessary redundancy : they help improve the fits by increasing the chances of reproducing fine details in the spectrum , like emission lines .",
    "this is important because in high snr spectra these fine details dominate over photometric errors in the residuals and cause large @xmath21 values if the template set is not varied enough .",
    "having multiple similar templates does not complicate the calculation of pdfs for agn properties thanks to the mechanics of the ` max ' method .",
    "in fact , the resolution of the pdfs is limited by the size of the template set , since at least one template in each bin is required . more detailed pdfs allow for better estimates of the uncertainties in agn properties .",
    "we have compared our results from the spectral decomposition with ground - based high spatial resolution imaging and spectroscopy as the ultimate test for our method .",
    "there is a general agreement between galaxy - subtracted agn and nuclear fluxes within their uncertainties , and a good correspondence in @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "* ) , or those to be obtained in the near future with the mid - infrared instrument ( miri ) onboard the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) . however , there are also discrepancies , which in some cases suggest a poor decomposition and in others seem caused by a significant contribution from the host even at the sub - arcsecond scales of the nuclear photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the sensitivity of the fit to the shape of the agn template depends on the relative contribution of the agn component to the mir emission within the irs aperture .",
    "when it is low , the uncertainty in the spectral shape of the agn is large .",
    "this means that agn properties other than its luminosity are poorly constrained if the host galaxy strongly dominates the emission within the extraction aperture .",
    "this fundamental limitation of the decomposition method implies that high spatial resolution observations are necessary if the agn does not dominate the integrated emission of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , even for agn - dominated sources , ground - based high angular resolution observations are still required to infer the spatial distribution of the host emission ( for example , to distinguish between nuclear , circumnuclear , or galaxy - wide star formation ) and to detect weak fine structure lines .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated a new data - driven method for spectral decomposition of mid - infrared spectra that uses as templates sets of real spectra from individual sources whose emission is strongly dominated by a single physical component .",
    "we have shown that this decomposition method produces fits with an excellent accuracy for the _ spitzer_/irs spectra of composite sources , with residuals a factor @xmath12 lower than those of a competing algorithm with a higher number of free parameters .",

    "we used the latest public version of decompir , with all nine parameters defining the model set free .",

    "interestingly , all the sources with deep silicate features that obtained poor fits ( large residuals ) with our routine also obtain equally large or even larger residuals with decompir .",
    "this is despite the fact that decompir uses two free parameters to fit the extinction in the agn and the host separately . by default",
    ", decompir limits the range of available optical depths at 9.7 m , @xmath65 , to the interval [ 0,5 ] for both the agn and the host . in many of the sources with deep silicates the best fitting model uses @xmath65=5 for either the agn or the host ( or both ) , suggesting a wider range is needed . after increasing the maximum @xmath65 to 15 ,",
