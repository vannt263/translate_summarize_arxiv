    "in 2006 , babar collaboration first reported a broad structure @xmath10 with mass @xmath11 mev and full width @xmath12 mev @xcite , almost at the same time , belle collaboration also reported a new strange charmed @xmath5 state @xmath0 , with mass @xmath13 mev and width @xmath14 mev @xcite , later modified to @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev @xcite . in 2009 , babar showed their new observation of @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath17 mev and a broad full width @xmath18 mev . recently , lhcb collaboration confirmed the existence of the @xmath0 and measured its mass and width to be @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 mev @xcite .    based on different models , interested theorists gave different assignments of @xmath0 .",
    "in the works of refs .",
    "@xcite , authors consider the possibility of it to be a multiquark configuration , but their conclusions are negative .",
    "most authors believe that it is a conventional @xmath4 state .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the first radial excited @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) state is favored , while in ref .",
    "@xcite , the orbitally excited @xmath23 ( @xmath6 ) state is expected , and others @xcite believe it is most likely a mixture of @xmath24 .    although its existence has been confirmed by three different experiments through different production mechanism , and the data of its mass and full width agree with each other s within their error bars , @xmath0 is not currently reported in the summary table of the particle data group .",
    "this shows that more careful experimental researches and theoretical studies are still needed . in this paper , we give another assignment of @xmath0 .",
    "we claim that the current detected @xmath0 is not a single state , but could be two overlapping states .",
    "one of them is the @xmath22 dominant state with a little @xmath25 wave mixed in it . throughout the whole paper ,",
    "we use the symbol @xmath26 to label this @xmath22 dominant state , and since there may be confusion , it will be also called low - mass state .",
    "the other is @xmath6 dominant state with a little @xmath27 wave mixed in it , we use the symbol @xmath28 for it , or high - mass state if there is confusion . because the invariant mass distributions describing these two resonances overlap together , it is equal to say the overlapping states are mixtures of pure @xmath22 state and pure @xmath6 state .",
    "there are several reasons resulting in this overlapping assignment of two states , we will show these in different aspects . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the masses and wave functions of @xmath5 @xmath4 states ; in section 3 , we show the decay modes and relative branching ratios ; the production rates of @xmath22 and @xmath6 states in @xmath29 decays is given in section 4 ; finally we do some discussions and make a conclusion in the last section .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath4 @xmath22 and @xmath6 states have similar masses , and the same quantum number @xmath30 , so they mix together , and become other two different states .",
    "there are many examples , such as @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath32 is a @xmath6 dominant state but mixed with some contribution from @xmath22 wave , famous as the @xmath33 mixing state ( there may be some contributions from @xmath34 and @xmath35 states , see ref .",
    "@xcite for example ) , while @xmath31 is the orthogonal partner of @xmath32 , and it is @xmath22 dominant state with a little @xmath25 wave mixed in it . after mixing ,",
    "two pure @xmath22 and @xmath6 states change into another two mixing states : @xmath36 @xmath37 where the mixing angle @xmath38 , and because of @xmath27 wave dominant , @xmath39 is the low - mass mixing state , while @xmath40 is @xmath25 wave dominant high - mass state .",
    "the method above of mixing seems sort of artificial , so we do not choose this method . instead",
    ", we believe that the reason of mixing is @xmath22 and @xmath6 states have the same quantum number of @xmath30 , and the forms of their wave functions are similar for the same reason . when we choose a relativistic method based on quantum field theory to deal with the bound state problem , the @xmath22 and @xmath6 states will be obtained , and the mixing should be exist automatically , not like man - made by hand .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite is such a relativistic method to describe a bound state , by solving it , the eigenvalue and relativistic wave function for a bound state will be obtained .",
    "so we choose the ordinary cornell potential , and solve the exact instantaneous bethe - salpeter equations ( or the salpeter equations @xcite ) for @xmath41 states .",
    "as expected , @xmath22 dominant state mixed with a little @xmath25 wave component and @xmath6 dominant state mixed with a little @xmath27 wave component are obtained .",
    "we will outline the key point in this section .",
    "the general form of a relativistic wave function for a vector meson ( @xmath22 or @xmath6 , or their mixing states ) can be written as 16 terms constructed by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the gamma matrices . because we make the instantaneous approximation of the bs method , the 8 terms with @xmath45 vanished .",
    "so the general form for the relativistic salpeter wave function which has the quantum number of @xmath46 for a vector state can be written as @xcite : @xmath47 + m{\\not\\!\\epsilon}^{\\lambda}_{\\perp}f_5(q_{\\perp})\\ ] ] @xmath48 where the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath49 are the momentum , relative inner momentum and polarization vector of the vector meson , respectively ; @xmath50 is a function of @xmath51 , and we have used the notation @xmath52 ( which is @xmath53 in the center of mass system ) .      with this form of wave functions , we solved the full salpeter equation for @xmath5 states numerically . for strange quark",
    ", we choose the constitute quark mass @xmath58 mev ; for the parameter @xmath59 , we give it by fitting the ground state mass @xmath60 mev ; for other parameters , we choose the same values as given in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass spectra of @xmath4 and @xmath61 systems are shown in table i , where we also show the experimental data of @xmath61 system from particle data group @xcite .",
    "one can see that our predictions for the mass of @xmath61 @xmath5 system fit the data very well . for @xmath62 vector states",
    ", we found there are two states around @xmath7 mev , their masses are @xmath63 mev and @xmath64 mev .    to see the nature of these states ,",
    "we draw the wave functions of the first three states in figure  1 - 3 .",
    "the results show that , each state has four different wave functions , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "for the first two states , the numerical values of @xmath27 wave functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are dominant , while the @xmath25 wave components , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 always show up followed by @xmath71 ) are neglected .",
    "so we conclude that the first one with mass @xmath72 mev is the ground state @xmath73 , and the second one with a node structure is the @xmath22 dominant state . for the third state , see figure 3 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 are all sizable , and they look all like @xmath25 waves on seemingly .",
    "but if we write them in spherical polar coordinates , there are sizable @xmath27 wave components mixed in @xmath25 wave ( the @xmath74 term of @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( 21 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so the third state is a @xmath25 wave dominant state .",
    "as for the @xmath27 wave dominant states , @xmath34 and @xmath22 states ( see figures 1 - 2 ) , we have the rough relations @xmath76 and @xmath77 . if we delete the negligible terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , then the vector wave function is changed to the non - relativistic case @xmath78 .",
    "but if we solve the salpeter equation with this non - relativistic wave function form as input , as expected , we only obtain the @xmath34 , @xmath22 , @xmath35 states , _ et al _ , and no @xmath25 wave states appear in this non - relativistic case . in this case",
    ", the @xmath25 wave state has to be dealt with another wave function form as input and the mixing should be treated as the method shown in eq .",

    "we list some of them which have both the masses of @xmath22 and @xmath6 in table  [ mass ] . except our results ,",
    "all of the predictions are pure @xmath22 and @xmath6 states , and the mass shift @xmath87 between @xmath22 and @xmath6 is also shown in table  [ mass ] , the values of mass shifts lie in the region from @xmath88 mev to @xmath89 mev .",
    "we notice that in the mass region of @xmath90 mev which has been scanned by experiments , currently there is no @xmath5 candidate except @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath5 candidate @xmath92 observed by selex collaboration @xcite has not been confirmed by babar @xcite , cleo and focus @xcite , and its mass of @xmath93 mev seems a little small as a @xmath22 or @xmath6 state ( see table  [ mass ] ) .",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath6 @xmath94 @xmath5 vector states around @xmath7 mev ( or higher ) can decay to @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . comparing with other possible decay channels ,",
    "these six have dominant branching ratios because they are all ozi allowed strong decays .",
    "so one can use them to estimate the full widths of @xmath22 and @xmath6 .    in a previous letter @xcite , we have already calculated the pure @xmath101 or @xmath102 @xmath94 @xmath103 state decaying to @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath99 @xcite , where we used the reduction formula , pcac relation and low energy theorem , thus the transition @xmath27-matrix is given as a formula involving the light meson decay constant and the corresponding transition matrix element between two heavy mesons .",
    "the transition matrix element is written as an overlapping integral of the relevant wave functions , which are obtained numerically by solving the salpeter equation with further non - relativistic approximation . in this paper , we re - calculate the ozi allowed decay modes but with full wave functions as input , and use the new predicted masses of @xmath22 and @xmath6 in table i as input , so three more channels are opened , and the results are shown in table iii , where the errors in our results are obtained by varying all the input parameters simultaneously within @xmath104 .",
    "we do not repeat the calculation here , interested reader can find the details in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can see that , both @xmath105 and @xmath106 have broad full widths , since they have at least 6 ozi allowed strong decay channels .",
    "the full width of @xmath106 is much broader than that of @xmath105 , which is caused by two reasons .",
    "one is the node structure of @xmath22 wave function ( see figure 2 ) : the @xmath22 wave function before the node provides positive contribution to the width , while after the node it gives negative contribution",
    ". the @xmath106 state does not suffer from the node structure since it s wave function has no node structure as a @xmath6 state .",
    "the other reason is that the higher mass state @xmath106 has larger phase space .",

    "@xmath129 the former is consistent with belle s data , and the later is about one order smaller .",
    "these results show that the production of @xmath22 state @xmath105 is favored , while @xmath6 state @xmath106 is suppressed in the experiment of belle .",
    "the new state @xmath0 detected by belle is based on an analysis of @xmath130 events collected at the @xmath131 resonance .",
    "while in the experiment of babar , their analysis of @xmath0 is based on data sample recorded at the @xmath131 resonance and @xmath132 mev below the resonance , and the background from @xmath133 events is removed by requiring the center of mass momentum @xmath134 of the @xmath8 or @xmath9 system to be greater than @xmath135 gev . unlike belle or babar ,",
    "lhcb collaboration try to made sure that the candidates of @xmath0 are produced in the primary @xmath136 interaction , and reduces the contribution from particles originating from @xmath137hadron decays .",
    "it is not clear to us whether the @xmath6 state @xmath106 is suppressed or not in the experiments of babar and lhcb , but according to the broad full width @xmath138 mev of @xmath0 and the ratio shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) detected by babar , it seems that there is no suppression of @xmath6 state @xmath106 .",
    "we also point out that it is crucial to detect the ratio @xmath139 in belle and lhcb to see if the @xmath6 state is suppressed or not .",
    "it is known that there exist the @xmath22 and @xmath6 vector states , and their masses are usually close to each other . in the case of @xmath4 bound states ,",
    "the mass predictions by different theoretical models are listed in table  [ mass ] , and we did find that most of the predicted mass shifts @xmath140 are small . in table",
    "[ ourwid ] and table  [ widths ] , theoretical models also show that both @xmath22 and @xmath6 are broad states .",
    "two states whose full widths are all broad with closed masses means that we will find overlapping in @xmath8 or @xmath9 invariant mass distributions in the mass regions of @xmath22 and @xmath6 @xmath4 states .",
    "some models , for example , godfrey @xcite estimated a higher mass of @xmath6 state with large mass shift @xmath140 , but we argue that higher @xmath6 mass will result in broader full width . and currently , the scanned results in experiment show that there is no other @xmath5 state candidate in the mass region from @xmath141 mev to @xmath142 mev",
    ". one may argue that the production of @xmath6 state may be suppressed like in belle , but the @xmath143 state of @xmath144 mev is already found , there is no reason to believe that it is more difficult to produce a @xmath6 state than to produce a @xmath143 state .    for the pure @xmath22 state assignment of @xmath0 , theoretically , except for ref .",
    "@xcite , which gives a large @xmath22 full width of @xmath145 mev , all the predictions show that the pure @xmath22 whose full width ranges from @xmath146 to @xmath147 mev is too narrow to fit data , and the ratios of @xmath0 decays to @xmath9 over those to @xmath8 can not match data except the result of colangelo @xcite . for a pure @xmath6 assignment , though the predicted full widths can match the data , we still can not explain the ratio of @xmath148 detected by babar , and we can not explain why we found the @xmath6 state , but the @xmath22 state is not found since the later is favored while the former is suppressed in belle . so the pure @xmath22 and pure @xmath6 assignment of @xmath0 can be ruled out .",
    "the other possibility is that @xmath0 is a @xmath33 mixing state .",
    "as shown in the bs relativistic method , the reason of mixing is that they have the same quantum number of @xmath5 , and the way of mixing may not follow the the method shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "even we believe that it is correct , _",
    "i.e _ , two states @xmath22 and @xmath6 mix together , and after mixing , they turn into another two mixing states . experiment find one of them , the open question is , where is the orthogonal partner of this found mixing state ?",
    "one may argue that the missing one may be far away from the region of @xmath7 mev .",
    "but if it is true , then there is no reason to mix together .",
    "so the most reasonable assignment is that @xmath0 is not one single state , but two overlapping states , @xmath26 and @xmath28 , both of them are broad states and there is a narrow mass gap between them .",
    "so the @xmath8 or @xmath9 invariant mass distributions from their decays overlap together , and then one single state @xmath0 with a broader full width is detected and reported in experiments .",
    "we point out that , with same quantum number @xmath30 and close masses , the two broad overlapping states can not be easily distinguished by angular analysis in experiments . by this two overlapping states assignment ,",
    "the experimental data can be explained easily .",
    "if we set the possibilities of production of @xmath26 and @xmath28 are same , we roughly estimate that a state with mass @xmath149 mev and full width @xmath150 mev will be detected by experiments , and the predicted ratio is @xmath151 , all these values consist with the experimental data .    in summary , from a study of relativistic bs method , we find around mass region @xmath7 mev , there are two @xmath4 states , @xmath26 and @xmath28 , which have the same quantum number @xmath30 and similar masses .",
    "theoretical calculations show that both of them have broad full width , so they overlap together .",
    "this two states assignment of @xmath0 can fit data very well .",

    "<S> . it may be a @xmath1 , @xmath2 or the mixture of @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 state . by considering its mass , decay modes , full width , production rate , and comparing with current experimental data , </S>",
    "<S> we point out that there is another more reasonable assignment : @xmath0 could be identified as two resonances , one of which is a @xmath1 state , another is a @xmath6 state , and both are @xmath4 @xmath5 states . </S>",
    "<S> the two states have very close masses , which are around @xmath7 mev , and both have broad decay widths . </S>",
    "<S> so in experiments , the overlapping of @xmath8 or @xmath9 invariant mass distribution coming from their decays is found , but the current experiments could not distinguish these two resonances and reported one particle . </S>"
