    "quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an early epoch of inflation provide a plausible mechanism to generate the energy - density perturbations responsible for observed cosmological structure . while it has been known for quite some time that inflation is consistent with open spatial hypersurfaces ( gott 1982 ; guth &  weinberg 1983 ) , attention was initially focussed on models in which there are a very large number of @xmath17-foldings during inflation , resulting in almost exactly flat spatial hypersurfaces for the observable part of the present universe ( guth 1981 ; also see kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981a , b ) .",
    "this was , perhaps , inevitable because of strong theoretical prejudice towards flat spatial hypersurfaces and their resulting simplicity .",
    "however , to get a very large number of @xmath17-foldings during inflation it seems necessary that the inflation model have a small dimensionless parameter ( j. r. gott , private communication 1994 ; banks et al .",
    "1995 ) , which would require an explanation .",
    "attempts to reconcile these  favoured \" flat spatial hypersurfaces with observational measures of a low value for the clustered - mass density parameter @xmath1 have concentrated on models in which one postulates the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath18 ( peebles 1984 ) . in the simplest flat-@xmath18 model one assumes a scale - invariant ( harrison 1970 ; peebles &   yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) primordial power spectrum for gaussian adiabatic energy - density perturbations .",
    "such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an early epoch of inflation in a spatially - flat model , provided that the inflaton potential is reasonably flat ( fischler , ratra , &  susskind 1985 , and references therein ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that these models are indeed consistent with current observational constraints ( e.g. , stompor , grski , &  banday 1995 ; ostriker &  steinhardt 1995 ; ratra &  sugiyama 1995 ; liddle et al .",
    "1996b ; ganga , ratra , &  sugiyama 1996b , hereafter grs ) .",
    "an alternative , more popular of late , is to accept that the spatial hypersurfaces are not flat . in this case , the radius of curvature for the open spatial sections introduces a new length scale ( in addition to the hubble length ) , which requires a generalization of the usual flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( ratra &  peebles 1994 , hereafter rp94 ) .",
    "such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an epoch of inflation in an open - bubble model ( rp94 ; ratra &  peebles 1995 , hereafter rp95 ; bucher et al . 1995 , hereafter bgt ; lyth &  woszczyna 1995 ; yamamoto et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter yst ) , provided that the inflaton potential inside the bubble is reasonably flat .",
    "such gaussian adiabatic open - bubble inflation models have also been shown to be consistent with current observational constraints ( rp94 ; kamionkowski et al .",
    "1994 ; grski et al .",

    "inflation theory by itself is unable to predict the normalization amplitude for the energy - density perturbations .",
    "currently , the least controversial and most robust method for the normalization of a cosmological model is to fix the amplitude of the model - predicted large - scale cmb spatial anisotropy by comparing it to the observed cmb anisotropy discovered by the @xmath0-dmr experiment ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ) .    previously , specific open cold dark matter ( cdm ) models have been examined in light of the @xmath0-dmr two - year results ( bennett et al .",
    "grsb investigated the cmb anisotropy angular spectra predicted by the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) , and compared large - scale structure predictions of this dmr - normalized model to observational data .",
    "cayn et al .",
    "( 1996 ) performed a related analysis for the open model with a flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( wilson 1983 , hereafter w83 ) , and yamamoto &  bunn ( 1996 , hereafter yb ) examined the effect of additional sources of quantum fluctuations ( bgt ; yst ) in the open - bubble inflation model .    in this paper",
    ", we study the observational predictions for a number of open cdm models .",
    "in particular , we employ the power spectrum estimation technique devised by grski ( 1994 ) for incomplete sky coverage to normalize the open models using the @xmath0-dmr four - year data ( bennett  1996 ) .",
    "in @xmath19 we provide an overview of open - bubble inflation cosmogonies .",
    "in @xmath20 we detail the various dmr data sets used in the analyses here , discuss the various open models we consider , and present the dmr estimate of the cmb rms quadrupole anisotropy amplitude @xmath21 as a function of @xmath1 for these open models . in @xmath22",
    "we detail the computation of several cosmographic and large - scale structure statistics for the dmr - normalized open models .",
    "these statistics are confronted by various current observational constraints in @xmath23 .",
    "our results are summarized in @xmath24 .",
    "the simplest open inflation model is that in which a single open - inflation bubble nucleates in a ( possibly ) spatially - flat , inflating spacetime ( gott 1982 ; guth &  weinberg 1983 ) . in this model ,",
    "the first epoch of inflation smooths away any preexisting spatial inhomogeneities , while simultaneously generating quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations .",
    "then , in a tunnelling event , an open - inflation bubble nucleates , and for a small enough nucleation probability the observable universe lies inside a single open - inflation bubble . fluctuations of relevance to the late - time universe can be generated via three different quantum mechanical mechanisms : ( 1 ) they can be generated in the first epoch of inflation ; ( 2 ) they can be generated during the tunnelling event ( thus resulting in a slightly inhomogeneous initial hypersurface inside the bubble , or a slightly non - spherical bubble ) ; and ( 3 ) they can be generated inside the bubble .",
    "the tunneling amplitude is largest for the most symmetrical solution ( and deviations from symmetry lead to an exponential suppression ) , so it has usually been assumed that the nucleation process ( mechanism [ 2 ] ) does not lead to the generation of significant inhomogeneities .",
    "quantum - mechanical fluctuations generated during evolution inside the bubble ( rp95 ) are significant . assuming that the energy - density difference between the two epochs of inflation is negligible ( and so the bubble wall is not significant )",
    ", one may estimate the contribution to the perturbation spectrum after bubble nucleation from quantum - mechanical fluctuations during the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) . as discussed by bucher &  turok ( 1995 , hereafter bt ) ( also see yst ; yb ) , the observable predictions of these simple open - bubble inflation models are almost completely insensitive to the details of the first epoch of inflation , for the observationally - viable range of @xmath1 .",
    "this is because the fluctuations generated during this epoch affect only the smallest wavenumber part of the energy - density perturbation power spectrum , which can not contribute significantly to observable quantities because of the spatial curvature length",
    " cutoff \" in an open universe ( e.g. , w83 ; kamionkowski &  spergel 1994 ; rp95 ) .",
    "inclusion of such fluctuations in the calculations alter the predictions for the present value of the rms linear mass fluctuations averaged over an @xmath25 mpc sphere , @xmath26 $ ] , by @xmath27 ( which is comparable to our computational accuracy ) .    besides the open - bubble inflation model spectra , a variety of alternatives have also been considered .",
    "predictions for the usual flat - space scale - invariant spectrum in an open model have been examined ( w83 ; abbott &  schaefer 1986 ; gouda , sugiyama , &  sasaki 1991 ; sugiyama &  gouda 1992 ; kamionkowski &  spergel 1994 ; sugiyama &  silk 1994 ; cayn et al .",
    "the possibility that the standard formulation of quantum mechanics is incorrect in an open universe , and that allowance must be made for non - square - integrable basis functions has been investigated ( lyth &  woszczyna 1995 ) , and other spectra have also been considered ( e.g. , w83 ; abbott &  schaefer 1986 ; kamionkowski &  spergel 1994 ) .",
    "these spectra , being inconsistent with either standard quantum mechanics or the length scale set by spatial curvature , are of historical interest .",
    "more recently , the open - bubble inflation scenario has been further elaborated on .",
    "yst have considered a very specific model for the nucleation of the open bubble in a spatially - flat de sitter spacetime , and demonstrated a possible additional contribution from a non - square - integrable basis function which depends on the form of the potential , and on the assumed form of the quantum state prior to bubble nucleation . however , since the non - square - integrable basis function contributes only on the very largest scales , the spatial curvature  cutoff \" in an open universe makes almost all of the model predictions insensitive to this basis function , for the observationally - viable range of @xmath1 ( yst ; yb ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath28 its effect is to change @xmath26 $ ]  by @xmath29 .    an additional possible effect determined for the specific model of an open - inflation bubble nucleating in a spatially - flat de sitter",
    "spacetime is that fluctuations of the bubble wall behave like a non - square - integrable basis function ( hamazaki et al .",
    "1996 ; garriga 1996 ; garca - bellido 1996 ; yamamoto , sasaki , &  tanaka 1996 ) . while there are models in which these bubble - wall fluctuations are completely insignificant ( garriga 1996 ; yamamoto et al .",
    "1996 ) , there is as yet no computation that accounts for both the bubble - wall fluctuations as well as those generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( which are always present ) , so it is not yet known if bubble - wall fluctuations can give rise to an observationally significant effect .",
    "finally , again in this very specific model , the effects of a finite bubble size at nucleation seem to alter the zero bubble size predictions only by a very small amount ( yamamoto et al .",
    "1996 ; cohn 1996 ) .    while there is no guarantee that there is a spatially - flat de sitter spacetime prior to bubble nucleation",
    ", these computations do illustrate the important point that the spatial curvature length  cutoff \" in an open universe ( e.g. , rp95 ) does seem to ensure that what happens prior to bubble nucleation does not significantly affect the observable predictions for observationally - viable single - field open - bubble inflation models .",
    "it is indeed reassuring that accounting only for the quantum mechanical fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) seems to be essentially all that is required to make observational predictions for the single - field open - bubble inflation models .",
    "that is , the observational predictions of the open - bubble inflation scenario seem to be as robust as those for the spatially - flat inflation scenario .",
    "in this paper , we utilize the dmr four - year 53 and 90 ghz sky maps in both galactic and ecliptic coordinates .",
    "we thus quantify explicitly the expected small shifts in the inferred normalization amplitudes due to the small differences between the galactic- and ecliptic - coordinate maps .",
    "the maps are coadded using inverse - noise - variance weights derived in each coordinate system .",
    "the least sensitive 31 ghz maps have been omitted from the analysis , since their contribution is minimal under such a weighting scheme .",
    "the dominant source of emission in the dmr maps is due to the galactic plane .",
    "we are unable to model this contribution to the sky temperature to sufficient accuracy to enable its subtraction , thus we excise all pixels where the galactic - plane signal dominates the cmb .",
    "the geometry of the cut has been determined by using the dirbe 140 @xmath30 m map as a tracer of the strongest emission , as described completely in banday  ( 1996a ) .",
    "all pixels with galactic latitude @xmath31 20@xmath32@xmath33 are removed , together with regions towards scorpius - ophiucus and taurus - orion .",
    "there are 3881 surviving pixels in galactic coordinates and 3890 in ecliptic .",
    "this extended ( four - year data ) galactic plane cut has provided the biggest impact on the analysis of the dmr data ( see grski et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter g96 ) .",
    "the extent to which residual high - latitude galactic emission can modify our results has been quantified in two ways . since the spatial morphology of galactic synchrotron",
    ", free - free and dust emission seems to be well described by a steeply falling power spectrum ( @xmath34  kogut  1996a , g96 ) , the cosmological signal is predominantly compromised on the largest angular scales . as a simple test of galactic contamination",
    ", we perform all computations both including and excluding the observed sky quadrupole . a more detailed approach ( g96 )",
    "notes that a large fraction of the galactic signal can be accounted for by using the dirbe 140 @xmath30 m sky map ( reach  1995 ) as a template for free - free and dust emission , and the 408 mhz all - sky radio survey ( haslam  1981 ) to describe synchrotron emission .",
    "a correlation analysis yields coupling coefficients for the two templates at each of the dmr frequencies .",
    "we have repeated our model analysis after correcting the coadded sky maps by the galactic templates scaled by the coefficients derived in g96 . in particular , we adopt those values derived under the assumption that the cmb anisotropy is well - described by an @xmath35 = 1 power law model with normalization amplitude @xmath21  @xmath36 18 @xmath30k  and coupling coefficient amplitudes .",
    "in fact , we have investigated this for a sub - sample of the models considered here in which we varied @xmath1 but fixed @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "no statistically significant changes were found in the derived values of either @xmath21  or the coupling coefficients . ] .",
    "one might make criticisms of either technique : excluding information from an analysis , in this case the quadrupole components , can obviously weaken any conclusions simply because statistical uncertainties will grow ; at the same time , it is not clear whether the galactic corrections applied are completely adequate .",
    "we believe that , given these uncertainties , our analysis is the most complete and conservative one that is possible .    the power spectrum analysis technique developed by grski ( 1994 ) is implemented .",
    "orthogonal basis functions for the fourier decomposition of the sky maps are constructed which specifically include both pixelization effects and the galactic cut .",
    "( these are linear combinations of the usual spherical harmonics with multipole @xmath37 . )",
    "the functions are coordinate system dependent . a likelihood analysis is then performed as described in grski  ( 1994 ) .",
    "we consider four open model energy - density perturbation power spectra : ( 1 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , accounting only for fluctuations that are generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) ; ( 2 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for the fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) ; ( 3 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for both the usual fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation and a contribution from a non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) ; and , ( 4 ) an open model with a flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( w83 ) . in all cases",
    "we have ignored the possibility of tilt or primordial gravity waves , since it is unlikely that they can have a significant effect in viable open models .    with the eigenvalue of the spatial scalar laplacian being @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the radial coordinate spatial wavenumber , the gauge - invariant fractional energy - density perturbation power spectrum of type ( 1 ) above is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the transfer function and @xmath42 is the normalization amplitude ) generalize the primordial part of the spectrum of eq .",
    "( 1 ) by multiplying it with @xmath43 . as yet , only the specific @xmath44 generalized spectrum ( i.e. , eq .",
    "[ 1 ] ) is known to be a prediction of an open - bubble inflation model and therefore consistent with the presence of spatial curvature .",
    "it is premature to draw conclusions about open cosmogony on the basis of the @xmath45 version of the spectrum considered by bw . ] . in the simplest example , perturbations generated in the first epoch of inflation introduce an additional multiplicative factor , @xmath46 , on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . for a discussion of the effects of the non - square - integrable basis function see yst and yb .",
    "the energy - density power spectrum of type ( 4 ) above is @xmath47 and in this case one can also consider , e.g. , @xmath48 ( w83 ) , but because of the spatial curvature  cutoff \" in an open model the predictions are essentially indistinguishable . at",
    "small @xmath49 the asymptotic expressions are @xmath50 ( type 1 ) , @xmath51 ( type 2 ) , and @xmath52 ( type 4 ) .",
    "conventionally , the cmb fractional temperature perturbation , @xmath53 , is expressed as a function of angular position , @xmath54 , on the sky via the spherical harmonic decomposition , @xmath55 the cmb spatial anisotropy in a gaussian model can then be characterized by the angular perturbation spectrum @xmath56 , defined in terms of the ensemble average , @xmath57    the @xmath56 s used here were computed using two independent boltzmann transfer codes developed by ns ( e.g. , sugiyama 1995 ) and rs ( e.g. , stompor 1994 ) .",
    "some illustrative comparisons are shown in fig .",
    "we emphasize that the excellent agreement between the @xmath56 s computed using the two codes is mostly a reflection of the currently achievable numerical accuracy .",
    "currently , the major likely additional , unaccounted for , source of uncertainty is that due to the uncertainty in the modelling of various physical effects .",
    "the computations here assume a standard recombination thermal history , and ignore the possibility of early reionization .",
    "the simplest open models ( with the least possible number of free parameters ) have yet to be ruled out by observational data ( grsb ; ratra et al .",
    "1995 ; grs ; this paper ) , so there is insufficient motivation to expand the model - parameter space by including the effect of early reionization , tilt or gravity waves values determined from the dmr data here ( assuming no early reionization ) are unlikely to be very significantly affected by early reionization . however , since structure forms earlier in an open model , other effects of early reionization might be more significant in an open model .",
    "while it is possible to heuristically account for such effects , an accurate quantitative estimate must await a better understanding of structure formation . ] .",
    "for the @xmath58 of types ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 4 ) above , we have evaluated the cmb anisotropy angular spectra for a range of @xmath1 spanning the interval between 0.1 and 1.0 , for a variety of values of @xmath2 ( the hubble parameter @xmath59 ) and the baryonic - mass density parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the values of @xmath2 were selected to cover the lower part of the range of ages consistent with current requirements ( @xmath60 10.5 gyr , 12 gyr , or 13.5 gyr , with @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 computed accordingly ; see , for example , jimenez et al .",
    "1996 ; chaboyer et al .",
    "the values of @xmath10 were chosen to be consistent with current standard nucleosynthesis requirements ( @xmath61 0.0055 , 0.0125 , or 0.0205 ; e.g. , copi , schramm , &   turner 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . to render the problem tractable ,",
    "@xmath56 s were determined for the central values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and for the two combinations of these parameters which most perturb the @xmath56 s from those computed at the central values ( i.e. , for the smallest @xmath62 we used the smallest @xmath63 , and for the largest @xmath62 we used the largest @xmath63 ) .",
    "specific parameter values are given in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of tables 16 , and representative anisotropy spectra can be seen in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "we therefore improve on our earlier analysis of the dmr two - year data ( grsb ) by considering a suitably broader range in the ( @xmath10 , @xmath2 ) parameter space .",
    "the cmb anisotropy spectra for @xmath58 of type ( 3 ) above were computed for a range of @xmath1 spanning the interval between 0.1 and 0.9 , for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "5 we compare the various spectra considered here .    the differences in the low-@xmath66 shapes of the @xmath56 s in the various models ( figs .",
    "25 ) are a consequence of three effects : ( 1 ) the shape of the energy - density perturbation power spectrum at low wavenumber ; ( 2 ) the exponential suppression at the spatial curvature scale in an open model ; and ( 3 ) the interplay between the  usual \" ( fiducial cdm ) sachs - wolfe term and the  integrated \" sachs - wolfe ( hereafter sw ) term in the expression for the cmb spatial anisotropy . the relative importance of these effects is determined by the value of @xmath1 , and leads to the non - monotonic behaviour of the large - scale @xmath56 s as a function of @xmath1 seen in figs .",
    "more precisely , the contributions to the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum from the  usual \" and  integrated \" sw terms have a different @xmath66-dependence as well as a relative amplitude that is both @xmath1 and @xmath58 dependent .    on very large angular scales ( small @xmath66 s ) , the dominant contribution to the  usual \" sw term comes from a higher redshift ( when the length scales are smaller ) than does the dominant contribution to the  integrated \" sw term ( hu &  sugiyama 1994 , 1995 ) . as a result , in an open model on very large angular scales , the  usual \"",
    "sw term is cut off more sharply by the spatial curvature length scale than is the  integrated \" sw term ( hu &  sugiyama 1994 ) , i.e. , on very large angular scales in an open model the  usual \" sw term has a larger ( positive ) effective index @xmath35 than the  integrated \" sw term . on slightly smaller angular scales",
    "the  integrated \" sw term is damped ( i.e. , it has a negative effective index @xmath35 ) while the  usual \" sw term plateaus ( hu &  sugiyama 1994 ) . as a consequence , going from the largest to slightly smaller angular scales , the ",
    "usual \" term rises steeply and then flattens , while the  integrated \" term rises less steeply and then drops ( i.e. , it has a peak ) .",
    "the change in shape , as a function of @xmath66 , of these two terms is both @xmath1 and @xmath58 dependent .",
    "these are the two dominant effects at @xmath67 ; at higher @xmath66 other effects come into play .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath68 the curvature length scale cutoff and the precise large - scale form of the @xmath58 considered here are relatively unimportant  the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum is quite similar to that for @xmath69 , and the dominant contribution is the  usual \" sw term . for a @xmath58 that does not diverge at low wavenumber , as with the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum in an open model , for @xmath70 the exponential  cutoff \" at the spatial curvature length dominates , and the lowest-@xmath66 @xmath56 s are suppressed ( figs . 3 and 5 ) . for this @xmath58 ,",

    "( in particular : we do not just account for the small systematic difference between the galactic- and ecliptic - frame maps ; we do not assume that any of the small systematic differences lead to model - independent systematic shifts in the inferred @xmath21 values ; and we do not add the systematic shifts in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty . )",

    "[ 19 ] . ) since part of this uncertainty is due to the small systematic shifts , the maximal 2-@xmath80 fractional uncertainty is smaller than twice the maximal 1-@xmath80 fractional uncertainty .",
    "for the largest possible 2-@xmath80 @xmath21 range defined above , the fractional uncertainty varies between @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "note that this accounts for intrinsic noise , cosmic variance , and effects ( 1)(3 ) above .",
    "other systematic effects , e.g. , the calibration uncertainty ( kogut et al .",
    "1996b ) , or the beamwidth uncertainty ( wright et al . 1994 ) , are much smaller than the effects we have accounted for here .",
    "it has also been shown that there is negligible non - cmb contribution to the dmr data sets from known extragalactic astrophysical foregrounds ( banday et al .",
    "1996b ) .",
    "by analyzing the dmr maps using cmb anisotropy spectra at fixed @xmath1 but different @xmath2 and @xmath10 , we have also explicitly quantified the small shifts in the inferred normalization amplitude due to shifts in @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "although these shifts do depend on the value of @xmath1 and the assumed model power spectrum , given the other uncertainties , it is reasonable to ignore these small shifts when normalizing the models considered in this work .",
    "we have analyzed the open - bubble inflation model , accounting only for the fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) , including the effects of the fluctuations generated in the first epoch of spatially - flat inflation ( bgt ; yst ) , and finally accounting for the contribution from a non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) . for observationally viable open - bubble models ,",
    "the observable predictions do not depend significantly on the latter two sources of anisotropy .",
    "the observable predictions of the open - bubble inflation scenario seem to be robust  it seems that only those fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble need to be accounted for .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a variety of more specific realizations of the open - bubble inflation scenario have recently come under scrutiny .",
    "these are based on specific assumptions about the vacuum state prior to open - bubble nucleation . in these specific realizations of the open - bubble inflation scenario",
    "there are a number of additional mechanisms for stress - energy perturbation generation ( in addition to those in the models considered here ) , including those that come from fluctuations in the bubble wall , as well as effects associated with the nucleation of a nonzero size bubble .",
    "while current analyses suggest that such effects also do not add a significant amount to the fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble , it is important to continue to pursue such investigations  both to more carefully examine the robustness of the open - bubble inflation scenario predictions , as well as to try to find a reasonable particle physics based realization of the open - bubble inflation scenario .    as has been previously noted for other cmb anisotropy angular spectra ( g96 ) , the various different dmr data sets lead to slightly different @xmath21 normalization amplitudes , but well within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "this total range is slightly reduced if one considers results from analyses either ignoring or including the quadrupole moment .",
    "the dmr data alone can not be used to constrain @xmath1 over range @xmath14 in a statistically meaningful fashion for the open models considered here .",
    "it is , however , reasonable to conclude that when the quadrupole moment is excluded from the analysis , the @xmath9 model cmb anisotropy spectral shape is most consistent with the dmr data , while the quadrupole - included analysis favours @xmath12 ( for the open - bubble inflation model in the range @xmath250 ) .",
    "current cosmographic observations , in conjunction with current large - scale structure observations compared to the predictions of the dmr - normalized open - bubble inflation model derived here , favour @xmath202 .",
    "the large allowed range is partially a consequence of the current uncertainty in @xmath10 .",
    "this range is consistent with the value weakly favoured ( @xmath9 ) by a quadrupole - excluded analysis of the dmr data alone .",
    "it might also be significant that mild bias is indicated both by the need to reconcile these larger values of @xmath1 with what is determined from small - scale dynamical estimates , as well as to reconcile the smaller dmr - normalized @xmath251 $ ] values ( for this favoured range of @xmath1 ) with the larger observed galaxy number fluctuations ( e.g. , eq . [ 18 ] ) .    in common with the low - density flat-@xmath18 cdm model",
    ", we have established that in the low - density open - bubble cdm model one may adjust the value of @xmath1 to accommodate a large fraction of present observational constraints . for a broad class of these models , with adiabatic gaussian initial energy - density perturbations , this focuses attention on values of @xmath1 that are larger than the range of values for @xmath10 inferred from the observed light - element abundances in conjunction with standard nucleosynthesis theory . whether this additional cdm is nonbaryonic , or is simply baryonic material that does not take part in standard nucleosynthesis , remains a major outstanding puzzle for these models .",
