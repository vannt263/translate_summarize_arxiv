    "<S> lett . * 82 * , 5181 ( 1999 ) ) that for weak enough interactions the pointer states are eigenstates of the central system .    </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly accepted that decoherence by nuclear spins is the main obstacle for realization of quantum computations in magnetic systems ; see , e.g. , discussions of specific silicon @xcite and carbon @xcite based quantum computers . therefore , understanding the decoherence in quantum spin systems is a subject of numerous works ( for a review , see refs .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the issue seems to be very complicated and despite many efforts , even some basic questions about character of the decoherence process are unsolved yet . </S>",
    "<S> most of the problems can not be solved analytically , in particular if there is more than one spin in the central system , but we can use the computer to simulate the dynamics and find useful information .    an unusual two - step decoherence was reported in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important phenomenon since it implies that , generally speaking , the observation of the rabi oscillations does not guarantee access to sectors of the hilbert space that may be essential for efficient quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> its origin is still poorly understood ; it was described analytically in a framework of an exactly solvable model of noninteracting spins in the bath @xcite but it is not clear how sensitive it is to the details of spin - spin interactions . in the real world , the environment has its own dynamics , which could be much slower or comparable to the central dynamics . first attempts to investigate numerically the effects of the environment dynamics @xcite did not lead to definite conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of an open quantum system crucially depends on the ratio of typical energy differences of the central system @xmath0 and the energy @xmath1 which characterizes the interaction of the central system with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath2 has been studied extensively in relation to the `` schrdinger cat '' problem and the physics is quite clear   @xcite : as a result of time evolution , the central system passes to one of the `` pointer states ''  @xcite which , in this case , are the eigenstates of the interaction hamiltonian . the opposite case , @xmath3 is less well understood . </S>",
    "<S> there is a conjecture that in this case the pointer states should be eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the central system , but this is proven only for a very simple model  @xcite . on the other hand , this case is of primary interest if , say , the central system consists of electron spins whereas the environment are nuclear spins ( e.g. , if one considers the possibility of quantum computation using molecular magnets @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as we will show , the selection of an eigenstate as the pointer state is also determined by the state and the dynamics of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> elsewhere  @xcite , we have already shown that if the environment is a spin glass and initially in the ground state , then independent of the initial state of the central system , the central system relaxes to a state that is very close to its ground state : the ground state is selected as the point state of the central system . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a realistic model of decoherence of a system of two spins by an environment of nuclear spins at elevated temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate that the decoherence of the central system depends in a significant , nonintuitive manner on the details of the dynamics of the environment .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a generic quantum spin model described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the hamiltonians of the central system , the environment , and the interaction between the central system and the environment , respectively . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) , the exchange integrals @xmath6 and @xmath7 determine the strength of the interaction between spins @xmath8 of the central system @xmath9 , and the spins @xmath10 in the environment @xmath11 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange integrals @xmath12 control the interaction @xmath13 of the central system with its environment . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) , the sum over @xmath14 runs over the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 components of spin-@xmath18 operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in the sequel </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the term `` heisenberg - like '' @xmath11 to indicate that each @xmath7 is a uniform random number in the range @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 being a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider two different kinds of @xmath13 , namely rotational invariant heisenberg interactions @xmath23 and `` ising - like '' interactions for which @xmath24 and @xmath25 are dichotomic random variables , taking the values @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , if @xmath13 is `` ising like '' , the total magnetization of the central system ( @xmath27 ) is a conserved quantity . as we demonstrate in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , the connectivity of the spins in the environment affects the decoherence in a nontrivial manner . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize this connectivity by the number @xmath28 , the number of environment spins with which a spin in the environment interacts . if @xmath29 , each spin in the environment interacts with the central system only . if @xmath30 , the structure of the environment is assumed to be that of a ring , that is each spin in the environment interacts with two other spins only . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond environments in which the spins are placed on a square or triangular lattice , respectively and interact with nearest - neighbors only . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath33 , each spin in the environment interacts with all the other spins in the environment and , to give this case a name , we will refer to this case as `` spin glass '' . if the hamiltonian of the central system @xmath9 is a perturbation , relative to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath13 , the pointer states are eigenstates of @xmath13  @xcite . in the opposite case , that is the regime @xmath34 that we explore in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the pointer states are supposed to be eigenstates of @xmath9  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are given by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , satisfying @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> to check this conjecture is one of the main aims of our simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulation procedure is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we generate a random superposition @xmath42 of all the basis states of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> this state corresponds to the equilibrium density matrix of the environment at infinite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - up  spin - down state ( @xmath43 ) is taken as the initial state of the central system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the initial state of the whole system reads @xmath44 and is a product state of the state of the central system and the random state of the environment which , in general is a ( very complicated ) linear combination of the @xmath45 basis states of the environment . in our simulations </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath46 which , from earlier work  @xcite , we know is sufficiently large for the environment to behave as a `` large '' system . for a given , fixed set of model parameters , the time evolution of the whole system </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the many - body wave function @xmath47 , describing the central system plus the environment . the numerical method that we use </S>",
    "<S> is described in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> it conserves the energy of the whole system to machine precision . </S>",
    "<S> we monitor the effects of the decoherence by plotting the time dependence of the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix of the central system . </S>",
    "<S> as explained earlier , in the regime of interest @xmath48 , the pointer states are the eigenstates of the central systems , hence we compute the matrix elements of the density matrix in the basis of eigenvectors of the central system .     </S>",
    "<S> ( left panel ) and the diagonal elements @xmath49 ( right panel ) of the reduced density matrix of a central system ( with @xmath50 ) , interacting with a heisenberg - like environment @xmath11 ( with @xmath51 ) via an isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath13 ( with @xmath52 ) for different connectivity numbers @xmath28 of the spins in the environment : ( a ) @xmath29 ; ( b ) @xmath30 ; ( c ) @xmath31 ; ( d ) @xmath32 ; ( e ) @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute values of the off - diagonal elements @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are less than 0.002 ( results not shown ) . , width=340 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we show the time evolution of the elements of the reduced density matrix of the central system for different connectivity numbers @xmath28 with isotropic heisenberg interactions between the central system and the spins in the environment . we conclude that :    1 .   in agreement with earlier work  @xcite , we find that in the absence of interactions between the environment spins ( @xmath29 ) and after the initial fast decay , the central system exhibits long - time oscillations ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a)(left ) ) . in this case and in the limit of a large environment </S>",
    "<S> , we have  @xcite @xmath58 \\cos \\omega t , \\frac{(1-bt^{2 } ) e^{-ct^{2}}}{3}\\right ] \\cos \\omega t , \\label{melik}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ melik ] ) clearly shows the two - step process , that is , after the initial gaussian decay of the amplitude of the oscillations , the oscillations revive and their amplitude levels of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that because of conservation laws , this behavior does not change if the environment is described by an isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian ( @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , whatever the value of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> if , as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we take @xmath66 $ ] random instead of the same , the amplitude of the long - living oscillations is no longer constant but decays very slowly  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   the presence of heisenberg - like ( non - isotropic , random ) interactions between the spins of the environment leads to a reduction and a decay of the amplitude of the long - living oscillations ( see fig .  [ fig1](b - e)(left ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the connectivity number @xmath28 , the faster is the decay of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath28 reaches its maximum @xmath33 ( spin glass ) , the second step in the decoherence process is no longer separated from the initial decay . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it seems as if it has merged with the final stage of the first step ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e)(left ) ) . for @xmath33 , the time evolution of @xmath67 can be fitted well by the function @xmath68 \\cos \\omega ' t , \\frac{(1-b't^{2 } ) e^{-c't^{2}}}{3}\\right ] \\cos \\omega ' t,\\ ] ] with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for comparison , the values that enter eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ melik ] ) are @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to note that if the dynamics of the environment is sufficiently slow ( @xmath76 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , this dynamics apparently does not affect the decoherence of the central spins  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the effectiveness of the decoherence process not only depends on @xmath28 but also on the details of the interactions within the environment . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .    according to the general picture of decoherence  @xcite , for an environment with nontrivial internal dynamics that initially is in a random superposition of all its eigenstates </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the central system will evolve to a stable mixture of its eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the decoherence will cause all the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix to vanish with time . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the weight of the degenerate eigenstates @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 in this mixed state are expected to be the same . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b - e)(right ) , our simulations confirm that this picture is correct in all respects . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the results depicted in fig .  [ fig1](b - e)(right ) demonstrate that the connectivity number @xmath28 has no effect on the value of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for long times .     of the reduced density matrix of a central system ( with @xmath84 ) , </S>",
    "<S> interacting with a heisenberg - like environment @xmath11 ( with @xmath51 ) via an ising - like hamiltonian @xmath13 ( with @xmath85 ) for different connectivity numbers @xmath28 of the spins in the environment : ( a ) @xmath29 ; ( b ) @xmath30 ; ( c ) @xmath31 ; ( d ) @xmath32 ; ( e ) @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> , width=340 ]    .frequency of oscillation @xmath86 and decoherence time @xmath87 for different connectivity @xmath28 . in case 1 and case 2 </S>",
    "<S> , for each @xmath28 , the values of @xmath88 are the same but the values of @xmath89 are different . in case 2 and case 3 , for each @xmath28 , the values of @xmath89 are the same but the values of @xmath88 are different . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we change the interactions between central system and the spins in the environment from heisenberg - like to ising - like but keep the interactions between different spins in the environment heisenberg - like . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in our simulations , the hamiltonian @xmath11 is the same for both cases . </S>",
    "<S> as explained earlier , in the ising - like case , the total magnetization of the central system is conserved during the time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as the initial state of the central system is @xmath90 , at any time @xmath91 the state of the whole system can be written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote the states of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , only @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 can be nonzero .    on general grounds </S>",
    "<S> , we may expect that the presence of an additional conservation law slows down the decoherence and indeed , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , this is the case . note that the results of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] have been obtained for @xmath84 instead of for @xmath50 , the value used to compute the results shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( the latter value was chosen to facilitate the comparison with the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , but this factor of five in the value of @xmath6 can not account for the large difference in the observed decoherence times .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , we conclude that    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> we never observe the two - step process that we find in the case of heisenberg - like @xmath13 . for @xmath29 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ) , there is no decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   for @xmath99 , @xmath100 vanishes with time , in agreement with the general picture of decoherence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , quite unexpectedly , the rate of decoherence _ increases _ with @xmath28 , in contrast to the case of heisenberg @xmath13 in which the rate of decoherence decreases with @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the data presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b - d ) can all be fitted very well by @xmath101 where @xmath102 and the values of @xmath103 depend on @xmath28 . in table </S>",
    "<S> [ table2 ] , we give some typical results for these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> cases 1 and 2 illustrate that ( random ) changes in @xmath13 may affect the value of the decoherence time @xmath103 significantly but the general trend , the increase of @xmath103 with @xmath28 seems generic .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that ( 1 ) the pure quantum state of the central spin system evolves into the classical , mixed state , and ( 2 ) if the interaction between the central system and environment is much smaller than the coupling between the spins in the central system , the pointer states are the eigenstates of the central system . </S>",
    "<S> both these observations are in concert with the general picture of decoherence  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have demonstrated that , in the case that the environment is a spin system , the details of this spin system are important for the decoherence of the central system . in particular , we have shown that ( 1 ) changing the internal dynamics of the environment may change the qualitative features of the decoherence of the central spin system , and that ( 2 ) the dependence of the decoherence time of the central spin system on the connectivity of the interactions between spins of the environment is counterintuitive . </S>"
