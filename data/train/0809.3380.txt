    "m8 consists of a rich open cluster with several o - type stars and a prominent hii region ( about half a degree in diameter ) , the core of the cluster superimposed on the eastern half of the hii region .",
    "the hii region is surrounded by bright rims and at least one dark ` elephant trunk ' structure ; these are most prominent at the southeastern edge of the hii region .",
    "a dark lane splits the optical nebula from ne to sw ( the ` great rift ' ) ; the lack of background stars in the rift implies that it is an obscuring dust lane rather than a lack of material , but it does not show up clearly in submillimetre- or millimetre - wave maps , either of spectral lines of co or of the dust continuum ; the rift presumably has a high enough column density to obscure optical wavelengths significantly , but not enough to be obvious in emission .",
    "the open cluster is fairly young ( a few myr ) .",
    "it is centred on 18:04:24 , 24:21:12 ( j2000.0 ) , with a radius of around 30 , but a core radius of only @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "it contains several o stars and about 60 b stars : one of its probable members , the o4 star ( and probable binary , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 9sagittarii , is the chief source of ionising flux for the hii region .",
    "the western half of the hii region is concentrated into a bright core which contains the hourglass nebula , a distinctively - shaped window into a compact hii region with much denser ionised gas than the main body of the lagoon nebula , powered by the young o7 star herschel  36 ( hd  164740 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    southeast of the cluster core , a structure of bright rims and dark lanes stretches west to east .",
    "co and dust maps clearly show this to be a dense molecular cloud ; at its eastern end , at least two massive stars are being formed in the optically - invisible m8e cluster which rivals the brightness of the hourglass at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths ( see fig .  [ fig - irac ] ) .",
    "the nomenclature of nebulae and clusters in the area is quite unclear , since the complex has been observed and catalogued since the 17th century @xcite . according to the ngc / ic project , ngc6533 refers to the whole nebula and ngc6523 is the bright core of the nebula , lying nw of the great rift ; the se part of the nebula comprises ngc6526 in the south and ngc6530 in the north ; and ic1271 and 4678 are small condensations to the east of the main nebula ( ic1271 may refer to the o star hd165052 ) .",
    "although messier referred to it as _ ` amas ' _ , a cluster ( m8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we will use m8 to refer to the whole complex of stars , hii regions and molecular gas , and ` lagoon nebula ' to be synonymous .",
    "the ne of the region is dominated by the open cluster , so ngc6530 is now always used to refer to the cluster rather than any surrounding nebulosity .",
    "we take ngc6533 to refer to the hii region only , comprising ngc6523 and 6526 .",
    "hii region studies have generally concentrated on the brighter eastern core ( i.e.  ngc6523 ) , and so it is this designation that is found in the literature : for most practical purposes , ngc6533 and 6523 are the same .",

    "finally , we briefly discuss the structure and evolution of the region as a whole ( sect .",
    "[ sec - discussion ] ) .",
    "the hii region is about 10  pc in radius and requires about @xmath10 ionising photons per second ; 9sgr appears to be its principal source of ionising radiation , with the binary hd165052 ( o6.5v + o7.5v ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contributing as well .",
    "optical spectroscopy suggests that the bulk of the ionised gas has electron temperature ( @xmath11 ) about 6000  k @xcite , and electron density @xmath12500  @xmath13 increasing to a few @xmath14  @xmath13 in small condensations and bright rims @xcite . both density and temperature increase towards the centre of the hii region .",
    "@xcite identified the star herschel36 as being responsible for ionising the core of the nebula , an area about 4  across ; it also ionises the hourglass nebula , embedded behind this core .",
    "the hourglass is even hotter and denser , with @xmath15 of 20004000  @xmath13 and @xmath11 of 70009000  k , and fluctuations of about 1500  k @xcite .",
    "ngc6523/33 seems to be a cavity on the front of a large molecular cloud ; the optical emission comes from the working surface of ionisation fronts moving into a clumpy medium ( fig .",

    "@xcite tentatively detected ionised gas moving at @xmath550  km / s , between us and the nebula , and uv absorptions due to ionised gas were found at about 30 and 50  km / s @xcite .",
    "the stellar wind of 9sgr alone would be enough to drive the 50  km / s shell @xcite , although other o - stars probably contribute .",
    "the ionised gas in the lagoon nebula may be considered as a superposition of four hii regions : the hourglass , the core of ngc6523 ( both powered by herschel36 ) , the rest of ngc6523 and 6533 ( ionised by 9sgr ) , and the largest and most tenuous component , ionised by hd165052 @xcite .",

    "courtesy richard crisp . ]",
    "although the core of ngc6530 lies on the line of sight towards a concentration of molecular gas , the cluster is rather decoupled from the molecular cloud  the stars seem to be unobscured , and @xcite showed that the far - ir luminosity of m8 is significantly less than the integrated light of an incomplete census of ob stars in the cluster ; hence , the cluster is not significantly embedded in the molecular gas .",
    "optical studies all show significant and variable reddening towards the stars , indicating that there is some interstellar material in front of the cluster .",
    "@xcite noted that a shell of expanding gas is seen in absorption against the stars @xcite , implying that ngc6530 lies within the hii cavity .",
    "however , this result is based on uv spectra of 4 ob stars ; membership probabilities for 3 of them are 0.01 , 0.08 , and 0.39 @xcite , so this argument is not conclusive .",
    "the surface density of cluster stars , derived from x - ray data @xcite , shows a compact core about 10  across , surrounded by a broad extended component to the southeast , south and west . to the northeast",
    ", the surface density of x - ray sources falls off very quickly , and there is a secondary density peak to the southeast , near the m8e star - forming region .",
    "many optical studies of the cluster , however , include stars within a field of about a degree , many of which are probable cluster members , based on proper motion @xcite .",
    "the cluster includes at least 3 o - type stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - dss - annot ] ) : the binary hd165052 , probable binary 9  sagittarii , and herschel  36 .",
    "hd164816 and hd164906 ( also known as mwc280 ) are usually classified as o - type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the approximate centre of ngc6530 is annotated , as are the hourglass nebula , m8e , and the brightest stars . ]",
    "studies of the stellar population of ngc6530 can be used to estimate the age and distance of the cluster and thus to characterise the star formation history of the region , and , by isolating the pre - main sequence , the young stellar population may be studied .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the stellar population of ngc6530 from foreground and background stars , since it lies close to the galactic plane , and is projected on top of the galactic bulge .",
    "most studies of the cluster have been carried out with broadband optical photometry , and newer studies have extended the photometry into the near - ir .",
    "it is then possible to isolate the cluster in a statistical sense , e.g.  as a separate population in a colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "detailed studies of the young stars require individual stars to be identified as being young .",
    "historically , this has usually involved looking for h@xmath0 emission , but modern x - ray imaging with xmm-_newton _ and the acis - i camera on _ chandra _ @xcite are a much more efficient way to identify young stars in the cluster : the x - ray to bolometric flux of t  tauri stars is at least 100 times higher than it is for most of the foreground and background stars which dominate optical and infrared images .",
    "earlier - type stars in the cluster are likely to lie on the zams already , and may not show up in h@xmath0 or x - ray emission .",
    "one of the few possible methods for identifying individual early - type cluster members is through proper motion analysis , which relies on the availability of old data .",
    "fortunately , these early - type stars are rather bright , and thus quite likely to be visible on old photographic plates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    quite apart from foreground contamination ( in the optical ) and background contamination ( in the near - ir )",
    ", we face the problem that there are signs of multiple populations of ysos in the m8 region .",
    "near - ir and x - ray imaging both suggest that there are small dense clusters associated with the hourglass nebula , with m8e ( both regions of ongoing massive star formation ) , and possibly with the central ridge . disentangling these very young clusters from ngc6530",
    "is likely to be difficult .",
    "the large - scale structure of the molecular ism in the lagoon can be seen in maps of co 10 @xcite and far - ir continuum emission @xcite , both with resolutions of 12 .",
    "@xcite found 3 bright spots , bs13 : the most prominent ( bs1 ) corresponds to the inner core of the hii region , centred on the hourglass ( clump hg and surroundings in fig .",
    "[ fig - submm ] ) ; bs2 ( sc8 and surroundings in fig .",
    "[ fig - submm ] ) lies at the southern edge of the nebula , coincident with the ` south eastern bright rim ' ( an ionisation front eroding a concentration of gas ) .",
    "bs3 lies on the western edge of the core of ngc6530 : the continuum map shows it as an elongated structure , or ` eastern bar ' ( which we call the ` central ridge ' , clumps ec15 in fig .",
    "[ fig - submm ] ) .",
    "@xcite also found a co cloud with significantly redder velocity ( 28 km / s ) lying between the core of ngc6530 and the bright rim linking the lagoon nebula to m8e .",
    "a near - ir extinction map with comparable resolution shows very similar structure @xcite .",
    "maps of the molecular ism ( submillimetre continuum and low-@xmath17 co ) covering a similar area to those of @xcite , but with resolution of order 10  were published by @xcite ; some of the maps are shown in figure  [ fig - submm ] .",
    "the molecular emission is clearly dominated by the hourglass and m8e , but many other concentrations become visible .",
    "bs2 ( and the sebr ) can now be resolved as a clump of gas ( sc8 ) with a very sharp transition from the molecular gas to the ionised gas of the hii region , consistent with the picture of a structure dominated by the progess of an ionisation front . the central ridge ( bs3 ) , by contrast , shows up as a complex extended structure of molecular material ( ec15 ) running approximately n  s , without the sharp edges seen in the former .",
    "it is possible that this complex has a similar ionisation structure , but that we observe it face on , the ionisation front covering the whole of the complex , rather than seeing a cross - section as with the southern rim . in the central ridge ,",
    "the brightest continuum emission is seen in a compact condensation at the northern end , while the co emission peaks further south along the extended ridge .",
    "this may reflect structural differences , with a dense but relatively cool clump at the northern end of the warmer , more diffuse ridge .",
    "the lower - resolution continuum data showed a western extension of the hourglass emission @xcite , and the newer data resolve this into a series of clumps running wnw from the hourglass , also seen in molecular data @xcite .",
    "the hourglass nebula and m8e are known to be regions of very recent or ongoing star formation .",
    "the central ridge lies close to a cluster of x - ray sources , suggesting that it too is a locus of star formation within the lagoon nebula .",
    "the ionisation - dominated structure of bs2/m8sc8 should also be considered a candidate for star formation , possibly triggered by the compression of the molecular gas by the ionisation front .",
    "in addition , there are many other molecular clumps scattered throughout the nebula .",
    "most of them are not particularly dense , but @xcite suggested that star formation might be triggered in them by the effect of ionisation fronts ( based on the assumed ionising flux from 9sgr and herschel  36 ) .",
    "@xcite studied a dark ` elephant trunk ' structure ( which they call ` the dragon ' ) lying south of the ridge that connects m8se1 to m8e ( see fig .  [ fig - irac ] ) , using stellar intensity profiles to model the cloud as a @xmath18  pc structure of density a few @xmath14  @xmath13 , and total mass @xmath19  m@xmath20 .",
    "the dragon can also be seen in the 850  @xmath3 m continuum @xcite as a very faint structure just visible over the noise .",
    "based purely on its position , it would seem to lie outside and in front of the arc of dense gas seen in the submillimeter continuum .",
    "the question of whether or not the dragon is associated with star formation remains open .",
    "in the course of a larger survey of high - mass protostar candidates , @xcite mapped the m8 area at 1.3  mm wavelength with a beam about twice the size of that of @xcite .",
    "the structure seen in their map is similar , and their published brightnesses are comparable to those seen at 1.3  mm in the earlier study .",
    "table  [ tab - submm ] lists the clumps seen in the two studies , cross - referenced where possible . @xcite also examined the msx images , and found that all of the clumps in their map are associated with mid - ir emission , almost all of them with point sources .",
    "the clump masses derived by @xcite are systematically higher than those from @xcite , by up to 2 orders of magnitude ( averaging about a factor of 10 ) .",
    "this very large discrepancy can be explained by a combination of factors : @xcite often find larger fluxes from a clump the most extreme example is the hourglass clump ( m8hg / clump  1 ) with 1.3  mm fluxes of 2.6 and 14  jy measured by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "these larger fluxes reflect the larger beamsize of the later observations and the use of clumpfind to decompose the maps into clumps .",
    "clumpfind packs all the flux in the map above a certain limit into the various clumps it finds , whereas decomposition into gaussian clumps ( used by @xcite ) tends to leave residual flux .",
    "there are further discrepancies , due to differences in the conversion from continuum flux to gas mass between the two papers . for m8 ,",
    "@xcite use @xmath21 , whereas @xcite use a range of about @xmath22 .",
    "this difference arises from assumptions about the mm - wave opacity of dust ( 1  @xmath23  g@xmath24 against 1.3  @xmath23  g@xmath24 ) , the temperature of the dust , and the distance to m8 .",
    "@xcite assume a temperature of 30  k for all clumps , while @xcite derive individual clump temperatures from co observations . since the mass / flux ratio is inversely proportional to the temperature ( in the rayleigh - jeans limit ) , this is not a large effect , but can reach almost a factor of two : for the hourglass , @xcite adopted a temperature of 48  k. by comparing the velocity of cs emission to a galactic rotation curve , @xcite estimated the distance to m8 to be 3.1  kpc , compared to the 1.7  kpc assumed by @xcite since the mass - to - flux ratio is proportional to the square of the distance adopted , this produces a discrepancy in mass of more than a factor of 3 .",
    "the combination of all these discrepancies is enough to account for the differences in the mass estimates .",
    "the distance adopted by @xcite is inconsistent with the accepted range ( see later in this review ) , and the distance adopted by @xcite is also a bit further than the most likely current estimate of 1.3kpc .",
    "the gas masses quoted in table  [ tab - submm ] have been rescaled to a fiducial distance of 1.3kpc ; remaining discrepancies reflect the uncertainties in the absolute derivation of mass from dust emission .",

    "the measurement is based on only 7 stars ; since they are presumably rather bright , it is entirely possible that they are all foreground stars .",
    "@xcite were able to fit a straight line to the relationship between distance moduli determined from _ hipparcos _ data and those determined photometrically , but the ngc6530 measurement is inconsistent with that straight line ; moreover , they consider 1  kpc to be the greatest distance at which their technique is accurate . in the absence of more detailed results , this distance estimate should not be adopted .",
    "most recent distance determinations agree on a distance of about 1.3  kpc , which is used throughout this review .",
    "the @xcite estimate of 1.8  kpc is based only on early - type stars for which a spectral type was known : essentially , they fitted a zams to the top ( the blue end ) of the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "as @xcite point out , the blue end of the zams is almost vertical on a colour - magnitude diagram , so the distance modulus ( a vertical offset on the diagram ) is not very well - constrained . by contrast ,",
    "@xcite , by fitting to the blue envelope , are able to use the redder part of the zams to constrain the distance modulus , at the cost of the additional assumption that the blue edge of the colour - magnitude diagram constitutes the cluster , or field stars at the same distance .",
    "@xcite , by using the modified q - method , were also able to use fainter stars without spectroscopic data , and in fact used the photometric data from @xcite to derive their nearer distance .",
    "the @xcite estimate ( also 1.8  kpc ) is similarly dependent on rather bright stars .",
    "however , the differences in stellar samples used for the various distance determinations may not be the whole story : @xcite found a distance modulus of 11.2  mag towards herschel  36 , while @xcite estimated 10.5  mag . both determinations used the same observed magnitude ( @xmath263 ) , and their assumed absolute magnitudes only differ by 0.1 ; the rest of the discrepancy presumably lies in the assumptions used to deredden the @xmath236-band data .",
    "herschel  36 is probably an extreme example , as it is known to have anomalous extinction , but it illustrates some of the problems that bedevil distance estimation .",
    "most of these distance estimates are variations on fitting a zams to a colour - magnitude diagram , but the two recent works which use independent methods find different distances . as noted above , we do not consider the parallax measurement @xcite to be sufficiently accurate to be useful , but the asteroseismology of pms pulsating stars @xcite raises some intriguing possibilities .",
    "@xcite assumed a distance of 1.8  kpc in their analysis , and found well - fitting models .",
    "it is unclear to us whether or not they could have assumed a distance of 1.3  kpc and still have modelled the cluster stars successfully .",
    "the stars whose oscillations were modelled were selected because they lay on the instability strip of the hr diagram at an assumed distance of 1.8  kpc @xcite , and it might be useful to search for pulsating stars outside this region , since the position of the instability strip on a colour - magnitude diagram could add additional distance constraints .",
    "further distance estimates could perhaps be obtained from spectroscopy of known intermediate- and low - mass cluster members ( selected by further proper motion studies , x - ray emission , h@xmath0 emission , ir excess etc ) .",
