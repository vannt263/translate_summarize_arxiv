    "the barred spiral galaxy ngc1097 has an active nucleus classified as liner ( low - ionization nuclear emission - line region , @xcite ) , whose spectrum was found in 1991 to show transient broad ( fwhm@xmath310,000kms@xmath1 ) double - peaked balmer lines @xcite .",
    "the nucleus of ngc1097 was the first low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) in a liner discovered displaying such lines , and , because of these broad lines , has also been classified as a seyfert1 nucleus .",
    "later , other llagns in liner nuclei were found to display double - peaked balmer lines , such as m81 @xcite , ngc 4203 @xcite , and ngc 4450 @xcite .",
    "the double - peaked h@xmath2 profile of the ngc1097 nucleus was monitored for the following 11 years after the discovery @xcite ( sb03 ) , showing variability in its flux , width and relative intensity of the blue and red peaks .",
    "these variations were attributed to gas emission from a thin keplerian accretion disk , with a non - axisymmetric perturbation around a supermassive black hole ( hereafter smbh ) , where the gas is ionized by a central source , @xcite .",
    "the variability of the double - peaked profile of ngc1097 is not rare .",
    "the first active nucleus found to display variable double - peaked broad balmer emission lines was the nucleus of the radio galaxy 3c390.3 @xcite .",
    "this object can be considered prototypical of the class of double - peaked emitters , because many of the now well - known features of these objects , such as variability in the relative intensity of the blue and red peaks @xcite , were first observed in 3c390.3 .",
    "another remarkably well studied double - peaked emitter is the active nucleus of arp102b . for this object",
    ", a study by @xcite has shown that the double - peaked balmer lines can not be driven by local viscous dissipation in the line - emitting part of the disk , as the h@xmath2 luminosity is of the order or even exceeds the energy locally available to power the line .",
    "the same conclusion was obtained for other double - peaked emitters by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors suggested that the lines are powered by illumination from an external source .",
    "the ionizing source could be an geometrically thick accretion flow , located within the inner radius of the line - emitting portion of the disk . in the case of ngc1097",
    ", @xcite found that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the nucleus is indeed well described by such a structure , a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf , @xcite ) .",
    "this has led to the conclusion that an inner riaf is the ionizing source of the accretion disk in ngc1097 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported a long - term monitoring of 14 other double - peaked emitters and found similar variations to those observed for ngc1097 , 3c390.3 and arp102b .",
    "these objects also display in at least one epoch the red peak more intense than the blue peak .",
    "this indicates that most line - emitting disks are non - axisymmetric , as in an axisymmetric disk the blue peak should be always more intense than the red because of doppler boosting .",
    "the disks could then be elliptical @xcite , or have a non - axisymmetric emitting structure , such as a hot spot or spiral arm @xcite .",
    "another model which can reproduce double - peaked emission - line profiles is the one proposed by @xcite and @xcite , in which the ionizing source is the continuum from a thin accretion disk , and the origin of the double - peaked lines is the broad - line region ( blr ) which is proposed to be an inner extension of the torus , in the shape of a `` bird s nest '' .",
    "this geometry is not that distinct from that of the outer parts of an accretion disk , and in this regard is in approximate agreement with our proposed geometry .",
    "but , in the case of ngc1097 , the study by @xcite favors an riaf origin for the nuclear ionizing continuum instead of a hot and thin accretion disk .",
    "the monitoring of double - peaked profiles is a valuable experiment in the investigation of the structure and dynamics of the accretion disks and how they evolve as the gas moves inwards to feed the smbh . in @xcite , observing the ngc1097 h@xmath2 double - peaked profile approximately once or twice a year , we concluded that the asymmetry of the double - peaked profile was due to a spiral arm perturbation in the disk , rotating with a period of 5.5 years .",
    "but as relevant timescales for evolution of the innermost regions of agns can be as short as weeks and months , we decided to repeat our experiment on ngc1097 in order to probe shorter timescales . here",
    "we report the results of this experiment : we indeed found short variability timescales .",
    "we also verified that , although our last observations of 2001 showed that the profile was becoming fainter and fainter , it is now again strong and was even stronger in 2010 december than in all previous observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the observations and the data reduction in section 3 we present the observational results , in section 4 we describe the models and the results from the modeling . in section 5",
    "we discuss the timescales of the accretion disk variability and the interpretation of the modeling .",
    "the conclusions of this work are presented in section 6 .",
    "long - slit optical spectra of the nucleus of ngc 1097 were obtained in queue mode in 11 epochs from 2010 march 4 to 2011 march 21 using the gemini south multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) in the long - slit mode .",
    "the allocation was part of the `` poor weather '' opportunity , which is ideal for spectral monitoring which does not need absolute flux calibration or regular cadence .",
    "this is the case for the nucleus of ngc1097 , for which we use the integrated flux in the narrow emission lines to normalize the spectra to match previous observations , under the assumption that the narrow lines do not vary within the extraction aperture .",
    "the first three observations were obtained at time intervals of 4 - 5 months , since our previous monitoring suggested significant variations on a timescale of years . however , our new observations showed strong variations in the nuclear spectrum on timescales of months , which motivated us to ask for new observations at shorter time intervals .",
    "we were then able to get at least two observations a month from 2011 january to 2011 march , as shown in the observing log presented in table [ obslog ] .",
    "this table lists the identification of the program , date of observation , position angle ( p.a . ) of the slit and the average seeing during the observations , measured as the fwhm of a spatial profile extracted along a range of columns containing only the broad line ( after subtraction of the underlying continuum ) .",
    "the data were obtained with the gmos south with a slit width of 1@xmath40 ( @xmath5pc ) , using the b600 grating and the gg455 filter to block possible higher order contamination .",
    "the spectral range covered was 60007000 for most spectra , at a spectral resolution of @xmath0 4.5(fwhm of the lines in the arc spectrum , @xmath6 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "six 600s exposures were obtained at each epoch , which were then combined into a final spectrum .",

    "using the same slit width allows us to normalize the new spectra so that they match the flux of the narrow emission lines observed in previous spectra and study the evolution of the flux and profile of the broad h@xmath2 line over @xmath320yr .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the standard tasks from the _ gmos _ package in the image reduction and analysis facility software ( iraf ) .",
    "we extracted the nuclear spectra using a window of 1@xmath40 @xmath71@xmath40 centered at the peak of the continuum emission , assumed to correspond to the galaxy nucleus .",
    "this position coincides also with the location of the unresolved source of the double - peaked h@xmath2 lines .",
    "figure [ acquisition ] shows the acquisition image of the observation of 2010 august 15 , where the nuclear extraction region is represented by the square labeled a.      since the nuclear spectra show strong absorption lines from the underlying stellar population , we subtracted the stellar population contribution , in order to isolate and better study the emission line profile and in particular the broad h@xmath2 line .",
    "a template stellar population spectrum was obtained as follows . for each epoch , in addition to the nuclear spectrum , we extracted two more spectra using two similar windows of 1@xmath40@xmath71@xmath40 , one centered at 1@xmath45 to the southwest ( figure [ acquisition ] , region b ) and another at 1@xmath45 to the northeast of the nucleus ( figure [ acquisition ] , region c ) . these extranuclear spectra do not show any broad h@xmath2 emission , but show some narrow - line emission which was edited out , using as guides , stellar population templates from previous studies @xcite .",
    "averaging these two spectra , we obtain a stellar population spectrum from a location approximately 100pc away from the nucleus . under the assumption that this spectrum is representative of the stellar population at the nucleus , we subtracted it from the nuclear spectrum ( after normalizing the continuum to the corresponding value at the nucleus ) thus isolating the gas emission .",
    "figure [ exemp1 ] illustrates the process for the spectrum of 2010 august 15 , which covers a broader spectral range than most spectra , from 4750 to 7200 .",
    "we note that this process reveals the presence of a broad double - peaked h@xmath8 line which was not obvious prior to the subtraction , as well as some weak emission lines such as [ ni]@xmath95199and [ oi]@xmath96363 .",

    "middle : stellar population obtained from averaging the spectra from regions b and c in figure [ acquisition ] .",
    "bottom : nuclear spectrum after the subtraction of the stellar population . ]",
    "we also note that after subtracting the stellar population spectrum from the nuclear one , we do not see any evidence for a significant contribution of an agn continuum , as can be seen in figure [ exemp1 ] .",
    "the effect of a nuclear continuum , if present , would be to dilute the stellar absorption lines , making them shallower at the nucleus than outside .",
    "the subtraction of the stellar population template , as described above , after normalization to the flux in the continuum of the nuclear spectrum would result in the presence of `` fake '' emission features in the residual spectrum and a possible slope ( in the case of a blue continuum , for example ) , which are not seen .",
    "we have performed a sequence of tests in order to estimate the contribution from a featureless continuum ( fc ) that could be `` hidden '' in the nuclear spectrum as follows .",
    "we added the contribution of the fc , assumed in the form @xmath10 , to the stellar population template described above , at increasing percent contributions of its flux at 5800 .",
    "the resulting composite ( fc+stellar population ) spectrum was then renormalized to the same flux at 5800 , and we subtracted the stellar population template from it .",
    "we concluded that for the short wavelength range and the signal - to - noise ratio of our observations , in order to have clear residuals showing fake emission features and a blue continuum we need the fc continuum to contribute with at least 15%20% of the flux at 5800 .",
    "we thus can say that a possible fc contribution to the nuclear spectrum is lower than 20% of the continuum flux at 5800 .",
    "we consider this value an upper limit , as a comparison between the stellar continuum from our spectra and the agn continuum obtained in the work of nemmen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) shows that the stellar continuum in our aperture is about 30 times stronger than the agn continuum in the optical .",
    "after subtracting the contribution of the stellar population , the final step before the analysis of the double - peaked profile was to normalize the spectra using as reference a previous flux - calibrated spectrum .",
    "we used as reference the spectrum of 1991 november 2 @xcite , and assumed that the flux of the narrow lines h@xmath2 , [ nii]@xmath116548 , 6584 , and [ sii]@xmath126717 , 6731 did not vary during the last 20 years .",
    "this is a common assumption in this type of study , as the narrow lines originate in extended regions with spatial scales much larger ( @xmath0 100pc ) than that of the accretion disk ( @xmath13pc ) .",
    "thus , their response time to variations in the ionizing flux is correspondingly much larger than that for the line - emitting accretion disk , and can not respond to variations of the ionizing flux that are as fast as those we have detected .",
    "the normalized spectra from our 201011 observations are compared with the reference spectrum of 1991 november in figure[results ] ( pairs of spectra are shifted from each other in the vertical direction for clarity ) . in this figure",
    "we show the three spectra from 2011 january , the three from 2011 february , and the two from 2011 march , respectively , on top of each other because we did not find any significant variation within each group .",
    "note that the double - peaked h@xmath2 profile from 2010 august is very different from that of 2010 march . in 2010",
    "march , the red peak was stronger than the blue peak , while in 2010 august , the blue peak was stronger than the red .",
    "this inversion of the relative intensity of the peaks occurred on a timescale of 5 months .",
    "in addition , in 2010 december , the profile showed a marked increase in its integrated flux compared to that of 2010 august , while the red and blue peaks showed similar strengths .    from 2010 december 22 to 2011 january 11 we observed a @xmath025% decrease in the integrated flux of the double - peaked profile .",
    "the three observations of 2011 january were obtained within a time interval of seven days , and showed no significant variations .    in 2011 february , the three observations were obtained within a time interval of six days , and again we did not see significant variations among the three profiles .",
    "however , the total flux continued to decrease compared with that of january , with the blue and red peaks showing similar strengths .    in 2011 march , we obtained two observations separated by a time interval of four days , between which we again did not find significant variation in the double - peaked profile .",
    "but the total flux decreased further , and the profile showed the red peak somewhat stronger than the blue peak .    in summary",
    ", this series of observations obtained between 2010 march and 2011 march reveal : ( 1 ) a marked increase of the broad - line flux between 2010 august and 2010 december ; ( 2 ) a significant decrease of the flux on timescales longer than a week ; ( 3 ) no significant changes in the profile on time intervals shorter than a week ; ( 4 ) an inversion in the relative strength of the blue and red peaks on a timescale of 5 months .",
    "we have quantified the observed variations by measuring the wavelengths of the blue and red peaks of the profiles , their peak flux densities , and the integrated flux of the broad line , as described below .",
    "we list the results in table [ medidas ] .    in order to isolate the broad double - peaked h@xmath2 emission and perform the measurements",
    ", we first evaluated the contribution of the narrow lines h@xmath14 , [ nii]@xmath15 , [ sii]@xmath16 and [ oi]@xmath17 by fitting gaussians to these lines and then subtracting them .",
    "the flux of the double - peaked line ( @xmath18 ) was measured by integrating the total flux under the profile after this subtraction .",
    "the average uncertainty in @xmath18 is @xmath19 erg @xmath20 s@xmath1 .",
    "the wavelengths of the blue and red peaks ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and the corresponding peak flux densities ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) were obtained by fitting three gaussians to the double - peaked profile , one for the blue peak , another for the red peak and a third gaussian for the center of the profile .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the peak flux densities of the gaussians fitted to the blue and red peaks , respectively , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding wavelengths .",
    "we have tried other methods as well , such as using splines to fit the peaks , but concluded that the fit of gaussians gave equivalent but more robust results .",
    "the average uncertainties in the measurements are @xmath25for @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath26 erg @xmath20 s@xmath1@xmath1 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    from @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "we obtained the blue and red peak velocities @xmath27 and @xmath28 relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy , adopted as the one corresponding to the narrow component of the h@xmath2 emission , as we have done in our previous studies ( sb03 ) .",
    "figure [ vels ] shows the temporal evolution of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the velocities of the blue peak range between @xmath29 and @xmath30 km s@xmath1 while for the red peak they are between 4000 and 6000kms@xmath1 .",
    "a comparison between these peak velocities with those from the period 19912001 ( sb03 ) shows that , in the new observations , the blue and red peaks always have larger peak velocities than the minimum values observed between 1991 and 2001 , which are @xmath31kms@xmath1 for the blue and @xmath32kms@xmath1 for the red , as indicated by the lower gray horizontal bars in both panels of figure[vels ] .",
    "most velocities are instead similar or higher than the maximum values observed between 1991 and 2001 , @xmath33kms@xmath1 for the blue and @xmath34kms@xmath1 for the red peak .",
    "these are indicated by the upper gray horizontal bars in figure[vels ] .",
    "the values of v@xmath35 and v@xmath36 were obtained by using the expression for the relativistic doppler effect .",
    "figure [ flarga ] shows the variation of the integrated broad h@xmath2 emission line flux from 2010 march to 2011 march .",
    "the integrated flux is always above the minimum value observed in the period 19912003 ( lower gray bar in the figure ) , being close to the maximum value from 2010 march to 2011 january ( upper gray bar in the figure ) .",
    "a maximum in the flux occurred between 2010 august 15 and 2010 december 22 , when the integrated flux rose above the maximum value observed between 1991 and 2001 .",
    "after 2010 december 23 , there was an abrupt decrease in the broad - line flux , by @xmath325% of its maximum value in 20 days .",
    "on the other hand , it can be observed that there is little variation on timescales shorter than a week ( the maximum time interval between the observations obtained in the same month ) .",
    "thus significant variations in the broad - line flux occur on a timescale just above a week . from figure [ flarga ]",
    ", one can derive a decrease of @xmath312% of the flux in 10 days .",
    "figure [ fbfr ] shows the temporal evolution of the peak fluxes of the blue and red peaks as well as that of their ratio @xmath23/@xmath24 . on 2010 march ,",
    "the red peak was stronger than the blue , while in 2010 august the blue peak was stronger .",
    "thus , within a time interval of 5 months , there has been an inversion of the @xmath23/@xmath24 ratio , and , in the following 7 months this ratio decreased to a value which is just below 1 , while in 2010 march this value was 0.7 .",
    "thus the change from a stronger red peak to a stronger blue peak was faster than the change back to a stronger red peak . from figure[fbfr ] we thus derive a timescale for the inversion of the relative intensity of the two peaks of @xmath35 months .",
    "figure [ correlacao ] shows that there is an inverse correlation between the velocity separation of the red and blue peaks @xmath28  @xmath27 and @xmath18 , observed both in our recent observations , represented by the circles , as well as in the previous observations of sb03 , represented by the crosses . this inverse correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath37 @xmath27 can be interpreted as due to : ( 1 ) when the central ionizing source becomes brighter , the line emission from the outer radii become relatively more important , as the radiation of the ionizing source reaches larger distances in the disk , where the velocity is lower ; ( 2 ) when the central source is fainter , the inner radii are favored , as the ionizing radiation reaches smaller radii , where the velocity is larger .",
    "a comparison of the two data sets in figure[correlacao ] shows that our recent data define a sequence parallel to that of the previous data , displaced from the previous data due to larger velocity separations between the two peaks and to higher fluxes .",
    "the larger velocity separation of the two peaks suggests that the line emitting portion of the disk is closer to the ionizing source or has a larger contribution from gas closer to the source .",

    "@xmath113 10@xmath114 years : this large value for the viscous timescale does not support that the observed changes in the profile  on timescales from weeks to years  are due to inward transfer of mass due to viscous torques ; 2 .   @xmath115 265 years : this is also much larger than the observed variations timescales ; 3 .",
    "@xmath116 months : the dynamical timescale depends on the radius , with the inner parts of the disk having shorter timescales than the outer parts .",
    "adopting @xmath117 for the inner radius , as obtained from our modeling , the corresponding dynamical timescale is just above 2 months .",
    "the new observations presented here show that the variation timescale of the relative strengths of the blue and red peaks ( @xmath23/@xmath24 ) is @xmath35 months ( see figure [ fbfr ] ) , thus compatible with the dynamical time . in our modeling",
    ", this variation was reproduced by the rotation of the spiral pattern around the disk , whose period is close to the dynamical time at @xmath118 ; 4 .",
    "@xmath119 days : considering the range of radii of the disk , this timescale ranges from @xmath34 to @xmath312 days .",
    "this is the shortest timescale of the disk . according to our data ( see figure [ flarga ] ) ,",
    "the smallest timescale of the profile variations  namely variations in the integrated flux of the double - peaked line  occur in @xmath1207 days .",
    "this supports the interpretation that the variability in the integrated flux @xmath18 occurs in the light travel timescale , as a result of variations in the ionizing flux .",
    "similarly , the variations in @xmath27 and @xmath28see figure [ vels]which correlate with @xmath18 , also occur in the light travel timescale . according to the models , these are due to changes in the region of maximum emissivity of the disk .",
    "the timescales discussed above provide constraints on the mechanisms that cause the changes in the double - peaked profile .",
    "our data clearly reveal two distinct timescales : ( 1 ) the first corresponding to changes in the integrated flux of the double - peaked profile , which is just over 7 days ; and ( 2 ) the second corresponding to the changes in relative strengths of the blue and red peaks , which is in the range 56 months .",
    "we have identified the first timescale with the _ light travel timescale_. in order to model the corresponding variations in the flux of the double - peaked line , and at the same time reproduce the variation of the width of the profiles it was necessary to vary the disk emissivity . when the flux is higher , the profile is narrower , and the emissivity is higher in the outer parts of the disk , while when the flux is lower , the profile is broader and the emissivity is relatively higher in the inner parts of the disk . in the saturated spiral model ,",
    "what varies is the radius of maximum emissivity .",
    "the physical scenario we favor is the following : the double - peaked profile originates in gas rotating in a thin accretion disk , which is ionized by an riaf @xcite located inside the inner radius of the line - emitting portion of the disk . as the variations occur on the _ light travel timescale _ , our interpretation is that the variation in @xmath18 can be considered a `` reverberation '' effect produced by variations in the ionizing flux from the central riaf , and allows a test for the values of the radii obtained via the models . calculating the values for the inner and outer radii of the disk in light days we obtain for @xmath121@xmath33 light days and for @xmath118@xmath311 light days , which is consistent with the variability timescale of @xmath37 days that we observe .    in order to further confirm the reverberation hypothesis",
    ", it would be necessary to do a proper `` reverberation mapping campaign '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the accretion disk via simultaneous observations of the riaf emission ( e.g. , in x - rays ) and the double - peaked profile .",
    "we plan to pursue such a monitoring campaign in the future , including a more extended spectral coverage to include the blue part of the optical spectrum which will also allow us to test other models for the origin of the continuum , such as the one proposed by @xcite .",
    "we have identified the second timescale  of the variations in the relative strengths of the blue and red peaks  with the _",
    "dynamical timescale_. this means that the asymmetry in the profile is due to a non - axisymmetric emitting structure  modeled as a single spiral arm  rotating in the disk , with a rotation period of @xmath318 months .",
    "this timescale and its interpretation differs from our previous one ( sb03 ) . in that paper",
    "we concluded that the variation of the relative strengths of the two peaks occurred in the _ sound - crossing timescale_. this distinct interpretation was due to the fact that the period we have derived then for the variation was 5.5yr , and at that time our estimate for the smbh mass was @xmath310@xmath122 @xmath123 , giving a smaller value for the sound - crossing timescale , consistent with the derived period of variation . with a revised smbh mass two orders of magnitude larger ,",
    "the revised sound - crossing timescale is much larger than the timescale of the variation of the relative fluxes of the blue and red peaks we have now derived from our more frequent observations .",
    "is important to point out that the perturbation does not need to be a spiral arm , even though we used the spiral arm prescription to model it . in the images of the disk ,",
    "constructed using the best model parameters for the different epochs , shown in figure [ modelo2 ] , the spiral arm actually looks more like an azimuthal arc .",
    "therefore , it could be that this arc is actually a clump that was produce by self - gravity and then sheared ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "another alternative is that this feature is an irradiation - induced warp @xcite .",
    "but although the irradiation - induced warp model can reproduce the observed variability of the line profiles @xcite , the required rotation timescale is incompatible with the mass of the smbh in ngc 1097 ( see equation ( 4 ) in @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the sheared clump would orbit the smbh on the dynamical timescale and therefore could reproduce the 5 month variation that we observe .",
    "figure[correlacao ] shows that the profiles got broader and brighter in the recent ( 20102011 ) observations when compared to the previous ones ( 1991 - 2001 ) , although at both epochs there is an inverse correlation between the flux and width of the profiles .",
    "this inverse correlation is expected in the reverberation scenario discussed above , but there is an offset between the previous and present correlations .",
    "a comparison between the parameters of the present and previous spiral arm model shows that the emissivity law in the recent epochs favors a higher contribution of the inner regions relative to the outer regions of the disk , leading to a broader profile .",
    "one possibility to explain this increase in emissivity of the innermost regions is an increase in the gas density in these regions of the disk in the most recent epochs when compared to the period 19912001 .",
    "a comparison between figures [ mod1 ] and [ mod3 ] shows that the saturated spiral model gives a better fit to the double - peaked profiles . in order to quantify the goodness of the fits ,",
    "we have obtained the root mean square ( rms ) deviation between the observed profiles and the models . in almost all observations the saturated spiral model provided a smaller rms when compared with that for the single spiral arm model , confirming what is seen in the fits .",
    "finally , we point out that , although the models can in general reproduce the h@xmath2 profiles , there are several epochs in which we observe an excess flux in the blue wings of the profiles relative to the models . this excess flux is observed from 2010 august to february 2011 ( figures [ mod1 ] and [ mod3 ] ) . in addition , from 2011 january to march we observe a systematic blueshift of the center of the line , from @xmath39230 to @xmath39550 km s@xmath1 which could be due to an accretion disk wind .",
    "therefore , it will be worthwhile in future work to compare the observed line profiles with models that include an outflowing wind ( e.g. , @xcite )      the physical value of the disk timescales , such as the light - travel timescale ( @xmath93 ) , as well as the inner and outer radii of the accretion disk , are strongly dependent on the mass of the smbh .",
    "thus , uncertainties in its determination must be taken into account .",
    "we have adopted here the smbh mass value of @xcite : @xmath124 @xmath104 .",
    "the range of values for the inner and outer radii of the accretion disk ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively ) resulting from the uncertainties in the smbh mass quoted by @xcite are @xmath127 light - days and @xmath128 light - days .",
    "but @xcite obtain the value for the smbh mass using the @xmath46@xmath62 relation of @xcite , pointing out that they do not take into account the scatter in this relation .",
    "they consider only the uncertainty in the coefficients of the relation that results from the scatter ( effectively they assume that the observed scatter is not intrinsic ) .",
    "if we now consider that the uncertainty in the smbh mass is also affected by the scatter in the @xmath46@xmath62 relation from @xcite , which can introduce an uncertainty in the mass of @xmath3 0.3dex , the resulting minimum and maximum values for the inner and outer radii become : ( 1 ) for @xmath129 @xmath104 , the minimum radii are @xmath130 light - days and @xmath131 light - days ; ( 2 ) for @xmath132 @xmath104 , the maximum radii are @xmath133 light - days and @xmath134 light - days .    thus , even considering the maximum uncertainties which could affect the determination of the smbh mass , the resulting values for the inner and outer radii of the disk are still of the order of light - days .",
    "the above results support the interpretation that the shortest variation timescale of 7days is the light - travel time between the ionizing source at the center of the disk and the mean radius of the disk .",
    "in fact , this observed timescale can actually constrain the values of @xmath40 to @xmath135light - days and of @xmath136 to @xmath137light - days .",
    "in addition , if we assume that 7light - days is the mean distance between the broad - line - emitting clouds and the smbh , we can estimate the mass of the smbh independently from the model , as follows . if this system of clouds is flattened , as suggested by their double - peaked profile , and we adopt as the corresponding keplerian velocity around the smbh the mean velocity of the peaks@xmath138kms@xmath1we obtain @xmath46=1.1@xmath139@xmath123 , for an inclination of 34@xmath140 relative to the plane of the sky ( as obtained from the disk model ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the one obtained by @xcite .",
    "we report the discovery of short timescale variations in the broad double - peaked h@xmath2 emission line from the liner nucleus of ngc1097 , observed in 9 epochs between 2010 march and 2011 march .",
    "they comprise : ( 1 ) variations in the integrated flux and width of the line over a timescale of @xmath1417 days , which we identified as the light - travel time between the ionizing source and the disk ; it is the first time that such short timescale variations have been seen in a double - peaked profile from the nucleus of a galaxy ; ( 2 ) variations in the relative intensity of the blue and red peaks on a timescale of 56 months , which is compatible with the disk dynamical timescale .      1 .   short timescale changes in the disk emissivity  namely in the contrast @xmath50 and index @xmath69 in the _ spiral arm model _ and @xmath50 and @xmath89 in the _ saturated spiral model _ ; 2 .   the rotation of the spiral arm  via the change of the orientation @xmath53 of the arm in both models  resulting in a estimate for the rotation period of the arm of @xmath142 months .",
    "the values of the inner and outer radii , obtained from previous modeling , were kept in the present modeling and are , respectively , @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( corresponding to @xmath145 and 11 light - days , respectively ) .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the short timescale variations seen in our observations .",
    "this agreement supports the identification of the shortest timescale variations with the light travel time between the ionizing source and the accretion disk , in one hand , and gives further support to the model and the derived parameters , on the other hand .",
