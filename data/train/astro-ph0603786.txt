    "the most commonly used method to explore the dark energy models in the literature is to assume an adhoc equation of state @xmath0@xmath5@xmath6 for dark energy and parametrize @xmath0 or dimensionless dark energy function @xmath7@xmath5@xmath8 by one , two or more free parameters and then constrain these parameters by fitting to the observed snia , cmb and lss data . using this method",

    "we have adopted a different approach in this paper to constrain @xmath0 using dynamical age of the universe as the criterion to test the physical viability of different parametrizations .",
    "first , we argue that the age of the universe known observationally from various independent methods is found to be reasonably consistent and it can be used as an effective constraint on the evolution of the dark energy equation of state @xmath0 because the dynamical age of the universe depends on the hubble expansion rate , which essentially involves @xmath10 .",

    "the best estimate of the dynamical age of the universe , coming from cmb data , is @xmath25 gyr .",
    "although this method also presumes the cosmological constant , it is shown that the variation of the equation of state away from @xmath11 at fixed @xmath26 ( the angle subtended by the acoustic horizon on the last scattering surface ) has very little effect on the age of the universe . moreover",
