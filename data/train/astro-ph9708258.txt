    "blazars are extragalactic objects with core dominated , flat spectrum , variable radio sources .",
    "radio spectra smoothly join the infrared - optical - uv spectra , and in all these bands flux is highly variable and polarized .",
    "these properties are shared by bl lac objects as well as by most flat spectrum radio - quasars ( fsrq ) , and are successfully interpreted in terms of synchrotron radiation produced in relativistic jets and beamed into our direction @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is strongly supported by direct observations of superluminal motions observed in radio cores in vlbi data @xcite , and lays the grounds for the unified scheme of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .    as was recently discovered by _",
    ", many blazars are strong and variable sources of high energy @xmath0rays @xcite ; in a few sources , the spectrum extends up to the tev energies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0ray radiation forms a separate spectral component , with the luminosity peak located in the mev - tev range .",
    "variability of gev / tev radiation itself provides evidence for relativistic speeds of radiating plasma @xcite , and the lack of high energy @xmath0rays in agns other than blazars proves that @xmath0rays must be at least as well collimated as synchrotron radiation .",
    "production of high energy radiation was predicted many years ago by synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) models @xcite . in this process ,",
    "the same electrons that produce synchrotron radiation also upscatter some of synchrotron photons to @xmath0ray energies .",
    "however , as was recently recognized , the ssc process is not necesarily the one which produces most of the @xmath0rays . the competing process , at least in quasars , may be the comptonization of external radiation .",
    "models based on this process are called erc ( external radiation compton ) and their original variants have been investigated by dermer , schlickeiser , & mastichiadis @xcite , sikora , begelman , & rees @xcite , blandford & levinson @xcite , ghisellini & madau @xcite .",
    "production of @xmath0rays is also predicted by so - called hadronic models , where ultrarelativistic electrons / positrons are injected by relativistic protons @xcite .",
    "different scenarios of @xmath0ray production in agn jets are reviewed in  2 .",
    "their predictions are confronted with multiwavelength spectral and variability data in  3 , and discussion of what we have learned already and can learn in the nearest future about agn jet physics from the blazar observations is presented in  4 .",
    "the fact that the spectra of synchrotron components blazars extend up to optical , uv , and even x  ray bands indicates that agn jets contain highly relativistic electrons / positrons , with lorentz factors up to @xmath1 .",
    "energy losses of such electrons are so rapid that they must be accelerated / injected _ in situ _ ,",
    "i.e. at the locations where they radiate .",
    "these locations are the sites of the energy dissipation events , which propagate along the jet at moderate ( @xmath2 ) relativistic speeds .",
    "the dissipation events can result from interaction of the jet with external obstacles , annihilation of magnetic fields , and/or collisions of inhomogeneities in a jet @xcite . during such events ,",
    "a part of the dissipated energy is converted to relativistic electrons and protons .",
    "models based on the assumption that the high energy @xmath0-rays are produced by directly accelerated electrons are discussed in  2.1 , while hadronic models for @xmath0radiation production are reviewed briefly in  2.2 .      assuming that the momentum distribution of relativistic electrons is isotropic in the comoving frame of dissipative events @xcite and that ssc and erc operate in the thomson regime",
    ", one can compare radiation production in these processes using formulae for electron cooling rates    @xmath3    and ( @xcite )    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the random lorentz factor of relativistic electrons , @xmath6 is the energy density of synchrotron radiation produced by the source with radius @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the energy density of the external radiation field @xcite , @xmath9 is the fraction of the central radiation isotropized by reprocessing and/or rescattering at a distance scale corresponding with a distance @xmath10 from the central source , and all primed quantities are as measured in the source comoving frame .    using formulae ( 1 ) -",
    "( 4 ) one can find that @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "the above formula can be used to find the ratio of the observed ssc and erc luminosities , provided that the angular distributions of radiation fields are known .",
    "for isotropic ( tangled ) magnetic field , the synchrotron radiation in the source frame is isotropic , and for jets with @xmath13 , the observer located at @xmath14 sees @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the doppler factor . as was pointed out by dermer @xcite , this is not the case for the erc process .",
    "compton scattered radiation , as measured in the source comoving frame , can have quasi - isotropic distribution only for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the lorentz factor at which the flux of the external radiation field is zero .    as was shown by sikora et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath19 at @xmath20 pc , @xmath9 is provided by rescattering of central radiation by hot gas present in coronae or winds around accretion disks .",
    "up to @xmath21 pc , this is dominated by the fraction of the central radiation converted to emission lines by optically thick clouds / filaments , and at larger distances , it is determined by the fraction of the central radiation reemitted by dust . for a typical quasar environment , @xmath9 is expected to be @xmath22 , and , for such values , equation ( 6 ) gives @xmath23 .",
    "this is much less than the lorentz factors of agn jets which are typically enclosed in the range @xmath24 and often reach values @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the external radiation is seen by the emitting cloud of plasma moving at @xmath26 as coming from the front .",
    "in such a field , the compton scattered radiation is produced with a highly anisotropic distribution , with a large deficiency of radiation scattered into the @xmath27-hemisphere .",
    "as measured in the external frame , such radiation is beamed more strongly than the synchrotron radiation and the observed luminosity @xmath28 . however , for comparable total emitted luminosities , the respective observed luminosities @xmath29 and @xmath30 , if averaged over the @xmath31-cone , are also comparable .",
    "then , for the case @xmath32 , for which the angular distribution of radiation within the @xmath31-cone is smeared out , the formula @xmath33 can be used for all @xmath34-observers . since in quasars @xmath2 and @xmath35 erg s@xmath36 , while @xmath37 observed in fsrq is in the range @xmath38 erg s@xmath36 , the above formula seems to prove strong domination of the erc process over the ssc process in quasar jets .",
    "however , it should be noted here that because of the different energy distributions of the ambient radiation fields , the respective high energy components produced by a given population of electrons will not overlap entirely . as a result ,",
    "a less luminous ssc component produced by far infrared radiation can still be visible in soft / mid x ",
    "rays @xcite , while relativistic electrons injected at a distance @xmath39pc can produce in the mev range two separate `` bumps '' , one due to comptonization of external uv radiation and one due to comptonization of external near - ir radiation .",
    "the situation is less clear in bl lac objects , where the radiative environment in the central region is not very well known .",
    "the lack of strong emission lines and of uv excesses ( even during lowest states ) suggest that in these objects @xmath40 can be very low .",
    "noting also that in bl lac objects @xmath41 factors are typically smaller than in quasars @xcite , domination of ssc over erc in these objects is very likely .",
    "one should be warned , however , that for bl lac objects with the high energy spectra extending up to tev energies the formula ( 7 ) can not be applied directly ; this is because the klein - nishina effect reduces the efficiency of the compton process , and this reduction is different for different energy distributions of the ambient radiation fields .      in all particle acceleration processes",
    ", the injection of relativistic electrons / positrons is accompanied by injection of relativistic protons .",
    "their energy can be converted to high energy radiation following such processes as direct synchrotron radiation of protons , proton - photon pair production , photomeson production , and nuclear collisions .",
    "the first three processes are known to be very inefficient , and in agn jets can become important only for proton energies @xmath42 gev . only for such high energies can",
    "the time scales of the proton energy losses become comparable to or shorter than the propagation time scale of the source in a jet .",
    "energy losses of such energetic protons are dominated by photomeson production , and this process was used by mannheim and bierman @xcite to model @xmath0ray production in luminous blazars .    the radiation target for photomeson production",
    "is dominated by the near / mid - infrared radiation . in quasars ,",
    "such radiation is provided by hot dust at distances @xmath43 parsecs from the central source and by synchrotron radiation in a jet , produced by directly accelerated electrons .",
    "the main output of the photomeson process are single pions .",
    "they take about 30% of the protons energy and convert it to photons , neutrinos , and through muons , to electrons and positrons .",
    "the photons injected by neutral pions are immediately absorbed by soft photons in the pair production process .",
    "these pairs and electrons / positrons injected by muons have lorentz factors @xmath44 . for such energies ,",
    "compton scattering with the ambient radiation field takes place deeply in the klein - nishina regime and , therefore , their energy losses are dominated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "most of this radiation is so energetic that it produces two more generations of photons and pairs .",
    "the final output of this synchrotron - supported pair cascade is the high energy component , enclosed within or cut off at energies above which photons are absorbed by @xmath45-pair production process .",
    "this maximum energy can be @xmath46 gev in fsrq , as determined by external uv radiation , and @xmath39 tev in low luminosity bl lac objects , as determined by infrared radiation of dust @xcite .",
    "the weakness of the `` photomeson '' model is that it requires fine tuning in order to avoid situations where the luminosity peak lies below mev energies .",
    "this is because , after 3 pair generations , the location of the peak depends on the 6th power of the maximum proton energy .",
    "also , even if a model is successful in locating the peak of the high energy component , there is still the problem of how to obtain the hard x  ray spectra after three generations of the pair cascade process @xcite . to overcome this difficulty , mannheim @xcite proposed that transition from softer @xmath0ray spectra to harder x  ray spectra results from a break in the pair injection function .",
    "this , however , requires the ambient radiation to be transparent to @xmath0rays up to energies @xmath47 tev , while external uv and near - ir radiation fields are expected to cut the spectrum in quasars at @xmath46 gev for @xmath48 pc and at @xmath39 tev for larger distances .",
    "the photomeson scenario was also suggested to explain the production of tev radiation in low luminosity bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of variability on time scales @xmath49 hour seems to jeopardize this idea .",
    "this is because to get proton energy losses on such short time scales , much higher ir luminosities are required than are observed .",
    "much less extreme proton energies are required in models based on the assumption that proton energy losses are dominated by collisions with the ambient gas .",
    "the final output of these collisions is the same as in the photomeson process , i.e. , relativistic electrons / positrons , photons and neutrinos .",
    "the process can be efficient only if the column density of the target is @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "bednarek @xcite proposed as a target the funnels formed around the black hole by a geometrically thick disk , while dar and laor @xcite suggested interactions of jet with clouds and/or stellar winds .",
    "the shortcoming of such models is that relativistic protons , before colliding with the nuclei , may easily suffer deflections by magnetic fields ; this generally results in a lack of collimation of the radiation produced following pp collisions .",
    "if both high - energy and low - energy spectral components are produced by the same population of relativistic electrons , and the production of high energy radiation is dominated by the ssc process , then @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the energy density of magnetic field .",
    "equations  ( 3 ) and ( 8) give @xmath54 which , in the case of steady flow with @xmath55 , determines the flux of magnetic energy @xmath56 for @xmath2 , @xmath57 this gives @xmath58 , which is about 3 orders of magnitude less than the typical power of the quasar jets @xcite .",
    "thus , the observed high @xmath0ray luminosities can be explained in terms of the ssc models only if one assumes that the jets are very weakly magnetized . in the case of erc models we have @xmath59 and",
    "provided that @xmath30 and @xmath37 are luminosities observed at @xmath34 and that @xmath32 , we can use the scaling @xmath60 . with this scaling equations ( 4 ) and ( 11 ) give @xmath61 this gives @xmath62 which is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude greater than in the case of the ssc model .",
    "another interesting aspect of comparing erc and ssc radiation components with the synchrotron component is the angular distribution of these radiation fields . as was shown by dermer @xcite and",
    "discussed in  2.1 , erc radiation is much more strongly collimated than the synchrotron and ssc radiation .",
    "since ssc and synchrotron radiation fields have the same angular distribution ( they both are produced isotropically in the source comoving frame ) , the predicted high - energy to low - energy luminosity ratio does nt depend on @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , the erc model predicts this ratio to drop very rapidly with viewing angle outside the @xmath31-cone .",
    "dermer proposed that this can explain why a significant fraction of fsrq do not show @xmath0ray activity , even though they are otherwise recognized as typical blazars on the basis of the low energy component properties .",
    "x  rays in different sub - classes of blazars can have different origins .",
    "in most bl lac objects x  ray spectra are steep ( @xmath63 ) and variable , and lie on an extrapolation of the uv spectrum .",
    "this indicates that x ",
    "rays in these objects represent high energy tails of the synchrotron component . in fsrqs , the x",
    " ray spectra are usually very hard ( @xmath64 ) , showing weaker variability than in other spectral bands .",
    "these spectra are often interpreted as low energy tails of the @xmath0ray components ; however , one can not exclude the possibility that they are superposed from two or more components . and finally , there are intermediate objects where the soft x ",
    "rays are dominated ( at least occasionally ) by the synchrotron component , while higher energy x",
    " rays belong to the high - energy compton component @xcite .",
    "these differences in the x  ray spectra seem to follow the general trend where in less luminous blazar , the peaks of the low - energy ( synchrotron ) component are located at higher energies @xcite .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the hard x  ray spectra of fsrqs is that , together with the @xmath0rays , they form a single component produced by the erc process . in the model , the spectral slope changes from a steeper one in the @xmath0ray band to a harder one in the x  ray band , as a result of incomplete cooling of electrons below certain energy which is determined by an equality of the erc cooling time scale and the propagation time scale @xcite .",
    "the break is located in the @xmath65 mev range if the distance of radiation production is @xmath66 pc .    in erc models ,",
    "the x  ray spectra imprint the distribution of lorentz factors of relativistic electrons down to @xmath67 for the x ",
    "rays produced by comptonization of ir radiation , and even down to @xmath68 for the x ",
    "rays produced by comptonization of uv radiation . since for distances @xmath69 pc the low energy electrons cool very inefficiently , to produce the observed x  ray flux by erc process requires such a large number of electrons that the jet must be strongly pair dominated in order to avoid unreasonable high kinetic energy flux .",
    "another possibility is that hard x  ray spectra are superposed from partial spectra produced over a wide range of distances and having low - energy cutoffs at energies which increase with distance @xcite . in this model , the soft x ",
    "rays are produced closely to the black hole , and therefore the production of x  rays can be accomplished by a lower number of electrons , and thus the jet plasma need not be pair - dominated .",
    "finally , the hard x  ray spectra can be produced by ssc radiation , while production of high energy @xmath0rays can be dominated by erc process @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a wide range of @xmath70 is acceptable .",
    "very interesting constraints on the agn jets come not only from what we _ do _ observe , but also from what we _ do not _ observe .",
    "a feature that was predicted  but not confirmed observationally  is radiation produced by cold electrons in a jet .",
    "such electrons , dragged by the protons and/or magnetic fields in the jet , for @xmath26 , should scatter external uv photons and produce a collimated beam of bulk - compton radiation @xcite .",
    "the predicted observed luminosity is @xmath71 where @xmath72 @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the distance at which this process is most efficient . the bulk - compton spectrum should have a peak at @xmath75 .",
    "since this is not observed , @xmath76 must be smaller than the luminosity @xmath77 of the nonthermal x  ray spectrum in the soft x  ray band .",
    "this gives an upper limit for the thompson optical thickness in a jet @xmath78 i.e. , @xmath79 for @xmath2 , @xmath80 erg s@xmath36 , and @xmath81 erg s@xmath36 , with this limit , the processes scaled by @xmath82 ( like annihilation , bremsstrahlung and coulomb interactions ) are inefficient , and play a negligible role in shaping the spectra of blazars .",
    "this is because in such thin plasmas , the time scales of these processes are much longer than the time scale of plasma propagation in a jet @xcite .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath83 also gives interesting constraints on the @xmath84 pair content of a jet .",
    "if @xmath85 is the radius where @xmath83 is maximal and if for @xmath86 the pair flux is conserved , then for a conical jet @xmath87 and , therefore , the bulk - compton radiation is mostly contributed by the innermost parts of the jet . assuming that the kinetic energy flux in a jet is dominated by cold protons",
    ", we have @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number density of protons in the jet comoving frame . noting that @xmath90 ,",
    "we have @xmath91 substituting this into the formula for @xmath76 evaluated for @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "then , the condition @xmath95 gives that for powerful ( @xmath96 ) and pair - dominated ( @xmath97 ) jets , overproduction of soft x ",
    "rays can be avoided only at very large distances ( @xmath98 ) from the black hole .",
    "discovery of strong and variable @xmath0ray radiation in blazars by cgro provided an exceptional possibilities to explore and verify the operation of various nonthermal processes in agn jets , and to study the structure , energetics and matter content of these jets .",
    "the main achievements of such studies and future prospects are listed below :    @xmath99 @xmath0ray radiation provides independent evidence that blazar radiation is produced by relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "this is because the compactness of the source derived from the observed @xmath0- and x  ray luminosities and variability time scales is so high that if it was intrinsic ( true ) compactness , all @xmath0rays would be absorbed by @xmath45 pair production process .",
    "this implies that the true source compactness must be much lower than the observed one , and this is the case if the observed radiation originates from plasma propagating in our direction at relativistic speed .",
    "@xmath99 @xmath0rays can be also absorbed by external radiation fields , and because the compactness of such fields decreases with distance , this gives the minimum distance from which the @xmath0rays can escape .",
    "of course , since the opacity for @xmath45 interactions depends on energy and is higher for more energetic @xmath0rays , the minimum escape distance is smaller for less energetic @xmath0rays .",
    "such stratified @xmath0ray production was suggested by blandford and levinson @xcite in their inhomogeneous version of erc model .",
    "@xmath99 huge apparent @xmath0ray luminosities , reaching in some fsrq @xmath100 erg s@xmath36 , provide independent evidence that agn jets must be very powerful , with @xmath101 , i.e. , @xmath102 erg s@xmath36 for radiation efficiency @xmath103 , @xmath2 and time - averaged observed luminosity @xmath104 erg s@xmath36 .",
    "@xmath99 comparison of the erc efficiency with the ssc efficiency for typical quasar radiation fields implies that the production of @xmath0rays in fsrq should be strongly dominated by comptonization of external radiation .",
    "however , ssc can still contribute visibly to the x  ray band @xcite .",
    "@xmath99 comparing erc and ssc spectra with the synchrotron spectra ,",
    "one can attempt to derive physical parameters of radiating plasma - such as maximum electron energies , magnetic fields , electron injection function , and distance of the source from the black hole @xcite . however , such analyses must be performed by taking into account that the observed spectra , especially their lower energy parts ( in both the synchrotron and the compton components ) may well be superposed by two or more components .",
    "@xmath99 in the case of fsrq , simultaneous observations in the @xmath0ray and x ",
    "rays bands must be used to verify various mechanisms of x  ray production .",
    "this can help to establish the pair content in agn jets .",
    "in particular , the correlation and absence of a time lag between the @xmath0ray and the x  ray flares ( as seen in jan , 1996 in 3c279 ;",
    "@xcite ) may indicate co - spatial production of both , and in the case of x ",
    "rays produced by the erc process , this would indicate a pair - dominated plasma .",
    "ray limits for the bulk - compton process prove that agn jets are optically thin .",
    "this implies that such processes as bremsstrahlung , annihilation and coulomb interactions are inefficient in these jets .",
    "@xmath99 for a given @xmath70 , the upper limit for the bulk - compton radiation gives a minimum distance for jet formation .",
    "for strongly pair - dominated plasmas this distance is @xmath105 pc .",
    "however , jets with energy flux @xmath106 erg s@xmath36 must be powered very near the black hole , by its rotation @xcite or by the innermost parts of an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "these two inferences  the large distances of formation of pair - dominated jets and the very central source of the jet energy  can be reconciled if over the first 3 decades of distance , the jet is strongly dominated by the poynting flux .",
    "this very wide distance range of conversion of the magnetic energy to the bulk kinetic energy can result from radiation drag @xcite .",
    "this transition process can be accompanied by pair production in shocks and magnetic field reconnection sites @xcite .",
