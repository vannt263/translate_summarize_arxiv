    "according to the heisenberg uncertainty principle , it is possible to detect the position of a particle with arbitrary accuracy , if there is no restriction on its momentum .",
    "thus , the fuzziness of the position measurement within a minimum length scale , is not consistent with the usual heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "however , almost all approaches to quantum gravity predict the existence of a minimum measurable length scale . this is because , in most of these approaches the continuum picture of space - time breaks down near the planck scale , which in turn implies that the planck length acts like a minimum measurable length scale for all these approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "indeed , there are strong indications from the physics of black holes , that a minimum length of the order of the planck length should act as an universal feature of all models of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this is the energy needed to probe spacetime below planck length scale will give rise to a mini black hole in that region of spacetime .",
    "also , in the context of perturbative string theory , the strings are the smallest probe available , and so , it is not possible to probe the spacetime below the string length scale .",
    "thus , the string length scale acts as a minimum measurable length in string theory @xcite . even in loop quantum gravity",
    ", it is expected that a minimum length scale may exist , and this can have important phenomenological consequence .",
    "in fact , in loop quantum gravity , the existence of the minimum length scale turns big bang into a big bounce @xcite .    in order to incorporate the existence of a minimum measurable length scale with the uncertainty relation ,",
    "the usual heisenberg uncertainty relation has been generalized to a new uncertainty principle , so called , the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite .",
    "as the usual uncertainty relation is closely related to the canonical heisenberg algebra , so , this deformed uncertainty principle modifies the canonical heisenberg algebra to a non - canonical one , so that , the commutator of the position and momentum operators becomes momentum dependent , instead of a constant . with this non - canonical algebra ,",
    "the coordinate representation of the momentum operator get modified , and this in turn produces correction terms for all quantum mechanical systems . on the other hand , there is a another kind of deformation of the heisenberg algebra , that has been proposed in the context of doubly special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite and has the motivation of studying both the velocity of light and planck energy as universal constants .",
    "it may be noted that , the deformed heisenberg algebra studied in dsr theory has been predicted from many consequences , such as , discrete spacetime @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking of lorentz invariance in string field theory @xcite , spacetime foam models @xcite , spin - network in loop quantum gravity @xcite , non - commutative geometry @xcite , and horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "it is possible to generalize the dsr in curved space - time and the resultant theory is called the gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the above two deformation s of the heisenberg algebra can be combined into a single deformation of the heisenberg algebra @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the commutator of the position and momentum operators in this algebra contains a linear power of momentum , and therefore , called as the linear gup model .",
    "the momentum operators for this model , contain non - local fractional derivative terms in all the quantum mechanical hamiltonian .",
    "however , such non - local terms do not occur for one dimensional systems .",
    "this advantage has motivated the study of the deformation of various one dimensional quantum mechanical systems by the linear gup .",
    "the effect of this deformation on the transition rate of ultra cold neutrons in gravitational field has been studied in @xcite .",
    "this deformation has been studied in cosmology , turns the big bang into a big bounce @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lamb shift and landau levels have also been analyzed using this deformed heisenberg algebra @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting result has been obtained from this algebra , is that , the space actually has to be a discrete structure @xcite . in demonstrating the existence of a discrete structure for the space , therein the schrdinger wave equation for a free particle was deformed by linear gup .",
    "similar results have been obtained by repeating this analysis using the relativistic wave equation by the linear gup @xcite .",
    "thermodynamical properties of simple quantum mechanical systems have also been analyzed using this deformed hesinberg algebra @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the corrections to the thermodynamic properties of system caused by this deformed hesinberg algebra are similar to the corrections produced from the polymeric quantization . in a series of papers , various applications of the new model of the linear gup",
    "have been investigated @xcite .",
    "a review of the phenomenology consequences of gup can be found in @xcite .    even though a lot of work has been done with both the quadratic gup and the linear gup and almost all these results",
    "have been derived using canonical quantization",
    ". however , the link to classical mechanics in path integral formalism is very intuitive .",
    "this is because , in path integral formalism the quantum theory is constructed by adding quantum corrections to the classical results .",
    "the path integral formalism can also be used for analyzing non - perturbative phenomena like instantons in quantum mechanics .",
    "the generalization of such non - perturbative phenomena to field theory has led to the discovery of some very important results in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sometimes in the certain systems like superconductors @xcite and super - fluids @xcite , the degrees of freedom of these systems lock to form a single collective variables .",
    "path integral is ideally suited to deal with such situations @xcite .",
    "so , it is desirable to analyze the deformed heisenberg algebra using the path integral formalism .",
    "in fact , recently deformed heisenberg algebra corresponding to quadratic gup has been analyzed by using the path integral formalism @xcite .",
    "now , as there are theoretical reasons for the existence of the linear gup , it is important to extend this work for the deformation heisenberg algebra which is consistent linear gup .",
    "this is what we are aimed to do in this paper .",
    "first , we will derive the modified propagator of path integral with the linear gup model , and compare our results with the quadratic gup and the dsr models . with these comparison in hand",
    ", we will show that different deformations give rise to different behavior for this system .",
    "in particular , by comparing the graphical plots of probability amplitude of the propagator corresponding to the different algebras , we will explore that they provide different results for different deformation .",
    "the probability amplitude decreases for quadratic gup case , whereas it increases for the linear gup .    in section 2",
    ", we will use the harmonic extension of functions to give a formal meaning to the fractional derivative terms that occurs because of the linear gup . in section 3",
    ", we will explicitly derive the expression for a one dimensional free particle propagator using the path integral formalism . in section 3",
    ", we will analyze the properties of this deformed propagator .",
    "finally , we will summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we analyze the non - local heisenberg algebra using harmonic extension of functions .",
    "first , we start with the deformed heisenberg algebra corresponding to the gup that can be written as @xcite @xmath3 = i \\hbar[\\delta^i_{j}(1 + \\beta \\tilde p^2)+ 2 \\beta \\tilde p^i \\tilde p_j],\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a parameter of deformation . on the other hand ,",

    "the upper bounds on the parameter @xmath13 has been calculated in @xcite , and it was proposed that this gup may introduce an intermediate length scale between planck scale and electroweak scale .",
    "recent proposals suggest that this bound can be measured by using quantum optics techniques @xcite , and also by gravitational wave techniques @xcite , which are to be considered as a milestone in quantum gravity phenomenology .",
    "it may be noted that in one dimension , the deformed uncertainty relation corresponding to this algebra , can be written as @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "this in turn implies the existence of a minimum length @xmath15 and a maximum momentum @xmath16 .",
    "now , the deformed commutation relation ( [ x - p - com ] ) modifies the momentum operator as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , and the canonical pair @xmath19 satisfies the canonical algebra @xmath20 = i \\hbar \\delta^j_i$ ] . here",
    "@xmath21 can be interpreted as the momentum at low energy .",

    "<S> it has been observed that , though this algebra can give rise to fractional derivative terms in the corresponding quantum mechanical hamiltonian , a formal meaning can be given to them by using the theory of harmonic extensions of function . depending on this argument , the expression of the propagator of the path integral corresponding to the deformed heisenberg algebra , has been obtained . in particular , the consistent expression of the one dimensional free particle propagator has been evaluated explicitly . with this propagator in hand , it has been shown that , even in free particle case , normal generalized uncertainty principle and doubly special relativity shows very much different result .    </S>",
