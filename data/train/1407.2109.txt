    "property testing is motivated by the need to understand how to extract information efficiently from massive structured or semi - structured data sets using small random samples .",
    "one of the main and most successful directions in property testing is _ testing graph properties _ , as introduced in papers of goldreich et al .",
    "there are two popular models for this task , which make different assumptions about how the input graph is represented and how it can be accessed .    for a long time",

    "known examples include all hyperfinite properties @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for previous general results ) , connectivity , @xmath11-edge - connectivity , the property of being eulerian @xcite , and the property of having a perfect matching @xcite . on the other hand , some properties testable in constant time in the dense graph model , such as bipartiteness and 3-colorability ,",

    "<S> informally , our approach is to self - reduce the problem of finding an odd - length cycle in a multigraph @xmath0 induced by a collection of cycles to the same problem in another multigraph @xmath5 induced by a set of shorter odd - length cycles , in such a way that when a random walk finds a cycle in @xmath5 with probability @xmath6 , then it does so in @xmath0 with probability @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction is applied until the cycles collapse to self - loops , in which case they can be easily detected .    </S>",
    "<S> while the analysis presented in this paper applies only to testing bipartiteness , we believe that the techniques developed will find applications to testing other properties in arbitrary planar ( or minor - free ) graphs , in a similar way as in the past the advances in testing bipartiteness led to the development of testing algorithms for more complex graph properties . </S>"
