    "according to the core nucleated accretion model , giant planets begin their growth via the same process of agglomeration of solid bodies as do terrestrial planets ; however , unlike terrestrials , the solid cores of giant planets reach masses large enough to capture substantial amounts of gas from their star s protoplanetary disk before said disk dissipates @xcite .",
    "previous models of this process have simulated either the thermal factors that limit the ability of a planet to retain gas ( @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite ) or the disk interaction physics that governs the flow of gas to a planet ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite ) .",
    "here we consider both thermal and gas flow limits to giant planet growth , and present the first models of the growth of jupiter that are constrained by detailed simulations of both of these factors .",
    "a planet of order one to several earth masses ( m@xmath5 ) at a distance of about @xmath6 from the central star is able to capture an atmosphere from the protoplanetary disk because the escape speed from its surface is large compared to the thermal velocity of gas in the disk .",
    "however , such an atmosphere is very tenuous and distended , with thermal pressure pushing gas outwards and thereby limiting further accretion of gas .",
    "the key factor governing the ability of planet to accumulate additional gas when the mass of the atmosphere is less than the mass of the core is the planet s ability to radiate the energy that is provided to it by the accretion of planetesimals and gravitationally - induced compression of gas .",
    "the escape of this energy cools the gaseous envelope , allowing it to shrink and thereby enabling more gas to enter the planet s gravitational domain .",
    "evolution occurs slowly , and hydrostatic structure is generally a very good approximation .",
    "once a planet has enough mass for its self - gravity to compress the envelope substantially , its ability to accrete additional gas is limited only by the amount of gas available .",
    "hydrodynamic limits allow quite rapid gas flow to a planet in an unperturbed disk . but",
    "a planet alters the disk by accreting material from it and by exerting gravitational torques upon it @xcite .",
    "both of these processes can lead to gap formation and isolation of the planet from the surrounding gas .",
    "our approach is to follow the physical structure and thermal evolution of the growing giant planet in the spherically symmetric ( one - dimensional ) quasi - hydrostatic approximation , and to incorporate the three - dimensional hydrodynamic interactions between the planet and the circumstellar disk via boundary conditions at the planet s outer ` surface ' .",
    "mass and energy transport within the planet are followed using the same planetary evolution code that we have employed in previous models of giant planet formation (;",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "@xcite prescribed the accretion rate of solids to be constant with time .",
    "@xcite replaced this model by assuming that the planet was an isolated embryo that underwent runaway growth within a disk of dynamically cold , non - migrating , planetesimals .",
    "the accretion rate of solids depends upon the distribution of planetesimals as well as the planet s mass and its effective radius for accretion of planetesimals .",
    "the planet s capture cross - section was computed using the physical properties of the planet determined by the planetary structure calculation .",
    "the rate at which the planet accreted solids , @xmath7 , for specified planet cross - section and disk surface density , eccentricities and inclinations of planetesimals within the planet s feeding zone , was determined using formulae that @xcite derived from 3-body numerical studies of planetesimal trajectories .",
    "this prescription has been used with slight modifications in most of our subsequent calculations , including all of those presented herein .",
    "our previous simulations have used simple _",
    "ad hoc _ prescriptions for the interactions of the planet with the gaseous disk .",
    "we placed the outer boundary of the planet near its hill sphere radius , @xmath0 , during most of its growth .",
    "the radius of the planet s hill sphere is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the ( gas + solids ) mass of the planet , @xmath11 the mass of the star , and @xmath12 is the orbital radius of the planet . more precisely , , , and @xcite took the planet s boundary to be the location where the thermal velocity of the h@xmath13 gas molecules gave them sufficient energy to move upwards to @xmath14 from the planet s center .",
    "we limited the rate at which the planet could accrete gas from the disk to a maximum of @xmath15 per year , which is approximately the bondi rate .",
    "we extended many of our runs to a pre - determined mass limit of a jupiter mass or more , and in a few cases we followed the ensuing phase of planetary contraction for @xmath16 .",
    "but because of the approximate treatment of the later phases of gas accretion , we have always emphasized as our primary results the crossover time ( when the planet s gas mass equals the mass of its condensables ) and the corresponding crossover mass .",
    "the total formation time for the planet is generally only slightly longer than the crossover time .",
    "we present herein results of new simulations using our venerable 1-d planetary formation code to follow the evolution of the planet s structure , but now incorporating 3-d hydrodynamic calculations for prescriptions of the planet s size and maximum rates of gas accretion . in some of our calculations , we gradually reduce the density of gas within the surrounding disk to provide a more realistic simulation of the final phases of the planet s growth .    in the models presented herein , we neglect orbital migration . during the phase of runaway gas accretion , the amount of radial migration that is expected before the planet reaches one jupiter - mass is on the order of 20% of its initial orbital radius @xcite .",
    "orbital decay due to resonant torques during the phase of slow gas accretion ( phase  ii ) may be more substantial",
    ". however , a number of mechanisms may conspire to reduce those migration rates .",
    "there is presently a great deal of uncertainty surrounding these issues , so rather than rely on some poorly constrained and not yet well - understood migration mechanism , our simulations simply assume that the orbit of the planet remains fixed .",
    "the differing migration scenarios may affect giant planet growth in different ways , but our assumption of no migration is extreme in the sense that the isolation mass of a core within a planetesimal disk is larger for any non - zero migration of the planet , because the radial motion of the planet brings it into regions of the disk that are undepleted of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "so migrating planets , or planetesimals migrating as a result of gas drag @xcite , are likely capable of forming somewhat larger cores for a given location and disk surface mass density of solids than are the non - migrating planets that we simulate herein",
    ". competing embryos in nearby accretion zones can act in the opposite sense from the above mentioned processes by removing solids from the planet s reach .",
    "but if the planet accretes an embryo , said embryo can bring with it solids from somewhat beyond the planet s nominal accretion zone .",
    "our 1-d accretion code is described in and references therein .",
    "details on the 3-d hydrodynamic numerical code can be found in and references therein .",
    "we present our limits on the planet s physical extent and gas accretion rate , derived from 3-d hydrodynamic simulations , in section  [ sec : envsize ] .",
    "section  [ sec : simupar ] discusses the physical parameters for our simulations .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the scenario of capture of irregular satellites within proto - jupiter distended and thermally - supported envelope @xcite is discussed within the framework of our models for the growth of jupiter in section  [ sec : satellites ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : summary ] with a discussion of our findings and their implications .",
    "three - dimensional simulations of a disk with an embedded planet are used to estimate ( _ i _ ) the region of space within which gas is bound to a planetary core ( section  [ sec : outerboundary ] ) and ( _ ii _ ) the maximum accretion rate at which the disk can feed the inner parts of a growing planet s hill sphere ( section  [ sec : accretionrates ] ) .      in order to evaluate the volume of gas that is gravitationally bound to a planet , we adopt disk models similar to those described in .",
    "the simulation region extends from @xmath17 to @xmath18 in azimuth and over a radial range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , so that the disk boundaries are well separated from the planet s orbit .",
    "the pressure scale height of the disk at the planet s orbit , @xmath21 , is taken to be @xmath22% of the distance to the star ; this corresponds to a temperature of @xmath23 for a gas of mean molecular weight @xmath24 at a distance of @xmath25 from a @xmath26 ( solar mass ) star .",
    "the dimensionless disk viscosity parameter is assumed to be @xmath27 .",
    "we consider planet masses ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , because at smaller masses the planet s envelope is very tenuous , and because at a mass exceeding @xmath30 the planet self - compresses to a size much smaller than that of its hill sphere .",
    "we use grid systems that resolve the mass density and the velocity field in the vicinity of the planet on length scales shorter than @xmath31% of the hill radius ; thus the circumplanetary subdisk is also resolved .",
    "simulations are started from an unperturbed keplerian disk , whose rotation is corrected for effects of the gas pressure gradient .",
    "models are evolved for about @xmath32@xmath33 orbital periods , at which time the flow has reached a quasi - stationary state .",
    "tracer ( massless ) particles are deployed in the quasi - stationary flow , within a distance of approximately @xmath0 from the core , and their trajectories are integrated for tens of orbital periods of the planet around the sun .",
    "several initial distributions of tracers are used , for purposes of a sensitivity study , containing from @xmath34 to @xmath35 particles .",
    "the tracers are advected by the flow field and a second - order runge - kutta algorithm is used to advance their position in time .",
    "gas velocities are interpolated to the tracers positions via a monotonized harmonic mean @xcite , which is second - order accurate and capable of dealing with large gradients and shock conditions . therefore , the procedure is second - order accurate in both space and time .",
    "we adopt a conservative approach to identify trajectories trapped inside the gravitational potential of the planet . indicating with @xmath36 the distance of the @xmath37-th particle from the center of the planet at time @xmath38 , a tracer is marked as bound if @xmath39 along its calculated trajectory , where @xmath40 .",
    "the number of bound tracers can grow as @xmath41 increases because particles can temporarily move farther away from their deployment sites ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) before approaching the planet s center and being finally accreted . however , the number of trapped trajectories is expected to eventually converge , upon increasing @xmath41 , since particles that escape to librating or circulating orbits quickly move far away from the planet",
    ". therefore , to select bound tracers , we increase the value of the parameter @xmath41 until the number of selected trajectories does not change any longer , at which point we assume that the number of trapped particles has converged .",
    "finally , we check that tracers discarded according to this procedure move out of the planet s hill sphere and thus return to the circumstellar disk .",
    "note that the approach adopted here does not characterize as bound material gas that moves along trajectories originating outside of the hill sphere and accreting onto the planet .",
    "the initial distribution of bound particles is , in general , not spherically symmetric around the core , but it is roughly symmetric relative to the disk midplane , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundtracers ] .",
    "this figure shows positions ( over about @xmath43 orbital periods of the planet around the sun ) of tracers bound to a @xmath28 ( top ) and a @xmath44 ( bottom ) core and selected according to the procedure outlined above .",
    "the center of the planet is located at the origin of the axes and distances are normalized to @xmath0 .",
    "blue dots indicate positions with @xmath45 , whereas orange dots mark positions of particles trapped beyond @xmath46 .",
    "given the necessity to describe the region containing bound particles with a single length for our 1-d planetary structure calculations , we estimate the radius of the largest sphere centered on the core and enclosed in the initial distribution of selected particles .",
    "this is done by considering the area obtained from the intersection of the volume occupied by selected particles with the disk midplane and evaluating the radius of the largest circle centered on the core and enclosed in this area . for the cases we investigate ,",
    "we obtain a radius ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "an example is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tracers_xy ] .",
    "the left panel shows the initial positions of particles deployed close to the disk midplane and within @xmath49 of a @xmath28 ( top ) and a @xmath44 ( bottom ) core : blue circles represent bound tracers whereas orange circles represent particles that eventually escape from the core s hill sphere , as can be seen from their trajectories displayed in the right panel .",
    "we use the set of simulations in , together with analogous new simulations , to evaluate the maximum accretion rate at which a disk , perturbed by an embedded planet , can deliver gas to the planet s vicinity . as before ,",
    "we first consider disks with viscosity @xmath27 and local temperature @xmath50 .",
    "the numerical resolution is comparable to that of simulations discussed in the previous section . in these calculations ,",
    "the accretion of gas proceeds almost uninhibited and is only limited by tidal effects ( e.g. , the formation of a density gap ) or lack of supply from the disk . therefore , accretion rates described in this section represent upper limits to the rate at which the disk can feed the inner parts of a planet s hill sphere .",
    "we obtain gas accretion rates , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 denotes the mass of the h / he component of the planet ) , for planets ranging in mass from about @xmath53 to @xmath54 ( jupiter masses ) .",
    "data can be well fitted with a second - order polynomial written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the unperturbed surface density of gas at the orbital radius of the planet , @xmath12 , and @xmath57 is the planet s orbital period .",
    "the coefficients are : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "gas accretion rates obtained from hydrodynamical models can be re - scaled by the initial mass density in the disk , at the planet s orbital radius , because continuity and momentum equations that are solved in the calculations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be normalized to an initial mass density ( at @xmath12 , for example ) when pressure is directly proportional to mass density .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : dotmxy ] ) can be used to derive a gas accretion rate as a function of the planet s mass , its orbital radius , and the unperturbed surface density .    although we were able to halt the accretion of the planet at jupiter s mass in a disk with @xmath61 , this required either a very narrow gas feeding zone or a very special timing of disk dissipation ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "thus , in order to find a more plausible mechanism for forming jupiter - mass planets , we modeled planetary growth within a lower viscosity protoplanetary disk .",
    "we performed simulations analogous to those described above for a planet within a disk of the same temperature but lower viscosity , @xmath62 .",
    "the results for both viscosities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot_xy ] , together with the fit given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dotmxy ] ) for @xmath27 and a piecewise parabolic fit ( not given here because it can not be written in compact form ) to accretion rates obtained from calculations with @xmath62 . in both cases ,",
    "accretion rates account for surface density perturbations which depend on planet mass and disk viscosity .",
    "note that planets in the lower viscosity disk can not accrete gas as rapidly as planets of the same mass within a disk that is ten times as viscous .",
    "this is because density perturbations are stronger in the lower viscosity case , even at small planet masses .",
    "the difference in accretion rates is most profound for planets of jupiter s mass and larger .",
    "the shift of the peak accretion rates towards smaller planet masses as kinematic viscosity decreases is in qualitative agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "so long as the gas density close to the planet s orbit remains nearly undepleted , accretion rates in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot_xy ] can be understood in terms of gas accretion within the bondi sphere , at a rate @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and accretion within the hill sphere at a rate @xmath65 for larger planet mass ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "when density perturbations can no longer be neglected ( @xmath66 ) and a gap starts to form , the accretion rate drops as the planet s mass increases .",
    "the limiting gas accretion rates discussed here are not much affected by planet s migration as long as the migration timescale is larger than the gap formation timescale .",
    "we have modified our basic 1-d planet growth code to account for the limits of planet size and the supply of gas to the planet found with 3-d hydrodynamic calculations . as in and , we define the accretion radius as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the sound speed in the disk and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants . in the limit of large @xmath0 , @xmath71 reduces to @xmath69 times the bondi accretion radius . in the limit of small @xmath0",
    ", @xmath71 reduces to @xmath72 . in previous studies ,",
    "both @xmath69 and @xmath70 had been set to @xmath73 . in most of the simulations",
    "presented herein , we set @xmath74 and @xmath75 , based on the calculations described in section  [ sec : envsize ] . when thermal factors limit the gas accretion rate , @xmath51 is obtained through the requirement that the computed radius of the planet , @xmath76 , actually matches @xmath71 .",
    "when the hydrodynamics of the disk limits @xmath51 , then the radius @xmath76 is determined by the procedure outlined in , and @xmath77 .    in past work , the gas rate was arbitrarily capped at @xmath78yr to account for the bondi accretion limit . in most of the present calculations , the hydrodynamic upper bound on the gas accretion rate is determined from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot_xy ] .",
    "in analogy with the principal simulation of , denoted 10l@xmath79  is used by to denote that the surface density of solids is @xmath80 , the dust opacity in the planet s envelope is 2% that of the interstellar medium and there is no cutoff in accretion of planetesimals by the planet . as these three properties hold for all of the simulations presented herein , we use a new set of designators , discussed below , for all of our new runs . ] , all of our planetary evolution simulations are performed at @xmath25 from a @xmath26 star within a disk that has an initial surface mass density of solids of @xmath80 , which are in the form of @xmath81 radius planetesimals for a given planetesimal size .",
    "however , growth of the core is more rapid with smaller planetesimals (;",
    "thus , our simulations probably correspond more closely to a disk of @xmath82@xmath83 radius planetesimals rather than the nominal size of @xmath81 .",
    "the sizes of the planetesimals in all of these models have been chosen in a largely _ ad hoc _ manner .",
    "a better estimate of @xmath7 requires more sophisticated calculations in which planetesimal sizes and velocities are computed in a self - consistent manner rather than merely prescribed . ] , and of gas @xmath84 .",
    "also as in run 10l@xmath79 , we assume that the opacity due to grains within the growing planet s envelope is @xmath19% that of interstellar gas . in , we performed additional runs in order to examine the effects of differing values of the opacity of the planet s atmosphere and the initial surface mass density of solids in the disk , and of terminating the accretion of solids prior to the termination of gas accretion .",
    "herein , we study the orthogonal processes of ( 1 ) varying our prescription for the physical size of the planet s envelope , ( 2 ) changing the formula for the maximum rate of gas accretion as a function of the planet s mass , and ( 3 ) reducing the gas surface density of the protoplanetary disk as a function of time throughout the accretion epoch .",
    "the sixteen new simulations ( runs ) that we report herein are divided into five groups .",
    "the input parameters for each of these runs are listed in table  [ table:1 ] .    in the three groups of runs",
    "whose labels begin with `` 1 '' , referred to collectively as `` groups 1 '' , @xmath85 and the gas surface density remains constant throughout the computation , as in .",
    "the purpose of these simulations is to determine the effects of restricting gas flow onto the planet using the formula given by 3-d accretion simulations and/or reducing the radius of the outer boundary of the planet s envelope by up to a factor of four to account approximately for unbound protoplanetary disk gas flowing through the planet s hill sphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tracers_xy ] ) .",
    "specifically , run  1 g begins with the evolution found in 10l@xmath79 , but uses the gas flow limits from the 3-d calculations ( eq .  [ eq : dotmxy ] ) in place of the constant maximum gas accretion rate @xmath86 per year that was inspired by a bondi - type estimate and used in our previous studies . run  1s uses the same formulation as 10l@xmath79  except that the planet s accretion radius , @xmath71 , ( which prior to the onset of hydrodynamic limits to @xmath51 lies at the outer boundary of the planet s envelope ) is placed at the radius where the gas has enough thermal energy to escape to @xmath46 rather than to @xmath0 .",
    "run  1sg has the same planet size as run  1s and the same limits on gas flow as in simulation 1 g .",
    "run  1xsg provides a test of the sensitivity of moving the outer boundary of the envelope significantly inwards throughout the planet s evolution . in run",
    "1xsg we ( arbitrarily ) set the outer boundary of the envelope to be @xmath87 as far from the center of the planet as in 10l@xmath79  and use the same limits on the gas flow as in runs  1 g and 1sg ( i.e. , we set @xmath88 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ra ] ) . in order to produce planets with mass equal to that of jupiter",
    ", we taper off the accretion rate by multiplying the calculated maximum rate of gas accretion by a function which begins at unity when @xmath89 and drops linearly with the planet s mass so that it vanishes when @xmath90 ; this is the same procedure as was used by .",
    "all simulations in groups 2 and 3 assume the temperature of the disk ( and thus at the upper boundary of the planet as long as the planet s envelope remains in contact with the disk ) is @xmath91 , the value used in the 3-d calculations for a gas of mean molecular weight @xmath24 .",
    "the planet radius prescription for all of these groups is the same as used for runs  1s and 1sg .    in group 2 , as in groups 1 , the surface density of the gas remains constant at @xmath92 . in group 3 , the surface density of gas within the disk drops linearly according to the formula : @xmath93 the above equation accounts for disk dispersal in the planet formation region over timescales suggested by observations @xcite and recent theoretical models of disk photoevaporation due to combined action of fuv , euv , and x - ray photons emitted by a solar - mass star @xcite .    in the `` _ _ h _ _ '' runs within groups 2 and 3 , the dimensionless disk viscosity is assumed to be @xmath27 , and therefore the limiting gas accretion rate is taken from the 3-d calculations for disks with this viscosity ( as in runs  1 g , 1sg and 1xsg ) , as given by eq .",

    "analogously , the planet s accretion is halted ( in this case abruptly ) after @xmath94 in runs  2__h _ _ and 2__l__. accretion is terminated when the planet reaches @xmath95 in runs  2__h__j , 2__l__j , 3__h__j and 3__l__j . for runs  2__h__j , 2__l__j , and 3__h__j , the same taper as used for groups 1 was applied , but using this prescription for run  3__l__j did not provide adequate mass to the planet , so we began the linear tapering when the planet mass was @xmath96 rather than @xmath97 .",
    "we account for depletion of the gas in the disk via accretion onto the planet as well as the linear decline from the overall dissipation of the protoplanetary disk in runs  3__h__4r@xmath98 , 3__h__r@xmath98j , 3__l__4r@xmath98 and 3__l__r@xmath98j",

    "crossover time is @xmath109 years later in run  1xsg than it is in 10l@xmath79/1 g , because the size of the planet is significantly smaller throughout accretion ( table  [ table:2 ] ) .",

    "these results are listed in tables  [ table:3 ] and [ table:4 ] , and the masses and radii of the planet at late times are plotted in fig .",

    "the gas accretion rate of a planet with @xmath112 that is well supplied by the disk increases so rapidly that , within each of the four groups that bifurcated , the time at which disk - limited accretion set in varied by @xmath113 years even though the value of @xmath51 at this milestone differed by more than an order of magnitude in some cases .    in our previous studies , the gas density in the disk remained constant and the ability of a planet to accrete gas was a non - decreasing function of the planet s mass , so we needed to terminate accretion in a highly artificial manner . while accretion in many of the runs presented herein was terminated when the planet reached jupiter s mass , in some runs we allowed the planet to accrete until the gas density in its vicinity dropped to zero after @xmath114 had elapsed .",
    "runs  2__h _ _ and 2__l _ _ were stopped abruptly at @xmath94 , yielding planets of mass @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , respectively . in runs  3__h",
    "_ _ and 3__l _ _ , we assumed that removal of gas by the planet s accretion does not affect the gas surface density of the solar nebula in which the planet is embedded . as a result , planets of mass @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) form by the time that the prescribed gas surface density of the nebula dropped to zero at @xmath94 .    in half of the runs in group 3 ( those whose designation includes `` r '' ) , the surface density of gas in the planet s accretion zone drops as gas is accreted by the planet . during most of the formation epoch ,",
    "the planet s accretion rate of gas is smaller than the removal of gas from its feeding zone by the overall depletion of our protoplanetary disk .",
    "thus , planetary removal of gas in runs  3__h__4r@xmath98 and 3__h__r@xmath98j does not affect the planet s growth in our algorithm during this interval .",
    "indeed , for the first @xmath123 , one numerical calculation suffices to follow all eight runs in group 3 .",
    "however , when the planet begins to rapidly accrete gas , the surface density of gas within the planet s feeding zone drops rapidly , despite the addition of gas via the expansion of the feeding zone .",
    "this leads to a decline in @xmath51 .",
    "eventually , the accretion of gas by the planet becomes so small that the rate of decrease in gas surface density in the planet s accretion zone is less than the prescribed overall linear decline rate . at this point , we switch back to the linear drop - off ( i.e. , @xmath51 within the feeding zone being given by the derivative of eq .",

    "peak luminosity values ( see also tables  [ table:3 ] and [ table:4 ] ) are very similar for all of these runs apart from 3__h__j , which has a smaller peak because the surface density of gas of the disk is much lower during the late stages of planetary accretion .",
    "figure  [ fig : lp ] ( bottom ) displays the planet s luminosity after bifurcation for selected runs that ended with a @xmath95 planet .",
    "the luminosity peak in run 1 g is higher but narrower than in 10l@xmath79  because the specified hydrodynamic limit to accretion is larger . likewise",
    ", the luminosity peaks for the 3__h _ _ runs are higher and narrower than those of the 3__l _ _ runs because of more rapid gas accretion . slower accretion is also responsible for the slightly lower luminosity peaks for the ` r ' runs compared to the runs with the same viscosity that do not account for disk depletion resulting from planetary accretion .",
    "note that the peak luminosity can be very high , up to @xmath131 in run  1 g , but the width of the peak is very short in runs where the peak is high . during the planet",

    "the rapid gas accretion phase is about the same in all cases ( fig .",

    "the final gravitational potential energy of each of these @xmath95 planets is close to @xmath136 ergs .",
    "the integrated luminosity is significantly less than half the absolute value of the gravitational potential energy because dissociation of hydrogen absorbs a substantial amount of energy ; the virial theorem for self - gravitating bodies is not violated .    the effective temperature of a forming jupiter - like planet is of interest to observers searching from thermal radiation of such objects .",

    "the semimajor axes of the orbits of all but @xmath19 of the @xmath138 known jovian irregular satellites are between @xmath139 and @xmath140 ; the orbital periods of these objects range from @xmath141 months to a little over @xmath19 years .",
    "an object approaching from heliocentric orbit has positive energy with respect to jupiter ( i.e. , the magnitude of their kinetic energy exceeds that of their gravitational binding energy to jupiter ) .",
    "three - body effects caused by the combined perturbations of the sun and jupiter near the boundary of jupiter s hill sphere can reverse this balance , leading to temporary capture into jovocentric orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "permanent capture requires that a non - conservative process acts while the body is in the vicinity of jupiter .",
    "addition of mass to jupiter increases the depth of the planet s gravitational potential well .",
    "jupiter s hill sphere expands ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : rh ] ) , and orbiting objects conserve angular momentum as the planet accretes additional material . assuming that the orbital period of a moon is short compared to the timescale of the increase of the planet s mass , eccentricity is conserved and the semimajor axis of the orbit goes as @xmath142 .",
    "objects captured when jupiter was significantly less massive than it is today thus would orbit well within the current planet s hill sphere , because their immediate post - capture orbits would have been within the smaller hill sphere of the growing planet and the orbits would have shrunk during jupiter s later accretion of matter .",
    "( exceptions would be objects captured into distant quasi - satellite orbits which fortuitously crossed the narrow bridge in phase space connecting them with retrograde orbits as the planet grew and those whose orbits were altered by collisions , etc . )",
    "no proposed mechanism for capture of small satellites by giant planets is fully satisfactory @xcite .",
    "the viability of two of the leading theories for the capture of irregular satellites ( apart from neptune s anomalous large irregular moon , triton ) can be assessed within the framework of our model of giant planet growth .",
    "these capture theories involve : ( i ) reduction of kinetic energy via gas drag within primordial circumplanetary envelopes shortly before these envelopes collapsed @xcite ; and ( ii ) increase in the magnitude of the gravitational potential energy via rapid mass accretion by jupiter @xcite .",
    "@xcite used bodenheimer s ( @xcite ) model of the evolution of giant planet envelopes . according to bodenheimer s model ,",
    "jupiter collapsed hydrodynamically from a size of @xmath143 to @xmath144 on a timescale of @xmath82@xmath19 years , and this process occurred after the planet had reached its present mass , @xmath95 .",
    "planetesimals entering the envelope shortly before this collapse could have lost enough kinetic energy via gas drag to be captured , but not so much as to spiral too deeply into the planet s gravitational potential well .",
    "our present model of giant planet formation differs substantially from that prevailing three decades ago , and we show below that capture of the observed irregular satellites by gas drag in the extended envelope of proto - jupiter is not consistent with the planet growth simulations presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the giant planet formation models presented herein have three major differences from those of @xcite that make irregular satellite capture in the extended and thermally - supported envelope phase difficult .",
    "firstly , the envelope collapses gradually , over a timescale of a few centuries to a few millennia for cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : srp ] , bottom ) in which the most realistic assumptions of the rate that the disk supplies gas to the planet are made ( and over decades in some of the less physically plausible runs ) rather than hydrodynamically ; this makes survival of captured satellites against spiraling into the planet questionable .",
    "secondly , the planet s envelope collapses when the planet s mass is only about @xmath145 ( tables  [ table:3 ] and [ table:4 ] ) ; so orbits of bound bodies would shrink substantially due to the continued accretion of mass by the planet .",
    "thirdly the size of the planet s envelope prior to collapse is only @xmath146 for all runs that use the prescription for planet radius given by the hydrodynamic simulations presented in section  [ sec : envsize ] .",
    "the latter two differences imply that satellites captured during jupiter s extended and thermally - supported envelope phase would orbit far closer to the planets than do the observed irregulars .",
    "the maximum size of the envelope ( which is the size prior to collapse ) is smaller than calculated by @xcite both because the envelope collapses at smaller planetary mass and because in our new models the envelope is restricted by gas flow in the protoplanetary disk to a region only @xmath147th as large as that of their hill radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundtracers ] and [ fig : tracers_xy ] ) .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : srp ] the temporal evolution of a ` scaled radius ' , @xmath148 , which is the post - accretion perijove distance of a body on an orbit just tangent to the outer radius of the protoplanet at the time in question and table  [ table:3 ] ) . for the more viscous case that we studied ,",
    "the planet s mass increases at up to @xmath149% per year . ] . the value of @xmath150 peaks below @xmath151 in all of our runs and below @xmath152 in the most realistic runs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : srp ] , bottom ) .",
    "the simulations of the growth of jupiter presented herein are thus inconsistent with the model of capture of jupiter s irregular satellites within proto - jupiter s distended and thermally - supported envelope .",
    "our calculations do not address ( and therefore do not exclude ) the possibility that the irregular satellites were captured as a result of gas drag within a circumjovian disk .",
    "additionally , the accretion timescale during the epoch when the planet accumulates the bulk of its mass is short compared to the planet s overall growth time , yet too long compared to trapping times for temporary capture of particles by jupiter for the @xcite model to be viable .",
    "we have modeled the growth of jupiter incorporating both thermal and hydrodynamic constraints on its accretion of gas from the circumsolar disk .",
    "our study included simulations of planets growing in disks of high and low viscosity ; the surface mass density of gas within the disk remained constant in some cases and decreased gradually in others ( see table  [ table:1 ] for details ) .",
    "the most physically plausible model of the formation of jupiter included herein is run  3__l__rj , in which the dimensionless disk viscosity is @xmath153 and the surface density of the gas within the disk decreases with time , thereby allowing a gradual tapering off of gas accretion as the planet approaches its ultimate mass .",
    "results of this simulation are presented in figure  [ fig : prc ] .",
    "the principal results of our investigation are : ( 1 ) three dimensional hydrodynamic calculations show that the flow of gas in the circumsolar disk limits the region occupied by the planet s tenuous gaseous envelope to within @xmath1 ( hill sphere radii ) of the planet s center , which is much smaller than the value of @xmath154 that was assumed in previous studies .",
    "( 2 ) this smaller size of the planet s envelope increases the planet s accretion time , but only by @xmath155@xmath156% . in general , in agreement with previous results , jupiter formation times are in the range @xmath157@xmath94 , assuming a protoplanetary disk with solid surface density of @xmath80 and dust opacity in the protoplanet s envelope equal to @xmath19% that of interstellar material . ( 3 ) in a protoplanetary disk whose dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath158 , giant planets grow to several times the mass of jupiter unless the disk has a small local surface density when the planet begins to accrete gas hydrodynamically , or the disk is dispersed very soon thereafter .",
    "the large number of planets known with masses near jupiter compared with the smaller number of substantially more massive planets @xcite is more naturally explained by planetary growth within circumstellar disks whose dimensionless viscosity parameter is @xmath159 .",
