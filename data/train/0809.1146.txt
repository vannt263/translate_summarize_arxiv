    "the chalker - coddington network model @xcite ( c - c model ) is one of the most useful models for describing quantum transport in disordered two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems in strong perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "the c - c model can be extended to describe a system with one perfectly conducting channel ( pcc ) @xcite .",
    "the pcc is a channel whose transmission eigenvalue is one , regardless of the phase of the system .",
    "the pcc in a strong magnetic field can be realized in zigzag graphene nano - ribbons @xcite .",
    "although the original c - c model belongs to the unitary universality class , it is possible to construct network models that belong to the symplectic class @xcite .",
    "the symplectic network model can also be extended to have a pcc of a kramers doublet .",
    "the pcc in the symplectic class appears in metallic carbon nanotubes @xcite .    in this paper , we study how a pcc affects the transport properties in the unitary and symplectic class .",
    "though the models and origins of the pcc are completely different for these two cases , we show that the effects of the pcc are similar .",
    "transport in a network model is described by a scattering matrix @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the incoming / outgoing current amplitude on the left / right terminal of the network .",
    "the dimensionless conductance @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 we have calculated @xmath5 using the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite .      the unitary network model with a pcc ( figure [ unet ] )",
    "is constructed by adding one extra channel to the original c - c model .",
    "the new model has @xmath6 channels ( @xmath7 right - directed and @xmath8 left - directed channels ) . in the unitary case ,",
    "a pcc arises from the imbalance in the number of the incoming and outgoing channels @xcite , leading to a rectangular reflection matrix .              the symplectic network model with a pcc ( figure [ snet ] )",
    "is constructed by adding one extra channel of a kramers doublet ( i.e. , two extra channels of up and down spins moving in opposite directions ) to the symplectic network model proposed in ref .",
    "the new model has @xmath9 channels ( @xmath10 right - directed and @xmath10 left - directed channels ) . in this case",
    ", the reflection matrix is an antisymmetric square matrix with odd dimensions .",
    "this gives rise to the pcc @xcite .    in all cases ,",
    "we have imposed the fixed boundary conditions ( fbc ) in the transverse direction .",
    "conductance distributions in disordered electron systems are universal at the anderson transition points . in the 2d unitary class ,",
    "the network has one transition point at the integer quantum hall transition , irrespective of the existence of the pcc ( number of the pcc @xmath11 ) . in the symplectic class , the network without a pcc ( with fbc ) has two types of transitions @xcite , the metal - insulator and metal - insulator with two kramers pairs of edge states ( i.e. topological insulator ) transition . in this paper , we are not concerned with the latter . on the other hand , the symplectic network with a pcc",
    "has only the metal - insulator with one kramers pair of edge states transition @xcite .",
    "the conductance distribution functions @xmath12 calculated for the unitary and the symplectic class in the square geometry are shown in figures [ p(g)_u ] and [ p(g)_s ] , respectively .",
    "the ensemble averaged conductance @xmath13 and its variance @xmath14 at criticality are listed in table [ g_2d ] . since the pcc raises the minimum conductance to one , the conductance for the network models with a pcc is always larger than one .",
    "the distribution @xmath12 for network models with a pcc differs completely from that for networks without a pcc . for systems with a pcc ,",
    "the conductance distribution rises sharply from @xmath15 .",
    "we also see that the variances for both models are reduced almost by one half when the pcc is added .",

    "the pcc makes the length scale of the conductance decay in a quantum wire shorter .",
    "figures [ x - dep_u ] and [ x - dep_s ] show the dependence on the longitudinal system length @xmath19 of the conductances calculated for the unitary and the symplectic network models , respectively . since the parameters controlling the phases for both models are the same as in the previous section , the conductances at @xmath20 in these figures are consistent with @xmath21 in table [ g_2d ] .",
