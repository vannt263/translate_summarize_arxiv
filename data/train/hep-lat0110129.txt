    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 , we employ the values in the massless limit . we note that our choice of @xmath12 is still correct for massive quarks because it has no mass dependence at the tree level@xcite .",
    "the tadpole factors are determined as @xmath14 with @xmath15 the spatial plaquette and @xmath16 .",
    "simulation parameters are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we adopt lattices with @xmath17 and @xmath18  fm .",
    "runs are made at four values of @xmath19 which correspond to @xmath20 - 0.20  fm .",
    "for each @xmath19 , we measure s- and p - state meson correlation functions at two values of bare quark mass .",
    "results are then inter(extra)polated to the charm quark mass where @xmath21 mass has its experimental value .",

    "e.g. _ splittings between @xmath24 states are well resolved with correct ordering .",
    "the deviation of 2s masses from the experiment is in part ascribed to the quenching effect and in part to contaminations from higher excited states .",

    "effects are very large for the hyperfine splitting .    in the same figure , we also plot results by klassen ( open diamonds ; @xmath27)@xcite and chen ( open triangles ; @xmath28)@xcite with the same action .",
    "their simulations differ from ours in that we determine the tadpole factor @xmath29 from the plaquette average and adopt for the parameter @xmath11 the tree - level tadpole improved value @xmath30 , while they use the mean link in the landau gauge for @xmath29 and a non - perturbative estimate @xmath31 determined from the meson dispersion relation .",
    "nonetheless , their results and ours , using the same scale @xmath32 , all converge to a consistent value of about 70  mev in the continuum limit .",

    "the potential model predicts that the hyperfine splitting is due to the spin - spin interaction of quarks , which originates from the @xmath39 term in the nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "we therefore define a `` tree - level effective hyperfine splitting '' @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the tree level coefficient of the @xmath39 term in @xmath40 .",

    "we find that results of hfs are qualitatively well reproduced by those of @xmath44 . for @xmath35 , @xmath44 remains large even at @xmath47 , which suggests that the actual hfs should rapidly decrease as @xmath48 , and hence a naive estimation @xmath49  mev@xcite from an @xmath26-linear continuum fit is misleading for this case . on the other hand , @xmath44 is already close to unity for @xmath50 for @xmath34 .",
