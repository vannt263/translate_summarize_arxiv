    "<S> in contrast to spatially - homogeneous spectra above @xmath4 , the low - temperature spectra are highly inhomogeneous . note that there is negligible temperature gradient inside the crystal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed inhomogeneity does not originate from the phase separation in the hysteresis region near first - order phase transitions since the resistive hysteresis loop is closed within 10 k near @xmath4 as shown in the inset of fig . </S>",

    "<S> most surprisingly , the dimer - mott state survives even at 10 k far below @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this experimental fact strongly indicates that the phase transition in this material is not driven by entropy term in the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> but rather , this transition seems to occur , when the materials parameters reach a critical value through their temperature variation . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this type of transition is of quantum nature in the sense that the transition is driven by the materials parameters . in the present system </S>",
    "<S> , it has been found that the interdimer transfer integral is doubly increased from room temperature to 11.5 k @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the present compound may locate near the border at low temperatures .    here </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the observed inhomogeneity well explains previous results . </S>",
    "<S> while the peak splitting in the local optical spectroscopy is abrupt @xcite , the superlattice intensity of bulk x - ray measurement exhibits a gradual increase with temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the gradual increase originates from the volume - fraction change of charge - ordered state . below @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic susceptibility sets to a finite value @xcite , indicating the survived dimer - mott state inside the crystal , well consistent with the present results .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally discuss the nucleation mechanism of charge order . in the previous samples , the superlattice peak intensity and the resistivity are gradually increased below 90 k @xcite , while a recent sample of higher quality shows a sharp increase of resistivity at @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this difference may originate from the sample quality . </S>",
    "<S> also , the seeding position of charge order depends on sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we speculate that the seeding is unavoidable crystalline imperfections , as also indicated from other competing correlated system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar nucleation has also been proposed in a ferroelectric relaxor : a polar domain is created near the nano - sized chemically ordering regions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after the nucleation , the charge - ordered state is gradually expanded into the whole region with temperature . in the present compound , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 ( @xmath48 : pressure ) is negative @xcite , indicating that the volume of charge - ordered state is larger than that of dimer - mott state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the induced charge - ordered state pressurizes the dimer - mott state near the boundary locally , leading to @xmath4 reduction in such a boundary region . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a large energy to move the boundary , that may cause the observed macroscopic inhomogeneity .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the infrared measurements on @xmath0-(_meso_-dmbedt - ttf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 reveal anomalous phase transition phenomena from dimer - mott to charge - order state . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a quantum nature of this transition driven by variations of temperature - dependent materials parameters , which possibly induce a spatial inhomogeneity owing to competitive nature between two insulating states </S>",
