    "these are exciting times to be studying how galaxies are made . after a decade of spectacular breakthroughs in physical cosmology , the focus is beginning to shift away from determining the values of the basic cosmological parameters towards attacking the problem of galaxy formation .",
    "a combination of factors is responsible for this change in emphasis .",
    "firstly , the cold dark matter cosmological model has been placed on a much firmer footing by recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation and galaxy clustering .",
    "many of the fundamental cosmological parameters , such as the density of matter , are known to an uncertainty of around 10% .",
    "secondly , the 1990s saw the first detections of sizeable populations of galaxies at high redshifts , allowing evolutionary trends to be established . finally , the increase in readily available computing power coupled with the development of powerful new techniques , such as the subject of this review , semi - analytical modelling of galaxy formation , means that we are in a position to generate accurate predictions for the properties of galaxies in hierarchical cosmologies .",
    "we will elaborate on each of the above points in turn in the introduction .",
    "given these favourable conditions , there is now a genuine chance of making real progress in the advancement of our understanding of the process of galaxy formation .",
    "the aim of this review is to provide an introduction to the ideas and concepts that underpin modern ideas about galaxy formation in a universe in which cosmic structures build up hierarchically through gravitational instability .",
    "the main focus is the semi - analytical approach to modelling galaxy formation .",
    "as we shall see , this technique is currently the most developed theoretical tool available and can be used to make quite detailed predictions of galaxy properties .",
    "it has also enjoyed a large measure of success , though many problems and gaps remain as we will point out .",
    "the intention is to provide a pedagogical overview of this area , which will enable a reader with no prior knowledge of the subject to reach a position from which they are better placed to tackle the more advanced papers in the literature on the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "for this reason , i have sacrificed mathematical detail in favour of trying to provide a verbal description of the relevant physical processes , with the aim of providing a broad view of hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "i have also deliberately avoided undertaking a detailed description of the implementations of various processes in the models , which would serve only to generate long lists of parameter definitions and confusion .",
    "nor do i attempt to carry out a detailed comparison between the published results of different groups .",
    "there are many factors that conspire to make such an exercise largely futile .",
    "papers presenting predictions from semi - analytical models stretch back over 15 years . until very recently , a whole slew of different cosmological models were considered in the literature .",
    "furthermore , different groups have different aims and priorities and set their model parameters according to different criteria .",
    "the models are dynamic entities and as such are continually being improved , as one would expect in a subject in which our current knowledge can at best be described as rudimentary .",
    "instead of making a comparison of the different semi - analytical models , i will concentrate on expounding the principles upon which the models are based , which will hopefully provide a more useful grounding in the physics of galaxy formation and of the philosophy behind the semi - analytical approach .",
    "there are many topics related to hierarchical galaxy formation which i do not have space to cover at anything other than a cursory level in this review .",
    "fortunately , there are now many excellent textbooks which give a formal introduction to the growth of cosmological density perturbations ( for example peebles 1993 , padmanabhan 1993 , peacock 1999 and coles & lucchin 2002 ) . for those readers wanting to find out more about the cosmic microwave background radiation , it is hard to beat a visit to the web site of wayne hu ( http://background.uchicago.edu/  whu/ ) , which contains many lucid explanations , accompanied by neat animations .",
    "the recent review by springel , frenk & white ( 2006 ) provides an introduction to the large scale structure of the universe and the latest attempts to model this using computer simulations .",
    "there are relatively few reviews of the theory of galaxy formation available .",
    "the article by kauffmann & white ( 1994 ) , the les houches lectures by white ( 1994 ) and the recent lecture notes by avila - reese ( 2006 ) cover many of the topics in this review ( and more ) often with a different emphasis and are valuable sources for researchers in galaxy formation .    this review is laid out as follows . in the remainder of the introduction , a few general comments are made to set the scene , building upon the points made in the first paragraph .",
    "the next two sections describe the basic physic processes that underpin models of galaxy formation .",
    "section 2 deals with the less controversial aspects of the modelling which relate to the dark matter component of the universe .",
    "section 3 introduces the more complex physics of the baryonic component .",
    "section 4 compares and contrasts the semi - analytical approach to galaxy formation with direct gas dynamical simulations . in section 5 ,",
    "i review some of the successes and failures of the models , the latter pointing to the areas in which future developments are most likely to be made .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model has steadily gained acceptance since it was first mooted in the early 1980s ( peebles 1982 ; blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 ; davis et al .",
    "the adoption of cdm as the theorist s model of choice can be attributed to three features .",
    "firstly , there are many candidates for the cold dark matter particle predicted by extensions to the standard model of particle physics ; perhaps the most promising of these is the lightest stable supersymmetric particle , the neutralino ( e.g. gondolo 2004 ) .",
    "secondly , the model has tremendous predictive power .",
    "collisionless n - body simulations of the growth of structure in a cdm universe are essentially straightforward to do , given a suitably big and fast computer and an efficient algorithm to compute the gravitational forces between particles .",
    "as we will see later on in this article , the state of the art in numerical simulations allows incredibly detailed predictions to be made for a wide range of properties of the dark matter at all epochs .",
    "the simulation results in turn can be used to calibrate analytical and phenomenological models .",
    "thirdly , and most importantly , many of these predictions have turned out to be impressively successful .",
    "perhaps the most convincing support for the cdm model comes from the measurement of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "the pattern of hot and cold spots in the radiation can be related to density fluctuations present in the universe a mere few hundred thousand years after the big bang , when the radiation and baryon fluids stopped interacting with one another at the epoch of recombination . since the initial detection of these anisotropies on large angular scales by the cobe satellite in 1992 ( smoot et  al .",
    "1992 ) , the power spectrum of the fluctuations has been gradually uncovered , culminating in the clear detection of three doppler peaks due to acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon fluid at the last scattering surface ( de bernardis et  al .",

    "2000 ; hinshaw et  al .",

    "2006 ) .",
    "= 14.truecm = 14.truecm    further compelling support for the cdm model has come recently from two galaxy surveys which have revolutionised our view of the local universe , the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et  al .",
    "2001 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "the unprecedented size of these maps of the galaxy distribution has permitted the most accurate measurements to date of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering ( percival et  al . 2001 ; tegmark et  al .",
    "2004a ; pope et  al .",

    "2006 ) . as an illustration of the accuracy of these measurements ,",
    "the imprint of acoustic oscillations on the matter power spectrum , a much weaker signal than the doppler peaks in the cmb , has now been firmly detected ( cole et  al . 2005 ; eisenstein et  al .",
    "2005 ; padmanabhan et  al . 2006 ; percival et  al .",
    "2006b ) . by confronting the theoretical models with the combined cmb and galaxy power spectrum data ,",
    "the constraints on cosmological parameters can be tightened , through the breaking of certain degeneracies ( efstathiou et  al .",

    "fig : cdm ] for an illustration of how well the cdm model can reproduce the cmb and large - scale structure data ) . by combining the galaxy power spectrum measured from the final 2dfgrs by cole et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) with a compilation of the cmb data available shortly after the release of the first year results from wmap , sanchez et  al . found strong evidence in support of a tilt in the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations , away from the simple scale invariant model ( i.e. a spectral index of scalar fluctuations described by @xmath1 , where the primordial spectrum is described by a power law form , @xmath2 ) , a conclusion which was confirmed upon the analysis of the third year of data from wmap ( spergel et  al .",
    "2006 ) .    despite the burgeoning circumstantial evidence in support of the cdm model",
    ", it should be borne in mind that candidate particles for the non - baryonic dark matter have yet to be detected in the laboratory ( bergstrom 2000 ) .",
    "in the current best fit cdm model , the universe is close to being spatially flat ( e.g. sanchez et  al .",
    ". however , less than 30% of the critical density required for this geometry is contributed by matter .",
    "the remainder is thought to be in some form of `` dark energy '' , one limiting case of which is the cosmological constant ( carroll 2004 ) .",
    "compelling support for a dark energy component came from the deduction that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , based on the hubble diagram of distant type - ia supernovae ( riess et  al .",
    "1998 , 2004 ; perlmutter et  al .",
    "arguments in favour of a universe whose dynamics are currently dominated by a cosmological constant were made some time before the supernovae results , in order to reconcile the measured galaxy clustering with the predictions of cdm ( efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 ) and to match faint galaxy counts ( yoshii & takahara 1988 ; fukugita et  al .",
    "theoretically , the density parameter of the dark energy , at the level implied by astronomical tests is many orders of magnitude smaller than can be motivated from particle physics considerations using dimensional arguments ( carroll 2004 ) .",
    "this theoretical tension has led some authors to consider alternative models without any form of dark energy .",
    "blanchard et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) present a model without dark energy that can reproduce the cmb and galaxy power spectrum data , albeit with an uncomfortably low value for the hubble constant , thus leaving only the supernova observations as evidence in favour of cosmological constant .",
    "another possibility is a modification to the law of gravity on large scales ( deffayet , dvali & gabadadze 2002 ; carroll et  al .",
    "the methodology described in this review is not wedded to cdm ; the calculations can be carried out in any cosmological model in which structure grows hierarchically .",
    "the conclusion is that , within the context of the cdm model , we now have a very good idea of the values of most of the fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "the growth of structure in the dark matter is reasonably well constrained , as we shall see in section  [ dissless ] .",
    "this provides a tremendous fillip to our efforts to understand how galaxies form , as it removes a whole swathe of parameter space , allowing us to concentrate on the more difficult and interesting physics of galaxy formation .",
    "= 14.truecm      the second key advance that makes progress in understanding galaxy formation possible is the unveiling of the high redshift universe in the second part of the 1990s .",
    "observations of galaxies over a range of redshifts allow us to compare their properties at different epochs in the history of the universe .",
    "( for reference , fig .",
    "[ fig : lookback ] shows the age of the canonical cdm model at different redshifts . )",
    "such a comparison can be used to shed light on the formation and evolution of galaxies , and in particular can be used to establish whether galaxy formation is a steady process or if it took place much more vigorously at some earlier epoch .",
    "perhaps the first major breakthrough in characterising the high redshift universe was the hubble deep field ( williams et  al .",
    "1996 ; ferguson , dickinson & williams 2000 ) .",
    "the unprecedented faint imaging of galaxies , combined with the lyman - break dropout technique to isolate high redshift ( @xmath3 ) galaxies ( steidel et  al .",
    "1996 ) was essential in making possible the first determination of the cosmic star formation history over more than 80% of the age of the universe ( madau et  al .",
    "1996 ; ellis 1997 ; steidel et  al .",
    "this approach uses measurements of the rest frame ultra - violet flux from a galaxy to infer the instantaneous star formation rate .",
    "( the uv flux is dominated by stars with masses in excess of several times the mass of the sun ; these stars are also short lived , producing the uv flux for timescales on the order of 10myr . )",
    "one problem with conducting such a census at these wavelengths is that the rest - frame ultra - violet can be strongly attenuated by dust extinction .",
    "technological advances have opened up the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "of particular relevance is the detection of the emission from galaxies at sub - millimetre wavelengths ( smail et  al .",
    "1997 ; barger et  al . 1998",
    "; hughes et  al . 1998 ; for a review of the properties of sub - millimetre galaxies see blain et  al .",
    "submillimetre observations offer the chance of uncovering up heavily extincted galaxies which are too faint to appear in optical surveys",
    ". this emission can arise from starlight or emission from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) that is absorbed by dust and re - radiated at longer wavelengths .",
    "the presence and relative importance of an agn can be constrained by combining sub - millimetre observations with x - ray imaging .",
    "alexander et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) report that practically all objects with sub - millimetre emission contain an agn , but that the star formation in these objects accounts for the bulk of the emission at sub - millimetre wavelengths .",
    "we now give a brief historical sketch of the some of the main ideas that underpin the current paradigm of galaxy formation and show how these led to the development of semi - analytical modelling .",
    "many of these references will be revisited in later sections , where the ideas they put forward will be explained in more detail .",
    "however , it is instructive to point out the chain of key papers responsible for shaping our current understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "the idea that cosmic structures grow through the mechanism of gravitational instability is the oldest part of the paradigm .",
    "the application of perturbation theory and numerical simulations to understanding this process started in earnest in the early 1970s ( see peebles 1980 ) .",
    "gunn & gott ( 1972 ) looked at the growth of clusters through the infall of material , using the spherical top - hat model to track the evolution of the cluster overdensity ( e.g. peacock 1999 ) .",
    "press & schechter ( 1974 ) used the top - hat model to compute the abundance of structures of different masses that form by gravitational condensation in a density field with a gaussian distribution of fluctuations .",
    "the first calculation of the pattern of density fluctuations expected at early times in a cold dark matter universe was made by peebles ( 1982 ; see also bardeen et  al .",
    "the first numerical simulations of the hierarchical growth of structures in a cdm universe were carried out by davis et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) .",
    "two of the core ideas underpinning today s paradigm for galaxy formation can be traced back more than fifty years to fred hoyle ( see efstathiou 2003 for a review of hoyle s work in a modern context ) . hoyle ( 1949 ) was the first to propose that the rotation of galaxies could be generated by the tidal torques which operate during their collapse .",
    "this idea was expanded upon by peebles ( 1969 ) and white ( 1984 ) , and tested with n - body simulations by efstathiou & jones ( 1979 ) ; hoyle also argued that the observed range of galaxy masses could be explained by considering the time taken for gas to cool and condense into galaxies ( hoyle 1953 ) .",
    "this idea was later developed by rees & ostriker ( 1977 ) and silk ( 1977 ) .",
    "white & rees ( 1978 ) presented a synthesis of the theory of press & schechter , which describes the hierarchy of gravitationally bound structures , and the gas cooling arguments used to motivate the observed sizes of galaxies , to produce a model of galaxy formation that set the foundations for today s models .",
    "white & rees proposed that galaxy formation was a two stage process , with dark haloes forming in a dissipationless , gravitational collapse , with galaxies forming inside these structures , following the radiative cooling of baryons .",
    "the additional condensation of the gas through dissipative cooling stabilized galaxies against the disruption caused by the merging of the dark haloes .",
    "white & rees also argued that an additional process , feedback , was needed to make small galaxies more diffuse so that they would be less successful at surviving the merging process , thus avoiding the production of more faint galaxies than are observed .",
    "the first fully fledged semi - analytical model came over ten years after the work by white & rees ( 1978 ) .",
    "white & frenk ( 1991 ) produced a galaxy formation model that included many of the ingredients of today s models : cold dark matter , gas cooling , star formation , feedback and stellar populations ( see also cole 1991 and lacey & silk 1991 ) .",
    "the first models to track the formation and evolution of galaxies in the setting of evolving dark matter haloes came a few years later ( kauffmann et  al . 1993 ; cole et  al .",
    "1994 ) .      at some level numerical simulations and semi - analytical models",
    "have more in common than most people perhaps realise .",
    "there are always aspects of a numerical calculation for which either the resolution becomes inadequate or a complete physical model is simply not available ( e.g. star formation ) ; such phenomena are described as `` sub - resolution '' physics ( springel & hernquist 2003 ) .",
    "these processes can only be dealt with using the same types of recipes employed in semi - analytical modelling .    in the past",
    ", numerical simulations have tended to be more `` photogenic '' than semi - analytical models in the sense that you can see what is happening in a simulation through animations and snapshots .",
    "the seductive power of a movie that shows the evolution of dark matter and galaxies in a simulation can not be overstated , even in the face of the traditionally better developed semi - analytical predictions ( e.g. generating galaxy luminosities with dust extinction as well as star formation histories ) , which allow more direct comparison with observations .",
    "now that semi - analytical models are routinely grafted onto n - body simulations , parity between the two approaches will no doubt ensue in the motion picture industry at conferences .",
    "another problem with the perception of semi - analytical models probably lies with the name `` semi - analytical '' , which some in the community have clearly taken to imply some half - baked witches brew of ingredients , from which any result can be coaxed with a suitable incantation , as and when required to fit new observational data .",
    "there are three points one can make to dispel this misguided notion .",
    "firstly , criticising the models on the grounds that they appear to contain too many free parameters seems unfair .",
    "the models contain parameters simply because of our lack of understanding of the physics underpining galaxy formation .",
    "secondly , it is essential to be clear that the parameters are physical and not statistical .",
    "for instance , the galaxy luminosity function is reasonably well described by the three parameter fit proposed by schechter ( 1976 ) . in this case , the parameter values are set by demanding a good fit to the data .",
    "there is simply not the same freedom to adjust the values of the parameters in a physical recipe , because in this case changing the parameter value has consequences which extend beyond the prediction for the luminosity function .",
    "for example , if the efficiency of gas heating by supernova explosions is increased with the aim of reducing the abundance of faint galaxies , then gas tends to cool more effectively in more massive haloes , with the consequence that the disks of bright spirals are predicted to be larger ( see fig .  8 of cole et  al .",
    "a more powerful model with a wider range of galaxy properties for which predictions can be made has a smaller parameter space available to it than a more naive model .",
    "model parameters are set to match a range of observations as well as possible .",
    "the parameter values required to meet these targets can then be assessed critically , e.g. to see if the amount of energy injection required for a feedback prescription to work is consistent with the number of supernova explosions that have taken place .",
    "thirdly , the recipes used in semi - analytic modelling can be tested against numerical simulations and improved as required .",
    "the results of such comparisons are the subject of section 4 . in that section",
    ", we will discuss an example , the calculation of galaxy sizes and the conservation of angular momentum , where results from semi - analytic modelling have influenced the astrophysics implemented in numerical simulations .",
    "the level of sophistication attained by many current semi - analytical models is a double - edged sword .",
    "one person s admiration at the power of the models and their ability to make a wide range of predictions is tempered by another s impression of unnecessary complexity .",
    "galaxy formation _ is _ complex , involving complicated , nonlinear physics , much of which , as we shall see in later sections , we are only just beginning to get to grips with . in the face of the scepticism the models naturally faced when they were first introduced , there was an onus to show how well the models reproduced different observations .",
    "now that the semi - analytical approach is slowly gaining acceptance , the focus can shift to improving everyone s understanding of how galaxies are made .",
    "one of the great advantages of semi - analytical modelling is that facets of the model can easily be varied or switched on and off to gain a better appreciation of which ingredients have the most bearing on a particular observation .    in the final section of this review",
    ", we will list some of the successes and failures of semi - analytical modelling .",
    "the fact that some observations stubbornly resist reproduction by the models should welcomed , not as an excuse to through away the whole machinery developed to model galaxy formation , but rather as an indication that we may need to include a new physical ingredient in the models .",
    "one such example which was uncovered by semi - analytical models is the difficulty in matching simultaneously the normalisation of the galaxy luminosity function and the zero - point of the luminosity - rotation speed scaling relation for spirals ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et  al .",
    "1994 ) ; this tension lead to variants of the cold dark matter model being explored and new physics being incorporated into the models , such as the calculation of the rotation curve of the model galaxies and the effects of dust extinction .",
    "theories of galaxy formation are driven by observations .",
    "any successful theory needs to explain certain basic measured properties of the galaxy population ; these observations therefore set a challenge to the theorists but also contain important clues about the nature of the galaxy formation process .",
    "to set the scene , we now give a brief list of some fundamental observed properties of galaxies .",
    "these observations are returned to and discussed in more detail in different parts of the review .    *",
    "why is there a characteristic mass for galaxies ?",
    "the most fundamental statistic describing the galaxy population is the luminosity function , a census of the number of galaxies per unit volume as a function of their luminosity .",
    "the luminosity function has a sharp break , brightwards of which the abundance of galaxies falls off exponentially ( norberg et  al .",
    "2002b ; blanton et  al .",
    "the main process driving the growth of cosmic structures , gravitational instability , has no preferred scale , so processes in addition to gravity are responsible for the break .",
    "* why is star formation such an inefficient process ?",
    "only a small fraction of the baryons in the universe ( on the order of @xmath0 ) is locked up in stars ( cole et  al .",
    "2001 ) . where are the remaining baryons ( fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) ?",
    "* why are there remarkably tight correlations between certain galaxy properties ?",
    "spiral and elliptical galaxies exhibit tight correlations between characteristic speeds of internal motion , a structural property , and luminosity , which depends upon the star formation history ( faber & jackson 1976 ; tully & fisher 1977 ; kormendy 1977 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et  al .",
    "another correlation is perhaps fundamental enough to merit its own bullet point : the correlation between the mass of the central supermassive black hole in a galaxy and the mass of the spheroidal component ( magorrian et  al .",
    "why is this relation so tight when there is such a huge difference in the spatial scale of these components ? does this correlation mean that bulges and black holes share a common formation mechanism ?",
    "did the energy released by the accretion of material onto the black hole play a role in the formation of the galaxy ?",
    "* what role does the environment play in galaxy formation ?",
    "the mix of morphological types is strongly dependent on local density , with elliptical galaxies more prevalent than spirals in the cores of clusters ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "the fraction of galaxies contained in groups is expected to grow with time in hierarchical models .",
    "are the physical processes which operate within groups , such as `` strangulation '' or ram pressure stripping , which acts to remove the supply of cold gas in a satellite galaxy , or dynamical effects such as tidal disruption or harassment , responsible for switching off the star formation these galaxies ( gunn & gott 1972 ; moore et  al .",
    "1996 ; balogh et  al . 2004b ; wilman et  al .",
    "2005a ; mayer et  al .",
    "* why do we see significant changes in galaxy properties below a particular galaxy mass ( kauffmann et  al .",
    "2003 ) ? why are there distinct populations or a bimodality in properties such as colour ( e.g. baldry et  al .",
    "* how can we reconcile observations of seemingly massive galaxies at high redshift , some of which are forming stars at prodigious rates , with a universe in which structures grow hierarchically ?",
    "what do the galaxies seen at high redshift turn into by the present day ?",
    "are we seeing the formation of today s elliptical galaxies ? when did the first galaxies begin to form ?",
    "in this section we review the set of ingredients in the recipe for hierarchical galaxy formation that are on the firmest footing and upon which the majority of modellers would agree .",
    "the physics behind the topics discussed in this section is the growth of fluctuations in the dark matter , due to gravitational instability . in the cold dark matter model ,",
    "the process of perturbation growth is dissipationless .",
    "this means that the total kinetic and potential energy of a system of dark matter is retained , although energy can be converted from potential to kinetic .",
    "the candidates for cold dark matter experience only the weak and gravitational forces .",
    "therefore , they can not lose energy through electromagnetic interactions which generate radiation .",
    "our treatment in this section is brief as there are many sources to which the reader can turn for a more rigorous exposition ( e.g. the textbooks by padmanabhan ( 1993 ) and peacock ( 1999 ) give an excellent overview of cosmic structure formation , covering perturbation theory , the spherical top - hat model and press - schechter theory ) .",
    "our starting point is to specify the background cosmology .",
    "the current `` standard '' model is a cold dark matter universe with a cosmological constant ( @xmath4cdm ) .",
    "the initial fluctuations are assumed to follow a gaussian random distribution . once the values of the basic cosmological parameters have been set , such as the density parameter of matter ( @xmath5 ) , the density parameter of baryons ( @xmath6 ) and the current amplitude of density fluctuations on some reference scale , the pattern of primordial density fluctuations is put in place , as described by the linear perturbation theory power spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cdm ] ) and the timetable for their collapse into gravitationally bound structures is set .",
    "dark matter haloes are the cradles of galaxy formation .",
    "hierarchical galaxy formation models require three basic pieces of information about dark matter haloes : ( i ) the abundance of haloes of different masses .",
    "( ii ) the formation history of each halo , commonly called the merger tree .",
    "( iii ) the internal structure of the halo , in terms of the radial density and their angular momentum .",
    "these fundamental properties of the dark matter distribution are now well established , thanks mainly to the tremendous advances made possible by n - body simulations .",
    "the current state of the art in simulations of large scale structure is the virgo consortium s millennium simulation ( springel et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "driven on by the spectacular increase in the available computing power and developments in the algorithms used to compute the gravitational forces between particles , the millennium simulation is a landmark in computational cosmology . coming twenty years after the first calculations of hierarchical clustering in a cdm universe which employed 32,768 particles in a box of side @xmath7mpc ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ) , the millennium simulation volume is @xmath8mpc on a side and uses in excess of ten billion particles to represent the dark matter .",

    "structures of different mass , @xmath11 , could be considered , where @xmath12 .",

    "such processes are included in modern models under the blanket heading of ` feedback ' .",
    "feedback processes arguably have the largest impact on the form of the theoretical predictions for galaxy properties , whilst at the same time being amongst the most difficult and controversial phenomena to model ; a detailed treatment should include a multiphase interstellar medium , with hot , cold and possibly warm gas components , tracking collisions between cold clouds and their evaporation by supernova heating ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ; efstathiou 2000 ; monaco 2004 ) .",

    "both modes of feedback diminish the reservoir of cold gas available to be turned into stars ( see fig  [ fig : stars ] ) .",

    "the gravitational attraction exerted by the mass of the satellite galaxy on its surroundings draws the material in the halo towards it .",
    "this produces a wake of higher density material along the path of the satellite .",

    "the orbital energy of the satellite decays as a result and it spirals in towards the central galaxy ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "a timescale can be computed for the dynamical friction process to remove the orbital energy of the satellite completely .",
    "if this timescale is shorter than the lifetime of the dark halo , then the satellite merges with the central galaxy ( see fig  [ fig : merger ] ) .",
    "in addition to providing an alternative mechanism to gas cooling for increasing the mass and luminosity of the central galaxy , the accretion of a satellite galaxy can have more dramatic consequences . the impact of a galaxy merger is usually quantified by the ratio of the mass of the accreted satellite galaxy to the mass of the central galaxy .",
    "some numerical work exists in which satellites of different mass and gas content have been fired at central galaxies ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1992 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ; walker , mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "however , the range of possible orbits and the parameter space of mass ratios and gas fractions in both the satellite and central galaxies is enormous ; such calculations are computationally expensive and much numerical work remains to be done . typically semi - analytical modellers treat the mass ratio that sets the threshold for a merger to be termed a violent or major merger as a parameter in their models , using the extant numerical simulation results as a guide ( baugh et  al .",

    "the impact of thermal feedback can be increased if the heated gas is only allowed to cool after a delay corresponding to the timescale of stellar associations ( @xmath98myr ; gerritsen 1997 ) or if the supernova heating causes turbulence that adds to the pressure of the gas ( springel 2000 ) .",

    "over the past decade , two serious challenges have emerged to the cold dark matter model : the abundance of sub - haloes in galactic sized haloes ( the `` satellite problem '' ) and the shape of the inner density profile of cold dark matter haloes ( the `` cuspy core problem '' ) .",

    "the number of satellite galaxies detected to date in the local group is over an order of magnitude fewer than would be expected from simple predictions based on the mass and number of dark matter substructures .",
    "the cuspy core problem relates to the steepness of the central density profiles of cold dark matter haloes ( e.g. power et  al .",
    "simple predictions of the rotation curves of cold dark matter haloes fail to match measurements made for a sample of low surface brightness galaxies dominated by dark matter , implying that the cdm haloes are too cuspy ( moore et  al .",
    "these two challenges to the cold dark matter model have generated a huge amount of interest .",
    "two types of solution have been proposed .",
    "the first class focuses on modifying the properties of the dark matter particle .",
    "the problem of the over - abundance of low mass haloes and the cuspy inner density profiles of dark matter haloes can both be addressed by reducing the amount of small scale power below that predicted by the cold dark matter model .",
    "possible ways to achieve this which have been put forwards include self - interacting dark matter ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) and replacing the cold dark matter by warm dark matter ( e.g. bode , ostriker & turok 2001 ) .",
    "changing the nature of the dark matter has the drawback that it will be harder to account for the reionisation of the universe at high redshift ( e.g. spergel et  al .",
    "2003 ) ; if the level of density fluctuations is reduced on small scales , then there will be fewer low mass haloes at high redshift , delaying the formation of the more massive structures which host the galaxies that produce large quantities of ionising photons .",
    "the second type of solution is to retain the cold dark matter framework whilst improving the treatment of the astrophysical phenomena which may influence the predictions of the model on these scales .",
    "for example , the number of luminous satellites within galactic haloes can be strongly affected by a number of processes : supernova feedback , the impact of a photoionising background on galaxy cooling and dynamical processes such as ram pressure stripping ( e.g. benson et  al .",

    "any phenomenon which leads to a model successfully matching the observed break in the luminosity function uses up a dangerously high fraction of the energy released by supernova explosions .",

    "the total angular momentum of the gas is conserved as it cools to form a disk , but no attention is paid to the direction of the angular momentum vector . in numerical simulations , the angular momentum vector of a galaxy is seen to change orientation after merger events , which could explain some of the difficulties in finding galaxies of the observed radius ( okamoto et  al .",

    "( 2006 ) find good agreement with the estimated stellar mass function up to @xmath108 , with more massive objects in place at earlier times than is predicted by previous versions of the durham model .",
    "again , caution should be exercised when comparing model predictions for the stellar mass function with observational estimates .",
    "drory , bender & hopp ( 2004 ) showed how estimates of the stellar mass from broad band photometry at low redshift compare with dynamical estimates .",
    "eke et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) repeated this test for the durham semi - analytic model , in which case the true stellar mass is known a priori .",
    "both studies show that there is a scatter and systematic differences between the mass estimated from photometry and the dynamical ( drory , bender & hopp 2004 ) or true stellar mass ( eke et  al .",
    "both effects are likely to increase in the case of optical and near infra - red photometry of high redshift galaxies , as a result of the wavelength coverage shifting towards the rest frame ultra - violet as the redshift at which the galaxy is observed increases .",
    "the model predictions should be convolved with the estimated errors in the stellar mass determination , which could have a significant impact upon the high mass end of the mass function , before comparing with the observational estimates .",
    "the goal of this review was to provide an overview of the physics of hierarchical galaxy formation and , in doing so , to convince the reader that semi - analytical models provide a powerful , complementary approach to studying galaxy formation to that offered by numerical simulations .",
    "the semi - analytical models currently provide the most detailed and complete predictions for the properties of the galaxy population in cold dark matter universes .",
    "the modular framework of the models means that it is straightforward to revise the description of the various phenomena , as required to reproduce the results of more detailed ( and expensive ) numerical simulations or as motivated by the need to reproduce new observations . in the future",
    ", the semi - analytical models will become more intimately linked with dark matter only n - body simulations , either the next generation of post - millennium , high resolution simulations of cosmologically significant volumes or ultra - high resolution resimulations of individual dark matter structures .",
    "there is still a long way to go , but armed with this theoretical machinery and the ever increasing data on the high redshift data universe , these are promising times for advancing our understanding of how galaxies are made .",
