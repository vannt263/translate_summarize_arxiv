    "as the sole parameter of the underlying theory of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the baryon - to - photon density ratio , @xmath2 , is one of the holy grails of cosmology . in the past ,",
    "@xmath3 was best determined by the concordance of the four light element isotopes produced by bbn , d , 3 , 4 , and 7 ( walker 1991 ; schramm & turner 1998 ; olive , steigman , & walker 2000 ; nollett & burles 2000 ; cyburt , fields , & olive 2001 ; coc 2002 ; fields & sarkar 2002 ) . as the systematic uncertainties in the abundance determination of each of these isotopes are becoming better understood",
    ", it seems that our ability to ` predict ' a precise value of @xmath3 diminishes .",
    "perhaps , our best hope for an accurate determination of @xmath3 lies with the analysis of the microwave background anisotropy power spectrum . from this independent determination",
    ", we can certainly expect to gain a substantial amount of insight in the systematic effects involved in the abundance measurements ( kneller 2001 ; cyburt , fields , & olive 2002 ) .",
    "of course , the concordance of bbn ( within known uncertainties ) remains a critical test of the standard cosmological model up to temperature scales of order @xmath4 mev .",
    "needless to say , bbn continues to provide countless constraints on particle physics models which affect the evolution of the universe at that epoch .",
    "it is in this context that bania ( 2002 ) have recently measured 3/h in about 20  regions in the galactic disk .",
    "these data show almost no variation over the metallicity range [ o / h ] = @xmath5 to + 0.2 , i.e. a ` plateau ' in [ 3/h ] vs [ o / h ] . using recent developments of the stellar evolution theory ,",
    "these authors have set an upper limit to the primordial 3 abundance of @xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath7 of about 0.02 .",
    "bania  argue that the upper limit is robust despite the uncertainties in the details of 3 evolution ; this robustness is argued to restore 3 as a bbn baryometer .",
    "however , in the nineties severe doubt was cast regarding the use of 3 as a baryon density indicator due to the large uncertainties in its production in low mass stars .",
    "standard stellar theory for low mass stars ( see e.g. iben & truran , 1978 ) predicts a significant amount of production in these stars . when incorporated into simple models of galactic chemical evolution",
    ", one would expect 3 abundances in great excess from those observed ( vangioni - flam 1994 ; olive 1995 ; galli 1995 ; scully 1996 , 1997 ; dearborn , steigman , & tosi 1996 ) .",
    "while it is quite possible that additional 3 destruction mechanisms ( charbonnel 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ; hogan 1995 ; wasserburg , boothroyd , & sackmann 1995 ) can lead to a consistent picture for the evolution of 3 ( olive 1997 ; galli 1997 ) , one must argue that the new process is not operative in all stars in order to avoid a contradiction between a few planetary nebulae showing high 3 abundances ( from 2 to @xmath8 , balser 1997 ; balser , rood , & bania 1999 ) and  regions with small 3 content ( about @xmath9 , balser 1999 ) .",
    "the  region observations are in good agreement with the protosolar abundance value @xmath10 ( geiss & gloeckler 1998 , gloeckler & geiss 1998 ) .",
    "the problem of 3 therefore seemed to be one of stellar and/or galactic in nature .",
    "for this reason , it was deemed to be a poor cosmological tracer .",
    "recently , the conclusion that 3 is not significantly produced in stars has been corroborated by a wealth of observations of 13 anomalies in low mass rgb stars and in some planetary nebulae .",
    "the rgb @xmath11 anomalies point out the existence of extra mixing process in low mass stars ( charbonnel & do nascimento 1998 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1999a , 1999b and references therein ) . in this context ,",
    "the mechanism responsible for the low @xmath11 observed in most of the rgb stars should lead to destruction of 3 in the external layers .",
    "the very large fraction of stars experiencing this phenomenon ( of order 90 % ) seems to prevent the overproduction of 3 in the course of galactic evolution . in addition",
    ", the 12/13 ratio has been recently observed in planetary nebulae . while palla et al .",
    "@xcite find high 12/13 inconsistent with mixing in one object , palla et al .",
    "@xcite find that most of 12/13 ratios in a sample of 14 planetary nebulae are low , implying that extra mixing has occurred .",
    "balser , mcmullin , & wilson ( 2002 ) reach a similar conclusion in a study of 11 planetary nebulae .",
    "these theoretical and observational results thus represent impressive progress in resolving the 3 problem , and further studies are likely to clarify the situation more .",
    "this rapid progress has reopened the question of whether 3 can be restored as a probe of the cosmic baryon density . it will be shown below that the present results are not sufficient by themselves to constrain the galactic evolution of 3 and hence its primordial abundance .",
    "consequently , it appears necessary to take a careful look at this problem , integrating the available data in a galactic evolutionary model to reevaluate quantitatively the cosmological status of 3 . in section 2 , we briefly review the most recent developments in bbn that will be used in the present work . in section 3 ,",
    "the evolution of 3 is traced in the framework of a galactic evolutionary model in order to analyze the potential production / destruction of 3 in stars .",
    "we find that present observations and theory can not yet sufficiently constrain the primordial abundance of 3 at the needed precision . in section 4 , we take advantage of recent cmb observations ( and the derived value of @xmath12 ) to draw some consequences on primordial 3 and its evolution . our summary and conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "standard bbn has been recently updated using new reaction rate compilations ( nacre in particular , angulo 1999 ) .",
    "independent results of this update are in good agreement ( vangioni - flam 2000 , cyburt 2001 , coc 2002 ) and will be used here . from the primordial abundance of 3 deduced by bania ( 2002 ) 3/h @xmath13",
    ", we derive through the bbn calculations the corresponding baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath14 , as well as the d , 4 , and 7 primordial abundances .",
    "these values are given in table 1 .",
    "the last column presents the stellar destruction factor of 7 required to bring the primordial abundance down to the spite plateau ( see e.g. , spite 1996 ) .",
    "here we have taken the plateau value to be @xmath15 ( ryan 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , we explore a more extended range in @xmath16 taking into account the more conservative limits of bania ( 2002 ) .",
    "the models we consider cover the range @xmath16 = 2.2 to 6.5 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ a _ : mass fraction + _ b _ : number with respect to h + _ c _ : the stellar destruction factor that would be needed to bring li down to the observed spite plateau .",
    "each of the light elements can be individually used to determine @xmath17 with varying accuracy .",
    "table 1 illustrates the weak dependence of 3 on @xmath3 : a factor of 2 variation in 3 corresponds to a factor of 3 variation in @xmath3 .",
    "this already foreshadows the difficulty of using 3 to determine the baryon density .",
    "4 displays an even weaker , logarithmic dependence on density , so that very accurate abundance measurements are necessary to use 4 as a baryometer . at present ,",
    "systematic uncertainties make it difficult to exclude values of y as high as 0.25 ( olive & skillman , 2001 ) thus allowing @xmath18 .",
    "with 7 one can do much better . a plateau value of @xmath19 corresponds to @xmath20 and 3.2 .",
    "however , the slightly higher value of @xmath21 ( consistent within systematic uncertainties ) yields @xmath22 and 4.3 .",
    "indeed , the question of the lithium depletion during the pre - main sequence and main sequence phases of stellar evolution has been a long standing problem .",
    "historically , the range of possible depletion factors has been steadily decreasing over the years .",
    "some ten years ago , it ranged from about 0.2 dex in standard non rotating stellar models to an order of 1 dex in models with rotational mixing ; now , the estimated depletion factor lies between 0.2 and 0.4 dex ( pinsonneault 1999 , 2001 ) . while there is no lack of processes which could lead to lithium depletion in the envelope of stars : mixing induced by rotation , microscopic diffusion and mass loss ( vauclair & charbonnel 1998 ; theado & vauclair 2001 ) , however , none of these processes are free from objection ; more specifically , the understanding of the behavior of the angular momentum vs radius and time and its transport is far from complete .",
    "independent of these theoretical arguments , the observational data indicate very little if any depletion of li .",
    "first , there is the total lack of dispersion ( beyond observational uncertainty ) in the lithium data ( bonifacio & molaro 1997 ; ryan , norris , & beers 1999 ; ryan 2000 ) , and second , recent 6 observations also leave little room , if any , for 6 depletion ( fields & olive 1999 ; vangioni - flam 1999 ) .    in contrast , the strong dependence of d / h on @xmath3 makes deuterium a very good baryometer , provided we have an accurate determination of d / h .",
    "the values of d / h measured in high redshift systems however cover the range @xmath23 for @xmath24 to @xmath25 for @xmath26 ( burles & tytler 1998a , 1998b , tytler 2000 , omeara 2001 , dodorico 2001 , pettini & bowen 2001 ) .",
    "we note that if the dispersion in the d / h is real ( beyond observational error as the quoted error bars imply ) , then one can question the extent that any of these determinations truly represent the primordial d / h abundance and some amount of d / h must have been destroyed , presumably by stellar processing . since @xmath27 is monotonically decreasing in time , the primordial value should be greater than or equal to the maximum of the observed values ( fields 2001 ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to check the viability of 3 as a baryometer . in this context",
    ", we have run standard galactic evolutionary models which in essence follow the evolution of the abundance of the elements in the ism , and thus of the  regions , starting from their estimate of primordial abundances ( table 1 ) .",
    "five models are considered with 3 primordial abundances varying from 0.9 to 1.9 @xmath28 ( corresponding @xmath29 to 2.2 ) .",
    "relying on recent work concerning the behaviour of 3 in stars , we attribute only moderate production of 3 in stars with masses between 1 and 3 m@xmath30 indeed , the rare observations of 3 in planetary nebulae ( balser 1997 , 1999 ) lead to 3/h @xmath31 .",
    "as pointed out by olive ( 1997 ) and galli ( 1997 ) on the basis of galactic evolutionary models , only a limited fraction of low mass stars can be 3 producers .",
    "this conclusion has been recently corroborated by stellar evolutionary models ( charbonnel & do nascimento 1998 and sackmann & boothroyd 1999 ) implying a fraction of about 10 % for 3 producers . in this context , the 3 yields are taken to be 1 to 5 @xmath32 m@xmath30 in the mass range considered above . however , due to the inherent uncertainties in the physics governing 3 production , there is obviously a certain amount of leeway on the yields which does not impact our general conclusions as shown below .",
    "the evolution of 3 and li vs [ o / h ] and [ fe / h ] respectively , is shown in figure 1 over four decades in metallicity , for the five models considered .",
    "as one can see , the 3 data alone can not discriminate between the five models chosen .",
    "the scatter in the points ( whether real or observational ) makes it difficult to infer a mean 3 evolutionary trend .",
    "in addition , the relatively narrow range in metallicity reduces the `` leverage '' of the data to reveal any trend . for",
    "both of these reasons , the 3 data alone do not allow one to extract a narrow range in @xmath16 .",
    "the lithium data are more discriminative , and in particular , one model ( the solid curve corresponding to 3/h@xmath33 ) appears to be problematic and would require a depletion factor greater than 3 .",
    "the flat behaviour of 3 vs [ o / h ] in the halo phase is due to the lack of production of 3 in massive stars .",
    "the moderate increase in the disc phase is due to the release of 3 by low mass stars .",
    "figure 2 zooms in on the results corresponding to the observational range for [ o / h ] .",
    "note that the higher the primordial 3 the flatter the evolutionary curve in the disc , for the same given contribution of low mass stars .",
    "note that , for a given 3 primordial value , if we had chosen a lower 3 yield , still consistent with the planetary nebula data , the evolutionary curve would also be flatter .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we consider a model with total stellar destruction of 3 as in case of deuterium and compare it with models discussed above . in figure 3",
    ", we see that one can not discriminate between the two evolutionary assumptions .",
    "we show the corresponding results of models 1 , 3 and 5 .",
    "the conclusion that one can draw is simply that the current data are too scattered to derive significant constraints on @xmath3 , notwithstanding the uncertainties in the stellar 3 production / destruction in low mass stars .",
    "the very existence of large 3 abundances in some planetary nebulae , however , favors a slight ( but rare ) production of 3 , without implying any consequence on cosmology .",
    "the analytic expressions for the chemical evolution of 3 give some additional insight into the observed trends .",
    "the mass fraction @xmath34 of 3 evolves in a closed - box model as @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are the usual mass and 3 ejection functions ( which includes deuterium - processing ) , and we have @xmath38 the imf , @xmath39 the star formation rate , and @xmath40 the stellar lifetime .",
    "this expression can be recast as @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dxdt ] ) we see that 3 is driven from its initial value towards a steady state @xmath44 , in which @xmath34 approaches @xmath45 ; this equilibrium value retains no memory of the primordial abundance .",
    "if the primordial value @xmath46 is higher ( lower ) than @xmath45 , then the abundance will , over a timescale @xmath47 gyr , be driven down ( up ) to the equilibrium value .",
    "the apparent flatness of 3 versus o / h may suggest that such an equilibrium has already been reached . or course ,",
    "if the primordial value happens to be @xmath48 , then the 3 abundance will change very little over time .",
    "note that if one could firmly establish observationally that 3 definitely increases ( decreases ) with time , then as bania et al .",
    "@xcite argue , one could use the observed 3 data to place an upper ( lower ) limit on the primordial value .",
    "this is possible if one could determine the sign of @xmath49 , perhaps by measurement of 3 in an appropriate sample of planetary nebulae .",
    "the limit one could derive on 3 would still suffer from the flatness of 3 versus @xmath3 , so that 3 would not be a precision baryometer . on the other hand , precisely because of this flatness , a firm limit on primordial 3 would provide a useful consistency check on the baryon density arrived at by other means . indeed , with a determination of the baryon density , 3 observations become very interesting for other reasons , to which we now turn .",
    "cmb anisotropy data is now reaching the precision where it can provide an accurate measure of the cosmic baryon content .",
    "this independent measure of @xmath3 will test cosmology and will probably revolutionize bbn . given a cmb measurement of @xmath3 , and presuming a bbn - cmb concordance",
    ", one can turn the usual bbn problem around and predict the primordial abundance of 3 .",
    "because of the small 3 variation with @xmath3 , the cmb data will provide a very precise prediction .",
    "indeed , an interesting prediction is already possible .",
    "recent results from dasi ( pryke 2002 ) and cbi ( sievers 2002 ) indicate that @xmath50 , while boomerang-98 ( netterfield 2002 ) gives @xmath51 .",
    "these determinations are somewhat lower than value found by maxima-1 ( abroe 2002 ) @xmath52 and vsa ( rubio - martin 2002 ) @xmath53 . taking a cmb value of @xmath54 , or @xmath55 ( 1 @xmath56 )",
    ", we would predict a primordial 3 value of 3/h in the range 0.87 to 1.04 @xmath28 with a central value of 0.94 @xmath28 , already a prediction good to about 10 % . with map data ,",
    "the accuracy of @xmath57 should be @xmath58 or better , which will give a 3 prediction to @xmath59 or better .    this primordial 3 abundance , while only one number , provides a powerful probe for both chemical evolution and stellar evolution .",
    "the primordial value provides a starting point from which observed 3 has evolved with metallicity .",
    "using chemical evolution to model the mean 3-o trend , as we have done here , one can now probe stellar evolution .",
    "anchored at the initial 3 value , different stellar yield assumptions will lead to strongly different present values , allowing one a new means of constraining possible stellar mixing models .",
    "in addition , with a known primordial 3 , one can then compare with individual observations in  regions , and determine whether 3 has increased or decreased in that particular system .",
    "either way , this makes a statement about the interplay of stellar and  region evolution , which one can model to understand the scatter of individual regions from the mean 3-metallicity trend .",
    "such an analysis might be reminiscent of those proposed to explain scatter in 4-metal trends in  regions ( e.g. , garnett @xcite ; pilyugin @xcite ) .",
    "considerable observational and theoretical progress has recently been made in understanding the stellar and galactic evolution of 3 .",
    "these studies have gone far to address the apparent dichotomy between the high 3 values measured in some planetary nebulae , and the much lower values seen  regions . detailed stellar evolution models , and observations of carbon isotopes in red giants and planetary nebulae ,",
    "strongly suggest that an extra mixing process is responsible for the destruction of 3 in 90% of low mass stars ; thus the apparent observational inconsistency is removed . a key new contribution to this emerging picture",
    "are the bania et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measurements 3 over a range of metallicity ; the observed lack of strong 3 evolution with oxygen confirms that the production of 3 by low mass stars is very limited .",
    "this progress in stellar physics notwithstanding , the remaining observational and theoretical uncertainties surrounding 3 evolution leave this isotope poorly - suited to be the precision baryometer found in 7 and especially d. on the other hand , 3 nevertheless remains extremely interesting as an astrophysical probe .",
    "more data will increase its value .",
    "for example , an unbiased survey of 3 in planetary nebulae will shed light on whether 3 is increasing or decreasing from its primordial value .",
    "moreover , the cmb results on @xmath3 allow one to predict primordial abundances quite accurately for 3 and the other light isotopes",
    ". this will cast the  region 3 data in a new light , allowing these data to constrain both stellar and chemical evolution .",
    "thus , we foresee a promising future for 3 , and urge that the longstanding 3 observational program continue with renewed vigor .    we warmly thank olivier dor and anuj sarma for helpful discussions .",
