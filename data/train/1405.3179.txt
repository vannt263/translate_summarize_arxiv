    "resonant metallic nanoantennas in the optical regime have generated much interest over the last decade due to their ability to confine light to deep subwavelength dimensions@xcite .",
    "in particular , coupled nanoparticle dimers are of interest since they provide a large electric field enhancement within the feed gap@xcite .",
    "this effect holds great promise for new applications in sensing@xcite and in fluorescence enhancement,@xcite as well as for emission control@xcite of single molecules and quantum emitters .",
    "triangular - shaped nanoparticles in a tip - to - tip configuration , the so - called bowtie nanoantenna , are used to take advantage of the lightning rod effect .",
    "the optical response of such plasmonic nanopantennas has been studied as a function of different geometrical parameters such as size@xcite , feed gap@xcite and shape@xcite , materials@xcite and wavelength range@xcite . beside the widely used glass substrates , plasmonic nanoparticles",
    "have also been investigated on semiconductor substrates like si or gaas with relation to their use in photovoltaic applications@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been theoretically shown that the use of high refractive index substrates such as semiconductors can boost the radiative decay rate of quantum emitters by a factor of > 7500 when the optical and geometrical properties of the quantum emitters and plasmonic nanoantenna are properly engineered@xcite .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive study of the optical properties of lithographically defined gold bowtie nanoantennas on gaas .",
    "the results obtained are compared to nominally identical structures on glass to gain deeper insights into the effect of the high refractive index substrate on the plasmonic response in the optical regime .",
    "complementary finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) simulations were employed to find the optimized thickness ( t ) of the structures and to compare our experimental findings with predictions based on classical electrodynamics .",
    "we optically probed the surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) frequency using white light reflectivity as the size ( s ) , feed gap ( g ) and the polarization of the incident electromagnetic field ( @xmath3 ) are varied .",
    "the spr shifts linearly from 1.08ev to 1.58ev when decreasing the triangle size from 170 nm to 100 nm on gaas , similar to the shift measured on glass over the same range .",
    "we observe a near uniform redshift of 0.25@xmath00.05ev upon moving from glass to gaas substrates .",
    "furthermore , the spr strongly depends on the feed gap between the two triangles . with decreasing feed gap size",

    "nm was found to be 0.03ev on gaas , much smaller that the 0.20ev observed on glass , indicative of a weaker coupling strength due to the presence of the high refractive index substrate .",
    "we quantified this interparticle coupling to be @xmath18@xmath2 lower on gaas compared to a glass substrate when probing the coupled and uncoupled mode of the bowtie using polarization resolved measurements .",

    "gold bowtie nanoantennas were defined on undoped gaas [ 100 ] substrates using standard electron beam lithography . as depicted schematically in fig .",

    "we chose a pitch of to avoid near - field coupling between two adjacent bowties@xcite whilst retaining the possibility to address single bowties with a focused laser beam in future experiments .    prior to the fabrication process",
    ", we performed fdtd simulations using a commercially available software package ( lumerical solutions , inc.@xcite ) to identify the optimum thickness of the au - film used to define our nanostructures . for future combination with semiconductor quantum emitters such as ingaas quantum dots@xcite",
    ", it is highly desirable to overlap the bowtie s surface plasmon resonance with the emission range of the dots at @xmath11.3ev while preserving a high electric field enhancement within the feed gap@xcite .",
    "[ sample](b ) shows a typical result of the simulated electric field enhancement , defined as the ratio of the intensity of the electric field @xmath6 2 nm above the the bowtie surface compared to the intensity of the incoming plane wave @xmath7 .",
    "the simulation was performed for a single bowtie ( s=110 nm , g=10 nm ) and probed at the electric dipole resonance @xmath8=1.33ev . here",
    ", we observe that the e - field is mostly concentrated in an area of @xmath130@xmath230nm^2^ with electric field enhancements up to a factor of @xmath9=180@xmath2 using the definition specified above .",
    "the inset shows the cross section of the field amplitude along the dashed line at y=0 nm on a linear scale .",
    "we calculated that 79% of the intensity along this curve is concentrated within a region of size -15nm@xmath10x@xmath1015 nm .",
    "hence , the bowtie geometry is capable of focusing light into spatial regions , similar to the lateral dimension of a single self - assembled ingaas quantum dot@xcite . besides the electric field distribution , we also calculated the scattering cross section @xmath11 of the nanoantenna , which is defined as p=@xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the intensity of the used total field scattered field ( tfsf ) source and p the measured power of the monitors that completely envelope the bowtie .",
    "plotting @xmath11 as a function of the photon energy yields the spectral position of the electric dipole resonance energy , which is strongly influenced by the size@xcite , feed gap@xcite , shape@xcite , and dielectric environment@xcite of the plasmonic dimer .",

    "[ sample](c ) .",
    "in addition , we obtained a redshift of the spr peak position from 1.33ev down to 1.29ev when decreasing the metal film thickness . for even smaller t ,",
    "the redshift becomes more prominent and leads to spr peak at 0.80ev for 5 nm thick structures . in order to achieve the best resolution during the electron beam lithography , resulting in sharp tips and small feed gaps and , therefore , a high electric field enhancement",
    ", the structures should be as thin as possible@xcite .",
    "taking into account the measured redshift of 0.25@xmath00.05ev introduced by the gaas substrate ( see below ) , an additional redshift of 0.3 - 0.5ev by a very thin structure would require very small particle sizes , of the order of 50 nm , to match the spr and the quantum dot s emission range .",
    "smaller particles , however , show a lower scattering to absorption ratio@xcite and are , therefore , not ideal . hence , we chose a au thickness of 35 nm representing the best trade - off between high resolution and optimum scattering properties .",
    "[ sample](d ) and ( e ) show a typical scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) image of the fabricated arrays and a close - up of a single bowtie on gaas , respectively . using a 35 nm thick au - film",
    "we could reproducibly fabricate feed - gaps and tip radii ( r ) as small as 10 nm with a yield of almost 100% even without using an adhesion layer .",
    "all triangles are equilateral and we define the size of a bowtie as the height of one individual nanotriangle composing the bowtie antenna . to study the influence of the high refractive index substrate ( @xmath14=3.54 @ t=297k and @xmath15=1.3ev@xcite ) in more detail , we also fabricated reference structures on glass substrates ( @xmath16=1.52 @ @xmath15=2.1ev@xcite ) , as shown in the sem image in fig .",
    "[ sample](f ) .",
    "the geometrical properties are nominally identical to the ones on gaas except for the presence of a 5 nm thick titanium adhesion layer below the 35 nm au - film .",
    "the achieved resolution is slightly reduced due to the non - conductive substrate which is disadvantageous for the electron beam lithography .",
    "further details on the fabrication process are presented in the methods section .    to optically probe the spr and scattering cross section of our structures we used a room temperature white light @xmath17-reflectivity setup .",
    "light from a halogen lamp was polarized along the bowtie axis @xmath18 , focused on the sample surface , spectrally analyzed in a 0.5 m spectrometer and detected with a liquid nitrogen cooled charge coupled device ( ccd ) camera .",
    "thereby , we recorded a reflectivity spectrum from the bowtie array ( s^bt^(@xmath19 ) ) and a reference spectrum from the bare substrate directly adjacent to the bowtie array ( s^ref^(@xmath19 ) ) .",
    "we then normalize the two data sets according to i(@xmath19)=[@xmath20 representing a measure of the reflectivity change caused by the bowties .",
    "this method reveals the scattering spectrum and , therefore , the spr frequency of the probed structures .",
    "the spot size was determined to be 9@xmath17 m , such that we probe @xmath130 bowties simultaneously leading to good statistics with a single measurement .",
    "however , as we observe small fabrication imperfection ( @xmath1010 nm ) from sem images , it is highly likely that all spectra are inhomogeneously broadened .",
    "a detailed study of the plasmonic response of the nanoanteannas for different geometrical parameters is presented in this section .",
    "although the focus is on the high refractive index , semiconducting gaas substrate , we compare our results to these measured for similar structures on a glass substrate .",
    "typical normalized differential reflectivity spectra obtained for bowtie arrays on gaas with g=20@xmath05 nm and varying triangle sizes are shown in fig .",
    "[ spr](a ) .",
    "as expected , the scattering cross section and , therefore , the measured relative differential intensity decreases with decreasing structure sizes , whereas the spr peak energy increases@xcite .",
    "compared to the spectra recorded on glass , shown in fig .",
    "[ spr](b ) , the relative intensity is @xmath15@xmath2 lower due to the enhanced reflectivity of the gaas substrate , e.g. 0.08 compared to 0.42 for s=150 nm . for both substrates the resonances have a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.4@xmath00.1ev corresponding to a dephasing time of 3.3@xmath00.8fs , in good agreement with values reported in the literature@xcite .    the spr peak energy as a function of the triangle size is plotted in fig .",
    "[ spr](c ) and ( d ) for gaas and glass , respectively . for g=20 nm ,",
    "we observe a linear shift from 1.57@xmath00.02ev to 1.08@xmath00.01ev when changing the triangles size from 100 nm to 170 nm on gaas .",
    "these values translate to a shift rate of 7.0@xmath00.5mev / nm .",
    "a qualitatively similar trend is observed on glass . here , the spr shifts from 1.63@xmath00.04ev to 1.25@xmath00.01ev when tuning the triangle size from 115 nm to 180 nm , corresponding to a shift rate of 5.9@xmath00.8mev / nm .",
    "thus , we found shift rates which are similar within the error and a red shift of the spr by 0.25@xmath00.05ev between the different substrates for s=150 nm and g=20 nm .",
    "this observation is attributed to the higher refractive index of gaas@xcite as compared to glass .",
    "all results obtained on glass are supported quantitatively by our fdtd simulations , whereas on gaas we find good qualitative agreement .",
    "for all simulations , we used a triangle tip radius r=20 nm instead of the experimental observed 10 nm .",
    "this is not expected to have any strong quantitative impact on our simulation results due to inhomogeneities of the triangle size ( @xmath05% ) that dominate the spr frequency .",
    "we note that the native oxide layer on top of our gaas wafers is included in the simulation since it strongly influences the plasmonic properties@xcite due to its much lower refractive index @xmath21@xmath11.5 as compared to the gaas substrate @xmath14@xmath13.5 . by selectively etching the oxide away at a certain region of the sample and performing atomic force microscopy measurements , we determined the thickness of the oxide layer to be 3.5@xmath01 nm , in very good agreement with values reported in the literature @xcite . from our simulations ( data not shown )",
    "we expect a blue shift of the spr on gaas by 0.18ev due to the presence of a 4 nm thin oxide layer .",
    "another possibility to influence the spr is to vary the feed gap .",
    "this leads to a red shift of the spr with decreasing gap for both substrates due to the increased coupling between the triangles .",
    "this mechanism lowers the effective restoring force of the oscillating free electron plasma in the nanoparticles and , therefore , decreases the resonance energy@xcite . to investigate this coupling effect in more detail",
    ", we experimentally and theoretically studied the spr as a function of g for different triangle sizes .",
    "the results obtained on gaas are plotted in fig .",
    "[ spr](e ) .",
    "all curves follow a g^-3 ^ -dependence , which can be derived from the simple qualitative picture of two interacting dipoles@xcite .",
    "this behavior , which originates from the cubic decay of the near field of a point dipole@xcite , is also measured on a glass substrate .",
    "however , we observe a clear difference between the two material systems .",
    "whilst for gaas the spr only starts to shift when the gap becomes smaller than g=20 nm , we already observe a change at g=50 nm for glass substrates .",
    "furthermore , the absolute shift of 0.20ev when decreasing the gap from g=80 nm to g=10 nm is almost one order of magnitude lager for glass compared to 0.03ev for gaas .",
    "all experimental observations are again confirmed by our fdtd simulations , which agree well with the measured data ( solid lines - fig .",
    "[ spr](e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "the obtained results indicate a weaker coupling between the individual bowtie triangles on gaas . this could be related to increased damping of the surface plasmon due to the higher refractive index substrate . however , we believe that this is not fully responsible for the reduction of the coupling strength by one order of magnitude since the spr linewidth and , therefore , the plasmon lifetime found in fig .",
    "[ spr](a ) is similar for both substrates .        to gain deeper insight into the interaction behavior of the individual triangles , we varied the polarization axis of the incident white light and explored the impact on the energetic position of the spr .",
    "all measurements presented above were obtained with the polarization aligned along the long bowtie axis ( @xmath3=0@xmath5 ) , which means that the induced charge oscillation pushes the electrons towards the tips at the feed gap ( see inset ( i ) , fig .",
    "[ pol](c ) ) .",
    "if the gap is much smaller than the wavelength of the driving field , a significant fraction of the plasmon near - field can reach the adjacent triangle and lower the restoring force of the free electron plasma , resulting in a redshift of the spr@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the electrons are pushed into the non - facing tips of the bowtie if the polarization is rotated by 90@xmath5 ( see inset ( ii ) , fig .",
    "[ pol](c ) ) . due to their relatively large separation",
    ", the near - fields can not interact strongly and the spr frequency is close to that of a single uncoupled triangle ( @xmath22 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ pol](a ) and ( b ) , we present polarization resolved differential reflectivity spectra for gaas ( s=170 nm , g = 5 nm ) and glass ( s=170 nm , g = 20 nm ) samples , respectively .",
    "the shift from the coupled to the uncoupled mode is clearly visible for both substrates .",
    "furthermore , we observe a broadening of the spr s fwhm by @xmath150@xmath010mev for the coupled case , which we attribute to increased radiation damping .",
    "this effect only depends on the volume of the probed structure@xcite , which is twice as large for the coupled mode than for the uncoupled one . in fig .",
    "[ pol](c ) , the spr peak energy is plotted as a function of the polarization angle @xmath3 of the incident light for bowties on gaas with s=170 nm and g ranging from 5 nm to 80 nm . when the polarization is tuned perpendicular to the bowtie axis ( @xmath3=90@xmath5 and @xmath3=270@xmath5 ) ,",
    "we observe values of 1.10@xmath00.01ev , close to the resonance energy of uncoupled , nominal identical triangles .",
    "the grey dashed line indicates the position of the spr peak energy for a single triangle , obtained from our fdtd simulations .",
    "furthermore , the inset ( ii ) shows the corresponding electric field distribution where we observe the two independent modes of the individual triangles . in contrast ,",
    "when we turn the polarization parallel to the long bowtie axis ( @xmath3=0@xmath5 and @xmath3=180@xmath5 ) , we probe the coupled mode ( inset ( i ) ) and obtain a red shift , the size of which peaks at @xmath23=0.14@xmath00.01ev for g=5 nm . this continuous change in peak energy",
    "can be well described by @xmath24 ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ pol](c ) and ( d ) ) whose amplitude @xmath23 increases with decreasing gap and increasing coupling , respectively .",
    "the same behavior is found for nominally identical bowties on a glass substrate , shown in fig .",
    "[ pol](d ) .",
    "however , we detect a redshift of @xmath23=0.20@xmath00.01ev already at g=20 nm supporting our expectation of enhanced interaction between the individual bowtie triangles on glass as compared to gaas . to quantify this behavior , we plotted the obtained @xmath23 as a function of g as shown in fig .",
    "[ pol](e ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , on the glass substrate there is already a significant coupling effect for g=50 nm , whereas on gaas the triangles show a relevant interaction only for g@xmath1020 nm .",
    "the two curves follow again a g^-3 ^ -trend , indicating that the coupling can be visualized as a dipole - dipole interaction@xcite . in this simplified picture",
    "we treat the triangles as two point dipoles which are separated by g plus an additional offset @xmath25 that depends on the charge distribution inside the triangles .",
    "the resulting fit formula reads then : @xmath26    where c determines the curvature and , therefore , the coupling strength which strongly depends on the used geometry and substrate . from the fit of the measurement data",
    ", we obtained a value for @xmath27=30@xmath09 nm and @xmath28=24@xmath02 nm , identical within the experimental error .",
    "for c we obtained @xmath29=12.5@xmath06.6@xmath30 and @xmath31=1.5@xmath00.3@xmath30 indicating that the coupling between the triangles on glass substrates is @xmath18@xmath2 stronger than on gaas for comparable geometric parameters . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ pol](e ) we plotted the same data as a function of the effective separation between the two dipoles @xmath32=@xmath33+@xmath34 on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "for the offset we used @xmath34=24.5 nm , the weighted mean value obtained from our fits . as a guide to the eye , we also plotted a dashed line having a slope of -3 , indicating that we indeed observe a g^-3 ^ -trend in our measurements .",
    "the origin of the pronounced difference between the two material systems becomes clear upon looking at simulations of the electric field intensity around the bowtie ( s=150 nm , g=50 nm ) at the spr frequency as shown in fig .",
    "[ pol](f ) and ( g ) on a logarithmic scale for gaas and glass , respectively . in the case of glass ,",
    "most of the electromagnetic energy is located in and around the feed gap of the antenna . moreover ,",
    "if g<80 nm the fields of the individual triangles penetrate into the neighboring nanotriangle and interact with the free electron plasma .",
    "in contrast , the electric field intensity in the gaas samples is more strongly localized directly at the gold surface in the feed gap and especially in the oxide layer between the gold and the gaas .",
    "this leads to a decrease in the coupling strength between the two triangles compared to the identical structures on glass .",
    "the inset of both figures show a cross section along the dashed line at y=0 nm on a linear scale .",
    "we found that the field exactly in the middle of the feed gap is 14@xmath2 enhanced on gaas compared to 79@xmath2 for nominally identical triangles on glass .",
    "also the exponential decay of the electric field intensity within the feed gap is faster on gaas ( 5.2@xmath00.3 nm ) than on glass ( 7.8@xmath00.2 nm ) . from those findings we conclude that the lower coupling in the gaas samples can be explained by a lower overlap of the electric fields between the two triangles .",
    "it is remarkable that the calculated field enhancement in the gaas samples is largest at the gold / oxide interface where enhancement factors up to 570@xmath2 were found as compared to 90@xmath2 at the gold / air interface . in future experiments",
    ", this strong field enhancement could be used in optically active plasmonic - semiconducting systems , where bowtie antennas are coupled to proximal active emitters such as ingaas quantum dots in order to tailor their emissive properties@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we point out that by addressing single bowties , further decreasing the gap size , and using monocrystalline gold@xcite it should be possible , especially on a glass substrate , to reach a regime where the splitting between the coupled and uncoupled mode of a bowtie is bigger than their linewidth .",
    "this tunable and significant coupling between the two orthogonally polarized plasmonic modes may open the way toward thz spectroscopy and parametric coherent driving of isolated nano objects placed into the feed gap@xcite .",
    "moreover , the use of a semiconductor substrate as demonstrated in this study may even facilitate such experiments on individual quantum emitters that have already demonstrated excellent coherence properties .",
    "it could , therefore , be possible to link the thz and optical regimes coherently at the quantum limit .",
    "in summary , we presented a comprehensive study of the optical properties of gold bowtie nanoantennas defined by electron beam lithography on gaas substrates . using fdtd simulations , we determined the optimum au thickness of our structures to be @xmath135 nm representing a tradeoff between good scattering properties and structures having small feed gaps and sharp tip radii .",
    "we fabricated bowtie nanoantennas with sizes s=100 - 190 nm , feed gaps g=5 - 80 nm and tip radii of the order of 10 nm on gaas and glass .",
    "the spr peak energy for bowtie antennas on gaas samples was found to red shift linearly with increasing size at a rate of 7.0@xmath00.5mev / nm and can , therefore , be tuned through the emission range of self - assembled ingaas quantum dots around 1.3ev .",
    "we found a uniform global redshift of the spr of 0.25@xmath00.05ev on gaas compared to the samples on glass .",
    "gap dependent measurements showed a clear difference in the coupling strength , as we observed a redshift of 0.03ev on gaas when decreasing the feed gap from 80 nm to 10 nm compared to 0.20ev for the glass sample . using polarization",
    "resolved measurements , we quantified the coupling strength to be @xmath18 times lower on gaas as compared to glass . from our simulations , which support our obtained results ,",
    "we conclude that this effect is caused by a modification of the electric field distribution due to the difference of the substrate s refractive indices and the presence of a 4 nm thin native oxide layer on top of the gaas wafer .",
    "the obtained results provide important information for the integration of plasmonic nanoantennas in novel , photonic , on - chip devices and the design of future plasmonic hybrid systems .",

    "<S> the results obtained are of strong relevance for the integration of lithographically defined plasmonic nanoantennas on semiconducting substrates and , therefore , for the development of novel optically active plasmonic - semiconducting nanostructures . </S>"
