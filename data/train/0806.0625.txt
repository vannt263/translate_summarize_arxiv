    "the stellar mass in the local universe lies largely within two distinct classes of galaxies : actively star  forming spirals , and massive ellipticals with evolved stellar populations and little current star formation .",
    "these populations show strongly bimodal behavior in a number of measured and derived quantities , including color @xcite , the 4000  break strength @xmath10 ( an indicator of stellar population age ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and clustering strength @xcite .",
    "relatively low  mass galaxies with high star ",
    "formation rates have also been found at high redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath11 lyman  break galaxies or lbgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "surprisingly , the population of massive , `` dead '' galaxies appears to persist to high redshift as well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even though the universe was only a few gyr old at that point .",
    "since the stellar populations of evolved galaxies often have ages that are a significant fraction of the age of the universe at these redshifts , the implication is that they must have formed ( and their star formation ceased ) far earlier than anticipated by standard hierarchical structure formation models .",
    "investigating the evolution of star formation activity and the assembly of stellar mass over the past @xmath12gyr are therefore two key avenues to understanding how the present galaxy population came to be , and large samples of galaxies during this peak formation epoch ( @xmath0 ) are needed for this . as spectroscopy of faint objects is extremely expensive with regard to telescope time , several highly efficient broadband selection techniques have been designed to weed out low  redshift interlopers .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned lbg selection , which primarily finds unobscured star  forming galaxies at @xmath11 , the distant red galaxy ( drg ) criterion ( @xmath13 ( vega ) or @xmath14 ( ab ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instead tends to find the most _ massive _ galaxies at @xmath15 @xcite , about half of which show signs of heavily  obscured star formation @xcite .",
    "other methods , such as the @xmath16 selection of @xcite , are adept at selecting @xmath0 galaxies over a wide range of masses and star  formation rates .",
    "each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages , but one point has become clear : to effectively study the mass evolution of high  redshift galaxies , deep near  infrared data are crucial .",
    "the observed @xmath17 bands trace rest  frame optical light at @xmath18 and provide a more reliable indicator of stellar mass than the rest  frame uv ( observed optical ) ; indeed , drgs themselves appear to represent an important fraction , if not the majority , of stellar mass at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "such galaxies are typically faint in the observed optical bands , either from old stellar populations or dust obscuration , and are often missed by purely optical selection techniques @xcite .",
    "selecting galaxies from deep near  infrared fields is therefore likely to yield a more complete picture of the stellar mass at high redshift than similar studies at optical wavelengths .    until recently , the small sizes ( at most a few square arcminutes ) and relatively low efficiencies of the available infrared detectors made large , deep near  ir surveys impractical .",
    "such projects therefore typically followed the `` pencil  beam '' approach , surveying a single frame to high sensitivity ( e.g. , the _ faint infrared extragalactic survey , fires _ ; * ? ? ? * ) , or alternatively observing somewhat larger areas at the expense of depth ( e.g. , goods ",

    "in this analysis we employ the reduced @xmath24 and @xmath1band uds mosaics provided as a subset of the ukidss data release 1 ( dr1 ; * ? ? ? * ) ; @xmath25band data were not available in this release .",
    "the ukidss project , defined in @xcite , uses the ukirt wide field camera ( wfcam * ? ? ? * ) and a photometric system described in @xcite ; the pipeline processing and science archive are described in irwin et al .",
    "( in preparation ) and @xcite respectively .",
    "the uds field consists of a single repeatedly  observed ukidss survey tile ( in turn comprising four subsequent wfcam observations arranged in a square to produce uniform coverage ) , with a total area of @xmath26  deg@xmath27 and reaching nominal depths of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( ab ; @xmath30 point  source threshold in a 2  aperture ) .",
    "the 04 pixel scale of wfcam does not sufficiently sample the @xmath31band psf of @xmath32 , so the individual observations are offset by fractions of a pixel and the combined mosaics regridded by a factor of 3 to a pixel scale of 0134 .",
    "note that while data release 2 has since been made available @xcite , this release contains identical uds mosaics to dr1 ; only data in the shallower ukidss surveys were updated .",
    "optical imaging of most of the uds field is provided by the subaru ",
    "xmm deep survey ( sxds ) beta release , a deep wide  field survey employing the subaru telescope and subaru prime focus camera ( suprime  cam or sup ; * ? ? ?",
    "this imager contains ten @xmath33 pixel ccds arranged in a @xmath34 mosaic , providing a rectangular field  of  view of roughly @xmath35 .",

    "the swire survey covers a total of @xmath44deg@xmath27 with irac and mips in six subfields , one of which ( the xmm  lss field ) includes nearly the entire uds / sxds area .",
    "the orientations of the irac / mips fields are at an angle to the uds ; therefore , only a small triangular region in the southwest corner of the uds has no swire coverage ( shown in figure  [ fig_fields ] ) .",
    "swire reaches nominal @xmath30 point  source depths of 3.7 , 5.4 , 48 , and 37.8 @xmath8jy in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath8 m irac bands respectively , and 230@xmath8jy in mips",
    "24@xmath8 m .",
    "the irac mosaics of this field are divided into 16 separate subimages , with four of these having some overlap with the uds field ; the mips 24@xmath8 m image of the field is available as a single file .",
    "the relevant subimages of all four irac bands , as well as the full 24@xmath8 m mips image , were obtained from the public swire data website . due to their far broader point  response functions and lower sensitivities , we do not analyze the mips 70@xmath8 m or 160@xmath8 m data here ; similarly , the @xmath45 m and @xmath46 m data are excluded due to their order  of  magnitude lower sensitivity compared to the first two irac bands .",
    "furthermore , since most objects seen in the uds @xmath1band are not individually detected in the swire @xmath47 m image , the @xmath47 m data are therefore not included in our final @xmath1selected catalog ( but a stacking analysis of these data are discussed in  [ sec_mips ] ) .",
    "a summary of the data employed in the production of our @xmath1selected catalog , including areas and measured limiting depths ( as discussed in  [ sec_complete ] ) is given in table  [ tab_limits ] .",
    "the simplest way to achieve consistent flux measurements across multiple bands with arbitrary psfs is to transform the images such that they are all on the same coordinate system and pixel scale .",
    "the pixel scale of the uds images is 0134 ; however , all of these images have psf fwhms larger than 07 ( the uds @xmath1band seeing ) . to reduce file sizes and processing time ,",
    "we thus adopt a standard pixel scale of 0202 , the native scale of the sxds images .",
    "this is somewhat coarser than the original regridded uds pixel scale , but still sufficiently samples all psfs .",
    "the swarp software package @xcite was used to crop , resample , and transform these sets of images to a common coordinate system before combining the subimages ( in the cases of the irac and sxds data ) into single mosaics .",
    "since the uds @xmath1 image has the best seeing and is the band from which objects are detected , this was taken as the `` standard '' field to which all other images were registered .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath1 data were resampled to the sxds pixel scale and cropped to remove noisy and missing data regions near the edges , resulting in 524 by 530 images .",
    "likewise , the swire mips 24@xmath8 m image and the irac subimages that cover the uds field were transformed , resampled , and cropped to cover the same area . however , since the five sxds pointings taken with each filter can exhibit different seeing and geometric distortions , those images were psf  matched ( see  [ sec_psf ] ) and astrometrically corrected prior to combining with swarp .    as swarp transformed the images based solely on the astrometric information in the image",
    "fits headers , some distortions are likely to remain ( particularly between data from differing instruments ) .",
    "the measured positions of stars were thus used to correct these distortions .",
    "source extractor version 2.5.0 ( sextractor ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was first used to find the positions of bright objects in the @xmath1 image and measure their approximate @xmath24 and @xmath1 fluxes .",
    "@xmath48 stars were selected on the basis of their blue ir colors ( @xmath49 ) and bright but unsaturated @xmath1band fluxes ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the radial profiles of these objects were fitted with gaussians to determine their centers and psf widths in the @xmath1 band ; all but a negligible fraction ( @xmath51%)had fwhms comparable to the nominal image resolution , indicating that this simple color cut indeed primarily selects point sources .",
    "next , a centroid algorithm was employed to determine the positions of these stars in each of the @xmath52 images .",
    "finally , the pixel positions of these stars along with the iraf tasks geomap and geotran were used to transform the sxds , uds @xmath24 , and irac images to the same coordinate system as the uds @xmath1 mosaic . to check the agreement between the images , the pixel coordinates of these stars",
    "were again measured in the transformed images and found to agree well , e.g.  in the @xmath53 mosaic the image coordinates agree with those in the @xmath1 image to within 0.5 pixel ( 01 ) in 75% of cases , with a median absolute deviation of 006 .",
    "similar offsets are seen in the transformed irac @xmath54 and @xmath55 m images ( in addition , automatic astrometric corrections are performed in the irac deblending described in ",
    "[ sec_iracphot ] ) .",
    "such astrometric deviations typically translate to systematic flux errors of at most @xmath56% .",
    "the observed seeing width varies significantly between the different bands : point sources in the uds have fwhms of approximately 07 in @xmath1 and 08 in @xmath24 , while in sxds they range between @xmath57 depending on the field and band .",
    "additional higher  order variations are likely to be present in the psfs due to differences in the two instruments optics . directly performing aperture photometry on these images",
    "would lead to flux offsets in the different bands ( with less flux falling inside the aperture for the poorer  seeing images ) , and thus systematic color errors .    to mitigate this ,",
    "all images were smoothed to the same psf before fluxes were measured . although this can be accomplished by convolving each with a simple gaussian or higher  order kernel , the multitude of stars within these images",
    "can themselves be used to generate empirical kernels that contain all structural information about the psfs .",
    "this is accomplished by deconvolving a low  resolution ( `` reference '' ) psf with one constructed from a higher  resolution ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the low  resolution and high  resolution psfs respectively .",
    "the resulting kernel can then be convolved with the high  resolution image in its entirety to bring it to the same psf as the reference image .",
    "@xmath60 since the deconvolution step strongly magnifies any intrinsic noise in the psfs , a large number of bright ( but unsaturated ) stars are necessary in each band to produce psfs with sufficiently low noise levels .",
    "for the @xmath24 and @xmath1 images , the psfs were constructed from the same stars that were selected for astrometric matching , keeping the 200 brightest in each band . however , many of these stars are saturated in the sxds images due to the much longer exposure times employed in this survey . as the effects of saturation are far more detrimental for the psf shape than in the astrometric correction , a different method for selecting stars in the sxds images is necessary .",
    "for these images , the iraf psfmeasure task was used to estimate widths of unsaturated objects in the image based on a gaussian fit . in a histogram of the widths of these objects",
    ", there is an obvious cutoff on the low  fwhm end accompanied by a sharp peak and an overlying broad distribution extending to larger fwhms .",
    "objects in the narrow peak were presumed to be point sources to within the image resolution , and the brightest of these were selected as stars in each optical image .",
    "square postage stamps ( 21 pixels or 42 on a side ) of the stars selected in each image were then created , and these in turn were median  combined to create 22 empirical psfs ( one for each of the 20 sxds subimages , plus one for each uds mosaic ) . enclosed flux as a function of aperture size ( growth curves )",
    "were then created for these psfs . the `` slowest  growing '' growth curve , indicating the broadest psf , is that of the western sxds @xmath61band image with a fwhm of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we take this as the reference psf and match the other 19 sxds fields and two uds images to it .",
    "the average growth curves for point sources in the smoothed @xmath63 images , expressed as a fraction of the sxds ",
    "west @xmath64 ( reference ) growth curve , before and after smoothing , are shown in figure  [ fig_gc ] . at the aperture sizes used for flux measurements in the following section ( @xmath65 or @xmath66 pixels in diameter ) , the psfs",
    "are matched to within 2% .",
    "the point ",
    "response functions of the irac 3.6@xmath8 m and 4.5@xmath8 m images are roughly @xmath67 as broad as in the worst sxds image ( @xmath68 for both ) ; they also contain significant non - gaussian structure resulting from point source diffraction .",
    "while it would have been simpler in principle to smooth the @xmath63 images to the irac psf shape , this would substantially reduce the detection efficiency in @xmath1 while ( for most high  redshift sources ) providing only weak detections in irac to begin with .",
    "additionally , blending from nearby sources is more likely to adversely affect simple aperture photometry in the irac images .",
    "psf  matching and photometry are thus performed on these data using a different technique , described in  [ sec_iracphot ] .",
    "to measure fluxes of sources in the @xmath63 images we used sextractor in dual ",
    "image mode , whereby one image is used to detect sources and aperture photometry is performed on another image registered to the identical coordinate system . the unsmoothed ( pre  psf matching )",
    "@xmath1 mosaic was used as the detection image , and fluxes were measured in each of the six psf  matched ir / optical mosaics .",
    "the sensitivity across the @xmath1 image is not perfectly uniform due to overlapping exposures and array efficiency variations ; such nonuniformity can lead to corresponding variations in the number of detected galaxies , and thus to spurious clustering signals .",
    "we used the ukidss  supplied confidence map to construct an rms map of the @xmath1 image , and this map was applied as the weight image within sextractor in order to detect sources in an effectively noise  equalized and uniform manner .",
    "several initial sextractor runs were performed with varying detection parameters and the results checked by eye ; the final choice of parameters appeared to find all faint objects with few spurious detections ( see  [ sec_complete ] ) .",
    "total fluxes were determined using a flexible elliptical aperture ( sextractor s auto aperture ; * ? ? ? * ) . to ensure that color measurements are consistent , fluxes in a fixed circular aperture",
    "were also measured .",
    "the optimal size of this `` color '' aperture is subject to two primary considerations : while a larger aperture encloses a greater fraction of a given object s flux , it also suffers from higher uncertainty due to background fluctuations . to determine the best aperture size",
    ", we divided the growth curve of each image by its noise function ( i.e. , photometric uncertainty versus aperture size , described in detail in  [ sec_photerr ] ) .",
    "this is effectively equivalent to the signal  to  noise ( sn ) of each image as a function of aperture size , and is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig_gcsn ] .",
    "the @xmath1band sn peaks at a diameter of @xmath69 pixels or 08 , which is lower than the ideal aperture size theoretically expected with uncorrelated noise ( @xmath70 ) , but consistent with the @xmath71fwhm optimal aperture found for the musyc data @xcite .",
    "the growth curves shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig_gcsn ] indicate that an aperture of this size misses about 70% of a point source s flux .",
    "such a small aperture is highly susceptible to systematic errors from imperfect psf matching and astrometric offsets .",
    "additionally , larger apertures appear to produce slightly bluer @xmath72 colors ( on the order of 0.05 magnitudes between 1  and 2  apertures ) , perhaps due to intrinsic galaxy color gradients and/or imperfect image matching . to ensure more accurate colors of non  point sources , as a compromise we adopt a somewhat larger `` color '' aperture of 175 diameter .",
    "this more than doubles the enclosed flux while only decreasing the sn by @xmath73% from the optimal value .    in cases where the auto aperture is smaller than 175 ( primarily occurring for faint , point  like sources ) , the color aperture flux is substituted for the total flux .",
    "all total fluxes are corrected for flux falling outside the aperture assuming a minimal ( point  like ) source flux distribution .",
    "the sextractor photometry was verified by comparing the @xmath64 total flux values with those of objects in spatially coincident hst / acs images .",
    "the only useful acs data in the archive were taken with the f850lp filter , which is approximately equivalent to sxds @xmath64 ; fluxes of objects in these acs data were consistent with those derived from sxds .",
    "the photometric zeropoints of the sxds @xmath64 data thus appear to be properly calibrated .",
    "since the same calibration techniques and standard star fields were used by the sxds team to determine the @xmath74 image zeropoints , we assume the calibrations in these bands are accurate as well ( though the lack of available verification data should be kept in mind ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_kdist ] shows the distribution of @xmath1 magnitudes for all objects detected by sextractor , with number counts overplotted from two other @xmath1selected samples : fires ms1054 - 03 @xcite and cdfs - goods @xcite .",
    "the number counts of the three surveys are similar to the uds limiting magnitude , though the enhanced number of faint objects in the fires field ( due to the presence of the @xmath75 cluster ms @xmath76 ) is evident .",
    "as previously mentioned , the optical and nir images were smoothed to the seeing of the sxds ",
    "west @xmath64band data rather than the much broader point ",
    "response function of the irac data .",
    "the direct aperture photometry from sextractor would therefore not measure irac fluxes that are properly matched to the other bands .",
    "moreover , the lower  resolution irac images are more prone to blending than the other bands , which can introduce significant systematic errors in the measured colors .",
    "we thus employed the method of @xcite to correct this , summarized below .",
    "sources that are bright in @xmath1 are also typically bright in the 3.6/4.5@xmath8 m bands ; thus , the @xmath1 image is used as a high  resolution template to deblend the irac images .",
    "convolution kernels used to transform from the @xmath1 to the irac psfs are constructed from bright and unsaturated sources ( computed by fitting a series of gaussian  weighted hermite functions to the fourier transforms of the objects in irac and @xmath1 ) , and a smoothed map of the kernel coefficients as a function of image position is then produced .",
    "for a given object detected in @xmath1 , neighboring sources are fitted and subtracted out using the local convolution kernel ( derived from the aforementioned smoothed coefficient map ) and the sextractor  derived segmentation map .",
    "this results in a `` cleaned '' irac subimage containing only the source in question ; standard photometry with a 3  diameter aperture is then performed on the source , and this process is repeated for each object in the @xmath1selected catalog . through a visual inspection of the irac residual image with all sources subtracted , we conclude that this method effectively removes contaminating sources ( for an illustration of this technique , see also figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since the irac photometry from this procedure is performed using a larger aperture on images with significantly broader psfs than the matched @xmath63 images , these fluxes must be corrected in order to obtain accurate irac ",
    "ir / optical colors .",
    "this is accomplished by multiplying the irac flux measured in a 3   aperture by a correction factor to obtain a `` matched '' irac flux : @xmath77 where @xmath78(3 ) is the flux of the object measured in the @xmath1band image after smoothing it to the irac resolution , and @xmath79 is the k  band flux measured in the fixed `` color '' aperture ( see  [ sec_sextractor ] ) .",
    "this correction implicitly assumes that the ratio of fluxes between the two aperture sizes is the same for @xmath1 and irac , i.e. color gradients between 175 and 3  are insignificant .",
    "while this technique could introduce systematic errors in measurements of extended sources with strong color gradients , at the redshifts primarily considered here ( @xmath80 ) most galaxies have small angular sizes and are not likely to be adversely affected .",
    "all three sets of images ( uds , sxds , swire ) contained regions where either no data were available or the derived photometry was unreliable .",
    "thus , even though sextractor finds objects in these regions , their fluxes should be considered unreliable . to account for this we created bad ",
    "pixel maps for each image set ; if an object s `` color '' aperture contains any such bad pixels , we set a flag indicating as such in the catalog .",
    "the bad pixel maps created for each survey are mostly a result of the following effects :    1 .",
    "uds @xmath81:_false sources and large negative residuals . _ in rows and columns containing bright stars , there are often significant positive and negative images ( repeated at regular intervals ) as a result of crosstalk between wfcam detector nodes . these `` false positive '' images , while obviously not true astrophysical sources upon visual inspection , are nonetheless picked up as real objects by sextractor . to make matters worse ,",
    "many such `` false positives '' in @xmath1 have negative apparent flux in @xmath24 , causing these to appear as very red objects",
    ". they can thus mimic high ",
    "redshift near  ir galaxy colors and may be an important contaminant in our catalog .",
    "fortunately , adjacent to most of the false positive images in @xmath1 , some strongly negative residuals are also typically seen .",
    "we thus searched for such strong @xmath1 residuals in the image , removing any object falling on or within 10 pixels of any such artifact as bad .",
    "as a secondary check , we searched for objects which were detected in @xmath1 but undetected in the sum of the @xmath82 mosaics .",
    "this cut finds an additional @xmath83 possible bad spots .",
    "a visual inspection confirms that about @xmath84% of these are indeed artifacts ( including diffraction spikes from bright stars and meteor streaks in @xmath1 ) that were undetected by the aforementioned `` negative residual '' technique , and most of the remaining @xmath85% are extremely faint and likely to be spurious detections .",
    "however , since some of these optically  nondetected objects are real , they have been included in the catalog with a flag indicating that they are likely to be bad .",
    "sxds @xmath86 : _ non  covered regions and bright stars .",
    "_ as shown in figure  [ fig_fields ] , the corners of the @xmath87 fields are not covered by the sxds imaging . additionally , bright stars in sxds are surrounded by concentric halos and extended readout streaks .",
    "the subaru team has provided files which define the regions affected by these bright stars ; a visual inspection of the sxds frames confirms that these regions accurately describe the affected areas . for each of the five pointings we created a map such that pixels falling within these regions had a value of 1 , and zero otherwise . using swarp ,",
    "these bad pixel masks were then transformed and combined into a single mosaic on the same coordinate system as the other images ( assigning a value of 1 to the corners with no sxds coverage as well ) .",
    "swire : _ one non  covered region .",
    "_ the swire survey spans an area many times larger than the uds field , with nearly uniform coverage over the uds / sxds area except for a small triangular region in the southwest corner of the field . as most of this triangle is also outside the sxds coverage area , reliable irac flux measurements ( or upper limits )",
    "are available for essentially all objects with sxds photometry",
    ". objects with coordinates falling in this missing swire piece are flagged in the catalog .",
    "it should be noted that , while these techniques were effective at automatically finding many false detections and areas of unreliable photometry , some undetected artifacts are likely to remain in the full catalog . for the analysis described herein we therefore visually inspected subsets of our samples to ensure that such artifacts do not significantly affect our results .",
    "the uncertainty of a flux determined through aperture photometry contains contributions from the intrinsic poisson error in the source counts and from background noise . while the first ( automatically calculated by sextractor ) is straightforward to determine and is the dominant source of uncertainty for bright objects , the background uncertainty is important for fainter sources .",
    "for perfectly random ( uncorrelated ) background noise the additional photometric uncertainty is simply @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the number of pixels contained within the aperture and @xmath90 is the pixel  to  pixel rms . on the other extreme , if the noise is perfectly correlated , then @xmath91 .",
    "typical images will fall somewhere between these two cases , exhibiting a general form of @xmath92 .",
    "we estimated the background uncertainty following the method of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , to estimate this power  law index , several hundred apertures of a given size were randomly placed on empty parts of the images ( i.e. , those containing no emission detected by sextractor ) .",
    "the rms variation @xmath93 was found by fitting a gaussian to the resulting histogram of aperture fluxes , and this process was repeated for aperture diameters from 2 to 40 pixels ( 048 ) .",
    "we then fit a general power ",
    "law function to the @xmath93 vs.  @xmath94 curve to determine the average value of @xmath95 over each image ; these @xmath95 parameters were near 1.5 for all images ( ranging from @xmath96 for @xmath24 to @xmath97 for @xmath98 ) .",
    "ideally , the power  law normalization should simply be equal to the local pixel  to  pixel rms @xmath90 .",

    "the photometric redshifts appear to exhibit a small systematic offset of @xmath122 ( though due to the small number of points here it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the offset ) .",
    "a similar offset at the same redshift is seen by @xcite even with more photometric bands included ( notably @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath25 ) , and the offset persists when different template sets and input parameters are used .",
    "additionally , relatively small  scale `` spikes '' and `` voids '' ( on the scale of @xmath125 ) in the photometric redshift distribution are apparent  see figure  [ fig_zdist ] .",
    "these may in part represent real variations in the large  scale galaxy distribution , but some are also likely to be numerical artifacts intrinsic to the photometric redshifts .",
    "however , since these effects are relatively small , and since in our analysis we employ redshift intervals ( @xmath126 ) larger than the observed `` spikes '' in the @xmath2 distribution , such effects are not likely to significantly affect our results .",
    "the rest  frame near and mid  infrared properties of typical galaxies are not as well constrained as the optical seds , so the galaxy templates employed by eazy tend to be uncertain in this regime .",

    "including irac data in the calculation of photometric redshifts thus reduces the @xmath2 scatter and allows outlying points ( including many agns ) to be rejected from the sample .",

    "since the galaxy templates employed by eazy do not take possible agn components into account , the 4.5@xmath8 m excess in galaxies with nuclear activity in turn can not be matched well by any of these templates .",

    "fit @xmath2 values ( e.g. , in an extreme case with a sample of @xmath131 galaxies , the true distribution would be much broader than a delta function ) . to assess the consistency of the @xmath130 distributions",
    ", we performed 120 monte carlo iterations varying the input photometry assuming gaussian errors .",
    "though this is a relatively small number of iterations , it gives a rough estimate of the @xmath2 uncertainty for any given object , and an accurate computation of the redshift distribution of a large sample of objects .",
    "for each object , the median and dispersion among the 120 monte carlo runs were determined and compared to the estimates from eazy .",

    "a striking bimodality emerges : one diagonal track extends from blue to red @xmath6 , while a localized clump that is red in @xmath5 but blue in @xmath6 lies above this track .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite found that actively star  forming and quiescent galaxies segregate themselves in this plane , with the star  forming galaxies forming a diagonal track and quiescent galaxies populating mostly the upper left ",
    "hand region ; with the far larger number of sources in the uds , it is now evident that the galaxies form a truly bimodal distribution in this plane .",
    "indeed , this interpretation is supported here by both data and models : the red points overlying the `` quiescent clump '' in figure  [ fig_rfcol ] are spectroscopically  confirmed old passively  evolving galaxies from @xcite , while the star  forming and quiescent loci are reasonably coincident with the corresponding @xcite stellar population models ; a detailed analysis of the star ",
    "formation properties of galaxies in the @xmath134 plane will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( labb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    essentially , the @xmath134 diagram allows the degeneracy between red star  forming and red quiescent galaxies to be broken : while galaxies with blue @xmath5 colors in general exhibit relatively unobscured star formation activity , red galaxies could be either quiescent galaxies with evolved stellar populations or dust  obscured starbursts .",
    "but since dust  free quiescent galaxies are _ blue _ in @xmath6 , they occupy a locus in the @xmath134 plane that is distinct from the star  forming galaxies , allowing the two populations to be empirically separated .",
    "clearly , such a separation using a single color ( such as @xmath5 ) would be fraught with problems : at best , the quiescent sample derived in this manner would be contaminated by red starbursts , and if the number of such starbursts were sufficiently high the bimodality would no longer be visible ( see also figure  [ fig_dahist ] ) . note that although the @xmath143 color is better at distinguishing between a narrow break ( characteristic of an old stellar population ) and broader dust reddening when spectroscopic redshifts are available , the larger uncertainties on photometric redshifts do not allow sufficiently accurate @xmath143 colors to be estimated .    even when photometric redshifts are derived using alternative template sets within eazy , or an entirely different @xmath2 code ( hyperz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the basic bimodal shape of figure  [ fig_rfcol ] persists , indicating that this method is robust to the specific numerical technique employed .",
    "changes in rest  frame colors with redshift reflect the intrinsic evolution of stellar populations , since all spectra have in principle been transformed to the same reference frame ( barring possible @xmath2 systematic errors ) . @xmath134",
    "diagrams at five different redshifts ( in bins of width @xmath144 ) are shown in figure  [ fig_evol ] .",
    "the most immediately apparent feature is that the observed bimodal distribution of star  forming and quiescent galaxies is clearly seen up to @xmath0 .",
    "although the scatter increases substantially at higher redshifts ( to the point where it likely washes out any intrinsic bimodality at @xmath7 ) , most likely due to a combination of larger photometric redshift uncertainties and weaker observed fluxes , the two distinct populations are nonetheless visible .",
    "it is also notable that the shape of the star ",
    "forming sequence appears to change : at the lowest redshifts the sequence curves , but this may be due to the effects of using a small aperture on relatively nearby galaxies ( i.e. , the outermost , bluer parts of galaxies with large angular sizes falling outside the `` color '' aperture ) . at @xmath145 , where the angular size ",
    "redshift relation begins to flatten , the dust sequence indeed becomes more linear .",
    "the increase in star formation activity at higher redshifts is also apparent in two ways : the fractional number of dusty , star  forming galaxies ( the upper ",
    "right portion of the dust sequence ) increases , and the entire dust sequence appears to move to redder @xmath6 colors . note that at @xmath146 a concentration at red @xmath6 and @xmath5 appears ; this mainly comprises galaxies with a substantial contribution from the red @xmath147 template included with eazy .",
    "this single template substantially improves the @xmath2 solutions of very dusty galaxies , but can lead to the observed discrete clump in color  color space .    with increasing redshift the dead clump appears to steadily move to bluer @xmath5 ( with the median @xmath5 changing by @xmath148 magnitudes between the @xmath149 and @xmath150 bins ) , while the @xmath6 color remains more or less unchanged .",
    "this is expected from passive evolution of the stellar populations in the clump , but relatively small systematic errors in the photometric redshifts ( on the order of @xmath151 ) can produce similar offsets in the average @xmath5 color of quiescent galaxies at @xmath152 .",
    "the @xmath2 estimates show a systematic offset that is smaller than this , about @xmath153 over the full redshift range ( see figure  [ fig_zcompare ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , given the lack of spectroscopic redshifts at @xmath154 , we can not ascertain whether there are larger systematic offsets at higher redshift , and therefore can not accurately measure the color evolution of galaxies in the quiescent clump or absolutely define the boundaries of the box in which they live .      since the color bimodality is visible up to @xmath0 , we employ empirical criteria to divide this sample into quiescent and star  forming subsamples . in each redshift bin of figure  [ fig_evol ] where the bimodality could be seen",
    ", an initial diagonal cut was first made between the two populations .",
    "histograms of red galaxy counts relative to this line were then derived .",
    "the position of the diagonal cut was fine  tuned ( keeping the same slope at all redshifts ) to fall roughly between the two peaks ( except in the lowest ",
    "redshift bin , where the shapes of the quiescent and star  forming galaxy loci made this impossible ) ; figure  [ fig_dahist ] ( left panel ) shows these histograms along the adjusted diagonal lines .",
    "the adopted diagonal selection criteria for quiescent galaxies between @xmath155 bin are : @xmath156\\\\ ( u - v)>0.88\\times(v - j)+0.59 & & & & \\left[0.5<z<1.0\\right]\\\\ ( u - v)>0.88\\times(v - j)+0.49 & & & & \\left[1.0<z<2.0\\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] additional criteria of @xmath157 and @xmath158 are applied to the quiescent galaxies at all redshifts to prevent contamination from unobscured and dusty star  forming galaxies , respectively .",
    "the samples of star  forming galaxies are then defined by everything falling outside this box ( but within the color range plotted in figure  [ fig_evol ] , such that the very small number of extreme color outliers are not included in either sample ) .",

    "note that the exact placement of this division does not significantly affect the results presented herein ( see also  7 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "typical random color uncertainties for the star  forming and quiescent samples at each redshift interval are shown in the lower right and upper left corners , respectively , of each panel in figure  [ fig_evol ] .      between @xmath160 , the @xmath47 m flux of galaxies",
    "is strongly correlated with dust  obscured star formation due to the presence of redshifted @xmath161 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features in this band ( * ? ? ?",
    "the observed @xmath47 m fluxes of the uds galaxies can thus be used to empirically confirm whether the @xmath134 criteria indeed select star  forming and quiescent galaxies . since the @xmath1 band , which at these redshifts corresponds to rest ",

    "formation rate ( ssfr ) .",
    "likewise , the uv ",
    "to@xmath1 flux ratio provides an approximate measure of the unobscured ssfr , and thus the combination of these three bands provides a reasonably robust estimate of total ssfr .    using the _ fireworks _ catalog of @xcite we derive proxies for the ir and uv ssfr based on uv/@xmath1 and @xmath162 flux ratios , and use these proxies to obtain order  of  magnitude estimates of the ssfrs of uds galaxies ; the details of this derivation",
    "are given in the appendix .",
    "figure  [ fig_div24um ] shows the @xmath134 diagram in four redshift bins between @xmath163 ( the bin at @xmath164 is not shown , since the ssfr proxies are not expected to be effective at such low redshifts ) .",
    "since the @xmath47 m data are too shallow for most galaxies in this sample to be detected individually , we combine the ssfrs of multiple galaxies as a function of @xmath134 color as follows : at each redshift galaxies are divided into square @xmath134 color bins .",
    "if @xmath165 objects fall into a given bin , a square is plotted with a color corresponding to the _ median _ ssfr of the underlying galaxies ( in essence `` binning '' the galaxies ssfr estimates ) ; otherwise , individual points are plotted .",
    "a strong trend is clearly seen from @xmath166 : the `` quiescent clump '' on average exhibits low ssfr , and is distinctly offset from the adjacent red star  forming galaxies .    in the @xmath167 bin of figure  [ fig_evol ]",
    "the scatter in the @xmath134 diagram is too large for any intrinsic bimodality to be seen , and the trend in ssfr also appears weaker ( figure  [ fig_div24um ] ) , perhaps due in part to the smaller number of points at high redshift and passive evolution . at @xmath7 ,",
    "we employ another approach to verify the presence of galaxies with relatively low sfrs : the top panel of figure  [ fig_rf24um ] again shows the @xmath168 @xmath134 plot , with red galaxies selected by the rectangular boxes shown . the median @xmath47 m flux of the @xmath89 galaxies within each box , measured in 8  diameter apertures , is then calculated . to estimate the uncertainties in the median fluxes ,",
    "@xmath89 apertures were placed randomly on the mips image and the median @xmath47 m flux within these apertures calculated .",
    "this was repeated 500 times for each value of @xmath89 , and the clipped standard deviation of these 500 trials was taken as the uncertainty in the median of the galaxy fluxes for every bin of @xmath89 galaxies .",
    "note that since the randomly ",
    "placed apertures may contain bright and/or confusing @xmath47 m sources , this error estimate inherently takes both background and confusion noise into account .",
    "the median @xmath47 m fluxes within each bin are shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig_rf24um ] ; indeed , @xmath47 m flux increases strongly with @xmath6 color , indicating that @xmath6 does indeed provide a good proxy for star formation rate at @xmath168 ( with a factor of @xmath169 difference in @xmath47 m flux between the bluest and reddest galaxies in @xmath6 ) .",
    "the trends in @xmath47 m flux and ssfr strongly suggest that the @xmath134 selection criteria indeed separate quiescent from star  forming galaxies ( even given the limited number of photometric bands available in uds ) at @xmath170 , and may work reasonably well up to higher redshifts , @xmath171 .",
    "since the color bimodality can no longer be seen at @xmath7 it is possible that the quiescent galaxy sample at these redshifts contains somewhat more contamination from red , star  forming galaxies ; furthermore , the rest  frame @xmath24 flux estimate relies on the relatively shallow @xmath172 m data at @xmath7 , which may result in subtle incompleteness effects in the sample at these redshifts .",
    "therefore , for the remainder of our analysis we focus only on galaxies at @xmath170 where the bimodality can obviously be seen .",
    "it is also important to note that the presence of agn may produce enhanced @xmath47 m emission and redder @xmath6 colors , and thus mimic the photometric effects of star formation . as described in ",
    "[ sec_photz ] , most objects with known strong agn activity do not have valid @xmath2 solutions and have likely been removed from the sample ; even so , some weak agn activity may remain and contribute to the observed correlation .      absolute rest ",

    "this is similar to the result of @xcite , who found star formation rates consistent with zero in 9/20 bright galaxies at @xmath178 , though their spectroscopic determination of sfrs is likely to produce fundamentally different `` quiescent '' samples than our rest ",

    "the angular correlation function of each sample was computed using the @xcite estimator , taking into account all `` bad '' data regions ( described in detail in  [ sec_badpix ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_acf ] shows these functions for the quiescent and star  forming samples , with the former clearly exhibiting stronger clustering ( in angular space ) than the latter .    because of the large number of objects in this catalog at @xmath9 , it is possible to further break each of the quiescent and star  forming samples into bright and faint subsamples , thereby also investigating the effect of luminosity on clustering strength .",
    "angular correlation functions were recomputed for star  forming and quiescent galaxies within two luminosity bins divided at @xmath181 .",
    "this is approximately the minimum luminosity at which the @xmath9 sample is complete  essentially all galaxies with @xmath182 at @xmath183 have observed @xmath1 fluxes brighter than the @xmath3 cutoff , while at @xmath184 some galaxies ( most of which are low  mass and blue ) fall below the @xmath1 flux limit .",

    "the slope of the spatial correlation function is fixed to 1.6 , which is consistent with each of the subsamples studied here , and the uncertainties are estimated using bootstrap resampling .",
    "the resulting clustering lengths of the quiescent and star  forming samples in both luminosity bins are shown in figure  [ fig_r0 ] .",
    "the clustering of bright quiescent galaxies is stronger ( at @xmath187 significance ) than that of the bright star  forming sample , with @xmath188h@xmath21mpc and @xmath189h@xmath21mpc respectively , and the difference in clustering length becomes far more pronounced in the fainter bin . for the faint quiescent and star ",
    "forming galaxies would _ increase _ with a deeper @xmath1 flux limit .",
    "] interestingly , the clustering length of quiescent galaxies appears to be independent of luminosity ; star  forming galaxies , on the other hand , exhibit a marginal increase in clustering strength with luminosity .",
    "the stronger clustering of bright galaxies in the _ combined _ ( star  forming plus quiescent ) sample thus appears to be driven by both the larger quiescent fraction among bright galaxies as well as the stronger clustering of star  forming galaxies .",
    "the exact criteria used to divide the `` quiescent '' and `` star  forming '' samples ( i.e. the lines shown in figure  [ fig_evol ] ) may have an effect on this result . while we chose the diagonal dividing line to lie centered between the star  forming track and quiescent `` clump , '' this is not necessarily the best criterion .",
    "for example , moving the line `` upward '' ( toward redder @xmath5 and bluer @xmath6 ) would result in a less complete sample of quiescent galaxies that is also less contaminated by star  forming galaxies scattering across the line ; similarly , moving the line down toward the star  forming track increases completeness at the expense of contamination . to check",
    "whether this affects the clustering measurement , we moved the diagonal divider by @xmath190  magnitudes in both directions and re  calculated the @xmath185 values .",
    "the perturbed @xmath185 values were all within @xmath132 of the old values , with one exception : when the dividing line was moved upwards ( i.e. defining a less complete quiescent galaxy sample with less contamination ) , the clustering strength of bright ( @xmath182 ) quiescent galaxies increased by @xmath191",
    ". therefore , the result that quiescent galaxies exhibit a larger clustering length appears robust to the color criteria used to select the quiescent sample .",
    "the clustering length we have found for quiescent galaxies at @xmath9 is fully consistent with the value of @xmath192mpc for @xmath193 drgs in this catalog @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as roughly half of the @xmath194 drgs in this sample fall within the `` quiescent '' @xmath134 selection region .",
    "the presence of a bimodal population of galaxies in the @xmath134 plane to at least @xmath0 is consistent with previous spectroscopic studies , such as @xcite , who find a nascent red sequence at @xmath195 .",
    "the purely photometric analysis presented herein allows much larger samples of quiescent galaxies to be found , albeit with lower confidence for any individual object . at first glance",
    ", however , this appears to be in conflict with the @xcite claim that the galaxy bimodality disappears at @xmath196 .",
    "in fact , the apparent discrepancy between these results is probably due to observational effects : @xcite consider only bimodality in the rest ",
    "frame color ",
    "magnitude ( @xmath143 vs.  @xmath197 ) diagram , i.e.  the `` red sequence '' method .",
    "indeed , as the right panel of figure  [ fig_dahist ] shows , such a plot does not show a bimodal population of galaxies at @xmath198 , even though the bimodality is still present in the @xmath134 diagram .",
    "similarly , the absence of a bimodal distribution in the @xmath134 diagram at @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig_dahist ] , left panel ) does not necessarily imply the disappearance of bimodality in the underlying galaxy population , but rather reflects the larger photometric and @xmath2 uncertainties at these redshifts ( as can also be seen from the large @xmath134 error bars at @xmath199 ; figure  [ fig_evol ] ) .    using a single rest ",
    "frame color ( determined via photometric redshifts ) to select quiescent and star  forming galaxies can obscure an underlying bimodality for two reasons : ( 1 ) the population of dusty , star  forming galaxies increases with redshift , and these have significant overlap their optical colors with any red , quiescent galaxies that may be present ; and ( 2 ) the greater scatter in the rest  frame @xmath5 or @xmath143 at higher redshifts can effectively wash out the intrinsic red sequence .",
    "this increased scatter is due not only to the larger uncertainties on measured photometry of fainter galaxies at large redshift , but also the larger photometric redshift uncertainties @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , @xmath143 by itself is only effective at distinguishing quiescent from dusty galaxies when accurate spectroscopic redshifts are available ; with photometric redshifts the rest ",
    "frame color uncertainty is too large to see the quiescent red sequence .",
    "the use of @xmath6 in addition to @xmath5 helps mitigate both of these problems : @xmath6 separates red , quiescent galaxies from red , dust  obscured starbursts ( figure  [ fig_rfcol ] ) , and a two  dimensional color bimodality is more resilient to increased scatter than a single color .",
    "thus , when only photometric redshifts are available , the two ",
    "color @xmath134 technique employed herein appears to provide a `` cleaner '' selection of high  redshift , quiescent galaxies than standard red  sequence methods .",
    "the differences between high  redshift quiescent and star  forming galaxy properties can provide clues to the physical mechanisms behind star formation ( or the lack thereof ) . in the moderately high  redshift ( @xmath9 ) sample considered here , the most striking contrasts between the two populations are in their clustering strengths and luminosities .",
    "quiescent galaxies cluster more strongly than those undergoing active star formation ( implying , from standard cdm theory , that they reside preferentially in higher  mass halos ) and typically exhibit brighter absolute @xmath124 magnitudes , comprising about half of the bright galaxy population at all redshifts",
    ". however , the clustering strength of quiescent galaxies does not appear to be strongly dependent on luminosity : as shown in figure  [ fig_r0 ] , the bright and faint quiescent samples exhibit roughly equal clustering lengths , which in turn are consistently higher than the corresponding values for star  forming galaxies .",
    "this may be indicative of a characteristic halo mass above which star formation is inhibited .",
    "our results may be taken to suggest that the star formation - density relation was already in place at @xmath152 , with quiescent galaxies more strongly clustered and hence situated , on average , in denser regions . on first glance",
    "this would seem to contradict recent claims of a `` reversal '' of the star formation ",
    "density relation that occurs at @xmath200 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these authors present evidence that the average sfr per galaxy in dense regions is higher than in less dense regions , in contrast to the well  known relationship in the local universe . whether this constitutes",
    "a `` reversal '' is in part a matter of terminology ; it may be true that the typical star formation rate increases with environmental density ( as found by , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this does not preclude the possibility that the relatively rare quiescent galaxies are preferentially found in the densest regions ( as suggested by our results ) .",
    "we also note that the star formation  density relation may be qualitatively different depending on whether one is considering absolute star formation rates or specific star formation rates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the observed segregation of quiescent and star  forming galaxies both in clustering strength and luminosity suggests strong links between halo mass , stellar mass , and the cessation of star formation .",
    "different theoretical bases for the quenching of star formation in galaxies hosted by massive halos have been proposed , some focusing on radio  mode agn feedback processes which prevent further gas cooling and star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , while others suggest that hot accretion and shock processes in high  mass halos may be sufficient to produce quiescent galaxies without invoking agn @xcite .",
    "although these models may not represent the definitive explanation for the observational results presented here , the correspondence between theory and observation is nonetheless intriguing .",
    "further observations of large quiescent galaxy samples ( e.g. , comparing the radio emission of high@xmath43 quiescent and star  forming galaxies ) are likely to shed further light on the underlying quenching mechanism .",
    "this analysis employs photometric redshifts , which of course are much less well  constrained than those determined using spectroscopy .",
    "furthermore , the number of spectroscopic redshifts for comparison is quite small , with 119 available spec@xmath43s in this field .",
    "essentially all of these known redshifts are from two samples , neither of which can be considered unbiased : a set of @xmath115 old passively  evolving galaxies , and galaxies selected from their radio emission ( thus all likely exhibiting some degree of agn activity ) . if anything , one might expect photometric redshift determinations to be worse in this latter sample since the templates used to derive the phot@xmath43s do not include agn activity ; however , figure  [ fig_zcompare ] shows that the fits are actually quite good from about @xmath201 ( and the worst outliers , including two  thirds those with signatures of agn , are excluded through either a @xmath113 cut or the lack of a @xmath2 solution ) .",
    "the fit to the `` old '' @xmath115 galaxy sample was even better , with fractional redshift errors on the order of 2% .",
    "at @xmath202 it is likely that these fractional errors are _ at least _",
    "@xmath203 , the scatter found in the eazy ",
    "derived photometric redshifts from the cdfs  goods catalog ( which included several more photometric bands than the uds@xmath204sxds@xmath204swire dataset ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is nonetheless possible that some additional systematic errors remain in the photometric redshifts .",
    "such errors would manifest themselves as shifts in the rest  frame colors , the magnitude of which primarily depend on the galaxy redshift and template shape .",
    "however , the results presented herein are not dependent on the exact rest ",
    "frame colors themselves , but rather on the relative separation between the quiescent and star  forming populations .",
    "since the two populations are clearly visible from @xmath205 ( figure  [ fig_evol ] ) , and the positions of galaxies in the @xmath134 plane are strongly correlated with @xmath47 m flux ( figure  [ fig_div24um ] ) , we conclude that we can distinguish populations of galaxies based on their _ relative _ star  formation rates .",
    "it is nonetheless important to note that the _ absolute _ values of the interpolated rest  frame colors may still be subject to systematic , possibly redshift  dependent offsets , and these offsets may be different depending on the sed ( e.g. for quiescent and star  forming galaxies ) .",
    "further differences are likely to come about with differing photometric redshift codes and techniques for determining rest  frame colors .",
    "this underscores the importance of defining such empirical color cuts based on the actual data and analysis techniques employed ; relying on criteria defined on other datasets can lead to inaccurate results .",
    "another possible source of error is the ability of sextractor to deblend close pairs of objects .",
    "where two extended sources overlap , or if the separation of two point sources is smaller than a few times the @xmath1band psf fwhm ( @xmath20607 ) , oftentimes the two objects will be counted as a single object . in this case , the galaxy clustering is probably underestimated at the smallest scales ( @xmath207  or so ) . even if they are successfully identified as separate objects ,",
    "the fixed color apertures used to measure fluxes are likely to be contaminated , and thus may cause errors in photometric redshifts and rest  frame colors . however , the fraction of objects in such close pairs is negligible compared to the total catalog .",
    "furthermore , these clustering results are based on larger ",
    "scale correlations  i.e .",
    ", we do not calculate the clustering below @xmath208 .",
    "thus , this incompleteness at the smallest scales is unlikely to affect our results .",
    "from our matched multiband uds@xmath204sxds@xmath204swire @xmath1selected catalog we have derived reliable photometric redshifts and rest  frame colors . for a relatively bright ( @xmath3 ) subsample of this catalog",
    ", we find that :    1 .",
    "galaxies show strong bimodal behavior in rest ",
    "frame @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 color  color space , with one population of `` dead '' ( non  star forming ) galaxies , and a sequence of dusty , actively star  forming galaxies .",
    "this behavior can be seen out to @xmath0 , so the observed present ",
    "day galaxy bimodality was present at least to this redshift ; however , at @xmath202 the bimodality is not seen in a single  color  magnitude diagram .",
    "2 .   from @xmath209 to @xmath210 , the rest  frame @xmath6 color ( at red @xmath5 colors ) shows a strong correlation with our estimates of specific star ",
    "formation rate , indicating that the @xmath6 color is a reliable tracer of star formation activity even at @xmath7 where the rest ",
    "frame color uncertainties are too large for the bimodality to be seen .",
    "3 .   quiescent and star  forming galaxies at @xmath180 contribute roughly equally to the overall galaxy population at the brightest @xmath124 luminosities ; the less luminous population is dominated by actively star  forming objects .",
    "the clustering strength of quiescent galaxies from @xmath9 appears to be independent of galaxy luminosity , and is consistently stronger than the clustering of the actively star  forming galaxies ; thus , `` dead '' galaxies appear to occupy more massive halos than those which are in the process of forming stars .",
    "this suggests a link between halo mass and the early cessation of star formation activity .",
    "forthcoming data releases of the ukidss uds , including deep @xmath25band data and ultimately reaching a depth of @xmath211 ( ab ) , will allow these results to be tested with even fainter , higher  redshift galaxies .",
    "more importantly , the 290hour ultra  deep _ spitzer _",
    "legacy survey of the uds field ( _ spuds _ ; pi : j.  dunlop ) currently being undertaken will provide at least an order  of  magnitude increase in exposure time compared to the swire data used in this paper , giving much  improved constraints on photometric redshifts , agn activity , and rest ",

    "@xmath47 m data are shallow , and the necessary detailed models for determining galaxy masses and the @xmath47m@xmath212 conversions are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , to test the validity of the @xmath134 colors as a tracer of ssfr , such precision is not necessary : simple order  of  magnitude estimates will suffice .    over the redshift range @xmath163 , we therefore resort to a proxy based entirely on observed photometry and calibrated with the chandra deep field  south _",

    "reliable ssfrs were derived from _ fireworks _ based on the rest ",
    "frame 2800   luminosity and observed @xmath47 m fluxes ( wuyts et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the sum of these two contributions should then approximate the total amount of star formation in `` typical '' galaxies ( i.e. those without extreme obscuration , like smgs ) .",
    "since @xmath1 flux is itself a tracer of stellar mass , it follows that the @xmath213 flux ratio ( for some observed band that falls in or near the rest  frame ultraviolet ) can provide a rough estimate of the unobscured ssfr , and @xmath214 should do the same for the `` dusty '' ssfr .    from the _ fireworks _ data we find that a single linear relation sufficiently describes the correlation between the ir ssfr and @xmath214 over @xmath163 .",
    "there is also a strong correlation between uv ssfr and @xmath215 ; however , the exact slope and normalization of the relation appear to change abruptly at @xmath115 ; for the uv relation we thus perform separate linear fits at @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "this uv proxy is somewhat flatter ( i.e. insensitive to @xmath215 ) than the @xmath47m  sfr relation , and substantially underestimates the largest uv ssfrs by a factor of @xmath218 , but it appears to accurately reproduce relatively low ssfrs ( @xmath219yr@xmath21 ) ; thus , this uv proxy is effectively used as an additive term to correct the fluxes of galaxies which are faint in @xmath47 m . the best ",
    "fit relations , shown in figure  [ fig_ssfrrel ] , are : @xmath220 note that the uv relations formally yield substantially negative ssfr values even when @xmath221 , since ssfr@xmath222 is not quite a linear function of @xmath215 ; thus , we require that the uv contribution to the total ssfr be positive ( i.e. for any object where ssfr@xmath223 , we set ssfr@xmath224 ) .",
    "since a large number of galaxies have @xmath225 due to background noise , and the ssfr@xmath226 relation appears very close to linear , we do allow individual objects to have ssfr@xmath227 in the stacking analysis .",
