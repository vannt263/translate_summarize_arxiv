    "the combination of nlo  matrix elements with parton showering algorithms is a natural way to proceed and would provide an exclusive monte carlo description of collision events .",
    "this goal has two primary challenges : ( 1 ) a probabilistic interpretation of nlo  matrix elements is difficult to accomplish on account of the delicate cancellations which occur between the virtual and real emission graphs .",
    "this generally results in event weights which may be both positive or negative .",

    "the resultant events can be interpreted probabilistically ( event weights are positive definite ) and the nlo  predictions for observable distributions are preserved .",
    "the drawback is that by integrating the volume of jets the specific jet configuration is lost  determining which configuration is most probable brings back the problem of negative weights .",

    "the phase space accessible to the parton shower ( the parton shower region ) is a subset of the full ( n+1)-body  phase space .",
    "the boundary of the dead zone region inaccessible to the herwig  parton shower is defined by  @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of the color singlet object ( @xmath1 system in this case ) , @xmath15 is the mass of the color singlet and parton emission system ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the machine energy , and @xmath28 is the angle of the emission with respect to the beam in the center of mass frame .",
    "the partition of phase space in the @xmath29 vs. @xmath30 plane is shown in figure  [ shat_costheta_plane ] .",
    "the parton shower and dead zone regions are precisely complementary , so there can be no double counting when sampling the regions separately . the dead zone is the region of hard central emissions and can be populated by sampling the first order tree level matrix element within the boundaries defined in eqs .",
    "[ shat_limit ]  and  [ cos_limit ] . adding the dead zone phase space in this manner to the showering event generator simulation",

    "for single boson production the improvement in the boson recoil transverse momentum spectrum  @xcite is remarkable , particularly at high @xmath5 .    `",
    "soft matrix element corrections '  @xcite refers to correcting emissions generated by the parton shower algorithm using the first order tree level matrix element . since the herwig  parton shower ordering variable is an energy - weighted angle which does not necessarily imply ordering in transverse momentum , it is necessary to apply the correction to every emission which has the highest @xmath5 so far .",
    "the soft corrections are described for the single boson production case in ref.@xcite and were noted to have a small effect in comparison to the hard matrix element corrections for single boson production .",
    "the main advantage of the soft corrections is in providing for a smooth transition between the parton shower and dead zone regions  though in practice it is difficult to find observables sensitive to this transition .",
    "the primary difference with regards to soft corrections for diboson production as compared to the single boson case are the real emission graphs involving a gluon anchored to an internal line , such as the one shown in figure  [ internal_line ] .",
    "these graphs are absent for the single boson case and are in no way approximated by the parton shower which traces only external lines .",
    "in contrast to the other emission graphs , these graph do not have any collinear singularities .",
    "this means that their relative contribution to the cross section is largest in the central regions ( since other emission graphs dominate in the collinear regions ) .",
    "thus , the relative effect of these graphs in the parton shower region is small , and it is more important to account for them in the dead zone region where the physics of these graphs may become important",
    ". the present study uses the soft matrix element corrections already implemented in herwig  for single boson production . since the emission cross section enters only as a ratio to the born cross section , the herwig  implementation accounts for the first order emission from an external line of feynman graphs for color singlet production to good approximation , but does not account for emissions from an internal line . implementing the soft corrections for the specific case of @xmath1 production would require intrusive changes to the herwig  parton shower code . by accepting this approximation ,",
    "the herwig  code is kept unmodified and modular .",
    "nevertheless it is recognized that explicit diboson soft matrix element corrections would be a useful extension to this study .",
    "the herwig  soft matrix element corrections ( which are approximate for the diboson case ) have very little impact on the distributions presented in this paper .",
    "it is expected that the exact soft matrix element corrections ( i.e.  explicitly including all diboson graphs ) would not change the situation in an appreciable way .",
    "lo and matrix element corrected distributions for hadronic @xmath1 production are obtained by implementing the born level n - body  process and tree level ( n+1)-body   process ( restricted to the dead zone ) as external processes in herwig   using the bho  matrix elements . for diboson production , the distribution corresponding to the single vector boson production transverse recoil studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is the diboson system recoil @xmath6 .",
    "a comparison to the nlo  result for this distribution is shown in figure  [ ptwzhardme ] for the lo with parton shower , first order tree level in the dead zone , and matrix element corrected results . away from the low @xmath5 region ,",
    "the shape of the matrix element corrected result agrees well with the nlo  prediction from the stand - alone bho integration package , demonstrating the effectiveness of hard matrix element corrections .",
    "there is no contribution from the dead zone in the very low @xmath6 region , so the born and matrix element corrected results coincide in this region ( figure  [ ptwzhardme ] , inset ) .",
    "the soft matrix element corrected lo result is indistinguishable from the lo curve and is not shown .",
    "it is more common in the literature to study the @xmath31 distribution , for example in probing the triple gauge boson vertex for anomalous couplings .",
    "this distribution is also sensitive to hard emissions in the dead zone , as shown in figure  [ ptzhardme ] where , as for the @xmath32 spectrum , the shape of the matrix element corrected @xmath31 distribution is a good approximation to the nlo   result .",
    "drawbacks in the matrix element corrections approach and fixed order calculation are evident in figure  [ ptwzhardme ] .",
    "the nlo  calculation is not reliable in the very low @xmath5 region shown in the inset of figure  [ ptwzhardme ] .",
    "the nlo  prediction shows a dip just below 5  gev and a very large contribution at zero .",

    "the use of the subtraction method  @xcite for the @xmath6 distribution in the inset of figure  [ ptwzhardme ] also yields an unphysical negative first histogram bin .",
    "this effect serves as a reminder that fixed order perturbation theory is not well suited for predictions of small inclusive @xmath5 . ]",
    "a disadvantage of the matrix element corrected distributions is the lo normalization in the parton shower region .",
    "since the total matrix element corrected cross section is the sum of the born level and the integrated dead zone cross sections , it depends explicitly on the dead zone boundary defined by eqs .  [ shat_limit ]  and  [ cos_limit ] .",
    "a change in the boundary would result in a change in the total cross section . the use of nlo  calculations everywhere would remove this dependence and provide a more accurate prediction of the total cross section , particularly for multi - tev colliders where the contribution from the gluon ( anti-)quark initial state is substantial .",
    "a second drawback of the matrix element corrections is the inability to model nlo  shape effects in the parton shower region .",
    "the approximate radiation zero , which is partially filled in by nlo  corrections , is an example of a distribution which is sensitive to these effects .",
    "observation of this as yet unseen phenomenon will be a goal of future hadron colliders .",
    "this distribution is shown in figure  [ ywzhardme ] , together with the ratio ( or @xmath34-factors ) of the matrix element corrected and born distributions with respect to the nlo  distributions .",
    "the @xmath34-factors are largest in the central radiation zero region and the matrix element corrections are successful in greatly reducing this effect .",
    "however , a small variation in @xmath34-factors in the zero rapidity separation region remains after applying the matrix element corrections .",
    "in the dead zone the square of the real emission graphs ( @xmath35 ) is the only contribution to the cross section and the divergent regions of the real emission phase space are excluded . outside of the dead zone",
    "the parton shower is better suited at predicting event shapes and exclusive distributions , though it provides no information on the normalization which in showering event generators is normally derived from the lo cross section only . in this region it is preferable to obtain the normalization from the full nlo  cross section while preserving the exclusive event structure from the parton shower .    in the parton shower region the square of the born graphs , the interference of the born graphs with the one - loop graphs , and the square of the real emissions graphs contribute at nlo ,",
    "@xmath36 the first two terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ nlo_me ] are described by n - body  kinematics and occupy a point at @xmath37 of figure  [ shat_costheta_plane ] .",
    "the last term is described by ( n+1)-body  kinematics and may populate the entire @xmath29 vs. @xmath30 plane .",
    "a regularization scheme is necessary to handle the soft , collinear , and ultraviolet divergences which appear when any of the first order contributions are treated alone .",
    "the bho   matrix elements use the phase space slicing method  @xcite ( pss ) wherein a small portion ( denoted on figure  [ shat_costheta_plane ] ) of the ( n+1)-body  phase space ( defined by soft and collinear cutoff parameters @xmath38 ) is included in the n - body  contribution by means of the soft gluon and leading pole approximations .",
    "one way of achieving nlo  normalization while gaining sensitivity to the effect of nlo  corrections on the @xmath1 system configuration is to assign an event weight for the hard process which is the average nlo  cross section ( including virtual graphs ) across the entire region accessible to the parton shower for a particular choice of the @xmath1 system configuration .",
    "since all of the divergent regions are contained within the parton shower region , this number is well behaved and positive definite  but is difficult to calculate analytically .",
    "this average cross section can be obtained by means of a 2nd stage integration as outlined in ref .",
    "it is also noted that it is not necessary to obtain this number with a high degree of accuracy  so long as the average of many such integrations ( i.e.   events ) converges to the correct cross section , which is automatic using the monte carlo method .    for the present algorithm",
    "the jet volume has a simple definition ( eqs .",
    "[ shat_limit ]  and  [ cos_limit ] ) with the convenient feature that the phase space slicing method jet volume is a subset of this volume .",
    "this means the phase space slicing method can be used to achieve a large portion of the jet volume integration and that the result is not sensitive to the specific choice of pss cutoff parameters which specify the pss boundary . as such , the maximal pss cutoffs ( which remain within the range of validity of the soft gluon and leading pole approximations )",
    "may be used ( @xmath33 have been used , see ref.@xcite for a definition of the cutoffs ) .",
    "this is a significant advantage because the subset occupied by the pss volume is the region where delicate cancellations between the n - body  and ( n+1)-body  graphs occur and also where the cross section is peaked .    the 2nd stage integration , which is performed once for each event in the parton shower region , is accomplished as follows .",
    "a @xmath1 event with n - body  kinematics is generated ( 8 degrees of freedom specify the n - body  configuration assuming the vector bosons are taken on shell : e.g.  the @xmath1 system mass @xmath39 , @xmath1 system rapidity @xmath40 , the 2 angles defining the vector boson production , and 2 angles for each of the vector boson decays ) and defines the @xmath1 system configuration and boost . for a lo showering monte carlo event",
    ", the born level cross section would be evaluated and constitute the event weight . instead , the aim is to evaluate the average cross section of the phase space into which the parton shower may evolve the event .",
    "the nlo  n - body  cross section is calculated using the bho  matrix element which requires a further 4 degrees of freedom to specify the soft and collinear corrections arising in the pss method .",
    "thus by integrating over these 4 degrees of freedom the average n - body  weight @xmath41 is obtained and accounts for the region inside the pss boundary ( on the left side of the dashed line ) in figure  [ shat_costheta_plane ] .",
    "this number may be negative . for the integration of the remainder of the parton shower region an emission",
    "is explicitly sampled using 3 additional degrees of freedom ( e.g.  the @xmath26 system mass and the 2 angles specifying the emission direction ) .",
    "these 11 degrees of freedom ( 3 plus 8 from the n - body  configuration ) specify the ( n+1)-body  kinematics .",
    "it is necessary to use the appropriate overall boost , so as to span the identical phase space the herwig  parton shower is able to reach from the n - body  kinematics .",
    "herwig  applies a conformal boost to the hard process which keeps the hard process mass and rapidity fixed .",
    "for the ( n+1)-body  case the @xmath26 system rapidity is thus @xmath42 where @xmath43 is identified as the @xmath1 system rapidity and @xmath44 is the @xmath1 system 4-vector in the @xmath26 frame .",
    "the jacobian for the transformation @xmath45 is unity . by sampling the 3 degrees of freedom which specify the expansion from n - body  to ( n+1)-body  kinematics and evaluating the nlo  matrix element each time ( always a positive number ) , an integration over the remainder of the parton shower region",
    "is achieved giving the average ( n+1)-body  weight @xmath46 .",
    "the cross section for the specific choice of @xmath1 configuration averaged over the parton shower region at nlo  is @xmath47 and constitutes the event weight .",
    "the input to the parton shower algorithm is the n - body  kinematic configuration .",
    "the parton shower algorithm ( with guidance from the soft matrix element corrections ) determines which exclusive emission structure is chosen for the event .",
    "event generation for the nlo  @xmath1 process consists of generating a sample of events in the parton shower region using the 2nd stage integration method discussed above and a second sample of events in the dead zone , as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ hardme ] .",
    "the event weights for both types of events are positive numbers ( unlike for the nlo  integration packages which produces events with both positive and negative weights ) so the usual event generator strategy of hit - and - miss may be used to obtain unweighted event samples .",
    "the cross sections for the regions of interest are enumerated in table  [ cross_sections ] for @xmath48 production at lhc with decays to electron / muon - type leptons .",
    "the total born level cross section is almost a ( @xmath34-)factor 1.5 down from the nlo  result .",
    "the dead zone accounts for about 8% of the total cross section .",
    "the sum of the integrated parton shower region cross section and the dead zone cross section agrees with the total nlo  cross section which serves as a cross check that the parton shower region contribution is correctly evaluated with the 2nd stage integration .    in figure  [ ptwzfullme ]",
    "the transverse recoil of the @xmath1 system is shown for this 2nd stage integration method ( which also includes matrix element corrections ) . the normalization is the same as the nlo  normalization by construction . the nlo  and matrix element corrected results from figure  [ ptwzhardme ] are superimposed . in the region of moderate to high",
    "@xmath6 the result agrees well with the nlo  prediction . in the region of smaller @xmath6 ,",
    "events with low transverse momentum receive extra recoil from multiple emissions and are pushed towards slightly higher @xmath6 . at very small",
    "@xmath6 ( inset ) the shape agrees very well with the parton shower distribution and goes smoothly to zero with no dependence on the nlo  regularization scheme .",
    "the ratio to the fixed nlo   distribution is slightly flatter ( fig .",
    "[ ptwzfullme ] , bottom ) than for the matrix element corrected distribution .",
    "a second distribution which is sensitive to the region of small inclusive jet @xmath5 is the azimuthal separation of the vector bosons shown in figure  [ phifullme ] .",
    "as the separation approaches @xmath49 , the inclusive jet @xmath5 goes to zero and the fixed order prediction becomes unreliable , as evidenced by the sharp increase in differential cross section very near @xmath50 .",
    "the 2nd stage integration and matrix element corrected results do not suffer from this discontinuity and give a smooth , physical prediction across the full range which is higher than the nlo  result away from @xmath50 .",
    "this is an example of a distribution where the nlo  prediction is not accurate .",
    "the @xmath2 transverse momentum is shown in figure  [ ptzfullme ] for the 2nd stage integration method , the matrix element corrections , and the nlo  calculation .",
    "the 2nd stage integration is in good agreement with the nlo  prediction throughout , while the matrix element corrections suffer from normalization problems .",
    "the nlo  calculation is accurate in the low @xmath31 region for this observable since an integration over a large range of inclusive jet @xmath5 is automatic for the low @xmath31 bins .",
    "the rapidity separation of the vector bosons is shown in figures  [ ywzfullme ] for the 2nd stage integration method , the matrix element corrections , and the nlo  calculation .",
    "the 2nd stage integration is in good agreement with the nlo  prediction throughout , with a very slight enhancement visible in the radiation zero region due to multiple emissions .",
    "the ratio of the 2nd stage integration distribution to the nlo  result is unity and almost constant throughout , whereas the matrix element corrected ratio is about 1.3 with a small variation in the zero separation region .",
    "the 2nd stage integration has accounted for the effects of the first order corrections on the @xmath1 system configuration ( including the separation in rapidity ) and so this small variation is not present in that distribution .      for all of the 2nd stage integration method distributions ( figures  [ ptwzfullme]-[ywzfullme ] ) the integration over the parton shower region ( performed once per event )",
    "is accomplished with 50  samples of the 3  degrees of freedom which define the expansion to ( n+1)-body  phase space and 10  samples of the 4  degrees of freedom which define the n - body  pss corrections .",
    "the 2nd stage integration increases the computer time required to generate one weighted event with the herwig  showering event generator by a factor 1.3 .",
    "this is due mostly to the integration , but also to the added number of mathematical operations necessary to evaluate the nlo  matrix element as compared to the lo one .",
    "since the n - body  contribution can be negative , the total event weight ( eq .  [ eventweight ] ) can be within statistical precision of zero if the integration statistics ( number of samples ) are small enough and the cancellations ( between n - body  and ( n+1)-body  contributions ) are large enough .",
    "this means that negative events can very occasionally occur ( a discussion of 2nd stage integration negative weighted events is given in ref .",
    "negative events of this type are simply discarded .",
    "the bias introduced by discarding these negative events is easy to evaluate .",
    "the absolute value of the discarded negative weight events is superimposed on figures  [ ptwzfullme]-[ywzfullme ] as a shaded histogram .",
    "these histograms are 5 orders of magnitude below the 2nd stage integration distributions ( too small to resolve on figures  [ phifullme ]  and  [ ywzfullme ] ) and are largest in the region where the differential cross section is also largest , and so the effect of these negative events is everywhere negligible .    it is possible to use as few as one sample of each type ( n - body  and ( n+1)-body ) for the 2nd stage ` integration ' .",
    "the effect of decreasing the samples in this way is to increase the frequency of negative weight events  in this case the bias increases to 1% , which represents a maximum ceiling for the bias .",
    "finally it is noted that an adaptation of the pss method may eliminate the negative event weights entirely allowing for the unbiased use of a single sample to evaluate the parton shower region cross section . in ref .",
    "@xcite a hybrid  @xcite of the subtraction and the one parameter pss regularization schemes is investigated . for each n - body  configuration",
    "the pss cutoff parameter which gives a zero n - body  contribution is calculated  in this manner the virtual and real emission cancellations are enforced and all of the phase space is partitioned to be ( n+1)-body .",
    "one concern with this method is that the minimum jet energy is coupled to the n - body   momentum configuration .",
    "however , there can be no bias for any observable which is insensitive to the specific pss boundary for a given n - body  configuration .",
    "so long as the hybrid pss region is everywhere contained within the parton shower region ( which is expected to be the case ) , the average cross section of the parton shower region is one such number  and so this method could be employed to evaluate the 2nd stage integration . in this manner the nlo  cross section across the parton shower region ( eq .  [ eventweight ] ) can be represented with a single sample , which with this hybrid method is always a positive number .",
    "the weights of many such events will converge to the correct cross section , and event generation would proceed with a single sampling of the phase space , as it normally does for lo showering event generators .",
    "the important difference is that in the parton shower region information about the parton emission would be discarded and the n - body  kinematic configuration would be used as input for the parton shower , which eliminates the possibility of the jet energy coupling since , as described previously , the parton shower ( guided by the soft matrix element corrections ) would determine which exclusive event structure is chosen for the event .",
    "matrix element corrections for hadronic diboson production have been implemented following the procedure outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite and are interfaced to the herwig  showering event generator .",
    "the corrections are significant in the high-@xmath5 regions where the agreement in shape with nlo  calculations is significantly improved .",
    "a new method for incorporating the full nlo  matrix element is presented .",
    "the inclusive recoil against emissions is dominated by the parton shower for events in the soft and collinear regions where the parton shower is expected to give a good description of the physics , and is dominated by the first order matrix element for events in the hard central region where perturbation theory provides a reliable prediction . the normalization is everywhere nlo .",
    "events generated with this method have positive definite event weight , such that unweighted events can be easily produced by means of monte carlo hit - and - miss .",
    "the method is generalizable to any color singlet production process .",
    "the numerical implementation of the method is straight - forward providing a nlo  matrix element ( employing the pss regularization scheme ) is available .",
    "the difference in distribution shapes between the matrix element correction approach and the 2nd stage integration incorporating the full nlo  matrix element is small  though noticeable for example in distributions such as the diboson rapidity separation .",
    "the 2nd stage integration approach has the further advantage of providing nlonormalization .",
    "diboson event samples from hadron colliders to date are small and insensitive to qcd corrections , so a meaningful comparison to data will have to await tevatron run  ii and lhc .",
