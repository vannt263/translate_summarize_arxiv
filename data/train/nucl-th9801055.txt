    "the properties of baryonic and mesonic resonances in the nuclear medium has received a vivid attention during the last years ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) within the studies on the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter . here , qcd inspired effective lagrangian models  @xcite or approaches based on qcd sum rules  @xcite predict that the masses of the vector mesons @xmath0 and @xmath7 should decrease with the nuclear density . on the other hand , with a dropping hadron mass the phase space for its decay decreases , which results in a modification of its width or lifetime in matter , while due to interactions with the surrounding nuclear medium the resonance width will increase  @xcite .",
    "the in - medium properties of vector mesons have been addressed experimentally so far by dilepton measurements at the sps , both for proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite . as proposed by li _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the enhancement in @xmath8 reactions compared to @xmath9 collisions in the invariant mass range @xmath10 gev might be due to a shift of the @xmath0 meson mass .",
    "the microscopic transport studies in refs .",
    "@xcite for these systems point in the same direction , however , also more conventional selfenergy effects can not be ruled out at the present stage  @xcite .",
    "especially the p - wave coupling of the @xmath0-meson to nucleons induces an attractive interaction at low relative momenta  @xcite which turns repulsive at large momenta .",
    "the explicit momentum dependence of the @xmath0-meson selfenergy thus is an important aspect to be investigated both , theoretically and experimentally e.g. by @xmath11 reactions  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to calculate the explicit momentum dependence of the @xmath0-meson potential at finite nuclear densities within a dispersive approach that is based on the resonance model at low relative momenta of the @xmath0 with respect to the nucleon at rest and the vector dominance model at high relative momenta following the suggestion by eletsky and joffe  @xcite .",
    "our work is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly recall the relation between hadron self energies and the hadron - nucleon scattering amplitude at low density and discuss the dominant interaction mechanisms . in section 3",
    "we present the related dispersion relations and evaluate the @xmath1 scattering amplitude from the @xmath0- photoproduction cross section at high energy . at low energy",
    "we use a resonance model to determine the @xmath12 cross section .",
    "the implications for the real and imaginary part of the @xmath0-meson selfenergy at finite nuclear density are presented in section 4 while a summary and discussion of open problems concludes this work in section 5 .",
    "the relativistic form of the wave equation describing the propagation of a mesonic resonance @xmath13 in the nuclear matter is given as ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the momentum , mass and width of the resonance , respectively .",
    "the optical potential then is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the forward @xmath21-scattering amplitude and @xmath22 is the nuclear density .",
    "it is useful to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ waveeq ] ) in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inverse resonance propagator in the vacuum .",
    "the four - momentum @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) can be defined through the four - momenta of the resonance decay products , i.e. @xmath26    when the resonance decays inside the nucleus of radius @xmath27 at density @xmath22 , the propagator has the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 its spectral function then can be described ( in a first approximation ) by a breit  wigner formula ( nonrelativistically ) as @xmath31 which contains the effects of collisional broadening , @xmath32 with @xmath33 and a shift of the meson mass @xmath34 with @xmath35 in eqs .",
    "( [ dgamma]),([dmstar ] ) @xmath36 is the average resonance velocity with respect to the target at rest , @xmath37 is the associated lorentz factor , @xmath22 is the nuclear density while @xmath38 is the resonance - nucleon total cross section and @xmath39    the sign of the resonance mass shift depends on the sign of the real part of the forward @xmath21 scattering amplitude which again depends on the momentum of the resonance . for example , at low momenta ( p @xmath40 0 ) various authors  @xcite predict a decreasing mass of the vector mesons @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath41 with the nucleon density , whereas eletsky and ioffe have argued recently  @xcite that the @xmath0-meson should become heavier in nuclear matter at momenta of 2 - 7  gev / c",
    ". if the ratio @xmath42 is small - which is actually the case for the reactions considered because many reaction channels are open - the broadening of the resonance will be the main effect . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the account of this effect can also essentially influence the predictions of qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is useful to perform independent calculations for the real part of the @xmath1 forward scattering amplitude which can also be used at low momenta .    whereas the @xmath0 -meson spectral",
    "function in the nuclear medium has been evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite in dynamical models by considering its @xmath43 decay mode and taking into account the rescattering of pions on nucleons in the medium , we here address an approach based on dispersion relations using experimental information on the vacuum scattering amplitude as input as well as on the @xmath22 couplings ( cf .",
    "another important point is that eqs .",
    "( [ dgamma ] ) and ( [ dmstar ] ) for the collisional broadening and mass shift are valid only at low densities when the resonance - nucleon scattering amplitude inside the nucleus is the same as in the vacuum . a discussion of this point will be presented in section  3.2 explicitly .",
    "within the framework of the vector dominance model ( vdm ) the compton scattering amplitude can be expressed through the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 scattering amplitudes as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the invariant amplitude for the elastic scattering of the transverse polarized vector meson on the nucleon , @xmath49 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath50 is the invariant compton scattering amplitude and @xmath51=0.55  @xcite . according to experimental data ( cf .",

    "we note , however , that the experimental compton scattering amplitude also contains contributions from the continuum of @xmath43 and @xmath53 intermediate states at high energy such that eq .",
    "( [ coupl ] ) appears questionable . here",
    "we will adopt the experimental results on @xmath0-photoproduction instead which are more closely related to the @xmath0-meson itself ( cf .",

    "furthermore , the real part of the forward @xmath1 scattering amplitude is related to its imaginary part through the dispersion relation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a substraction point and @xmath61 is the threshold energy .",
    "the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath62 , furthermore , is related to the total cross section by the optical theorem , @xmath63 thus the knowledge of the total cross section @xmath64 is sufficient to determine @xmath65 through the dispersion relation  ( [ dis1 ] ) once the amplitude is known experimentally at the subtraction point @xmath66 .      within the vdm",
    "one can express the @xmath1 scattering amplitude not only through the compton scattering amplitude ( eq .",
    "( [ coupl ] ) ) but also through the amplitude for @xmath0- photoproduction as : @xmath67 furthermore , the @xmath1 total cross section can be related to the differential cross section of the reaction @xmath68 as @xmath69 here @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the c.m .",
    "momenta of the @xmath72 and @xmath1 systems at the same invariant collision energy @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the ratio @xmath74 of the real to imaginary part of the @xmath1 forward scattering amplitude is small .",
    "this assumption is valid at least for energies above 3  gev  @xcite . thus using the @xmath0 photoproduction data from refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath1 scattering amplitude is fixed at high energy .",
    "we note that at higher energies one can calculate the total cross section of the @xmath1 interaction also within the quark model ( qm ) , where @xmath75 can be expressed in terms of pion - nucleon cross sections as @xmath76 while the @xmath77 cross sections can be taken from a regge fit to the experimental data  @xcite . though the additive quark model at first sight appears questionable for goldstone bosons as the pions , the cross section @xmath75 will turn out practically the same as in the vdm for @xmath0-meson momenta above 2 gev / c ( see below ) .",
    "if the vdm would be valid at all energies we could calculate the mass shift and collisional broadening of the @xmath0 meson in nuclear matter at low densities by inserting eq .",
    "( [ gamrho ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ rmassa ] ) and ( [ rwidtha ] ) from sect .",
    "2 . however , the vdm is expected to hold only at high energies @xmath78  gev  @xcite since at lower energies ( @xmath79 1 - 1.5 gev ) there are a lot of baryonic resonances which couple strongly to the transverse as well as to the longitudinal @xmath80-mesons  @xcite .",
    "therefore at low energies it is necessary to describe the @xmath1 interaction within the framework of a resonance model  @xcite . in the following we consider the @xmath1 forward scattering amplitude being averaged over the @xmath81-meson transverse and longitudinal polarizations .",
    "experimental information on the baryonic resonances and their coupling to the @xmath0-meson is available for masses below 2 gev .",

    "we note that the vdm should be valid at the energy of 4.46 gev such that the subtraction point is no hidden parameter in our approach .",

    "note that the dip for @xmath118  gev / c is due to our interpolation between the low and the high energy regions and thus an artefact of our model which should be discarded .",
    "we also have to mention that the magnitude of the @xmath81-meson momentum , where the real part of the forward @xmath1 scattering amplitude changes its sign , depends on the prescription for the transition between the resonance and high energy part of the total cross section , which is actually model dependent , and estimate this uncertainty as @xmath119  mev / c .",
    "in the low density approximation one now can express the correction of the @xmath0-meson mass and width at finite nuclear density @xmath22 through @xmath114 using eqs .",
    "( [ rmassa ] ) and ( [ rwidtha ] ) .",

    "[ lk2 ] also shows the recent result from hatsuda  @xcite calculated within the qcd sumrule approach at @xmath123 by the full dot .",
    "our result for @xmath124 in the low density approximation is in agreement with this calculation for @xmath116 0 .",
    "note that the qcd sumrule analysis is also limited to low nuclear densities due to the unknown behaviour of the quark 4-point condensates in the medium . at high momenta",
    "@xmath125 2 gev / c our result is also in qualitative agreement with the vdm predictions for the mass shift as found by eletsky and ioffe  @xcite . in their case",
    "the @xmath0 mass shift increases from 60  mev at @xmath126  gev / c to 90  mev at 7  gev / c , whereas our analysis gives a shift of @xmath12770  mev at 2  gev / c and @xmath127120  mev at 7  gev / c .",
    "the deviations with the results from  @xcite are due to the use of the @xmath0-photoproduction amplitudes ( [ vector ] ) instead of the compton scattering amplitude ( [ coupl ] ) used by the latter authors .",
    "thus , if the low density approximation could be extrapolated up to @xmath5 , our model would demonstrate that the repulsive interaction of the @xmath0-meson at high momenta might be consistent with an attractive @xmath1 interaction at low energies .",
    "however , as it was shown ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the finite @xmath0 width can essentially influence the predictions of qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent microscopic calculations of the @xmath0-spectral function at low energies do not show any substantial attraction for slow @xmath0-mesons at normal nuclear density  @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to check if the results obtained within the low density approximation are still valid at normal nuclear density @xmath5 . up to now in calculating the mass shift and broadening of the width for the @xmath0-meson ( shown in fig .",
    "[ lk2 ] ) we have used the vacuum @xmath1 scattering amplitude with resonance contributions which , however , might be different in nuclear matter . an indication for a possible strong medium - modification of baryonic resonances is the experimental observation that the total photoabsorption cross section in nuclei for @xmath128 does not show any resonant structure except the @xmath129 isobar  @xcite . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite this might be explained by a strong in - medium broadering of the @xmath130 resonance ( @xmath131  mev compared to the vacuum width @xmath132  mev ) , but not by conventional medium effects like fermi motion or pauli blocking .",
    "while a collision broadering of this order is hard to justify , it might arise from the strong coupling of the @xmath133 resonance to the @xmath1 channel and a medium modification of the @xmath81-meson  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that such a mechanism can lead to an in - medium width of the @xmath130 resonance of about 350  mev .    to estimate how the latter effect influences our results",
    "we have performed also calculations for the in - medium @xmath1 total cross section by assuming that at normal nuclear density the widths of all resonances - coupled to the @xmath1 channel - are twice as in the vacuum , but their @xmath1 branching ratios stay the same .",
    "this in - medium @xmath1 cross section then was used in the dispersion relation for the calculation of the in - medium real part of the @xmath1 forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ lk13 ] for the total @xmath108 cross section and the real part of the forward scattering amplitude calculated with different widths of all baryonic resonances .",
    "the factor @xmath134 in fig .",
    "[ lk13 ] stands for the ratio of the in - medium width of the baryonic resonance to its value in free space .",
    "we see that the higher order resonance broadening effects have a strong influence on the @xmath1 scattering amplitude in the resonance region .",
    "the total cross section becomes smoother at low energy and as a result the real part of @xmath135 does not change sign anymore with decreasing @xmath136 . at small @xmath136",
    "it remains negative , which means that the main medium effect for the @xmath0-meson at normal nuclear density is the collisional broadening ; the mass shift is slightly repulsive .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with recent calculations of the @xmath0-meson spectral function at low energies from refs .",
    "@xcite . however , a note of caution has to be added here because the predictions within the resonance model are only of qualitative nature .",
    "the properties of nuclear resonances as well as their branching to the @xmath0 channel in the dense medium are unknown so far .",
    "furthermore , the influence of exchange - current corrections at high density on the @xmath0 meson properties should be considered as well .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the momentum dependence of the @xmath0-meson selfenergy ( or in - medium properties ) based on the dispersion relation  ( [ dis1 ] ) for the @xmath1 scattering amplitude at finite ( but small ) nuclear density .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath3 is calculated via the optical theorem  ( [ optic ] ) while the total @xmath1 cross section is obtained within the vdm at high energy and within the resonance model at low energy .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath3 thus is entirely based on experimental data .",
    "our numerical results indicate a sizeable broadening of the @xmath0-meson width in the medium especially for low relative momenta @xmath136 . in the low density approximation the real part of its selfenergy",
    "is found to be attractive for @xmath137  mev / c and to change its sign , becoming repulsive at higher momenta in line with the prediction by eletsky and joffe  @xcite . extrapolating the low density approximation to nuclear saturation density",
    "we obtain a dropping of the @xmath0-mass at @xmath116 0 in line with the qcd sumrule analysis of hatsuda  @xcite .",
    "thus our dispersion approach demonstrates that the results of refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite do not contradict each other due to the rather strong momentum dependence of the @xmath1 scattering amplitude .",
    "however , the resonance part of the @xmath1 scattering amplitude is also influenced by the nuclear medium at saturation density such that the moderate attraction at @xmath1380 changes to a small repulsion .",
    "this behaviour of the @xmath0-meson selfenergy is in qualitative agreement with the recent microscopic calculations of rapp , chanfray and wambach  @xcite as well as klingl et al .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 spectral function . in the latter case",
    "the @xmath0-meson essentially broadens significantly in the dense medium which implies lifetimes of the @xmath0-meson less than 1 fm / c already at density @xmath5 ; in simple words : according to our dispersion approach the @xmath0-meson melts at high nuclear density and does not drop in mass as suggested by the scaling hypothesis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we , finally , note that the explicit momentum dependence of the @xmath0-meson selfenergy is also an important issue that has to be incorporated e.g. in transport theories that attempt to extract information on the @xmath0 spectral function in comparison to experimental dilepton data .",

    "<S> our numerical results indicate a sizeable broadening of the @xmath0-meson width in the medium especially for low relative momenta @xmath4 while the real part of the @xmath0 selfenergy is found to change its sign and to become repulsive already at momenta above 100 mev / c . extrapolating to nuclear saturation density @xmath5 we find a dropping of the @xmath0-mass for @xmath6 0 roughly in line with the qcd sumrule analysis of hatsuda while at high energy an increase of the @xmath0-mass close to the prediction by eletsky and joffe is obtained . however , when including a broadening of the baryonic resonances in the medium , the @xmath0-meson mass shift at @xmath6 0 becomes slightly repulsive whereas the width increases substantially .    </S>",
