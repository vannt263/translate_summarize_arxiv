    "_ rigid body motion registration _ ( rbmr ) is one of the fundamental problems in machine vision and robotics . given a dynamic scene that contains a ( dominant ) rigid body object and a cluttered background , certain salient image feature points can be extracted and tracked with considerable accuracy across multiple image frames @xcite .",
    "the task of rbmr then involves identifying the image features that are associated only with the rigid - body object in the foreground and subsequently recovering its rigid - body transformation across multiple frames .",
    "traditionally , rbmr has been mainly conducted in 2-d image space , with the assumption of the camera projection model from simple orthographic projection @xcite to more realistic camera models such as paraperspective @xcite and affine @xcite . in problems such as rbmr , structure from motion ( sfm ) , and motion segmentation @xcite",
    ", a fundamental observation is that a data matrix that contains the coordinates of tracked image features in column form can be factorized as a camera matrix that represents the motion and a shape matrix that represents the shape of the rigid body in the world coordinates .",
    "furthermore , if the data are noise - free , then the feature vectors in the data matrix lie in a 4-d subspace , as the rank of the shape matrix in the world coordinates is at most four @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "the rbmr problem can become more challenging if the tracked image features are perturbed by moderate noise , gross image corruption ( e.g. , when the features are occluded ) , and missing data ( e.g. , when the features leave the field of view ) . in robust statistics",
    ", it is well known that the optimal solution to recover a subspace model when the data is complete yet affected by gaussian noise is _ singular value decomposition _ ( svd ) .",
    "solving other image nuisances caused by gross measurement error corresponds to the problem of robust estimation of a low - dimensional subspace model in the presence of corruption and missing data . in @xcite , for instance , the issue of missing data was addressed by robustifying svd via power factorization . in @xcite ,",
    "the same issue was addressed by an iterative imputation strategy .    in the case of outlier rejection , arguably",
    "the most popular robust model estimation algorithm in computer vision is random sample consensus ( ransac ) @xcite . in the context of rbmr ,",
    "the standard procedure of ransac is to apply the iterative _ hypothesize - and - verify _ scheme on a frame - by - frame basis to recover rigid - body motion @xcite . in the context of dimensionality reduction , ransac can also be applied to recover low - dimensional subspace models @xcite , such as the above shape model in motion registration .",
    "nevertheless , the aforementioned solutions have two major drawbacks . in the case of missing data",
    ", methods such as power factorization or incremental svd can not guarantee the global convergence of the estimate @xcite . in the case of outlier rejection",
    ", the ransac procedure is known to be expensive to deploy in a real - time , online fashion , such as in the solutions for _ simultaneous localization and mapping _ ( slam ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , a better solution than the state of the art should provide provable global optimality to compensate missing data , image corruption , and erroneous feature tracks , and at the same time should be more efficient to recover rigid body motion from a video sequence in a online fashion . in this paper",
    ", we propose a highly robust solution to address this problem .",
    "our solution is motivated by the emerging theory of robust pca ( rpca ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , rpca provides a unified solution to estimating low - rank matrices in the cases of both missing data _ and _ random data corruption @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum if the ambient space dimension is sufficiently high .",
    "compared to other existing solutions such as incremental svd and ransac , the set of heuristic parameters one needs to tune is also minimal .",
    "furthermore , recent progress in convex optimization has led to very efficient numerical implementation of rpca with the computational complexity comparable to that of classical svd @xcite .",
    "our proposed solution to online 3-d motion registration consists of two steps . in the initialization step",
    ", rpca is used to estimate a low - rank representation of the rigid - body motion within the first several image frames , which establishes a global shape model of the rigid body . in the online update step ,",
    "we propose a sparse subspace projection method that projects new observations onto the low - dimensional shape model , simultaneously correcting possible sparse data corruption .",
    "the overall algorithm is called _ sparse online low - rank projection and outlier rejection _ ( ) .",
    "compared to the popular method of ransac , one major benefit of the new solution is that by enforcing a low - rank shape model , those sparsely corrupted image features can be compensated instead of simply being discarded . in this paper , we apply the algorithm to 3-d motion features that are tracked by the relatively new microsoft kinect motion sensor .",
    "however , the same algorithm can help address the more traditional rbmr problems with 2-d image features . through extensive simulation and a real - world experiment ,",
    "we demonstrate that solo solves the online rbmr problem with state - of - the - art accuracy and more importantly improved speed of one or two orders of magnitude faster than ransac .",
    "to aid peer evaluation , the matlab / c source code of our algorithm will be released on our website .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the 3-d feature tracking methodology used in this paper . in our 3-d tracking subsystem ( e.g. , on microsoft kinect ) , we first identify salient image features , and then track them frame by frame in image space ( as an example shown in figure [ fig : tracker ] ) .",
    "the features are then reprojected onto the camera coordinate system using depth measurements . over time , new features are extracted on periodic intervals to maintain a dense set over the image geometry .",
    "each feature is tracked independently , and may be dropped once it leaves the field of view or produces spurious results ( jumps ) in camera space .        for tracking",
    ", we use the kanade - lucas - tomasi feature tracker ( klt ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the klt tracker is extremely fast and can run in real time on a standard desktop computer . for klt to work effectively , the extracted features must exhibit local saliency . to achieve this and produce a dense set of features over scenes , we use the harris corner detector as well as a difference of gaussians ( dog ) extractor @xcite . only the lowest two levels of the dog pyramid",
    "this ensures that the features exhibit high local saliency in a small window and are spatially well - localized .",
    "one implicit advantage of tracking features across multiple frames is that it permits the tracking data to be represented naturally as a matrix .",
    "each ( sample - indexed ) row represents observations of multiple features in a single time step , while each column represents the observations of each feature over all frames .",
    "overall , the tracking system we employ demonstrates that simple , efficient algorithms can track well - localized feature trajectories over multiple frames .",
    "together with the registration algorithm described in section [ sec : reg ] , our complete system could be deployed in low - cost embedded devices .    as a point of comparison ,",
    "many existing slam front - ends employ feature extraction and matching on a frame - by - frame basis @xcite .",
    "this technique works quite well because ransac rejects misaligned features .",
    "however , they are subject to two major drawbacks .",
    "first , real time applications of extract - and - match techniques require hardware acceleration to run in real time .",
    "second , they match features between frames in feature space , neglecting continuity of spatial observations of these features .",
    "first , we shall formulate the 3-d rbmr problem and introduce the notation we will use for the rest of the paper .",
    "we denote @xmath0 as the coordinates of feature @xmath1 in the @xmath2th frame , where @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] . in the noise - free case , when the same @xmath1th feature is observed in two different frames @xmath5 and @xmath2 ,",
    "its images satisfy a rigid - body constraint : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a rotation matrix and @xmath8 is a 3-d translation .",
    "this relation can be also written in homogeneous coordinates as @xmath9 \\left [ \\begin{matrix}\\xx_{1,j}\\\\ 1 \\end{matrix}\\right ] \\doteq \\pi g_i \\left [ \\begin{matrix}\\xx_{1,j}\\\\ 1 \\end{matrix}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath10\\in{{\\mathbb{r}}}^{3\\times 4}$ ] is a projection matrix .    in the noise - free case , since all the features in the @xmath2th frame satisfy the same rigid - body motion , one can stack the image coordinates of the same feature in the @xmath11 frames in a long vector form , and then the collection of all the @xmath12 features form a data matrix @xmath13 , which can be written as the product of two rank-4 matrices : @xmath14 = \\left [ \\begin{smallmatrix } \\pi g_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\",
    "\\pi g_f \\end{smallmatrix}\\right ] \\left [ \\begin{smallmatrix}\\xx_{1,1 } , & \\cdots , & \\xx_{1,m } \\\\ 1 , & \\cdots , & 1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right ] \\in { { \\mathbb{r}}}^{3f\\times m}. \\label{eq : rank-4}\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath15 represents the identity matrix .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that when @xmath16 , the rank of matrix @xmath13 that represents a rigid - body motion in space is at most four , which is upper bounded by the rank of its two factor matrices in . in sfm , the first matrix on the right hand side of",
    "is called a _ motion matrix _ @xmath17 , while the second matrix is called a _ shape matrix _ @xmath18 .",
    "although is not a unique rank-4 factorization of @xmath13 , a canonical representation can be determined by imposing additional constraints on the shape of the object @xcite .",
    "lastly , for motion registration , if we denote the 3-d coordinates ( e.g. , under the world coordinates centered at the camera ) of the first frame as : @xmath19 \\in { { \\mathbb{r}}}^{3\\times m}$ ] , then the rigid body motion @xmath20 of the features from the world coordinates to any @xmath2th frame satisfies the following constraint : @xmath21 = r_i w_1 + t_i\\one^t .",
    "\\label{eq : registration}\\ ] ] using , the two transformations @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be recovered by the orthogonal procrustes ( op ) method @xcite .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath24 be the mean vector of @xmath25 , and denote @xmath26 as the centered feature coordinates after the mean is subtracted .",
    "suppose the svd of @xmath27 gives rise to : @xmath28 then the rotation matrix @xmath29 , and the translation @xmath30 .",
    "in this work , we consider an online solution to rbmr .",
    "our goal is to maintain the estimation of a low - rank representation of @xmath13 and its subsequent new observations @xmath25 with minimal computational complexity . in the rest of the section ,",
    "we first discuss the initialization step to jump start the low - rank estimation of the initial observations @xmath13 in section [ sec : initialization ] .",
    "then we propose our solution to update the low - rank estimation in the presence of new observations in @xmath2th frame @xmath25 in section [ sec : online ] . finally , applying",
    "our algorithm on real - world data may encounter additional nuisances such as new feature tracks entering the scene and missing data .",
    "after the summary of algorithm [ alg ] , we will briefly show that the proposed solution can be easily extended to handle these additional conditions in an elegant way .      in the initialization step , a robust low - rank representation of",
    "@xmath13 needs to be obtained in the presence of moderate gaussian noise , data corruption , and outlying image features .",
    "the problem can be solved _ in closed form _ by robust pca @xcite . here",
    "we model @xmath31 as the sum of three components : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a rank-4 matrix that models the ground - truth distribution of the inlying rigid - body motion , @xmath34 is a gaussian noise matrix that models the dense noise independently distributed on the @xmath13 entries , and @xmath35 is a sparse error matrix that collects those nonzero coefficients at a sparse support set of corrupted data , outlying image features and bad tracks .",
    "the matrix decomposition in can be successfully solved by a _ principal component pursuit _ ( pcp ) program : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes matrix nuclear norm , @xmath38 denotes entry - wise @xmath39-norm for both matrices and vectors , and @xmath40 is a regularization parameter that can be fixed as @xmath41 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that when the dimension of matrix @xmath13 is sufficiently high and with some extra mild conditions on the coefficients of @xmath33 and @xmath35 , with overwhelming probability , the global ( approximate ) solution of @xmath33 and @xmath35 can be recovered .",
    "the key characteristics of the pcp algorithm are highlighted as follows : firstly , the regularization parameter @xmath40 does not necessarily rely on the level of corruption in @xmath35 , so long as their occurrences are bounded . secondly , although the theory assumes the sparse error should be randomly distributed in @xmath13 , the algorithm itself is surprisingly robust to both sparse random corruption and highly correlated outlying features as a small number of column vectors in @xmath13 . finally , although the original implementation of pcp in @xcite is computationally intractable for real - time applications , its most recent implementation based on an augmented lagrangian method ( alm ) has significantly reduced its complexity @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the alm solver for robust pca , whose average run time is merely a small constant ( in general smaller than 20 ) times the run time of svd . in our online formulation of solo , this calculation only needs to be performed once in the initialization step .",
    "since the resulting low - rank matrix @xmath42 may still contain entries of outlying features , an extra step needs to be taken to remove those outliers .",
    "in particular , one can calculate the @xmath43-norm of each column in @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "with respect to an outlier threshold @xmath45 , if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 represents dense corruption on the corresponding feature track and hence should be regarded as an outlier . with small nonzero values",
    ", a hard - thresholding can be applied to reduce the values to zero .",
    "] subsequently , the indices of the inliers define a support set @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "hence , we denote the cleaned low - rank data matrix after outlier rejection as @xmath49    finally , we note that although in , @xmath42 represents the optimal matrix solution with the lowest possible rank , due to additive noise and data corruption in the measurements , its rank may not necessarily be less than five . therefore , to enforce the rank constraint in the rbmr problem and further obtain a representative of the shape matrices that span the 4-d subspace , an svd is performed on @xmath50 to identify its right eigenspace : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is then a representative of the rigid body s shape matrices .      in this section ,",
    "we propose a novel algorithm that projects new observations @xmath25 from the @xmath2th frame onto the rigid - body shape subspace .",
    "this subspace is parameterized by the shape matrix @xmath53 that we have estimated in the initialization step .",
    "to also represent the 4-d subspace .",
    "] traditionally , a ( least squares ) subspace projection operator would project a ( noisy ) sample perpendicular to the surface of the subspace that it is close to , which only involves basic matrix - vector multiplication .",
    "however , in anticipation of continual random feature corruption during the course of feature tracking for rbmr , the projection must also be robust to sparse error corruption in @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we contend that is a more appropriate yet still efficient algorithm to achieve online motion registration update .",
    "given the initialization @xmath50 and the inlier support set @xmath54 , without loss of generality , we assume @xmath25 only contains those features in the support set @xmath54 . as discussed in and , matrix @xmath53 from the svd of @xmath50 is a representative of the class of all the shape matrices of the rigid body up to an ambiguity of 4-d rotation on the subspace .",
    "therefore , the new observations @xmath25 of the same features should also lie on the same shape subspace .",
    "that is , let @xmath55 $ ] , where each @xmath56 is a row vector .",
    "then @xmath57    in the presence of sparse corruption , the row vector @xmath58 is perturbed by a sparse vector @xmath59 : @xmath60 the sparse projection constraint bears resemblance to _ basis - pursuit denoising _ ( bpdn ) in compressive sensing literature @xcite , as a sparse error perturbs a high - dimensional sample away from a low - dimensional subspace model .",
    "the standard procedure of bpdn using @xmath39-minimization ( @xmath39-min ) is illustrated in figure [ fig : bpdn ] .",
    "-minimization.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    however , we notice that a bpdn - type solution via @xmath39-min may not be the optimal solution to our problem .",
    "the reason is that the row vectors in @xmath61 $ ] are not three arbitrary vectors in the 4-d subspace @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , the three vectors must be projected onto a nonlinear manifold @xmath17 embedded in the shape subspace @xmath53 , and the span of the shape model can be interpreted as the linear hull of the feasible rigid - motion motions between @xmath62 and @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : subspace - projection ] illustrates this rigid - body constraint applied to sparse subspace projection in 3-d .     should be projected onto a manifold in @xmath53 that represents a valid rigid - body motion.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    our algorithm of _ sparse shape subspace projection _ is described as follows .",
    "given the observation @xmath25 and a shape subspace @xmath53 , the algorithm minimizes : @xmath63 by virtue of low dimensionality of this hull , together with the sparsity of the residual , the projected data @xmath64 should be well localized on the manifold .",
    "hence , in addition to being consistent with a realistic ( sparse ) noise model , the new sparse subspace projection algorithm also implies the benefit of good localization in the motion space .",
    "the objective can be solved quite efficiently ( and much faster than solving rpca in the initialization ) by the same augmented lagrangian approach in @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a matrix of lagrange multipliers , and @xmath67 represents a monotonically increasing penalty parameter during the optimization .",
    "the optimization only involves a soft - thresholding function applied to the entries of @xmath68 and matrix - matrix multiplication for the update of @xmath69 and @xmath68 , and does not involve computation of singular values as in rpca .    finally , the rigid - body motion between each @xmath25 and the first reference frame @xmath62 after the projection can be recovered by the op algorithm .",
    "however , as the projection may be also affected by dense gaussian noise , the estimated low - rank component may not accurately represent a consistent rigid - body motion . as a result",
    ", what we can do is to identify an index set @xmath70 for those uncorrupted features with zero coefficients in @xmath68 .",
    "the op algorithm will be applied only using the uncorrupted _ original _ features in @xmath62 and @xmath25 . in a sense",
    ", this motion registration algorithm resembles the strategy in ransac to select inlying sample sets .",
    "however , our algorithm has the ability to directly identify the corrupted features via sparse subspace projection , and hence the process is noniterative and more efficient .",
    "the complete algorithm , _ sparse online low - rank projection and outlier rejection _ ( solo ) , is summarized in algorithm [ alg ] .",
    "* input : * initial observations @xmath13 , feature coordinates of the reference frame @xmath62 , and @xmath25 for each subsequent frame @xmath2 .",

    "@xmath71 , remove outliers in the reference frame .",
    "@xmath72 = \\mbox{svds}(l^{(i ) } , 4)$ ] .",
    "identify corruption @xmath68 via sparse subspace projection .",
    "let @xmath70 be the index set of uncorrupted features in @xmath25 .",
    "estimate @xmath20 using inlying samples in @xmath74 .",
    "* output : * inlier support set @xmath54 , rigid - body motions @xmath20 .    before we proceed to discuss results from our experiment ,",
    "it is worth mentioning a straightforward yet elegant extension of the algorithm in the presence of missing data . in the initialization step",
    ", one can rely on a variant of rpca to recover the missing data in matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the technique is known as _ low - rank matrix completion _",
    "@xcite , which minimizes a similar low - rank representation objective constrained on the observable coefficients : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an index set of those features that remain visible in @xmath13 , and @xmath77 is the orthogonal projection onto the linear space of matrices supported on @xmath76 .",
    "using low - rank matrix completion , in the presence of a partial measurement of new feature tracks , those incomplete new observations should be identified as tracks with missing data . then a new initialization step using should be performed on a new data matrix @xmath13 that includes the new tracks to re - establish the shape subspace and inlier support set @xmath54 as in .",
    "in this section , we validate the performance of solo algorithm and compare with the classical ransac solutions , which has been the most popular solution to date for slam and motion registration . in the rest of the section , the two algorithms will be applied to a thorough list of simulations and a real - world experiment .",
    "the benchmarks are calculated on a 2ghz pc with an intel core i7 processor and in matlab environment .",
    "we first use synthesized data to benchmark the accuracy and speed of our batch motion registration algorithm described in section [ sec : initialization ] .",
    "the calculation of @xmath20 between each pair of @xmath62 and @xmath25 will be based on @xmath50 alone as the output of rpca and outlier rejection .",
    "we compare the performance of motion registration by rpca with that by the classical solution of ransac on a frame - by - frame basis .",
    "the minimal feature set in ransac is set to four .    in one simulation ,",
    "the outlier rejection results in motion registration by rpca and ransac are visualized in figure [ fig : simulation ] . in this example",
    ", we observe that rpca is much more effective in identifying both random data corruption and outlying feature tracks ( that post inconsistent feature measurements in the entire columns ) than ransac .",
    "also note that the large coefficient difference in the two columns of figure [ fig : simulation - e ] should not be a concern , as it is well known that rpca can not uniquely recover dense column corruption @xcite , and nevertheless the corresponding features will be rejected as outliers by .",
    "finally , we can also see quite significant difference between the ground - truth low - rank matrix @xmath33 and its estimate @xmath78 .",
    "it shows the accuracy of rpca is still sensitive to high variance dense gaussian noise .",
    "+    to overcome the issue of dense gaussian noise in rpca , our recommended implementation further adds a ransac - style refinement stage , which selects a minimal set of inlying samples from the support set already identified by rpca .",
    "correspondences consistent with the constructed model are merged until the refinement stage converges .",
    "typically this recursive refinement process converges in 24 iterations . with this in mind",
    ", we show the accuracy and speed of motion registration using rpca and ransac in figure [ fig : benchmark ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : noise - accuracy ] the motion registration accuracy with respect to two matrices @xmath79 is measured by the sum of the difference to the ground truth @xmath80 in frobenius norm .",
    "+    we can see in figure [ fig : runtime ] , with certain level of accuracy confidence , the average runtime of ransac grows superlinearly with the increase of the corruption percentage , while rpca remains effective in compensating those corruptions in the low - rank matrix .",
    "figure [ fig : compfeats ] and [ fig : compframes ] show reasonable increase in computation time for rpca with respect to the number of features and the number of frames in the motion window @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the accuracy about the estimated rigid - body transformation is shown in figure [ fig : noise - accuracy ] . without the additional refinement stage ,",
    "rpca already achieves comparable result than ransac .",
    "if the iterative refinement is added to the algorithm , we can see significant improvement in the estimation of the motion .",
    "notice that the estimation errors of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are already very small in all three cases , as shown on the @xmath83-axis .",
    "we now test the performance of the online solo algorithm combined with the klt tracker on a set of real - world depth data collected by a microsoft kinect sensor .",
    "the data are collected in an indoor lab environment .",
    "the motion registration and scene reconstruction results are shown in figure [ fig : experiment ] .",
    "+   +   +   +   +    in our experiment , we found the klt tracking scheme applied on kinect to be highly effective in practice , producing upwards of two hundred tracks in a typical indoor setting .",
    "this ensures that the initialization of @xmath13 has enough features to converge to the correct low - rank model @xmath84 .",
    "as expected , the klt feature tracker also produces small amounts of local jumps due to repetitive object textures ( e.g. , the checkerboard pattern ) .    for this experiment ,",
    "we have tuned ransac specifically for the empirical sample corruption ratio in the scene . despite this effort ,",
    "solo is still faster by a factor of two compared to ransac .",
    "we emphasize that oracle tuning provides a lower bound on the complexity of ransac , and its complexity would be much higher in a less - controlled , online setting .",

    "the red trajectories are those which are selected by solo for rejection . despite spurious recorded behavior , such as coarse spatial discontinuities , many of the tracks are salvageable and properly localized in the cleaned data @xmath84 .",
    "overall , solo demonstrates equally good or better registration quality than ransac , if measured qualitatively .",
    "we have proposed an online 3-d motion registration algorithm called solo .",
