    "stellar limb darkening is the wavelength - dependent decrease in specific intensity , @xmath0 , with decreasing @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the angle between the surface normal and the line of sight ; as a function of a single angle @xmath1 makes the implicit assumption of azimuthal symmetry of the radiation field . ] in the context of model atmospheres , it is , in principle , significantly more sensitive to input physics than are integral quantities , such as the emergent flux .    until rather recently , the only important opportunity to compare models and observations of limb darkening for the distant stars has been through eclipsing - binary systems , but there the comparison has been hindered both by the rather weak dependence on limb darkening of the light - curves , and by degeneracies with other model parameters . as a consequence , normal practice among light - curve analysts",
    "has been to _ assume _ some description of limb darkening , based on stellar - atmosphere results ; any errors in the description are liable to be concealed by small adjustments to fitted free parameters .",
    "new observational techniques have begun to allow the direct investigation of limb darkening ( and hence more sensitive tests of model - atmosphere calculations ) under other circumstances .",
    "optical interferometry has opened the way to direct imaging of stellar surfaces beyond the solar system for a handful of stars with the largest angular diameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and microlensing light - curves are also capable of probing the intensity distribution of the lensed source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , albeit usually only crudely @xcite . however , the focus of the present paper is on the role of limb darkening in exoplanetary transits , which are likely to yield many more results in the coming years than any other technique .    in many respects ,",
    "star+exoplanet systems are close to being idealised eclipsing binaries : it is often reasonable to assume that the photometric properties of the parent star are unaffected by the transiting planet ( i.e. , no tidal distortion , ` reflection ' effect , or gravity darkening ) , and that the secondary ( planet ) is completely dark , and spherical .",
    "these assumptions reduce the number of geometric unknowns to be determined from the light - curve to only three ( in addition to the orbital ephemeris , which may be established separately ) ; e.g. , the ratio of the radii , the size of the star in units of the centres - of - mass separation , and the impact parameter .",
    "this relative simplicity allows a more critical examination of limb darkening than is possible in star+star systems . with an anticipated torrent of data of extremely high quality from satellites such as _ kepler _",
    ", it is therefore timely to revisit the comparison of limb - darkening coefficients ( ldcs ) from model - atmosphere and light - curve analyses , as has already been recognized by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this comparison is examined here as follows : section  [ sec : cld ] reviews limb - darkening ` laws ' and fitting techniques ( including a new flux - conserving least - squares methodology ) , stressing the spread in numerical coefficients that can arise even when characterizing a given model - atmosphere intensity distribution with a given law .",
    "section  [ sec : exox ] examines the ldcs extracted from light - curve analyses , emphasizing not only the range in numerical coefficients that can arise from characterizing a given surface - brightness distribution under different geometries , but also that the photometrically determined ldcs are not , in any case , directly comparable to those derived from model - atmosphere calculations .    with the background that ( i ) the numerical values of coefficients determined from model atmospheres depend on the fitting method , and ( ii ) coefficients determined from light - curves are not directly comparable to model - atmosphere resulst , and vary with impact parameter , section  [ sec : lfl ] outlines how model - atmosphere limb - darkening results _ can _ be compared with inferences from high - quality exotransit photometry , and presents illustrative results .",
    "in photometric analyses , it is still impractical to invert observed light - curves in order to recover detailed stellar surface - brightness distributions .",
    "rather , in this context limb darkening is habitually represented by some _",
    "ad hoc _ ` law ' with one or , at most , two free parameters , which may be optimized as part of the fitting process .. ] in order to facilitate comparison of light - curve results with model - atmosphere calculations , model intensities are often represented with the same parametrizations .      historically , the first limb - darkening law to be developed was the analytical solution for an atmosphere in which the source function is linear in optical depth : @xmath4 \\label{eq:01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite , where the wavelength dependence of @xmath5 is implicit ( although @xmath6 at all wavelengths for a grey atmosphere ; @xcite ) .",
    "this linear law is the universally adopted one - parameter representation of limb darkening .",
    "more - realistic atmosphere models do not have analytical functional representations of actual limb darkening . following",
    "the work of @xcite , a quadratic law of the form @xmath7 \\label{eq:02}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has been widely adopted as a characterization of model - atmosphere calculations .",
    "it is of particular importance in modelling exotransit photometry using monte - carlo markov - chain ( mcmc ) techniques , since it allows for analytical calculation of light - curves with good computational efficiency @xcite .    while eqtns .",
    "[ eq:01 ] and [ eq:02 ] are convenient in the analysis of light - curves , a significantly more accurate representation of model - atmosphere results is achieved with the four - coefficient fit introduced by @xcite : @xmath8 . \\label{eq:03}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form reproduces intensities from model atmospheres to @xmath91 part in 1000 over a wide range of parameter space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is nt practical to estimate numerical values of the coefficients from photometry .",
    "although linear and quadratic limb - darkening laws may not give particularly accurate functional descriptions of model - atmosphere intensities , it is nonetheless necessary to represent them in this way in order to compare with observationally derived ldcs .",

    "the integration of eqtn .",
    "[ eq : flux ] using an analytical limb - darkening law to represent @xmath23 , with coefficients determined by least squares , will not normally recover the physical flux exactly . to address this",

    "requiring @xmath25 , evaluated from the limb - darkening law , to equal @xmath23 , evaluated from the model atmosphere , at some arbitrary @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath27 for the linear law .",
    "@xcite chose @xmath28 , whence @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( noting the @xcite s `` angle - averaged '' [ astrophysical ] flux is @xmath30 in the nomenclature adopted here ) . in effect , the choice of @xmath31 fixes the intercept of the linear law , with the constraint of flux conservation then fixing the slope .",
    "the equivalent algebra for the quadratic law follows from selecting any two values @xmath32 at which @xmath25 is equal to @xmath23 , giving a pair of simultaneous equations that can readily be solved for @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite , and subsequent authors , used @xmath34 ( values which are also adopted here ) , but again these are more or less arbitrary choices .",
    "the weakness of the standard flux - conserving approach is the lack of a compelling physical argument to select any particular @xmath31 values for the normalization ( other than requiring the intensities to be everywhere positive ; e.g. , requiring @xmath35 in the linear case ) . rather than making an arbitrary choice of @xmath31",
    ", we can instead introduce the more objective requirement of minimising the sum of the squares of the differences between model and fitted intensities while still requiring flux to be conserved .",
    "for a linear law it is convenient first to determine @xmath5 by by minimising @xmath36 , using standard least - squares techniques , where @xmath37;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and to then evaluate @xmath38 corresponding results for the quadratic law are @xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath40 not surprisingly , this newly introduced approach of flux - conserving least squares generally yields numerical coefficients very close to those found using the ls2 method . therefore , although it may be regarded as superior to ls2 in principle , in practice it affords no great benefit ( and turns out not to give results particularly close to photometrically inferred ldcs ) .",
    "the foregoing numerical methods can ( and do ) yield substantially different ldc values , even for the standard linear and quadratic representations of a given , fixed , intensity distribution , as is illustrated by figs .",
    "[ fig : rcomp ] and  [ fig : uplot ] . for a given intensity distribution , in the optical wavelength regime",
    "the fc1 @xmath5 coefficient is usually the smallest numerically ; ls2 and fc2 @xmath5 coefficients are very similar , and relatively large ; and the ls1 coefficient is intermediate .",
    "when characterizing model - atmosphere results , the density and distribution of angles at which intensities are calculated , and the weighting scheme , will also influence the numerical values of limb - darkening coefficients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the present work ,",
    "intensities were computed for @xmath41 to 1 at steps of 0.001 , and equally weighted when fitting functional forms .",
    "of course , the physics used in constructing the model atmosphere is also critical .",
    "the limb - darkening coefficients used throughout this paper were computed using the atlas9 line - blanketed lte model - atmosphere code @xcite , as ported to gnu - linux systems by @xcite , with the opacity distribution functions described by @xcite .",
    "solar abundances , a microturbulent velocity of @xmath42  , and mixing - length parameter @xmath43 were adopted unless noted otherwise .",
    "these models use time - independent , plane - parallel structures ; while atmospheric extension is unlikely to be important in the parameter space discussed here , the neglect of time - dependent 3d effects may be significant when comparing with empirical results ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dispersion in coefficient values introduced simply by numerical techniques poses the question : which procedure is most appropriate for comparing model - atmosphere results with observational determinations of limb darkening ? to answer this question",
    "it is necessary first to examine just what it is that is measured from transit observations .",
    "photometric observations of exoplanetary transits record , essentially , the variation of @xmath44 along a chord . in practice",
    ", this variation is parameterized by an analytical limb - darkening law , whose coefficients are optimized as part of the global fitting procedure .",
    "this optimization process is quite different from fitting a limb - darkening law to model - atmosphere intensities , so it is immediately clear that there can not be any simple one - to - one correspondence between photometric and model - atmopshere ldcs .",
    "moreover , the extent to which a transit light - curve encodes the global limb darkening must depend on the impact parameter ; for a circular orbit , where @xmath45 is the orbital semi - major axis and @xmath46 is the orbital inclination ] on how faithfully the chosen parametrization of the limb darkening matches the intensities on those parts of the star that are occulted ; and how well it extrapolates to those parts that are not . given that simple linear and quadratic limb - darkening laws give only approximate representations of actual intensity distributions ,",
    "it might be anticipated that ld coefficients determined from light - curves must , at some level , suffer systematic biasses depending on impact parameter , reinforcing the point that these photometric coefficients must fail to correspond directly to any equivalent , single - valued , characterization of model - atmosphere results .    to demonstrate and quantify these effects ,",
    "model transit light - curves were first generated for a range of stellar temperatures and passbands .",
    "limb darkening was represented in the light - curve calculations by eqtn .",
    "[ eq:03 ] , with coefficients determined by least squares ( i.e. , for practical purposes , the model - atmosphere results were represented almost exactly ) .",
    "the geometry was set by choosing a ratio of planetary to stellar radii of 1:10 and a centres - of - mass separation of 10@xmath47 , representative of ` hot jupiter ' systems commonly observed to transit ( although the subsequent limb - darkening results are insensitive to the adopted values ) , with the impact parameter varied over the range 00.95 .",
    "the resulting light - curves were then solved for basic geometrical parameters , and for linear or quadratic ldcs .",
    "these calculations were performed using a modified version of @xcite , which is itself based on etzel s code @xcite .",
    "proximity effects ( tidal distortion , ` reflection ' , etc . )",
    "were throughout assumed to be negligible .",
    "figure  [ fig : ucomp ] shows a selection of the results , and demonstrates that , in this parameter space , linear ldcs derived from photometry systematically increase with increasing impact parameter , by up to @xmath90.2 ( @xmath960% ) .",
    "this behaviour is straightforward to understand : in the optical regime @xmath48 decreases with increasing @xmath1 , so that any transit that is not central ( i.e. , inclination @xmath49 ) samples a relatively steep part of the limb - darkening law .",
    "a linear approximation to that law must therefore yield a linear limb - darkening coefficient that is , in general , larger than that derived from a central transit .",
    "figure  [ fig : uplot ] illustrates this point by showing model - atmosphere results , and linear approximations , for a 4  kk model .",
    "the intensity in the _ u _ band is very nearly a linear function of @xmath1 , so any characterization will yield similar numerical values for the @xmath5 coefficient .",
    "this is confirmed both in that least - squares and flux - conserving approaches yield similar results in this passband , and in that the @xmath5 coefficient derived photometrically is insensitive to impact parameter ( upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ucomp ] ) .",
    "this contrasts with _",
    "h_-band results ; the intensity there is a strongly non - linear function of angle , and any diagnostic that characterizes only small @xmath1 values must yield a larger @xmath5 coefficient than that characterizing the entire centre - to - limb variation . fig .",
    "[ fig : ucomp ] shows this to be the case .    fig .",
    "[ fig : ucomp ] also shows the linear limb - darkening coefficients obtained by fitting the input intensity distributions directly , using flux - conserving ( fc1 ) and flux - conserving least - squares ( fc2 ) techniques , which bracket the range of numerical values derived directly from the model atmospheres . in this parameter space , these coefficients also almost bracket the corresponding photometric ldcs which suggests a simple , if rough - and - ready , means of comparing observational and model - atmosphere parametrizations .",
    "furthermore , if one had to choose a _ single , _",
    "linear limb - darkening coefficient to compare with photometric results , then the fc1 value is probably the least poor option ; for randomly inclined orbits , smaller impact parameters are more probable than larger ones ( and observational selection effects also favour higher orbital inclinations ) , and photometrically determined limb darkening coefficients are generally closest to the fc1 ldc in this case",
    ".      the variations in linear limb - darkening coefficient are present _ a fortiori _ for the quadratic coefficients , although here the interpretation is less straightforward because of the well - known strong correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , evident in the left - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : qplot ] ( see also fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite point out that this correlation is largely removed through a rotation onto new principal axes , @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "results rotated to these co - ordinates are shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : qplot ] , and confirm that , while the @xmath54 values continue to show a large variation with impact parameter , @xmath55 is more nearly constant .",
    "the correspondence between the photometric and model - atmosphere results is less straightforward than with the linear law ; the model - atmosphere representations of limb darkening show no simple relationship to the photometrically - determined equivalents ( notwithstanding rough quantitative similarities ) .",
    "nevertheless , the small dispersion found for the @xmath55 coefficient in _ both _ observational and model - atmosphere characterizations of limb darkening indicates that this should be the parameter of choice when making comparisons .",
    "the foregoing sections emphasize that different characterizations of model - atmosphere results can give quite different numerical results ( e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : rcomp ] ) ; and that light - curve analyses , using , of necessity , approximate limb - darkening ` laws ' , yield ldcs that vary with transit geometry ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : ucomp ] ) .",
    "furthermore , although a given analytical limb - darkening law is adopted in photometric studies , the determination of its coefficients through light - curve modelling is , numerically , fundamentally distinct from the techniques of fitting model - atmosphere intensity distributions discussed in section  [ sec : cld ] ; that is , comparing photometric and model - atmosphere results is , to an extent , like comparing apples and oranges ( but see @xcite ) . in order to examine the relationship between empirical , photometric ldcs and theoretical model - atmosphere values",
    ", it is therefore necessary to devise a method ensuring a fair comparison .    the most direct way to perform such",
    "a ` like for like ' comparison is to adapt the methods used in section  [ sec : exox ] , i.e. , to generate model light - curves for well - studied systems , using as inputs the empirically determined geometric parameters , coupled to model - atmosphere intensity distributions ( in practice , approximated by eqtn .",
    "[ eq:03 ] ) for the ` known ' stellar parameters .",
    "this synthetic photometry can then be solved for the geometric parameters and ldcs , using the same simplified limb - darkening law adopted in the observational photometric analysis .",

    "it s therefore somewhat surprising that agreement between empirical ldcs and those from the spam approach ( or from direct fitting to model atmospheres ) varies from excellent ( kepler-6 ) to statistically unacceptable ( e.g. , kepler-5 ) .",
    "there is a suggestion that the extent of agreement correlates with temperature ; the spam ldcs for the three coolest stars fall within the cloud of the best - fitting 90%  of solutions , while those for the three hottest lie ( just ) outside .",
    "the trend is for the cloud of empirical values to move towards smaller ( @xmath63 ) values with increasing temperature , compared to the model - atmosphere results .",
    "it s unclear why the empirical results should show so much greater variation than the models , suggesting that this apparent trend may simply be an artefact of the small sample , or that some additional factor plays an unexpectedly important role .",

    "the variation with wavelength of both @xmath50 and @xmath51 coefficients is much less for the spam coefficients than is found empirically .",
    "however , both sequences run almost parallel to the rotated @xmath54 axis , and agreement in the better - determined @xmath55 parameter is tolerable at all wavelengths . to @xmath72 because of the strong correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it should also be noted that the error bars in fig .",

    "this is in contrast to the _ kepler _ results for stars at similar effective temperatures ( but is consistent with the result that it is the higher - gravity stars that show the best agreement between models and observations ) .",
    "different methods of fitting a given limb - darkening law to a given model - atmosphere intensity distribution lead to quite different numerical coefficients .",

    "there is a hint of a possible temperature dependence in the extent of disagreement for these targets , with cooler stars showing better agreement .",
    "however , at similar effective wavelengths hst results for hd  209458 ( which is at the hotter end of the range of _ kepler _ targets ) agree well with models ; there are discrepancies at longer and short wavelengths , though again with fair agreement in @xmath55 . since gravity ( and metallicity )",

    "forthcoming results from _ kepler _ , and other missions , should enlarge the parameter space , and permit better discrimination of where models and observations do and do not agree .",

    "are presented in fig  [ fig : app1 ] .",
    "[ to remind the reader , model light - curves were generated using a ratio of planetary to stellar radii of 1:10 and a centres - of - mass separation of 10@xmath47 , over a range of impact parameters , and an effectively exact representation of limb darkening .",
    "these light - curves were then solved , adopting linear or quadratic limb darkening ( with the ldcs as free parameters ) .",
    "it is the results of these light - curve solutions that are summarized in fig  [ fig : app1 ] . ]",
    "the systematic errors in fitted geometric parameters ( up to @xmath94%in @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the models presented here ) might be significant for the best - quality photometry if a linear limb - darkening law is assumed , but are negligible if a quadratic law is used ."
