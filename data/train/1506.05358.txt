    "<S> additionally , it usually has a _ forward _ nature with a conic geometry known as the cherenkov cone whose axis is oriented _ along _ the _ supersonic _ particle motion . here </S>",
    "<S> we predict cherenkov sound of a unique nature entirely resulting from the electronic _ spin _ degree of freedom and demonstrate a fundamentally distinct cherenkov effect originating from essentially _ subsonic _ electrons in two - dimensional gases with both bychkov - rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that the axis of the conventional _ forward _ cherenkov cone gets a nontrivial _ quarter - turn _ and at the same time the sound distribution strongly localizes around this rotated axis being now _ orthogonal _ to the _ subsonic _ particle motion . apart from its fundamentally appealing nature , the orthogonal cherenkov sound could have applications in planar semiconductor technology combining spin and acoustic phenomena to develop , _ e.g. _ , acoustic amplifiers or sound sources with a flexible spin dependent orientation of the sound propagation .    dating from the idea of a spin transistor @xcite , systems with spin - orbit interactions </S>",
    "<S> have been attracting vasty interest because of a possibility to access the electronic spin degree of freedom by exclusively electric means and currently constitute a considerable part of contemporary spintronics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the orbital and spin degrees of freedom is a relativistic effect and qualitatively it may be understood as a transformation of electric fields into magnetic fields in the rest system of an electron .    in two - dimensional semiconductor heterostructures </S>",
    "<S> two types of spin - orbit interaction are of particular importance . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the dresselhaus @xcite spin - orbit interaction due to the inversion asymmetry of the semiconductor crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is the bychkov - rashba @xcite spin - orbit interaction appearing in asymmetric structures such as , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , asymmetric quantum wells . in realistic systems </S>",
    "<S> both of these spin - orbit interactions are usually present and of comparable strengths which can be measured through , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , shubnikov - de haas oscillations @xcite , photocurrents @xcite , optical monitoring of the spin precession @xcite .    a qualitatively different class of condensed matter systems , where spin - orbit interactions are crucial , is the one of topological insulators @xcite , the phase of matter where metallic edges coexist with an insulating bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of the metallic edges is governed by helical states @xcite . the surface helical states form kramers pairs and the time reversal invariance leads to zero gap ( or metallic ) nature of these states while the states in the bulk are of finite gap ( or insulating ) character . </S>",
    "<S> the surface helical states are intimately linked to the bulk states and the time reversal invariance constrains the number of the dirac points by even numbers .    </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit interaction mechanisms give rise to fascinating physical phenomena such as the intrinsic spin - hall effect @xcite in semiconductors or the quantum spin - hall effect @xcite in topological insulators , persistent spin helix @xcite as an interplay between the bychkov - rashba and dresselhaus mechanisms in semiconductors or spin - transfer torques @xcite in topological insulators with applications to non - volatile memory .    </S>",
    "<S> the examples above spin around the electron dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit physics has , however , another side related to the dynamics of the crystal lattice or phonons . </S>",
    "<S> although the electron - phonon interaction has an orbital nature , the dynamics of the electronic orbital degrees of freedom is strongly affected by the electron spin degree of freedom in systems with spin - orbit interactions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the impact of the electron spin on the phonon dynamics is of fundamental and practical interest . while the impact of phonons on the electron spin dynamics was extensively studied ( _ e.g. _ , dyakonov - perel @xcite mechanism or spin decay in quantum dots @xcite ) , the role of the electron spin in the phonon dynamics was less explored .    </S>",
    "<S> one important aspect of the phonon dynamics is the acoustic cherenkov effect , a counterpart of the optical cherenkov effect @xcite where a medium emits a forward light cone under the action of superlight particles passing through this medium with velocities larger than the medium speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , a medium emits a forward sound cone excited by supersonic particles whose velocity exceeds the medium sound velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of spin - orbit interaction mechanisms changes this picture . in two - dimensional semiconductor heterostructures with the bychkov - rashba spin - orbit interaction supersonic particles </S>",
    "<S> excite sound filling the forward cherenkov cone and also the outward cherenkov cone containing backward or anomalous ( optical anomalous cherenkov effect @xcite exists too but , in contrast to the present case , due to the spatial inhomogeneity ) cherenkov sound @xcite . in other words , the cherenkov cone angle which is , conventionally , between 0 and @xmath0 extends to @xmath1 . on surfaces of three - dimensional topological insulators the cherenkov sound </S>",
    "<S> is excited by helical particles which are always supersonic since the dirac velocity is well above the sound velocity . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the cherenkov sound is also conic with the cherenkov cone angle exceeding @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ , the anomalous cherenkov sound is generated in this case too . </S>",
    "<S> what makes the cherenkov sound in topological insulators distinct is that at high energies it may strongly localize along certain directions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , at low energies a magnetic field control of the cherenkov sound in topological insulators may be of practical interest @xcite .    the arc of vision above might suggests that spin - orbit interaction mechanisms enlarge the cherenkov cone angle but , nevertheless , the very core of the cherenkov physics remains unchanged : 1 ) the cherenkov sound is still excited by supersonic particles ; 2 ) its geometry still represents a single cone ( although , the cone angle may exceed @xmath0 ) ; 3 ) the cone axis is still oriented along the direction of motion of the supersonic particle exciting the cherenkov sound .    in the following we explore the acoustic cherenkov effect in realistic two - dimensional semiconductor heterostructures with both bychkov - rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction mechanisms of comparable strengths and demonstrate that peculiar coupling between the orbital and spin dynamics results in an acoustic cherenkov effect of a unique nature fundamentally different from what has been known so far : 1 ) the cherenkov sound is generated by essentially subsonic electrons ; 2 ) the geometry of the cherenkov sound excited by subsonic electrons represents a double cone ; 3 ) the axis of the cherenkov double cone gets a quarter - turn and , therefore , is orthogonal to the direction of motion of the subsonic particle exciting the cherenkov sound ; 4 ) the cherenkov sound distributed within this rotated cherenkov double cone is strongly localized around the cone axis or , in other words , the cherenkov sound acquires an orthogonal nature .     a qualitative illustration of the orthogonal cherenkov sound in a two - dimensional electron gas with bychkov - rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions . </S>",

    "<S> thus , instead of the normal forward or anomalous backward cherenkov sound excited by supersonic particles within a cone whose axis is parallel to @xmath2 or @xmath10 , the subsonic particles in spin - orbit coupled systems may excite a unique cherenkov sound within a double cone whose axis gets a quarter - turn with respect to @xmath2 or @xmath10 , as shown by multiple phonons ( multiple red wavy arrows ) within the red area indicating the cherenkov double cone.,width=14 ]    a qualitative illustration of the orthogonal cherenkov sound is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> if an incident electron in the upper branch has a momentum @xmath2 ( here and below the subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote initial and final states , respectively ) such that @xmath23 , then , being subsonic at low energies , it will be unable to excite cherenkov sound by virtue of intrachiral ( @xmath24 ) transitions . however , interchiral ( @xmath25 ) transitions with @xmath26 will not generate cherenkov sound either because along these directions the electron energy changes very slowly and , despite the additional energy due to the energy gap between states with opposite chiralities , the electron energy loss is not compatible with its momentum change to emit a phonon . on the other side , interchiral transitions with @xmath27 </S>",

    "<S> we would like to mention that , in addition to its unique fundamental nature described above , the cherenkov sound represents a general and realistic channel of the electron energy dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> usually one assumes that at low energies the conventional cherenkov dissipation is locked out since all particles are subsonic . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis , however , shows that this is not the case in spin - orbit coupled systems and in practice one encounters the problem of energy losses also in the subsonic regime which might be important for phonon - limited low - field electron mobility @xcite being crucial for efficient high clock frequency and low power spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> another practical aspect of the orthogonal cherenkov sound is in diverse combinations of modern spintronics and acoustics to build such devices as acoustic amplifiers @xcite or sources of sound @xcite based on the acoustic cherenkov effect with a flexible control of the sound direction determined by the electron spin dynamics in contrast to the more conventional manipulation mechanisms based on the orbital dynamics .    </S>",
