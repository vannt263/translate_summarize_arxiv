    "single - molecule magnets ( smms ) , such as mn@xmath2 ( see refs . ) and fe@xmath3 ( see refs . ) , have become the focus of intense research since experiments on bulk samples demonstrated the quantum tunneling of a single magnetic moment on a macroscopic scale .",
    "these molecules are characterized by a large total spin , a large magnetic anisotropy barrier , and anisotropy terms which allow the spin to tunnel through the barrier .",
    "electronic transport through smms offers several unique features with potentially large impact on applications such as high - density magnetic storage as well as quantum computing.@xcite recent experiments have pointed out the importance of the interference between spin tunneling paths in molecules . for instance , measurements of the magnetization in bulk fe@xmath3 have observed oscillations in the tunnel splitting @xmath4 between states @xmath5 and @xmath6 as a function of a transverse magnetic field at temperatures between @xmath7 k and @xmath8 k ( see ref . ) .",
    "this effect can be explained by the interference between berry phases associated to spin tunneling paths of opposite windings.@xcite theoretically , a coherent spin - state path integral formulation is used to account for the coherence of the virtual states over which the spin tunnels , although the initial and final spin states do not retain their coherence .    a new approach to the study of smms opened up recently with the first observation of quantized electronic transport through an _ isolated _ mn@xmath2 molecule.@xcite one expects a rich interplay between quantum tunneling , phase coherence , and electronic correlations in the transport properties of smms .",
    "in fact , it has been argued that the kondo effect would only be observable for smms with half - integer spin @xcite and therefore absent for smms such as mn@xmath2 , fe@xmath3 , and ni@xmath1 , where the spin is integer .",
    "later , two of us showed that this is not the case:@xcite remarkably , a transverse magnetic field @xmath9 can be tuned to topologically quench the two lowest levels of a full - integer spin smm , making them degenerate .",
    "in fact , the same berry - phase interference also affects transport for smms with half - integer spin : in that case , sweeping @xmath9 will lead not to one but _ a series _ of kondo resonances . in the case of smms ,",
    "as we show below , the berry phase oscillations of the tunnel splitting @xmath10 of the uncharged single - molecule magnet ( @xmath11 ) for both full- and half - integer spins leads to oscillation of the kondo effect as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "this means that the kondo effect is observable at zero bias for all values of the magnetic field @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "it is interesting to note that at a finite bias the kondo effect in a quantum dot in the presence of a magnetic field can be restored by tuning the bias to @xmath14 ( see ref .  ) . for smms",
    ", however , the interference between the berry phases of the molecule total spin makes the distance between the split kondo peaks , which is equal to @xmath15 , oscillate as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "a necessary condition for observing these oscillations is a large enough tunnel splitting .",
    "recently a new smm based on tetranuclear nickel clusters ni@xmath1 with a @xmath16 ground state has been synthesized .",
    "@xcite our motivation for studying this particular nanomagnet stems partly from its high symmetry @xmath17 but , more importantly , from the large tunnel splittings : @xmath18 k or larger ( depending on the transverse field @xmath9 ) between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 ground states .",
    "recently , some authors have argued that the kondo effect is absent at the diabolic points of the berry - phase interference.@xcite this conclusion came from considering an ad hoc kondo hamiltonian @xcite which was not derived microscopically .",
    "moreover , in recent analysis of the sequential tunneling regime , an ad hoc exchange hamiltonian mixed with an anderson - type hamiltonian was also used without a proper microscopic derivation.@xcite in this paper , we provide a careful microscopic derivation of the kondo hamiltonian suitable for full- and half - integer spin single - molecule magnets by means of a schrieffer - wolff transformation.@xcite by using the exact eigenstates of the positively and negatively charged single - molecule magnet , it is sufficient to apply the schrieffer - wolff transformation to second order in the tunneling matrix element . the resulting kondo exchange parameters exhibit the interference between the second - order transition paths going over the two virtual charged states .",
    "we show that this very same interference phenomenon is also responsible for the berry - phase blockade of the current through the single - molecule magnet in the cotunneling regime , which extends our previous results obtained for the berry - phase blockade in the sequential tunneling regime.@xcite    our derivation of the kondo hamiltonian reveals an important detail : the anderson - type hamiltonian of the single - molecule magnet can be mapped onto a spin-1/2 kondo hamiltonian in two different ways : let @xmath21 be the total spin of the uncharged single - molecule magnet .    1 .",
    "if the total spins @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the ground state of the positively ( @xmath24 ) and negatively ( @xmath25 ) charged single - molecule magnet are equal to @xmath26 , then the kondo hamiltonian exhibits an _ antiferromagnetic exchange coupling _ , which corresponds to the kondo problem for spin 1/2 impurities or spin 1/2 quantum dots . 2 .   if @xmath27 , then the kondo hamiltonian exhibits a _ ferromagnetic exchange coupling _ that leads to a vanishing renormalized transverse exchange coupling ( ising interaction ) , in which case the kondo effect is absent.@xcite    this point is at the very heart of the kondo problem . the kondo effect depends crucially on the selection rules for the addition and subtraction of a spin on the molecule .",
    "this result is in contrast to the kondo effect seen in lateral quantum dots where the exchange coupling is always antiferromagnetic due to fact that spin states are degenerate in the absence of anisotropies.@xcite    in the following , we provide a complete and detailed description of the kondo effect in smms . starting from a microscopic model ( sec .",

    "thus the distance between the two peaks oscillates with the magnetic field , following the renormalized periodic oscillations of the tunnel splitting @xmath231 .",
    "at zero temperature , the current in a single electron transistor can be understood as a sequential process of single electrons tunneling in and out of the left and right electrodes through the smm , where the transport channel is in between the electrochemical potentials of the source and drain reservoir .",
    "the electron transport through the smm is also possible for any off - resonant energy , which is commonly called the cotunneling regime , but it is expected to be very small compared with the sequential tunneling . the cotunneling contribution can be calculated by fermi s golden rule in second - order perturbation theory , i.e. @xmath232 and plays a dominant role whenever the sequential tunneling is suppressed , i.e. @xmath233 .",
    "in contrast to the kondo effect , where the tunnel coupling @xmath234 to the leads is very large , in the cotunneling regime @xmath234 is typically small and thus it is necessary to apply a gate voltage @xmath32 in order to get close to the resonance condition of for example the @xmath25 charged state .",
    "thus we need to take only the electron scattering into account , thereby neglecting the hole scattering contribution . using the incoherent spin states for temperatures around 1 k,@xcite",

    "( [ eqj ] ) we see that the second contribution to fermi s golden rule is a function of the coupling constant , which is to be expected since the schrieffer - wolff transformation is a perturbative approach of the second order .",
    "the advantage of using the schrieffer - wolff transformation is that you can apply the formalism of renormalization theory to get a better description of the physical system near the kondo temperature .",

    "the main contribution of this paper is to show how the total hamiltonian of a single - molecule magnet transistor can be mapped into the kondo hamiltonian by means of a schrieffer - wolff transformation .",
    "while the derivation of the effective kondo hamiltonian in other contexts , such as quantum dots and ordinary single ( nonmagnetic ) molecule coupled to leads is well - known , the case is different for smm .",
    "the dominant kondo effect is unusual for a smm , since it involves a pseudospin of the molecule rather than its total spin .",
    "we show that if the total spin of the molecule is reduced ( increased ) for the charged states , the kondo hamiltonian exhibits an antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) coupling , leading to screening ( anti - screening ) of the total spin of the single - molecule magnet . in the case of antiferromagnetic coupling",
    "the renormalization leads to a kondo effect , i.e. the conductance through the smm exhibits a resonance at the fermi energy . in the case of the ferromagnetic coupling the transverse exchange",
    "is renormalized to zero , in which case the kondo resonance is absent .",
    "this result is in contrast to the case of the kondo effect in lateral quantum dots exhibiting only antiferromagnetic exchange coupling , which is due to the fact that all the spin states are degenerate in the absence of anisotropies.@xcite the standard kondo screening of the molecule magnetization by itinerant electrons in the leads is a very weak effect in this context given the large spin of a smm ( its onset is therefore likely to occur only at exceedingly small temperatures , inaccessible to current experiments ) .",
    "a careful derivation of the effective kondo hamiltonian shows that the strong dependence of this phenomenon on the amplitude and orientation of an external magnetic field .",
    "the strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the smm combined with the weaker in - plane anisotropy creates a pseudo spin 1/2 involving states with opposite magnetization orientation .",
    "a transverse magnetic field modulates the tunnel barrier between these states through a berry phase interference effect .",
    "that , in turn , modulates periodically the kondo effect in smms .    we have calculated the conductance of the single - molecule transistor in the presence of the kondo effect by using the standard poor man s scaling approach .",
    "we have show that in the case of antiferromagnetic kondo exchange coupling by applying a transverse magnetic field to a single - molecule magnet with a large full- or half - integer spin @xmath0 it is possible to topologically induce or quench the kondo effect of the conductance of a current through the single - molecule magnet that is sufficiently well coupled to metallic leads . we have also shown how the zero points of the berry phase oscillation become temperature dependent above the kondo temperature and how they change direction within the plane ( fig . [ bpbt ] ) .",
    "the latter indicates that the parity of the berry - phase oscillations @xcite changes from an integer spin @xmath16 to a half - integer spin @xmath256 . we have also shown how this motion affects the temperature dependence of the conductance ( see fig .",
    "[ conduct ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the maximum value of the conductance encircles the zeros of the berry phase oscillation , providing a mechanism for establishing the location of these zeros when the orientation of the molecule symmetry axis with respect to the metallic contacts is not known .",
    "we illustrate these features of the conductance of a smm using as an example the new single - molecule magnet ni@xmath1 . in our view , due to its large ground state tunnel splitting this is currently the best smm available for the experimental observation of the berry - phase oscillations of the kondo resonance .",
