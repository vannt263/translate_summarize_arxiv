    "several years ago , an interesting observation was made , according to which collision of two particles near the extremal kerr black hole can lead to formally unbounded energy @xmath0 in their center of mass ( cm ) frame @xcite .",
    "later on , it was shown that this phenomenon has a universal character @xcite and is inherent not only to extremal black holes but also to nonextremal ones @xcite .",
    "it is potentially important since it opens new channels of reaction and allows one to probe physics near black holes including processes forbidden in laboratory conditions .",
    "a huge series of works followed .",
    "recently , the emphasis moved from the phenomenon of ultra - high @xmath0 to the question of what can be seen by an observer at infinity , who studies physics in a laboratory .",
    "in particular , the most important issue is whether the energy at infinity @xmath1 can be arbitrarily high as well .",
    "if yes , then the phenomenon under discussion can contribute to the ultra - high energy cosmic rays observed on earth @xcite@xcite .",
    "the question is , however , nontrivial , since strong redshift can `` eat '' a significant part of the energy excess gain in the collision .",
    "thus high @xmath0 does not necessarily imply high energy @xmath1 at infinity .",
    "it turned out that there exist severe restrictions on @xmath1 that make black holes not prospective in this regard @xcite@xcite . on the other hand , systems without the horizon ( in particular , naked singularities )",
    "exhibit the possibility of unbounded @xmath1 . for the first time , this was shown in sec .",
    "vii of @xcite .",
    "quite recently , a work @xcite appeared in which this phenomenon was investigated in detail for the kerr overspun metric .",
    "the results of @xcite were obtained by means of explicit calculations carried out for this metric .    in the present paper ,",
    "we stress that the phenomenon of unbounded @xmath1 has a deep physical underlying reason and can be simply explained in a couple of lines on the basis of the wald inequalities @xcite extended to the collisional process . also , we develop general approach in which we derive the relevant features of collisions without specifying the form of the metric . in the particular case of the kerr metric , our results agree with those of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : wald ] we analyze the wald inequalities and apply them in the context of particle collisions in various scenarios .",
    "section [ sec : frames ] we describe the collision in detail in the center of mass frame , the stationary frame , and the lnrf frame and write out the relations between quantities of interest in them .",
    "in particular , we derive explicit expressions for the killing integrals of motion for the massless fragments in terms of @xmath0 and the escape angles in the center of mass frame .",
    "then we analyze the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "the last section [ sec : infinity ] is devoted to the analysis of particles geodesic motion , in particular to the possibility of the high - energy particles to escape to infinity in a slightly overspinned naked singularity spacetime .",
    "we use the units , in which the fundamental constants are set to unity , @xmath2 .",
    "in this context two related but different concepts of energy are used . the first one is the energy of the colliding particles in their center of mass frame .",
    "it is defined at the event of collision and it determines the collision process , in particular which of the channels of reactions are open and which are not .",
    "second , there are the killing energies of the colliding particles and of the resulting fragments .",
    "the killing energy of a fragment is its energy as measured at infinity .",
    "therefore , it is of crucial interest whether this quantity can be unbounded .",
    "the term `` unbounded '' in this context means that a quantity formally diverges in the limit @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the value of the lapse function at the point of collision .",
    "the particular methods to realize this limit vary for different scenarios and depend on the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "it was obtained in @xcite that the necessary condition for the formally divergent @xmath1 is that @xmath0 should diverge as well ( see their eq .",
    "( 49 ) and discussion below ) .",
    "this was obtained for the kerr metric , for the collision in the equatorial plane . in this section",
    ", we will show that actually this result ( in some not quite explicitly articulated form ) is already contained in @xcite ( see eqs .",
    "( 2.22 ) , ( 2.57 ) there ) in a quite general setting , and not only for the equatorial motion .",
    "we reproduce these results in a more direct way and apply them to the general question regarding the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the issue was not addressed in @xcite as at that time the corresponding context was absent .",
    "this is discussed below , as we consider different possible relations between potentially divergent quantities , including @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "as is well known from textbooks , a particle s mass @xmath5 can be found from the normalization condition for its four - momentum @xmath6 as @xmath7 for massless particles @xmath6 should be replaced with the wavevector @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider the collision of a pair of particles with momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "by analogy with the above , we can define the energy in the center of mass frame of the pair in terms of its total four - momentum at the collision event @xmath11 , as @xmath12 using this notation one can always imagine the instantaneous system composed of one compound particle of mass @xmath13 and momentum @xmath14 as an intermediate state in any collision process .",
    "although this depiction is only valid at the collision event , this is quite sufficient to derive some important general relations .      in this section",
    "we show that some of the crucial properties of the collisional penrose process follow quite straightforwardly from wald s inequalities .",
    "the wald inequality @xcite gives the range of possible energies for a fragment in the penrose process resulting from the decay of a particle in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole .",
    "for the case when a particle with mass @xmath15 and killing energy @xmath1 decays into two massless fragments , the inequality is for the ratio of the fragment s frequency measured at infinity @xmath16 to its emitted frequency @xmath17 measured in the rest frame of the decaying particle ( see formula in the footnote of @xcite ) : @xmath18 here and below @xmath19 is the value taken at the decay event .    for the collisional penrose process we substitute @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which for the two photons with frequency @xmath17 emitted in opposite directions in the cm frame is @xmath22 , so ( [ wgamma ] ) implies @xmath23 we see that for finite @xmath19 and @xmath1 , the frequency measured at infinity @xmath24 is unbounded only if @xmath25 also diverges .",
    "the situation when both quantities are unbounded is possible in the background of spacetimes with naked singularity and no horizon @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an example of the case when @xmath26 diverge , while @xmath27 stays finite , is the collisional penrose process near black holes ( see discussion in introduction above ) .",
    "thus the divergence of @xmath26 is necessary , but not sufficient for the divergence of @xmath16 .    in the limit",
    "@xmath28 the maximum possible value of the fragment s energy at infinity is @xmath29      the process of a particle s decay into two massive fragments in its center of mass frame is described by three independent parameters , such as the two fragments masses and their total energy , while the escape angles only affect how this process is seen by other observers and , by extension , the fragments killing energies .",
    "if one of the fragments with mass @xmath30 has velocity @xmath31 and lorentz factor @xmath32 in the frame of the decaying particle , then its killing energy @xmath33 is given by ( see @xcite , sec .",
    "7.65 ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angle between the spatial components of its four - velocity and the killing vector @xmath36 . in our case",
    "the decaying particle is replaced with the effective compound one as explained above , so @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath37 are measured in the center of mass frame of the colliding particles at the collision . for two identical fragments with masses",
    "@xmath38 we have @xmath39 , so , in terms of a fragment s lorentz factor at infinity @xmath40 , eq . ( [ chm ] ) implies @xmath41 once again observed energy at infinity can be unbounded only if the energy in the center of mass frame @xmath26 diverges . in this limit",
    ", @xmath28 , the maximal energy at infinity is @xmath42    in the particular case of the kerr metric , this gives us the results of @xcite obtained there by direct calculations with transformations between different frames .",
    "in particular , the general statementthat for @xmath43 to be unbounded @xmath26 also has to divergeagrees with eq . ( 49 ) and subsequent discussion of @xcite .      in deriving the above conclusions , we tacitly assumed that all metric coefficients remain finite .",
    "there is a case of interest , however , when @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to rapidly rotating spacetimes , with formally divergent @xmath45 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , ( [ gtt ] ) for the metric below ) .",
    "astrophysical significance of this situation is still unclear , but it can happen , in particular , for wormholes @xcite@xcite . in this limit both for massless ( [ w2gamma ] ) and massive ( [ chmrange2 ] ) fragments we find that the maximum energy at infinity is given by the same formulae ( [ max ] ) and ( [ ginf ] ) , so that @xmath46 even when @xmath26 is finite .",
    "we see that this quite unusual result , obtained in the aforementioned papers by detailed analysis of the conservation laws , can be simply explained with the help of the wald inequalities .      for collisional penrose process near black holes",
    "it was shown , that even when the bsw effect takes place ( so that @xmath26 diverge ) , the efficiency of the penrose process remains finite , as @xmath47 remains bounded @xcite .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ chm ] ) , so we have @xmath51 for the left hand side to be bounded , the escape velocities for those particles that reach infinity must be restricted to an ( infinitely ) narrow cone , with @xmath52 .",
    "we consider the motion of particles in the equatorial plane of an axially symmetric stationary spacetime .",
    "its metric can always be brought to the form @xmath53 there are two killing vectors , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so all metric functions depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath56 .",
    "the factor @xmath57 can be chosen to be equal to @xmath58 everywhere in the equatorial plane by redefining the radial coordinate .",
    "we will also use notation @xmath59 for the @xmath60 component of the metric tensor .",
    "although the considered spacetime is effectively three - dimensional , we will use the usual terms 4-velocity , tetrad , etc .",
    "a particle s 4-velocity can be parametrized by its integrals of motion , @xmath1 and @xmath61 , in the following way : @xmath62 here @xmath63 while @xmath64 ( which can be both positive and negative ) is determined from the normalization condition : @xmath65 for massive particles @xmath66 , while for massless ones @xmath67 .",
    "hereafter we will assume @xmath68 .    for massive particles @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath61 are the energy and angular momentum per unit mass , and for massless particles the worldline parametrization can be chosen so that they are either energy and angular momentum , or unity and impact parameter respectively .",
    "let us consider the collision of two particles with 4-velocities @xmath69 , integrals of motion @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and respective values of parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 at the event of collision .",
    "for informative description of the process it is convenient to use the locally non - rotating frame ( lnrf ) , attached to observers with zero angular momenta , orbiting at constant @xmath56 ( also called orbiting zero angular momentum observers , ozamos ) @xcite .",
    "the 1-form tetrad of this frame is @xmath74 the tetrad components of the two particles 4-velocities ( [ part4velocity ] ) are then @xmath75 and the total 4-momentum of the pair at the collision event is @xmath76    its components are @xmath77 where ( for a massless particle we should set @xmath78 and replace @xmath79 with @xmath80 ) @xmath81 here @xmath71 and @xmath70 are the killing energies of the particles per unit mass , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( in roman script ) are the total additive integrals of motion of the pair , while @xmath84 and @xmath85 are only defined in the collision event ; all values of metric functions are taken at the collision event .",
    "the total three - momentum @xmath86 and the mass , associated with energy @xmath87 and momentum @xmath86 , are @xmath88 in case the result of collision was the production of a single particle , its mass would be @xmath26 . in the general case it is the energy in the center of mass frame of the fragments .",
    "it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) , ( [ z0 ] ) and ( [ m ] ) that for the same energies and angular momenta of the colliding particles , the energy in the center of mass frame is greater when they are traveling in the opposite directions in the radial coordinate . indeed , when @xmath89 , the absolute values of @xmath90 and @xmath86 are less than when @xmath91 , while @xmath84 and @xmath87 stay the same , which leads to greater @xmath26 in ( [ m ] ) .",
    "this is a general property , not restricted to the case of the kerr metric @xcite .",
    "if the collision happens in the region where @xmath4 is small , @xmath92 , the formal limit @xmath3 yields the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath93 where @xmath94 all the metric functions other than @xmath4 are taken here at the point of expansion : if there is a horizon , where @xmath4 turns to zero , this is the horizon , for a slightly overspinned naked singularity spacetime this will be the point where @xmath95 reaches the minimum .",
    "suppose the two colliding particles have the same mass @xmath38 and fall from infinity with zero velocity , so that @xmath96 and @xmath97 , then one of them is reflected from the effective potential below the small @xmath4 region and while on the outgoing trajectory collides with the ingoing second particle .",
    "this is the regime in which @xmath26 is maximized , as noted above . in this case @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and",

    "( 70 ) of @xcite ( @xmath101 is still given by eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) ) .",
    "as discussed above , one can imagine any collision process going through an intermediate virtual stage , in which there is only one particle present , carrying the total energy and momentum of the system .",
    "therefore the two quantities , @xmath26 and @xmath87 , completely determine the initial conditions for the scattering event in the center of mass frame , except for the escape angles , which depend on the details of the interaction .",
    "the collision process looks simplest in the center of mass ( cm ) frame .",

    "the tetrad components of a particle s 4-velocity are given by eq .",
    "( [ utetrad ] ) .",

    "those that are not created in this narrow cones have diverging @xmath120 and @xmath143 , either positive or negative , with almost the same value of impact parameter @xmath231 .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that the distribution of the particles in the center of mass frame is independent of the small parameter @xmath4 and is isotropic .",
    "then almost half of the created particles , with @xmath214 , are created with large positive @xmath120 and @xmath143 . according to the previous section ,",
    "they are situated _ just above _ the forehead / horn / trunk on the whale diagram . in the black hole case with the forehead",
    ", they can not escape to infinity due to the potential barrier , but in an overspinned spacetime with the trunk they can and do escape to infinity ( we do not discuss here the case of extremal black holes ) .",
    "the other half of the particles , with @xmath232 , has large negative @xmath120 and @xmath143 . on the whale diagram",
    "they are situated _ just below _ the trunk and can only travel in the direction of smaller @xmath56 .",
    "this is what happens when the distribution of created particles in the center of mass frame is isotropic , as assumed in @xcite .",
    "this might not be very realistic assumption .",
    "the two colliding particles in the center of mass frame have large energies and momenta along the radial direction ( [ ur ] ) .",
    "therefore realistic distributions may be highly anisotropic , with the distinguished radial direction .",
    "if most of created particles are created in a narrow cone close to the radial direction , then more of them will have @xmath233 and bounded killing energies .",
    "suppose @xmath234 is the angle , such that half of the particles created in the collision are created within the cone @xmath235 . if @xmath236 , then the escape fraction will still be of the order of unity .",
    "in case @xmath234 is of the higher order by @xmath32 , the escape fraction will be suppressed by a corresponding large factor , but in case the angle @xmath237 is separated from zero or just not that small , the escape fraction will not be significantly affected .",
    "the value of the escaping fraction was obtained in @xcite through detailed calculations of allowed angles depending on the sign of @xmath85 .",
    "although these details can be of interest on their own , we see that , inasmuch we are interested in the escape fraction in the large @xmath26 limit , they are not necessary .",
    "we derived general formulas which describe the process of collision of two massive particles producing two massless ones .",
    "it was shown that the relation between the energy in the center of mass frame @xmath0 and the killing energy of a fragment @xmath1 follows immediately from the wald inequalities ; that divergence of @xmath0 is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for the divergence of @xmath1 .",
    "this , in particular , enabled us to understand the previous results for the particle collisions near the wormhole throat , when the strong inequality @xmath238 can take place .",
    "the connection between the details of the collision process in the stationary and the zamo ( lnrf ) frames was analyzed extensively , and the geometry of the escape cone was described in the general setting .",
    "the existence of a bright spot follows immediately from those general formulas .",
    "we also found the escape fraction of the fragments after collision . in the particular case of the kerr metric",
    "our results agree with those of @xcite .",
    "the work of o. z. was funded by the subsidy allocated to kazan federal university for the state assignment in the sphere of scientific activities .",
    "here we present in more detail the calculations for the integrals of motion @xmath1 and @xmath61 of one of the fragments ( [ l3][cost ] ) in terms of the collision parameters in the center of mass frame , @xmath26 and @xmath37 , and the tetrad components of the frame s momentum in the lnrf frame ( [ a])([b ] ) , as presented in section [ sec : le3 ] .",
    "we start from eq .",
    "( [ l30 ] ) for @xmath143 .",
    "it is a linear combination of @xmath239 and @xmath240 , which can be simplified step by step by using the expressions for @xmath241 ( [ chi ] ) and @xmath165 ( [ psi ] ) as follows : @xmath242 \\\\ & = \\frac{\\mathrm{l}_0 /2}{\\sqrt{g_\\phi } }      + \\frac{1}{2 } \\big[m\\cos\\psi \\sin\\theta + \\mathcal{e}\\sin\\psi \\cos\\theta \\big ] \\\\ & = \\frac{\\mathrm{l}_0 /2}{\\sqrt{g_\\phi } }      + \\frac{1}{2 } \\big[m\\frac{p_r}{p}\\sin\\theta           + \\mathcal{e}\\frac{p_\\phi}{p}\\cos\\theta \\big ] \\\\ & = \\frac{\\mathrm{l}_0 /2}{\\sqrt{g_\\phi } }      + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{m^2 + p_\\phi^2}\\ , \\sin ( \\theta-\\theta_l),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath243 this can be more elegantly written in terms of @xmath244 which brings us to ( [ l3])([costl ] ) .",
