    "wide range equations of state ( eoss ) are of practical importance in various applications of physics of extreme states of matter . the high quality eoss may be constructed nowadays in computer simulations of many - particle quantum systems .",
    "the state - of - the - art first principle approaches such as density functional theory ( dft ) overcome existing statistical theories .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity of such calculations at temperatures about tens of @xmath0 and higher becomes the major restriction for modern computers .",
    "still , it is necessary to obtain the properties of warm dense matter at these conditions as , for example , for problems of interaction of intense energy fluxes with matter .",
    "the latest improvements in the average atom models seem to have enough precision to cover the gap of strongly coupled plasma in wide range eoss between dft and ideal gas .",
    "moreover , such approaches do not require much computational resources due to deep theoretical analysis and effective simplifications .",
    "the thomas - fermi model was first developed for a single separate atom @xcite and had evident shortcomings .",
    "the idea was to consider an electron cloud surrounding the nucleus as a many - particle statistical system and interacting within a self - consistent electrostatic field .",
    "this semiclassical approach was good enough for heavy atoms with a large @xmath1 and became the basis for the further development of dft .",
    "but it turned out that bound electrons near the nucleus were inadequately reproduced with infinite density .",
    "exchange effects were also out reach of this theory what led to the improper dependency for the total binding energy .",
    "further the model was essentialy modified by various authors .",
    "dirac @xcite came with an exchange correction which was introduced as an exchange energy in a density functional .",
    "weizsacker @xcite figured out the result of rapid change of the electron density near the nucleus as gradient correction to the kinetic energy .",
    "scott @xcite introduced the correction to the total binding energy by excluding improperly accounted electron states in the thomas - fermi atom .",
    "but for practical applications the finite - temperature model was also required @xcite .",
    "this approach was good enough at high pressures and temperatures but still there were problems described above .",
    "kirzhnits @xcite introduced the generalized consistent method for accounting for quantum and exchange effects at finite temperatures .",
    "the density matrix was expanded to the required order of a semiclassical parameter in a basis of plane waves and necessary corrections appeared in the second order .",
    "later , kalitkin @xcite calculated detailed tables of thermodynamic functions for the finite - temperature thomas - fermi model with quantum and exchange corrections .",
    "this outstanding result claimed to be a solution for the problem of wide - range equations of state but still shell effects were unaccounted .",
    "the recovery of shell effects were done in the paper @xcite in the case of high pressure ionization . in the major review of the semiclassical model @xcite the shell structure of atoms had been also discussed , but the solution had not been found in the general case .",
    "all the effects may be reproduced with an exact solution of the schrdinger equation for electrons as it is done in the hartree - fock - slater approach @xcite , but in the thomas - fermi model the following reduction of the quantum effects takes place @xcite : @xmath2 the semiclassical approach is good enough for the continuous spectrum and , indeed , the main difference from the exact approach to the average atom is in the bounded states of electrons .",
    "this difference may be recovered as a correction to thomas - fermi model .",
    "the importance of shell effects for high quality eoss at finite temperatures was also discussed by iosilevsky and gryaznov @xcite in terms of comparison of the low - pressure isobars of li and na calculated by the thomas - fermi model with quantum and exchange corrections @xcite and the chemical picture model of plasma ( known also as saha model ) .",
    "the ionization of electron shells with heating leads to a stepwise increase in pressure and energy of the system what can be clearly observed in the saha model with experimental ionization potentials .",
    "the thomas - fermi model with the existing corrections was unable to reproduce such effect without accounting for the bound electron states .",
    "the shell corrections at zero temperature were calculated precisely and appeared to have strong enough effect on atomic binding energy @xcite . for practical needs",
    "the finite  temperature model was developed by galina shpatakovskaya . in the earlier works @xcite the shell correction",
    "was calculated only in the case of high temperatures and low densities .",
    "the results were compared with the saha model and here the great achievement was reached : the specific oscillations of thermodynamic functions appeared . the next step was to extend the method into the region of high densities and lower temperatures .",
    "a lot of modifications were done , even accounting of the zone structure .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the method is applicable up to the normal density and further . the significant analytical analysis allowed to reduce the complexity of calculations",
    "so that the model remains as simple as the thomas - fermi approach .",
    "moreover , it was developed in a self - similar manner , so that the results for hydrogen may be transformed for any element .",
    "it seemed that the problem of shell effects in the thomas - fermi model was solved .",
    "unfortunately , the authors of this work encountered some problems while implementing these methods for the wide - range eoss .",
    "it was found out that the shell correction was derived in different approximations for the low and high temperatures .",
    "these approaches had to be joined between 10 and 100 @xmath0 and there was no universal method to do it accurately for any element .",
    "it was inconvenient to use such a model for the wide  range calculations , so that the alternative approaches for accounting the shell effects in a more stable and precise way were developed @xcite .",
    "the obtained technique requires more calculations , but remains computationally effective for modern computers .",
