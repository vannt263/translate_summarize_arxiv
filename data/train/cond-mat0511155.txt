    "magnetic field penetrates a sample of layered superconductor forming pancake vortices in every layer of the sample .",
    "calculation of statistical properties of the pancake matter is a very complicated question for several reasons of which the following is the most important .",
    "the pancakes interact through two mechanisms , magnetic and josephson .",
    "while magnetic mechanism is reduced to pairwise interaction of the pancakes , potential energy due to the interlayer josephson coupling can not be brought down to such simple form .",
    "available methods lead to a non - local description @xcite or rely on the duality transformation @xcite which maps the pancake system onto a system of quasi - two - dimensional coulomb - like plasma .",
    "both approaches are technically complicated and difficult to generalize .",
    "alternatively , many authors neglect josephson mechanism assuming that for extremely anisotropic superconductors its influence is small compared to the effects of the magnetic interaction @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that under certain circumstances it is possible to include josephson coupling into consideration with the help of general physical devices . at sufficiently high field",
    "the josephson and magnetic interlayer coupling get smaller than the intralayer interaction . in such a situation",
    "the system is viewed as a collection of weakly coupled 2d layers . if pancakes in every layer form a structure with short range crystalline order both magnetic and josephson mechanisms could be accounted for .",
    "the resultant model is a version of the sine - gordon field theory .",
    "it could be analyzed with the help of usual field theoretical tools .",
    "the proposed approach allows one to find an upper bound for the pancake lattice melting temperature .",
    "another interesting application is that it becomes possible to compare contributions of the magnetic and josephson interactions to the statistical properties of the pancake matter .",
    "thus , we could determine under what circumstances it is possible to drop the josephson coupling from the description and when it can not be omitted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii starting from the vortex hamiltonian for the anisotropic superconductor we reproduce the well - known result for the magnetic potential energy of the pancake lattice . in sect . iii the energy due to the josephson coupling is derived . in sect .",
    "iv we compare josephson and magnetic interaction energies .",
    "the purpose of the latter comparison is to determine when it is permissible to ignore the josephson mechanism and when it is not . in sect .",
    "v we apply the derived hamiltonian to the problem of pancake lattice melting . sect .",
    "vi contains conclusions .",
    "we start with the vortex hamiltonian @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath1 the symbol @xmath2 stands for @xmath3 ; vector field @xmath4 denotes vorticity .",
    "the component @xmath5 in the @xmath6th superconducting layer coincides with the pancake density in that layer : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position of the @xmath9th vortex in the @xmath6th layer .",
    "the parallel components of the vorticity @xmath10 correspond to the josephson vortices between superconducting layers .",
    "the josephson vorticity between @xmath6th and @xmath11th layer is equal to : @xmath12\\sigma   \\right ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the spacing between neighboring layers , @xmath14 is 2d coordinate vector .",
    "function @xmath15 is defined in such a way that it is localized on a straight line connecting points @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "physically , it is non - zero on the josephson vortex which connects a pancake in @xmath6th layer and another pancake in @xmath11th layer .",
    "since a vortex can not terminate inside the superconductor we have @xmath18 or , equivalently , in fourier space @xmath19 let us rewrite the kernel @xmath20 in the following manner : @xmath21 note , that @xmath22 contains no @xmath23 . in other words",
    ", it does not depend on the josephson coupling between layers .",
    "it describes magnetic interaction between pancakes . on the contrary ,",
    "kernel @xmath24 vanishes when the josephson energy vanishes .",
    "now , using 3d - transversality of the vorticity ( eq.([div ] ) ) , we establish the following : @xmath25 this allows us to rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) : @xmath26 in other words , only the 2d - transverse part @xmath27 of the josephson vorticity @xmath28 contributes to the interaction energy .",
    "magnetic part of the energy is the easiest to handle .",
    "imagine that in every layer the pancakes form 2d crystal with short range hexagonal lattice characterized by the lattice constant @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that it is possible to choose the length scale @xmath30 in such a way that within @xmath31 the lattice translational invariance is undisturbed .",
    "although , we do not need the exact value of @xmath31 for our calculations , yet , our ability to set such a scale is imperative .",
    "if the above prerequisite is met a pancake lattice in @xmath6th layer could be described locally by a 2d displacement vector field @xmath32 .",
    "this field does not change much on the scale @xmath31 .",
    "the pancake density is expressed as : @xmath33 the sum is upon vectors of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "the 2d divergence is defined as : @xmath34 the quantity @xmath35 denotes the average density of the pancakes : @xmath36 observe , that two first terms of ( [ vz ] ) vary slowly on the scale of the lattice constant @xmath29 while the third term quickly oscillates as function of @xmath14 : @xmath37 we have for the magnetic interaction energy : @xmath38 where the symbol @xmath39 stands for @xmath40 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath41 describes the statics of the longitudinal displacements",
    ". we will not be interested in them for they are suppressed @xcite .",
    "the remaining parts are : @xmath42 the notation @xmath43 was adopted in the formula above . to avoid clutter",
    "we omit the subscript ` @xmath44 ' which denoted the transverse displacement mode : we write here @xmath32 rather than @xmath45",
    ". we will continue to do so , yet , one has to remember that the displacement vector field we consider is pure shear .",
    "the first term in the above expression gives usual @xmath46 : @xmath47 to proceed further with the second term we need to calculate @xmath22 : @xmath48 if @xmath49 which is true for @xmath50 the above expression for @xmath22 could be simplified : @xmath51 thus , we get for the second term in ( [ hmag0 ] ) : @xmath52 here we neglected the weak dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath54 since @xmath55 . finally :",
    "@xmath56 here @xmath57 is the magnitude of the smallest reciprocal lattice vectors : @xmath58 properties of the hamiltonian similar to ( [ hmag1 ] ) was investigated in @xcite",
    ".    at finite temperature the above expression could be simplified .",
    "it is enough to notice that at @xmath59 contribution of a term @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "thus , when fluctuations of the lattice are substantial it is permissible to retain in ( [ hmag1 ] ) lowest @xmath62 terms only .",
    "consequently , it is not necessary to sum over all possible @xmath63 in the above formula .",
    "it is sufficient to keep only six terms corresponding to six elementary reciprocal lattice vectors whose absolute values are equal to @xmath57 .",
    "namely , the last term of ( [ hmag1 ] ) might be written as : @xmath64 our model becomes a vector version of a sine - gordon field theory .",
    "now we add the josephson coupling to our hamiltonian .",
    "this means that we have to include the josephson vorticity as well . at first",
    "it seems like an impossible task since we have to account for the josephson vorticity fluctuations .",
    "we will demonstrate that under rather broad conditions these fluctuations could be included by simple renormalization of the josephson coupling parameter .",
    "[ h ]    on fig.1 an example of josephson vorticity fluctuation is shown . in the absence of fluctuations",
    "two pancake vortices in neighboring layers would be connected by a straight josephson vortex .",
    "fluctuations create an outgrowth on the vortex line .",
    "the size of the outgrowth is @xmath65 .",
    "the deformed vortex is represented by a solid line .",
    "the deformed vortex could be  decomposed \" into a vortex loop and a straight vortex connecting two pancakes .",
    "thus , the problem of the josephson vorticity fluctuations could be reduced to the problem of the thermally induced vortex loop gas .",
    "thermal fluctuations infuse superconductor with loops of josephson vortices of typical size @xmath65 .",
    "this size @xmath65 diverges at the superconducting transition temperature @xmath66 and vanishes at @xmath67 .",
    "it is finite at @xmath68 . loosely speaking",
    ", @xmath65 characterizes a spacial scale above which ",
    "mean - field \" josephson coupling could be defined and fluctuations are unimportant .",
    "therefore , if we are in the regime @xmath69 the fluctuations might be omitted .",
    "in such a case fluctuations result in small vibrations of the josephson vortex .",
    "the only consequence of the fluctuations would be renormalization of effective value of the josephson coupling , which is equivalent to renormalization of the penetration depth from its bare value @xmath70 to experimentally measurable value of @xmath71 .    of course",
    ", it is desirable to generalize the argumentation beyond ( [ flucti ] ) .",
    "how this could be done is discussed in appendix [ energy_of_loop ] .",
    "once we settle the issue of the fluctuations we could proceed with the derivation of the josephson contribution to the energy of the pancake system .    as in the previous section",
    "we assume that in every layer the pancakes form a 2d structure with ( at least ) short range crystalline order .",
    "remember also that the longitudinal displacements of the pancakes are suppressed . in absence of the longitudinal displacements",
    "the josephson vorticity is a periodic function of vector @xmath72 defined as ( fig.[fig2 ] ) : @xmath73    [ h ]    two - dimensional vector field @xmath74 could be expressed as a sum of smooth and oscillating parts : @xmath75 where the smooth part is equal to : @xmath76 vector function @xmath77 is defined like so : @xmath78 the lattice vector @xmath79 is chosen to deliver minimum to the expression @xmath80 ( see fig.([fig3 ] ) ) .",

    "always lies within the primitive lattice cell .",
    "physically , eq.([vort ] ) means that when two lattices are shifted only slightly with respect to each other @xmath83 .",
    "however , when @xmath82 does not fit into the primitive cell the josephson vortices rearrange themselves to minimize their own length . in this case @xmath84 .",
    "for example , if @xmath85 is the lattice vector then @xmath86 .",
    "[ b ]    next , we calculate the oscillating part .",
    "full josephson vorticity field between @xmath6th and @xmath11th layers is given by eq.([j_vort ] ) with @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is the lattice vector which shows the undisturbed position of the @xmath9th pancake ) and @xmath89 .",
    "the fourier transform of the vorticity vector field due to a single vortex @xmath9 is : @xmath90 the total vorticity is : @xmath91 it is non - zero only when @xmath63 is the reciprocal lattice vector . if @xmath63 belong to the reciprocal lattice , one prove @xmath92 thus , we have for the oscillating part : @xmath93 where the sum runs over the reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "the above expression is explicitly periodic with respect to both @xmath32 and @xmath94 .",
    "this means that if one of the layers is shifted by a lattice vector the josephson vorticity remains unaffected by such a shift .    to calculate the energy we need the transverse component of the josephson vorticity : @xmath95 } { iq_\\|^2(\\bf q_\\| g(s_{\\it n}))}\\times\\\\ & & \\left ( e^{i{\\bf q}_\\| { \\bf u}_n({\\bf r } ) } - e^{i { \\bf q}_\\| { \\bf u}_{n-1}({\\bf r } ) }",

    ". the kernel @xmath100 is non - zero for @xmath101 ( see appendix [ k ] ) since such currents spread over large regions .",
    "therefore , two josephson vortices apart from each other interact via these currents .",
    "the second term is purely local .",
    "it describes the increase of the free energy of an interlayer josephson junction due to insertion of vortices .",
    "the third term describes similar effect : the modification of the free energy of an interlayer josephson junction by a vorticity in another layer . as we will show below",
    ", this effect is small .    at low temperature , where it is possible to write @xmath102 , hamiltonian @xmath103 is responsible for the josephson contribution to the tilt modulus @xmath104 of the vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "the first term corresponds to the @xmath105 piece of @xmath104 while the second and the third terms contribute to the so - called single - vortex part ( @xmath106 ) of the tilt modulus .    at sufficiently high temperature",
    "we can not approximate @xmath77 by @xmath85 .",
    "instead we must follow different type of analysis .",
    "the term @xmath107 may be disregarded right away if @xmath108 since at low josephson coupling we could neglect correlations of the displacement fields in different layers : @xmath109 .",
    "thus , for @xmath108 @xmath110 since @xmath111 .",
    "the latter statement is obviously true for @xmath77 is an odd function .",
    "we have : @xmath112 where notation ( [ notation ] ) is used and @xmath113 are fourier transform coefficients of the odd periodic function @xmath81 .",
    "as one notices from this formula , @xmath99 is a product of four exponents of the form @xmath114 . it will be shown that @xmath115 depends on two exponents only . at high enough temperatures",
    "@xmath99 may be neglected in comparison with @xmath115 .",
    "this is because @xmath116 is proportional to @xmath117 while @xmath118 is proportional to @xmath119 and the expectation value of the exponent vanishes when @xmath44 grows .",
    "one could adopt a more formal approach . as shown in appendix [ scaling_dim ] at sufficiently large @xmath44 operator",
    "@xmath99 becomes irrelevant in the renormalization group sense while @xmath115 remains relevant up until higher temperature .",
    "in this temperature interval it is possible to neglect @xmath99 : its contribution to the thermodynamics is purely perturbative while the contribution of the relevant second term is singular .",
    "the term @xmath120 could be also disregarded for the following reason .",
    "the kernel @xmath121 may be simplified provided that the josephson length is bigger than the lattice constant : @xmath122 namely , we can write : @xmath123 the term @xmath124 is smaller than unity as long as ( [ small ] ) is valid . indeed , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "this means that @xmath127 is smaller than @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , @xmath120 ( corresponds to @xmath127 ) is much less than @xmath115 ( corresponds to @xmath128 ) .",

    "the number @xmath134 is the fourier coefficient of @xmath135 corresponding to such reciprocal vectors .",
    "this is the final equation for the josephson energy of the vortex system .",
    "let us estimate coupling constants of our hamiltonian . that way we can understand what are the largest interaction in our system and when the perturbative treatment of interactions is permissible .",
    "first , we calculate the elastic constant @xmath136 .",
    "to find it we measure area in units of @xmath137 .",
    "thus : @xmath138 for bscco @xmath139 assuming : @xmath140 the josephson constant corresponding to @xmath115 : @xmath141 the coupling constant corresponding to @xmath99 : @xmath142 using the estimate for the fourier coefficients @xmath143 we find : @xmath144 ratios of these two coupling constants to the elastic energy scale : @xmath145 and @xmath146 are both smaller than unity when ( [ small ] ) holds .",
    "this explains the physical significance of ( [ small ] ) .",
    "the latter is essentially a criterion for our vortex system to be viewed as a quasi-2d pancake gas .",
    "if ( [ small ] ) is violated the system is better described in terms of the abrikosov vortices rather than pancakes .",
    "the interlayer magnetic interaction constant could be estimated directly from ( [ hmag1 ] ) : @xmath147 the quantity @xmath148 is an estimate for number of layers coupled by the magnetic interaction with a given layer . the ratio of the magnetic and the josephson constants is : @xmath149 the last result is important for it allows one to judge when the josephson coupling could be neglected and when it must be retained .",
    "as one can see from the above formula , the ratio is independent of the magnetic field and , in that sense , it is a  material constant \" .",
    "if we take for bscco : @xmath150 then the ratio equals to 1.5 .",
    "that is , even for such an extremely anisotropic material the josephson coupling is of the same order as magnetic .",
    "in this section we find the upper bound @xmath151 on a melting temperature @xmath152 .",
    "the gist of the following calculations is that at sufficiently high temperature the interlayer coupling becomes irrelevant and the system could be thought of as a collection of 2d layers decoupled from each other . in these layers",
    "no long - range crystalline order is possible .",
    "the temperature found in this fashion is not necessary a true melting point for melting could occur at even lower temperatures through a first order phase transition .",
    "in certain situation our upper bound could serve as a reasonable estimate for the melting temperature .",
    "this happens if the josephson coupling is sufficiently strong and the difference between the solid and the liquid phases of the pancake matter is small .",
    "when this difference is exceeded by the bare josephson energy scale the phase transition is controlled by the josephson energy . since the latter vanishes at @xmath151 the melting line lies close to @xmath151 .",
    "we assume that the temperature is large so that josephson term @xmath99 is irrelevant ( see appendix [ scaling_dim ] ) .",
    "only @xmath115 part of the josephson coupling and the magnetic coupling , eq.([hmag2 ] ) , have to be accounted for .",
    "in such a regime it is possible to get @xmath153 using simple perturbative argument which we are ready to present .",
    "the crystalline phase is characterized by a non - zero order parameter : @xmath154 with the help of @xmath155 the interlayer interactions ( [ hmag2 ] ) and ( [ hj2 ] ) could be written in a mean - field manner as @xmath156 the above transformations reduces our multilayer problem to a problem for a single layer with the hamiltonian : @xmath157 it is presumed that @xmath158 is small : @xmath159 this guarantee the applicability of approximation ( [ mf ] ) .",
    "it is equivalent to ( [ small ] ) .",
    "let us transform the interlayer interaction term as follows : @xmath160 after such substitution the effective hamiltonian becomes quadratic .",
    "thus , the problem could be solved exactly . however , when solving it we must keep in mind the self - consistency condition : @xmath161=\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{q_0 ^ 2 t}{8\\pi c_{66 } } \\left [ \\ln \\frac{c_{66 } } { \\alpha } + \\langle ( { \\bf q_\\| u}_{n } ) ^2 \\rangle   + { \\rm const.}\\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equation has positive solution for @xmath162 only when @xmath163 above @xmath151 the order parameter @xmath155 is zero .",
    "since @xmath164 is a function of temperature itself , to find @xmath151 it is in fact necessary to solve the equation : @xmath165 assume that the temperature dependence of @xmath164 is given by a phenomenological formula : @xmath166 where the superconducting transition temperature @xmath66 equals to 100k for bscco .",
    "eq.([tu_eq ] ) , thus , gives : @xmath167 let us reiterate , that this result is `` high - field '' .",
    "namely , it is derived under the assumption that ( [ small ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the latter inequality is equivalent to : @xmath168 thus , there is no contradiction if at low fields ( @xmath169 ) the melting temperature is higher than @xmath151 found above .",
    "we can also find the contribution of the interlayer ( josephson and magnetic ) coupling to the total free energy density of the pancake lattice : @xmath170 where the following expression for @xmath171 was used : @xmath172 the latter expression is a trivial consequence of ( [ self - cons ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "thus , the formula for @xmath175 could be rewritten : @xmath176 interlayer contribution to the free energy , as expected , vanishes at @xmath177 .",
    "this result is useful only if the lattice remains stable close to @xmath151 , that is , if @xmath152 is close to @xmath151 .",
    "in this paper we proposed a description of the quasi-2d pancake lattice .",
    "the description is a version of an elasticity theory : the hamiltonian is a functional of the displacement field only .",
    "such a transparent structure allows easy generalization .",
    "the most obvious extension is for the case of non - zero pinning .",
    "this is an important direction for future studies .",
    "another advantage of the method is that at hight magnetic field ( eq.([high_b ] ) ) all non - harmonic terms are small .",
    "therefore , consistent perturbative analytical tools are applicable .    at present we do not include dislocations and vacancies into our model . yet ,",
    "to certain extent the effect of both dislocations and vacancies may be accounted for even at this stage . unlike the interlayer coupling , these two disorder the lattice .",
    "the interlayer coupling tries to eliminate them by binding into a topologically neutral pairs . in turn",
    ", dislocations and vacancies attempt to destroy the interlayer coupling by breaking translational order .",
    "which side wins this competition could be determined through comparison of corresponding singular corrections to the free energy .",
    "at least conceptually , this is a straightforward task .",
    "the main goal of this paper is the derivation of the model .",
    "however , we d like to discuss the most elementary of its consequences here .",
    "first of all , our model allows to compare quantitatively the magnitude of the magnetic and josephson pancake interactions .",
    "we have seen above that even for bscco ( @xmath178 ) both of these are of the same order .",
    "therefore , models which neglect the josephson interaction are only qualitatively accurate , at best .",
    "next , let us briefly discuss the application of formula ( [ tu_eq ] ) for pancake lattice melting in real layered superconductors . probably , it has no physical significance for bscco due to its extremely small josephson coupling .",
    "the total interlayer coupling is also small since the magnetic interaction is of the same order as the josephson .",
    "the transition into the liquid phase occurs because the free energy of the liquid becomes less than the free energy of the solid .",
    "small contribution of the interlayer interaction could change the melting line slightly but otherwise is insignificant .",
    "we would like to conjecture cautiously that ( [ tu_eq ] ) may be of relevance for pb - doped bscco .",
    "this superconductor has much smaller anisotropy @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "presumably , this indicates that its josephson coupling parameter is higher than that of pure bscco",
    ".    in @xcite pb - doped bscco was studied by means of magneto - optic technique .",
    "a depinning transition was observed at @xmath180 .",
    "the authors of @xcite interpreted the transition as a pancake lattice melting .",
    "remarkably , they see that this transition is field independent .",
    "this is a strong argument in favor of ( [ tu_eq ] ) being applicable since @xmath151 does not depend on the magnetic field .",
    "another field - independent melting transition , 2d dislocation unbinding , is an unlikely candidate for it occurs at much smaller temperatures .",
    "pb - doped bscco has @xmath181  k and @xmath182  nm . in @xcite @xmath183",
    "was reported to be of the order of 180  nm .",
    "thus : @xmath184 this is close to the transition at @xmath185  k reported in @xcite .",
    "the fact , that @xmath151 and @xmath186 differs by about 25% is not by itself discouraging since penetration depth @xmath164 shows strong sample - to - sample variations @xcite .",
    "it is very well possible that they are responsible for the deviation of the experimental transition temperature from its theoretical estimate .",
    "yet , the final judgment about the applicability of the presented theory is to be postponed until further investigation .    in conclusion",

    "the integral becomes : @xmath197 in deriving the above equation we used the approximation @xmath198 .",
    "this is accurate for @xmath199 or , equivalently , @xmath200 .",
    "finally , confining ourselves to the range @xmath201 we write : @xmath202 therefore : @xmath203 where @xmath151 is given by ( [ tu_eq ] ) . using ( [ xi_eq ] ) one",
    "determines : @xmath204 at @xmath177 which is the highest temperature at which the model proposed in this paper is still applicable we have @xmath205 this give us the upper bound for the characteristic size of the thermally induced josephson vorticity loops .    as it was discussed in the body of the paper we would like to have @xmath206 ( eq.([flucti ] ) ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath207 it is not difficult to notice that the latter condition is not always compatible with the requirement @xmath208 which has to be imposed to observe the quasi-2d effects of the pancake physics ( eq.([small ] ) ) .",
    "what does this mean for the analysis undertaken in this paper ?",
    "the answer to this question is that it is possible to recover virtually all of the physics described in the paper even if ( [ flucti ] ) is not satisfied as long as @xmath209 .",
    "( the quantity @xmath31 was defined in the paper as a size within which the 2d pancake lattice could be viewed as almost ideal . )",
    "let us examine how this is done .",
    "presumably , the violation of ( [ flucti ] ) might lead to problems with ( [ hj_comp ] ) .",
    "it was calculated under assumption that it is possible to define a single - vortex line tension on a scale @xmath210 .",
    "when vorticity fluctuation scale @xmath65 exceeds @xmath29 it becomes difficult to assign a well - defined line tension to a josephson vortex .",
    "thus , the analysis at the scale of @xmath29 fails .",
    "it is , however , possible to study the system at the scale of @xmath31 . at this scale",
    "we need not to be concerned with the properties of a single josephson vortex . instead",
    ", we will think in terms of average local vorticity which pierces interlayer josephson junction .",
    "imagine first the situation when pancake lattices in the @xmath6th and @xmath11th layers coincide at @xmath211 .",
    "this implies that for any @xmath14 , @xmath212 , the average josephson vorticity between these two layers is absent .",
    "thus , the local density of the josephson energy is zero .",
    "now we shift the lattices with respect to each other : @xmath213 .",
    "the average vorticity @xmath214 is no longer zero as well .",
    "we have to disentangle its contribution from contribution of the fluctuation - induced vorticity @xmath215 in the situation where fluctuations locally are strong : @xmath216 . to do so we coarse - grain the system description up to the scale @xmath190 .",
    "after this coarse - graining @xmath217 and the bare value of the penetration depth @xmath70 has to be replaced by @xmath71 .",
    "( the latter is the penetration depth measured experimentally . ) thus , at the scale @xmath218 the vorticity fluctuations could be neglected and it is possible to work with the effective josephson coupling instead of including fluctuations explicitly .",
    "the `` mean - field '' vorticity @xmath219 is a periodic function of @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that the pancake lattice energy density due to josephson coupling is a periodic function of @xmath72 as well : @xmath220 .",
    "\\label{hj_est}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is completely general : it is the lowest @xmath63 terms of periodic function fourier series .",
    "the final question now is the estimation of @xmath221 .",
    "the latter , however , is fairly trivial .",
    "as it was discussed in the body of the paper @xmath115 comes from the increase of the interlayer josephson junction energy due to non - zero @xmath219 .",
    "thus , we have match ( [ hj_est ] ) and the interlayer josephson junction free energy : @xmath222\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath223 both are zero .",
    "when @xmath224 the josephson junction energy @xmath225 is no longer zero but rather equals to @xmath226 .",
    "it is because the cos term in the above expression effectively vanishes due to fast oscillation of the phase difference .",
    "this implies that @xmath227\\right\\ }   \\sim \\frac{\\phi_0 ^ 2}{16 \\pi^3 \\lambda_c^2 d_c}. \\label{ej_est0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since maximum of the sum in this formula is equal to 9 the coupling constant @xmath221 is : @xmath228 equations ( [ hj_est ] ) and ( [ ej_esti ] ) reproduce ( [ hj2 ] ) up to a numerical constant of order unity .",
    "the derivation of ( [ hj2 ] ) developed in this appendix is more general than that found in the body of the paper for it does not rely on @xmath229 condition .",
    "the advantage of the latter , however , it its ability to give the numerical constant accurately .",
    "the fact that numerical coefficients of ( [ hj2 ] ) and ( [ ej_esti ] ) are very close is pure luck .",
    "obviously , the estimates like ( [ ej_est0 ] ) have `` order of magnitude '' precision only .",
    "numerical constant in ( [ ej_esti ] ) should not be taken too seriously .",
    "we re - derived @xmath230 above .",
    "operator @xmath231 may be re - derived in the similar fashion .",
    "in this appendix we determine the scaling dimension ( sd ) of the operators ( [ n = m ] ) and ( [ hj ] ) .",
    "we start by solving an auxiliary problem : we calculate sd of an exponent @xmath232 .",
    "the easiest way to find sd is to evaluate the correlation function : @xmath233)^2 \\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correlation function of the displacement field is found : @xmath234)^2\\rangle = \\int_{{\\bf k } } \\frac{t({\\bf q}_\\| { \\bf k})^2}{c_{66}k^4 } \\left ( 1 - e^{i{\\bf k } ( { \\bf r}^{\\vphantom { ' } } - { \\bf r } ' ) } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral over @xmath235 was evaluated in @xcite ( eq .",
    "( 9.3.33 ) and problem ( 9.9 ) of the latter reference ) : @xmath236 where ellipsis stand for terms which remain bound at @xmath237 .",
    "consequently : @xmath234)^2\\rangle = \\frac{tq_0 ^ 2 } { 4\\pi c_{66 } } \\ln |{\\bf r } - { \\bf r}'|/a_0 + \\ldots.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore : @xmath238 from this equation we can read off sd of the exponent : @xmath239 = t / t_u,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is given by ( [ tu ] ) .",
    "thus , sd of ( [ hj ] ) is equal to @xmath240 since it is a product of two exponents .",
    "this sd becomes equal to 2 when @xmath177 . at @xmath241 operator ( [ hj ] )",
    "is irrelevant , otherwise it is relevant . as usual , this mark the transition point from ordered to disordered phase driven by ( [ hj ] ) .",
    "eq.([tu ] ) establishes the same fact derived by other means .    as for ( [ n = m ] ) , its operator density is proportional to : @xmath242 here the factor @xmath243 comes from the kernel @xmath244 .",
    "the kernel @xmath245 is calculated in appendix [ k ] .",
    "sd of @xmath77 is @xmath240 as it is obvious from ( [ n = m ] ) , sd of the integration measure is -2 , sd of @xmath243 is 1 . totally , we have @xmath246 = 4t / t_u - 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equating this sd with 2 we discover that for @xmath247 operator ( [ n = m ] ) is irrelevant .",
    "therefore , is is permissible to neglect it for these temperatures . at the same time",
    ", operator ( [ hj ] ) remains relevant up until the temperature has grown to @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the discussion of the sect.[upper_bound ] is valid for @xmath248",
    "in this appendix we calculate the kernel @xmath249 required for eq.([n = m ] ) .    we must evaluate the integral : @xmath250 in most layered superconductors the screening length @xmath23 is very big .",
    "therefore , we are interested in distances @xmath251 . for such @xmath252",
    "it is possible to neglect unity under the square root and write : @xmath253 next we perform the angular integration : @xmath254 the upper limit in this integral is assumed to be large : @xmath255 .    if @xmath256 then arctg@xmath257 could be approximated by @xmath258 for almost whole integration interval .",
    "the contribution of the interval where this approximation is invalid could be evaluated separately : @xmath259 the first integral is @xmath260 .",
    "we neglect it .",
    "the second integral must be integrated by parts : @xmath261 consequently : @xmath262 \\text{\\ for\\ } r \\ll \\lambda_{\\rm j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the opposite limit @xmath263 we define a function : @xmath264 and write : @xmath265 the integral may be transformed in the following manner : @xmath266 in the last line the first integral is smaller than the second one .",
    "indeed , the first one is @xmath267 while the second is @xmath268 .",
    "therefore : @xmath269 note that : @xmath270 thus , for @xmath271 we have : @xmath272"
