    "the renormalization group ( rg ) provides an ideal framework to discuss the scaling of operators in quantum field theory . in this work we consider the scaling properties of a quantum field theory within the effective average action ( eaa ) formalism , which is a functional realization of the wilsonian renormalization program @xcite .",
    "the eaa is a scale dependent effective action whose associated action has been modified by the introduction of an infrared cutoff depending on a scale @xmath0 in such a way that low momentum modes are suppressed in the integration . in order to discuss the scaling properties within this formalism we show that the eaa satisfies , besides an exact flow equation involving the scale @xmath0 , an equation which involves the scale @xmath2 at which the boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "this equation entails an invariance under changes of `` floating normalization point '' @xmath2 very similar to one expressed by the callan - symanzik equation . in this sense",
    "this equation recalls the connection between the methods of perturbative renormalization and the wilsonian rg studied in @xcite .",
    "we carefully investigate composite operator by modifying the original action with a source dependent term which allows us to consider composite operators insertions via functional derivatives with respect to the source .",
    "we will see that the above mentioned @xmath3invariance allows defining scaling operators straightforwardly .",
    "then we comment the relation between the so defined scaling dimension and critical exponents and show that , if total derivative terms are neglected , the results are easily related .",
    "moreover we will show that introducing the sources for composite operators allows us to identify some general types of composite operators among which the descendant operators of the scaling operators at the fixed point . to make our discussion concrete we revisit the result of the local potential approximation under our perspective .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : rg - flow - of - composite - operators ] we introduce the flow equation for the eaa and for composite operators . in section",
    "[ sec : floating - normalization - point - and - scaling ] we discuss the @xmath3(in)dependence of the eaa and how scaling dimensions can be identified while in section [ sec : scaling - solutions - and - composite - operators ] we consider the local potential approximation in view of the previous discussion . in section [ sec : conclusions - and - outlooks ] we summarize our results and discuss possible outlooks .",
    "in quantum field theory a composite operator is defined as a ( local ) function of the field and its derivatives , i.e.  @xmath4 .",
    "generically , once such an operator is inserted in a correlation function new divergences appear .",
    "owing to these divergences one has to renormalize , besides the couplings of the theory , also the composite operator itself . as a result",
    "one finds that a renormalized composite operator , which we denote @xmath5 $ ] using square brackets , is a sum of various operators .",
    "for instance , at one loop in a six dimensional @xmath6 theory one finds @xmath7=c_{1}\\varphi + c_{2}\\delta\\varphi+c_{3}\\varphi^{2}$ ] , where @xmath8 are suitable coefficients @xcite . a convenient way to keep track of composite operators and their insertion into green s functions is to couple them to a source @xmath9 adding a term @xmath10 to the action as follows , the dewitt notation is used meaning that integration and index summation is intended . ] : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a suitable normalization .",
    "let us consider the generating functional @xmath13 $ ] for the connected green s functions associated to the modified action @xmath14 : @xmath15 } & \\equiv & \\int{\\cal d}\\chi\\,e^{-s-\\varepsilon\\cdot o+j\\cdot\\chi}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the connected part of the correlation function @xmath16 will be given just by the derivative @xmath17 $ ] . via a legendre transform",

    "since the insertion of one composite operator is related to a functional differentiation with respect to the source @xmath9 let us consider : @xmath20 & = & \\delta_{\\varepsilon}\\left(j\\cdot\\varphi - w\\left[j,\\varepsilon\\right]\\right)\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{\\delta j}{\\delta\\varepsilon}\\cdot\\varphi-\\left(\\frac{\\delta w}{\\delta\\varepsilon}\\left[j,\\varepsilon\\right]+\\frac{\\delta j}{\\delta\\varepsilon } \\cdot \\delta_{j}w\\right)\\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{\\delta\\gamma}{\\delta\\varepsilon}\\left[\\varphi,\\varepsilon\\right ] & = & -\\frac{\\delta w}{\\delta\\varepsilon}\\left[j,\\varepsilon\\right]\\,.\\label{eq : relation_gamma_w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this tells us that we can obtain information regarding the renormalization of composite operators by considering the renormalization of @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "as already said we shall work within the functional renormalization group ( frg ) framework .",
    "in particular we consider the rg flow of the effective average action ( eaa ) which is a scale dependent generalization of the standard effective action .",
    "one first defines a modified generating functional of connected greens functions , @xmath22 $ ] : @xmath23 } & \\equiv & \\int{\\cal d}\\chi\\,e^{-s-\\delta s_{k}+j\\cdot\\chi } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 suppresses the integration of momentum modes @xmath25 and is quadratic in the fields with a kernel @xmath26 , i.e.  @xmath27 .",
    "note that this cutoff action acts like an infrared cutoff .",
    "let us denote @xmath28 the legendre transform of @xmath29 and define the eaa subtracting the cutoff action which we added at the beginning : @xmath30 the @xmath1dependence of the functional @xmath31 satisfies the following exact equation @xcite : @xmath32\\,,\\label{eq : flow_eq_eaa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the logarithmic derivative with respect to the cutoff and @xmath34 is the hessian of the eaa . to concretely employ",
    "equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_eaa ] ) one needs to resort to some approximations and makes an ansatz for @xmath31 .",
    "such procedure has been proved robust in many fields , especially to determine scaling properties of statistical systems at criticality , see @xcite for an overview .",
    "the inclusion of composite operators in this framework is straightforward : we simply upgrade the above definitions employing the modified action @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 ( we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion regarding the flow of composite operators , see also @xcite ) . in this manner",
    "we obtain a modified generating functional @xmath37 $ ] for connected green s functions which depends also on the source @xmath9 . in full analogy with the derivation of relation ( [ eq : relation_gamma_w ] )",

    "denotes the hessian of the eaa with respect to the field @xmath44 . in order to obtain the renormalization regarding the insertion of a single composite operator we have to consider a functional derivative with respect to the source @xmath9 and set @xmath45 afterwards . in this way we obtain : @xmath46\\right)\\bigr|_{\\varepsilon=0 } & = & -\\frac{1}{2 } \\mbox{tr } \\left[\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\left(2\\right)}+r_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\frac{\\delta\\gamma_{k}^{\\left(2\\right)}}{\\delta\\varepsilon}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\left(2\\right)}+r_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\partial_{t}r_{k}\\right]\\bigr|_{\\varepsilon=0}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us observe that we can avoid performing a functional derivative with respect to the source @xmath9 and just compare order by order in @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , since we are interested just in one insertion of the composite operator , we can limit ourselves to consider an @xmath9 such that @xmath47 ( the flow equation of order @xmath48 is considered in appendix [ sec : eps2-terms ] ) .",
    "we can rewrite the flow equation as : @xmath49\\right ) & = & -\\frac{1}{2 } \\mbox{tr } \\left[\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\left(2\\right)}+r_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\varepsilon\\cdot \\left [ o_{k}\\right]^{\\left(2\\right)}\\right)\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\left(2\\right)}+r_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\partial_{t}r_{k}\\right]\\,.\\label{eq : flow_eq_composite_operator_epsilon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_operator_epsilon ] ) can be seen as an rg improved version of a one loop equation . to see this",
    "let us consider the one loop eaa @xmath50 associated to the modified action @xmath35 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the hessians for the action and the composite operator respectively .",
    "if we now differentiate the above expression with respect to the scale @xmath0 we obtain : @xmath54\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , in order to derive the running of the composite operator , we just need to take a functional derivative with respect to the source @xmath9 and set this to zero : @xmath55 & = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{tr}\\left[\\left(s^{\\left(2\\right)}+r_{k}\\right)^{-1}o^{\\left(2\\right)}\\left(s^{\\left(2\\right)}+r_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\partial_{t}r_{k}\\right]\\,.\\label{eq : flow_composite_operator_1_loop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : flow_composite_operator_1_loop ] ) is fully analogous to equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_operator_epsilon ] ) with the microscopic action @xmath36 in place of the eaa and the bare operator in place of the renormalized one .    as in the case of the flow equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_eaa ] ) ,",
    "also the flow equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_operator_epsilon ] ) has to be equipped with suitable boundary conditions , see also @xcite .",
    "when the scale @xmath0 has been lowered to zero the integration has been fully performed and we have that @xmath56 $ ] , where @xmath57 is the bare operator ( see @xcite for an analogous observation using the wilsonian action ) .",
    "finally we would like to stress the following point : in principle the renormalization of composite operators must be carried out in addition to the usual renormalization and some `` extra '' work is needed .",
    "since equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_operator_epsilon ] ) is essentially the linearization of the flow equation one may get the impression that the operator dimensions at the fixed point are given by the linearization of the rg , i.e.  by the critical exponents .",
    "and not of the type @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an arbitrary source .",
    "the latter case is considered by wilson and kogut in @xcite .",
    "however in frg computations one usually takes source independent deformations .",
    "] although critical exponents and scaling dimensions of composite operators are closely related ( as we will discuss in sections [ sub : scaling - dimension - from - flow - eq ] and [ sub : scaling - solutions ] ) there are some notable differences . to understand why this is the case",
    "let us consider a simple example : in a six dimensional @xmath6 theory the operator @xmath7 $ ] contains the operator @xmath60 @xcite , with @xmath61 .",
    "if we consider @xmath62 as a term appearing in the action , this would result simply in a surface term and as such this term would usually be neglected .",
    "when considering composite operators it is no longer so , given that @xmath63 is not a surface term .",
    "for the same reason one should distinguish between @xmath64 and @xmath65 when dealing with composite operators , in contrast to what one does with couplings appearing in the action . in the standard formulation of quantum field theory one indeed considers @xcite : @xmath66 & = & \\varepsilon\\cdot\\left(z_{21}z_{\\varphi}\\varphi^{2}+z_{22}z_{\\varphi}^{2}\\varphi^{4}+z_{23}z_{\\varphi}\\left(\\partial\\varphi\\right)^{2}+z_{24}z_{\\varphi}\\varphi\\delta\\varphi\\right ) \\",
    ", , \\label{eq : composite_operator_example_itkzub}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the wave function renormalization",
    ".    furthermore , equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_operator_epsilon ] ) can be used not only for scalar operators , but also for higher spin ones . in this case",
    "the source will carry an index , for instance @xmath68 in the case of a spin one operator .",
    "it appears clear that the renormalization of such a term can not be extracted directly from the renormalization of the theory alone and its linearization around the fixed point .",
    "finally it may happen that one is interested in the flow of some particular operator while neglecting some others .",
    "in such case our framework is particularly convenient , see @xcite for an example of such an application .",
    "in this section we discuss how rg quantities and scaling dimensions are related in the functional renormalization group framework . in particular we shall show that it is possible to infer an equation which resembles the callan - symanzik equation . by reformulating scaling arguments via the callan - symanzik equation we will obtain a generic framework which can be applied to any system of interest .",
    "besides this , our equation shows an obvious connection with the standard framework of quantum field theory and may be a useful tool for comparison with results obtained via other approaches . in section [ sub : rg - invariance - of - frg ]",
    "we describe the invariance of the eaa with respect to suitable changes of boundary conditions of the flow and derive a callan - symanzik type of equation . in section [ sub : fixed - point - and - anomalous - dim ] we extend those arguments including composite operators , while in section [ sub : scaling - dimension - from - flow - eq ] we relate these results to the usual quantities computed via the frg",
    ".    we will often work within the so called lpa@xmath69 truncation where one takes into account up to two derivatives of the field and a generic potential including the wave function renormalization of the field : @xmath70 & = & \\int\\left[\\frac{z_{k}}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\varphi\\partial^{\\mu}\\varphi+u_{k}\\left(z_{k}^{1/2}\\varphi\\right)\\right]\\,.\\label{eq : lpaprime_ansatz_zevery_field}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the extension of our arguments to more general truncations is obvious . in the above ansatz we made explicit the fact that the wave function renormalization can be looked at as an inessential coupling and can be removed via a rescaling of the field ( see @xcite for a similar discussion in the context of the wilsonian action ) .",
    "one can eventually define the field @xmath71 and insist on having a canonically normalized kinetic term .",
    "when the flow equation is expressed in terms of @xmath72 the effect of the wave function renormalization is fully contained in the appearance of the anomalous dimension . in this work",
    "we shall express the eaa as a function of @xmath44 or @xmath72 according to convenience .",
    "for the sake of simplicity let @xmath73 be a polynomial of a given order whose coefficients are parametrized by a set of dimensionful couplings @xmath74 , whose dimensionless version is denoted @xmath75 .",
    "the rg flow is given by a set of first order differential equations of the type @xmath76 let us consider a given trajectory which is associated to a boundary condition @xmath77 at the scale @xmath2 , which we could call `` floating normalization point '' .",
    "we observe that this trajectory can be labelled by many other equivalent boundary conditions along the rg trajectory at some other scale @xmath78 . in order to make this clear",
    "let us consider a simple example of a dynamical system which mimics our system of beta functions : @xmath79 let @xmath80 be the generic solution of the upper equation in ( [ eq : generic_dyn_syst ] ) and suppose that we can implement the boundary condition @xmath81 explicitly via : @xmath82 the fact that we can associate to this trajectory many other boundary conditions is expressed by the vanishing of the total derivative with respect to @xmath83 : @xmath84\\\\   & = & -\\frac{d}{dt_{0}}f\\left(t_{0}\\right)+\\dot{x}_{0}\\\\   & = & -\\dot{x}_{0}+\\dot{x}_{0}=0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second line we took care of both the explicit presence of @xmath83 in the first term and of the implicit dependence of @xmath85 on the `` normalization point '' @xmath83 .",
    "thus we can rewrite the above equation as : @xmath86 note that the boundary condition @xmath85 may enter in the solution in many possible ways and not just as shown in ( [ eq : sol - of - simple - dyn - syst ] ) .",
    "the invariance under the operator in the rhs of equation ( [ eq : invariance - under - bc - in - sistdin ] ) is guaranteed by the following reasoning : given a trajectory ( i.e.  a solution of the equation ) associated to the boundary condition @xmath85 at @xmath83 , we observe that the same trajectory can be associated to many other boundary conditions along the same trajectory at some other points @xmath87 , see figure [ img : sist_din_traj ] .    ) .",
    "the couples @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are possible boundary conditions associated to the trajectory @xmath91 . ]",
    "this means that the selected trajectory @xmath92 is invariant under translations of the boundary condition along the trajectory itself .",
    "thus the solution is not invariant under any change of the couple @xmath93 but is invariant under those changes which bring @xmath93 into another point along the solution .",
    "indeed this is exactly what is implemented by the operator of equation ( [ eq : invariance - under - bc - in - sistdin ] ) . to see this",

    "as such we could discard this term at separate points .",
    "however , it is important to stress that most likely it is crucial to keep @xmath320 as a semilocal ( as opposed to local ) term .",
    "a simple example of this is given in @xcite where the author considers the wilsonian action keeping track of the source @xmath321 conjugate to the field . in order to obtain the correct two - point correlation function from two @xmath322differentiations ,",
    "it is crucial to keep a semilocal term at order @xmath323 .    equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_second_order_epsilon ] ) is potentially the starting point to study in a nonperturbative setting the correlation functions with two insertions of composite operators . in turn",
    "this implies the possibility of studying the operator product expansion coefficients along the lines of @xcite . in this sense",
    "the study of the @xmath324 terms is a first step in this direction .",
    "in this appendix we consider the results of the lpa@xmath69 truncation and compare them with the exact results coming from conformal field theory ( cft ) . in particular we shall consider the critical and tricritical ising model in two dimensions and the ising model in three dimensions . according to the discussion of sections [ sub :",
    "fixed - point - and - anomalous - dim ] , [ sub : scaling - dimension - from - flow - eq ] and [ sub : scaling - solutions ] in the lpa@xmath69 approximation for composite operators we are led to identify the full dimension of the scaling operators @xmath251 as @xmath325 , where @xmath260 is a critical exponent .",
    "it is thus straightforward to use the known results regarding critical exponents to deduce anomalous dimensions of composite operators under these approximations .",
    "we shall consider the results of reference @xcite whose methods allow to find several eigendirections in a systematic manner , see also @xcite .      in two dimensions , by means of cft techniques @xcite , it has been possible to exactly compute the scaling dimension of the operators in the theory .",
    "in particular the critical and tricritical ising models correspond to the minimal models having central charge @xmath326 with @xmath327 and @xmath328 . in the following",
    "we compare the exact results with our approximations and comment the results .",
    "the correspondence between composite operators of the landau - ginzburg hamiltonian and the scaling fields of the cft is due to zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "let us consider the ising model .",
    "table [ table : ising2d ] shows the first four scaling operators ( the identity operator is not shown ) found using equations ( [ eq : lambda_composite_operator_integrated ] ) and ( [ eq : flow_eq_for_critical_exponents ] ) .",
    "as already anticipated the estimate for the anomalous dimension of the field has a large error .",
    "this is a known feature of the lpa@xmath69 truncation and better results can be obtained by employing a more general kinetic term of the form @xmath329 @xcite .",
    ".scaling dimension in the critical ising model .",
    "the first column indicates the composite operator whose exact scaling dimension is reported in the second column .",
    "the third column lists the scaling dimensions obtained within the lpa@xmath69 approximation using the critical exponents computed in reference @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as in the other models that we have discussed , the anomalous dimension of the field is poorly determined under our approximations .",
    "we note that @xmath7 $ ] is relatively close to the exact value while for the other operators the results are not so precise .",
    "the operator @xmath330 $ ] can be identified with the redundant operator @xmath308 .",
    "being redundant this operator must be discarded and indeed it finds no counterpart in the part of table [ table : ising3d ] dedicated to the bootstrap approach . furthermore the result for @xmath331 $ ] has a large error compared to the bootstrap results @xcite two values coming from the bootstrap approach are shown .",
    "the difference in the result depends on whether an operator disappears or not from the spectrum @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy should eventually disappear .",
    "our result is however rather `` wrong '' in both cases . ] .",
    "moreover the arguments of section [ sub : some - simple - composite - operators ] allow us to easily up - grade our solution to include the descendants of the fields in table [ table : ising3d ]",
    ". however , given the difficulties encountered with the two dimensional ising model , we feel that one should take the identifications of table [ table : ising3d ] with a grain of salt , especially regarding @xmath331 $ ] .",
