    "there has been considerable progress in understanding the relation between lbgs , smgs , drgs and bzk galaxies .",
    "chapman et al .",
    "2005 confirmed that some of the scuba galaxies have rest - frame - uv colours typical of the lbgs . using irac and mips observations , huang et al .",
    "2006 has shown that lbgs detected in mips 24@xmath0 m band , ( infrared luminous lbgs ) and cold scuba sources share similar [ 8.0]@xmath6[24 ] colours , while rigopoulou et al .",
    "2006 suggest that illbgs and scuba galaxies tend to have similar stellar masses and dust amount .",
    "a possible scenario is one in which sub - mm galaxies and lbgs form a continuum of objects with smgs representing the reddest dustier and more intensively star - forming lbgs , but further investigation is required to establish a more secure link between these two populations .",
    "lbgs constitute at the moment the largest and most well studied galaxy population at z@xmath23 ( steidel et al .",
    "2003 ) . based on observations of the uv continuum emission ,",

    "this star formation rate increases significantly if corrected for dust attenuation , to a mean value of @xmath2100@xmath10/yr .",
    "correction for dust attenuation must be taken into account as there is clear evidence for the presence of significant amounts of dust in the galactic medium of lbgs ( e.g. , sawicki @xmath4 yee 1998 , vijh 2003 ) .    to investigate the amounts of dust in the lbgs",
    ", various techniques and observations spanning from optical to x - rays have been used .",
    "the techniques range from studies of optical line ratios ( pettini et al .",
    "2001 ) to formal fits of the overall sed of lbgs based on various star formation history scenarios ( e.g. , shapley et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 , papovich et al . 2001 ) and x - ray stacking studies ( e.g. , nandra et al . 2002 , reddy@xmath4steidel 2004 ) .",
    "all approaches agree that lbgs with higher star formation rates contain more dust ( e.g. , adelberger @xmath4 steidel et al .",
    "2000 , reddy et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "one of the most important properties of the population is the stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "stellar masses play a central role to the understanding of the evolution of the lbgs , as the co - moving stellar mass density at any redshift is the integral of the past star - forming activity and suffers fewer uncertainties than the star formation rate .",
    "most of the attempts to estimate the stellar content of the lbgs were based on ground based observations . as the observed optical band corresponds to rest - uv for galaxies at z@xmath23 ,",
    "most of the light emitted from the galaxy at these wavelengths is radiated from young and massive ob stars .",
    "therefore , optical observations can not be regarded as a robust tool to probe the stellar mass of the galaxy as they are sensitive only to recent star formation episodes rather than the stellar population that has accumulated over the galaxy s life - time .",
    "observations at longer wavelengths , i.e. , rest - near - infrared ( e.g. bell & dejong 2001 , where the bulk of the stellar population radiates are essential to constrain the stellar content of the z@xmath23 galaxy population .    with the advent of the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .",

    "thus , with irac data in hand we have a powerful tool to probe in a more secure way the stellar content of the lbgs .",
    "recent results of adding irac photometry to stellar mass estimates have been presented in e.g. , barmby et al .",
    "2004 for z@xmath23 , shapley et al . 2005 for bx / bm objects and reddy et al . 2006 for z@xmath223 .",
    "also , irac colours combined with ground based data , can enlighten the diversity of the population revealing the existence of different sub - classes of lbgs , and provide an insight to their physical properties such as the energy source that powers the lbgs .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section 2 reviews the data of this study and presents the source extraction and the photometric analysis , as well as , the differential number counts for each field .",
    "section 3 focus on the mid - infrared identifications of lbgs , while in section 4 the rest frame near - infrared photometric properties of the lbgs are discussed .",
    "finally , section 5 summarises the main results of this study .",
    "all magnitudes appearing in this study are in ab magnitude system .",
    "the data for this study have been obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ) ( fazio et al .",

    "the majority of our data are part of the irac guaranteed time observation program ( gto , pi g. fazio ) and include the fields : q1422 + 2309 ( q1422 ) , dsf2237a , b ( dsf ) , q2233 + 1341 ( q2233 ) , ssa22a , b ( ssa22 ) and b20902 + 34 ( b0902 ) while data for the hdfn come from the great observatories origin deep survey program ( goods , pi m. dickinson ) .",
    "irac has the capability of observing simultaneously in four , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath0 m bands , covering one 5@xmath14x5@xmath14 field at 3.6@xmath0 m and 5.8@xmath0 m and an adjacent 5@xmath14x5@xmath14 field at 4.5@xmath0 m and 8.0@xmath0 m .",

    "this can be easily understood from figure 7 . in all but hdfn fields , there are very few or zero detections at magnitudes fainter than 24 .",
    "it is therefore expected that lbgs with r@xmath6[3.6 ] @xmath9 1.5 are under - represented in the sample of the shallow fields . to quantify this under - detection of @xmath18blue@xmath18 lbgs in the shallow fields we compare the fraction of population with r@xmath6[3.6 ] @xmath9 1 ( where the depth of the observation becomes significant ) between the two samples .",
    "lbgs with r@xmath6[3.6 ] @xmath9 1.0 in hdfn accounts for the @xmath231.3@xmath15 of the total detected lbgs while in the shallower fields this fraction drops to @xmath217.7@xmath15 .",
    "therefore , a simple assumption would be that @xmath18blue@xmath18 lbgs in the shallower fields are under - represented by @xmath214@xmath15 , that corresponds to @xmath245 missing @xmath18blue@xmath18 lbgs .",

    "the above discussion is clearly demonstrated in figure 11 where we present the [ 3.6 ] magnitude distribution of lbgs with r@xmath6[3.6 ] @xmath3 1.5 and r@xmath6[3.6 ] @xmath9 1.5 , for the two individual samples as well as for whole sample .",

    "this is what we call the the sample of the 8@xmath0 m lbgs . in total 8@xmath0 m counterparts",
    "were detected in 152 lbgs and the detection rate is significantly lower when compared to that at 3.6@xmath0 m and 4.5@xmath0 m .",

    "again , useful conclusion can be derived from the comparison of the two sets of fields ( hdfn - the rest ) .",
    "the detection rate of 8@xmath0 m lbgs in hdfn is @xmath250@xmath15 while for the rest fields falls dramatically to @xmath217@xmath15 .",
    "a simple assumption would be that in the shallower fields the 8@xmath0 m sample is under - represented by @xmath233@xmath15 . as shown in figure 12 , all lbgs in hdfn with [ 3.6]@xmath923 are detected at 8.0@xmath0 m while for the shallower fields the number of lbgs lacking 8@xmath0 m counterpart at [ 3.6]@xmath223 are comparable with those detected at that band .",
    "we can therefore assume that the lbgs in the shallower fields having [ 3.6]@xmath923 but not detected at 8@xmath0 m do have an 8@xmath0 m counterpart but the observation was not deep enough to be detected .",
    "this is the minimum estimation of the undetected lbgs at 8@xmath0 m , as the fraction of detected / undetected at 8@xmath0 m remains higher for hdfn for the whole range of [ 3.6 ] magnitudes .",
    "+    this non - detection of 8@xmath0 m mainly affects the r@xmath6[3.6 ] @xmath3 1.5 population of the sample and this is shown clearly in figure 13 .",
    "according to the previous analysis , there are @xmath240 lbgs in the shallower fields with r-[3.6 ] @xmath3 1.5 that should have been detected at 8@xmath0 m , while for the r@xmath6[3.6]@xmath91.5 the missing lbgs are @xmath218 .",

    "+    the significance of the 8@xmath0 m sample is that for @xmath233 , 8@xmath0 m correspond to k rest - frame , sensitive to the bulk of the stellar emission of a galaxy and not only to the young population of a recent star - forming event . in the first study of _ spitzer _ detection of lbgs - z , rigopoulou et al .",
    "2006 suggests that lbgs - z detected in 8@xmath0 m band are dustier , more massive and relatively older than those with no detection .",
    "but her sample was small , covering lbgs - z from the egs ( extended groth strip ) field . to put the rigopoulou results on a secure statistical footing , in a forthcoming paper we use the current sample to constrain the physical properties of the lbgs - z and investigate the origin of the 8@xmath0 m emission .     +      as discussed before , lbgs exhibit a much wider range of flux densities in the irac bands than in the rest - uv .",
    "figure 8 shows that the range of 3.6@xmath0 m flux densities for the lbgs spans 6 mags , compared to only 3 mag for the range of rest uv - band flux density . to investigate the infrared colours of the lbgs",
    ", stellar synthesis population models can be employed .",
    "figure 15 compares the observed lbg colours with those predicted by two simple stellar population synthesis models generated with the new charlot & bruzual code that includes an observationally calibrated agb phase ( cb07 private communication ) .",
    "we considered both single burst and constant star formation models , assuming solar metallicity and salpeter imf .",
    "these two models correspond to two extreme cases of a model having an exponentially decaying star formation rate , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the single - burst model and @xmath26 is the constant star formation model .",
    "the model seds were generated for dust free and e(b @xmath6 v)= 0.3 and for a grid of ages , ranging from 1 myrs to 2 gyrs .",
    "they were then redshifted at z@xmath23 matching the predicted [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] and r @xmath6 [ 3.6 ] colours of star forming galaxies .",
    "although colour  colour diagrams are not the best way to constrain the properties of the stellar population s of a given galaxy class as one would have more free parameters than data points , we note that a combination of the two models with varying amounts of dust attenuation could reproduce the majority of the lbgs ( with spectroscopic redshift ) colours .",
    "this plot also shows that most of the lbgs without spectroscopic redshift , do have colours that are consistent with a galaxy at z@xmath23 , while stars can be screened out from their blue [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] colours . a more detailed study to estimate the stellar masses and the other physical properties of lbgs",

    "<S> we present photometric analysis of deep mid - infrared observations obtained by spitzer / irac covering the fields q1422 + 2309 , q2233 + 1341 , dsf2237a , b , hdfn , ssa22a , b and b20902 + 34 , giving the number counts and the depths for each field . in a sample of 751 lbgs lying in those fields , 443 , 448 , </S>",
    "<S> 137 and 152 are identified at 3.6@xmath0 m , 4.5@xmath0 m , 5.8@xmath0 m , 8.0@xmath0 m irac bands respectively , expanding their spectral energy distribution to rest - near - infrared and revealing that lbgs display a variety of colours . </S>",
    "<S> their rest - near - infrared properties are rather inhomogeneous , ranging from those that are bright in irac bands and exhibit @xmath1-[3.6]>1.5 $ ] colours to those that are faint or not detected at all in irac bands with @xmath1-[3.6]<1.5 $ ] colours and these two groups of lbgs are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the mid - ir colours of the lbgs with the colours of star - forming galaxies and we find that lbgs have colours consistent with star  foming galaxies at z@xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the lbgs detected in the 8@xmath0 m irac band ( rest frame k - band ) are examined separately , showing that they exhibit redder@xmath1-[3.6]$ ] colours than the rest of the population and that although in general , a multi  wavelength study is needed to reach more secure results , irac 8@xmath0 m band can be used as a diagnostic tool , to separate high z , luminous agn dominated objects from normal star - forming galaxies at z@xmath23 . </S>"
