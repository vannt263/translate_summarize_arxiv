    "yellow hypergiants are post - red supergiants , rapidly evolving toward the blue supergiant phase .",
    "they are among the prime candidates for progenitors of type ii supernovae in our galaxy .",
    "this type of massive supergiant is very important to investigate the atmospheric dynamics of cool stars and their poorly understood wind acceleration mechanisms that cause excessive mass - loss rates above @xmath6 @xmath7 ( lobel et al .",
    "1998 ) . these wind driving mechanisms are also important to study the physical causes for the luminosity limit of evolved stars ( lobel 2001a ; de jager et al . 2001 ) .",
    "@xmath0 cas is a rare bright cool hypergiant , which we are continuously monitoring with high spectral resolution for more than a decade ( lobel 2004 ) .",
    "its he - core burning phase is accompanied by tremendous episodic mass - loss events , which we recently observed with a new outburst between 2000 july and 2001 april ( lobel et al .",
    "2003a ) .    in quiescent pulsation phases",
    "@xmath0 cas is a luminous late f - type supergiant ( lobel et al .",
    "1994 ) . during a tremendous outburst of",
    "the star in 1945 - 47 strong absorption bands of titanium - oxide ( tio ) suddenly appeared in its optical spectrum , together with many low excitation energy lines , not previously observed .",
    "these absorption lines , normally observed in m - type supergiants , were strongly blue - shifted , signaling the ejection of a cool circumstellar gas shell . in july 2000 we observed the formation of new tio bands during a strong @xmath8-brightness decrease by @xmath2@xmath9 ( _ fig . 1 _ ) .",
    "our synthetic spectrum calculations show that @xmath10 decreased by at least 3000 k , from 7250 k to @xmath114250  k , and the spectrum became comparable to the early m - type supergiants @xmath12  cep and betelgeuse .",
    "the tio bands reveal the formation of a cool circumstellar gas shell with @xmath13@xmath144000 k due to supersonic expansion of the photosphere and upper atmosphere .",
    "we observe a shell expansion velocity of @xmath15=35@xmath162  @xmath17 from the tio bands . from the synthetic spectrum",
    "fits to these bands we compute an exceptionally large mass - loss rate of @xmath18@xmath115.4@xmath19@xmath20  @xmath7 , comparable to the values estimated for the notorious outbursts of @xmath21 carinae ( lobel et al .",
    "2002 , 2003b ) .",
    "over the past three years since the outburst we observed an unusually strong inverse p cygni profile in balmer h@xmath1 , indicating a new collapse of @xmath0 cas s extended upper atmosphere . over the past year",
    "we observe how the h@xmath1 line transformed from a prominent inverse p cygni profile into a p cygni profile ( _ fig . 3 _ ) .",
    "the p cygni line shape of h@xmath1 is very remarkable because it was not clearly observed during the 2000 brightness minimum .",
    "it indicates a new strong expansion of the upper atmosphere .",
    "we currently measure expansion velocities up to 120  @xmath3 for the h@xmath1 atmosphere .",
    "our very recent high - resolution spectroscopic observations of april 2004 indicate that the p cygni line shape further strengthens , resulting in a new and exceptional variability phase of enhanced mass - loss .",
    "this spectral evolution is expected since we observe that the radial velocity curve of the absorption portion of h@xmath1 is at least twice longer than the ( quasi- ) period of photospheric absorption lines with @xmath22@xmath2300 - 500 d ( lobel 2001b ) .",
    "figure 5 shows dynamic spectra of h@xmath1 and fe  i @xmath235572 observed between 1993 and late 2003 .",
    "the white spots in h@xmath1 are emission above the stellar continuum level . the radial velocity curves of the h@xmath1 absorption core and the photospheric fe  i lines ( _ white dashed lines _",
    ") reveal a velocity stratified dynamic atmosphere .",
    "notice the large blueshift of the fe  i lines during the outburst of mid 2000 .",
    "the outburst is preceded by enhanced emission in the short wavelength wing of h@xmath1 , while the fe  i line shifts far redward . a strong collapse of the upper h@xmath1 atmosphere and the lower photosphere precedes the outburst event during the pre - outburst cycle of 1999 ( lobel et al",
    ". 2003c ) ( see _ fig . 1 _ ) .",
    "the optical and near - ir spectrum of @xmath0 cas ( ia0e ) only sporadically reveals prominent emission lines .",
    "the emission lines are due to neutral and singly ionized atoms . in a spectrum of @xmath0 cas",
    "we observed on 29 july 2004 , many exceptionally strong emission lines with low excitation potentials have re - appeared .",
    "the lines have only been observed in emission during previous phases of very fast atmospheric expansion in late 93 ( lobel 1997 ) , fall 1998 , and early 2002 .",
    "figure 2 shows how the ni  i @xmath236108 line transformed from absorption into emission with the fast expansion of the upper atmosphere over the past half year .",
    "the line appears however in absorption during pulsation phases of photospheric collapse when @xmath10 increases .",
    "the formation of these rare emission lines therefore appears linked with an excitation phenomenon that can result from supersonic wind expansion during exceptional variability phases .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the emission spectrum is excited by a propagating circumstellar shock wave passing through the line formation region in the extended outer atmosphere ( de jager et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the optical and near - ir emission line spectrum of @xmath0 cas is currently under investigation together with the far - uv spectrum observed with @xmath4 on 27 july 04 .",
    "the @xmath4 spectrum does not reveal the high temperature emission lines of o  vi @xmath231032 & @xmath231037 ( _ fig 4 _ ) , or the c  iii @xmath23977 line .",
    "our far - uv observations also demonstrate that there is no evidence of a faint hot ( e.g. white dwarf ) companion star in @xmath0 cas , also ruled out by our long - term radial velocity and light curve monitoring .",
    "however , we clearly observe these warm transition region plasma emission lines in the classical cepheid variable @xmath5 dor ( f - g iab - ia ) .",
    "its smaller radius of @xmath24=64  @xmath25 , compared to @xmath0 cas ( @xmath24@xmath11400 - 500 @xmath26 with log(@xmath27)=0.5 - 1.0 ) , signals that the larger average atmospheric gravity acceleration is an important stellar parameter to sustain high - temperature plasmas in the outer atmosphere of less luminous ( pulsating ) supergiants .",
    "this is supported by the observation that transition region plamsa emission lines are also absent in red supergiant @xmath1 ori with @xmath24=700 @xmath25 and log(@xmath27)=@xmath280.5 .",
    "we present new recent spectral observations of the yellow hypergiant @xmath0 cas that reveal enhanced dynamic activity of its pulsating atmosphere during the past three years after the outburst event of 2000 .",
    "a strong inverse balmer h@xmath1 p cygni profile that transformed into a p cygni profile , currently signals supersonic wind expansion up to 120 @xmath3 of the upper atmosphere with enhanced mass - loss . during the fast atmospheric expansion we observe the return of a prominent neutral and singly ionized atomic emission line spectrum in the optical and near - ir .",
    "very recent observations of the far - uv spectrum with @xmath4 demonstrate the absence of high ion emission lines due to warm transition region plasma in the extended dynamic atmosphere of the hypergiant .",

    "<S> the yellow hypergiant @xmath0 cassiopeiae ( f - g ia0 ) has recently become very active with a tremendous outburst event in the fall of 2000 . during the event the pulsating supergiant dimmed by more than a visual magnitude , while its effective temperature decreased from 7000 k to below 4000 k over about 200 d , and we directly observed the largest mass - loss rate of about 5% of the solar mass in a single stellar outburst so far . over the past three years since the eruption we observed a very prominent inverse p cygni profile in balmer h@xmath1 , signaling a strong collapse of the upper atmosphere , also observed before the 2000 event . </S>",
    "<S> continuous spectroscopic monitoring reveals that the h@xmath1 line profile has transformed into a p cygni profile since june 2003 , presently ( sept 2004 ) signaling supersonic expansion velocities up to @xmath2120 @xmath3 in the extended upper atmosphere , comparable to the 2000 outburst . with the new fast atmospheric expansion many strong neutral atomic emission lines have appeared in the optical and near - ir spectrum over the past half year .    based on the very recent unique spectral evolution we observed the far - uv spectrum with the @xmath4 satellite in july 2004 . </S>",
