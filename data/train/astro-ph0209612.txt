    "extended emission - line regions ( eelr ) around radio galaxies are common , and often aligned with the axes of the extended radio emission ( e.g.  mccarthy et al .  1987 ;",
    "mccarthy 1993 ; mccarthy , baum & spinrad 1996 ) .",
    "there is considerable debate as to whether eelr are ionized by photons from the nucleus or by shocks driven by the jets ( e.g.tadhunter et al .",
    "most eelr around low - redshift sources can adequately be described by central - illumination models , while sources which show evidence for shock ionization ( such as extreme emission - line kinematics ) are largely at high redshift .",
    "however , there is evidence that a small minority of low - redshift radio galaxies are also more adequately described by a shock - ionization model .",
    "if the ionization is due to shocks , the physical conditions in and kinematics of the eelr may give us important information about the energetics of the radio source as a whole .",
    "one good candidate low - redshift shock - ionization source is 3c171 , an unusual @xmath0 radio galaxy .",
    "its large - scale radio structure has been well studied ( heckman , van breugel & miley 1984 ; blundell 1996 ) . in its inner regions",
    "it is similar to a normal frii , but low - surface - brightness plumes instead of normal lobes extend north and south from the hotspots .",
    "high - resolution images show knotty jets connecting the radio core with the hotspots ( hardcastle et al .",
    "3c171 is associated with a prominent eelr , elongated along the jet axis .",
    "heckman et al .  found that the emission - line gas was brightest near the hotspots , suggesting that the radio - emitting plasma is responsible for powering the emission - line regions .",
    "more recently clark et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have made wht observations of the emission - line regions and shown that their ionization states are most consistent with a shock - ionization model .",
    "the unusually strong eelr in this source may be indicative of an environment unusually rich in dense , warm gas ; the interactions between the jets and this gas might then be responsible for the peculiar large - scale radio structure .",
    "heckman et al .  pointed out the depolarization of the radio source near the hotspots at frequencies up to 15 ghz .",
    "the strong spatial relationship between the eelr ( or the material traced by the eelr ) and depolarization was pointed out by hardcastle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who superposed an 8-ghz very large array ( vla ) image on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) snapshot ( de koff et al .",
    "1996 ) in the f702w filter ( which at this redshift passes several strong lines ) .",
    "the source has since been observed with a number of other _ hst _ filters , and fig .",
    "1 shows a superposition of the 8-ghz map on an _ hst _ image in the [ oiii]495.9/500.7 nm lines .",
    "regions of low polarization in the radio map can be seen to correspond to the positions of emission - line material .",
    "the eastern hot spot is almost completely unpolarized at 8 ghz and below , while the western hot spot is partially depolarized .",
    "the close assocation between the emission - line regions and the radio depolarization in 3c171 opens up the possibility of using radio data to constrain unknown physical conditions , such as the electron number density and the magnetic field strength in the gas surrounding the source . in this paper ,",
    "i present new radio observations of 3c171 , and discuss the constraints that they place on the nature of its environment .    throughout the paper ,",
    "i use a cosmology with @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . at the redshift of 3c171 , 1",
    "arcsec corresponds to 4.07 kpc .",
    "the degree of depolarization is in general expected to be reduced at higher frequencies and higher resolutions . as parts of 3c171 s hotspots had been found to be completely depolarized at the full resolution of the vla ( @xmath5 arcsec ) at 8.1 ghz , i elected to observe the source with the a and b arrays of the vla at the u and k bands , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ghz .",
    "in addition , i made use of the a - array 8.1-ghz observations discussed by hardcastle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "details of the observations used are listed in table [ obstab ] .",
    "the new observations were carried out in fast - switching mode with an integration time of 3.3 s , using frequent observations of a nearby bright point - source calibrator , 0749 + 540 .",
    "the cycle time used was 320 s , with 80 s on calibrator and 240s on source , giving typical times of 50 s on the calibrator and 210 s on source after dead time due to slewing .",
    "( the low efficiency was due to the lack of a good nearby calibrator . )",
    "primary referenced pointing was carried out , using short x - band observations of 0749 + 540 taken every hour , to avoid loss of sensitivity due to vla pointing errors .",
    "the observations were made with two nearby observing frequencies ( table [ obstab ] ) with a 50-mhz bandwidth in each .",
    "3c286 was used as the flux and polarization position angle calibrator .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner within aips .",
    "elint was used to correct for the dependence of antenna gain on elevation .",
    "the use of fast - switching mode led to observations which were very well phase- and amplitude - calibrated after the standard calibration procedure : however , there was enough signal for a single iteration of phase self - calibration for each dataset , which gave a marginal improvement in image quality .",
    "finally , the a- and b - array datasets were combined using dbcon , uvfix was used to align the datasets at the three wavelengths at the radio core , using the k - band dataset as the reference , and final images were made using imagr , combining the data from the two observing frequencies in each band .",
    "this resulted in images at effective frequencies of 8.09 , 14.94 and 22.46 ghz . for simplicity",
    ", these frequencies will be referred to as 8 , 15 and 22 ghz from now on .",
    ".vla observations [ cols= \" < , < , > , > , < , > \" , ]     the ` image ' column describes the resolution of the image used : ` full ' denotes the full resolution of the dataset , ` 8 ' means matched to the 8-ghz dataset , and ` 15 ' means that the image was matched to the 15-ghz dataset ( the images are those described in table [ maps ] ) .",
    "all images were made with matched shortest baselines .",
    "the errors on the polarized intensity are determined from the off - source r.m.s .",
    "noise in the stokes @xmath8 and @xmath9 images .",
    "errors on the total intensity are similar in magnitude , but are not quoted as they are not a significant contributor to the errors in fractional polarization .",
    "we can begin by making the assumption that the depolarizing medium is external to the source .",
    "this is justified by the extremely good , though not perfect , association between the eelr and the depolarization .",
    "no model places the eelr inside the radio source  it is spatially quite distinct from , and physically larger than , the radio emission at various points ( fig .  1 )  and",
    "at the same time it is clearly related to the depolarization .",
    "we can therefore treat the depolarizing material as an external screen of dimensions comparable to those of the eelr .",
    "the situation is then a classical problem in the theory of radio polarization , discussed by burn ( 1966 ) .",
    "if a screen is external , two extreme cases can be identified . in the first ,",
    "the faraday screen is fully resolved by the telescope beam : in this case , no depolarization should be observed , but faraday rotation should be seen .",
    "some sources in rich cluster environments appear to be in this regime , in that the faraday screen is partially or fully resolved ( e.g.  perley & carilli 1996 ) . in 3c171 , however , we see significant depolarization without much associated faraday rotation , as fig .",
    "[ depol ] shows .",
    "this is likely to be due to a largely unresolved foreground screen . in the limit that the size scale @xmath10 of the individual depolarizing regions ( regions of uniform magnetic field ) is much smaller than the resolution element ,",
    "_ and is well defined _ , and that there are many regions along each line of sight , the degree of polarization @xmath11 of a part of the source seen through such a screen at a given frequency @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 \\label{depeq}\\ ] ] ( burn 1966 ) where @xmath14 is the intrinsic polarization , @xmath15 is a constant with value @xmath16 rad nt@xmath2 m kpc@xmath2 , @xmath17 is the dispersion in the product of number density and magnetic field strength and @xmath18 is the line - of - sight depth through the medium .",
    "we can try to apply this model to the observations , but there are a number of reasons why it should be treated with caution .",
    "the first is a practical one : the measurements of the polarized intensity of the hotspots clearly include regions with different degrees of polarization ( fig .",
    "[ depol ] ) and so , presumably , different physical conditions in the depolarizing screen .",
    "at best we will obtain some emission - weighted average of the physical conditions . to reduce this effect",
    ", i consider below only the e hotspot , which exhibits more uniform depolarization .",
    "the model is also not realistic .",
    "it assumes a single physical size scale for the variations in faraday depth , parametrized by @xmath10 . as laing ( 1984 )",
    "points out , realistic screens will have a range of scale sizes , which tends to wash out the sharp cutoff in polarization at low frequencies .",
    "this is probably the case for our observations : the degree of polarization at 8 ghz , though low , is still too high to be fitted with a simple model of the form of eq.[depeq ] . if we write eq .",
    "[ depeq ] as @xmath19 , then we can solve for @xmath20 and @xmath14 using the 15 and 22 ghz data at @xmath21-arcsec resolution , obtaining ( for the e hotspot ) @xmath22 hz@xmath23 , @xmath24 per cent : we would then expect the degree of polarization at 8 ghz to be essentially zero ( about @xmath25 per cent ) whereas in fact there is a detection of polarization in this region at the @xmath26 level ( table [ fltab ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic polarization @xmath14 obtained here is also somewhat low , which suggests that the model is not accurate even for the two higher frequencies .",
    "however , the value of @xmath20 , which is the critical quantity for estimating physical parameters , simply depends logarithmically on the ratio of the polarizations at the two frequencies , and so is unlikely to be grossly wrong . applying the model",
    ", we can see from the _ hst _ data , assuming a cylindrical symmetry , that @xmath27 kpc : this would imply @xmath28 m@xmath29 nt kpc@xmath2 .",
    "if we further assume a simple model in which the differences are due to varying orientations of the magnetic field in an approximately uniform - density ( though possibly low - filling - factor ) medium , then , dropping numerical factors of order unity , @xmath30 m@xmath29 nt kpc@xmath2 .",
    "( if there are in fact variations in @xmath31 , then the @xmath31 value derived from this equation is a weighted average . )    unfortunately , none of these three parameters , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath10 , is well constrained by existing observations .",
    "@xmath32 values of the order of 1 nt are energetically plausible from equipartition arguments , but this estimate is good to an order of magnitude at best . we know that @xmath33 kpc for the model above to be either necessary or applicable ; the fact that the degree of polarization of the hotspots continues to increase at higher radio resolutions ( table [ fltab ] ) suggests , however , that at least some structure is present on scales @xmath34 pc .",
    "the density is the most problematic quantity .",
    "clark et al .  ( 1998 ) suggested that the density in the emission - line clouds in the nuclear regions is @xmath35 cm@xmath29 , but were unable to make measurements near the hotspots .",
    "electron densities @xmath34 cm@xmath29 are often quoted for eelr .",
    "however , it is important to emphasise that it is probably _ not _ the line - emitting material itself that is depolarizing the radio source , if it has a density close to this value .",
    "baum & heckman ( 1989 ) estimate constraints on the density and mass of the extended line - emitting material in 3c171 , based on the observed h@xmath37 luminosity and assuming case b recombination : for a filling factor of unity , they estimate @xmath38 cm@xmath29 . to obtain a density @xmath34 cm@xmath29 , a filling factor of @xmath39",
    "would be required : in other words , if the line - emitting material has this density , it will have a very low covering fraction , and can not be responsible for depolarizing the radio source . for filling factors close to unity , a single - phase medium with a density close to the value given by baum & heckman can still just about explain the observations , requiring @xmath40 kpc for @xmath41 nt .",
    "however , if the eelr consists of dense ( @xmath34 cm@xmath29 ) , warm line - emitting clouds with a low filling factor , they can not be responsible for the observed depolarization .",
    "it must instead be due to a second phase of the ism .",
    "a plausible candidate is a second , hotter , more diffuse ionized phase , which would be expected to be present in shock - ionization models for the eelr : if the two phases are in approximate pressure equilibrium , then the density of the hot phase can be much lower than in the eelr clouds .",
    "if we take @xmath42 pc and @xmath43 nt , then the depolarization implies @xmath44 cm@xmath29 , which is a plausible density for the hot phase in the above scenario . for pressure balance with the colder , denser eelr clouds , that density would imply @xmath45 k :",
    "of course , we have no particular _ a priori _ reason to expect exact pressure balance in this dynamic situation .",
    "the non - detection of 3c171 in a deep _ rosat _ x - ray observation ( hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) sets quite strict limits on the properties of any hot gas in the system .",
    "i derive a @xmath46 upper limit on the absorbed _ rosat_-band ( 0.12.4-kev ) flux of the region of interest of @xmath47 ergs @xmath48 s@xmath2 .",
    "if we again assume cylindrical symmetry , with @xmath49 kpc and @xmath50 kpc , and consider a uniform medium , then fig.[nallow ] shows the constraints on gas density and temperature imposed by the x - ray limit together with the detection of depolarization .",
    "it can be seen that plasma of the temperature typically detected in the atmospheres of elliptical galaxies ( @xmath51 k ) can not be responsible for the depolarization : to avoid detection in the x - ray , its density would have to be low ( @xmath52  @xmath53 cm@xmath29 ) , implying scales @xmath54 kpc , which would be resolved by the radio data . this conclusion is valid so long as @xmath32 is not very much larger than 1 nt .",
    "the allowed region of parameter space in fig .",
    "[ nallow ] is more or less consistent , given the large uncertainties in all quantities involved ( the calculation is particularly uncertain at low temperatures ) , with the order of magnitude estimate of the temperature of the ` hot ' depolarizing medium given above : the x - ray data favour somewhat lower temperatures if @xmath55 cm@xmath29 , @xmath56 k. in the alternative scenario , involving a low - density eelr region , we expect @xmath57 k , which of course is entirely consistent with the x - ray upper limit .",
    "gas at temperatures around @xmath58 k can also in principle be detected in the optical via coronal emission lines ( e.g. graney & sarazin 1990 ) .",
    "if we adopt @xmath59 cm@xmath29 , then we can estimate upper limits on the temperature of the gas given the non - detection of any coronal lines in the spectra of clark et al .. graney & sarazin s results suggest that the most significant line for a plasma in ionization equilibrium ( not necessarily a good model for the material we are considering ! ) with @xmath60 k is the [ fe x ] 637.4 nm line .",
    "we derive an upper limit on the flux of this line from clark et al.s detection of [ o i ] at 636.3 nm , giving @xmath61 } \\la 4 \\times 10^{-16}$ ] ergs @xmath48 s@xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath59 cm@xmath29 , given our adopted geometry and the size of the extraction region of clark et al .",
    "we require the emissivity coefficient @xmath62 } \\la 3 \\times 10^{-27}$ ] ergs @xmath63 s@xmath2 . from figure 1 of graney & sarazin",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath64 k ; higher temperatures in the @xmath65@xmath66 k region would have given rise to detectable [ fe x ] emission in the optical spectra .",
    "thus the optical data , like the x - ray data , favour temperatures somewhat lower than @xmath58 k for the hot phase .",
    "again , this conclusion is sensitive to the choices of @xmath10 and @xmath32 , which determine the adopted value of @xmath31 .",
    "values of @xmath32 larger than 1 nt allow lower @xmath31 values and a hotter plasma .",
    "in addition , it is sensitive to the metallicity and ionization mechanism of the hot phase , which are unknown ; the key point here is simply to show that the presence of this phase is not ruled out by existing optical observations .    to summarize ,",
    "we are forced to one of two conclusions : either the eelr regions are very much less dense than the ` typical ' numbers quoted for @xmath67-k emission - line gas , and are distributed not in clumps but in a uniform screen across the source ; or , more probably , a second , less dense phase of the ism , with @xmath68 cm@xmath29 and a temperature likely to be around a few times @xmath69 k , is responsible for the depolarization .",
    "this second phase is plausibly shocked warm diffuse gas in the galaxy . in either case , the mass of the depolarizing medium , assuming it is cospatial with the eelr , would be @xmath70 m@xmath71 .",
