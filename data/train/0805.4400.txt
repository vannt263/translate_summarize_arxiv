    "various cosmological observations indicate that almost @xmath0 of the energy content of our universe is in some dark form that can only be detected through its gravitational effects .",
    "the standard explanation for this `` dark sector '' involves some kind of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , such as heavy weakly interacting particles or primordial black holes , and dark energy , which could be a manifestation of a cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) or some exotic matter field . this standard hybrid picture ( @xmath2 )",
    "has so far passed several different cosmological tests , and is dubbed the `` concordance model '' . despite of its successes , however , it is not without problems in accounting for structure on galactic scales  for example , the greatest challenge is to form bulge - free bright spiral galaxies and dwarf spiral galaxies .",
    "the galaxies in cdm have either a dominating stellar bulge or a dominating cdm cusp at the center . in essence",
    "lcdm over - predicts the dark - matter effects required by the empirical tully - fisher relation of spiral galaxies  and is in need of an experimental identification of the cdm particles with an understanding why the dark energy possesses its particular energy density .",
    "since dark energy affects cosmological models mainly via gravitational effects , it is possible to imagine that the effects of an explicit material source for the dark energy can be mimicked by a change in the behaviour of the gravitational field at late times .",
    "this is an unusual requirement since we have expected deviations from general relativity to arise in the high spacetime curvature limit at early times rather than in the low spacetime curvature limit at late times .",
    "however , we should note that the addition of an explicit cosmological constant to general relativity , as in the concordance model of @xmath2 , is already a particular example of such a low spacetime curvature correction .",
    "there have been many investigations of gravitational alternatives to dark energy carroll2005 , easson2004 , vollick2003 , brook , allemandi2004a , allemandi2004b , nojiri2005 , amar , nojiri2006 , and it appears that most of these attempts create different problems in either local gravitational systems or large - scale structure ( lss ) formation , or even both chiba2003 , erickcek2006 , navarro2007",

    "the situation is nonetheless different in the dark matter arena , where the leading modified gravity model , milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite , appeared more than two decades ago , but lacked a convincing general - relativistic formulation with a set of relativistic field equations that are applicable to cosmology .",
    "this hurdle has recently been overcome by bekenstein s tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) model @xcite which reduces to mond in the relevant limit .",
    "actually , what the teves model provides is more than a relativistic framework to investigate cosmology  it has been found that in teves the formation of lss , which was thought of as a problem for modified gravity theories before , could also be made consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , teves has also been shown to work well on smaller scales ( _ e.g. _ , mimicking cold dark matter in strong gravitational lensing systems @xcite , producing elliptical galaxies , barred spiral galaxies and even tidal dwarf galaxies @xcite , being consistent with solar system tests and so on ) and inherit the advantages of mond over the cdm model gnedin2002 ( _ e.g. _ , in explaining the tully - fisher law and galaxy rotation curves ) , this discovery attracts much interest on teves and its generalizations .",
    "also , since teves manages to grow large - scale structure using the growing mode of its vector field , this stimulates the investigation of vector - field cosmology @xcite in general tevesaether , ferreira2006 , zlosnik2007a , li2008c , tomi1 , fran , zhao2007 , skordis2008 , zhao2008 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , a very general vector - scalar field framework , the so - called dark fluid , is proposed which can reduce to many existing models in appropriate limits ) , and it is found that the lss in these theories could also be consistent with observations @xcite .    despite of this encouraging success , one should bear in mind that lss only provides one test of any structure formation model .",
    "in fact , the matter ( or galaxy ) power spectrum we observe today only reflects the large - scale matter - density perturbation _ today _ ( @xmath3 ) , rather than its evolutionary history .",
    "thus , even though the matter power spectrum , @xmath4 is compatible with observations , the evolution path of @xmath5 may well be different from that followed in the @xmath2 paradigm .",
    "this situation is shown particularly clearly in fig .",
    "3 ( lower panel ) of tevesvector , where the growth rate of baryon density perturbations is enhanced only at late times .",
    "the different evolution history of matter - density perturbations may have significant impacts on various other cosmological observables , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum , and influence the growth of nonlinear structure .",
    "we would like to determine what these impacts are .    in this paper",
    "we take a first step in that direction .",
    "we will concentrate on the influences of general modified gravity dark - matter models on cmb observables .",
    "our main assumption is that the modification to general relativity ( gr ) can be expressed as an _ effective dark matter _",
    "( edm ) term and moved to the right - hand side of the field equations so that the left - hand side is the same as in gr .",
    "this edm term , like the standard cdm , governs both the background and perturbation evolutions .",
    "this assumption is justified by observing the fact that in teves , as well as in the general vector - field ( or @xmath6 ) theories , the terms involving the vector field are essentially just the edm term described here .",
    "furthermore , we make some simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , any explicit dark energy is neglected .",
    "the main effects of dark energy ( if not too exotic in origin ) are to modify the background evolution at late times and cause the decay of the large - scale gravitational potential . neglecting it does not affect the essential features of our model but will simplify the numerics greatly .",
    "second , the background evolution is exactly the same as that in the standard cdm ( scdm ) model , which should also be a good approximation .",
    "third , the matter power spectrum , or equivalently @xmath3 , is the same as that of scdm , because any deviation from the latter should be stringently constrained by lss observations , and because both teves and @xmath6 models have claimed to reproduce the observed matter power spectrum .",
    "hence , we are fixing @xmath7 and investigating how different evolutions of @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the cosmic scale factor ) affect the cmb power spectrum .",
    "our theoretical framework is designed to be more general than is required for this purpose alone , and could be used to investigate features of other cosmological models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in   [ sect : model ] we set out the theoretical framework for our investigation and introduce more details of the cosmological model . in ",
    "[ sect : cmb ] we describe briefly how a general dark - matter component affects the cmb power spectrum and then , in   [ sect : numerics ] , supplement this discussion with a numerical example .",
    "we consider three special cases which span all the possibilities in the model , and explain them one by one .",
    "finally , in ",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] we provide a summary of our results together with some further discussion of the assumptions on which they are based .",
    "in this analysis we use the perturbed einstein equations in the covariant and gauge invariant ( cgi ) formalism .",
    "the cgi perturbation equations in general  - theories are derived in this section using the method of @xmath10 decomposition @xcite .",
    "first , we briefly review the main ingredients of @xmath10 decomposition and their application to standard general relativity @xcite for ease of later reference .",

    "the term @xmath90 is zero for radiation and baryons , but in general could be nonzero for the edm .",
    "again , we see that the stress history of the edm completely specifies the evolution of @xmath91 .",
    "as we shall see in what follows , the dark matter component influences the cmb power spectrum through the gravitational potential , and so the stress history of the edm is of crucial importance for the cmb .    in summary",
    ", we have seen that the properties of the ( isotropic and anisotropic ) stresses of the edm determine the evolution of the matter density perturbation and the gravitational potential , and thereby determine the predicted matter power spectrum ( through the former ) and the cmb spectrum ( through the latter ) @xcite . as we discussed in ",
    "sect : introduction , the predicted matter power spectrum of a theory records the matter energy density perturbation at a specific time  today , and it is easier to make it consistent with observations , as evident from the studies of teves and @xmath6 theories .",
    "thus , in this work we shall start from an edm theory which is constructed already to predict an acceptable matter power spectrum ; that is , we fix the matter energy density perturbation today and calculate the influence of different @xmath92 evolution paths on the cmb spectrum . in this way",
    "we can reduce our model space to one that is of realistic interests .",
    "it is helpful to have a brief review of the cmb physics and how it is affected by the dark matter before we go into the numerics to show the effects of edm stresses on the cmb . here",
    "we will just present a minimal description of this topic , for more details see the reviews @xcite .",
    "the primary cmb spectrum is determined by inhomogeneities in the cmb photon temperature at the time of recombination .",
    "prior to the recombination , photons couple tightly by thomson scattering with electrons which themselves couple to baryons via coulomb interaction , thus to a first approximation photons and baryons combine into a single fluid .",
    "dark matter , on the other hand , does not couple electromagnetically , but only interacts through gravitational effects and so contributes to the gravitational potential in which the baryon - photon fluid moves .",
    "when the density perturbation in the photons grows , hot ( cold ) spots appear where the local photon density is higher ( lower ) than average .",
    "the higher photon density means higher pressure , which will tend to counteract the growth of local photon density .",
    "this will lead to acoustic oscillations of the gauge invariant photon temperature perturbation @xmath93 , which is also a characterization of the photon number density perturbation . in reality",
    "this picture becomes a bit more complicated because of the interplay between baryons and dark matter : baryons couple tightly to photons , and move with them so that the inertia of the fluid is increased , while the gravitational potential produced by dark matter drives the oscillations .",
    "more specifically , if we use the multipole decomposition @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the legendre function and @xmath96 with @xmath97 being the direction of photon momentum , then in the tight - coupling limit the monopole @xmath98 satisfies a driven - oscillator equation @xcite : @xmath99 in which @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are , respectively , the ( frame - independent ) newtonian potential and curvature perturbations .",
    "the dipole moment @xmath103 , which equals the peculiar velocity of baryons thanks to the tight coupling , satisfies @xmath104 , and all higher moments @xmath105 vanish because the frequent scattering makes the photon distribution isotropic in the electron rest frame .",
    "thus , on large scales the photon temperature perturbation displays a pattern of driven and damped oscillation . on scales smaller than the photon mean free path , which itself grows in time , however , the tight coupling approximation is no longer perfect and quadrupole moments of the temperature perturbation needs to be taken into account .",
    "this introduces a dissipation term into the oscillator equation above , which damps the oscillations .    at the time of recombination",
    ", the number density of free electrons drops suddenly and there ceases to be coupling between baryons and photons .",
    "the cmb photons then free stream towards us .",
    "this free - streaming solution is given by @xcite @xmath106   \\notag \\\\ & & + ( 2\\ell+1)\\int_{\\tau_{\\ast}}^{\\tau_{0}}(\\psi^{\\prime}-\\phi^{\\prime})j_{% \\ell}[k(\\tau_{0}-\\tau)]d\\tau\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 are the conformal times today and at recombination , @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the spherical bessel function of order @xmath110 .",
    "the terms @xmath111 and @xmath103 are respectively the monopole and dipole moments of the cmb temperature field at @xmath112 and can be calculated using the equations above ( a @xmath113 is added to @xmath114 which accounts for the redshift in the photon energy , and thus temperature , when it climbs out of the newtonian potential ) .",
    "finally , the cmb temperature - temperature spectrum is defined as @xmath115    these are the leading - order effects in the cmb physics , and we could see how they affect the cmb power spectrum . because @xmath116 peaks strongly at @xmath117 , so perturbations on very large scales ( small @xmath50 ) mainly affect the low-@xmath110 spectrum . if the universe is completely dominated by matter at @xmath118 then the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freestreaming ] ) is given by @xmath119 and accounts for the ordinary sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect ; meanwhile , if the potential @xmath120 decays between @xmath118 and @xmath121 , then the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freestreaming ] ) will also make a significant contribution as photons travel in and out of many time - dependent potentials along the line of sight , and this is the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "going to higher @xmath110 one can see the peak structures of the cmb spectrum .",
    "the peaks appear since at @xmath118 , when the oscillating pattern of @xmath122 [ c.f .",
    "( [ eq : drivenoscillator ] ) ] freezes , @xmath98 might be just at its extrema for some scales ( @xmath50 ) ; and these extrema are then converted to extrema of @xmath123 through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : freestreaming ] , [ eq : cl ] ) . since what appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cl ] ) is @xmath124 , both the maxima and minima of @xmath125 will appear as peaks in @xmath123 .",
    "if there are no baryons and the potential @xmath113 is constant , then the even and odd peaks should be of the same amplitude .",
    "the inclusion of baryons effectively increases the inertia of the baryon - photon fluid and displaces the balance point of @xmath111 , and as a result , after taking @xmath126 the odd and even peaks appear to have different heights . at the same time , from eqs .",
    "( eq : freestreaming , [ eq : cl ] ) , we see that the dipole @xmath127 also contributes to @xmath123 through modulation .",
    "but eq .  ( eq : freestreaming ) shows that its power is more broadly distributed and so its contribution is significantly smaller than that of the monopole .",
    "where the monopole vanishes the dipole becomes important and this is why the troughs of @xmath123 are of nonzero amplitude .",
    "if one goes to still higher @xmath128 there are two effects .",
    "first , the higher @xmath110 moments mainly receive contributions from the small - scale ( large @xmath50 ) perturbations , which began oscillating already during the radiation - dominated era ( not much earlier than @xmath118 ) .",
    "since in the radiation era the potential @xmath129 decays , this decay will drive the monopole oscillation through the source term in eq .",
    "( eq : drivenoscillator ) and lead to an increase in the oscillation amplitudes .",
    "this explains why in some models the third peak is higher than the second .",
    "second , as discussed above , on very small scales there is severe damping of the oscillations because of photon diffusion .",
    "the combination of these two effects causes the cmb power in @xmath110s higher than the third peak to be significantly damped .",
    "we can now highlight the key places where the dark - matter effects enter cmb physics through the gravitational potential it produces and contrast the situation with that when edm is employed as a substitute .",
    "first , if cdm is replaced by edm , then in the analysis of   [ sect : model ] the time evolutions of @xmath130 and thus of @xmath129 and @xmath113 are modified .",
    "if the modification only becomes significant after @xmath118 , the isw effect could be different from standard cdm ( where it effectively vanishes ) .",
    "if it differs from standard cdm before @xmath118 then the sw effect will be altered as well .",
    "second , the deviation of @xmath129 and @xmath113 from their values in standard cdm before @xmath118 can change the zero point of the monopole oscillation through baryon loading , thereby modifying the relative heights of the odd and even peaks .",
    "third , the modification of @xmath131 and @xmath113 also changes the driving force in eq .",
    "( eq : drivenoscillator ) , and results in different amplitudes for the @xmath132 at high @xmath110 . in ",
    "[ sect : numerics ] we shall give some numerical examples showing these effects explicitly in our edm model .",
    "in this section we turn to some numerical examples to illustrate the qualitative analysis of   [ sect : cmb ] . as mentioned in   sect : model , we choose to fix the endpoint of the evolution of the matter energy density perturbation .",
    "this gives us a freedom to parametrize the evolution of @xmath133 , which is generally different from that of @xmath134 ( in matter regime ) .",
    "once the @xmath135 parametrization is given ( or in other words the model is set up ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolvedensityperturb ] ) becomes an evolution equation for @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "cross correlating isw with the galaxy distribution might help in this regard , but it is still limited for two reasons : first , it is contaminated by the effects of dark energy , and second , the cross - correlation data only exists for late times and can not effectively constrain models like ours where the deviation from cdm occurs much earlier .    if we choose the @xmath243 , which means that the deviation of edm from cdm starts before last scattering , then although eq .",
    "( eq : case3delta_pi ) guarantees that the @xmath91 evolution is not changed for arbitrary @xmath162 , the cmb power spectrum will generally be different from that of standard cdm because the quantities @xmath244 and @xmath193 , which are directly relevant for the primary cmb anisotropy , are modified since @xmath245 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure8 ] we present such an example , for which we have used the parametrization eq .",

    "if the evolution of @xmath81 prior to last scattering is significantly different from that of cdm , then the deviation of cmb spectrum might be very large , and this is why the cmb could efficiently constrain such alternative gravitational dark matter theories as teves and the @xmath6 models .",
    "another possible constraint comes from the cmb polarization .",
    "the linear polarization of cmb photons carries information about the gravitational potential because it can only be generated from the quadrupole moment of the cmb temperature perturbation , which is related to the anisotropic photon stress @xcite , through thomson scattering .",
    "furthermore , at earlier times the rapid scattering of photons by electrons ruins the photon anisotropic stress ( c.f .  ",
    "[ sect : cmb ] ) , consequently the polarization only appear close to last scattering when significant photon quadrupole anisotropy can be produced .",
    "the localization of the generation in time , and the dependence on the quadrupole moment , only mean that the polarization directly reflects the gravitational potentials at the time of last scattering in a special way and so provides invaluable information about the edm .",
    "this is in contrast to the cmb temperature spectrum which depends on the gravitational potentials through the whole cosmic history up to now , and also on the photon monopole and dipole moments , which complicate the extraction of information . in fig .",

    "the cmb polarization was first detected in 2002 @xcite , with the precision gradually improved since then @xcite .",
    "although the precision at present is still insufficient to place stringent constraints on the edm model , we expect that future observations will change this situation",
    ".    we could also slightly change eq .",
    "( [ eq : case3delta_pi ] ) to make the evolution of @xmath244 _ or _",
    "@xmath193 the same as that for standard cdm , however clearly this is not possible for _ both _",
    "@xmath244 _ and _ @xmath193 because in this case @xmath247 .",
    "because the primary cmb anisotropy is determined by both of these two variables , it will almost definitely differ between the edm and cdm models .",
    "furthermore , in the most general cases the evolution of @xmath91 will be changed as well , which gives rise to different low-@xmath195 cmb spectra .",
    "therefore , we expect that the cmb data will place stringent constraints on the general edm models , and can be used to distinguish alternative gravitational theories of dark matter .",
    "conversely , any attempt of modification of general relativity which claims to have reproduced the observed large scale structure must be confronted with the cmb fluctuation spectrum and polarization to test its viability .",
    "motivated by the recent developments in producing the large - scale structure formation with alternative theories of gravity , we have considered the prospect of using the cmb to constrain such theories in new ways .",
    "we take the confrontation with the matter power spectrum data as a first test of the perturbed cosmological model in our alternative gravity theory and assume that this test has been passed .",
    "this is because the currently successful theories like teves and @xmath6 really are _ only _ able to reproduce the observed lss rather than all the perturbation observables , and such a simplifying assumption efficiently restricts our model space so that the degeneracy problem is somewhat alleviated . as discussed in ",
    "sect : model , reproducing the observed lss is a rather weak requirement on the theory because the lss only reflects the density perturbations at late time .",
    "this means that there is still considerable freedom to choose the evolution history of the dark - matter density perturbation @xmath81 , which will generally lead to different predictions about other cosmological observables such as the cmb spectra and polarization .",
    "we discussed how this freedom in the evolution history can be utilized by considering an example of the parametrization [ c.f .",

    "[ sect : model ] , the evolution of @xmath249 is completely governed by the edm stress history , which we quantify using the two variables @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "this implies that the cmb is an ideal test bed for edm models . in reality",

    "( eq : evolvedensityperturb ) becomes a single equation for the two variables @xmath250 and @xmath137 , so , in ",
    "[ sect : numerics ] , we considered three separate cases : ( i ) @xmath251 , ( ii ) @xmath252 and ( iii ) @xmath253 . for simplicity , we have also made the following assumptions : ( 1 ) the evolution of @xmath141 is scale independent , as is implied by the observed lss , ( 2 ) the cosmological constant ( or other form of explicit dark energy violating the strong energy condition ) is neglected to simplify the numerics , ( 3 ) the edm equation of state parameter , @xmath254 is assumed to be small enough so that we can assume the standard cdm background evolution holds ; and , ( 4 ) only adiabatic initial conditions , a scale - independent @xmath255 primordial power spectrum , and effectively massless neutrinos are considered ( we will return to these assumptions below ) .",
    "for case i , the standard cdm relation @xmath256 still holds but the evolution of these potentials could be changed .",
    "if the deviation of edm from cdm only occurs after the last scattering , then this change in @xmath84 mainly modifies the isw effect and , hence , the low-@xmath110 cmb power . if the edm starts to deviate from cdm before last scattering , however",
    ", then the early changes in @xmath113 and @xmath129 would modify the cmb acoustic peak features in a complicated manner , as we described qualitatively in ",
    "sect : cmb and   [ subsect : case1 ] .",
    "the evolution of @xmath136 can be understood qualitatively : since the effect of the pressure perturbation is to counteract gravitational collapse , in order that @xmath257 grows faster than @xmath163 we need a negative @xmath258 and vice versa ( c.f .  fig .  [",
    "fig : figure7 ] ) .",
    "the case ii evolution is problematic as long as we stick to the above simplifying assumption ( 1 ) , _ i.e. _ , requiring a scale - independent growth of @xmath141 , because in this case eq .  ( eq : evolvedensityperturb ) implies a scale _ dependent _ @xmath137 ( @xmath259 is independent of @xmath50 ) , which diverges on large scales ( small @xmath50 ) . as we have seen in   [ subsect : case2 ] , this leads to a strong late - isw effect , blowing up the low-@xmath110 cmb spectrum even if the edm only differs slightly from standard cdm .",
    "furthermore , a natural edm model with @xmath204 and @xmath260 does not exist in the literature , and this model is different from of case i , which arises naturally in @xmath6 models with @xmath261 .    of course , the most general situation is our case iii , where both @xmath262 and @xmath137 are nonzero .",
    "needless to say , this generality also makes its exploration more difficult .",
    "one could , however , use the extra degree of freedom here in model constructions .",
    "if we fix _ both _ the evolution of @xmath133 _ and _ that of the potential @xmath263 , then @xmath137 and @xmath136 can be solved uniquely at the same time .",
    "such a construction has the advantage that we can fix the evolution of @xmath84 to be identical to that in standard cdm so that the isw effect is not changed at all . if the deviation of edm starts after last scattering , then such a model is degenerate with standard cdm even after cmb and lss data are taken into account , and furthermore the cmb - galaxy cross correlation data is inefficient in constraining it .",
    "allowing edm to deviate before last scattering , however , will almost surely predict different cmb peak features , because in this case @xmath264 and the acoustic oscillations of photon - baryon fluid are changed with respect to standard cdm ( c.f .  ",
    "[ sect : cmb ] ) . dropping the requirement on the evolution of @xmath84",
    "makes the situation even worse , because in this case the isw effect and low-@xmath110 structure of the cmb spectrum are also changed .",
    "we stress that the cmb polarization also provides invaluable information for constraining edm models , because it depends only on the quadrupole moment of the photon temperature perturbation @xmath93 ( the photon anisotropic stress ) , and thus only on the physics close to the time of last scattering .    throughout this paper",
    "we have chosen to parametrize @xmath265 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : edmparametrization ] ) .",
    "this is fairly simple and sufficient for our purposes as we only aim to show the importance of cmb data in constraining alternative gravitational dark matter theories , but not to constrain any specified model or given parametrization exactly .",
    "there are good reasons why more detailed parametrizations are needed for more precise future studies .",
    "first , although @xmath266 is a good approximation in the matter - dominated epoch , it breaks down when the contribution from radiation is still significant ( including the time prior to and around last scattering ) and when a cosmological constant is included .",
    "second , because the physics at the time of matter - radiation equality is relevant for edm models which deviate from cdm earlier , we sometimes need to choose @xmath152 to be smaller than the matter - radiation equality @xmath267 , which means that the evolution of @xmath133 or @xmath268 can not be completely scale independent ( remember that @xmath269 is relevant for the bending of the matter power spectrum @xcite ) . thus , future precise calculations , particularly those relevant for weak lensing and the galaxy - isw cross correlation , should use parametrizations which reduce exactly to @xmath248 in the @xmath1cdm model in appropriate limits .    notice that our logic here is different from other related considerations of generalized dark matter ( gdm ) @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , the author parametrizes the stress sector of the gdm with three quantities , @xmath270 and @xmath271 , which respectively characterize the eos , pressure perturbation , and anisotropic stress of the gdm",
    ". the gdm effects on the cmb _ and _ matter power spectra are then studied by assuming some specific values of these quantities .",
    "our approach tackles the problem from a different direction and is therefore complementary to those earlier works .",
    "one interesting issue is the inclusion of hot dark matter , which is needed by teves itself .",
    "this can certainly be achieved by setting special values for @xmath270 and @xmath271 as in @xcite . in our approach",
    "we simply treat the edm as a `` black box '' which is completely controlled by separate conservation equations . by parametrizing @xmath272",
    "we are able to extract information on the pressure perturbation @xmath136 and anisotropic stress @xmath137 from these conservation equations without knowing exactly what is in the box  it can be mixtures of modified gravitational effects and neutrinos , or something else entirely .",
    "the other issue is related to the initial conditions . in this work we mainly focus on the adiabatic initial conditions as in @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the adiabatic initial condition is far from the only possibility , and there can be four regular isocurvature modes bucher2000 .",
    "these isocurvature modes are predicted by many theoretical models and may even correlate with the adiabatic one .",
    "in contrast to the adiabatic mode , the isocurvature mode excites sinusoidal oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid and so predicts the first cmb acoustic peak to be around @xmath273 rather than @xmath274 ; consequently a pure or dominating isocurvature initial condition is incompatible with basic cmb observations .",
    "nonetheless , a subdominant contribution from isocurvature initial conditions actually degenerates with other cosmological parameters and can not be ruled out by the current data @xcite . in our edm model , if the edm evolves differently from cdm early in the radiation era , then @xmath141 does not evolve adiabatically and the entropy perturbation @xmath275 is nonzero . in this case",
    ", one might naturally expect that there should be isocurvature modes in the initial conditions .",
    "a detailed calculation of the consequences of introducing such modes , however , generally requires thorough searches of the new parameter space ( which is enlarged compared to the standard case because now the amplitude , tilt of the isocurvature modes and their correlation with the adiabatic mode must be taken as free parameters ) like in trotta2001 , amendola2002 , beltran2004 , keskitalo2007 and is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "( eq : edmparametrization ) ] should be scale dependent for the same reasons as discussed above . in this work",
    "we adopt a more conservative approach by assuming that the edm evolves like standard cdm at earlier times and so adiabaticity is a natural choice .    in conclusion , we propose ways to use the cmb in order to constrain those alternative gravity theories for dark matter which claim to be compatible with  the observed lss .",
    "we find that the cmb temperature and polarization spectra are good discriminators between these theories in general , especially when they deviate from the cdm paradigm before last scattering .",
    "if the deviation starts after last scattering , however , there can exist edm theories which are degenerate with respect to the standard @xmath1cdm model and can not be distinguished by cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "this point is particularly interesting from the viewpoint of model constructions .",
    "our results also indicate that the stress properties of dark matter , which determine the evolutions of both density perturbations and gravitational potential , can be studied and significantly constrained with existing and future data by using just the general conservation equations and without specialising to any specific theoretical model .    we thank david spergel for helpful discussions .",
