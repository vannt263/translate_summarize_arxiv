    "for dealing with some physical problems , we need to take the discrete fourier transform .",
    "especially , many physical problems are defined on lattice models . in such a case ,",
    "we may face to the problem of fourier transforming a function defined on the lattice to the corresponding reciprocal space . for most of the problems , the function to be transformed can not be expressed analytically but given numerically .",
    "when the function needs to be given at a large number of discrete points within the region it is defined , the memory volume for storing the function may be too big and may even exceed the computer s storage limit .",
    "even if the problem is within the computer s capability , when the transform is involved in an integral equation that may be solved by iterations , the function needs to be determined again and again in the iterations and the process is very time consuming .",
    "therefore , an approximation scheme for the discrete fourier transform that reduces the storage requirement and accelerates the numerical computation process without loosing the accuracy is very desirable .",
    "the discrete fourier transform as well as a continuous one is useful in solving the integral equations with convolutions involved .",
    "one of the examples in the quantum many - body problems is to calculate the self - energy @xmath0 of electrons @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the momentum of electron , @xmath3 with @xmath4 an integer is the fermionic matsubara frequency , @xmath5 is temperature , @xmath6 is the volume of the system , @xmath7 is an effective interaction between electrons , and @xmath8 is the green s function of electrons . in a sophisticated scheme , @xmath0 and @xmath8",
    "need to be determined self - consistently .",
    "after the fourier transforms , in real coordinate @xmath9 and imaginary time @xmath10 space , eq .",
    "( [ ise ] ) reads @xmath11 having @xmath12 been simply calculated by eq .",
    "( [ ise2 ] ) , one then obtains @xmath13 by the inverse fourier transforms .    earlier works dealt with eq .",
    "( [ ise ] ) by direct summation over the matsumara frequencies . in order to reduce the memory storage requirement and accelerate the computation process ,",
    "pao and bickers developed a renormalization - group computation method @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the assumption that the green s function depends approximately on @xmath5 only through the matsubara frequency .",
    "the computation starts at high temperature @xmath14 to solve the equations of the green s function at selected numbers @xmath15 with cutoff @xmath16 for the matsubara frequencies . since the green s function decreases with matsubara frequency very fast at high temperature ,",
    "the selected numbers is not necessarily too many .",
    "then at lower temperature @xmath17 , the selected numbers correspond to lower frequencies .",
    "the equations for the functions at these lower frequencies are solved and the functions at some high frequencies @xmath18 are approximated as the ones calculated at @xmath14 .",
    "for example , @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the selected number",
    ". the series summation in eq . ( [ ise ] ) is carried out using the staircase rule .",
    "that is , summation of @xmath22 over the range @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the any two nearest - neighbor selected numbers is given by @xmath26 . by repeating this sequence , the equations for determining the green s function are so solved at lower temperatures .",
    "the key problem in solving such integral equations by the direct summation treatment is how to accurately take the series summation with the selected numbers . for numerically computing the series summation ,",
    "@xmath27 the present author has introduced an algorithm that sums over selected numbers with corresponding weights .",
    "the basic idea of this method is described as following .",
    "suppose @xmath28 as a function of continuously variable @xmath29 is locally smooth . between the selected numbers @xmath24 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 an integer ,",
    "@xmath22 can be expanded as @xmath33 where the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 are determined by the function values @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( the midpoint between @xmath24 and @xmath30 also selected ) and @xmath38 .",
    "they are given by @xmath39/2h , \\label{c1}\\\\ c_2 & = & [   f(n_1)-2f(n_2 ) + f(n_3)]/2h^2 .",
    "\\label{c2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then using the results , @xmath40 the summation of @xmath22 over the range @xmath41 is obtained approximately in terms of @xmath42 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38 the values of @xmath28 all at the selected points ; the coefficients attached respectively to these values are the corresponding weights depending only on @xmath32 . by repeating this procedure to a large cutoff number , the summation in eq .",
    "( [ ism ] ) is then obtained .",
    "the algorithm is proved to be very accurate .    though the convolution with the discrete numbers can be treated as series summation , numerical computation with the discrete fourier transform",
    "is much easier .",
    "it is even faster provided the transform is performed using a high efficiency algorithm . in this work , we will develop an algorithm to the discrete fourier transform . the accuracy and efficiency of the new algorithm",
    "will be justified with examples .    in the later part of this paper",
    ", we will apply the algorithm to the physical problem studying three - dimensional interacting electron gas ( 3deg ) under the renormalized - ring - diagram approximation ( rrda ) @xcite and compare the ground - state energy so obtained with existing results of the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite and the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "rrda satisfies the microscopic conservation laws @xcite .",
    "it has not so far been applied to 3deg because of the numerical difficulty in self - consistently solving the integral equations determining the green s function .",
    "we here consider the discrete fourier transform @xmath43 where @xmath44 is defined in the range @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 being integer numbers and @xmath2 is a real parameter in the range @xmath48 . to find out an approximation for it , we firstly analyze the following summation in small range @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath24 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 all integers , @xmath51 for large @xmath2 , since @xmath52 is a rapid oscillating factor , @xmath53 can not be regarded as a smooth function of @xmath54 and the previous algorithm can not be applied here .",

    "equation ( [ tsum1 ] ) is valid when the function @xmath55 is smooth in each segment ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) .",
    "as shown above , only in each of these segments , @xmath55 is approximated as a parabolic function and then the summation over the terms with the oscillating exponential factor is performed exactly . by separating the whole range @xmath85 into several pieces with different strides according to the behavior of the function and using the summation rule given above in each piece ,",
    "we then obtain the discrete fourier transform .",
    "this reduces greatly the memory storage and enhances the computation efficiency .",
    "here is a remark : except for the number of the selected points is odd in each piece , there is no constraint on the numbers of values of the input function @xmath28 and the output results and no constraint on the relation between the stride of @xmath2 and the total number of the selected points @xmath86 , which is different from the condition of the fast fourier transform .",

    "the contribution from the remaining term of @xmath103 is @xmath104 . according to the summation rule , instead of summing term by term within the cutoff , summation in eq .",
    "( [ ex11 ] ) is taken over only selected numbers .",
