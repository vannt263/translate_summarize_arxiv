    "in experiments on ultracold trapped fermi gases , there are many situations where the system is out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the first one is of course the trapping and cooling stage , i.e. , before the system has reached its equilibrium state which is usually the starting point for the actual experiment .",
    "then , in some experiments the system is excited in order to observe its dynamical behavior .",
    "for instance , many experiments studied collective oscillations of the system @xcite , another example being a recent experiment at mit where the collision of two atom clouds ( both in equilibrium ) was studied @xcite . finally , often the system is not imaged directly during the experiment , but only after the trap was switched off and the system has expanded for a certain time , in order to increase its size",
    ".    the modeling of such time - dependent processes from the theoretical point of view can be quite complicated . for practical reasons ,",
    "only semiclassical approaches are suitable for the description of time - dependent phenomena involving typically several @xmath0 atoms in a three - dimensional , non - uniform geometry . in some cases , it is possible to use hydrodynamic approaches : superfluid hydrodynamics describes the expansion @xcite and the collective modes @xcite of superfluid systems at zero temperature .",
    "hydrodynamics is also applicable in the normal - fluid phase if the mean time between collisions is much shorter than all other time scales of the process under consideration , so that the system can always be considered to be in a local equilibrium @xcite .",
    "superfluid and normal hydrodynamics can be combined to two - fluid hydrodynamics in order to describe superfluid systems at finite temperature @xcite . however , in many cases hydrodynamic approaches are not sufficient . in all cases where it is important that even locally the distribution @xmath1 of the atoms is not an equilibrium one , the boltzmann equation allows a very general description , provided the system is in the normal phase .",
    "if the system is superfluid , a more elaborate theory is necessary which couples the dynamics of the quasiparticle distribution function to the dynamics of the superfluid order parameter @xcite .    in the past , several authors used the boltzmann equation for the investigation of collective oscillations in normal - fluid trapped fermi gases @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the boltzmann equation was not solved directly in order to find the distribution function @xmath2 , but semi - analytical approximate solutions were found by using the scaling ansatz @xcite or the method of moments @xcite .",
    "these methods rely explicitly or implicitly on the assumption that the collision term can be treated in the relaxation - time approximation , with a single relaxation time @xmath3 which is independent of the position in the trap .",
    "an exception is the work by toschi et al .",
    "@xcite , where the boltzmann equation was solved numerically , using a test - particle method very similar to the one we are using here .",
    "the test - particle method for the solution of the boltzmann equation has been used for many years in nuclear physics for the simulation of heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in the context of trapped atoms ,",
    "it was also used for the simulation of the dynamics of the thermal cloud in a bose - einstein condensate @xcite and ( without collision term ) of the normal - fluid component in a superfluid fermi gas @xcite .    for the collision term of the boltzmann equation ,",
    "it is important to know the cross section which in principle can be modfied by in - medium effects . in the work by riedl et al .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that by using in the boltzmann equation instead of the free cross - section the in - medium one , the agreement between theoretical and experimental frequencies and damping rates of different collective modes is deteriorated .",
    "the reason is that the in - medium cross section is larger than the free one , so that the relaxation time is dramatically reduced . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "our aim was to include in addition to the in - medium cross section medium effects into the mean - field potential .",
    "this mean field resulted in better density profiles and allowed us to understand the shift of the quadrupole frequency in the collisionless regime at very low temperature observed in @xcite .",
    "however , it did not help to improve the agreement between theory and experiment in the region of higher temperatures , where the properties of the collective modes are completely dominated by collisions .",
    "hence , one of our motivations for the present work was to check the validity of the relaxation - time approximation which is implicitly made in the method of moments . here we will restrict ourselves to the case without mean field and with the free cross section .",
    "as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : modes ] , the numerical solution of the boltzmann equation gives indeed a significantly longer relaxation time than the method of moments .",
    "as we will show , this discrepancy is due to the restriction of the method of moments to second - order moments in the existing literature @xcite .",
    "once fourth - order moments are included , the results of the method of moments and of the numerical solution are in good agreement . however , already in the simplest case of a spherical harmonic trap without mean field , the inclusion of fourth - order moments is a very tedious task , while the numerical method can be generalized to more realistic cases .",
    "in addition , there are some other reasons why we felt the necessity for a numerical method . for example , there are damping effects due to the anharmonicity of the trap potential which can not be described by the method of moments .",
    "another advantage of the numerical method is that it offers the possibility to simulate not only the oscillation of the cloud , but also the subsequent expansion after the trap has been switched off .    in sec . [",
    "sec : numericaldescription ] of the present paper , we give a detailed description of the method .",
    "in particular , we explain in detail how the collisions are simulated , since our method is somewhat different from that of ref .",
    "moreover we discuss some tests we made in order to estimate up to which precision we can trust our simulation .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : modes ] , we come to the main point of our article and calculate the properties of some collective modes for a system in a spherical harmonic trap . while the sloshing and breathing modes are rather trivial , the frequency and damping rate of the quadrupole mode are very sensitive to the collisions . we compare the numerical results with those of the method of moments . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize and give an outlook to future studies .",
    "throughout the paper , we will use units with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 reduced planck constant , @xmath6 = boltzmann constant ) .",
    "the strength of the interaction is characterized by the dimensionless quantity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the scattering length . concerning the fermi momentum @xmath9 and the fermi energy @xmath10 we follow the usual convention that these quantities are defined by the corresponding ones of an ideal fermi gas at zero temperature , i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the atomic mass , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of atoms and @xmath15 the trap frequency .",

    "the statistical fluctuations are of the order of @xmath42 , i.e. , the first condition is equivalent to @xmath43 the second condition implies of course that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the thomas - fermi radius and the fermi momentum , respectively , but this is not always sufficient . at low - temperature ,",
    "it is crucial to resolve the rapid change of the distribution function around the fermi surface , i.e. , @xmath48 in practice , as the computation time increases as @xmath49 , it turns out that the conditions ( [ conditionn ] ) and ( [ conditiont ] ) can not simultaneously be satisfied at too low temperatures .      in the absence of collisions ,",
    "the numerical task consists only in solving simultaneously the classical equations of motion ( [ eq : eqmotion ] ) for the @xmath30 test particles .",
    "we do this by using the velocity verlet algorithm @xcite , which contrary to the original verlet algorithm @xcite uses the positions @xmath50 and velocities @xmath51 as starting point for the time step from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the propagation from @xmath52 to @xmath54 is done according to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the acceleration of the @xmath36-th test particle .",
    "if it is written in this way , it is obvious that the velocity verlet algorithm is identical to the leap - frog algorithm @xcite .",
    "note that the accelerations @xmath57 can be reused in the next time step , so that the algorithm needs only one evaluation of the acceleration per time step , but nevertheless its global error is of the order @xmath58 .",

    "we assume that the system is initially in equilibrium .    a suitable equilibrium distribution is given by the distribution function within the thomas - fermi or local - density approximation ( lda ) , @xmath94 since it is a stationary solution of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",

    "let us see what happens if we switch off the pauli blocking in the simulation of the collision term .",
    "in this case , already after a relatively short time @xmath119 , the distribution in the numerical simulation ( empty circles ) has converged to a boltzmann distribution with the same number of atoms and total energy ( dashed line ) .",
    "so , the stability of the fermi distribution in our full simulation shows clearly that pauli blocking is correctly implemented .",
    "the small deviations from the ideal fermi distribution are a consequence of the fact that with the chosen widths of the gaussians ( @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) , the condition ( [ conditiont ] ) is not well satisfied at @xmath110 .",
    "when we did the same kind of comparison at higher temperatures , we found that the agreement between the simulation and the fermi distribution improves : at @xmath120 , it is already perfect .",

    "below that temperature , the collision rate in the simulation with pauli blocking gradually becomes too high since the finite widths of the gaussians ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) do not satisfy any more the condition ( [ conditiont ] ) and act in the pauli - blocking factors like an enhanced temperature . in the rest of this paper , we will therefore restrict ourselves to temperatures above @xmath129 .",
    "near unitarity ( @xmath130 ) , we consider only temperatures above @xmath131 because this is close to the superfluid transition temperature at unitarity @xcite . as it can be seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : collrate ] , the agreement between the collision rate obtained in the simulation and the exact one is satisfactory in the temperature range considered .",
    "the agreement is not as good as for @xmath132 at high temperature because of the larger cross section which leads to collisions between test particles which are further apart .",
    "the sloshing mode is an oscillation of the center of mass of the system .",
    "it plays a special role because in a harmonic trap it is undamped and its frequency is equal to that of the trap , independently of the number of atoms , of the temperature , and of the interaction between the atoms ( kohn mode @xcite ) .",
    "this is why it is often used for the experimental determination of the trap frequency @xcite . within the test - particle method ,",
    "this general theorem is satisfied and it is easy to see why :    let us first neglect collisions . from the equations of motion of the individual test particles in the harmonic potential ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) ,",
    "@xmath133 it is evident that the averages @xmath134 and @xmath135 obey analogous equations of motion , @xmath136 let us now consider the effect of a collision of two test particles . of course , the trajectories of the colliding test particles will not obey any more the original equations of motion ( [ eq : eqmotionharmonic ] ) , but the collision has absolutely no effect on the averages : since the positions do not change during the collision , @xmath134 remains unchanged , and since the total momentum of the two colliding test particles is conserved , the average @xmath135 is not changed either .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the existing literature @xcite , the method of moments was limited to second - order moments , as described in appendix [ app : mmresp ] . however , as we have seen above , this implies that the system is characterized by a single relaxation time @xmath3 , whereas in the spirit of a local - density approximation one would expect that in a trapped system the relaxation time should be position - dependent , @xmath208 .",
    "for instance , one could imagine that the gas in the center of the trap is more or less hydrodynamic ( short relaxation time ) , whereas far away from the trap center it gets very dilute and hence collisionless ( long relaxation time ) . in the case of the quadrupole mode",
    ", this means that the fermi - surface deformation is stronger at larger radii than in the trap center .",
    "it seems therefore natural to include into the ansatz for the perturbed distribution function in addition to the standard term @xmath209 describing the fermi - surface deformation , a term @xmath210 .",
    "more generally speaking , we should go beyond the standard approximation to include only second - order moments , and include also fourth - order ( or perhaps even higher ) moments .",
    "the task of extending the method of moments to the next higher order is in principle straight - forward but in practice very tedious : in the case of the quadrupole mode , the number of moments is increased from three to twelve .",

    "nevertheless the inverse relaxation time is too small . from this one",

    "this effective relaxation time agrees very well with the one of the simulation so that both results give very similar frequency and damping .",
    "however , from a theoretical point of view , the definition of these quantities should come from the zeroes of the determinant of the matrix @xmath219 defined in appendix [ app : fourthorder ] .",
    "such a discussion is postponed to a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we presented a test - particle method for solving numerically the boltzmann equation for trapped fermi gases .",
    "while such methods have been popular in other fields of physics for many years , there have been only a few applications to ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "our method is similar to that of refs .",
    "@xcite with some differences in the treatment of the collision term . in order to compute the occupation numbers in the pauli - blocking factors in the collision term",
    ", we represent each test particle by a gaussian in @xmath98 and @xmath63 space .",
    "the minimum value of the width of the gaussian is dictated by the statistical fluctuations due to the finite number of test particles , limiting the applicability of the method to temperatures above @xmath220 .",
    "as a first application of the method we discussed some collective modes . for simplicity , we considered only toy systems consisting of @xmath221 atoms in a spherical harmonic trap and neglected the mean - field potential and medium modifications of the cross section .",
    "as expected , the sloshing and monopole modes are undamped and independent of the collisions .",
    "in contrast , the quadrupole mode is very sensitive to collisions . in the hydrodynamic limit",
    ", its frequency should approach @xmath222 , while it is @xmath147 in the collisionless limit . in our simulations , we never reach the hydrodynamic regime , but the collisionless regime can be realized at high temperature due to the diluteness of the gas .    surprisingly , the frequency and damping rate of the quadrupole mode obtained within the numerical simulation are quite different from those obtained within the widely used method of moments including moments up to second order in @xmath98 and @xmath63 .",
    "the method of moments predicts a relaxation time @xmath3 which is significantly shorter than the one obtained within the simulation .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath98 dependence of the relaxation time is neglected if only the @xmath223 moment is taken into account for the description of the fermi - surface deformation .",
    "we have shown that if the method of moments is extended to moments up to fourth order in @xmath98 and @xmath63 , e.g. , the @xmath224 moment , the agreement with the simulation becomes very good .",
    "the focus of the present paper was mainly to explain the test - particle method and to show its usefulness .",
    "for instance , the deficiency of the method of moments up to second order would not have been detected without the comparison with the numerical result . in future studies",
    ", we plan to apply the method to more realistic cases .",
    "in particular , in order to reach the typical numbers of atoms in the experiments , we will have to increase @xmath14 by a factor of @xmath225 .",
    "however , this should not pose a big problem : according to eq .",
    "( [ conditiont ] ) , if we increase @xmath14 but keep the ratio @xmath226 fixed , the widths @xmath38 and @xmath39 may be chosen larger ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( [ conditionn ] ) stays satisfied with the same number of test particles , @xmath30 , i.e. , with a reduced ratio @xmath228 .",
    "the computation time will only grow because of the increased collision rate ( due to the larger test - particle cross section @xmath229 ) .",
    "another point is the trap geometry .",
    "the traps in the experiments are usually not spherical , but elongated .",
    "concerning the propagation of the test particles , this does not cause any difficulty , but in the calculation of the occupation numbers , it will probably be necessary to replace the width @xmath38 of the gaussian in @xmath98 space by different widths @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 in the three space directions .",
    "another important advantage of the numerical method is that an anharmonicity of the trap potential , which is always present in real experiments , can easily be included .",
    "finally , the mean field @xcite and medium modifications of the cross section @xcite should be included .",
    "the mean field , which originally depends on the chemical potential @xmath96 and the temperature @xmath97 , can be expressed as a function of the local density and energy density , which are both obtainable in the simulation . however , as shown previously @xcite , the mean field is not just proportional to the density : this leads to a huge numerical effort which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the in - medium cross section is also difficult to be included because it depends on too many variables to be tabulated : @xmath233 .",
    "one possible solution of this problem is to replace the full @xmath234 and @xmath235 dependence of the in - medium cross section by a simple parametrization which results in the same local relaxation time @xmath236 .",
    "work in this direction is already in progress . in refs .",
    "@xcite , within the method of moments up to second order , the use of the in - medium cross section spoiled the agreement with experimental data because the resulting relaxation times were too short .",
    "since the present work shows that the numerical simulation gives a longer relaxation time than the method of moments , we hope that this problem can be solved .",
    "further important extensions of the present work are the generalization to polarized fermi gases and to superfluid systems .",
    "these questions , however , require more fundamental theoretical studies before they can be tackled numerically .",
    "replacing the distribution functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : collrate ] ) by equilibrium distribution functions @xmath237 , one obtains after some algebra the equilibrium collision rate @xmath238 where @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
