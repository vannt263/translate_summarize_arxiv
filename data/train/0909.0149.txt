    "approximation in the form of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence is quite crude for describing many geophysical applications . usually , there are two reasons why this approximation can be violated",
    ". one of them is a rapid daily rotation characterized by a small rossby number , @xmath0 .",
    "this case is typical for problems of meteorology and physics of the ocean where its influence is principal @xcite .",
    "however , the most critical regime with an extremely small rossby number occurs in the liquid planetary cores .",
    "there , the coriolis force is three orders of magnitude larger than the nonlinear term , which changes the balance of the forces in the navier - stokes equation and the spectral properties of turbulence for large reynolds numbers , @xmath1 .",
    "another source of anisotropy of convection in the liquid core is a strong magnetic field which , in combination with rotation , leads to the plate - like structure of convective patterns @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider the former source of anisotropy related to rapid rotation .",
    "the introduction of rotation leads to substantial rearranging of the flow , both in the physical and in the wave spaces . in spite of this , the coriolis force itself",
    "does not produce work .",
    "it can redistribute the energy between the scales and lead to inverse cascades , which is known in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) as an increase of the kinetic energy on large scales @xcite predicted in the renormalization group theory @xcite . as a result , the slope of the spectrum of the kinetic energy changes from @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this change is closely related to the break of the energy transfer over the spectrum @xcite .",
    "let us proceed to the thermal convection problem , when an additional equation of heat transfer leads to the transformation of cellular convection to the cyclonic convection .",
    "this problem has been studied thoroughly in the pioneering works on thermal convection @xcite , as well as in later papers on the geodynamo , see @xcite for references .",
    "it appears that rapid rotation causes a new kind of balance between pressure and the coriolis force ( geostrophic balance ) @xcite : @xmath4 , which leads to small gradients along the axis of rotation @xmath5 : @xmath6  . as a result",
    ", cyclones and anticyclones prolonged along @xmath5 of a small diameter appear .",
    "if one takes the parameters of the earth s liquid core and decreases the amplitude of the heating sources to the onset of convection , the diameter of cyclones will then be @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the ekman number and @xmath9 is the height of the cyclone . in reality , the heat sources are quite larger , and there is a wave packet of such cyclones .",
    "however , estimates of the order of the energy indicates that , at least for the first 3 - 4 orders of the wave number @xmath10 , geostrophic balance takes place .",
    "this exceeds the extent of geomagnetic spectra and should be taken into account in geodynamo models .",
    "this was already started in the development of the full tensor approach to anisotropic viscosity @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite and estimates of the anisotropy of heat mass transfer @xcite .",
    "the other role of the coriolis force , which will be the subject of our paper , is to control the energy transfer over the spectrum in the system . whereas if before the nonlinear term was of the same order with the pressure , which could not block the curl part of the term , then with the coriolis force the pressure and other potential forces ( e.g. , the archemedean force ) block the potential part of the nonlinear term . and the rest of the curl parts of the forces and coriolis force block the nonlinear term . as a result , the spectrum becomes steeper .",
    "that is what we have on small scales , @xmath11 . at the same time , on scales @xmath12 , the system can be in a state of statistical equilibrium : dissipation is negligible , and over the long term the energy exchange between the scales is small .",
    "it appears that the estimate of only the spectra of kinetic energy is not enough to resolve the states with and without rotation and intensive heat sources , and one needs to keep track of the fluxes of kinetic energy over the spectrum , which is considered below .",
    "hereinafter , on the example of an 3d model of thermal convection in a plane layer , we consider the properties of anisotropy caused by rotation both in the physical and especially in the wave spaces started in @xcite typical for geodynamo regimes and compare these results with nonrotating convection .",

    "on the other hand , for the larger region of @xmath10 @xmath149 we still have the direct cascade @xmath150 .",
    "the increase of @xmath1 leads to the narrowing of the region with the inverse cascade and to the increase of the inverse flux .",

    "for all three regimes , the fluxes in the z - direction are much smaller than in the horizontal plane , however , the form of @xmath155 are similar to that of @xmath144 . this asymmetry can be explained as follows . obviously , flux @xmath159 is small for geostrophic flows . for nr",
