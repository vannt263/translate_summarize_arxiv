    "although the subject of much controversy , many authors have suggested a periodicity in the impact craters on earth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a possible cause for this observed approximately 35 my periodicity is the oscillation of the sun vertically about the milky way disk .",
    "oscillations through high density regions in the galactic disk could perturb the oort cloud , inducing comet impacts on the earth .",
    "@xcite first estimated that 80% of terrestrial craters having diameter @xmath0 100 km ( and 50% of the terrestrial craters @xmath0 50 km ) are produced by long - period comets .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the ages of these large craters , as well as infall of cosmic dust , seem to be in correlation with the oscillations of the sun about the galactic midplane as estimated by @xcite .",
    "there were , however , several problems .",
    "the first is that the visible mass present in the galactic disk does not predict the correct periodicity for these oscillations .",
    "using the visible mass alone , plus the contribution from a dark halo predicts an oscillation period of almost 45 my @xcite .",
    "authors who have computed a period consistent with the crater record @xcite have assumed some amount of hidden matter in the disk",
    ". this hidden mass could be present in the form of an additional molecular gas component .",
    "the planck collaboration has indeed measured dark gas with about 100% of @xmath1 mass @xcite .",
    "however , we show in section [ sec : results ] that this is still not enough to account for the period discrepency .",
    "an alternate solution is to assume some dark matter concentrated in the galactic disk , besides that present in the dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite have recently proposed a theory where a small component of dark matter could have dissipative dynamics and cool to form a disk .",
    "@xcite have shown that such a dark disk could give rise to solar oscillations that predict the comet bombardment rate on earth within the allowed uncertainties .",
    "an important question is whether such a dark disk is allowed given the observed kinematics of local milky way stars .",
    "in fact , @xcite claims that the amount of dark disk mass needed to account for the comet rate was ruled out by the @xcite study ( hf2000 ) .",
    "however , it has recently been shown @xcite that non - equilibrium features in the hf2000 sample , namely a net vertical velocity and displacement relative to the galactic midplane , severely bias the hf2000 results . accounting for these features",
    "give an upper bound of about @xmath2 for low scale heights ( @xmath3 pc ) , and an even higher upper bound for thicker scale heights .",
    "a potential difficulty with the dark disk solution is that it a thin disk such as needed by @xcite may be unstable @xcite .",
    "an estimate stability bound was recently derived by @xcite .",
    "this stability bound would potentially require a dark disk thicker than about 30 pc @xcite .",
    "a question is therefore whether such a thick disk could sufficiently perturb the oort cloud to cause comet impacts to match the periodicity .",
    "we show in this paper that this is indeed the case .",
    "an additional concern with the dark disk hypothesis is that there are some major comet events in the history of the earth that fail to match the oscillation pattern .",
    "specifically , the popigai and chicxulub craters are separated by an interval slightly smaller than the 32 my period predicted by the solar oscillations @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that over the history of the earth it is important to take into account spiral arm crossings .",
    "we show that when spiral arms are taken into account , the predicted rate not only matches the comet impact rate , but also correctly predicts the date of the crater that killed the dinosaurs 66 my ago due to the reduced period of the oscillations during the 50 my spent crossing the carina / sagittarius arm .",
    "we compute the oscillations of the sun through the galactic plane by integrating the motion of the sun in the potential computed assuming the mass model described in @xcite .",
    "we followed the bayesian analysis of @xcite in comparing the predicted comet rates from oscillations to a constant comet rate .",
    "we used the craters dated to the past 250 my from the earth impact database , developed and maintained by the planetary and space science center of the university of new brunswick .",
    "we also follow @xcite in correcting the age of the chicxulub crater from 64.98 @xmath4 0.05 my to 66.04 @xmath4 0.05 my flux increase , associated with comet showers , was observed between 63.9 and 65.4 mya @xcite . ] .",
    "we included only craters larger than a certain diameter ; we performed the analysis for diameter cutoffs of @xmath5 20 km , 40 km , and 50 km , giving sample sizes of @xmath6 26 , 13 , and 7 craters respectively .",
    "although the 50 km sample is small , according to @xcite , it contains craters with a high probability of being caused by comets and not asteroids .    in the oscillation model , we convolved the predicted tidal force with the comet shower profile of @xcite . in the constant rate model",
    ", we assumed a constant rate of @xmath7 comets per 250 my .",
    "we defined the likelihood to be given by the l2 inner product of the predicted rate and the comet history , expressed as a probability density @xmath8 in time : @xmath9 the likelihood ratio would therefore be given by the ratio of this quantity computed for the oscillatory model to the quantity computed assuming a constant average rate for the comets .",
    "other effects we account for here are spiral arm crossing and radial oscillations .",
    "we assume spiral arms with an amplitude @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an arm - interarm density ratio of 1.2 - 1.9 ( * ? ? ?",
    "as we are currently entering the orion spur , we assume the current locally measured density to represent the azimuthally averaged density of the disk at the solar radius . for radial oscillations ,",
    "we assume a 17% variation in density @xcite with a period of @xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) , where @xmath12 is the angular velocity of the circular orbit at the position of the sun . according to @xcite , @xmath13 . with a measured tangential velocity of @xmath14 @xcite , we therefore estimate @xmath15 , with the @xcite value of @xmath16 . based on the above value of @xmath17 , as well as on the sun s radial velocity @xmath18",
    ", we estimate the present phase of the sun in these oscillations to be @xmath19 .    since there is a lot of uncertainty in the position of the sun relative to the galactic plane , this will certainly affect whether the model can account for the dinosaur extinction .",
    "we therefore compute the likelihood for the value @xmath20 @xcite as well as for other values of @xmath21 .",
    "we also varied the @xmath22 scale height @xmath23 of the dark disk , as well as the vertical velocity of the sun @xmath24 @xcite and the dark halo density @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : likelihood ] shows the likelihood ratio for the two models as a function of dark disk surface density @xmath26 . although we performed the analysis for various choices of parameters as we show below , in this particular figure a @xmath22 scale height of @xmath27 pc @xcite and a spiral arm amplitude of @xmath28",
    "were assumed .",
    "we also set the height of the sun above the galactic plane to be @xmath29 @xcite , the vertical velocity of the sun to be @xmath30 @xcite , and the dark halo density to be @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "a crater diameter cutoff of 2 km was imposed .",
    "we see that the likelihood ratio is as large as 20 in favor of an oscillatory model , at the best fit value @xmath32 .",
    "we also see that the relative rate of predicted comet impacts at age 66 my also is quite high near this value , indicating that the model correctly predicts the date of the 66 mya chicxulub crater .",
    "[ fig : likelihood ]    figure [ fig : cratersrate ] shows the predicted comet rate in the oscillatory model superposed on the crater record . the time spent within spiral arms",
    "is shown by the double arrows .",
    "we can see that the the comet rate is consistent with the oscillations of the sun when spiral arm crossing is taken into account .",
    "in particular , the chicxulub crater matches the predicted rate .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , the @xmath21 is quite uncertain .",
    "we see that varying @xmath33 does not have a large effect of the likelihood ratio , while it does affect the interpretation of the chicxulub crater .",
    "varying @xmath23 affects the best - fit value of @xmath26 , with larger scale heights allowing more mass , as should be expected .",
    "varying @xmath21 does not significantly affect the results .",
    "[ fig : plots ]    figure [ fig : norad ] shows the result of the computation ( left ) without including radial oscillations and spiral arm crossing and ( right ) including radial oscillations but no spiral arm crossing . in both cases",
    "we see that although the data favors a higher dark disk surface density @xmath26 , it also predicts a relatively lower comet shower rate at the chicxulub date 66 mya . only by including the spiral arm crossings",

    "[ fig : norad ]    figure [ fig : diameters ] shows the effect of varying the crater diameter cutoff .",

    "we have shown that a dark disk consistent with stability bounds can indeed account for the observed comet rate on earth .",
    "we have also shown that spiral arm crossings are crucial in accounting for variations in the comet rate . in particular , the cratering history on earth , including the date of the chicxulub crater 66 mya , is only consistent with the predicted comet shower rate when the spiral arms are taken into account .",
