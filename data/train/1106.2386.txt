    "since the first experimental realization of a bose - einstein condensate with spin degrees of freedom ( spinor bec ) in 1998  @xcite , many interesting phenomena have been investigated . due to the competition between the interatomic interactions and the coupling of atoms to an external magnetic field  @xcite , these systems can exhibit various phases having different spinor order parameters  @xcite .",
    "both theoretical and experimental studies have extensively been conducted on various aspects of spinor becs ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",

    ", the first - order self - consistent approximation ( also called the popov approximation  @xcite ) , which neglects the pair correlation of noncondensed atoms or the anomalous average , can give a good description of thermal equilibrium properties of the system over a wide range of temperatures except near the bec transition point .",
    "this is because at temperatures well above absolute zero , the anomalous average is negligibly small compared with the noncondensate number density .",
    "in contrast , near absolute zero the anomalous average is of the same order of magnitude as the noncondensate number density , but both of them are very small compared with the condensate density and hence negligible . however , for spinor becs , in particular , spin-1  @xmath0 becs , due to the large ratio of spin - independent to spin - dependent interactions , the anomalous average and noncondensate number density are expected to be as important as the spin - dependent interaction between two condensed atoms near absolute zero .",

    "we consider a three - dimensional uniform system of spin-1  @xmath0 atoms with a ferromagnetic interaction , where the spin - independent interaction is stronger than the spin - dependent interaction by a factor of about 200 .",

    "we find that the system undergoes a two - step phase transition , where condensation and spontaneous magnetization occur at different temperatures .",
    "we then examine temperature - dependent magnetization of the noncondensate , which is a remarkable consequence of the spin coherence induced by the magnetized condensate . to investigate the effect of quantum depletion on the phase diagram at absolute zero ,",

    "we find that the system can undergo a two - step phase transition for a certain region of the quadratic zeeman energy : as the temperature decreases , the thermal gas first enters a nonmagnetized superfluid phase ( polar phase ) , and then a superfluid phase with transverse magnetization ( broken - axisymmetry phase ) . that condensation and spontaneous magnetization occur at different temperatures is characteristic of spinor condensates .",

    "in contrast to scalar bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , in spinor becs the effect of a small fraction of noncondensed atoms on the system s magnetism can not be ignored .",
    "this results from the fact that a large ratio of the spin - independent to spin - dependent interactions can significantly magnify the effect of a small number of noncondensed atoms . to examine the effect of quantum depletion and",
    "that of the anomalous average on the magnetism of the system at absolute zero , we have applied the perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath203 , where @xmath381 is the noncondensate fraction , to a @xmath0 spinor bose gas . from the result , we have found that even a very small noncondensate fraction can make a significant modification of the ground - state phase diagram from the mean - field result . we have also found that when the atomic density exceeds a threshold @xmath382 , the deviation of the order parameter from the mean - field result is so large that the applied perturbation method can no longer give quantitatively reliable results . therefore , a system with a higher density , which is usually the case with current experiments , should be treated as a strongly interacting spinor bose gas .",
