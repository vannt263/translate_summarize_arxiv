    "<S> this is partly due to the difficulty in implementing quantum walks in more than one - dimension in a controllable way and partly due to an inadequate understanding of the ssqw .    in this letter , we show that in spite of having very different propagators , the one- and the two - dimensional ssqws and the ordinary one - dimensional discrete time quantum walk are closely related ; each step of the one - dimensional ssqw can be decomposed into two steps of the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk with alternating coin - flip operations . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , every step of the two - dimensional ssqw can be decomposed into two steps of one - dimensional ssqw performed over two independent degrees of freedom in sequence with the same coin .    </S>",

    "<S> . it also paves the way to simulate more complicated hamiltonians using only the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it enables simple schemes to implement complicated quantum walks on any accessible systems . using our decompositions we present implementation schemes to realize one- and two - dimensional ssqws using linear optical setup .    in our scheme </S>",
    "<S> , the one - dimensional quantum walk is performed over the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states of a single photon ( or a light pulse ) whereas we use the time - bins along with the oam of light to realize two - dimensional ssqw . </S>",

    "<S> the proposed setup requires a simple combination of wave - plates , q - plate , polarizing beamsplitters and mirrors , and a ring interferometer is used to implement progressive steps in the walk .    </S>",
    "<S> since both classical light pulses as well as single photons can possess the oam and the time - bins degrees of freedom ( dofs ) , and the proposed setup for the implementation consists of only linear optical elements , our scheme works equally well for single photons and classical light pulses . simulating quantum protocols with classical light offer advantages over the single photons such as non - invasive and real - time measurements , which is not possible with single photons . furthermore , classical light is robust against losses and easy to produce . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme is capable of simulating the majorana modes and the edge states with classical light , and the setup size does not increase with increasing number of steps in the walk , as was the case in the earlier implementation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first scheme where the realization of such exotic modes in two - dimensions is addressed .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk where the coin flip operator @xmath0 and the conditional propagator @xmath1 are @xmath2 here , \\{@xmath3 } are the two orthogonal states in the coin space , @xmath4 are the position states of the walker such that @xmath5 is the forward propagator and @xmath6 is the pauli spin matrix along @xmath7-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the coin parameter @xmath8 $ ] .    repeated action of the propagator @xmath9 , @xmath10 on the states of the walker results in the quantum walk evolution . </S>",
    "<S> note that the operator @xmath11 also yields the same quantum walk dynamics as the propagator @xmath9 for different initial states which are related to each other by the unitary operator @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the two operators , @xmath9 and @xmath12 are equivalent . we shall call it the cyclic property of the quantum walk propagator .    in a one - dimensional ssqw  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the conditional propagator @xmath1   is divided into the left propagator @xmath13 and the right propagator @xmath14 which are separated by a coin - flip operation @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the new quantum walk propagator reads @xmath15 where @xmath16     and @xmath17 defined in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2dss - t1 ] ) and  ( [ eq:2dss - t2 ] ) , and @xmath18 . , scaledwidth=15.0% ]    the propagator @xmath19 for the two - dimensional analog of ssqw on a triangular lattice consists of three conditional propagators @xmath20 s applied in series , separated by the coin operations @xmath21  @xcite @xmath22 where ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2dsst ] ) @xmath23 are the conditional propagators on the two principal axes in the triangular lattice and @xmath18 . the coin operator @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> one - dimensional dtqw  , exhibits two distinct topological phases which can be characterized by the sign of the parameter @xmath25  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interface of these two topological phases supports two bound states corresponding to ( quasi- ) energy @xmath26  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying hamiltonian of this dynamics possesses the particle - hole symmetry which implies that creating a particle with energy @xmath27 is equivalent to annihilating a hole with energy @xmath28 . since the two bound states in the quantum walk </S>",
    "<S> satisfy @xmath29 , the creation and the annihilation operators for these states are the same . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the corresponding modes are the majorana modes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> both one- and two - dimensional ssqws exhibit topological phases in the parameter space of @xmath30 . moreover , choosing site - dependent @xmath31 while keeping the @xmath32 uniform over the lattice can result in a boundary such that we observe different topological phases on both the sides of the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> such boundaries support topologically protected bound states in one - dimensional ssqw and edge states in two - dimensional case  @xcite .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the one- and two - dimensional ssqw can be decomposed into ordinary one - dimensional quantum walks on independent systems . </S>",
    "<S> first we show that a single step of the one - dimensional ssqw is isomorphic to two steps of the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk . </S>",
    "<S> this isomorphism can be established easily by replacing the left and right propagators @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> and   by new ones @xmath33 thus , the new one - dimensional ssqw propagator reads @xmath34 qualitatively , there is no difference between the propagator @xmath35   and the propagator @xmath36  . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference is in the former one the walker jumps on the neighbouring sites and in the later one the walker skips one site in every jump .    </S>",
    "<S> since the one - dimensional ssqw is translation invariant , we can write@xmath37 here the coin - independent translation operators @xmath38 commute with @xmath39 operators . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath40 is the conditional shift operator  . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one - dimensional ssqw operator can be decomposed into two steps of the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk propagators with alternating coin operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , we can perform one - dimensional ssqw on a lattice which consists of only the even- ( or the odd- ) numbered lattice sites by performing two steps of the ordinary quantum walk with alternatively changing coin operators . </S>",
    "<S> a similar decomposition can be obtained for the two - dimensional ssqw propagator @xmath43   in terms of two one - dimensional ssqws performed on independent one - dimensional lattices .    using the definitions  ,  </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath18 and the cyclic property of the quantum walk propagators we can simplify the propagator @xmath43 as @xmath44 where we have used the definition of the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk propagator @xmath9   and the decomposition  . here </S>",
    "<S> the superscript @xmath45 denotes the dof the operator is acting on . </S>",
    "<S> equation   clearly shows that the two - dimensional ssqw on a triangular lattice can be decomposed into two one - dimensional ssqws performed in series on two different dofs .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the advantages of the decompositions   and   is that now we can write the hamiltonian @xmath46 which governs the dynamics in one - dimensional ssqw as a function of the hamiltonian @xmath47 of one - dimensional ordinary quantum walks and the hamiltonian @xmath48 that governs two - dimensional ssqw as a function of @xmath49 ( see supplementary material for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , these decompositions offer an alternative way to express complicated hamiltonians in terms of simple well understood one - dimensional quantum walk hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have shown a way to express one- and two - dimensional ssqw using only ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk on different dofs or on different one - dimensional lattices . in the following , we present optical implementation schemes to simulate ssqw in the oam and the time - bin space of light . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose methods to simulate majorana modes , edge states and the topologically protected bound states in these systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the one - dimensional ssqw propagator @xmath50   in the oam space of light can be implemented by two propagators @xmath51 and @xmath52 in series  . to implement the propagator @xmath9 for the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk in the oam space we can use the scheme presented in  @xcite . in this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the oam states @xmath53 represent the lattice sites and the right- ( @xmath54 ) and the left - handed ( @xmath55 ) circular polarization states of light represent the two orthogonal states of the coin  @xcite . the coin flip operator @xmath0 is realized using the simon - mukunda polarization ( smp ) gadget which consists of a combination of two half - wave plates and two quarter - wave plates mounted in series  @xcite . by rotating the wave - plates one can realize an arbitrary su(@xmath56 ) rotation in the polarization states of light .    </S>",
    "<S> the conditional propagator @xmath1   in this scheme is realized by a combination of a half - wave plate and an optical device called q - plate with the setting @xmath57  ( see supplementary material )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , concatenating an smp gadget , a q - plate and a half - wave plate we can realize the ordinary quantum walk propagator @xmath9   which can perform a single step of quantum walk on the oam of light . placing two such setups in series in a ring interferometer , one can simulate the one - dimensional ssqw . </S>",
    "<S> one - dimensional ssqw in the time - bins space of light can be performed using the scheme presented in  @xcite . in this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the time - bins form the one - dimensional lattice and the polarization serves as the coin . the conditional propagator @xmath1   is realized by splitting the incoming light pulse ( or single photon ) into two spatial modes using a polarizing beam splitter and introducing different optical paths in the two spatial modes . </S>",
    "<S> the smp gadget is used as the coin operator @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a single step of the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk is performed by introducing different delays corresponding to the different orthogonal polarization states of light followed by an smp gadget . repeating this process twice with different smp gadgets corresponding to the parameter @xmath32 and @xmath31 results in the one - dimensional ssqw .    </S>",
    "<S> although , the relation   between the ssqws and the ordinary quantum walk makes the implementation of the one - dimensional ssqw feasible in almost any quantum system , a much simplified scheme can be achieved while realizing the quantum walk in the oam space . to see this </S>",
    "<S> , we recall the ssqw propagator @xmath58 which contains an effective shift operator @xmath59   and a coin - flip operator @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath59 can be realized using only a q - plate and wave - plates by choosing the phase retardation @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the q - plate , the operator @xmath62  ( see supplementary material ) reads @xmath63 clearly , by redefining the coin - flip operator @xmath41 in the ssqw propagator @xmath64 in the following manner @xmath65 which can be realized by an smp device , we can realize the ssqw using a single q - plate and a single smp gadget instead of using two of each as was done in the previous scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> a similar scheme was implemented by cardano et al . in  @xcite with a different coin operation . </S>",
    "<S> although they also showed the topological order in their experiment , it was not clear if their experiment yielded the one - dimensional ssqw presented in  @xcite . from our discussion , this question is now settled .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we present an implementation scheme to perform two - dimensional ssqw on the triangular lattice . in this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> we use both the oam and the time - bins to perform two - dimensional ssqws . </S>",
    "<S> we choose these dofs because these are one of the most favored dofs of light to perform quantum walks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a sketch of our implementation scheme is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scheme2d ] .    </S>",
    "<S> here oam is used as the first principal axis and time - bins are used as the second principal axis in the triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath66 represents the conditional propagator on oam and @xmath17 on time - bins . in order to realize the @xmath67 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we use the q - plate and a smp device as was done in the one - dimensional ssqw in oam space . the @xmath68 operation in the quantum walk </S>",
    "<S> is performed over the time - bins space of light , as discussed earlier .     </S>",
    "<S> is performed over the oam of light ( lower part of the ring interferometer ) and the operator @xmath69 is performed over the time - bins . in this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the incoming light enters the setup through the beamsplitter b which has a very high reflectance @xmath70 ( bottom left corner ) . </S>",
    "<S> the light entering the setup is first transformed by a combination of an smp gadget and a phase - retarded q - plate and then by two time - shift loops which are separated by an smp gadget . </S>",
    "<S> the time - shift loops are realized by sorting the two orthogonal polarization components of light ( using polarizing beamsplitters ) in different spatial modes with unequal path lengths . </S>",
    "<S> one step of the two - dimensional ssqw is completed upon completion of a full circle in the setup . upon returning to the beam splitter </S>",
    "<S> b a small fraction of the light will pass through the beam splitter and rest will be reflected back in the setup . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted part of the light can be used to perform real - time measurements on the oam and the time - bins . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to simulate the topologically protected bound states in quantum walks we need to create a boundary with two distinct topological phases on either sides by assigning position dependent values to the coin parameter @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> it is often hard to realize such coin operator . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple linear optical device , generalized smp gadget , which can be used to realize two different values of @xmath25 for different sections of the oam lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> a light beam having the oam proportional to the value @xmath71 has a ring - shaped intensity distribution with radius @xmath72 of maximum intensity given by @xmath73 i.e. , the radius of the ring is proportional to the square root of the absolute value of @xmath74 of the oam mode  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 is the width of the laser beam at the position @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an smp gadget with wave - plates of radius @xmath77 will cause rotations only for the polarization states of the oam modes between @xmath78 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> rest of the modes will remain unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> a generalized smp gadget consists of two coaxial smp gadgets , one with radius @xmath79 and other , annular shaped , with inner radius @xmath79 and large outer radius ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : modsmdevice ] ) . since </S>",
    "<S> the two smp gadgets used here are independent of each other , they can be set to realize @xmath0 and @xmath80 coin operations which result in different coin operation on different sections of the oam lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> using the generalized smp device different values of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath81 can be chosen which correspond to distinct topological phases , thus making a boundary which supports bound states . in one - dimensional ssqw , </S>",
    "<S> if initially the walker is localized at the boundary , it remains localized with large probability . </S>",
    "<S> these bound states correspond to majorana modes . </S>",
    "<S> since two - dimensional ssqw can be decomposed into two one - dimensional ssqws and we need the boundary only in one direction , we can use the same generalized smp gadget to simulate the edge states in two - dimensional ssqw . </S>",
    "<S> these bounded states can be observed as partially localized states , i.e. , localized in the oam space but spreading in the time - bin space . </S>",
    "<S> both majorana modes and topologically protected edge states are robust against environmental interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> although , the generalized smp gadget provides a sharp transition in the value of the parameter @xmath25 , it may not be sharp on the oam lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the radius of the intensity ring for a given oam mode @xmath74 is not sharp . </S>",
    "<S> this may cause an aberration in the bound states if the parameter @xmath25 varies slightly across the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the two distinct topological phases require well separated values of @xmath25 across the boundary , we will observe topologically protected bound states .     of the smaller smp gadget </S>",
    "<S> is chosen such that it affect only the polarization states of light corresponding to the oam modes between @xmath78 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> rest of the polarization is transformed by the larger smp gadget . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=30.0% ]    to conclude , we have presented schemes to realize ssqws on one- and two - dimensional lattices in optical systems . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the oam and time - bins dofs for our schemes . </S>",
    "<S> the key finding in this letter which made these implementations feasible is the decomposition of ssqw in terms of ordinary one - dimensional quantum walks . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that a single step in one - dimensional ssqw as defined in  @xcite is nothing but two steps of the ordinary one - dimensional quantum walk with alternating coins . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a two - dimensional ssqw ( on a triangular lattice ) can be decomposed as two one - dimensional ssqws performed on two independent dofs in sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we have exploited this nature of ssqws to devise simple schemes to implement them and to simulate exotic topologically bound states .    </S>",
    "<S> we can also interpret the decomposition of ssqw in terms of the ordinary quantum walks as follows : the hamiltonian which governs the dynamics of two - dimensional ssqw can be simulated by the hamiltonians of one - dimensional ssqw which in turn can be simulated by one - dimensional ordinary quantum walk hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> this decomposition can be extended to realize more complicated quantum walks by incorporating multiple steps of the one - dimensional ordinary quantum walk with different coin parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our decomposition brings us a step closer to realizing a universal quantum simulator based purely on quantum walks .    </S>",
