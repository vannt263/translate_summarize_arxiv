    "in recent years , computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) models based on reynolds - averaged navier  stokes ( rans ) equations have been used to support high - consequence decisions related to turbulent flows .",
    "for example , rans simulations have been used to support the development of the emergency evacuation plans in scenarios of pollutant releases in cities  @xcite . in the nuclear energy industry ,",
    "government regulators and plant operators have explored the feasibility of using rans models to model the thermo - hydraulic systems in nuclear power plants to support safety assessments and licensing  @xcite . in these contexts , quantifying and reducing uncertainties in the rans simulations is of critical importance for the stake - holders to make risk - informed decisions .",
    "although the uncertainties in rans simulations may also occur due to uncertain inputs and parameters , meshes , and numerical methods , the uncertainties that are attributed to the inadequacy and intrinsic assumptions in the physical model of turbulence , referred to as model - form uncertainties , are most challenging to quantify in rans simulations .",

    "@xcite was the first to propose a `` composite model theory '' in the context of rans modeling , where the model - form uncertainties are localized to the reynolds stress tensors .",
    "dow and wang  @xcite introduced uncertainties in the turbulent eddy viscosity to estimate the structural uncertainties in the @xmath0@xmath1 model  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , iaccarino and co - workers  @xcite introduced uncertainties directly to the reynolds stress , and estimated the rans modeling uncertainties by perturbing the predicted reynolds stress in a physically realizable range .",
    "recently , xiao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a bayesian framework for quantifying and reducing uncertainties in rans simulations by incorporating velocity observation data and physics - based prior knowledge .",
    "a key element in this framework is the inference of reynolds stress discrepancy field from sparse velocity observations .",
    "therefore , it can be considered a bayesian calibration framework .",
    "this is in contrast to oliver et al .",

    "the physics - neutral bayesian framework of kennedy and ohagan  @xcite treats numerical models as black boxes and does not allow straightforward representation of the prior knowledge  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the available data are usually too sparse in engineering application to drive such physics - neutral approach , which poses a practical hurdle for its acceptance in engineering communities . compared to the bayesian model calibration framework of kennedy and ohagan , a notable feature of the method of xiao et al .",
    "@xcite is that it incorporates physics - based prior knowledge , which can effectively augment the information provided by the limited amount of data .",
    "sources of prior knowledge range from constraints that can be expressed with mathematical rigor ( e.g. , physical realizability of reynolds stress tensor ) to imprecise , subjective beliefs that are not amenable to mathematical representation ( e.g. , empirical knowledge accumulated in the turbulence modeling from decades of applications of rans simulations ) .",
    "the target application scenario of the framework proposed in  @xcite is the prediction of complex turbulent flows with a limited amount of observation data .",
    "the framework enables predictions with quantified uncertainties by combining numerical model simulations and observation data ( e.g. , real - time measurements from sensors in a nuclear power plant or data from air quality monitoring stations in a city ) . as in other bayesian inference frameworks , the posterior distributions of the predicted",
    "qois depend on both prior information and data .",
    "since the amount of data is limited in the application scenario , the effects of prior knowledge are expected to be particularly important .",

    "smooth spatial distribution of the reynolds stresses , 5 .",
    "overall understanding on the coherent structures of the flow , 6",
    ".   subjective belief on the discrepancies of predicted reynolds stress tensors ( or more precisely their projections , including the magnitude , shape , and orientation ) in different flow regions .",
    "items 12 are strict constraints resulting from the assumption of the modeling and the physical realizability , which can be guaranteed straightforwardly in the uncertainty quantification framework  @xcite . in contrast , items 36 involve analysts physical understanding and subjective judgment of the flow .",
    "the strict constraints are built into the framework of xiao et al.@xcite , while proper means are provided for the analyst to specify subjective priors of various precisions . in this study , we show that the inference uncertainties ( in reynolds stresses and other qois ) are significantly reduced by using realistic , informative priors compared to using non - informative priors .",
    "we also show that using more informative priors can lead to similar inference uncertainty reduction compared to that obtained by incorporating additional observation data .",
    "both comparisons demonstrate that the empirical knowledge accumulated in the turbulence modeling community can be effectively used for quantifying and reducing rans model uncertainties .",
    "although the importance of prior knowledge is demonstrated specifically in the context of rans modeling of turbulent flows , it is expected that the conclusions can be extended to other complex physical systems as well .    the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "the framework introduced in @xcite is summarized with emphasis on the utilization and representation of prior knowledge .",
    "numerical simulations based on the flow in a channel with periodic constrictions are presented in section  3 to highlight the importance of informative prior knowledge . in section  4",
    "we further discuss the mapping of reynolds stress and mean velocities to show the success and limitation of the framework . finally , section 5 concludes the paper .",

    "the @xmath80 distribution barely covers the truth and the mean is biased .",
    "specifically , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauw_pehill]a that @xmath79 is overcorrected from @xmath81 to @xmath82 and undercorrected from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "significant improvement is achieved when an informative @xmath2 is adopted , which is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : tauw_pehill]b and  [ fig : tauw_pehill]d .",
    "we can see that in most part of the region ( between @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , the posterior ensemble has a better agreement with the benchmark . moreover , the posterior pdf is wider than that of case d2 and well covers the truth , indicating that the overconfidence existed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauw_pehill]c is reduced .",
    "all of these results demonstrate the merits of incorporating empirical knowledge into the @xmath2 field .",
    "it is noted that in the vicinity of the hill crest ( i.e. , near @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) , the posterior ensembles of both cases show less improvement .",
    "this is because the flow in the region with rapid spatial variations has a relative small length scale and thus a weak correlation with the flow in other regions .",
    "consequently , the corrections are not effective due to the weak correlations between this region and the regions with observations .",
    "in addition to the amount of observation data , the arrangement of observed locations is also a crucial factor , as it affects the inversion results of model discrepancy and corresponding corrections to the predicted flow field . since the model discrepancies vary location by location , the observed information is weighted . designing the layout of the measuring points to achieve a more effective use of observation data",
    "is referred to as `` experimental design '' . in this section",
    "we will demonstrate that prior knowledge will also improve the experimental design for quantifying and reducing the model - form uncertainties .",
    "two principles for experimental design should be mentioned in the proposed framework .",
    "first , the observations should be placed in the regions where the rans predictions are relatively unreliable ( e.g. , the recirculation area ) .",
    "second , more observations should be allocated to the regions where the length scale of flow is small .",
    "this is because the inference and correction of model discrepancies in the unobserved regions are based on their correlations with the observed locations .",
    "to demonstrate the effects of prior knowledge in the experimental design , another scenario of case d2 with a different arrangement of observations is investigated .",
    "instead of placing the observations with informative prior based on two principles mentioned above , we uniformly arrange the same number of observations used in the case d2 in the entire flow field , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : u_obs_pehill]a",
    ".     profiles of case d2 .",
    "( a ) the observations are uniformly arranged across the domain ; ( b ) the observations are arranged based on the prior knowledge of the flow .",

    "[ fig : u_obs_pehill]a and  [ fig : u_obs_pehill]b , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : u_obs_pehill]a shows that the bias in the recirculation zone is only partially corrected with a uniform layout of observations .",
    "the reverse flow near the wall ( @xmath89 ) is still poorly predicted , since no observation is available in the nearby region .",
    "moreover , overcorrection can be seen in the downstream ( @xmath90 ) , where the baseline rans prediction is relatively accurate .",
    "the reason is that the length scale of flow in the near wall region is small , while no observation is placed in the windward side of hills ( @xmath91 to @xmath86 ) .",
    "consequently , the spatial correlation is not strong enough to correct the profiles and constrain the uncertainties by incorporating the information from the observations .",
    "in bayesian frameworks , uncertainties in the posterior distribution can be reduced by incorporating observation data .",
    "this statement can be confirmed by exploring another scenario of case s1 in which the velocities at additional 16 points at @xmath91 are observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : tausynobs ] shows the inferred posterior ensemble of reynolds stress component @xmath59 with more observation data . by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : taus1]b and  [ fig : tausynobs ] , we can see that the scattering of the samples is significantly reduced with more observation data , especially near the regions where the additional observation points are introduced .",
    "therefore , incorporating more observation data improves the inferred quantities ( i.e. , reynolds stress ) and reduces the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "profiles of case s1 with more velocity observations ( 32 compared to 16 in the original case s1 ) .",
    "the ensemble profiles are shown at eight locations @xmath61 , compared with synthetic truth and baseline results .",
    "all of the samples are collapsed to the truth , and thus the corresponding lines of samples and sample mean overlap with the synthetic truth.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ] +   +    however , for most engineering problems the amount of data is limited and is insufficient to drive a physics - neutral , data - based statistical frameworks proposed in the statistical community . on the other hand , empirical knowledge is available for many practical applications thanks to the accumulated experiences in the engineering community .",
    "we claim that an important advantage of the proposed framework is to provide a rigorous bayesian approach incorporating various sources of empirical knowledge .",
    "the incorporated empirical knowledge complements the inadequate observation data and thus further reduces the model - form uncertainties in rans simulations .",
    "an essential component of the proposed model - form uncertainty quantification and reduction framework is the inversion of discrepancies in the reynolds stress tensor .",
    "however , the inferred quantities ( i.e. , discrepancy in the reynolds stress field ) do not uniquely map to the corresponding observed quantities ( i.e. , velocities ) .",
    "this is due to the ill - possedness of the problem .",
    "that is , the mapping from velocity field to reynolds stress field has multiple solutions .",
    "such ill - possedness is common in many inversion problems @xcite .",

    "the ensemble profiles are shown at eight locations @xmath61 of case s1 , compared with synthetic truth and baseline results.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ] +   +    the non - unique mapping can be demonstrated by the case s1 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : us1 ] , the posterior velocity profiles converge to the truth and the uncertainties ( i.e. , scattering of velocity samples ) are nearly eliminated based on the synthetic observation data . however , the inferred ensemble of modes coefficients for reynolds stress discrepancy are still scattered ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parahis1 ] ) .",
    "this evidence implies that the reynolds stress fields are still scattered , even though the corresponding velocity fields are almost the same .",
    "the scattering of reynolds stress fields also can be seen clearly in posterior ensemble of @xmath92 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauxxsyn1 ] .",
    "the scattering range of posterior @xmath92 ensemble is large in the entire domain , which indicates the velocities are not sensitive to @xmath92 in this problem .",
    "nonetheless , based on the concept of `` goal - oriented uncertainty quantification ''  @xcite , the merits of proposed framework can be justified depending on the quantities of interest ( qoi ) .",
    "if qoi is the velocity field or wall shear stress , the predicted results are significantly improved through the framework . on the other hand ,",
    "if the reynolds stress is the qoi , more prior knowledge or observation data are needed to constrain the problem of ill - posedness .",
    "it has been shown in case s1 that the true reynolds stress can also be inferred exactly , so long as sufficient data and prior knowledge are given .",
    "in this paper , we discussed the merits of incorporating various prior knowledge into the proposed bayesian framework for model - form uncertainty quantification and reduction in rans simulations .",
    "the prior knowledge considered in the framework includes the smoothness and realizability of reynolds stress tensor field , overall understanding on the coherent structures of the flow , and the empirical experiences of rans modeling .",

    "incorporating the prior information enables a more efficient usage of limited observation data .",
    "meanwhile , the study also suggests that the proposed framework provides a relatively rigorous way to express and incorporate the existing empirical knowledge on rans modeling .",
