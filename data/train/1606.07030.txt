    "an important tool to study the physics of quantum wires is measurements of their conductance as a function of parameters such as the filling fraction or temperature.@xcite in order to understand the results of such experiments it is important to find an appropriate model not only for the quantum wire itself but for the full system including the leads . typically , the properties of the quantum wire are strongly affected by electron - electron interactions .",
