    "this paper presents a very simple idea for calculating the low - lying energy levels and associated eigenfunctions in quantum mechanics .",
    "we begin with the modest goal of calculating just the ground - state energy @xmath0 of a parity - symmetric potential @xmath1 by treating @xmath0 as small and using @xmath0 itself as a perturbation parameter .",
    "of course , the ground - state energy is typically not small compared with @xmath2 , and thus one might expect that a perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath0 would be so inaccurate as to be useless .",
    "however , for a broad class of potentials the calculation of @xmath0 turns out to be surprisingly accurate .",
    "moreover , the approximants to @xmath0 emerge in a form that is ideally suited to shanks extrapolation , and thus the numerical accuracy of the calculation can be further improved .",
    "even more surprising , if the perturbation series for the ground - state energy is converted to pad form , the poles and zeros of the pad approximants converge to the odd - parity and even - parity energy levels , respectively , and thus the method proposed here can be used to calculate all of the low - lying energy levels of @xmath1 .",
    "the specific problem treated here is that of solving the time - independent schrdinger eigenvalue problem @xmath3 where @xmath4 vanishes as @xmath5 . for simplicity , we assume that the potential @xmath1 is an _ even _ function of @xmath6 , and to begin we limit our attention to the _ ground - state _",
    "eigenfunction @xmath4 , which is an even and nodeless function of @xmath6 .",
    "we treat the energy @xmath7 as being small and seek a perturbation expansion for @xmath4 as a power series in @xmath7 : @xmath8 we will see that for the ground - state energy @xmath9 this series is convergent and also that the radius of convergence of the series is the energy @xmath10 of the first excited state .",
    "we substitute @xmath4 in ( [ e02 ] ) into ( [ e01 ] ) and collect powers of @xmath7 .",
    "the result is the sequence of differential equations @xmath11 and @xmath12 of course , we can not require that @xmath13 satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions @xmath14 because @xmath15 is not an eigenvalue .",
    "instead , we work on the half - line @xmath16 and impose the _ inhomogeneous _ boundary conditions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the solution @xmath19 to ( [ e03 ] ) subject to these boundary conditions is unique .",
    "we solve ( [ e04 ] ) for @xmath20 by using the method of reduction of order .",
    "we substitute @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and get @xmath23 multiplying by @xmath13 , the integrating factor for this equation , gives @xmath24'=\\psi_0 ^ 2(x)\\phi_{k-1}(x).\\ ] ] using @xmath25 we obtain @xmath26    without loss of generality , we impose the boundary condition @xmath27 for @xmath28 and integrate ( [ e07 ] ) again to obtain @xmath29 this equation may be iterated repeatedly to find the expression for @xmath30 as a @xmath31-fold integral over @xmath32 .",
    "the expression for @xmath33 is a @xmath34-fold integral .",
    "the boundary condition that @xmath27 is naturally imposed at @xmath35 because we are assuming that the potential @xmath1 is symmetric under parity reflection .",
    "an immediate consequence of this requirement seems to be that @xmath4 is normalized so that @xmath36 .",
    "however , we emphasize that this conclusion is only valid so long as the perturbation series ( [ e02 ] ) converges ; if @xmath37 exceeds the radius of convergence of the series ( [ e02 ] ) , we can no longer assume that @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath7 is an odd - parity eigenvalue of @xmath1 , @xmath39 .",
    "to summarize , the explicit expression for @xmath4 in terms of the @xmath30 is @xmath40 \\label{e09}\\ ] ] and the derivative of @xmath4 is given by @xmath41 from ( [ e10 ] ) , we immediately deduce the equation @xmath42 where on the right side of ( [ e11 ] ) we have used the relation @xmath43 , which holds in the perturbative regime ( that is , inside the radius of convergence of the power series in @xmath7 ) .",
    "accordingly , we define the function @xmath44 by @xmath45    we now wish to calculate the ground - state energy . the quantization condition that determines",
    "the ground - state eigenvalue is simply that the slope of the eigenfunction ( [ e10 ] ) vanish at @xmath35 : @xmath46 .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , the ground - state eigenfunction is determined for all @xmath6 , negative as well as positive , by parity symmetry .",
    "thus , an _ implicit _ equation for the ground - state energy @xmath0 is @xmath47 .",
    "the function @xmath44 has a power series expansion of the general form @xmath48 the first three terms in this series expansion for @xmath44 are explicitly @xmath49 .",
    "\\label{e14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear from this expression that since @xmath50 is negative , the coefficients @xmath51 are positive for all @xmath52 . because there are nested integrals , the form of the equation @xmath53 is reminiscent of a rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation expansion @xcite but the form of ( [ e14 ] ) is much simpler because there is _ no explicit reference to the potential _ @xmath1 . the entire dependence on the potential is contained in the function @xmath13 , which satisfies the differential - equation boundary - value problem @xmath54 , @xmath17 , @xmath25 .",
    "the calculational scheme used here is the exact low - energy analog of the wkb approximation , which is valid in the limit as @xmath55 .",
    "the wkb formula for the @xmath56th eigenvalue ( to all orders in wkb ) is @xcite @xmath57 where the contour @xmath58 encircles the two turning points in the positive sense .",
    "the turning points are the two real solutions to @xmath59 , and @xmath60 obeys the recursion relation @xmath61 \\quad(n\\geq2).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the wkb series is normally thought of as a formal series in powers of the `` small '' parameter @xmath62 .",
    "however , @xmath62 is dimensional and can not actually be regarded as small . for that reason ,",
    "we have not included it in the series ( [ e15 ] ) .",
    "the true small parameter in the wkb series is in fact @xmath63 . indeed , evaluating the integrals in this wkb series typically produces a series expansion in inverse ( fractional ) powers of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , for the anharmonic potential @xmath64 , the wkb series expansion reads @xmath65 where the numerical coefficients @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we emphasize that ( [ e15 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) are _ implicit _ representations for @xmath7 , and one must revert the series to find an explicit expression for @xmath69 as a series in powers of @xmath70 . a significant difference between the two series ( [ e14 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] )",
    "is that while the wkb series ( [ e15 ] ) is divergent , the series ( [ e14 ] ) is _ convergent_. as we will see in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , the radius of convergence of ( [ e14 ] ) is finite and larger than the ground - state energy @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the radius of convergence is @xmath10 , the energy of the first excited state ; this is because @xmath71 in the denominator in ( [ e12 ] ) vanishes when @xmath72 .",
    "the series ( [ e14 ] ) determines more than just the ground - state energy .",
    "since @xmath71 vanishes at all of the odd - parity eigenvalues and @xmath73 vanishes at all of the even - parity eigenvalues , the function @xmath74 , as we can see in ( [ e12 ] ) , has simple poles at all the odd - parity eigenvalues and simple zeros at all the even - parity eigenvalues .",
    "these distant poles and zeros are inaccessible to the perturbation expansion used here .",
    "however , they become accessible if the function @xmath44 that the perturbation series represents is analytically continued outside its radius of convergence . an approximate and highly accurate analytic continuation is achieved by converting the truncated series for @xmath44 to a sequence of pad approximants . in sec .",
    "[ s6 ] we construct explicitly the diagonal pad sequence for the illustrative potentials considered in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] and obtain good numerical results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ s2 ] we consider potentials of the form @xmath75 . to examine the accuracy of the procedure we consider the special cases of the linear potential ( @xmath76 ) , the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath77 ) , and the square - well potential ( @xmath78 ) .",

    "[ s3 ] we show that the numerical approximants obtained in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] are in a form that is ideally suited for shanks extrapolation and that a significant improvement in the accuracy of the numerical results can be achieved by performing this extrapolation procedure .",
    "then , in sec .  [ s4 ]",
    "we show that even greater numerical accuracy can be achieved by using the approximate eigenfunction to calculate the expectation value of the hamiltonian .",
    "we extend our analysis to the case of the @xmath80-symmetric potentials and discuss the potential @xmath81 in detail in sec .",

    "therefore , the graph of the function @xmath44 passes through @xmath15 at @xmath83 and rises monotonically as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the value of @xmath7 at which @xmath44 passes through 1 is the ground - state energy @xmath0 of @xmath1 .",

    "these features are exemplified by the following numerical results : @xmath227 the first - order result happens to be the same as for @xmath219 because @xmath228 .",
    "the second - order result is _ less _ than @xmath0 , rather than approaching the exact value from above , and the approximant is unchanged in third order because @xmath229 .",
    "the reason for choosing the contour as we did is that the integrals over @xmath6 that are used to construct @xmath30 and @xmath33 remain real , and in fact equal those for the hermitian potential @xmath220 , thus making the evaluation of the coefficients no more difficult than in the hermitian case .",
    "the difference is that in calculating the expectation value of @xmath174 according to ( [ e39 ] ) , the truncated wave functions @xmath187 and @xmath201 are complex because of the replacement of @xmath103 by @xmath230 in the expansion ( [ e02 ] ) .",
    "however , by taking the real parts the integrals can be decomposed into a number of real integrals over the @xmath30 .",
    "the results are @xmath231 again , both @xmath232 and @xmath233 are less than the true value @xmath0 but closer than @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively . recall that @xmath179 and @xmath142 require about the same calculational effort .    in summary",
    ", we can see that while the results do converge to the ground - state energy , the convergence is not as rapid as for the corresponding hermitian potential @xmath236 .",
    "this is not surprising considering the very similar variational results in ref .",
    "@xcite , where high - dimensional matrices were diagonalized to obtain the numerical approximations to the eigenvalues .",
    "as explained in sec .  [ s1 ] , one can find the approximate poles and zeros of @xmath74 by converting ( [ e14 ] ) to the diagonal sequence of pad approximants .",
    "the poles give approximations to the odd - parity eigenvalues , while the zeros give approximations to the even - parity eigenvalues . in tables",
    "[ t5]-[t7 ] below we list the first four eigenvalues obtained from the pad approximants @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 for the potentials considered in subsecs .  [ ss21]-[ss23 ] .",
