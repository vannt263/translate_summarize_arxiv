    "the concept of fault diameter of cartesian product graphs was first described in @xcite , but the upper bound was wrong , as shown by xu , xu and hou who provided a small counter example and corrected the mistake @xcite .",
    "more precisely , denote by @xmath20 the fault diameter of a graph @xmath0 , a maximum diameter of @xmath0 after deletion of any @xmath2 vertices , and @xmath21 the cartesian product of graphs @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "xu , xu and hou proved @xcite @xmath23 while the claimed bound in @xcite was @xmath24 .",
    "( our notation here slightly differs from notation used in @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the result was later generalized to graph bundles in @xcite and generalized graph products ( as defined by @xcite ) in @xcite .",
    "here we show that in most cases of cartesian graph bundles the bound can indeed be improved to the one claimed in @xcite .",
    "methods used involve the theory of mixed connectivity and recent results on mixed fault diameters @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we also give the analogous improved upper bound for edge fault diameter .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we recall that the graph products and graph bundles often appear as practical interconnection network topologies because of some attractive properties they have . in section [ preliminaries ]",
    "we provide general definitions , in particular of the connectivities .",
    "section [ bundles ] introduces graph bundles and recalls relevant previous results .",
    "the improved bounds are proved in section [ results ] .",
    "graph products and bundles belong to a class of frequently studied interconnection network topologies . for example",
    "meshes , tori , hypercubes and some of their generalizations are cartesian products .",
    "it is less known that some other well - known interconnection network topologies are cartesian graph bundles , for example twisted hypercubes @xcite and multiplicative circulant graphs @xcite .    in the design of large interconnection networks",
    "several factors have to be taken into account .",
    "a usual constraint is that each processor can be connected to a limited number of other processors and that the delays in communication must not be too long .",
    "furthermore , an interconnection network should be fault tolerant , because practical communication networks are exposed to failures of network components .",
    "both failures of nodes and failures of connections between them happen and it is desirable that a network is robust in the sense that a limited number of failures does not break down the whole system .",
    "a lot of work has been done on various aspects of network fault tolerance , see for example the survey @xcite and the more recent papers @xcite .",
    "in particular the fault diameter with faulty vertices , which was first studied in @xcite , and the edge fault diameter have been determined for many important networks recently @xcite .",
    "usually either only edge faults or only vertex faults are considered , while the case when both edges and vertices may be faulty is studied rarely .",
    "for example , @xcite consider hamiltonian properties assuming a combination of vertex and edge faults . in recent work on fault",
    "diameter of cartesian graph products and bundles @xcite , analogous results were found for both fault diameter and edge fault diameter . however , the proofs for vertex and edge faults are independent , and our effort to see how results in one case may imply the others was not successful .",
    "a natural question is whether it is possible to design a uniform theory that covers simultaneous faults of vertices and edges . some basic results on edge , vertex and mixed fault diameters for general graphs appear in @xcite .",
    "in order to study the fault diameters of graph products and bundles under mixed faults , it is important to understand generalized connectivities . mixed connectivity which generalizes both vertex and edge connectivity , and some basic observations for any connected graph are given in @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any earlier work on mixed connectivity .",
    "a closely related notion is the connectivity pairs of a graph @xcite , but after mader @xcite showed the claimed proof of generalized menger s theorem is not valid , work on connectivity pairs seems to be very rare .",
    "upper bounds for the mixed fault diameter of cartesian graph bundles are given in @xcite that in some case also improve previously known results on vertex and edge fault diameters on these classes of cartesian graph bundles @xcite .",
    "however results in @xcite address only the number of faults given by the connectivity of the fibre ( plus one vertex ) , while the connectivity of the graph bundle can be much higher when the connectivity of the base graph is substantial , and results in @xcite address only the number of faults given by the connectivity of the base graph ( plus one vertex ) , while the connectivity of the graph bundle can be much higher when the connectivity of the fibre is substantial .",
    "an upper bound for the mixed fault diameter that would take into account both types of faults remains to be an interesting open research problem .",

    "note that the reverse sequence gives rise to the same subgraph .",
    "hence we use @xmath59 for a path either from @xmath43 to @xmath44 or from @xmath44 to @xmath43 .",

    ", a connectivity pair of a graph is an ordered pair @xmath79 of two integers such that there is some set of @xmath70 vertices and @xmath80 edges whose removal disconnects the graph and there is no set of @xmath81 vertices and @xmath80 edges or of @xmath70 vertices and @xmath82 edges with this property .",

    "in fact , as shown in @xcite , ( 2 ) implies ( 1 ) , so @xmath79 is a connectivity pair exactly when ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) hold .    from the definition we easily observe that any connected graph @xmath0 is @xmath85 + connected , @xmath86+connected for any @xmath87 and @xmath88+connected for any @xmath89 . in our notation",
