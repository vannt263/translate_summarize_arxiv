    "various observations suggest substantial gas accretion disks around young stellar objects , so - called protoplanetary disks .",
    "transport of the angular momentum is needed for gas accretion . at present ,",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence driven by magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is thought to be the most promising mechanism for angular momentum transport . however , protoplanetary disks have very low fraction of charged components .",
    "this is due to their low temperature and high density ; recombination is efficient in high density gas , and thermal ionization does not work except for very inner regions . in order to understand disk evolution , we must clarify which part of the disk is magnetorotationally unstable .",
    "magnetic reynolds number @xmath0 ( u and l are characteristic velocity and length respectively , and @xmath1 is magnetic diffusion coefficient ) is used to be a measure of such instability .",
    "if @xmath2 is large , the region is a magnetically active zone ; if @xmath2 is small , the region is a magnetically inactive , so - called , `` dead zone''@xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 is inversely proportional to the ionization degree , the investigation of ionization degree is important to estimate the value of @xmath2 , or the location of the mri - inactive region .",
    "a number of studies on the ionization degree in protoplanetary disks have appeared in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies assume steady state for reactions and do not consider the time - dependent ionization events",
    ". however , some observation has shown that young stars emit x - ray flares whose timescales are order of a day @xcite . some of the dynamical timescales ( e.g. , reconnection ) are expected to be very short .",
    "these facts indicate that time - dependent calculation is needed to investigate the ionization degree in realistic dynamical environments .",
    "however , it remains difficult to calculate highly time - dependent ionization degree numerically because the network of chemical reactions in the gas of the disks is highly complicated .",
    "some studies on the ionization degree in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. @xcite ) did not consider the effect of dust grains since the inclusion of their effect complexifies the reactions further ; but the effect of dust grains can not been ignored , since very efficient capture of charged particles by dust grains makes the ionization degree much lower .",
    "there are many studies on the ionization degree of the protoplanetary disks , but no one has calculated that of circumplanetary disks with dust grains yet .",
    "it is important to understand the structure and evolution of circumplanetary disks , since the mass accretion through the disk onto the central planet is important in the early formation phases of the disks , and in addition , they might be the sites of satellites formation .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a fast and accurate time - dependent calculation method for the ionization degree in protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks .",
    "we try to reduce the computation time since we want to plug our method into mhd simulations .",
    "we adopt gaussian distribution approximation for the charge distribution of dust grains @xcite .",
    "this approximation decreases the number of equations and allows us to calculate the ionization degree more efficiently especially when the dust grains have wide range of the charge distribution .",
    "we use the piecewise exact solution that is developed by @xcite . in this method",
    ", we analytically solve some part of the reaction equation first , and use the solution as an initial condition of time integration of other terms .",
    "this solution enables us to calculate with larger time step .",
    "our method can be applied to both circumplanetary disks and protoplanetary disks , and can be conveniently plugged into multi - dimensional mhd codes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe the chemical reactions in the planetary disks , and derive equations for our calculation . the methods to speed up the calculation are shown . in section 3 , we test our method by calculating the ionization degree in the protoplanetary disks . in section 4 ,",
    "we apply our method for circumplanetary disks , and discuss the occurrence of mri .",
    "summery is in section 5 .",
    "gas in the protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks is mostly neutral hydrogen molecules .",
    "however , they are thought to be ionized weakly by ionization source such as cosmic rays , x - rays , and ultraviolet radiation .",
    "resultant ionized particles make secondary ions and molecules , which enable further complex reactions .",
    "we describe representative reactions .",
    "when hydrogen molecules are ionized @xmath3 @xmath4 immediately reacts with @xmath5 to produce @xmath6 : @xmath7 reaction between @xmath6 and molecules ( e.g. , co ) leads to heavier molecular ions : @xmath8 molecular ions are destroyed by charge exchange reactions with atomic heavy metals such as @xmath9 : @xmath10 as long as atomic heavy metals are abundant , dissociative recombination @xmath11 is slow , and reaction ( equation @xmath12 ) exceeds . a small fraction of metal ions are destroyed by radiative recombination : @xmath13",
    "we describe major molecular ions ( e.g. @xmath14 ) as @xmath15 , and major heavy metal ions ( e.g. @xmath16 ) as @xmath17 for simplicity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of dust grains should be also considered .",
    "ions and free electrons are captured by dust grains , and it lowers the ionization degree . with sufficient dust grains ,",
    "ionization degree is determined mainly by electron capture rate of dust grains . in figure 1",
    ", we show the schematic view of reactions .",
    "cc     is removed from figure 1 because charge transfer is so fast that dissociative recombination and capture by dust grains can be ignored . ]",
    "is removed from figure 1 because charge transfer is so fast that dissociative recombination and capture by dust grains can be ignored . ]",
    "most of the gas in a protoplanetary disk is neutral , so we assume that the number density of the neutral gas @xmath18 is large enough and does not depend on ionization degree .",
    "the basic equations are the following : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number density of each particles ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 is the charge of dust grains , @xmath26 is ionization rate , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the rate coefficients for dissociative recombination , radiative recombination , charge transfer , and capture of gaseous particles by dust grains , respectively .",
    "the timescale of charge transfer is so short that we can neglect dissociative recombination and capture of molecular ions by dust grains .",
    "this means that almost all the positive charges are transferred to the heavy metal ions . ignoring the time - derivative term and the second and fourth terms on the right hand side of equation @xmath31",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath32 .",
    "then , we can write the equations simply as follows : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 in this way , we can treat the reaction equations as if @xmath17 are formed directly by primary ionization as in figure 2 .",
    "numerical calculation of equation @xmath36 is not an easy task .",
    "first , as the maximum value of @xmath37 becomes greater , the number of terms and equations increases , and the system of equations become more complicated .",
    "second , since the timescales in the system are very different , it is difficult to solve the equations explicitly in time .",
    "we describe our method to speed up the calculation of these equations in sections 2.4 and 2.5 .",
    "we use the value of rate coefficients of recombination @xmath38 and charge transfer @xmath29 given by umist database ( rate06 ) , and summarize them in table1 .",
    ".rate coefficients given by umist database ( rate06 ) .",
    "@xmath39 shows the temperature . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     our result indicates that almost entire parts of circumplanetary disks are mri - inactive .",
    "previous investigation on circumplanetary disks is mainly focused on active disks for theoretical reasons , but all regions in circumplanetary disks we investigated turn out to be the mri - inactive region .",
    "this suggests that mri does not occur for a long time , and satellites can be formed slowly , perhaps by gravitational collapse .",
    "the temperature of the disk might be lower because viscous heating is not so efficient",
    ". however , there are many other accretion mechanisms such as gravitational torques and spiral waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we would like to consider these effects in the future work .",
    "there remains various uncertainty on circumplanetary disks , for example , how many dust grains remain after planet formation , and how large they are .",
    "we have to study ionization degree in various cases .",
    "we also have to investigate it using other disk models . in this work ,",
    "we suppose only fixed size of dust grains , so the result may change if we consider the coagulation of dust grains ; or if we consider ice as dust grains , result also may change .",
    "we have developed a fast and accurate method to calculate the ionization degree in protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks .",
    "this method can calculate it time dependently by using the following two kinds of speed - up device .",
    "+ 1)gaussian approximation for the charge distribution of dust grains .",
    "we have confirmed that the charge distribution of dust grains can be approximated by gaussian distribution @xcite by solving basic reaction equations .",
    "this approximation can reduce the number of equations .",
    "+ 2)piecewise exact solution .",
    "we have used piecewise exact solution that is developed by @xcite .",
    "we solve only rapid reaction terms analytically in advance , then we solve remaining terms numerically using the analytic solutions as an initial condition of time integration .",
    "this method enables us to calculate without limitation of time step by rapid reactions .",
    "since our method can calculate the ionization degree accurately and very rapidly , we would like to plug our method into mhd simulations .",
    "we have checked our calculation method by comparing the result with the direct calculation of basic reaction equations and shown that they agree very well .",
    "we have applied our calculation method for circumplanetary disks .",
    "our method can calculate ionization degree quickly even when the dispersion of dust grains is about @xmath40 .",
    "we have investigated with model parameters @xmath41 cm , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the results show that almost all regions of circumplanetary disks are the mri - inactive regions .",
    "this suggests that gas in circumplanetary disks accrete more slowly than previously thought .",
