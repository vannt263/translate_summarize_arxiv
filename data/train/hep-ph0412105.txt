    "recent experiments in neutrino physics which have established that neutrino masses are in the sub - ev range have provided a new reason for taking supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) seriously .",
    "this has to do with using the seesaw mechanism to understand the extreme smallness of neutrino masses compared to charged fermion masses@xcite .",
    "the seesaw mechanism consists of extending the standard model by introducing three right - handed neutrinos with large majorana masses @xmath3 .",
    "simple arguments based on the atmospheric oscillation data then tell us that at least one @xmath3 is close to the conventional gut scale @xmath4 gev , perhaps suggesting that the seesaw scale , @xmath3 and gut scale are one and the same .",
    "the minimal gut that unifies the right - handed neutrinos with the other fermions of the standard model and leads to the seesaw mechanism is the so(10 ) model where all quarks and leptons are unified into one * 16 * dimensional spinor multiplet .",
    "this raises the possibility that the variety of masses and mixings of quarks and leptons can be understood in terms of a smaller number of parameters than in the standard model with three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "in fact , various recent works in the minimal so(10 ) models with a single * 10 * and a single @xmath5 higgs multiplets@xcite have substantiated this point of view .",
    "unlike the generic seesaw models based on the extension of the standard model as well as right - handed neutrino extended su(5 ) model , the above so(10 ) models have fewer parameters and lead to predictions for neutrino mixings and phases in their minimal version without any extra symmetry assumptions .",
    "their predictions for solar and atmospheric mixing angles are in agreement with present observations@xcite and that for @xmath1 is not far below the present upper limits , making the model testable in planned experiments@xcite .",
    "measurement of @xmath1 will therefore provide a crucial test of these models .",
    "it has further been shown that the simplest way to accommodate ckm cp violation in these models is to include an additional higgs field belonging to the * 120 * dimensional representation@xcite .",
    "the model with * 120 * still remains predictive in the neutrino sector despite a small increase in the number of parameters@xcite and also leads to a solution to the susy cp problem .",
    "since the quarks and leptons are unified in a gut , it predicts that proton is no longer stable and therefore proton decay becomes another test of any gut such as so(10 ) .",
    "the present experimental bounds on the proton lifetime are in fact known to severely constrain some gut models@xcite and one must therefore make sure that the above class of so(10 ) models are in agreement with present experimental results .    in most generic susy guts , the dimension five operators induced by colored higgsino@xcite provide the dominant contribution to the proton decay amplitude rather than the dimension six operators induced by gauge bosons . since the dimension five operators arise from diagrams involving yukawa couplings , predictions for proton lifetime get related to fermion mass textures .",
    "for example , in simple gut theories such as minimal su(5 ) , where by minimal we mean that only the most general renormalizable terms are included in the superpotential , the up- and down - type quark mass matrices are proportional to the yukawa matrices , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . in this case",
    "the proton decay rate , @xmath8 is directly proportional to @xmath9 implying that @xmath10 can not be arbitrarily adjusted .",
    "that is why the minimal su(5 ) theory is now ruled out by proton decay results@xcite .",
    "one might argue that the minimal su(5 ) model is anyway not realistic since it predicts wrong relations between fermion masses e.g. @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this fermion mass problem is however easily remedied in the class of minimal so(10 ) models@xcite with a single * 10 * and @xmath5 field mentioned above . in view of the fact that it is also quite predictive in the neutrino sector@xcite , it is tempting to consider this as the minimal gut comparable to what su(5 ) gut was in the 1980 s",
    ". it is then important to look for its predictions for proton decay . to be sure , this model like minimal su(5 ) ( and the standard model ) does not explain the origin of the yukawa couplings ; however if this model is confirmed by experiments , understanding the yukawa sector will be the next order of business .",
    "unlike the su(5 ) model , the @xmath13 interactions in generic so(10 ) models@xcite involve more gut scale symmetry breaking parameters than just the color triplet higgsino mass ; therefore the situation for proton decay here is less restrictive .",
    "in particular , in the minimal so(10 ) models of the type discussed in ref.@xcite , there are four free parameters@xcite whereas there are about 16 decay modes which have lower bounds on their partial life times .",
    "it was shown through a numerical analysis@xcite ( without including @xmath14 operators ) that there exists a very small region in these parameter spaces for @xmath15 operators , where all the present experimental constraints are satisfied for lower @xmath0 .    in this paper , we study the proton decay constraints on so(10 ) models with @xmath16 higgs fields . we show that present proton decay constraints combined with fermion masses and mixings imply a specific relation among so(10 ) breaking vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and a very specific form for the yukawa textures .",
    "roughly , they imply that the proton decay operators are proportional to the product of two up - type quark yukawa couplings i.e. @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 as in su(5 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "proton decay is not only suppressed for the left - handed quark contributions but also for right - handed ones and furthermore , the suppression works also for large @xmath0 values as well which makes this model easily distinguishable from other simple gut models .",
    "in addition , it leads to definite predictions for the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath1 and the dirac phase @xmath19 .",
    "we also show the essential role played by the * 120 * in the suppression of proton decay when all operators are taken into account .",
    "these are the new results of this paper , which have important implications for the viability of the minimal so(10 ) model for neutrino masses with ckm cp violation .",
    "we start by introducing the yukawa interactions and the contents of higgs fields in the so(10 ) model .",
    "the yukawa superpotential involves the couplings of @xmath20-dimensional matter spinors @xmath21 ( @xmath22 denotes a generation index ) with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) dimensional higgs fields : @xmath28 the yukawa couplings , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are symmetric matrices , whereas @xmath31 is an anti - symmetric matrix due to so(10 ) symmetry .",
    "one @xmath32 higgs multiplet @xmath33 is also introduced as a vector - like pair of @xmath25 whose vev reduces the rank of so(10 ) group .",
    "this helps to keep supersymmetry unbroken down to the weak scale . in order to break so(10 ) symmetry down to the standard model ,",
    "we employ one @xmath34 higgs field ( @xmath35)@xcite which also contains a pair of higgs doublets ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "altogether , we have six pairs of higgs doublets : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where superscripts @xmath39 , @xmath40 of @xmath41 stand for su(4 ) singlet and adjoint pieces under the @xmath42su(4)@xmath43su(2)@xmath44su(2 ) decomposition .",
    "the mass term of the higgs doublets is given as @xmath45 , and the expression of the matrix @xmath46 is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the mass matrix of the higgs doublets is diagonalized by unitary matrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 .",
    "we assume that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a higgsino mass in the mssm and the mass scale is much smaller than the gut scale . since we concentrate on the structure of yukawa couplings",
    ", we do not need to specify the dynamical reason of the mass hierarchy in this letter , but we just require a fine - tuning such as in the case of minimal su(5 ) model@xcite .",
    "the mssm higgs doublets are given as linear combinations : @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "we use  y diagonal basis \" ( or su(5 ) basis ) to describe the standard model decomposition of the so(10 ) representation@xcite .",
    "the expression of the yukawa interaction under the @xmath54 decomposition can be derived from ref.@xcite .",
    "the decomposed yukawa interactions which give fermion masses are written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the quark and lepton fields for the standard model , which are all unified into one spinor representation of so(10 ) .",
    "we obtain the yukawa coupling matrices for fermions as @xmath57 where the subscripts @xmath58 denotes for up - type quark , down - type quark , charged - lepton , and dirac neutrino yukawa couplings , respectively and @xmath59 the majorana mass matrices for both left- and right - handed neutrinos are proportional to the coupling @xmath30 . in this letter",
    ", we will be using type ii seesaw@xcite .",
    "next we consider dimension five operators induced by higgs triplets .",
    "the dimension five operators ( @xmath15 and @xmath14 operators ) , @xmath60 are obtained by integrating out the triplet higgs fields , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the quantum numbers under su(3)@xmath63su(2)@xmath63u(1)@xmath64 of the field @xmath65 is @xmath66 . in the expression of @xmath65 , the fields with ` @xmath67 ' are decuplet , and the others are sextet under su(4 ) decomposition .",
    "the @xmath14 operator , @xmath68 , is also generated by other colored triplet , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where the quantum number of @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "the mass term of the higgs triplets are given as @xmath73 .",
    "the mass matrices , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , are 7@xmath637 and 2@xmath632 matrices respectively , and their explicit forms are given in the literature@xcite .",
    "the yukawa couplings which cause proton decay are written as @xmath76 the dimension five operators are written by the yukawa couplings @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 as follow : @xmath77 the common coefficient @xmath78 is given as @xmath79 .",
    "we obtain the other coefficients as the following : @xmath80 where subscript @xmath81 of the matrix @xmath74 is omitted .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath82 , namely their signatures are opposite between @xmath15 and @xmath14 operator .",
    "this is derived from the fact that @xmath83 and @xmath84 have opposite d - parity .",
    "the coefficients @xmath85 , @xmath86 are generated by @xmath71 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the eqs.([llll]-[rrrr2 ] ) are explicit forms of the dimension five operators , but we present here more convenient forms to describe proton decay .",
    "the higgs triplet mass matrix @xmath74 is diagonalized by two unitary matrices , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , as @xmath92",
    ". then we obtain the useful formula for dimension five operators @xmath93    one can make consistency checks to verify the formula by considering specific vacua of the theory .",
    "for example , in the su(5 ) limit , when only one of the colored triplets is much lighter than the others , i.e. @xmath94 @xmath95 , we can obtain the following relations for the diagonalizing matrices from the explicit form of the higgs mass matrices with the su(5 ) vacua in the ref.@xcite : @xmath96 as a result , @xmath97 with @xmath98 , @xmath99 for the yukawa matrices in eqs.([y_u]-[y_nu ] ) and thus , as expected , we get the su(5 ) relations , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and the dimension five proton decay operators can be written in terms of the yukawa couplings as @xmath102    one can also obtain the flipped - su(5 ) limit@xcite in a similar manner and find the relations , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 one can also consider other typical vacua such as the one corresponding to @xmath54 . on this vacuum",
    ", we have @xmath106 and all four fermion yukawa couplings are unified as @xmath107 , which is not viable for phenomenology .",
    "in any case , since the doublet and triplet higgs fields are not unified in one multiplet on this vacuum , proton decay operator can not be written in terms of fermion yukawa couplings contrary to the su(5 ) and flipped - su(5 ) limit .",
    "the operators @xmath108 in the @xmath54 limit are symmetric under the interchange of indices @xmath109 and @xmath110 in addition to the symmetry under the exchange of individual indices @xmath22 and @xmath111 .",
    "one can write down the dimension five operators as @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "it is important to stress that there are relatively opposite signatures for the @xmath30 contributions between @xmath114 and @xmath68 .",
    "this is due to d - parity , which we have already mentioned .",
    "let us now investigate the conditions required to suppress the proton decay rate in the minimal so(10 ) model described above .",
    "we first note that the four - fermion proton decay operators are produced by gaugino and higgsino dressing of the dimension five operators .",
    "the four - fermion operators of @xmath15 type get dominant contribution from wino exchange and therefore retain the same flavor structure as that of the original dimension five supersymmetric operator ( we have assumed universality of scalar masses for suppressing fcnc processes ) . however , as far as the @xmath14 operators are concerned , they receive contributions only from higgsino exchange which can involve the top quark and @xmath115 lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "for instance in the case of su(5 ) model , the contribution of the @xmath14 operator to the decay mode @xmath116 gets so enhanced because of this that it exceeds the current experimental bound for any @xmath0 as long as stop mass is less than around 1 tev@xcite .",
    "since the original yukawa couplings @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are functions of fermion yukawa couplings @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath117 via eqs.([y_u]-[y_e ] ) , their textures are roughly determined from the experimental inputs of quark and lepton masses and mixings .",
    "for instance , to fit the strange quark and muon masses , bottom - tau unification , relations among ckm mixings and also large mixings of neutrinos , the coupling @xmath30 is almost determined to have the form @xmath118 , where @xmath119 . a naive implication of this",
    "is that since up - type quark masses are more hierarchical than down - type ones ( i.e. @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) , the expression for the up - type yukawa matrix , @xmath6 , in eq.([y_u ] ) requires the following two typical choices : ( a ) there is cancellation among @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , or ( b ) @xmath29 itself has a hierarchical form similary to the up - type quark masses .",
    "the first choice ( a ) is the case where [ 1,2 ] block of @xmath122 is not far smaller than @xmath123 , but @xmath124 are chosen to be certain values to make @xmath125 , @xmath126 are hierarchically small .",
    "the second choice ( b ) corresponds to the case where @xmath127 .",
    "the second choice appears to be required to suppress the proton decay .",
    "let us discuss the reason .",
    "in order to suppress the decay rate , we need small couplings for first and second generations in the expressions in eqs.([llll]-[rrrr ] ) .",
    "clearly this would also require a cancellation among @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 if we take the first choice ( a ) .",
    "since in general the coefficients @xmath128 in up - type yukawa matrix and @xmath129 and @xmath130 in proton decay operators are unrelated , one must find a situation where both cancellations can be achieved in a satisfactory manner so as to be consistent with all data .",
    "however , if we take the choice ( a ) , the cancellation can not happen naturally due to the following reasons .",
    "first , let us discuss the @xmath5 higgs contribution . since there is an opposite signature for one of the coefficients in the @xmath15 and @xmath14 operators , @xmath82 , the cancellation required to obtain small yukawa coupling for @xmath6 by tuning @xmath131 can not simultaneously suppress both @xmath15 and @xmath14 operators .",
    "thus , in general , it is hard to suppress proton decay rate by tuning @xmath5 colored higgs mixing @xmath132 .",
    "next let us see the contribution from @xmath26 higgs field .",
    "the coefficient @xmath133 is symmetric in the indices @xmath110 due to su(3)@xmath63su(2 ) contraction . therefore @xmath31 contribution is absent for the @xmath134 part in @xmath15 operator ,",
    "whereas it is of course present in the fermion masses .",
    "thus , if the cancellation in @xmath6 happens by tuning @xmath135 , such cancellation will not help in suppressing the @xmath15 operator .",
    "the above discussions lead to the fact that the proton decay rate can not be suppressed in natural way if we take the choice  ( a ) . as we will see numerical studies later",
    ", we require a fine - tuning to the level of 0.01% to suppress all the proton and neutron decay modes when we consider general parameter fitting in the choice ( a ) .",
    "the choice  ( b ) ( @xmath136 ) is necessary to achieve natural suppression of proton decay as a result .",
    "we now show how the proton decay rate in the choice  ( b ) is suppressed rather than the minimal su(5 ) . if @xmath136 , the @xmath15 dimension five operator can be a form as @xmath137 and in the @xmath14 operator @xmath138 , @xmath110 part is also related to @xmath6 .",
    "this will correspond to the case where @xmath139 .",
    "we will give an example later where this can happen but first we note that for the case just noted , the @xmath14 contribution to @xmath140 mode is suppressed compared to the usual su(5 ) models for the entire range of tan@xmath141 up to @xmath142 . here , the dominant contribution is proportional to @xmath143 giving a suppression factor @xmath144 for @xmath145 compared to minimal su(5 ) case .",
    "similarly , since the @xmath110 part of @xmath114 are also related to the @xmath6 instead of @xmath7 , the @xmath15 contribution to the @xmath146 is also suppressed even for @xmath147 , compared to the su(5 ) model ( since @xmath148 ) .",
    "however as it turns out , these suppressions are not enough .",
    "we need to specify the yukawa texture for the purpose as we see below .    before describing the specific choice of yukawa textures ,",
    "let us show the numerical values for the proton decay amplitude to confirm that @xmath149 is necessary to satisfy the current experimental bounds naturally . rewriting the proton decay amplitude as @xmath150",
    ", we define @xmath151 the coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath129 are given in eq.([llll ] ) .",
    "the @xmath14 contribution can be written in the same way . to satisfy the current proton and neutron decay bounds , we need @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 if the colored higgsino mass is @xmath155 gev , and squark and wino masses are around 1 tev and 250 gev , respectively . in order to satisfy those bounds naturally ,",
    "we need @xmath156 .",
    "if @xmath157 , we need to tune @xmath129 and @xmath130 for every decay mode to cancel @xmath158 , which is unnatural .",
    "( further , assuming @xmath159 can not make successful suppression of the decay amplitude since in that assumption we also need to suppress @xmath160 which can only be suppressed for @xmath161 ) .",
    "the @xmath162 depends on the magnitudes of the elements from the [ 1,2 ] block of @xmath163 which is determined from the fit to the up - type yukawa as a function of @xmath164 and @xmath165 . in table",
    "[ tabr2r3 ] we show the @xmath162 component in the proton decay amplitude for different values of @xmath165 and @xmath164 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath162 is calculated in the basis where @xmath167 . as we can see from the table , that @xmath162 can be very large ( for large @xmath124 ) and this requires very high level of fine - tuning for all the decay modes ( including charged leptonic decay ) to suppress nucleon decay as we noted .",
    "the smallness of @xmath168 and @xmath165 is required to suppress @xmath162 . however , even in the case @xmath169 , the @xmath162 amplitude is not enough suppressed ( @xmath170 ) and we still need fine - tuning among the coefficients to satisfy the data . this is mainly because @xmath171 are not enough small to satisfy @xmath172 .",
    "we now present the specific choice of yukawa texture to suppress the proton decay rate further .",
    "the texture is given as @xmath173 diag@xmath174 , so that up and charm quark masses arise from contributions of @xmath30 and @xmath175 : @xmath176 where @xmath119 .",
    "in this texture , @xmath177 , and @xmath164 is fixed as @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) to generate the correct charm mass .",
    "we have @xmath180 @xmath181 ( nonzero value of @xmath164 is therefore allowed ) to ensure small values of @xmath182 , and @xmath183 generates the down - quark mass and cabibbo angle @xmath184 with @xmath185 .",
    "the up - quark yukawa coupling is generated as @xmath186 , and we also have a relation @xmath187 , where @xmath188 in the preferred vacuum for the @xmath26 higgs coupling , eq.([su5 - 5 ] ) . in the basis where @xmath6 is diagonal , @xmath158 in this texture",
    "is not completely zero but can become much smaller than @xmath189 .",
    "we comment that we also need to examine the contribution of the other components e.g. @xmath190 after we suppress the @xmath162 .",
    "however , their contributions are associated with the colored higgs mixing angles , which are inputs and can be suppressed by our choice of the vacuum expectation values and the higgs couplings . according to our numerical studies",
    ", some of the mixing angles must be about a few percent in the case of @xmath147 to suppress the decay .",
    "however , the mixing angles can become larger as @xmath0 becomes smaller .",
    "details will be given in a future paper@xcite .    without the particular choice of texture , as mentioned above , the proton decay can not be suppressed naturally in these models unless the @xmath0 is very small .",
    "the proton life time for @xmath191 for this choice of texture can be larger than the current experimental bound , @xmath192 years for any @xmath0 ( using the lightest colored higgsino mass to be @xmath193 gev and squark mass scale around 1 tev ) .",
    "all other nucleon decay modes are suppressed as well . in our calculation , we use long- and short - distance renormalization factor , @xmath194 and typically @xmath195 similar to ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is plotted as a function of @xmath164.,width=302 ]     @xmath2 is plotted as a function of @xmath164.,width=302 ]    given the above texture for yukawa couplings , we find that @xmath1 is restricted to a range . in figure [ ue3 ] , we plot @xmath1 as a function of @xmath164 with @xmath196 ( as required in the most preferred texture ) and the value at @xmath197 is most important .",
    "we find that @xmath1 is between 0.07 to 0.09 .",

    "the presence of @xmath175 is a necessity to suppress proton decay ( suppress @xmath158 ) and fit the fermion masses .",
    "this @xmath175 also helps to explain ckm cp violation@xcite .",
    "finally , we show how the above proton decay suppression arises by an adjustment among different vevs ( or symmetry breaking parameters ) . in the above",
    ", we need to have @xmath201 in the eq.([y_u ] ) . since this is satisfied in eq.([su5 - 5 ] ) for the su(5 )",
    "condition , it may be a hint that we stay close to the su(5 ) symmetric vacuum .",
    "secondly , we need @xmath202 while suppressing @xmath5 colored higgs contribution to proton decay , namely only @xmath203 is enhanced while other mixings for the sub - multiplets in @xmath5 are small , @xmath204 in order to explain how these conditions may be satisfied in the minimal so(10 ) model , we denote the vevs of the submultiplets in @xmath34 multiplet that break so(10 ) symmetry as follows : @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 ( where numbers in the parenthesis denote @xmath54 quantum numbers ) .",
    "the vevs @xmath208 are around the unification scale of three gauge couplings .",
    "recall that in the su(5 ) symmetric vacua@xcite , the @xmath208 s satisfy the following relation : @xmath209 ( we have used the same normalization as in the ref.@xcite ) .",
    "they lead to the su(5 ) relations ( [ su5 - 1]-[su5 - 4 ] ) .",
    "now we perturb the higgs potential with a small coupling , @xmath210 .",
    "we obtain @xmath211 ( where @xmath212 is associated with @xmath213 term ) .",
    "if @xmath214 , we have @xmath215 .",
    "we obtain the higgs mixings @xmath216 where @xmath217 is a coupling of @xmath218 term .",
    "we also have similar terms for @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "all these terms have different denominators .",
    "all the higgs mixing angles tend to zero in the limit @xmath222 .",
    "however , suppose that @xmath223 is satisfied , only @xmath203 can be of finite value , all other mixing angles are zero and eq.([constraint ] ) is satisfied .",
    "on such a vacuum , the proper strange quark and the muon masses can be realized by an enhancement of @xmath203 , and yukawa coupling of up - type quark , @xmath6 , is almost proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "this is just an example , and in our detailed quantitative work , we keep all other terms in the higgs potential and we satisfy eqs.([su5 - 5],[constraint ] ) to suppress the proton decay rate .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the fermion masses and dimension five @xmath224 operators in the minimal so(10 ) model with * 10 * , @xmath5 and * 120 * higgs fields coupling to matter .",

    "<S> we show that in a class of minimal supersymmetric so(10 ) models which have been found to be quite successful in predicting neutrino mixings , all proton decay modes can be suppressed by a particular choice of yukawa textures . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression works for contributions from both left and right operators for nucleon decay and for arbitrary @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the required texture not only fits all lepton and quark masses as well as ckm parameters but it also predicts neutrino mixing parameter @xmath1 and dirac cp phase @xmath2 to be 0.07 - 0.09 and 0.3 - 0.7 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the relation between the gut symmetry breaking parameters for the origin of these textures . </S>"
