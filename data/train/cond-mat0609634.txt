    "the mn@xmath12-rich insulating compounds , la@xmath3a@xmath4mno@xmath5 ( a = sr , ca , @xmath13 ) have attracted considerable interest in recent years for their inhomogeneous magnetic ground states,@xcite and complex structural phase diagrams,@xcite believed to be consequences of competing magnetic , lattice , and coulomb interactions.@xcite with regard to transport properties , there is general consensus that the charge - carriers in the high-@xmath7 paramagnetic phases of these compounds are small polarons.@xcite however , few systematic studies of the doping dependence of polaron transport in the insulating regime have been reported.@xcite the experimental situation is complicated by the sensitivity of the structural and magnetic properties to deviations in stoichiometry@xcite and the uncertain stoichiometry of specimens employed in many early transport studies .    here we present dielectric and dc resistivity measurements on a series of la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath5 polycrystalline specimens with @xmath13 that offer new insight into the role of electron correlations on the changes in ground state magnetic and crystal structure that occur@xcite near mn@xmath10 content , @xmath14 .",
    "consistent with the small - polaron picture , the doping dependence of the dielectric constant yields a bound - polaron polarizability that implies a localization length comparable to a lattice spacing . in agreement with prior work@xcite on la@xmath3sr@xmath4mno@xmath5",
    "we find that the high - temperature polaron hopping energy is independent of @xmath15 up to @xmath16 , above which it begins to decrease .",
    "particularly interesting are low - temperature measurements of dielectric relaxation and dc resistivity which indicate a polaron hopping energy that tends toward zero near @xmath16 .",
    "these results suggest that charge - carriers within the orthorhombic , canted antiferromagnetic ( caf ) phase are approaching an insulator - metal transition that is not achieved due to the emergence of the monoclinic and ferromagnetic insulating ( fmi ) phase .",
    "polycrystalline specimens of la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath17 were prepared by standard solid - state reaction under ar atmosphere ; the preparation methods , structural characterization and magnetic properties are reported elsewhere.@xcite powder x - ray diffraction revealed no secondary phases ; the average mn@xmath10 ( hole ) concentration ( @xmath18 ) was determined by iodometric titration ( see table i ) . a small and nearly @xmath19-independent oxygen excess ( @xmath20 ) in the present specimens is attributed to cation vacancies@xcite which contribute additional holes uniformly,@xcite similar to ca substitution .",
    "the structural and magnetic properties of the present specimens are consistent with those of stoichiometric compounds.@xcite    ac impedance measurements were conducted with an hp4263b lcr meter at frequencies @xmath21  100  hz , 120  hz , 10  khz , 20  khz , 100  khz using a 4-terminal pair arrangement .",
    "reliable measurements of @xmath22 were restricted to @xmath1 k where the capacitive reactance was sufficiently large ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "typical specimen dimensions were @xmath24 mm@xmath25 .",
    "silver paint electrodes were applied on the largest , polished faces of the specimens .",
    "contact capacitance can lead to apparently large values@xcite of @xmath22 and thus some care is required to distinguish the true response of the sample . to rule out the influence of contacts , the impedances of several specimens were remeasured after further polishing to reduce the electrode spacing by at least a factor of two ; in all cases the low - temperature data used to determine @xmath26 agreed within geometric uncertainties of @xmath27% .",
    "the results were also independent of applied ac voltage in the range 50mv-1v . at higher temperatures where dielectric relaxation was observed ,",
    "some dependence on the electrode spacing was evident , consistent with a contribution from contact capacitance .",
    "this issue is addressed further below .",
    "four - probe dc resistivity measurements were performed in separate experiments in air ( high-@xmath7 ) and vacuum ( low-@xmath7 ) with current applied along the long axis of the same specimens used for ac impedance .",
    "quite generally , the complex dielectric permittivity of a solid , @xmath28 , can be expressed as , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the high - frequency dielectric constant associated with displacements of ionic charge distributions relative to their nuclei .",
    "the lattice contribution , @xmath31 , arises from displacements of ions and their charge distributions .",
    "@xmath32 represents a dipolar contribution , associated in the present materials with charge - carrier hopping as discussed below .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are generally frequency- and temperature - independent at low @xmath7 .    figure  [ lcmoepsvst ] shows @xmath33 at four frequencies for five ca concentrations in the low-@xmath7 regime where @xmath34 becomes frequency and temperature independent .",
    "the intrinsic static dielectric constant @xmath35 can be determined directly from the data .",
    "the sharp increase of @xmath36 and onset of frequency dispersion with increasing temperature , signatures of dielectric relaxation , are more clearly manifested in the broader temperature range of fig .",
    "[ lcmorelax ] ( for @xmath37 ) as steps in @xmath34 and maxima in the loss factor , @xmath38 .",
    "-.3 in    a significant feature of the relaxation behavior for all specimens is that the temperatures of the maxima in @xmath39 ( denoted @xmath40 ) and inflections in @xmath33 differ substantially ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ lcmorelax ] ) .",
    "this rules out an intrinsic dipole response , for which these features occur at the same temperature.@xcite schottky barriers are to be expected at metal - semiconductor contacts with manganites.@xcite the associated depletion layers behave as a large capacitance in parallel with a resistor , in series with the bulk specimen .",
    "assuming that the contact capacitance is nearly temperature independent , the time constant of the system ( @xmath41 ) is controlled by the temperature - dependent bulk resistance of the specimen,@xcite with maxima in @xmath39 occurring for @xmath42 .",
    "consistent with this picture , freitas _",
    "et al._@xcite have demonstrated for a related manganite compound that large values of @xmath34 ( at @xmath43  k in fig .",
    "[ lcmorelax ] ) are sensitive to the type of contacts employed ( e.g. silver paint , vapor - deposited metals ) , but that the charge - carrier activation energies derived from the @xmath39 maxima are contact independent .",

    "the @xmath52 efros - shklovskii@xcite hopping form is equally satisfactory over the limited temperature range of the linear least - squares fits ( solid lines ) .",
    "high-@xmath7 resistivity data ( @xmath53  k ) in fig .",
    "[ roft ]  ( b ) are shown plotted to emphasize the adiabatic small - polaron form widely established for the paramagnetic phase of these materials,@xcite @xmath54 .",
    "solid lines are linear least - squares fits used to determine @xmath55 ; these values and those for @xmath56 are listed in table i. the jahn - teller ( jt ) structural transition is clearly evidenced by a vertical displacement of the data for @xmath57 [ arrow in fig .",

    "the jt transition for the @xmath59 specimen is expected somewhat below room temperature@xcite ; the absence of a noticeable feature in @xmath60 is consistent with the systematic broadening and eventual disappearance of features in structural and magnetic measurements with increased doping near this hole concentration.@xcite",
    "-.2 in    -.2 in    -.2 in",
    "the dependence of @xmath26 on the hole concentration , @xmath15 , is shown in fig  [ lcmoepsvsx ] . for the nominally undoped compound@xcite lamno@xmath5 , @xmath61 .",
    "a smaller value , @xmath62 , is observed for @xmath63 , and an approximately linear increase for @xmath64 . also shown",
    "are the magnetic phase boundaries defined by @xmath65 or @xmath66 from magnetization data on polycrystals from the same batches as those reported here@xcite ( squares and right ordinate , fig .",
    "[ lcmoepsvsx ] ) and neutron diffraction studies of single crystals@xcite ( circles and right ordinate , fig .  [ lcmoepsvsx ] ) .",
    "the recently clarified structural phase diagram@xcite indicates orthorhombic and monoclinic structures for the caf and fmi regimes , respectively , with a transition occurring in the range @xmath67 .",
    "let us first consider the decrease in @xmath26 at the lowest hole concentrations .",
    "this behavior is contrary to expectations based on the behavior of conventional semiconductors@xcite where the dielectric constant of the ( undoped ) host lattice ( @xmath68 ) is enhanced at low temperatures by the presence of electrons or holes bound to donor or acceptor impurities , respectively .",
    "local fields produced by charged defects , la and mn vacancies , and excess oxygen,@xcite can influence the polarizability associated with bound holes in the ground state .",
    "the observed decrease in @xmath26 by @xmath69  % would require a corresponding decrease in the acceptor polarizability due to differences in the long - range magnetic and/or orbital structure of the a - type af and caf states .",
    "the increase of @xmath26 for @xmath70 is consistent with a growing contribution from holes bound to acceptors in the present materials ( ca or excess oxygen ) .",
    "an estimate of the polarizability can be found from the solid line in fig .",
    "[ lcmoepsvsx ] using the dilute limit of the castellan - seitz@xcite expression , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the acceptor density and @xmath73 is the volume per formula unit.@xcite this yields @xmath74 which implies ( for hydrogenic impurities ) a bohr radius @xmath75 ( we take @xmath76 from fig .",
    "[ lcmoepsvsx ] as representative of the caf phase ) .",
    "thus the @xmath26 data imply electronic states for the bound holes that are localized at individual atomic sites , consistent with general consensus from transport studies near room temperature and above , that doped holes move as small polarons.@xcite    it is instructive to examine and compare the various polaron energies determined from our measurements .",
    "as noted above , we expect @xmath47 to represent the low-@xmath7 charge - carrier hopping energy .",
    "supporting this conclusion we find excellent agreement between @xmath47 and the hopping energy determined from the dc resistivity variable - range hopping fits,@xcite @xmath77 , where @xmath7 in this expression was taken as the average @xmath40 for each composition .",
    "figure  [ polaronenergies ] shows these energies as a function of doping .",
    "also plotted is the high-@xmath7 polaron activation energy , @xmath55 , which remains approximately constant at @xmath78  mev up to @xmath79 . at higher",
    "doping it decreases , a trend quite similar to that reported for la@xmath3sr@xmath4mno@xmath5.@xcite most striking is the behavior of @xmath80 which appears to be dropping sharply toward zero at @xmath16 , and exhibits a clear change in doping dependence for @xmath81 .",
    "the dashed curve in fig .  [ polaronenergies ] is an empirical power - law fit , @xmath82 .",
    "the inverse dielectric constant , also shown ( right ordinate , fig .",
    "[ polaronenergies ] ) , appears to follow a very similar behavior .",
    "-.12 in    @xmath83 is reminiscent of the behavior of conventional doped semiconductors@xcite near the insulator - metal transition ( imt ) , with @xmath16 the critical density .",
    "this point of view is encouraged by the observation that @xmath16 and @xmath84 are close to satisfying the mott criterion@xcite for an imt , @xmath85 .",
    "experimentally we find @xmath86 .",
    "thus the data suggest that the ground - state structural and magnetic transitions@xcite occurring near @xmath16 are a consequence of the rapidly growing charge - carrier kinetic energy as @xmath87 within the orthorhombic , caf phase .",
    "the change in orbital - ordering scheme in the monoclinic , fmi phase@xcite might be viewed as a compromise among competing magnetic , lattice and coulomb energies that suppresses the rate of growth in kinetic energy with doping , and `` delays '' the imt to higher mn@xmath10 concentration .",
    "given this low-@xmath7 picture of proximity to an imt , it is natural to hypothesize that the decrease in the high-@xmath7 small - polaron energy , @xmath55 , at @xmath81 reflects the cooperative effects of overlapping polarons .",
    "scaling behavior is to be expected near the imt , with physical properties controlled by a localization length diverging as @xmath88 , with @xmath89 a critical exponent .",
    "with@xcite @xmath90 , this yields @xmath91 , and our empirical fit ( dashed curve , fig .",
    "[ polaronenergies ] ) implies @xmath92 .",
    "though smaller than values in the range @xmath93 that have been reported for doped si and ge,@xcite this estimate of @xmath89 should be viewed with caution as a lower bound since the scaling theory applies only very close to @xmath16 where the present data are not sufficiently dense .",
    "furthermore , the inhomogeneous ground state of these materials may alter scaling behavior .",
    "this is especially likely near @xmath16 where both orthorhombic and monoclinic domains may coexist@xcite and where the coalescence of ferromagnetic clusters of nanoscopic size embedded in the caf matrix have been deduced from neutron scattering studies.@xcite    in summary , combined dielectric and resistivity measurements reveal new systematics of electronic degrees of freedom in the complex magnetic and structural phase behavior of lightly doped la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath5 .",
    "the doping dependence of the dielectric constant and low-@xmath7 hopping energies suggest that adding holes within the caf ground state drives the electronic system toward an insulator - metal transition near mn@xmath10 concentration @xmath11 . that this transition is nt realized is evidently a manifestation of competition from magnetic and lattice energies reflected in the emergence of the fmi phase .",
