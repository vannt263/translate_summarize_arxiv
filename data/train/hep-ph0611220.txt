    "in quantum field theory , ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences always emerge from momentum integration in the loops . in order to identify the physical content of the theory under consideration ,",
    "one has to subtract these divergences with a definite regularization procedure . among them ,",
    "the dimensional regularization is probably the most popular one because it is easy to use and respects all the symmetry properties of the initial lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the latter aspect is of fundamental importance and could justify by itself the choice of dimensional regularization .",
    "nevertheless , the introduction of an explicit cut - off is sometimes advantageous , for example as soon as one considers renormalization group equations in the wilsonian approach @xcite or effective theories @xcite . in that context",
    ", the problem concerning the non - respect of symmetries arises .",
    "a three - momentum cut - off has been proved to be useful , e.g. , in the case of the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) but it does not respect lorentz invariance .",
    "this can be avoided by using a four - momentum cut - off , but the latter suffers from the fact that it violates gauge invariance , too .",
    "this can be seen for instance from the fact that the one - loop photon polarization tensor in qed is no longer transverse .",
    "the problem has been solved by schwinger within his proper - time approach @xcite . however , his formalism is very different from the usual feynman diagram technique . in the literature there",
    "exists a modified version of the proper - time regularization which can directly be applied to feynman diagrams @xcite , but as shown later in this paper , the results are ambiguous since they depend on the way the propagators are written . on purely phenomenological grounds , the problem is sometimes `` solved '' by simply imposing gauge invariance at hand , i.e. , if we keep the example of the photon polarization tensor in qed , by projecting it onto the transverse part .",
    "this method is of course not very satisfactory .",
    "finally , another method which respects gauge invariance is that by pauli and villars @xcite .",
    "the masses of the fictitious particles which are introduced by this method can be interpreted in the sense of a cut - off @xcite . however , as soon as the theory allows for particles having different masses propagating in the same loop , this method becomes impractible . in conclusion , a regularization scheme with an explicit cut - off dependence and preserving symmetries would be very desirable . in this paper",
    ", we will not give the ultimate solution of this long - standing problem .",
    "however , within the context of renormalization group equations , it is often sufficient to look at the divergent parts of the integrals .",
    "a prescription to calculate these divergent parts within a cutoff scheme preserving symmetries is thus on its own an interesting problem .",
    "we emphasize in particular the importance of a consistent treatment of quadratic divergences , which in the case of qed always cancel at the end of the calculation , but which survive in other theories and can give rise to a very strong running of the model parameters within the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "we will show through several examples how we can conciliate the explicit dependence on a cut - off and the requirements of symmetry . in sect .",
    "2 , we will start by giving an example where the proper - time method fails . in sect .",
    "3 , we give a prescription which allows to conciliate all constraints .",
    "then , in the remaining sections , we will give some illustrations through several examples ( qed in sect .",
    "4 , a phenomenological chiral model in sect . 5 ) .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , there are essentially three regularization methods implying a cut - off : the naive ( three or four dimensional ) momentum cut - off , the method by pauli - villars and the proper - time one . for the reasons detailed in the introduction we are concentrating on a modified version of the latter , which can immediately be applied to the calculation of feynman diagrams . however , as we are going to show , ambiguities may arise with this method .    to be more explicit ,",
    "let us start by giving two expressions which can appear in a one loop calculation : @xmath0 although both expressions are divergent , we expect a useful regularization procedure to guarantee the equality @xmath1 .",
    "once the wick rotation is done , the proper - time regularization method as stated in the literature @xcite consists in rewriting the integrals and introducing a cut - off @xmath2 _ via _ : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the usual euler function .",
    "in this paper we are only interested in the divergent part of the integrals , i.e. the parts which stay finite in the limit @xmath5 . applying the proper - time method to ( [ int_a ] ) and ( [ int_b ] ) , one obtains for the divergent contributions : + @xmath6 i.e.",
    ", the proper - time regularization procedure breaks the formal equality @xmath1 .",
    "the logarithmic term is the same but the coefficient for the quadratic divergence depends on the way the integrals are written . of course",
    ", one might argue that rewriting ( [ int_a ] ) in two parts is not correct , since it is divergent , and decide to forbid such a manipulation for the computation of divergences .",
    "such a rule would be arbitrary but acceptable if one could be sure that the results are in agreement with all symmetry requirements .",
    "actually , we will see in the following sections that this is not the case .",
    "more generally , this example exhibits the fact that some ambiguities can arise , so that a special care has to be taken in the computation of divergences",
    ". therefore , we have to proceed differently in order to obtain a consistent dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "such a method is developed in the next section .",
    "when dealing with a quantum field theory containing scalar and vector fields , we are confronted with integrals of the typical form @xmath7 here it is supposed that feynman parameters have already been introduced , such that the `` mass '' @xmath8 might depend on several parameters @xmath9 .",
    "the integrals over the feynman parameters are omitted since they are irrelevant for our discussion .",
    "tensor integrals with @xmath10 in the numerator are transformed using @xmath11 and analogous rules in the case of more than four indices . in the case of fermion fields ,",
    "the same integrals appear after the traces over gamma matrices have been evaluated . for our purposes , @xmath12 and @xmath13 can take the values @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that the integral ( [ general_int ] ) is at most quadratically divergent .",
    "despite we want to calculate our results in @xmath16 , we leave @xmath17 unevaluated for reasons which will be explained below .",
    "the key point is not to try to regularize all these integrals separately , but to deduce them from a single one .",
    "we introduce @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 being some arbitrary parameters ( which will be taken equal to @xmath21 at the end of the calculation ) .",
    "it is easy to see that all the integrals of the form ( [ general_int ] ) can be rewritten as linear combinations of @xmath22 and its derivatives .",
    "for instance , the expressions @xmath23 and @xmath24 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ int_a ] ) and ( [ int_b ] ) can be written as @xmath25 and @xmath26    it is straightforward to show the formal relation @xmath27 and the remaining integral @xmath28 can be evaluated in @xmath16 with the help of the proper - time method @xcite @xmath29 ( the dots represent terms which stay finite for @xmath30 ) , and hence @xmath31 for reasons which will become clear later , we have not yet set @xmath16 in the prefactor @xmath32 .",
    "one could hope that , if one derived all needed integrals from this single one by taking derivatives with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , everything would be consistent .",
    "however , there still remains a subtlety as we will see now .    from eq .",
    "( [ aderiv ] ) we obtain @xmath33 and from eq .",
    "( [ bderiv ] ) @xmath34 if we set @xmath16 , we see that the formal equality @xmath1 is violated .",
    "however , we can correct this by keeping @xmath16 only in the term @xmath35 , but setting @xmath36 in the coefficient of the term @xmath37 .",
    "if we do so , the expressions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 coincide .",
    "this prescription can be generalized to all other integrals under consideration .",
    "although this prescription seems to be rather arbitrary , it allows us to obtain a consistent set of regularized elementary integrals such that the final result is independent of the way the non - regularized integrals are written .",
    "these integrals are listed in the appendix .    to generalize the preceding result to loops containing derivative couplings ,",
    "let us now consider a more complicated example : @xmath40 with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ tensorintegral ] ) and ( [ ialphabeta1 ] ) , this integral can be written as @xmath41 note that we leave @xmath17 undetermined until the end of the calculation .",
    "( [ ialphabeta2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath42 and then , following the prescription given above , we finally set @xmath36 in the term @xmath37 and @xmath16 in the term @xmath43 : @xmath44    this method seems very unusual concerning the way to treat the dimensionality of the divergences .",
    "however , veltman @xcite already noticed that quadratic divergences are associated with @xmath36 in the context of dimensional regularization , whereas the logarithmic part has to be treated in dimension @xmath16 .",
    "more recently , harada _",
    "_ used a similar trick @xcite in order to derive the renormalisation group equations for different models of hadronic effective theories .",
    "they show @xcite that one can not obtain correct results if one simply works in dimension @xmath16 during the calculation .",
    "in fact , the first integrals listed in our appendix have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by calculating them in dimensional regularization , expanding the results around @xmath36 and @xmath16 , and identifying the resulting poles according to the rules @xmath45 we mention that with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ tensorintegral ] ) and ( [ tensorintegral2 ] ) we can reproduce in this way all the other integrals in our appendix , too . within this dimensional regularization method , the remaining finite parts of the integrals can in principle be calculated , but they are independent of @xmath2 and therefore irrelevant for the renormalization group equations .",
    "although we are not giving a formal proof , the examples in the next sections show that our method satisfies symmetry requirements automatically .",
    "let us now come to the first example , the qed lagrangian .",
    "in order to test the procedure previously developed , it is important to consider a simple gauge theory .",
    "this is why we start with the regularization of the qed lagrangian in this part . with standard notations ,",
    "the lagrangian reads : @xmath46 when one writes explicitly the gauge invariance of the generating functional , one can obtain some general relations and constraints for @xmath47-points green functions , called the ward identities .",
    "one of these identities concerns the transversality of the photon correlation function represented in fig .",
    "1a .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     using standard feynman rules , it reads : @xmath48\\ , .",
    "\\label{qed_se}\\ ] ] after introducing the feynman parameters , we can rewrite ( [ qed_se ] ) as follows : @xmath49 g_{\\mu\\nu }    -2 x ( 1-x ) p_\\mu p_\\nu}{(k^2-\\delta^2)^2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 . using the integrals listed in the appendix",
    ", we finally obtain @xmath51 ( again , the dots represent terms which stay finite for @xmath30 ) , so that we recover immediately the transversality of the photon , as required by the @xmath52 gauge symmetry . a direct computation with a naive cut - off or the proper - time method does not give this result .",
    "it should also be noticed that during the calculation quadratic divergences appear , but in the final result they cancel , as it should be .",
    "another quite simple and remarkable consequence of gauge invariance is the relation between the vertex function @xmath53 and the electron self - energy @xmath54 , depicted in figs .",
    "1b and 1c , respectively .",
    "the corresponding ward identity reads : @xmath55 where @xmath56 \\gamma^\\mu \\frac{i}{p \\hbox{\\hskip -0.2 true cm}\\slash - k \\hbox{\\hskip -0.2 true cm}\\slash -m } \\gamma^\\nu\\ ] ] and @xmath57 \\gamma^\\mu \\frac{i}{p \\hbox{\\hskip -0.2 true cm}\\slash - k \\hbox{\\hskip -0.2 true cm}\\slash -m } \\gamma_\\sigma\\frac{i}{p \\hbox{\\hskip -0.2 true cm}\\slash - k \\hbox{\\hskip -0.2 true cm}\\slash -m } \\gamma^\\nu\\,.\\ ] ]    after some manipulations on gamma matrices and using the formulas listed in the appendix , one obtains @xmath58 and @xmath59 so that the ward identity connecting three - point and two - point green functions is satisfied .",
    "there are of course other ward identities to be checked , even at one loop level , but the examples given above are considered as significant tests for the consistency of our procedure .",
    "we will therefore go on to our second example , which is a phenomenological chiral model .",
    "as a last illustration , we consider in this section a model which reproduces very well the phenomenology of the hadronic vector and axial - vector correlators in the low - energy region ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this model contains @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 mesons as elementary fields . using the notations defined in @xcite , we write the lagrangian in the following form @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the scalar and pseudoscalar fields , and @xmath66 are the vector and axial vector fields . @xmath67 and @xmath68 are @xmath69 matrices related to the global @xmath70 chiral symmetry ,",
    "fulfilling the commutation relations @xmath71 = i \\varepsilon_{ijk}\\ , t_k\\ , , \\qquad [ t_i\\,,t_j^5 ] = i \\varepsilon_{ijk}\\ , t_k^5\\ , , \\qquad [ t_i^5\\,,t_j^5 ] = i \\varepsilon_{ijk}\\ , t_k\\ , .",
    "\\label{tcommutators}\\ ] ] experimental information about @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons is obtained from electromagnetic processes and @xmath72 decay data . as a consequence ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce the photon and the @xmath73 fields and thus replace the ordinary derivatives by covariant ones , following @xmath74 in order to determine the photon self - energy , one has to evaluate the different contributions depicted in ref .",
    "@xcite figures 10 and 11 .",
    "thanks to the method described in the preceding section , it is possible to show after some tedious calculations that the total @xmath75 self - energy is simply proportional to @xmath76 , as it should be .",
    "furthermore , we have explicitly checked that this result can not be obtained by a direct use of the proper - time method .",
    "another important test of our method is the goldstone theorem . if there is no explicit symmetry breaking term ( @xmath77 in our case ) , but the global symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum , then there has to be a massless particle which corresponds to the pion in our case",
    ". moreover , we have to take into account the mixing between @xmath60 and @xmath63 .",
    "this calculation is highly non trivial ; one has to evaluate all the diagrams depicted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "writing the self - energy for the pion in this model , one finally obtains in the chiral limit ( @xmath78 ) @xmath79 i.e. , the pion self - energy is simply proportional to @xmath80 and therefore does not destroy the goldstone character of the pion .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , as in the case of the photon , all quadratic divergences have canceled in the final result .",
    "the above expression for @xmath81 does not include the resummation of the @xmath82 mixing term . when including this mixing we also recover the goldstone theorem ( @xmath83 ) , but the expression for the total pion self - energy is far more complicated , such that we refrain from giving the full expression here .",
    "again , this result is non trivial and we should note that , up to now , it has only been obtained in a dimensional regularization approach ( see @xcite ) .    in all these examples",
    ", we have seen that the way of computing divergences described in the third section respects symmetry requirements .",
    "we have seen in this paper how to handle logarithmic and quadratic divergences in a cut - off regularization scheme in a consistent way , i.e. , in a way satisfying constraints from symmetry requirements .",
    "for example , we have shown that our approach was preserving the transversality of the photon polarization tensor in qed as well as the transversality of the photon polarization tensor and the goldstone theorem in the case of a phenomenological chiral model including @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 mesons . in all these examples ,",
    "the quadratic divergences cancel at the end of the calculation due to the symmetry properties of the model .",
    "recently our method has also been applied to qed with one extra dimension @xcite , where the quadratic divergences survive and give rise to a power - law in the running of the effective four - dimensional gauge coupling .",
    "we have to stress , however , that the present method is only designed to compute the divergent parts of the integrals .",
    "our aim is now to use this regularization scheme in order to derive renormalization group equations for the phenomenological chiral model described in the last section .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to incorporate the scalar degree of freedom to extend the results of harada _",
    "@xcite concerning the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge stimulating discussions with m. ericson , g. chanfray and r. stora .",
    "we present in this appendix a detailed and complete list of regularized integrals necessary for the calculation of all integrals described in the main text and in @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , only the divergent parts are given .",
