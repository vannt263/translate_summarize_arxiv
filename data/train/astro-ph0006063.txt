    "the differences and similarities between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ( hereafter rlqs and rqqs , respectively ) have kept astronomers busy for a long time . at essentially all wavelength ranges , except at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the appearance of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars is similar .",
    "rqqs appear compact with a weak radio component coinciding with the optical quasar nucleus , whereas rlqs have extended lobes of radio emission with hotspots at the outer edges of the radio structure .",
    "the radio - emitting lobes are being fed by powerful jets emerging from a bright , central core .",
    "rqqs can also have jet - like structures ( blundell & beasley 1998 ) , although with bulk kinetic powers @xmath1 times lower than for rlqs ( miller , rawlings & saunders 1993 ) .",
    "this suggests that both quasar types have jet - producing central engines , but that the efficiency of the jet production mechanism is very different in the two cases .",
    "one way to learn more about how the two quasar types are related is to study their host galaxies and their galactic environment .",
    "a longstanding belief that rqqs are hosted by spiral galaxies and rlqs by ellipticals is now being questioned .",
    "recent studies ( dunlop et al .  1993 ; taylor et al .  1996 ;",
    "mclure et al.1999 ; hughes et al .",
    "2000 ) have found that powerful quasars at @xmath2 , both rlqs and rqqs , seem to exist in galaxies above the break in the luminosity function at @xmath3 , but a clear picture has still not emerged .",
    "some studies claim a high fraction of disk morphologies amongst the radio - quiets ( e.g.  percival et al .",
    "2000 ) , whilst others suggest that nearly all quasars are in giant ellipticals ( e.g.  mclure et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the galaxy environment on scales larger than the host galaxy is also interesting .",
    "it may provide clues about quasar formation and evolution , since a period of quasar activity may be triggered by interactions and mergers ( e.g.  stockton & mackenty 1983 ; ellingson , green & yee 1991 ) .",
    "also , a comparison of the galaxy environments around different types of agn may help constrain the so - called ` unified models ' , e.g.  the orientation - dependent unified scheme where a rlq and a radio galaxy are believed to be intrinsically the same type of object , but viewed at different orientations to the line of sight ( barthel 1989 ) . in the orientation - dependent unified scheme for rlqs and radio galaxies",
    ", one expects to find that the galaxy environments around the two are the same .",
    "radio galaxies and rlqs at @xmath4 are often found in environments with richer than average galaxy density ( yee & green 1987 ; hill & lilly 1991 ; ellingson , yee & green 1991 ; wold et al .",
    "2000 ) , from groups of galaxies and poorer clusters to abell class 1 clusters or richer .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since giant elliptical galaxies frequently reside in the centres of galaxy clusters .",
    "but what is the galaxy environment like for rqqs in this redshift range , and how does it compare to the environment around rlqs with comparable agn luminosities ?    in order to make a meaningful comparison",
    "one needs a method to quantify the galaxy environment that takes into account the depth of the survey , the angular coverage and also corrects for foreground and background galaxies .",
    "one such parameter that has been much used when quantifying galaxy environments around agn is the amplitude of the spatial cross - correlation function , the ` clustering amplitude ' .",
    "yee & lpez - cruz ( 1999 ) find that the clustering amplitude is a robust estimator of galaxy richness in clusters .",
    "the first attempt at comparing the environments around radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars by using the clustering amplitude was made by yee & green ( 1984 ) .",
    "they found only a marginal difference between rlq and rqq fields , but later yee & green ( 1987 ) did deeper imaging of the same rqq fields , and added more rlq fields to the study , this time finding an even smaller difference , but they were unable to draw any firm conclusions due to the small number ( seven ) of rqq fields .",
    "the problem was later addressed by ellingson et al .",
    "( 1991b ) , who also used the clustering amplitude to quantify the environments around a sample of 32 rlqs and 33 rqqs at @xmath5 .",
    "they found the rlqs to exist in richer than average galaxy environment , and frequently also in clusters as rich as abell class 1 .",
    "the rqqs , on the other hand , were found to be much less frequently situated in rich galaxy environments , suggesting that the two quasar types may be physically different objects . since this study",
    ", there has not been much work aimed at comparing the mpc - scale environments of the two quasar populations at moderate redshifts using the clustering amplitude .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a study using the not to collect data on the fields around two samples of @xmath4 rlqs and rqqs that are matched in redshift and agn luminosity .",
    "the redshift range was chosen to extend previous work which went up to @xmath6 , to as high a redshift as possible consistent with keeping the redshifted 4000  break shortward of the @xmath7-band .",
    "we selected quasars randomly from complete flux - limited samples spanning a wide range in both optical and radio luminosity ( for the rlqs ) . by extending the redshift range of previous studies , whilst maintaining the luminosity range , we are able to better disentangle trends in the environmental richness due to cosmic evolution from those due to radio and/or optical luminosity .",
    "our assumed cosmology has @xmath8 kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the rlq sample was selected from two different radio - optical flux limited surveys , the molonglo / apm quasar survey ( serjeant 1996 ; maddox et al .",
    ", in prep . ;",
    "serjeant et al . , in prep . ) and the 7c quasar survey ( riley et al .  1999 ) and consists of 21 radio - loud steep - spectrum quasars with redshifts @xmath12 covering a wide radio luminosity range of @xmath13 .",
    "the 20 rqqs were selected from three optical surveys with different flux limits in order to cover a wide range in quasar @xmath14-band luminosity within the given redshift range .",
    "eight of the quasars are from the faint durham / aat uvx survey of boyle et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and ten of the quasars are from the intermediate luminosity large bright quasar survey by hewett , foltz & chaffee ( 1995 ) .",
    "there are also two high - luminosity quasars in the sample , selected from the bright quasar survey ( bqs ) by schmidt & green ( 1983 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the distribution of the rlqs and the rqqs in the redshift - luminosity plane .",
    "there is a slight tendency for the quasars at bright @xmath15 s to appear at the highest redshifts .",
    "the correlation between redshift and luminosity is a well - known feature in flux - limited samples , but here it may instead be an artifact of the narrow redshift range of the sample . in our analysis",
    "we investigate if there are any correlations between the environmental richness and the quasar redshift and luminosity .",
    "it is therefore important that there is no underlying correlation between redshift and luminosity in the samples .",
    "we use spearman s partial rank correlation coefficients for this analysis , allowing the correlation coefficient between two variables ( e.g.  environmental richness and radio luminosity ) to be determined when holding the third variable constant ( redshift ) . for more details about the rlq sample ,",
    "see wold et al .",
    "the rqq sample will be presented by wold et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "since we are concerned with investigating if there is an excess of galaxies in the quasar fields , we aim to have a good determination of the foreground and background counts . for this purpose",
    ", we obtained several images of random fields in the sky at approximately the same galactic latitudes as the quasar fields .",
    "there are twelve different control fields of which five were imaged in two filters . in total",
    ", they cover 18 arcmin@xmath16 in @xmath17 , 58.7 arcmin@xmath16 in @xmath18 and 73.7 arcmin@xmath16 in @xmath7 .",
    "they were imaged along with sources in the quasar sample , so they have the same depth and were obtained in exactly the same manner as the quasar fields .",
    "this is important in order to obtain a robust estimate of the galaxy clustering in the quasar fields ( yee & lpez - cruz 1999 ) .",
    "most of the data were obtained using the high resolution adaptive camera ( hirac ) at the not , equipped with either the 1k site or the 2k loral ccd giving a field of view of 3@xmath193 and 3.7@xmath193.7 arcmin , respectively .",
    "some images were also obtained using the alfosc in imaging mode , with the 2k loral ccd with pixel scale 0.189 arcsec . typically , the integrations were divided into four exposures of 600 s each .",
    "two rlq fields were imaged with the 107-in telescope at the mcdonald observatory , and five rlq fields with the hst ( serjeant , rawlings & lacy 1997 ) .",
    "the bulk of the data were obtained under photometric conditions , and the seeing fwhm is less than one arcsec in 11 out of the 14 rlq fields imaged with the not , and in 15 out of the 20 rqq fields . in several images",
    "` fuzz ' from the host galaxy is clearly visible around the stellar image of the quasar .",
    "the filters were chosen such as to give preference to early - type galaxies with strong 4000  breaks at the quasar redshifts .",
    "for an early - type galaxy at @xmath20 the 4000  break moves from @xmath18-band into @xmath7-band , so for the @xmath20 quasars we used @xmath7-band imaging and for the @xmath21 quasars we used @xmath18-band .",
    "we also imaged 20 of the quasar fields in two filters , either @xmath17 and @xmath18 , or @xmath18 and @xmath7 depending on the redshift of the quasar so as to straddle the rest frame 4000  break .    for photometry and object detection we processed the images in focas ( faint object classification and analysis system ) .",
    "by performing completeness simulations in the images we find that the data are complete down to 24.0 in @xmath17 , 23.5 in @xmath18 and 23.0 in @xmath7 , with errors of @xmath220.3 mag at the limits .",
    "all quasar fields , except two , lie at galactic latitudes @xmath23 and have galactic reddening @xmath24 .",
    "we corrected for galactic extinction using an electronic version of the maps by burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) and the galactic extinction law by cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "to quantify the amount of excess galaxies in the quasars fields we use the amplitude , @xmath25 , of the spatial galaxy  quasar cross - correlation function , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitude is evaluated at a fixed radius of 0.5 mpc at the quasar redshift , corresponding to @xmath28 arcmin at @xmath29 and has units of mpc@xmath30 .",
    "longair & seldner ( 1979 ) showed that @xmath25 can be found by first obtaining the amplitude of the _ angular _ cross - correlation function , which is directly proportional to the relative excess of galaxies .",
    "see wold et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for details of the analysis .",
    "we counted the number of galaxies within the 0.5 mpc radius in the quasar fields and averaged the counts for the @xmath18 and @xmath7-band data , i.e.  for the @xmath31 and the @xmath32 quasar fields .",
    "the average counts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we also have plotted the average galaxy counts from the control images for comparison . the two left plots in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] show the average @xmath18-band counts for the @xmath31 rlq ( 13 ) and rqq ( 7 ) fields , and the two plots to the right show the average @xmath7-band counts for the @xmath20 @xmath7-band rlq ( 6 ) and rqq ( 13 ) fields . in the rlq fields",
    "there appears to be a small excess of faint galaxies at @xmath18 and @xmath33 , whereas the @xmath18-band rqq fields show no excess .",
    "however , there is a clear excess of galaxies in the @xmath20 rqq fields at @xmath34 .",
    "the errors in the background galaxy counts were calculated as 1.3@xmath35 in order to take into account the non - random fluctuations in the counts due to the clustered nature of field galaxies .",
    "we calculated the net excess of galaxies in each quasar field by subtracting the average background counts , and thereafter computed the clustering amplitude , @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show @xmath25 for the rlq and the rqq fields as a function of redshift and quasar @xmath14 absolute magnitude .",
    "the dotted line across the plots show the value obtained by davis & peebles ( 1983 ) for the amplitude of the local galaxy - galaxy auto - correlation function , @xmath36 mpc@xmath30 .",
    "the mean clustering amplitudes for the rlq and the rqq samples are 213@xmath2266 and 189@xmath2283 mpc@xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we thus make two observations , first that the mean clustering amplitudes for the quasar fields are significantly larger than that of local galaxies , implying that the quasars exist in fields with richer than average galaxy density .",
    "second , we note that the mean clustering amplitudes for the two samples are practically indistinguishable , i.e.  _ on average , there is no difference in the galaxy environments on 0.5 mpc scales for the rlqs and the rqqs_. on average , both the rlqs and the rqqs seem to prefer environments similar to galaxy groups and poorer clusters of galaxies .",
    "the quasar environments span a wide range , however .",
    "some individual fields show no significant excess of galaxies , and other fields appear to be very rich , e.g.  the field around the rqq bqs 1538@xmath37477 with @xmath25 in the range 11001200 mpc@xmath30 and a galaxy excess of @xmath3850 galaxies .",
    "wold et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue that an amplitude of @xmath39 mpc@xmath30 corresponds to abell richness class @xmath40 1 , so the cluster candidate around bqs 1538@xmath37447 must qualify as a richness class 2 cluster .",
    "two other fields with clustering amplitudes of 785@xmath22255 and 703@xmath22250 mpc@xmath30 are probable abell class 1 clusters . plotting the galaxies in the four richest rqq fields in a colour - magnitude diagram , reveals a hint of a red sequence at @xmath411.6 , i.e.  tentative evidence that these fields likely contain galaxy clusters at @xmath420.8 , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] there are no obvious trends in @xmath25 with either redshift or quasar luminosity .",
    "there is a hint that the low-@xmath43 rqq fields have lower clustering amplitude than the higher redshift rqq fields , but this is most likely an artifact of the narrow redshift range .",
    "the spearman partial rank correlation coefficient giving the correlation between @xmath25 and redshift is 0.4 with a 1.5@xmath44 significance .",
    "looking at @xmath25 for the rlqs as a function of radio luminosity , reveals a weak , but significant , correlation between @xmath25 and radio luminosity with much scatter .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where we also have plotted @xmath25 s for rlq fields as found by yee & green ( 1987 ) , ellingson et al .",
    "( 1991b ) and yee & ellingson ( 1993 ) . here",
    "the , correlation coefficient between @xmath25 and @xmath45 , holding redshift constant , is 0.4 with a 3.4@xmath44 significance .",
    "does the correlation between radio luminosity and environmental richness imply that environment is the primary factor in controlling the radio luminosity of a rlq ?",
    "there are at least three ways in which such a situation could come about . in the first",
    ", the environment determines the bulk kinetic power in the radio jets . according to the relation between a galaxy s black hole mass and the mass of the spheroidal component ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al.1998 )",
    ", giant elliptical hosts of radio galaxies and rlqs should have high black hole masses , @xmath46@xmath47 m@xmath48 .",
    "assuming that the radio jets are powered by accretion and that the accretion rate is proportional to the black hole mass , galaxies with massive black holes will power more luminous radio sources .",
    "these massive galaxies will prefer richer environments and thus the correlation between radio luminosity and environmental richness may just reflect an increasing mass of the host .",
    "the second possibility is that more fuel for the quasar and its radio jets is available in a group or cluster environment .",
    "a group or a poor cluster environment may be ideal for the fuelling of a black hole as encounters will be more common than in the field and will be of low enough relative velocity to disrupt the interacting galaxies and cause gas to flow into the centre ( ellingson et al .",
    "1991a ) .",
    "a third possibility is that the radio luminosity is almost independent of the bulk kinetic power in the radio jets and is instead largely determined by the density of the environment into which the source expands .",
    "wold et al .",
    "( 2000 ) constructed a simple model with these assumptions and found that the predicted relation between @xmath25 and radio luminosity was much too steep to fit the data , thereby ruling out as strong a @xmath25@xmath45 dependence as we would see if all rlqs had the same jet power and environment was entirely responsible for determining the radio luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , as the luminosity function for the radio jet power is likely to be steeply declining at high powers , it seems not unlikely that selection effects could operate to produce some correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath25 without it being as strong as it would be in this rather extreme model in which the jet power is the same for all sources .",
    "given the large scatter in the correlation it is however quite possible that both environment and radio jet power play important roles in determining the radio luminosity .",
    "the relationship between radio sources and their environments must be complex , and the vast majority of radio sources may lie in some sort of cluster - like environment , from groups of only a few galaxies to clusters as rich as abell class 1 or more .",
    "given this correlation , one might expect the rqqs , with radio luminosities typically two - three orders of magnitude lower than the rlqs , to be sited in poorer environments .",
    "instead we find that the environments around rlqs and rqqs are indistinguishable .",
    "this is however fully consistent with the @xmath25-radio luminosity correlation .",
    "that the large - scale environments around rlqs and rqqs are similar suggests that the process that decides on radio loudness in a quasar is not dependent on the environment on mpc scales , but may instead be found in the central regions of the host galaxy .",
    "when an epoch of quasar activity is triggered in a galaxy , e.g.  as a result of galaxy interactions and mergers , then some central process decides whether it becomes a rlq or a rqq .",
    "if a rlq is born , the environment into which the source expands will to some extent determine its radio luminosity , and we observe the @xmath49-@xmath45 correlation .",
    "if instead a rqq is born , we do not observe any correlations between quasar luminosity ( in this case optical luminosity ) and environmental richness , because this quasar does not have extended radio lobes that can interact with the surrounding galaxy environment .",
    "the radio jets and the radio lobes extending beyond the host galaxy thus work like sensors from which we can read off the physical conditions in the intergalactic medium .",
    "the fuelling mechanism of luminous agn is still not understood , although it is thought that companion galaxies in groups and clusters may be able to supply fuel either through mergers or via a cluster cooling flow ( e.g.  hall , ellingson & green 1997 ) . the merger and cooling flow models ,",
    "however , make very different predictions for the evolutionary state of the cluster surrounding the agn .",
    "if the agn is fuelled by mergers and interactions , we might expect that the cluster is still forming by merging of sub - clumps , but in the cooling flow scenario the cluster may be well - established and virialized .",
    "we have therefore started to investigate the evolutionary states of agn - selected galaxy clusters by weak lensing techniques .",
    "using deep images obtained with the alfosc on the not in sub - arcsec seeing , we have mapped the projected mass distribution in rich , x - ray luminous agn - selected clusters , and preliminary results show that we have comfortable detections of the weak lensing signal ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "these observations will also allow us to estimate the mass - to - light ratio for the clusters , and to investigate whether the mass - to - light ratio is different than for clusters selected solely on the basis of bright optical or x - ray emission from their baryonic matter component .",
    "the weak lensing technique is being used more and more frequently since it is a powerful method for investigating galaxy clusters ( see e.g.  dahle et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "the combination of the good seeing conditions at the not and the wide field imagers with good resolution currently available and underway at the not ( the focalreducer fred ) makes the not a powerful instrument for doing weak lensing observations .",
    "we are grateful to the staff at the not and the mcdonald observatory for help with the observations .",
    "we also thank the british research council and the research council of norway for support .",
    "mw also wishes to thank the organizers of the meeting for support .",
