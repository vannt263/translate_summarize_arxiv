    "using wave - like properties of atoms for atomic interferometry has been a subject of intense and extensive study @xcite .",
    "atoms are sensitive to electromagnetic fields due to their electric and magnetic moments , their mass allows them to be deflected in the gravitational field thereby making them attractive in the measurements of inertial forces @xcite .",
    "atom interferometers have been used to measure gravitational constant @xcite , acceleration @xcite , electric polarizability @xcite and fine structure constant @xcite to very high accuracy .",
    "the technical realization of neutral - atom interferometers took some time as compared to their electron- and neutron - based counterparts .",
    "part of the reason is that atoms have large mass , resulting in a smaller de broglie wavelengths for the same velocity .",
    "also , neutral atoms can not easily propagate in dense matter unlike , e.  g. , neutrons , and therefore require more ingenious ways to coherently split and diffract the atomic beam .",
    "the first atom interferometer @xcite realized in a double - slit diffraction geometry , worked with a stream of supersonic gaseous atoms and used mechanical gratings @xcite .",
    "later experiments @xcite used standing light wave to coherently diffract the atomic beam .",
    "the standing light wave is formed using a laser beam that is detuned from atomic resonance to avoid spontaneous emission , and is retro - reflected by a mirror .",
    "the spatially - varying envelope of the standing wave creates an effective optical potential acting as a diffraction grating for atoms that can be used to split and recombine an atomic beam .",
    "another technique @xcite for diffracting an atomic beam exploits raman transitions between two hyperfine ground states of an atom via a third quasi - excited state .",
    "the laser pulses ( often called raman pulses ) , consist of two counterpropagating light beams with frequencies which are different by the bohr transition frequency between the two hyperfine states .",
    "absorption of a photon from one laser beam and stimulated re - emission into another one in this case is accompanied by a transition between the two hyperfine states .",
    "the use of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite in atom interferometers is appealing for many reasons .",
    "bec has narrow momentum distribution that minimizes the spread in momentum during the splitting and recombination of the atomic cloud and reduces the expansion of the condensate during propagation .",
    "ultracold bec can be easily manipulated and confined in a very small area on an atom chip  @xcite .",
    "finally , bec has large coherence length allowing for good fringe contrast and helping to determine any offset phases more accurately . since the first experimental demonstration of interference between two different bose condensates @xcite , several experimental techniques for the manipulation of becs and different bec - based interferometric geometries have been proposed and demonstrated @xcite .    in trapped - atom interferometer geometries",
    "@xcite the bec is kept in a trap confining the atomic cloud in all three dimensions .",
    "this trap is dynamically split into two double - well traps using a standing light wave , to create two arms which were physically separated in space .",
    "after some time , the trap is switched off allowing the condensates in each arm to fall , expand and interfere .    in guided - wave interferometers",
    "the bec is kept in a waveguide .",
    "the condensate is tightly confined in two transverse dimensions but allowed to propagate along the third dimension @xcite .",
    "the waveguide potential along this guiding dimension is typically weakly parabolic either because of difficulty of completely canceling magnetic field gradients or by design .",
    "a typical example is the michelson - type single reflection atom interferometer realized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this interferometer ,",
    "the bec cloud @xmath0 is initially at rest in a waveguide . splitting pulses consisting of a pair of counterpropagating laser beams detuned from atomic resonance and acting as a diffraction grating , are incident on the cloud .",
    "these pulses split the condensate into two harmonics , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , moving with the initial velocities @xmath3 , respectively . in a single reflection interferometer ,",
    "the directions of propagation of these harmonics are reversed at time @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the duration of the interferometric cycle ) , i.e. , in the middle of the cycle with the help of a reflection pulse .",
    "the harmonics are then allowed to propagate back and are recombined when they overlap again using the same optical pulses that were used to split the original bec cloud .",
    "after the recombination , the condensate is in general in a superposition of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 with the relative amplitudes depending on the amount of the accumulated phase shift between the arms of the interferometer acquired during the cycle .    in a double reflection interferometer @xcite",
    ", the optical reflection pulse is applied twice at times @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "after the first reflection pulse , the harmonics change their direction of propagation and start moving back .",
    "they pass through each other , and exchange their positions by the time @xmath7 .",
    "the harmonic that was on the right at @xmath4 is now on the left and vice versa .",
    "the second reflection pulse applied at @xmath7 again reverses the directions of propagation of the harmonics and , finally , they are recombined at time @xmath5 .",
    "authors of refs .",
    "@xcite investigated interferometric geometry that does not rely not on reflecting optical pulses but instead uses gradient of the confining waveguide potential for reversing direction of propagation of the bec harmonics . in this `` free oscillation '' interferometer the moving bec clouds propagate in a parabolic confining potential .",
    "they slow down as they climb the potential , stop at the their classical turning points after one quarter of the trap period ( @xmath6 ) has elapsed , and turn back . at @xmath4",
    "the clouds meet at the bottom of the potential , reach again their turning points at @xmath7 and are recombined at time @xmath5 .",
    "the duration of the interferometric cycle is thus equal to the oscillation period of the parabolic longitudinal waveguide potential @xmath5 .",
    "a mach - zehnder - type atom interferometer is another waveguide interferometer that uses bec @xcite .",
    "this interferometer shares the same operating principles with the above - discussed michelson interferometer .",
    "the difference between the two interferometers lies in their splitting techniques . in the mach - zehnder - type atom interferometer",
    "the two counterpropagating waves used for a @xmath8 splitting pulse are frequency - shifted with respect to another resulting in a traveling optical potential .",
    "this @xmath8 pulse transforms the original bec at rest into two clouds of equal amplitude .",
    "one of these clouds remains at rest and the other propagates with velocity @xmath9 .",
    "a @xmath10 pulse in the middle of the cycle stops the moving cloud and brings the one that was a rest into motion . finally , the second @xmath8 pulse applied at the end of the cycle recombines the two clouds .",
    "both in trapped - atom and guided - wave interferometers , the interference fringes depend on the relative phase accumulated by the atomic clouds in different arms during the interferometric cycle . apart from the accumulated phase shift induced by fields or interactions of interest during the experiment",
    ", unwanted phase may be accumulated due to confinement effects and interatomic interactions resulting in a decrease in visibility of the interference fringes .",
    "for example , in the single - pass interferometer @xcite , during the propagation the outer edge of each cloud feels a higher potential than the inner edge ( the outer edge is the leading edge in the first half of the cycle when the clouds move away from each other and the trailing edge in the second part when the clouds move toward each other ) .",
    "the outer edge thus accumulates a larger phase than the inner one . during the recombination",
    ", the outer edge of one cloud interferes with the inner edge of another and the phase difference accumulated due to the presence of the confinement potential leads to a coordinate - dependent residual phase across the clouds after the recombination .",
    "another mechanism for phase accumulation is due to mutual interaction of two bec clouds @xmath2 and @xmath1 when they spatially overlap . during the separation , the inner edge of one cloud interacts with atoms in the other cloud until it has traversed the entire length of the other cloud , while the outer edge of each cloud hardly interacts with any atoms in the other cloud ( and similarly during the recombination ) . as a result",
    ", the inner edge accumulates larger phase than the outer edge .",
    "the above two contributions have opposite signs but different magnitudes so the net coordinate - dependent phase is not zero .",
    "still another mechanism of accumulation of the unwanted phase is due to the fact that the velocities @xmath11 of the moving harmonics @xmath1 and @xmath2 during the reflection are different from their initial velocities @xmath12 due to the influence of the confining potential and the interatomic interactions . as as result ,",
    "the reflection pulses ( which are formed by the same pair of counterpropagating beams as the splitting / recombination pulses ) are not exactly on resonance and do not exactly reverse the clouds velocities ( the direction of propagation of each of the clouds does change but the speed before and the after the reflections is different ) .",
    "theoretical analysis of the single- and double - reflection interferometer geometries has been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , symmetric motion of the two clouds in the double - reflection geometry partially cancels the velocity errors imposed by the reflection pulses and the phase imposed by the confining potential @xcite .",
    "this conclusion has been confirmed experimentally in ref .",
    "the `` free oscillation '' interferometer provides even greater degree of cancelation of the unwanted coordinate - dependent phase since it does not rely on reflection pulses and does not suffer from the velocity mismatch effects .",
    "recent experiments @xcite where the atomic clouds were allowed to be reflected from their classical turning points instead of using reflection pulses to truncate their motion , confirmed more accurate cancelation of the unwanted phase .",
    "an additional mechanism that could lead to dephasing of the interference fringes is due to atom - atom interactions within each of the two clouds .",
    "these interactions result in the so - called phase diffusion in the bec clouds @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze effects of the atom - atom interactions within each of the bec clouds on the operation of cold - atom interferometers using optical pulses for splitting and recombination of the condensate .",
    "the basis physics of the interferometric cycle in the presence of the interatomic interactions can be described as follows : the bec which is initially in a number state with @xmath13 atoms is split by the optical pulses into two clouds moving in opposite directions .",
    "after the splitting the system is in an entangled state with each cloud being a linear superposition of number states .",
    "this superposition is concentrated around the mean @xmath14 with the relative uncertainty of the order of @xmath15 . in the presence of interactomic interactions",
    ", each number state evolves with different rate resulting in the accumulation of relative time - dependent phases between the different number states .",
    "the recombination process is sensitive to these phases and thus the interactions should influence the contrast of the interferometric fringes . specifically , we shall derive the expression for the probability density of observing any given number of atoms in each of the three output ports of the optical beamsplitter / recombiner and analyze it in different limits . both the splitting and the recombination ( detection ) of the bec",
    "are treated rigorously due to a large difference between the characteristic momenta of the condensate and the momentum imparted to the atoms by the optical beams .",
    "thus our analysis does not rely on any ad hoc assumptions about the process of detection and can be considered an analysis from the first principles .",
    "the previously - discussed effects resulting in a coordinate - dependent phase due to confinement and the interaction between the overlapping clouds are not accounted for by the present analysis , i.e. , we assume that most of the time the clouds are spatially separated .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
