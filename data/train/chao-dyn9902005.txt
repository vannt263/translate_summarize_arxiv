    "<S> we consider a damped magnetic oscillator , consisting of a permanent magnet in a periodically oscillating magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed investigation of the dynamics of this dissipative magnetic system is made by varying the field amplitude @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0 is increased , the damped magnetic oscillator , albeit simple looking , exhibits rich dynamical behaviors such as symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcations , period - doubling transitions to chaos , symmetry - restoring attractor - merging crises , and saddle - node bifurcations giving rise to new periodic attractors . besides these familiar behaviors , a cascade of `` resurrections '' ( i.e. , an infinite sequence of alternating restabilizations and destabilizations ) of the stationary points also occurs . it is found that the stationary points restabilize ( destabilize ) through alternating subcritical ( supercritical ) period - doubling and pitchfork bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the critical behaviors in the period - doubling cascades .    2 </S>"
