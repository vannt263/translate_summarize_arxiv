    "variational studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of strongly correlated systems , described by the hubbard model  @xcite and its extensions . while the last decades saw the development of the dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group  @xcite variational studies still play an important role in understanding metal - insulator transitions . in part",
    "this is due to their relative simplicity and applicability to large systems irrespective of number of dimensions .",
    "two frequently used variational wavefunctions , are the gutzwiller wavefunction  @xcite ( gwf ) and the baeriswyl wavefunction  @xcite ( bwf ) .",
    "the former is based on suppressing charge fluctuations in the noninteracting solution , the latter on projecting out fluctuations in the hoppings from a completely projected gwf .",
    "the combined use of both projectors ( baeriswyl - gutzwiller wave function ( bgwf ) or gutzwiller - baeriswyl wave function ( gbwf ) )  @xcite has recently raised the possibility of superconductivity in the two - dimensional hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "the idea of using projections based on the kinetic energy or more general operators also appears in continuous models  @xcite .",
    "the gwf can be solved exactly only in one  @xcite and in infinite  @xcite dimensions . in one dimension",
    "the exact solution of gwf is metallic , in contradiction with the exact result for the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "the gwf , however was shown to be metallic for all finite dimensions  @xcite . in higher finite dimensions high order diagrammatic treatments",
    "@xcite and quantum monte carlo  @xcite are possible . only extended versions of the gwf can account for insulating behavior : when correlations between doubly occupied sites and empty sites are incorporated ( bound excitons )  @xcite , or when the non - interacting wavefunction from which charge fluctuations are projected out is itself insulating  @xcite .",
    "for the bwf an exact analytical solution is in general not available .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the drude weight is identically zero , hence the bwf is an insulating wavefunction .",
    "if the nel state is assumed to be the wave function for infinite interaction then a solution is feasible .",
    "@xcite for the general case analytical approximations exist  @xcite , and quantum monte carlo is also applicable  @xcite .",
    "in the limit of large interaction it is known that the bwf corresponds to bound excitons and is therefore insulating  @xcite .    the gwf is often treated via a combinatorical approximation also due to gutzwiller  @xcite ( ga ) .",
    "the ga predicts a metal - insulator transition ( brinkman - rice transition )  @xcite and is exact in infinite dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the relation of the ga to the exact gwf has also been studied  @xcite . in recent work",
    "the author and co - workers suggested that the ga consists of using a simplified form for the spin correlations in the non - interacting reference wave function  @xcite .",
    "similar approaches , in which the exchange interaction is implemented in an effective way , have also been used in continuous systems to obtain approximations for correlation .",
    "@xcite extensions of the ga include the time - dependent case  @xcite , implementation for the multi - band models  @xcite , ensembles with varying particle number ( bcs wavefunction )  @xcite , and the calculation of matrix elements between ground and excited states  @xcite .",
    "the ga has also recently been applied to fermions in optical lattices  @xcite , combination with dft ( lda )  @xcite , and rpa  @xcite .",
    "an improved version of the ga was also recently proposed  @xcite . in the context of high tempereature superconductivity variants of the approximate solution",
    "have been applied  @xcite in the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) method  @xcite , which is based on a completely projected gutzwiller wavefunction .    for the bwf or its extensions ( bgwf or gbwf )",
    "there has not been an approximate solution of a similar type .",
    "the aim of this work is to develop such a scheme for the bwf and the bgwf .",
    "the assumptions in the ga for the spatial distribution are applied here in momentum space , an approximation for the @xmath2-space analog of the exchange hole , defined as @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 denotes the completely projected gutzwiller wavefunction ) is invoked .",
    "the phase diagram of the one - dimensional hubbard model is calculated .",
    "the phase transions are characterized by a decrease of the fermi step . at half - filling",
    "it is a metal - insulator transition ( the fermi step disappears ) , from an uncorrelated metal to an insulator with finite double occupations .",
    "away from half - filling the transition is between an uncorrelated metal ( fully localized in momentum space ) to a correlated metallic state .",
    "the correlated metallic state has a finite fermi step smaller than the hartree - fock solution .",
    "the double occupation tends to the value of the completely projected gwf , but double occupations due to exciton binding are present at finite interaction .",
    "excitons in metals are rare due to screening by free charge carriers .",
    "recently evidence  @xcite was found for the presence of bound excitons in single - walled carbon nanotubes .",
    "a carbon nanotube can be seen as a system of low dimensionality , hence screening can be expected to be significantly reduced , and the effects of correlations are more pronounced . in these systems the experimental absorption lineshape can not be reproduced by a tight - binding model alone , many electron effects are included via _ gw_-type approaches  @xcite .",
    "the variational ansatz presented here incorporates bound excitons via an approximate variational theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section the method is presented .",
    "in particular the ga in its original form is used as a starting point to construct a similar approximation for the bwf and the bgwf . in section [ sec : results ] the results are presented .",
    "subsequently conclusions are drawn .",
    "in this study the hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite for spin - unpolarized systems at various fillings will be investigated .",
    "the hamiltonian in one dimension can be written @xmath5 we will assume a system with @xmath6 lattice sites and with @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles with spins up and down respectively .",
    "the idea of the bwf  @xcite is to act with a kinetic energy projection operator on the completely projected gwf .",
    "the gwf is obtained by projecting out double occupations from a fermi sea , @xmath9 where @xmath10 indicates a fermi sea of non - interacting fermions .",
    "the bwf can be defined using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : psi_g ] ) as @xmath11 diagonalizing the hopping operator one can also write @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the chemical potential .",
    "the completely projected gwf at half - filling contains no double occupations . for finite @xmath15 ,",
    "however , double occupations arise as a result of the binding of neighboring up - spin and down - spin particles and their second order hopping processes , as shown by baeriswyl  @xcite .",
    "in particular baeriswyl has shown  @xcite that the polarization fluctuations at half - filling have the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the total position operator @xmath18 denotes the spin vector of site @xmath19 .",
    "this expression corresponds to bound pairs of double occupations and holes or dipoles with random orientations .",
    "double occupations arise as a result of second - order hopping processes .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the bwf is closely related to the rvb  @xcite . in the rvb a completely projected gwf",
    "is acted on by a unitary operator whose exponent consists of a sum of selective hopping processes ( increase or decrease of double occupations ) .",
    "the approximate solution of this method leads to solving a spin-@xmath20 heisenberg hamiltonian , which is also true for the bwf  @xcite . in the bwf ,",
    "however , all hoppings are included in the projection , hence away from half - filling the charge carriers can be expected to be more mobile .    the two projections detailed above can also be applied in sequence .",
    "two other variational wavefunctions can be obtained by @xmath21 with @xmath22 finite , and @xmath23 eq . ( [ eqn : psi_bg])(eq .",
    "( [ eqn : psi_gb ] ) ) is known as the baeriswyl - gutzwiller  @xcite(gutzwiller - baeriswyl ) wavefunction .",
    "below , in addition to the bwf , an approximation scheme is also developed for the baeriswyl - gutzwiller wavefunction ( bgwf ) .      in the following the essential features of the ga",
    "will be given , for details see refs . .",
    "the ga was developed to simplify the sum over determinants that arise when expectation values are evaluated over @xmath24 .",

    "the energy differences in the exponent account for the correlated hopping in momentum space . in the original ga applied to the gwf , it is the hopping energy which behaves in a similiar way : there the hopping causes a change in the number of double occupations  @xcite .",

    "( [ eqn : norm ] ) the distribution in this limit includes only the @xmath2 vectors corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues .",
