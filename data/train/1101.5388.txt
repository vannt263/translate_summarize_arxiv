    "string theory on a nontrivial background is described in terms of essentially nonlinear sigma - models . for a string to consistently propagate in the background the corresponding sigma - model must be conformal invariant .",
    "condition of conformal invariance turns out to be an equations of motion to a fields on the target space of the theory .",
    "thus there is a well - known statement @xcite : equation of motion for fields on a target space of a sigma - model is a beta function vanishing conditions for the corresponding two dimensional sigma - model . in the 80th using sigma model approach classical equations of motion were reproduced and @xmath1-corrections the equations were calculated @xcite-@xcite .",

    "it is possible to define the homotopical maurer - cartan equation , find its symmetry and explore its properties . then using suitable parametrization",
    "we have reproduced the yang - mills equation in a particular limit of the parameter .",
    "also we have identified @xmath1-correction linear in @xmath1 and have suggested a calculation method for @xmath1-corrections . though calculations using this method becomes very complicated as we are trying to find higher order @xmath1-correction , we believe that there still exists a way that is able to take into account all corrections .",
    "this approach with slight modification can be applied to the local operators inserted in the bulk of the worldsheet thus providing an interpretation of string gravity equations in the same spirit .",
    "presented approach may be seen as a `` string field theory '' in sense that local operator @xmath88 may be considered as a conformal representation of a string field .",
