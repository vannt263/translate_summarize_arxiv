    "quantum phase transitions are a remarkable zero temperature phenomenon driven by quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "such transitions have been studied in many - body quantum systems where each quantum phase can be unambiguously defined .",
    "however , recent results show evidence that interesting aspects and important traces of the physics of novel quantum phase transitions may already be observed in the limit of very few interacting sites  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly clear in hybrid light - matter systems , such as coupled electromagnetic cavities doped with two level impurities , where a mott insulating to superfluid crossover has been predicted for as few as six or seven sites  @xcite .",
    "these systems feature a composite fermion - boson excitation in each site , hence the term _ hybrid _ , and quantities like the variance in energy for each site have been used as markers for the transition between different phases  @xcite .",
    "however , entanglement , an unique quantum correlation with no classical analog which has been related to fundamental features of quantum phase transitions  @xcite , may be regarded as a more adequate order parameter  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study the system entanglement to show how such quantum correlations relate to the behaviors the system may present .",
    "one possible hamiltonian describing doped and coupled cavities is the jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) model  @xcite which , in some limiting approximations , mimics the more typical and simpler bose - hubbard one .",
    "the similarities between both models have prompted the use of the latter as a basis for the analysis of quantum phase transitions in the former both for a large  @xcite and a very small number of sites  @xcite .",
    "however , the analogy to this simpler model ignores the internal structure of each site what prevents one from exploring the increased complexity of the jch system .",
    "the implementation of such systems has been proposed in different quantum optical setups such as planar lattices of one mode cavities each containing one quantum dot  @xcite , photonic crystal microcavities  @xcite , circuit quantum electrodynamics with a finite system approach  @xcite , and in trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "one of the greatest advantages of all these setups is the combination of highly controllable experimental conditions and the large effective size of each site that allows for the design of mesoscopic simulators of condensed matter systems .    in many cases the jch system",
    "is naturally disturbed by noise that usually takes the system out of equilibrium . however , even in equilibrium , disordered imperfections in the system preparation may induce transitions that drastically change quantum phases and their correlations .",
    "disorder may manifest itself in very different and even opposite effects .",
    "the lattice imperfections , that differ from site to site , may suppress quantum coherence inducing the spatial localization of quantum states destroying the system fluidity , which leads to compressible , despite non - fluid , glassy phases  @xcite .",
    "however , disorder may induce fluidity under certain circumstances  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid nature of the system also leads to interesting effects under the action of disorder , as we show in the following sections .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the entanglement between different constituents of the jch system can be used not only to characterize the already known phase transitions , also present in the bose - hubbard model , but also , and more importantly , to identify new behavior involving the nature , either hybrid or bosonic , induced by the more complex jch interaction .",
    "we address small and large quantum systems , extremes that present similarities and differences that are of great interest : while few sites are experimentally feasible in a controllable way , phase transitions are better defined in large samples .",
    "we also analyze the entanglement and the disorder - induced effects of the jch hamiltonian . for the analysis of the small system",
    "we enter deeply in the statistics of the ensembles induced by disorder , since in principle a physical observer could perform spectroscopic measurements of the system structure and obtain the disordered pure states ( or at least quasi - pure ) pertaining to the induced ensembles . for the analysis of the large system we resort to stochastic - mean - field - theory ( smft ) , which was recently developed in  @xcite and allows us to study on site statistics .",
    "we show how the statistics of the system change under the various ways in which disorder may set in and also show the disorder - induced phase transitions .",
    "the analysis of the clean system is developed in section ii with one subsection for the small limit and another for the large limit .",
    "the disordered small system is addressed in section iii and the disordered large system is addressed in section v after a recollection of smft in section iv .",
    "section vi concludes the paper .",
    "the system studied here features a chain of sites each of which containing composite excitations , also known as polaritons , created by the interaction of a boson and a fermion .",
    "a typical experimental proposal for these systems is devised in resonant cavities , the bosons being the photons that occupy the cavity mode and the fermions being two - level electronic transitions of the onsite dopants , as depicted in figure  ( [ figure1 ] ) and described in  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of these coupled doped cavities ( with two level impurities ) is the so called jaynes - cummings - hubbard model and it is given by        @xmath0 , \\label{h_1}\\ ] ]    with @xmath1 being the number of sites , and @xmath2 being the intra site jaynes - cummings interaction between the dopant and the resonator @xmath3 the @xmath4th site annihilation operators are @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the bosonic and fermionic species , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ h_1 ] ) , @xmath7 describes the photon hoping , or tunneling , between nearest neighboring sites @xmath8.\\ ] ] the coupling strength between the two level system and the cavity in the @xmath4th site is given by @xmath9 , and the photon tunneling strength between nearest cavities is @xmath10 . the photon frequency at the @xmath4th site is @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the transition frequency of the dopant of the respective site ,",
    "thus we define the @xmath4th site detuning @xmath13 .",
    "the polaritons are eigenstates of the intra - site ( jaynes - cummings ) hamiltonian and are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "the states @xmath17 are photon number states and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the ground and excited states of the dopant inside the cavity .",
    "finally , the number of particles operator in the @xmath4th site is given by @xmath20 .",
    "recent works show that the system described in the last session undergoes a mott - superfluid phase transition when going from small hoping to large hoping or from negative detuning to positive detuning  @xcite . in the first case the transition is induced because the hoping strength circumvents the photon blockage regime ( non - linearity due to the dopant - cavity interaction ) and in the second case the excitations are directly driven from mainly electronic ( electrons are not able to hop ) to mainly photonic , hence the fluidity .",
    "this phase transition can be witnessed by single site properties .",
    "for example , when the system is isolated and the average occupation number per site @xmath21 is one ( same number of excitations and sites ) , the variance of @xmath22 for any given site is a good order parameter  @xcite : in the mott phase each site has a single particle and there is no number fluctuation whereas in the superfluid phase the onsite number variance is maximum .",
    "this analysis begins to fail when one takes into account interactions with the environment and spatial fluctuations that may not preserve the total number of particles in the system .",
    "for instance , dissipation introduces variances of the occupation number in each site and @xmath23 may overestimate fluidity .",
    "furthermore , although the measure of @xmath23 hints at the type of excitation that dominates each phase it can not reveal this fundamental property in detail because it does not fully distinguish between photons , electrons and polaritons .",
    "we proceed to show that the entanglement between different constituents not only reproduces previous results but actually allows for the identification of a new crossover that the previous analysis did not reveal .        in order to quantify the entanglement between the various components of the system we choose the negativity measure  @xcite , which is very convenient to calculate .",
    "it should be reminded that null negativity does not necessarily imply null entanglement , in fact , null negativity means null or bound entanglement .",
    "however , any non zero value of negativity guarantees some form of distillable entanglement in the system what will prove to be enough for distinguishing the different quantum phases of the system as a whole .",
    "given the quantum state of any two constituents a and b of the system , their negativity can be found by partially transposing their reduced density matrix @xmath24 and then summing up the moduli of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath25 .",
    "we begin with the case of small systems , where the diagonalization of the hamiltonian is computable , by looking at properties of the lowest energy state @xmath26 with the constraint of having equal number of excitations and sites @xmath27 . in other words",
    ", @xmath26 is the lowest energy eigenstate of the hamiltonian having @xmath28 , with @xmath22 the number operator at the @xmath4th site .",
    "consider , now , a cluster of two sites , that is the smallest possible such system . even for this very basic _ unit cell _",
    ", the entanglement between the sites clearly presents the signatures of mott and superfluid phases that were found for much larger systems in previous works . in the mott phase ( with one polariton per site ) there is no entanglement between sites with the mott insulating state being @xmath29 ( for two sites ) . in the superfluid phase and",
    "when the excitations become mainly photonic the sites become entangled , with the superfluid state for two sites ( described in  @xcite ) given by @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "it should be kept in mind that for the finite system analysis there is no phase transition , only a smoother crossover , even though the phase transition terminology is commonly adopted .",
    "the behavior of the system ( phase - like diagram ) , quantified by the entanglement between different constituents , is depicted in figure ( [ 2cavitiesphase ] ) , where we show the entanglement between sites , the in - site entanglement and the entanglement between atoms .    the site - site entanglement shows the phase crossover as partially presented in  @xcite .",
    "when the site - site entanglement is negligible the system resembles a mott - insulator and when the site - site entanglement is non - negligible the system presents superfluid - like behavior .",
    "thus the site - site entanglement indicates the regimes in which the system is insulating and superfluid with small and large values of entanglement , respectively [ figure ( [ 2cavitiesphase],a ) ] . in order to quantify the polaritonic behavior we can look at the in - site entanglement that measures how correlated are the photonic field and the electronic transition in a given cavity ( or a site)[figure ( [ 2cavitiesphase],b ) ] . in the mott - like regime ( small site - site entanglement )",
    "the in - site entanglement is significant , indicating that the system presents polaritonic behavior .",
    "deep in the superfluid - like regime ( large site - site entanglement ) the in - site entanglement is small , indicating predominant photonic behavior .",
    "however , during the crossover ( as a function of either @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) entanglement presents a non - monotonic behavior , with a region where it is maximum . such non - monotonic increase , which is even more pronounced in the atom - atom entanglement [ figure ( [ 2cavitiesphase],c ) ] , suggests that as the system size increases and reaches the thermodynamic limit a phase transition should be verifiable , i.e. since at the point of the phase transition there are fluctuations over all length scales , more degrees of freedom interact with each other such that entanglement can exist between more degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the regime in which in - site and site - site entanglement coexist corresponds to a polaritonic - superfluid , rather then just a photonic - superfluid .",
    "we can also obtain a wider view of the system phase diagram varying the number of polaritons in the system . in order to do that we can couple the system to a chemical reservoir of polaritonic particles with chemical potential @xmath33 ( at zero temperature ) , such that the system is in equilibrium with this reservoir .",
    "the chemical potential can be explicitly included in the system hamiltonian @xmath34 .    )",
    ".,width=302 ]    for large ( infinite ) systems we adopt the mean - field approach , in which we treat a small cluster of sites interacting with a mean field , that is , a classical approximation of the rest of the chain ( to which we refer to as an environment ) .",
    "this approach gives a factorable approximation of the non - factorable tunneling ( or hoping ) term by approximating the operators for their mean values plus a small fluctuation ( in this case a quantum fluctuation ) @xmath35 .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian for the cluster becomes @xmath36 \\\\+\\sum_{\\langle i ( \\mathrm{cluster}),j ( \\mathrm{environment})\\rangle}-a_{(i , j)}[\\alpha_j^{\\ast}a_i+\\alpha_ja_i^{\\dagger}-|\\alpha_j|^2],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 being the mean - field order parameter that has to be self - consistently determined by minimizing the ground state energy .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of the chemical potential and the hoping frequency is shown in figure ( [ diagramamu ] ) for large systems .    varying the chemical reservoir we can see the mott lobes ( each lobe corresponding to plateaus of different integer numbers of polaritons ) in the infinite system [ figure ( [ diagramamu ] ) ] .",
    "the mean field parameter is null in the mott phase and is positive in the superfluid phase . only in this case",
    "we compute a site purity ( one minus the purity more precisely ) as the estimate of the entanglement between such site and the rest of the chain ( in this case , the cluster ) .",
    "although this entanglement is not strictly zero in all of the mott phase it still gives a fair account of the phase diagram and the lobe structure . we have considered a four - sites cluster , which is a rather small cluster , even though it already requires a considerable computational effort .",
    "larger clusters would increase the precision of the site - cluster entanglement .",
    "the site - cluster entanglement is maximum in the lobe borders ( middle panel of fig .",
    "( [ diagramamu ] ) ) , which , again , indicates strong polaritonic fluidity in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "now , looking at the in - site entanglement ( bottom of fig .",
    "( [ diagramamu ] ) ) , which can be regarded as the very essence of the polaritons , we can see the whole picture with the overlay of the mott - superfluid and hybrid - boson crossover .",
    "the highest in - site entanglement is in the mott - lobes and the lobe structure can also be defined by this quantity . outside the lobes fluidity sets in",
    ", however the in - site entanglement is still very high indicating that the system has not yet undergone the hybrid - boson crossover despite having changed from insulating to superfluid .",
    "farther away from the lobes and deeper into the fluid phase we finally observe the in - site entanglement vanishing indicating that the system finally turns bosonic .",
    "every physical system presents imperfections ( disorder ) , that is , the system parameters may vary from site to site .",
    "there are many possible origins of disorder , for instance , imprecisions in the system manufacturing process , thermal fluctuations , and fluctuations induced by other uncontrollable electromagnetic sources in the system environment .",
    "one way to study the effect of disorder is to describe the parameters of each site as a stochastic variable @xmath38 and the hamiltonian becomes dependent on the stochastic parameters @xmath39 .",
    "naturally , the system ground state becomes dependent on the values assumed by the system parameters @xmath40 and there emerges a new state , an average state @xmath41 that contains the statistics of the effects induced by the static disorder , with @xmath42 being the distribution measure of the disorder , such that it gives all moments of the site parameters @xmath43 .",
    "we choose to analyze only uncorrelated disorder such that the global measure is a product of local measures @xmath44 , with gaussian distributions @xmath45 . the magnitude of disorder is then given by the distribution width or the mean square deviation @xmath46 .",
    "$ ] between the two sites under disorder in the matter light detuning @xmath32 ( more specifically in the light frequency ) on the phase diagram with @xmath47.,width=302 ]    we can then characterize the average properties of the system given that it presents disorder .",
    "for instance we can look at the entanglement description of the phase diagram , only now we average the entanglement over the pure state ensemble generated by the different values assumed by the system parameters .",
    "we remark that the pure state ensemble given in equation  ( @xmath48 ) is a physically realizable ensemble  @xcite , since in principle the experimentalist can perform spectroscopic measurements and obtain the values assumed by the parameters in that particular sample system and then prepare the system ground state .",
    "we can define the reduced states @xmath49 , with the trace being performed over the environment of a and b. for instance , if we are looking at the atom - atom entanglement then we trace out the field , so the field would be the environment in this case . therefore , we can define the average entanglement between any constituents a and b @xmath50=\\int dp(\\{\\xi_i\\})e[\\rho_{\\mathrm{ab}}(\\ { \\xi_i\\})],\\label{arithe}\\ ] ] which is physically realizable since the ensemble of ground states also is  @xcite .",

    "now we can describe the effects induced by disorder in each of the parameters individually , detuning @xmath32 , hoping @xmath31 , and matter light coupling @xmath56 .",
    "let us begin by analyzing disorder only in the cavity - atom detuning , thus @xmath57 ( see figures ( [ 2cavdisorder10emdelta ] ) and ( [ histoa1delta5 ] ) ) . as can be seen in fig .",

    "disorder of @xmath59.,width=302 ]    the decrease of site - site entanglement indicates that the excitations tend to localize through an anderson - like mechanism .",
    "for instance , starting with the system in the superfluid phase as we increase the detuning disorder the distribution of the single site number occupation @xmath60 is broadened and then it becomes a two peaked distribution ( see top panel of figure ( [ histoa1delta5 ] ) ) . in the regime",
    "in which the distribution @xmath60 presents two peaks the system is fully localized , such that one of the peaks corresponds to all excitations in cavity one and the other corresponds to zero excitations in the cavity .",
    "this extreme regime of localization can be regarded as a bosonic bunching : the large disorder in the cavity line width allows for realizations in which the cavity has a very low frequency such that it is energetically favorable to fit more than one excitation in one cavity instead of distributing the excitations over the sites . for two sites and two excitations",
    "the state can be approximately given by @xmath61 or @xmath62 with the atoms in their ground states .",

    "however as disorder increases there emerges a second peak close to the minimum value corresponding to localized states .",
    "thus the ensemble presents both superfluid and insulating _ states _ for intermediate values of disorder .",
    "the presence of the two sorts of states can be regarded as a precursor of a glassy phase  @xcite , which we will show to be true with the large system analysis .",

    "carrying out the same analysis as for disorder in the detuning , we see that the average site - site entanglement increases in the region where a mott phase exists in the clean limit , while it remains practically unaltered in the superfluid phase .",
    "fluctuations in the hoping may actually induce a glassy fluid phase  @xcite , that is , disorder allows realizations in which the hoping is stronger than the photon blockade and those realizations may prevail . the @xmath31-disorder may also suppresse the polaritonic behavior which can be seen as a decrease in the atomic population .",
    "we can also look at the distribution for the total atomic excitation @xmath66 as a function of disorder starting from the system at the mott phase in the clean limit .",
    "the distribution @xmath67 is very asymmetric and as disorder increases it concentrates at the extreme values assumed by @xmath68 .",
    "one of the extremes corresponds to polaritonic superfluidity and the other to photonic superfluidity , with the latter prevailing in the limit of very large disorder .",
    "this can be corroborated by the entanglement distribution @xmath63)$ ] .",
    "finally we analyze disorder in the matter light coupling @xmath56 ( see figure ( [ histoa1delta5emg ] ) )",
    ". a first look at the @xmath56-disordered average entanglement ( not shown here since it resembles very closely the @xmath32-disorder case ) suggests that disorder in the jaynes - cummings coupling also induces localization , that is , disorder allows a great number of meaningful realizations in which the sites are almost unentangled and the excitations tend to bunch . however , the @xmath56-disorder induced distribution of the site occupation number @xmath60 ( top panel of fig .",
    "( [ histoa1delta5emg ] ) ) is very different than the one induced by @xmath32-disorder ( which we showed that presents localization ) . in the current case",
    "the @xmath60 distribution shows three peaks , the extreme ones corresponding to bunching similar to the @xmath32-disorder case , and a middle one that corresponds to states in which the excitations are still equally distributed among the sites .",
    "disorder in the matter - light coupling induces states with mott - like features in which the site - site entanglement vanishes ( see middle panel of the figure ) .",
    "in fact , this is the meaning of the middle peak in @xmath69 : some sites undergo a superfluid - insulating transition through a mott - like mechanism . since the distribution of the atomic occupation @xmath67 ( bottom panel of fig .",

    "in fact , a different situation was analyzed in  @xcite , in which there is disorder in the number of impurities per cavity .",
    "since the number of atoms fluctuates then the intensity with which light couples to matter also fluctuates , and it was shown in  @xcite that such disorder induces glassy phases .",
    "interestingly , even small versions of the quantum system present evidence of many diverse phases and behaviors expected only for larger quantum systems , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "to address the physics of large disordered quantum systems we apply a recently developed technique , namely stochastic - mean - field - theory ( smft )  @xcite .",
    "this method has been shown to provide appropriate descriptions for the effects of disorder without over estimating coherence and fluidity and has already been successfully applied to the disordered bose - hubbard model  @xcite .",

    "the results presented in this section will allow us to conclude that the asymptotic effects of disorder ( very large disorder ) in the thermodynamical limit are very similar to the effects in small samples of the system .",
    "however , there are some significant quantitative differences , for instance , there are in fact phase transitions induced by disorder in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "it should also be pointed out that our approach is a bit different in this section . from now on we work with single - site mean - field - theory rather than cluster - mean - field - theory , and we follow this strategy to avoid higher computational demands .",

    "another difference between the approaches for small and large samples is that in the first case we fix the number of excitations in the system and it does not change as disorder increases .",
    "this is not the case in the present section , and in fact , the total number of excitations may change as a function of disorder .    using the smft approach we are able to perform an analysis of the thermodynamical limit .",

    "even though both the detuning and coupling disorders induce insulating behavior , it should be pointed out they do it through very different physical mechanisms .    in the detuning case cavities",
    "may be in lower frequencies in many sites which allows for more photons to localize ( even several photons per cavity ) . in the coupling case the strength of the polaritonic nature may be increased in cavities that are strongly coupled to their corresponding matter components inducing mott behavior . and as we can see in figure ( [ smfthistemg ] bottom left ) in comparison with fig .",
    "( [ smfthistemd ] bottom left ) the distribution for the cavity population does not present the higher order peaks , only the ones corresponding to zero or one polariton per cavity .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that the sites with strong matter - light coupling prevent the accumulation of larger numbers of particles per site ( mott mechanism ) .    adding the information provided by the entanglement and atomic population distributions",
    ", we have found that a fraction of the sites assumes the mott behavior and the rest are localized or even empty .",
    "thus , we corroborate the small system analysis that suggests that the system behaves very similarly to the anderson - mott insulator  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , strikingly interesting that in one case ( disorder in the detuning ) it is the low frequency sites that dominate the resulting statistical behavior and in the other case ( disorder in the matter - light coupling ) it is the strongly coupled sites that dominate , even though the distribution of the disorder parameter is gaussian and unbiased .",
    "we were able to characterize the phase diagram and the mott - superfluid transition of small and large samples of the jaynes - cummings - hubbard hamiltonian using entanglement measures between the various possible partitions of the components of the system .",
    "in particular , we showed that these non - local measures identify more clearly where the transition happens . furthermore , and more importantly , we also showed that entanglement measures distinguish which type of excitation dominates each phase which in turn allowed us to identify a crossover that is particular to this hybrid system and does not have a purely bosonic analog .",
    "this behavior splits the superfluid regime into two , the first one dominated by polaritons and the second is purely photonic .    for the disordered system we have shown that the simple statistical treatment of small systems can be quite instructive and allows us to draw conclusions that can be corroborated by the large system limit .",
    "we have shown that disorder both in the light - matter detuning and light - matter coupling induce insulating phases , however they do it through very different physical mechanisms .",
    "the former allows for photonic localization and bunching , the latter induces mott behavior in a fraction of the sites that prevents the bunching .",
    "furthermore , the cavity - cavity coupling disorder induces a glassy fluid phase .",
    "the rich in - site structure of the system leads to these diverse disordered phases with very different statistics and physical meanings .",
    "a great amount of work remains to be done on the characterization of the jch system . as a valuable point",
    "we suggest that an appropriate and efficient method should be applied to the study of the large hopping limit ( with and without disorder ) in which the mean field approach adopted here is limited by the truncation of the state space .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning once again the mesoscopic aspect of the systems proposed to implement the jch hamiltonian as well as the increasing ability to manipulate the different parameters of these systems , sometimes even at an individual level .",
    "these properties suggest that it will be possible to carry on a thorough experimental investigation of the effects of disorder and its relation to phase transitions and entanglement in many body physics in the near future .",
