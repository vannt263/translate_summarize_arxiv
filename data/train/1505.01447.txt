    "in the past 20 years there was a considerable interest in studying the principle of _ unlikely intersections _ in arithmetic geometry ( for a comprehensive discussion , see the book of zannier @xcite ) .",
    "informally , this principle of unlikely intersections ( of which special cases are both the andr - oort and the pink - zilber conjectures ) predicts that each time an intersection of an algebraic variety with a family of algebraic varieties is larger than expected , then this is explained by the presence of a rigid geometric constraint .",
    "motivated by a version of the pink - zilber conjecture for semiabelian schemes , masser and zannier ( see @xcite ) proved that in a non - constant elliptic family @xmath8 parametrized by @xmath9 , for any two sections @xmath10 and @xmath11 , if there exist infinitely many @xmath9 such that both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are torsion points on @xmath8 , then the two sections are linearly dependent .    motivated by a question of zannier , baker and demarco @xcite proved a first result for the unlikely intersections principle in the context of algebraic dynamics .",
    "more precisely , baker and demarco showed that for an integer @xmath14 , and for two complex numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 , if there exist infinitely many @xmath17 such that both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are preperiodic under the action of @xmath18 , then @xmath19 . baker and demarco",
    "s result @xcite can be seen as an analogue of masser and zannier result @xcite ( which can be reformulated for simultaneous preperiodic points in a family of latts maps ) _ without _ the presence of an algebraic group .",
    "the absence of an algebraic group in the background is an added difficulty for the problem , which is solved by baker and demarco employing an argument which relies on a theorem regarding the equidistribution of points of small height for algebraic dynamical systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "new results followed ( see @xcite ) extending the results of @xcite to arbitrary @xmath20-parameter families of polynomials .    in @xcite ,",
    "baker and demarco posed a very general question for families of dynamical systems , which is motivated by the classical andr - oort .",
    "as a parallel to the classical andr - oort conjecture , baker and demarco s question asks that if a subvariety @xmath21 of the moduli space of rational maps of given degree contains a zariski dense set of _ special points _",
    ", then @xmath21 itself is _ special _",
    "( i.e. , cut out by critical orbit relations ; see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the _ special points _ of the moduli space in baker - demarco s question are the ones corresponding to _ postcritically finite ( pcf ) maps _",
    "@xmath22 , i.e. each critical point of @xmath22 is preperiodic . in this article",
    "we prove a general result for curves supporting this dynamical andr - oort conjecture .",
    "[ main theorem ] let @xmath23 be an irreducible algebraic plane curve defined over @xmath24 , and let @xmath7 be an integer .",
    "there exist infinitely many points @xmath4 , such that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are postcritically finite , if and only if one of the following conditions holds :    * there exists @xmath27 such that @xmath28 is pcf and @xmath23 is the curve @xmath29 ; * there exists @xmath27 such that @xmath28 is pcf and @xmath23 is the curve @xmath30 ; * there exists a @xmath31-st root of unity @xmath32 such that @xmath23 is the zero locus of the equation @xmath33 .    in @xcite , theorem  [ main theorem ]",
    "was proven in the special case @xmath23 is the graph of a polynomial .",
    "the extension to arbitrary curves in theorem  [ main theorem ] requires overcoming several technical difficulties .",
    "we also note that theorem  [ main theorem ] can be viewed as a dynamical analogue of andr s theorem @xcite regarding plane curves containing infinitely many points with both coordinates cm points in the parameter space of elliptic curves . in the world of polynomial dynamics , the equivalent notion of a cm elliptic curve is a pcf polynomial .",
    "indeed , the parallel between the two can be viewed also at the level of arboreal galois representation associated to a polynomial which is expected to have smaller image for pcf maps , analogous to the situation for the galois representation associated to an elliptic curve , which has smaller image in the case of cm elliptic curves ; for more details , see @xcite .",
    "we observe that it is immediate to see that a curve of the form ( 1 )  to  ( 3 ) as in the conclusion of theorem  [ main theorem ] contains infinitely many points with both coordinates pcf parameters ; the difficulty in theorem  [ main theorem ] is proving that _ only _ such curves have infinitely many such points .",
    "if @xmath23 does not project dominantly onto one of the axis of @xmath34 , it is immediate to see that @xmath23 must have the form ( 1 )  or  ( 2 ) above .",
    "so , the content of theorem  [ main theorem ] is to show that when @xmath23 projects dominantly onto both axis of @xmath34 , and in addition @xmath23 contains infinitely many points with both coordinates pcf parameters , then @xmath23 must be of the form ( 3 ) as in the conclusion of our result .    theorem  [ main theorem ] can be viewed as a generalization of the problem studied in @xcite , as follows .",
    "given a plane curve @xmath23 , we have two families of polynomials parametrized by the points @xmath35 : @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the two projections of @xmath23 onto the two coordinate axis of the affine plane .",
    "then we study under what conditions there are infinitely many @xmath35 such that @xmath40 is preperiodic under both @xmath41 and @xmath42 . more generally , one could consider any two families of rational maps @xmath41 and @xmath42 parametrized by points @xmath43 on some curve @xmath23 , take any two rational maps @xmath44 , and ask under what conditions on the curve @xmath23 , on the two families @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and on the starting points @xmath47 and @xmath48 , there exist infinitely many points @xmath35 such that both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are preperiodic under the action of @xmath41 , respectively of @xmath42 .",
    "however this is a very hard question , and there are only a handful of results with restricted conditions in the literature ; see @xcite . for examples in @xcite , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are families of polynomials and @xmath51 . in @xcite , the family of rational functions , parametrized by a projective curve @xmath23 , must have exactly one degenerate point on @xmath23 and also the families @xmath45 and @xmath46 must satisfy additional technical conditions . in this article , we release all the restrictions on the curve @xmath23 , which parametrizes a family of unicritical polynomials . also , we note that the result of @xcite relied on the results from @xcite , hence the restriction to curves @xmath23 which were graphs of polynomials because then the families of maps @xmath41 and @xmath42 were parametrized by the affine line .",
    "one of the main ingredients of our article ( and also of all of the above articles ) is the arithmetic equidistribution of small points on an algebraic variety ( in the case of @xmath52 , see @xcite , in the general case of curves , see @xcite , while for arbitrary varieties , see @xcite ) .",
    "another main ingredient of this article is the geometric properties of the generalized mandelbrot sets @xmath1 ( recall that @xmath1 is the set of all @xmath17 where the orbit of @xmath40 under @xmath18 is bounded ) .",
    "more precisely , we use the combinatorial behaviour of the landing of the external rays , from which we get the precise equations for the curves @xmath23 in theorem  [ main theorem ] .",
    "using yuan s powerful theorem @xcite we show that postcritically finite maps equidistribute on the parameter space with respect to the bifurcation measure ; see theorem [ pcf equidistribution ] .",
    "assuming there exist infinitely many points @xmath53 on the plane curve @xmath23 such that both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are pcf , then the potential ( escape - rate ) functions for the bifurcation measures ( with respect to the families @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the two projections of @xmath23 on the coordinates of @xmath34 ) are proportional to each other ; see theorem [ escape relation ] .",
    "hence we get an algebraic correspondence on the @xmath56-th generalized mandelbrot set @xmath1 : for each @xmath4 , we have that @xmath57 if and only if @xmath58 .",
    "using the theory of landing external rays on the @xmath56-th generalized mandelbrot set we prove that the only algebraic correspondences on @xmath1 are linear given by an equation as in the conclusion of theorem  [ main theorem ] .",
