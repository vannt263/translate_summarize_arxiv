    "in the summer of 1975 , while i was in a soviet math camp preparing to compete in the international math olympiad on behalf of the soviet union , my fellow team members and i were approached for help by valera senderov , a math teacher in one of moscow s best special math schools .",
    "the mathematics department of moscow state university , the most prestigious mathematics school in russia , was at that time actively trying to keep jewish students ( and other `` undesirables '' ) from enrolling in the department .",
    "one of the methods they used for doing this was to give the unwanted students a different set of problems on their oral exam .",
    "i was told that these problems were carefully designed to have elementary solutions ( so that the department could avoid scandals ) that were nearly impossible to find .",
    "any student who failed to answer could easily be rejected , so this system was an effective method of controlling admissions .",
    "these kinds of math problems were informally referred to as `` jewish '' problems or `` coffins '' .",
    "`` coffins '' is the literal translation from russian ; they have also been called `` killer '' problems in english .",
    "these problems and their solutions were , of course , kept secret , but valera senderov and his friends had managed to collect a list . in 1975 , they approached us to solve these problems , so that they could train the jewish and other students in these mathematical ideas .",
    "our team of the best eight soviet students , during the month we had the problems , solved only half of them .",
    "true , that we had other priorities , but this fact speaks to the difficulty of these problems .",
    "being young and impressionable , i was shaken by this whole situation .",
    "i had had no idea that such blatant discrimination had been going on .",
    "in addition to trying to solve them at the time , i kept these problems as my most valuable possession ",
    "i still have that teal notebook .",
    "later , i emigrated to the united states .",
    "when i started my own web page , one of the first things i did was to post some of the problems .",
    "people sent me more problems , and solutions to the ones i had .",
    "it turned out that not all of the coffins even had elementary solutions : some were intentionally ambiguous questions , some were just plain hard , some had impossible premises .",
    "this article is a selection from my collection ; we picked out some choice problems that do contain interesting tricks or ideas .",
    "discrimination against jewish people at the entrance exams to the most prestigious universities in the ussr is a documented fact , see a.  shen  @xcite and a.  vershik  @xcite .",
    "alexander shen in his article published 25 problems that were given to jewish applicants .",
    "later ilan vardi wrote solutions to all those problems , see i.  vardi s homepage  @xcite .",
    "these and other articles were published later in a book , `` you failed your math test , comrade einstein : adventures and misadventures of young mathematicians , or test your skills in almost recreational mathematics . ''",
    "@xcite .    in the present collection",
    "we have only one problem that overlaps with the problems that vardi solved , and we give an easier and more surprising solution .",
    "now , after thirty years , these problems seem easier . mostly , this is because the ideas of how to solve these problems have spread and are now a part of the standard set of ideas .",
    "thirty years ago these problems were harder to solve and , in addition , the students were given these problems one after another until they failed one of them , at which point they were given a failing mark .",
    "to give readers an opportunity to try and solve these problems we separated problems , key ideas , and solutions .",

    "observe also that @xmath53    given the above preliminaries , our inequality transforms as follows : @xmath54 now , @xmath55 is always negative , so our monstrous inequality reduces , in the end , to the humble @xmath56 invoking the monotonicity of @xmath12 in @xmath0 and the fact that @xmath57 our final answer is @xmath58      inequality ( [ pr7:prob ] ) implies @xmath59 so the derivative of @xmath60 at any point @xmath4 exists and is equal to zero .",

    "the desired triangle is then @xmath39 .",
    "the angles in question are @xmath90      in figure  [ pr30i : fig ] , the sum of the areas of the two triangles @xmath91 and @xmath92 equals the area of the triangle @xmath6 . canceling the length of the side @xmath93 ,",

    "place masses at the vertices of the quadrilateral such that the center of mass of each edge falls onto a point of tangency .",
    "one way to do this is to place , at each vertex , a mass equal to 1 over the distance from that the vertex to each point of tangency of the edges that vertex is on ( the two distances must be equal ) .",
    "then the center of mass of the whole arrangement will have to be on each line connecting pairs of opposite points of tangency .",
    "therefore , these lines intersect , and all four points of tangency are in one plane , as desired .",
    "observe that @xmath95 where ( [ pr38:sol1 ] ) holds by repeated application of the sine and cosine angle sum formulae .",
    "let @xmath96 then ( [ pr38:sol2 ] ) reduces to @xmath97 all rational roots of this must be integers and divide the constant term .",
    "since @xmath98 do not work , all roots must be irrational .",
    "if we take a right triangle @xmath6 with integer sides , the area will be rational .",
    "therefore , the height onto the hypotenuse @xmath65 will be rational .",
    "this means that if we reflect this triangle about the hypotenuse , we will have four points in the plane all at rational distances from each other .    now , let the base of that height be at point @xmath94 . then , since the triangle @xmath6 is similar to the triangle @xmath99 , the distances @xmath43 and @xmath100 will both be rational . therefore ,",
    "reflecting the whole thing about the perpendicular bisector of @xmath65 yields two more points , so that all six are at rational distances from each other .",
    "all that s left now is to expand by a multiplicative factor that clears all the denominators .",
    "start with the 3 , 4 , 5 pythagorean triangle , lay the hypotenuse along the @xmath0 axis , with the center at the origin , perform the above construction , and scale by 10 to clear denominators .",
    "six such points are : @xmath101      suppose one of the vertices is at the origin .",
    "suppose the coordinates of the two other vertices are @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "if all the numbers are divisible by two , we can reduce the triangle by half .",
    "thus , we can assume that one of the numbers is not divisible by 2 .",
    "suppose @xmath104 is odd .    if @xmath105 is odd , then @xmath106 is of the form @xmath107 .",
    "as @xmath108 we must conclude that both @xmath109 and @xmath110 are odd .",
    "but the square of the length of the third side is @xmath111 , which is divisible by 4 .",
    "so the triangle ca nt be equilateral .",
    "if @xmath105 is even , then @xmath106 is of the form @xmath112 .",
    "as @xmath108 we must conclude that @xmath109 and @xmath110 have different parity .",
    "hence , @xmath113 and @xmath114 have the same parity and , correspondingly , the square of the length of the third side is again even .",
    "contradiction .",
    "for another solution , observe that the angle any segment between two grid vertices makes with either axis has to have a rational tangent .",
    "in addition , as @xmath115 the tangent of the sum ( or difference ) of two angles with rational tangents is rational .",
    "therefore any non - right angle given by grid points has rational tangent . since @xmath116 is irrational , the equilateral triangle can not have all three vertices on a square grid .",
    "consider the parallel translation of the sides @xmath43 and @xmath10 so that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are at @xmath46 , shown in figure  [ pr48sol1:fig ] .",
    "then the triangles @xmath117 and @xmath118 are equal , because they have two equal sides with an equal angle between them . therefore , @xmath60 is the median of the triangle @xmath47 .",
    "we can reconstruct a triangle from the lengths of its two sides and the median between them , which gives us the angle the original sides @xmath43 and @xmath10 made with each other .",
    "the reconstruction of that triangle is equal to the triangle @xmath119 in figure  [ pr48sol2:fig ] , where @xmath120 is the parallel translation of @xmath10 so that @xmath121 is at @xmath23 .",
    "but we are given the distance between @xmath15 and @xmath94 and between @xmath15 and @xmath122 , so we can find @xmath15 by constructing the intersection of two circles .",
    "constructing @xmath86 is easy .",
    "take the cyclic quadrilateral with the given sides and inscribe it into a circle .",
    "consider the parts of the circle between the circumference and the quadrilateral as firmly attached to the sides .",
    "consider a different quadrilateral with the given sides and the same parts attached to it shown in gray in figure  [ pr49:fig ] .",
    "the new figure will have the same perimeter as the perimeter of the circle , hence necessarily lesser area .",
    "since the attached parts have fixed area , the quadrilateral must have lesser area as well .      given a segment and a parallel line we can always divide the segment into two equal parts .",
    "take two points on the parallel line .",
    "together with the ends of the segment the points form a trapezoid .",
    "continue the sides to form a triangle .",
    "the segment passing through the third vertex of the triangle and the intersection of the diagonals of the trapezoid divides both parallel segments into two equal parts .",
    "using the division method above , divide one of the segments into eight equal parts . pick six of these parts consecutively . then perform a homothety mapping their union onto the other segment .",
    "the center of the homothety is the intersection of the other sides of the trapezoid formed by the six segments and the target segment .",
    "see figure  [ pr50:fig ] .",
    "first , compare @xmath26 and @xmath123 .",
    "the functions @xmath124 and @xmath125 are monotonic ( at least for positive @xmath0 ) , so we can use the composition of them to remove ugly pieces from our numbers :              clearly , @xmath130 .",
    "also , @xmath131 .",
    "so @xmath132 let s estimate @xmath133 .",
    "for any number slightly bigger than 1 we can use the binomial formula : @xmath134 . in our case @xmath135 .",
    "we can estimate each term after 1 as 0.75 , 0.27 , and 0.06 .",
    "we see that they are getting smaller very fast .",
    "so we know that @xmath136 , which gives us 210 digits for @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath137{a}$ ] , @xmath138{b}$ ] , and @xmath139{c}$ ] .",
    "consider three numbers : 1 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , where @xmath140 is a primitive cube root of 1 .",
    "consider the nine terms of the form @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are 0 , 1 , or 2 .",
    "if we multiply them we get an expression with all real coefficients , because it is self - conjugate .",
    "in addition , replacing @xmath12 with @xmath145 does nt change the product , so the powers of @xmath12 present in the result have to be divisible by 3 .",
    "analogously , the powers of @xmath146 have to be divisible by 3 .",
    "consequently , as the product is homogeneous , the powers of @xmath0 have to be divisible by 3 .",
    "now the denominator is of the form @xmath150{t}$ ] and has only one radical . to get rid of it",
    "we can multiply the denominator and the numerator by @xmath151{t } + \\sqrt[3]{t}^2 $ ] .",
    "the denominator becomes @xmath152 .",
    "suppose @xmath23 , @xmath86 , @xmath15 and @xmath94 denote the points on the sides of the square , in order .",

    "let point @xmath153 lie on the perpendicular given that the distance @xmath154 is the same as the length of @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath153 belongs to the same side ( or extension of the side ) of the square as @xmath94 .",
    "see figure  [ pr68:fig ] .",
    "once we know from @xmath155 how the square is oriented , the rest is easy .",
    "let @xmath23 be the point on the function that lies on the middle line between and parallel to the two lines .",
    "if we move the cut off point to the right , then the area under the function increases faster than the area over the function decreases . moving to the left is symmetric ."
