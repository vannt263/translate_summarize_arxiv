    "this limit implies that the neutrinos were still relativistic when the cmb decoupled , so they would be indistinguishable from massless neutrinos in the primary anisotropies . however , higher mass neutrinos become non - relativistic sooner , which reduces the early - time integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
