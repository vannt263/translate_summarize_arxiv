    "one of the great contributions of the _ integral_satellite has been its scans of the galactic plane and bulge , which have led to the discovery of a number of previously unknown transient x - ray binary sources @xcite .",
    "many of these sources have high columns of absorbing material along the line of sight , making the _ integral_hard x - ray response crucial for their discovery . in numerous cases a significant fraction of these columns are _ intrinsic _ to the systems in question .",

    "integral_has suggested possible interesting relationships between absorption and binary properties : a neutral column / orbital period anti - correlation ( not unexpected as short periods increases the likelihood that an x - ray source is more deeply embedded within the wind / outflow from the secondary ) , and a neutral column / x - ray pulsar spin period correlation ( which , if real , lacks an explanation ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "x - ray binaries themselves represent a wide variety of types of systems : high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) , which may be either wind fed or roche lobe overflow fed , be / x - ray binaries , and accreting msec x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , among other types of systems .",
    "outbursts can be very rapid , lasting only a few days in the case of the so - called supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxt ; @xcite , and references therein ) , or last several weeks in the cases of be / x - ray binaries and accreting msec x - ray pulsar systems .",

    "this position is 0.143 from the one we reported in @xcite , which was obtained from the ` tgdetect ` tool which fits a single , 2d gaussian to the @xmath22order image .",
    "this shift with respect to the position reported in @xcite is due to the fact that in this work we have more accurately taken into account a known artifact in the _ chandra_point spread function ( psf ) by fitting the @xmath22order image with two asymmetric two - dimensional gaussian functions .",
    "the broader gaussian function is sensitive to the expected psf anomaly , while the narrower gaussian function is fit to the core of the psf .",

    "swift_observations to detect an @xmath38s period and a pulsed fraction of 27% in the 210kev band .",
    "such a periodicity is within the realm of detectability with our _ chandra_observations , which had a nominal frame time of 1.84104s : a 1.8s exposure , followed by a 41.04ms ccd readout .",
    "actually , due to ( expected and corrected on the ground ) clock drifts , the mean frame time for our observation was 1.84121s . to search for the reported periodicity in igr  j18179@xmath01621 , we barycentered the lightcurve and then performed an epoch fold @xcite of this lightcurve using six phase bins for the trial periods .",
    "we chose six phase bins since , with the reported period , this gave folded lightcurve bin durations comparable to the frame time . when folding the lightcurve , an x - ray event is placed wholly into a single phase bin if its barycentered time ( which corresponds to the middle of the _ chandra_integration frame time ) falls anywhere within that phase bin .",
    "that is , we do not add any randomization within a frame time to an event ( which would tend to smear out a signal ) , nor do we assign fractional events across phase bins ( which would introduce artificial correlations among bins ) .",
    "although we are working near the _",

    "we see that there is a strongly detected signal at 11.82s , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",

    "if fit on their own , the _ swift_spectra prefer a softer power - law ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 for 7 degrees of freedom ) ; however , all spectral parameters from the _ swift_-only fits have 90% confidence level error bars that overlap the best - fit parameters of the joint fit .",

    "sghmxbs can be either roche lobe overflow sources ( rlo ; rare transient sources with outburst luminosities of @xmath80 ) , or wind - fed systems ( e.g. , the majority of sghmxb , with persistent luminosities of @xmath81 ) .     versus system @xmath82 ;",
