    "in the last three decades , there has been enormous progress in our understanding of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "solar models have played a particularly important role , in large part because we have powerful diagnostics of the internal solar conditions from solar neutrino experiments and helioseismology .",
    "the deficit of the observed solar neutrino fluxes relative to solar model predictions , initially reported by homestake  @xcite and then confirmed by gallex / gno  @xcite , sage  @xcite , kamiokande  @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite , sno  @xcite and borexino  @xcite , gave rise to the solar neutrino problem : major changes were required in either the theory of stellar structure and evolution and neutrino physics .",
    "the development , refinement , and testing of the standard solar model ( ssm ) played an important role in its ultimate resolution in 2002 solar neutrino flux has been obtained in 2001 ( see @xcite ) by comparing the sno charged - current result @xcite with the sk data with the method proposed by @xcite .",
    "the year 2002 is , however , recognized as the annus mirabilis @xcite for the solar neutrino physics . ] , when the sno experiment obtained direct evidence for flavor oscillations of solar neutrinos and confirmed the ssm prediction of the @xmath1 neutrino flux with a precision that , according to the latest data , is equal to about 3% .",
    "the sun is a non - radial oscillator , and powerful insights have also emerged from the study of the solar frequency pattern ( for example , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the sound speed as a function of depth can be reconstructed to high precision , of order 0.1% .",
    "abrupt changes in the solar thermal structure from ionization and the transition from radiative to convective energy transport induce acoustic glitches that can be precisely localized ; we can therefore infer the depth of the convective envelope at the 0.2% level and the surface helium abundance at the 1.5% level . as a result ,",
    "the solar structure is now well constrained and the sun can be used as a solid benchmark for stellar evolution and as a _ laboratory _ for fundamental physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it was the excellent agreement between solar models and helioseismic inferences on the solar structure ( better than 1.5@xmath9 for all constraints ) that gave a strong support to the idea that the root of the _ solar neutrino problem _ had to be found outside the realm of solar modelling @xcite , before evidence for neutrino oscillations was found .",
    "all these important measurements acquire even more relevance when considering that , in recent years , a _ solar composition problem _ has emerged .",
    "the ssm treats the absolute and relative elemental abundances as an input , and the @xcite ( hereafter gs98 ) mixture yields concordance between model and data .",
    "relative abundances of heavy elements can be precisely measured in meteorites @xcite , but the abundances of the important light cno elements can only be measured in the photosphere . the @xmath10 abundance is even less secure , as it is inferred from solar wind measurements . a systematic overhaul in solar model atmospheres , see @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter agss09 ) , has led to a downward revision in the inferred photospheric heavy element abundances ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) by up to 30 - 40% for important species such as oxygen .",
    "the magnitude of the differences is model(er ) dependent ; independent measurements by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) are intermediate between the gs98 and agss09 scales .",
    "the internal structure of ssms using the lower solar surface metallicity of agss09 does not reproduce the helioseismic constraints ; for example , the sound speed disagrees at the bottom of the convective envelope by about @xmath11 with the value inferred from helioseismology .",
    "in addition , the predicted surface helium abundance is lower by @xmath12 and the radius of the convective envelope is larger by @xmath13 with respect to the helioseismic results . in synthesis ,",
    "inferences from modern three - dimensional hydrodynamic models of the solar atmosphere lead to predictions for the solar interior that are in strong disagreement with observational constraints , well above the currently estimated errors .",
    "the solar compositon problem has been addressed by a number of independent interior calculations .",
    "problems in reconciling helioseismic data with a low abundance scale became obvious early on ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite performed a monte carlo analysis that included calculations of the rms deviations between the inferred solar sound speed profile and that predicted by models with the `` high '' and `` low '' abundances .",
    "@xcite advocated an inversion of the problem , solving for the abundances consistent with the base of the surface convection zone and surface helium abundance .",
    "the ionization signature in the surface convection zone can also be used as an independent diagnostic suggesting high metallicity ( see , however , discussion in @xcite ) ; @xcite summarized the initial results favoring a higher solar metallicity .",
    "physical processes not included in the standard model could potentially provide an explanation , but the combination of constraints has proven difficult to reproduce in practice @xcite .",
    "an intermediate solar metallicity using low - degree modes was reported by @xcite ; however , these authors note that their mixture produces a sound speed profile at variance with solar data .",
    "the goal of this work is to perform a complete and quantitative analysis of the solar composition problem .",
    "in particular , we address the following questions : which is the chemical composition of the sun that , by using the current input physics of solar models , can be inferred from helioseismic and solar neutrino data ?",
    "how does different observational information combine in determining the optimal composition of the sun ?",
    "how does the obtained composition compare to the photospheric inferred values ?",
    "do the different observational data show tensions and/or inconsistencies that may point at some inadequacies in the ssm input parameters or assumptions ? even if the problem has been already considered in literature , a thorough self - consistent discussion is still missing .",
    "while a rigorous approach is not necessary for a qualitative assessment of the problem , it becomes essential for our goal , i.e. to use the helioseismic information in combination with the solar neutrino results to infer the properties of the sun . in order to make a correct inference",
    ", one has to define an appropriate figure - of - merit ( e.g. a @xmath14 statistics ) that has to be non - biased and should combine the different pieces of the observational information with the correct relative weights .",
    "in this respect , important progress has to be done at a methodological level .",
    "this papers starts addressing this problem .",
    "we propose to use a statistical approach , normally adopted in other areas of physics ( e.g. in neutrino studies , see @xcite ) in which all the relevant pieces of information can be combined in a correct and effective way .",
    "we discuss a strategy to include the observational information for the sound speed profile , the radius of the convective envelope , the surface helium abundance , and the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 neutrino fluxes .",
    "we provide all the ingredients to describe how these quantities depend on the assumed chemical composition and to evaluate the ( correlated ) uncertainties in solar model predictions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in   [",
    "sec : modsdata ] , we review the status of ssm calculations , discuss in detail our treatment of uncertainties in theoretical predictions and also the observational constraints considered in the analysis , including sources of errors not traditionally considered such as those from inversion of helioseismic data . in   [ sec : stat ] , we describe the adopted statistical approach . in   [ sec : metals ] , we analyze the response of the sun to variations of its surface composition .

    "finally , we provide a summary and conclusions in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our theoretical working framework is the ssm and in   [ sec : ssm ] we summarize the aspects most relevant to this work .",
    "more importantly , we present our treatment of errors , for which two qualitatively different sources must be identified .",
    "on one hand , errors in the input parameters @xmath17 for solar model construction induce _ theoretical _ uncertainties in the ssm predictions @xmath18 .",
    "these errors are fully correlated , as it is discussed in   [ sec : theo ] . on the other ,",

    "it is also evident from the red dots and the red line in figure  [ sound ] that show the predictions @xmath18 of solar models implementing the best fit composition calculated by using the linear expansion  ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "these predictions deviate from the observational constraints by amounts that are larger than the uncorrelated observational errors .",

    "these values are even larger than predictions obtained by assuming gs98 surface composition . however , this result depends on the assumed heavy element grouping .",
    "the cno neutrino fluxes , in fact , are essentially determined by the carbon abundance , see table  [ logdevcomp ] , while the observational data included in our analysis are basically sensitive to the oxygen content of the sun , since this element provides a large contribution to the solar opacity .",
    "it is important to discuss how the above results changes when the neon - to - oxygen ratio is allowed to vary , since @xmath10 lacks photospheric features and the @xmath51 ratio has to be inferred indirectly from solar wind measurements . in this assumption ,",

    "however , the errors in the inferred abundances are larger than before .",
    "we note , in particular , that the neon abundance is bounded at the level of accuracy prescribed by the function  ( [ pen ] ) indicating that the observational data are not effective in constraining it .",
    "the neon - to - oxygen ratio is increased by about @xmath62 with respect to the agss09 value .",
    "the quality of the fit , however , is not significantly improved being @xmath63 and the assumption @xmath64 is allowed at @xmath55 .    the consequence of leaving neon as a free parameter is to introduce degeneracies between the various @xmath23 , as it is understood from inspection of figure  [ results3par ] and , in particular , by comparison of the left panel in figure  [ results3par ] and the lower - left panel of figure  [ results2par ] .",
    "it exists , in fact , a combination of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 that , taking also into account the effects of systematic pulls @xmath68 , leaves substantially unchanged the observational properties of the sun .",
    "an increase of neon - to - oxygen ratio can be compensated by a slight reduction of cno and/or heavy elements according to simple approximate formula : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , togheter with a re - adjustement of the systematic pulls : @xmath71 from the above relations , we see that a @xmath56 uncertainty in the neon - to - oxygen ratio roughly corresponds to @xmath72 and @xmath73 errors in the inferred cno and heavy element abundances .",
    "this degeneracy can be discussed at a more basic level by considering that the main effect produced by a change of the solar composition is the modification of the opacity profile of the sun .",
    "the source term @xmath74 that drives the modification of the solar properties and that is probed by observational data can be written as the sum of two contributions @xcite : @xmath75 the _ intrinsic _ opacity change , @xmath76 , represents the fractional variation of the opacity along the ssm profile and it is given , in our approach , by @xmath77 .",

    "we see that @xmath74 is well constrained by the available observational information .",
    "opacity should be increased by @xmath81 at the center of the sun and by @xmath82 at the bottom of the convective envelope , as it was calculated by @xcite .",
    "the moderate increase at the solar center improves the agreement with @xmath83 without affecting the solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "the increasing trend of @xmath74 is required to fit the convective radius @xmath84 and sound speed profile @xmath85 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the wavy behaviour at intermediate radii improves consistency with inferred sound speed values in the region @xmath86 .",
    "the general features of @xmath74 are essentially independent on the assumptions about the opacity uncertainty . in this respects ,",
    "the increase of the cno and/or ne content is interpreted as providing the `` tilt '' to @xmath74 , and is a solid conclusion of our analysis .",
    "figure  [ gopa2 ] , right panel , also compares the effective variations of opacity @xmath74 obtained in the two and three parameter analysis .",

    "moreover , we understand that the compositions ( [ bestfit2par ] ) and ( [ bestfit3par ] ) can not be discriminated by the adopted observational constraints .",
    "more in general , they can not be distinguished by any conceivable observational test that is dominated by the opacity profile in the radiative region of the sun : the @xmath89 difference is indeed smaller than the accuracy to which the opacity of the solar plasma is known . in summary",

    "the above results are obtained by using a simplified approach in which elements are lumped togheter in two or three groups and they essentially follow from the fact that the opacity profile of the solar radiative region is well constrained by the combination of the different observational data , as it is shown by the gray band in the right panel of in figure [ gopa2 ] . a substantial improvement with respect to the present situation",
    "could be provided by observational constraints where the degeneracy between opacities and composition is lifted .",

    "however , using different techniques for constructing the solar envelope models and the inversion procedures , and also a different equation of state , @xcite find a solar metallicity that is even lower than agss09 values .",
    "it is important to mention that @xmath104 , while independent of radiative opacities , depends crucially on the details of the equation of state . a second possibility is offered by the neutrino fluxes from the cn - cycle . while a detailed quantitative analysis will be presented elsewhere @xcite , it is important to stress at least qualitatively the importance of a cno neutrino measurement .",
    "even a low accuracy measurement , providing a direct determination of the metallicity of the solar core , permits to remove the degeneracy between opacity and composition effects .",
    "let us imagine e.g. to measure the cno flux at the 20% level .",
    "if the detected fluxes were consistent with the expectations from our analysis ( i.e. about 50% larger than the reference predictions ) , this would be sufficient to conclude that the agss09 surface abundances are wrong and/or the chemical evolution paradigm of the ssm is not correct",
