    "co - evolution of black holes and their host galaxies is a prediction of most models for the observed close correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity / velocity dispersion in local galaxies ( e.g.  kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; di matteo , springel & herquist 2005 )",
    ". studies of local agn and type-1 ( unobscured ) quasars show a correlation between agn luminosity in the mid - infrared and starburst luminosity , estimated from the far - infrared emission and/or pah features ( schweitzer et al .",
    "2006 ; shi et al .  2007 ;",
    "maiolino et al.2007 ) , and the host galaxies of quasars with strong far - infrared excesses do seem to be forming stars ( canalizo & stockton 2001 ) .",
    "however , in general , host galaxy imaging studies in the optical and near - ir do not suggest that strong star formation occurs simultaneously with quasar activity in the majority of quasars .",
    "imaging of type-1 quasar host galaxies show that the hosts of luminous quasars tend to be elliptical galaxies with little obvious signs of disturbance in _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) images ( e.g.  floyd et al .  2004 ) , and only about 30% of quasars show signs of mergers or interactions in hst or adaptive optics images ( marble et al .",

    "studies of type-2 ( obscured ) quasars have so far been consistent with this picture , and with the idea that the obscuration takes place in a nuclear torus .",
    "sturm et al .  ( 2006 ) , in their _ spitzer _ study of x - ray selected type-2 quasars , make the claim that `` type-2 quasars are not ulirgs '' based on featureless mid - infrared spectra .",
    "_ hst _ imaging studies of the host galaxies of type-2 quasars selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) show that they are consistent with being hosted by relatively undisturbed elliptical galaxies , once the likely effects of scattered light are accounted for ( zakamska et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this letter , we present results of _ spitzer _ spectroscopy and photometry , and _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath2 ) imaging of a sample of type-2 quasars , and discuss the implications for the co - evolution of galaxies and black holes .",
    "our sample is selected in the mid - infrared , which is less sensitive to reddening in the host galaxy than x - ray or optical selection , and their type-2 nature allows us to image the central regions of the host with high fidelity .",
    "the combination of infrared seds and optical imaging of this sample thus allows us for the first time to present a coherent picture of the nature of the star formation in the host galaxies of type-2 quasars .",
    "we selected all six candidate type-2 quasars with @xmath0 from the 1mjy 8@xmath3 m flux density limited sample of lacy et al .",
    "the redshift range ensures that these objects are luminous enough to be on or above the quasar / seyfert divide in the mid - infrared ( 5@xmath3 m luminosity , @xmath4 , lacy et al .",
    "2005a ) , but low enough for rest - frame @xmath5-band to be within the f814w filter of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) aboard @xmath2 .",
    "the objects were observed with the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) and infrared spectrograph ( irs ) as part of _ spitzer _ program 20083 , and with hst as program go-10848 ( table 1 ) .",
    "redshifts were obtained , and optical spectral classifications attempted ( lacy et al .",
    "low dispersion spectra were also obtained with the spex instrument ( rayner et al .",
    "2003 ) in prism mode at the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    ".observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the irs data were obtained in stare mode , using the short - low and long - low modules .",
    "the irs short - low data had a background image subtracted , made by taking a median of all the short - low observations in the astronomical observation request .",
    "the long - low data were combined by subtracting nodded pairs , then combining the pairs with minmax rejection .",
    "extraction was performed using the spice tool , with optimal extraction .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the pipeline ( post - bcd ) mips mosaics using standard aperture corrections .",
    "the acs data were taken in two filters , one longward and one shortward of the 4000@xmath6break in the rest frame of the galaxy .",
    "observations consisted of four exposures in each filter in a standard dither pattern , for one orbit per object per filter .",

    "four of our six objects were easily classified as type-2 quasars in lacy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) based on well established optical emission line diagnostics . however , sstxlfs  j171106.8 + 590436 and sstxfls  j172458.3 + 591525 had optical emission lines properties which were ambiguous . for sstxfls172458.3 + 591525 , we are able to estimate a ( [ sii]6719 + 6732)/(h@xmath7+[nii ] ) ratio of 0.4 from the irtf / spex spectrum , which , together with an [ oiii]/h@xmath8 ratio of 10 and assuming typical [ nii]6584/h@xmath7 ratios of 0.1 - 1.6 , places this object firmly amongst the agn in the diagnostic plot of kewley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , with a range in log([sii]/h@xmath7 ) @xmath9 . in the case of sstxfls  171106.8 + 590436",
    ", the h@xmath7 and [ sii ] lines are too weak to do this .",
    "however , the very high [ oiii]/h@xmath8 ratio of @xmath10 , detection of heii4686 , and a marginal detection of [ nev]14.3@xmath3 m in the irs spectrum make it very likely that an agn classification for the optical spectrum is correct .",
    "we thus assume for the rest of this paper that all six objects contain powerful agn .",
    "we fit our seds and spectra using a model based on those of sajina et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the irs spectra were fit directly , along with photometric points in @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands from the sdss , irac 3.6 and 4.5@xmath3 m data ( lacy et al .",
    "2005b ) , mips 70 and 160@xmath3 m data ( frayer et al .  2006 and",
    "this paper ) and near - infrared photometry from irtf .",
    "we also checked the irs spectrophotometry against the irac 5.8 and 8.0@xmath3 m and mips 24@xmath3 m ( fadda et al .",
    "2006 ) broad - band photometry , and found them to agree within @xmath14% .",
    "the far - infrared ( fir ) emission was fit as a modified black body with temperature @xmath15k .",
    "a warm ( small grain ) component was included with a power - law index of @xmath16 , and cutoffs at high and low frequency .",
    "the fir luminosity , @xmath17 , was estimated by summing the warm and cold components .",
    "the hot dust component was based on a power - law with variable spectral index .",
    "the long wavelength cutoff was determined by a fit of a fermi function to the least starforming agn in our sample , sstxlfs  j172123.1 + 601214 , which shows a turndown in the hot dust emission beginning at a rest - frame wavelength @xmath18 m .",
    "netzer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also suggest that the agn - related hot dust emission starts to decrease beyond @xmath18 m in type-1 quasars .",
    "the hot dust emission was exponentially cutoff at high frequencies with a variable cutoff frequency .",
    "the unreddened luminosity of the agn , @xmath19 , was estimated by integrating this component .",
    "the hot dust component is then reddened by the galactic center extinction law of chiar & tielens ( 2006 ) , likely to be a good approximation to the extreme density environments of agn ( sajina et al .",
    "2007 ) .    a modified version of the starburst polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission template of sajina et al .",
    "( 2007 ) was used to fit the pah features .",
    "agn are known to modify the pah spectra ( smith et al .",
    "in particular , for our objects , we found a better match by boosting the 7.7@xmath3 m feature in the template by hand .",
    "this pah template was fitted to the seds of all galaxies except sstxfls  j172123.1 + 601214 , which had a small amount of silicate emission added instead .",
    "total pah luminosities , @xmath20 , were determined by integrating over the fitted template . finally , a 5gyr old single stellar population from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) was fit to the optical points .",
    "the basic properties of the fits are listed in table 2 .",
    "parameters which are not well - constrained by the data ( for example the warm dust continuum strength in objects not detected at 160@xmath3 m ) are held fixed .",
    "full details of the fitting process will be given in a future paper ( ridgway et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "we first address the amount of star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "star formation rates ( sfrs ) derived from fir emission alone are suspect for quasars , as reprocessed quasar emission can , in principle , contribute to the fir flux . in the 5/6 cases where pahs are detected , however",
    ", they show typical ratios of pah / fir luminosities over a wide range of @xmath17 ( 0.02 - 0.06 in total pah integrated over our template , corresponding to 0.0014 - 0.0042 in the 6.2@xmath3 m feature , within the range for star - forming galaxies and ulirgs seen by peeters , spoon & tielens [ 2004 ] of @xmath21 ) .",
    "this indicates that the bulk of the fir emission is indeed likely to be from star formation ( see also sajina et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". a similar result has been found for type-1 quasars by schweitzer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . as figure 2 shows",
    ", however , the [ oii]3727 emission ( from the spectra of lacy et al .  [ 2007 ] , aperture corrected using the sdss photometry ) is significantly below that expected in an unreddened starburst in most cases , particularly for the objects with high fir luminosities .",
    "this is consistent with the result of ho ( 2005 ) , who found low [ oii]3727 emission from type-1 quasar hosts compared to their expected star formation rates based on measurements of molecular gas .",
    "however , the ratio of the [ neii]12.8@xmath3 m to the fir luminosity is similar for all our objects .",
    "[ neii ] is of similar ionization to [ oii ] and is also therefore dominated by emission from the starburst .",
    "this suggests that dust reddening is to blame for the lack of [ oii]3727 emission , and is also consistent with the host galaxy colors and morphologies . as can be seen in figure 1 , the host galaxies of the objects with high @xmath17 are typically disturbed , red objects , likely to be late stage merger remnants .",
    "this suggests that star formation in a significant fraction of quasar host galaxies is heavily obscured in the optical .",
    "obscuration by dusty starforming regions also seems to affect the extinction to the agn .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of axial ratio of the host galaxy ( measured using the _ ellipse _ task in iraf on the longer wavelength image ) versus the depth of the 9.7@xmath3 m silicate feature , @xmath22 , as defined by levenson et al .",
    "although our sample is small , the five of our six host galaxies with apparent or possible disk - like structures , and 1d - profiles close to exponential disks ( excluding morphological disturbances and bulge components ) , represented by the solid points , seem to show a trend in the sense that the more highly - extincted objects have more edge - on inclinations ( lower axial ratios ) . the one galaxy which does not appear disk - like , sstxfls  j172123.1 + 601214 ( open symbol ) , has an underlying @xmath23 law profile , and is probably an example of an elliptical host merging with a smaller gas - rich galaxy , and lacks the large amount of star formation seen in the mergers of two gas - rich galaxies . in this case , the obscuration is probably almost entirely due to the torus . for the disk - like hosts , a simple uniform dusty disk model appears to work for most , with a spread of about a factor of two in opacity for a line of sight perpendicular to the disk .",
    "one object ( sstxlfs  j171106.8 + 590436 ) , however , would have a high opacity in this model even if viewed face - on , corresponding to @xmath24 .",
    "this may be because the extinction is patchy , and a high inclination significantly increases the chance of the line of sight passing through a high opacity region such as a dense molecular cloud .",
    "our two most obscured type-2 quasars ( with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) have silicate absorption as deep or deeper than the most obscured agn in the sample of shi et al .",
    "these radio galaxies and seyfert 2s have @xmath27 , suggesting that extinction can be very extreme in the radio quiet quasar population .",
    "the implication of our result is that many type-2 quasars have at least a component of the extinction towards the nucleus from an extended , star forming disk on scales of kpc , in addition to , or instead of , the traditional obscuring torus , which interferometry suggests is only a few pc in size ( jaffe et al .",
    "previous suggestions that the host galaxy can contribute significantly to the agn extinction in type-2 objects have been made by martinez - sansigre et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and rigby et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , based on optical emission line properties .",
    "our results suggest that a significant fraction of the quasar population have their agn obscured by starforming regions in their host galaxies . thus studying obscured quasars",
    "is essential if we are to understand the origin of the links between the evolution of quasars and their hosts .",
