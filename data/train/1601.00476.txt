    "resonant radiation ( rr , optical cherenkov radiation , non - dispersive radiation ) arises when an optical soliton is perturbed by higher order dispersion and transfers energy to radiation in the normal dispersion region of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed for other pump pulses , for example 3-dimensional x - waves in bulk media @xcite .",
    "rr has potential practical applications as well as theoretical implications . for applications ,",
    "rr is a source of visible light for use in the field of photobiology @xcite , to produce broadband visible wavelength astrocombs @xcite , and to cancel the raman shift of the driving pulse by spectral recoil @xcite .",
    "recent research into the process of rr generation has described it as resulting from the scattering of pulse photons at the optical event horizon @xcite .",
    "this links rr to similar mode conversion processes such as the generation of the optical analogue of hawking radiation @xcite . at the same time",
    "the scattering of light also creates negative resonant radiation ( nrr ) @xcite .",
    "this involves a coupling between positive and negative frequencies and therefore is a novel amplification process in optics @xcite .",
    "progress has been made to meet the requirements for a practical rr based light source .",
    "typical applications of rr require narrow - band tunable light with powers in the mw range and high stability .",
    "tunability is achieved either by using tapered fibers @xcite , by varying the input pulse polarization @xcite or by tuning the pump wavelength @xcite .",
    "the rr bandwidth is reduced by tuning the input pulse wavelength away from the fiber zero dispersion wavelength @xcite . the pulse to pulse energy stability",
    "is improved by using an all fiber set up @xcite or tapered fibers @xcite . in order to reach mw power levels ,",
    "a high conversion efficiency between the pump pulse and the rr is required .",
    "various groups have studied the efficiency dependence on : pump wavelength separation from the fiber zdw , pump pulse length , pump power , fiber core size and fiber third order dispersion @xcite .",
    "the generation of the rr depends strongly on the overlap of the driving pulse spectrum with the phase matched rr wavelength .",
    "therefore the strongest rr signal will be produced when the input pulse compresses most efficiently and its spectrum expands to the greatest extent .",
    "a crucial parameter here is the input pulse frequency chirp .",
    "this can be used to delay the nonlinear pulse evolution by introducing a linear chirp which must first be compensated .",
    "this effect has been studied in relation to supercontinuum generation @xcite and in particular spectral broadening @xcite . in the latter two papers",
    "numerical and experimental results show this delayed pulse compression and demonstrate that the greatest spectral broadening in the output of a fiber can be expected when the input pulse chirp is positive and equal to the magnitude of the negative dispersion over the whole fiber length . delayed compression due to chirp is therefore an established idea but one might expect the chirp to be eventually compensated and thus to have no impact on the degree of pulse compression .",
    "however , in this paper we show that the chirp can be used to increase the degree of compression and to control the emisson of resonant radiation . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we presented the first detailed investigation of the effect of pulse chirp beyond the delayed nonlinear compression . in that paper",
    "we showed numerically and experimentally that , for shorter pulses and fibers than had been considered previously , interesting effects arise such as an increased degree of pulse compression for a small positive chirp compared to zero chirp .",
    "we therefore expect to be able to observe an increased rr generation efficiency for this optimum chirp . in this paper we present experimental results testing this behaviour by measuring the output rr from a fiber as a function of the input chirp .",
    "additionally , we apply the recent technique described in @xcite , varying the chirp to change the distance propagated by the rr between its generation and the fiber end . in this way we can qualitatively investigate its evolution without the need to cut the fiber .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the phase matching condition for rr and how we can use this with the fiber dispersion relations to predict the rr wavelength . in the following section the propagation of chirped pulses is considered , in particular the effect of pulse compression .",
    "simulation results are then presented showing how the chirp affects pulse compression .",
    "we find that chirp can be used to move the position of pulse compression and that contrary to a naive understanding the chirp can also be used to vary the compression ratio . finally experimental results are presented to demonstrate how this variation in the compression ratio affects the generation of rr .",
    "light propagation in the fiber is governed by the generalised nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gnlse ) @xcite . when higher order and absorption terms are neglected the gnlse",
    "can be simplified to the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) of which the family of fundamental and higher order solitons are solutions .",
    "these are characterised by a soliton order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the soliton peak power and length ( @xmath3 is the fwhm length ) , @xmath4 is the non - linearity and @xmath5 the second order dispersion parameter of the fiber @xcite .",
    "the fundamental soliton is characterised by @xmath6 and the higher order solitons by larger integers . with small higher order dispersion terms ( third order and up )",
    "included the soliton is perturbed and will lose energy to dispersive rr and nrr in the normal group velocity dispersion region .",
    "higher order solitons become unstable and fission into @xmath7 pulses occurs , each of which will lose energy to rr and nrr @xcite . in order for a rr signal to build up in the fiber",
    "the rr waves generated at different times must interfere constructively .",
    "this occurs when the following momentum conserving phase matching condition is satisfied @xcite :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the rr and pulse angular frequencies , respectively .",
    "we express ( [ eq : pm0 ] ) as a conservation of frequency in the frame comoving with the pulse @xcite :    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the doppler shifted frequency in the comoving frame of the pulse of velocity @xmath13 . the mode propagation constant is related to the fiber refractive index by @xmath14 .     as a function of wavelength for a pulse at @xmath15 nm . markers",
    "indicate the pulse wavelength ( ) , the rr in the visible ( ) , and the nrr in the uv ( ) .[fig:1 ] ]    formulation ( [ eq : pm ] ) of the phase matching condition makes it simple to find solutions using graphical methods .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows @xmath16 around @xmath17 as a function of the lab frame wavelength for fiber 1 ( nl-1.5 - 590 by nkt photonics ) used in our experiment .",
    "we assume a pulse at 800@xmath18 and negligible nonlinear contributions from the input pulse .",
    "hence , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the rr as a solution to the phasematching condition in the visible .",
    "the nrr solution can also be seen at ` negative wavelengths ' .",
    "the evolution of a pulse in a fiber will be influenced mainly by self - phase modulation ( spm ) and group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) .",
    "the former affects the pulse spectrum and the latter changes the relative velocity of the pulse frequencies .",
    "the interplay of these two effects allows stable solitons to form in the absence of additional higher order effects .",
    "the relative strength of spm and gvd determines the formation of a fundamental or a higher order soliton .",
    "higher order solitons initially compress in time and broaden spectrally due to gvd and spm .",
    "when a pulse generates rr , the generation is driven by the amplitude of the pulse at the rr frequency ; hence the greater the degree of spectral broadening the more rr will be generated .",
    "an initially chirped pulse has the same spectrum as an unchirped pulse , but the instantaneous frequency will vary across the pulse , broadening the pulse temporally .",
    "an anomalous fiber dispersion will compensate an initial positive chirp and thus the pulse will compress towards its unchirped length . the interplay of spm and gvd will then compress the pulse further as for unchirped input pulses until a minimum pulse length is reached at the ` compression point ' .",
    "therefore , a variable initial chirp can be used to compress the pulse at a controlled fiber length .",
    "hence , the strongest rr production is expected at the compression point with the amount critically dependent on the compression ratio .    as we will see in the simulations and experiments",
    ", the compression ratio will be greater for a small positive chirp compared to zero chirp and then reduce as the chirp becomes larger .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of pulse propagation under the gnlse .",
    "we use a standard split - step fourier tool @xcite , which takes into account the full dispersion profile as well as nonlinear and raman effects .",
    "we use dispersion profiles determined from rr measurements for the two fibers used in the experiments @xcite .",
    "fiber 1 ( nl-1.5 - 590 , nkt photonics , ltd . ) has a zero - dispersion wavelength ( zdw ) of 685@xmath19 nm and fiber 2 ( nl-1.6 - 615 , nkt photonics , ltd . )",
    "a zdw of 697@xmath19 nm .",
    "both fibers have anomalous dispersion at longer wavelengths .",
    "propagations of hyperbolic secant pulses with varying linear chirp are simulated .",
    "the main factors for the generation of rr are the evolution of the pulse spectrum and the pulse peak power , stimulating and driving rr production , respectively .",
    "the simulation parameters are matched to the experimental parameters .",
    "we used a @xmath20 hyperbolic secant pulse with a power corresponding to a soliton order of @xmath21 and a center wavelength of @xmath22 in the anomalous dispersion region .",
    "we also extended the investigation to different soliton orders and pulse lengths .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     fs input pulse .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ]    detailed results of the fiber 1 simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly review the results and conclusions relevant to rr generation .",
    "two example spectral evolutions for this fiber are shown in figure [ fig:2 ] for an unchirped ( a ) and a chirped pulse ( b ) . for zero input chirp",
    "the input pulse spectrum expands to almost three octaves within the first @xmath23 of fiber and then contracts again rapidly .",
    "rr is generated when the spectrum expands and reaches the rr wavelength between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "similar results are found for fiber 2 .",
    "for the large input chirp in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( b ) the behavior is similar , however , the point of temporal compression and spectral expansion is considerably further along the fiber .",
    "in addition the extent of the spectral broadening has slightly decreased .",
    "as the pulse compresses and broadens , its peak power will rise to a maximum and then decrease . as we see , the rr is alomst entirely generated where the pulse compresses , i.e. spectrally broadens , and assumes the maximum peak power .",
    "hence it is instructive to find out how efficient the pulse compression is as the pulse chirp is varied .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the maximum , compressed peak power as a function of the input pulse chirp .",
    "the peak power assumes a maximum for small positive chirps exceeding the power for zero chirp . for larger positive chirps the maximum peak power decreases , indicating that the pulse is not compressing as much .    for both fibers we carried out the same simulations for @xmath26 values up to @xmath27 and a pulse lengths from @xmath20 to @xmath28 .",
    "in all cases we found an optimum chirp for pulse compression . in fig.[fig:4 ] the variation in the value of this optimum chirp with soliton order and pulse length can be seen . in fig.[fig:4](a ) and in fig.[fig:4](b ) a @xmath20 pulse length is used in each case and in fig.[fig:4](c ) and fig.[fig:4](d ) @xmath29 is used for each pulse length .",
    "the figure shows that a positive initial chirp leads to optimal pulse compression .",
    "the obtained compressed peak powers increase between 10 and 75 percent .",
    "the chirp plays an important role for a fundamental soliton , although the pulse compression is small . for higher energies",
    "the pulse peak power increses less , but due to the strong compression rr is generated .",
    "the rr amplitude and efficiency critically depend on the pulse peak power and so we expect a systematic and strong dependence of rr on pulse chirp .",
    "the peak power enhancement applies to a large range of pulse lengths .     ]",
    "we also carried out simulations without self - steepening and raman scattering .",
    "whilst they had an impact on the position of compression in the fiber they did not significantly affect the optimum prechirp .",
    "the simulations demonstrate how the input pulse chirp can be used to optimise pulse compression . in the experiments we investigate the impact of this on the generation efficiency of rr .",
    "we can additionally use the chirp varying technique described in @xcite to qualitatively investigate the evolution of rr .    in the experiments we use short pulses centered at 800@xmath19 nm with a bandwidth of over 200@xmath19 nm from a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( rainbow , femtosource gmbh ) .",
    "these are coupled into the two photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) .",
    "the pcfs are typically around l=5@xmath19 mm in length as the pulses evolve over yet shorter distances .",
    "the input pulse lies in the anomalous dispersion region of the pcfs which , in the absence of higher order effects , allows for soliton formation .",
    "the pcf output in the visible and ir is measured using a ccd spectrometer ( avaspec , avantes bv ) .",
    "the variation in input pulse length and chirp is achieved by inserting glass elements in the beam path .",
    "negative dispersion can be added by increasing the number of reflections from a pair of double chirped mirrors ( dcms ) .",
    "the minimum pulse length ( fwhm ) used is @xmath30 for the unchirped pulse .",
    "additional data is taken with a @xmath31 pulse .",
    "the typical average input power was @xmath32 .",
    "the coupling into the pcfs is around @xmath33 but varies between fiber samples .",
    "the pulse chirp @xmath34 leads to an increase in the pulse length and a variation in the instantaneous frequency across the pulse .",
    "it is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the gvd and path distances through each dispersive element @xmath38 before the fiber and @xmath39 is the negative group delay dispersion ( gdd ) of the dcms .    the contour plots in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] show how the pulse and rr spectra vary as the input chirp is changed for the two fibers used in the experiments .",
    "rr peaks are measured at about @xmath40 ( fiber 1 ) and @xmath41 ( fiber 2 ) .",
    "the plots are qualitatively similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] showing spectral evolution as a function of propagation distance .",
    "however , in this case an increasing pulse chirp corresponds to compression further along the fiber and hence a decreasing propagation distance for the rr generated at the compression point . for large",
    "pulse chirps the gvd is unable to compensate the chirp and the pulse does not compress fully in the fiber . hence the output spectrum is narrow and the rr negligible .",
    "as the chirp decreases the pulse is able to fully compress at the end of the fiber and we observe the spectral broadening of the pulse and the initial generation of the rr in the fiber output",
    ". further decrease of the chirp moves the compression point towards the input end of the fiber .",
    "the spectral broadening reduces as the pulse has temporally expanded again by the time it reaches the output .",
    "the distance propagated by the rr increases and as in the simulation plots we see it forming an isolated peak at a fixed wavelength .",

    "we expect the rr to be generated only during pulse compression and to propagate after this with little change in energy .",
    "therefore , the total amount of rr generated should not depend on where the pulse compresses .",
    "however , in the simulations the compressed peak power slightly varied along the fiber and therefore the generation efficiency of the rr varied , too .",
    "we expect a maximum in the rr output for the optimum chirp followed by a decline as the chirp increases further until the rr becomes negligible when the chirp is too large to be compensated inside the fiber .    the graphs in fig .",

    "note that the optimum chirp is lower than expected from fig .",

    ". the difference may be due to inaccuracies in the dispersion profile of fiber 2 for ir wavelengths , which weigh much stronger if the group velocity dispersion is lower due to the larger zdw .",

    "if the compression occurs at the end of the fiber , the pulse spectrum will have expanded to overlap with the rr hence increasing the signal at that wavelength and producing the second maximum .",
    "the differences in the fiber dispersion and the pulse parameters in each case may explain why the peak is less pronounced for fiber 2 .",
    "the second peak , therefore , includes light from the pulse .",

    "such considerations are of particular importance when high conversion efficiencies are required for practical applications .",
    "even a small improvement in the pulse compression can lead to a large increase of the rr .",
