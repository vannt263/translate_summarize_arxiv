    "this is the second of two companions papers on similarity solutions for the interior structure of spherically symmetric charged black holes . in a seminal paper , poisson & israel ( 1990 )",
    "@xcite showed that if ingoing and outgoing fluids are allowed to pass through each other inside a charged black hole , then the generic consequence is ` mass inflation ' as the counter - streaming fluids approach the inner horizon . during mass inflation , the interior mass , the misner - sharp mass @xcite , a gauge - invariant scalar quantity , exponentiates to an enormous value . the phenomenon of mass inflation has been confirmed analytically and numerically in many papers @xcite .",
    "in the first paper of this pair , hereafter paper  1 @xcite , the black hole was allowed to accrete a relativistic fluid of charged baryons .",
    "the baryons did not undergo mass inflation , precisely because , by construction , the single component baryonic fluid considered there was either ingoing or outgoing , not both .",
    "in the present paper we allow the black hole to accrete , in addition to a charged baryonic fluid , a pressureless neutral ` dark matter ' fluid , which one can imagine as being cold dark matter , or hot dark matter ( neutrinos ) , or even high frequency gravitational waves .",
    "the dark matter particles may be either massive or massless ; it does not change the character of the solutions .",
    "the important thing is that the dark matter passes freely through the baryons , for the most part interacting with the baryons only by gravity , although we do consider what happens if the dark matter has a finite cross - section for absorption by the baryons .",
    "as expected , relativistic counter - streaming between baryons and dark matter leads to mass inflation near the inner horizon .",
    "analytic and numerical work on spherically symmetric collapse and mass inflation has commonly modeled the fluid accreted by a black hole as a massless scalar field , usually uncharged @xcite , but also charged @xcite .",
    "a key property of a massless scalar field is that it allows waves to counter - stream relativistically through each other , which allows mass inflation to occur .    in the present paper",
    "we choose to adopt a somewhat different approach .",
    "a driving motivation for this paper and its companion , paper  1 , was to enquire what happens inside an astronomically realistic black hole , and it has seemed to us that a mix of baryons and dark matter might offer a more realistic description than a massless scalar field . besides this , we wanted the freedom to explore what happens if the parameters of the model are changed : the electrical conductivity of the baryons ( considered in paper  1 ) , massive versus massless dark matter , the ratio of accreted dark matter to baryonic density , or the interaction cross - section between dark matter and baryons .",
    "as in paper  1 , our goal is not so much to study the formation of a black hole by gravitational collapse , but rather to explore the interior structure of black holes after their formation .",
    "we have in mind the situation of a realistic astronomical black hole , perhaps stellar - sized , perhaps supermassive , which is being fed by accretion of matter .    in a supermassive black hole",
    "especially , the mass that the black hole acquires by gradual accretion over the course of millions or billions of years can greatly exceed the mass of the seed black hole , formed perhaps from the collapse of the core of a massive star .",
    "under such circumstances it is reasonable to expect that the bulk of the interior structure of the black hole is determined by the accretion history , rather than by the details of the initial collapse event .",
    "the situation considered in the present paper is in a sense the opposite to that considered by poisson & israel ( 1990 ) @xcite and others @xcite , who supposed that ingoing radiation or scalar field falling into a pre - existing charged black hole would encounter a price tail @xcite of outgoing radiation generated during gravitational collapse . because the black holes considered in the present paper are assumed to accrete self - similarly into the indefinite future",
    ", the theorems recently proven by dafermos ( 2003 ) @xcite concerning the collapse of isolated self - gravitating systems and the decay of price tails do not apply . in the present paper ,",
    "accreted charged baryons are repelled by the charge of the black hole self - consistently produced by previously accreted baryons , and naturally become outgoing . any outgoing price tail of radiation generated by gravitational collapse would soon be overwhelmed by the accreted charged baryons .",
    "for example , a black hole destined to become a quasar might radiate a fraction of a solar mass in a price tail at the time it forms from the core collapse of a massive star , but may subsequently accrete @xmath0 solar masses or more of baryons .",
    "since the bulk of the fluid inside the black hole is naturally outgoing , to produce mass inflation the black hole must be allowed to accrete a ( small amount of ) fluid which remains ingoing , and which streams more or less freely through the outgoing baryons .",
    "dark matter fits the description nicely .",
    "many previous papers have found that the collapse of a massless scalar field into a charged black hole produces not only a strong spacelike singularity at zero radius but also a weak null singularity at finite radius along the cauchy horizon @xcite , as already anticipated by poisson & israel ( 1990 ) @xcite .",
    "a null singularity does not form in the similarity solutions .",
    "why this should be is discussed in  [ nonull ] .",
    "an important question considered in the present paper is what happens if dark matter and baryons have a finite cross - section for interaction at high energy . for mass inflation to persist , and in particular for a null singularity to form on the cauchy horizon , it is necessary that counter - streaming ingoing and outgoing fluids accelerate to arbitrarily close to the speed of light ( or become arbitrarily highly blueshifted , for massless streams ) relative to each other .",
    "this raises the question of whether it is physically realistic to allow counter - streaming at arbitrarily large lorentz factors . to address this question ,",
    "we explore the consequences of allowing the dark matter to have a non - zero cross - section for absorption by baryons at high collision energy .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ equations ] , which is a follow - on to  ii of paper  1 , presents the general relativistic equations governing the interior and exterior structure of a spherically symmetric black hole that accretes dark matter in addition to charged baryons .",
    "section  [ similaritysolutions ] brings in the hypothesis of self - similarity , and sets out the equations that follow from that hypothesis , generalizing  iii of paper  1 .",
    "section  [ resultsbaryonsdm ] gives results for self - similar black holes accreting baryons and dark matter .",
    "section  [ inflation ] discusses the physical question of why mass inflation occurs .",
    "section  [ appearance ] addresses the question of what it would actually look like if you fell into one of the black holes described herein .",
    "finally , section  [ summary ] summarizes the findings of this paper .",
    "this section presents the general relativistic equations governing a spherically symmetric black hole accreting almost non - interacting dark matter in addition to charged , electrically conducting baryons .",
    "the required formalism has already been developed for the most part in  ii of paper  1 @xcite , to which the reader is referred for notation and further detail .",
    "it proves convenient to work in the rest frame of the baryons , with the dark matter streaming at 4-velocity @xmath1 relative to the tetrad frame of the baryons . to be consistent with",
    "spherical symmetry , the dark matter must stream radially , so the non - vanishing components of the dark matter 4-velocity @xmath1 are the time and radial components @xmath2 without loss of generality , the rest mass @xmath3 of the dark matter particle can be taken to be either @xmath4 or @xmath5 , depending on whether the particle is massless or massive .",
    "thus @xmath6 below we will generally present arguments as if the dark matter particle were massive . the case of a massless particle follows from letting the massive particle approach the speed of light and simultaneously letting its rest mass go to zero .",
    "appropriate factors of rest mass @xmath3 are included in the formulae below .",
    "adapted to the dark matter frame is an associated tetrad frame , with inertial axes @xmath7 , corresponding vierbein coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , equation  ( 6 ) of paper  1 , and corresponding time coordinate @xmath11 . the dark matter time",
    "coordinate @xmath11 differs from the baryonic time coordinate @xmath12 because the gauge of time is being chosen , equation  ( 5 ) of paper  1 , so that the proper radial derivative of time is zero ; that is , the dark matter time coordinate @xmath11 is arranged to satisfy @xmath13 , whereas the baryonic time coordinate @xmath12 satisfies @xmath14 .",
    "the locally inertial axes @xmath7 in the rest frame of the dark matter are related to the locally inertial axes @xmath15 in the baryonic frame by a lorentz boost at 4-velocity @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that the directed derivatives in the dark matter frame , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are equal to the directed derivatives in the baryonic frame lorentz boosted by 4-velocity @xmath1 : @xmath18 or more explicitly @xmath19    applying equations  ( [ dd ] ) to the radial coordinate @xmath20 shows that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are equal to @xmath21 and @xmath22 lorentz boosted by 4-velocity @xmath1 @xmath23 equations  ( [ bgud ] ) reflect the fact that @xmath24 form the time and radial components of a covariant 4-vector , the radial 4-gradient , as already remarked in equation  ( 12 ) of paper  1 .",
    "the magnitude squared of the covariant 4-vector @xmath25 is @xmath26 which is null for massless dark matter , @xmath27 , or the same as the magnitude squared of @xmath28 for massive dark matter , @xmath29 .    similarly , applying equations  ( [ dd ] ) to the time coordinate @xmath11 yields the result that @xmath30    for self - similar solutions , equations  ( [ dtd ] ) translate into a second explicit relation [ the first being equations  ( [ bgud ] ) ] between the dark matter and baryon vierbein coefficients . the second relation , equation  ( [ xid ] ) below , is most transparently derived not directly from equations  ( [ dtd ] ) , but rather from the transformation of the homothetic 4-vector introduced in ",
    "iiib of paper  1 @xcite .",

    "the tetrad formalism for spherically symmetric geometry was set up and the einstein and weyl tensors derived , and in  iib of paper  1 , the resulting einstein equations were written down for the case where the tetrad frame was taken to be the center of mass frame , defined to the frame where the momentum density vanishes . in the present subsection",
    "the einstein equations are given for a radially moving tetrad frame , such as the baryonic frame , which is not necessarily the center of mass frame .",
    "the einstein equations  ( [ einsteineqsd ] ) in the moving frame are not as physically transparent as those , equations  ( 34 ) of paper  1 , in the center of mass frame .",
    "the most general form of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath35 consistent with spherical symmetry is @xmath36 substituting the einstein tensor , equation  ( 26 ) of paper  1 , into einstein s equations @xmath37 implies that the quantities @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 defined by equations  ( 25 ) of paper  1 are @xmath42 the einstein equations thus become    [ einsteineqsd ] @xmath43    equation  ( [ bernoullid ] ) implies that the quantity @xmath44 , defined by equation  ( 22 ) of paper  1 , satisfies @xmath45 the result of taking @xmath21 times equation  ( [ accelerationd ] ) minus @xmath22 times equation  ( [ bernoullid ] ) is the first law of thermodynamics for the combined baryonic and dark matter fluid @xmath46 einstein s equations automatically incorporate conservation of energy - momentum , as expressed by the vanishing of the covariant derivative of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath47 .",
    "the time ( @xmath48 ) component of the energy - momentum conservation equation gives the energy conservation equation @xmath49 while the spatial components ( @xmath50 ) of the energy - momentum conservation equation give a momentum conservation equation which reduces precisely to the euler equation  ( [ eulerd ] ) .",

    ", we assume that dark matter particles that interact with the baryons are simply absorbed into the baryonic fluid , adding their energy and momentum into the baryons , which retain their isotropic pressure and relativistic equation of state . if the rate , the mass per unit volume per unit time , at which dark matter is absorbed into the baryonic fluid is denoted @xmath54 , in the frame of reference of the dark matter , then the equations of energy - momentum conservation for the dark matter are @xmath55 for the energy - momentum tensor of equation  ( [ td ] ) , the energy - momentum conservation equations  ( [ dtd ] ) are equivalent to two equations , first , the equation describing unaccelerated free - fall of the dark matter , @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and second , the equation for conservation of dark matter rest mass @xmath58 the free - fall equation  ( [ dud ] ) gives @xmath59 while equation  ( [ drhod ] ) for conservation of dark matter rest mass is @xmath60      the baryons ( subscripted @xmath61 ) and the electric field ( subscripted @xmath62 ) are coupled . as remarked in  [ frames ] , it is simplest to work in the rest frame of the baryons , where the momentum density of baryons is zero @xmath63 .",

    "together , the coupled baryons and electric field satisfy the energy - momentum conservation equation @xmath71 the right hand side of which represents the energy - momentum dumped into the baryonic fluid as the result of dark matter being absorbed by baryons . the time ( @xmath48 ) and space ( @xmath50 ) components of equation  ( [ dtbe ] ) yield the energy and momentum conservation equations for the baryons coupled to the electric field @xmath72      we assume that the rate @xmath54 at which dark matter is absorbed into baryons is proportional to the density @xmath73 of dark matter particles , multiplied by an absorption rate per particle @xmath74 @xmath75 in general the rate @xmath74 will be an integral over collision energy ( in the dark matter frame ) of the number density of baryons times the absorption cross - section times the collision velocity .",
    "we treat the absorption rate @xmath74 as a phenomenological quantity , the aim being to explore what happens as the properties of the absorption rate are varied .",
    "if the absorption rate @xmath74 is assumed to be some function of the baryonic density @xmath65 and of the 4-velocity @xmath1 between the dark matter and the baryons , then self - similarity requires that the absorption rate be proportional to the square root of the baryonic density , similarly to the electrical conductivity , equation  ( 48 ) of paper  1 , and otherwise to be some arbitrary function of the 4-velocity .",

    "the previous subsection ,  [ nodrop ] , showed that for ingoing and outgoing fluids to approach an inner horizon , they must stream ever faster through each other .",
    "but what drives such counter - streaming ?",
    "the thing that drives ingoing and outgoing fluids to stream ever faster through each other is the inward gravitational force .",
    "the trick is that ` inward ' , meaning in the direction of smaller radius @xmath20 , means opposite directions for the ingoing and outgoing fluids .",
    "ingoing and outgoing fluids are both accelerated inwards , but nevertheless they are accelerated in opposite directions .    in  ivb of paper 1 we attached a gyroscope to an infalling observer , and , having initialized the gyroscope so that it points towards the black hole , we defined the direction in which the gyroscope points as the immutable direction towards the black hole . in the locally inertial ( tetrad ) frame of the infalling observer , the direction towards the black hole",
    "is not necessarily the direction of smaller circumferential radius @xmath20 .",
    "rather , the direction of smaller circumferential radius @xmath20 is determined by the sign of the vierbein coefficient @xmath200 , equation  ( 12 ) of paper  1 .",

    "conversely , a negative @xmath22 means that the gyroscope points in the direction of larger proper circumferential radii .",
    "zero @xmath22 means that the circumferential radius is an extremum .",
    "the reader who is not yet convinced that accelerating inwards , i.e.  making the radial coordinate velocity @xmath201 more negative , can mean accelerating in two opposite directions is invited to consider what happens to the radial 4-gradient @xmath202 under accelerations , i.e.  under lorentz boosts , equation  ( [ bgud ] ) , in the case at hand , where the radial 4-gradient is timelike , @xmath203 , and @xmath21 is negative .",

    "what drives mass inflation is a feedback loop in which the increasing radial pressure of the counter - streaming fluids amplifies the gravitational force , which accelerates the counter - streaming , which in turn increases the radial pressure . to see how this works , consider the gravitational force equation  ( [ accelerationd ] ) which governs the acceleration @xmath204 of the coordinate radial velocity @xmath201 .",
    "equation  ( [ accelerationd ] ) is nominally for the baryonic tetrad frame , but essentially the same equation remains valid in the dark matter tetrad frame , if all quantities in the equation are reinterpreted as relative to the dark matter frame .",

    "it is this general relativistic force @xmath206 , which increases as the square of the streaming radial 4-velocity @xmath127 , that drives mass inflation .",
    "by contrast , the newtonian contribution @xmath205 , to the gravitational force increases only linearly with the streaming radial 4-velocity @xmath127 . in the baryons the inward gravitational force",
    "is partially opposed by the @xmath208 force from a strong pressure gradient generated as a back reaction to the gravitational force , but still the primary gravitational force wins .",
    "the dark matter is pressureless , so in that case the @xmath208 force is zero .",
    "it is curious that the gravitational force term @xmath206 is the key player in two seemingly opposite roles .",
    "on the one hand , in a vacuum charged black hole this gravitational force term is repulsive , thanks to the negative radial pressure of the electric field .",
    "it is this gravitational repulsion that causes a vacuum black hole to contain an inner horizon , where ingoing and outgoing frames accelerate to the speed of light relative to each other . without the gravitational repulsion , ingoing and outgoing fluids",
    "would not be inclined to accelerate through each other to the speed of light , and mass inflation would not begin . on the other hand , it is this same gravitational force term , with an exponentially growing positive pressure rather than a passive negative pressure , that provides the feedback loop that drives mass inflation .",
    "the electric force behaves differently from the gravitational force .",
    "irrespective of the sign of @xmath22 , electrically charged particles can consistently interpret the electric force as being caused either by a positive charge @xmath70 located in the direction of the black hole , or by a negative charge @xmath209 located in the direction away from the black hole .",
    "either way , a positively charged particle is always repelled in the direction away from the positively charged black hole .      in  [ dmsec ] it was found that reducing one of the ingoing dark matter or outgoing baryonic streams to a trace amount relative to the other stream actually resulted in more extreme mass inflation , in the sense that the inflationary scale length @xmath164 , equation  ( [ l ] ) , became shorter , and the mass @xmath126 exponentiated to a larger value , before mass inflation came to an end .",
    "an analogous result was found in  [ wmsec ] , where for example increasing the absorption rate of dark matter by baryons so that the ingoing dark matter stream was reduced to a trace again led to more extreme mass inflation .",
    "since the simultaneous presence of both ingoing and outgoing streams is a prerequisite for mass inflation to occur , one might have thought that comparable amounts of ingoing and outgoing fluid would produce more inflation .",
    "but the opposite is true : less of one stream relative to the other produces more inflation , with comparable amounts of ingoing and outgoing fluid producing the least inflation .",
    "for definiteness , consider the ( more realistic ) case where the dark matter density is only a small fraction of the baryonic density ( an analogous argument applies in the opposite case where the baryonic density is only a small fraction of the dark matter density ) .",
    "mass inflation begins at around the time that the general relativistic gravitational force @xmath206 becomes dominant in the acceleration equation  ( [ accelerationd ] ) , which happens when the radial streaming 4-velocity @xmath127 has become large enough in absolute value .",
    "the smaller the dark matter density , the larger the 4-velocity @xmath127 must become in order for @xmath206 to take over as the dominant gravitational force .",
    "a larger 4-velocity @xmath127 requires that the ingoing and outgoing fluids approach closer to the inner horizon before mass inflation begins .",
    "as the fluids approach the inner horizon , the characteristic scale length @xmath164 over which the 4-velocity @xmath127 increases becomes shorter and shorter .",
    "when in due course mass inflation sets in , it is this characteristic scale length that determines the scale length over which @xmath126 and @xmath127 then exponentiate together . a smaller dark matter density thus implies a smaller inflationary length scale @xmath164 , hence more extreme inflation .",
    "in  [ dmsec ] it was found that mass inflation eventually ceased , whereafter the ingoing and outgoing fluids plunged to a spacelike singularity at zero radius .",
    "why does mass inflation end ?",
    "what happens is that the streaming 4-velocity @xmath127 ceases its exponential growth , and indeed starts shrinking instead of growing .",
    "the dominant term in the differential equation  ( [ dlnu ] ) governing the evolution of the 4-velocity @xmath127 is the term proportional to @xmath135 , which can be interpreted as the direct gravitational force term .",
    "the other term , proportional to the acceleration @xmath92 generated as a result of pressure balance , slightly counteracts the direct @xmath135 term , but not much . now @xmath135 is the momentum density in the no - going @xmath136 frame of reference , at the border between ingoing frames ( positive @xmath113 ) and outgoing frames ( negative @xmath113 ) .",
    "the momentum density @xmath135 , equation  ( [ txi ] ) , is a sum of two opposing terms , one from the outgoing baryons , the other from the ingoing dark matter . at the outset of inflation",
    ", the contribution to @xmath135 from the baryons exceeds that from the dark matter .",
    "as mass inflation continues , the relative contribution from dark matter gradually becomes more important .",
    "this is because as time goes by , the dark matter streaming through the baryons is accreted later and later in the evolution of the black hole , and in the similarity solutions the mass of accreted dark matter increases linearly with time .",
    "eventually , the contribution to @xmath135 from the ingoing dark matter exceeds that from the outgoing baryons , and @xmath135 switches sign .",
    "equivalently , the center - of - mass frame , where @xmath210 , switches from outgoing to ingoing . at this point , or actually just before this point thanks to the @xmath92 term , the streaming 4-velocity @xmath127 starts shrinking instead of growing , and mass inflation has come to an end .",
    "we must admit that we find it physically somewhat mysterious that the gravitational force can operate in different directions on the ingoing and outgoing fluids , as argued in ",
    "[ drive ] , and yet the proper streaming 4-velocity @xmath127 can nevertheless shrink .",
    "we can only assume that this mystery can be attributed to the difference between coordinate velocities and proper velocities .",
    "whatever the case , the mathematics governing @xmath127 , equation  ( [ dlnu ] ) , is clear enough .",
    "the behavior of the homothetic scalar @xmath34 during inflation is closely related to that of the streaming 4-velocity @xmath127 .",
    "the equation  ( [ dlnh ] ) governing the evolution of @xmath34 contains , like equation  ( [ dlnu ] ) governing @xmath127 , two terms : a term proportional to the momentum density @xmath135 in the no - going frame , and another term [ the one proportional to @xmath211 which during inflation is subdominant and acts in mild opposition to the principal @xmath135 term . as with @xmath127 , the end of inflation",
    "is signaled by @xmath135 changing sign , and accordingly @xmath34 , which decreased exponentially in absolute value during inflation , starts rising back up again .",
    "this is precisely what was found empirically in ",
    "[ dmsec ] , where inflation stalled at about the time that the homothetic scalar @xmath34 passed through a minimum in absolute value .    in summary",
    ", inflation comes to an end when the center - of - mass frame of the counter - streaming fluids switches from outgoing to ingoing .",
    "this condition is true even in the case where the baryonic density is a trace compared to the dark matter when mass inflation begins .",
    "this case corresponds to the small inflationary scale lengths @xmath164 attained at the right edge of figure  [ mr ] , where the accreted dark matter to baryonic density @xmath143 is near maximal .",
    "as mentioned in the commentary to figure  [ mr ] , even though the dark matter and baryonic densities are comparable at the sonic point boundary in this case , @xmath171 for the parameters of figure  [ mr ] , the baryonic density decreases by many orders of magnitude inside the black hole , so that indeed the baryonic density is driven to a trace compared to the dark matter density by the time mass inflation begins .",
    "but while the baryonic density diminishes , the components @xmath212 of the homothetic vector in the baryonic frame grow , with the net result that the baryonic contribution @xmath213 to the momentum density @xmath135 exceeds the dark matter contribution @xmath214 at the onset of inflation , even though @xmath215 .",
    "as mass inflation continues , the dark matter contribution to the momentum density @xmath135 grows relatively more important , as in the usual case .",

    "we state these two criteria below in the form of conjectures , couched in somewhat loose language .",

    "for example , ingoing fluid could possibly emit outgoing fluid , or vice versa , so the source of ingoing and outgoing fluids may not necessarily be accretion .",
    "the second conjectured key criterion is that the black hole should accrete ingoing fluid into the indefinite future .",
    "this comes from the idea that if the accretion of ingoing fluid is cut short , then the outgoing fluid will run through all the available ingoing fluid , and will then promptly drop through the cauchy horizon .",
    "it should also be commented that the definition of ingoing versus outgoing adopted in this paper and in paper  1 , that a frame is ingoing or outgoing according to whether the time component @xmath113 of the homothetic 4-vector is positive or negative , works only for self - similar solutions , since the homothetic vector exists only in self - similar solutions . an alternative definition that would work in a general spherically symmetric",
    "metric would be to define a frame as ingoing or outgoing according to the sign of the vierbein coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "this definition agrees with our adopted definition in the important mass - inflationary region near the inner horizon .",
    "indeed , it has been seen in  [ drive ] that the sign of @xmath22 is physically at the heart of mass inflation , because it is is the sign of @xmath22 that determines which direction is ` inward ' ( meaning the direction of smaller circumferential radius @xmath20 ) , and therefore in which direction the gravitational force operates , towards the black hole for ingoing fluid ( positive @xmath22 ) , and away from the black hole for outgoing fluid ( negative @xmath22 ) .",
    " v of paper  1 considered the question : what does it actually look like if you fall inside one of the black holes described in that paper ?",
    "this section addresses the same question for the black holes considered in the present paper .",
    "figure  [ appear ] shows , for the two models illustrated in figures  [ varsdm ] and [ varswm ] , the angular size @xmath216 and blueshift of photons from the edge of the black hole , as observed either in the baryonic rest frame or in the radially free - falling dark matter rest frame .",
    "the two points of view are related by a radial lorentz boost .",
    "the observed angular size @xmath216 of the black hole ( the subscript ph signifying photons from the photon sphere equivalent ) is given by equation  ( 73 ) of paper  1 , and the observed blueshift of photons at the edge of the black hole is given by equation  ( 74 ) of paper  1 .",
    "for the free - fall dark matter frame , equations  ( 73 ) and ( 74 ) of paper  1 apply with the baryonic homothetic vector @xmath212 replaced by its dark matter counterpart @xmath31 , equation  ( [ xid ] ) . the horizontal axis on figure  [ appear ]",
    "is the radius as measured in the corresponding frame , @xmath20 for the baryons , @xmath102 for the dark matter .",
    "figure  [ appear ] shows that , down to the point where mass inflation begins , the appearance of black holes accreting dark matter in addition to charged baryons is similar to the appearance of black holes accreting only charged baryons , middle panel of figure  12 of paper  1 . as discussed in  v of paper  1 , this appearance is in turn similar to that of the corresponding vacuum black hole , the reissner - nordstrm solution .    from the point of view of an outgoing observer , such as one in the baryonic rest frame , the black hole ( that is , any of the black holes considered in this paper ) increases in angular size",
    "until it covers almost the entire sky .",
    "the view of the outside universe correspondingly shrinks to a small , intensely bright , blueshifted point above the observer .",
    "as long as mass inflation continues , the point gets smaller , brighter , and more blueshifted .    from the point of view of an ingoing observer on the other hand , such as one in the free - fall dark matter rest frame ,",
    "the black hole ( again meaning any of the black holes considered in this paper ) first increases in angular size , but then shrinks as the observer approaches the inner horizon .",
    "in contrast to the outgoing observer who sees the outside universe concentrate to a small point , the ingoing observer sees the outside universe cover almost the whole sky . to the ingoing observer ,",
    "the sky near the edge of the black hole appears blueshifted , but the sky away from the edge is mostly redshifted . during mass inflation , the black hole continues to shrink , and to be surrounded by a concentrating , brightening halo .    in models where the dark matter is non - interacting , such as the model shown in the left panel of figure  [ appear ] , or where the dark matter has a finite ( not infinite ) cross - section for absorption by baryons , mass inflation eventually ceases , as discussed in   [ dmsec ] and [ stop ] .",
    "as mass inflation comes to an end , an outgoing observer , such as one in the baryonic frame , sees the view of the outside universe start to re - expand , and to become less bright and less blueshifted .",
    "as the outgoing baryons plunge to the singularity at zero radius , their view of the outside universe expands to a radius of @xmath217 .",
    "the @xmath217 view near the singularity is similar to that seen by an observer who falls into a schwarzschild black hole , and can be attributed to the same enormous tidal force that stretches the infaller radially and crushes them horizontally . as in the schwarzschild solution , the blueshift at the edge of the black hole tends to infinity as the outgoing baryonic observer approaches the singularity , but the amount of time that the observer sees pass by in the outside universe , the integral of blueshift over proper time , is finite .",
    "as remarked above , an ingoing observer sees a different view , a tiny black hole surrounded by a bright , blueshifted halo .",
    "the ingoing observer sees the halo become more concentrated , brighter , and more blueshifted , not only during mass inflation , but also thereafter , all the way down to the singularity at zero radius .",
    "although the blueshift around the black hole tends to infinity at the singularity , the ingoing observer sees , like the outgoing observer , only a finite time pass by in the outside universe .    in models where the dark matter absorption rate is effectively infinite at high energy , such as the model shown in the right panel of figure",
    "[ appear ] , the outgoing baryons drop though the cauchy horizon as soon as the ingoing dark matter is completely absorbed . if the outgoing baryons could see the outside universe ( which they can not , because by assumption there is no ingoing matter or radiation left to see ) , then as the outgoing baryons dropped through the cauchy horizon , their view of the outside universe would disappear in an infinitely bright , blueshifted , concentrated flash , in which the entire future of the outside universe passes by .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ appear ] shows the view seen by observers in the freely - falling ingoing dark matter frame , cut short once the dark matter has been completely absorbed .",
    "cutting the view short seems natural since the model is specifically constructed so that there is no ingoing fluid  no dark matter  beyond a certain point . however , if there were ingoing test particles ( with vanishing energy - momentum tensor ) , then their view would resemble that illustrated in the middle panel of figure  12 of paper  1 , in which the ingoing test particles fall to zero radius , encountering outgoing baryons accreted at ever earlier times , while the outgoing particles view of the outside universe blueshifts to infinity .",
    "as already mentioned , in most cases observers see only a finite time go by in the outside universe as they voyage to their doom inside the black hole .",
    "the exception is that if an outgoing observer drops through the cauchy horizon , then , if the outgoing observer could see the outside universe , the observer would see the entire future of the universe pass by .",
    "of course , the outgoing observer can drop through the cauchy horizon only if there is no ingoing fluid left , in which case the observer can not see the outside universe . in effect then , there is no case in which an infalling observer ever sees an infinite future go by .",
    "( color online ) ingoing dark matter and outgoing baryons streaming through each other at radius @xmath20 inside the black hole were accreted by the black hole at different times .",
    "the graph shows the ratio @xmath218 of ages of the black hole when the dark matter versus baryons were accreted .",
    "for example , a ratio @xmath219 means that the black hole was twice as old when it accreted the dark matter as it was when it accreted the baryons .",
    "the solid line is for the model with non - interacting dark matter shown in figure  [ varsdm ] , while the dashed line almost coincident with the solid line is for the model shown in figure  [ varsdm ] , in which the dark matter has an effectively infinite cross - section for absorption by baryons at high energy . ]    for the black holes illustrated in figure  [ appear ] , the amount of time that an infalling observer sees during their voyage into the black hole is quite modest .",
    "the baryons and dark matter that stream through each other inside the black hole were accreted at different ages @xmath12 and @xmath11 , and figure  [ raddm ] shows , for the two models illustrated in figures  [ appear ] , the ratio @xmath218 of these two ages at each point inside the black hole .",
    "the ratio of ages equals the reciprocal of the ratio of radii , @xmath220 , computed from equations  ( [ rx ] ) and ( [ rdx ] ) . for the non - interacting model",
    ", the ratio of ages tends to @xmath221 as @xmath222 .",
    "the ratio is only slightly different if the dark matter is massless instead of massive , @xmath223 as @xmath222 ( photons that do not scatter off baryons can be regarded as a kind of massless dark matter ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath224 as @xmath222 means that the baryons see a factor of two into the future : the baryons see dark matter which was accreted when the black hole was twice as old as when the black hole accreted the baryons .",
    "similarly , the dark matter sees a factor of two into the past : the dark matter sees baryons which were accreted when the black hole was half as old as when the black hole accreted the dark matter .",
    "roughly speaking , mass inflation ceases and the fluids collapses to a singularity when comparable masses of outgoing baryons and ingoing dark matter have been accreted .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath218 of ages would be larger if the ratio @xmath143 of accreted dark matter to baryonic density were reduced .",
    "figure  [ raddm ] shows that the case of the infinitely - interacting dark matter is similar to that of the non - interacting dark matter until the dark matter is completely absorbed , beyond which there is no dark matter left to see , or to be seen by , the baryons .    at the end of  v of paper  1 it was remarked that the function @xmath225 , which plays the essential part in ray - tracing , equation  ( 70 ) of paper  1 , was reasonably approximated as a cubic or quartic polynomial in @xmath124 .",
    "while this approximation remains satisfactory before mass inflation starts , it fails completely once mass inflation sets in . during and after mass inflation",
    ", @xmath124 hardly varies at all , while @xmath34 , as illustrated in figure  [ varsdm ] , varies by many , many orders of magnitude .",
    "in this the second of two companion papers , we have investigated self - similar solutions for spherically symmetric charged black holes that accrete a pressureless fluid of neutral dark matter ( massive or massless ) in addition to a relativistic fluid ( @xmath226 ) of charged baryons . the primary aim has been to investigate mass inflation .    as first pointed out by @xcite , the essential ingredient of mass",
    "inflation is the simultaneous presence of ingoing and outgoing fluids near the inner horizon . in the present paper ,",
    "the accreted charged baryonic fluid , repelled by the charge of the black hole generated self - consistently by previously accreted charged baryons , naturally becomes outgoing .",
    "the accreted dark matter , which is neutral , remains ingoing .",
    "relativistic counter - streaming between outgoing baryons and ingoing dark matter then leads to mass inflation near the inner horizon , as expected .    ",
    "[ inflation ] discussed the physical causes underlying mass inflation . in  [ nodrop ] we showed that , in the context of the similarity solutions considered in this paper , as long as ingoing and outgoing fluids are simultaneously present , then it is impossible for the fluids to drop through the inner horizon , because in order to do so the fluids would have to stream through each other faster than light , which is impossible .",
    "a corollary of this argument is that , if either of the ingoing or outgoing streams is exhausted , then the other stream can promptly drop through the inner horizon , an ingoing horizon if only ingoing fluid is present , or an outgoing ( cauchy ) horizon if only outgoing fluid is present .    as argued in ",
    "[ drive ] , the thing that drives ingoing and outgoing fluids to stream ever faster through each other during mass inflation is the inward gravitational force .",
    "the trick is that , in the region near the inner horizon , ` inward ' , meaning in the direction of smaller circumferential radius @xmath20 , means opposite directions for the ingoing and outgoing fluids . for ingoing fluid , the direction of smaller radius points towards the black hole , whereas for outgoing fluid , the direction of smaller radius points away from the black hole . in  [ drive ] , we remarked on the curious dual role played by the pressure contribution to the gravitational force . on the one hand , it is the negative radial pressure of the electric field that produces the gravitational repulsion that decelerates the inward flow of space into the black hole , and that therefore causes a vacuum black hole to contain an inner horizon . without this negative pressure",
    ", there would be no inner horizon , and no mass inflation .",
    "on the other hand , the same pressure contribution to the gravitational force , with an exponentially growing positive pressure rather than a passive negative pressure , provides the feedback loop that drives mass inflation .    since the simultaneous presence of outgoing ( baryonic ) and ingoing ( dark matter ) fluids is essential to mass inflation , one might have thought that mass inflation would be strongest in black holes which accrete comparable amounts of baryonic and dark matter . in the numerical experiments presented in  [ resultsbaryonsdm ] we found that , on the contrary , mass inflation becomes more extreme as one of the ingoing or outgoing streams is reduced to a trace relative to the other .",
    "thus , paradoxically , there is a huge difference between the case of no dark matter ( considered in paper  1 ) and the case of a tiny trace of dark matter . with no dark matter , the baryons can drop quietly through the cauchy horizon . with a trace of ingoing dark matter , the outgoing baryons can not drop through the cauchy horizon , and instead undergo extravagant mass inflation .    in the similarity solutions considered in the present paper ,",
    "mass inflation does not continue to an arbitrarily large value of the interior mass @xmath126 , but rather comes to an end .",
    "mass inflation ends at approximately the time that the center - of - mass frame of the counter - streaming fluids switches from outgoing to ingoing , whereafter the fluids collapse to a spacelike singularity at zero radius .",
    "it has widely been considered that a generic consequence of mass inflation is a weak null singularity on the cauchy horizon , and this conclusion is undoubtedly valid in the situation ( different from that considered in the present paper ) where the outgoing fluid is a power - law tail @xcite of radiation generated when the black hole first collapses .",
    "more recently burko @xcite , reporting numerical experiments on the collapse of a massless scalar field into a charged black hole , found that a null singularity forms only if the amplitude of the scalar field falls off sufficiently rapidly .",
    "it is not clear whether burko s criterion is essentially the same as that found here , but the results are at least consistent .",
    "a feature of mass inflation is that the streaming velocity between ingoing and outgoing fluids can reach huge lorentz gamma factors , which raises the question of whether it is physically plausible to allow relativistic streaming at immense energies . in  [ wmsec ] we explored numerically the consequences of allowing the dark matter to have a finite cross - section for being absorbed by the baryons .",
    "consistent with the conclusion that mass inflation becomes more extreme as the amount of dark matter is reduced to a trace , we find that increasing the absorption rate merely makes mass inflation more extreme .",
    "the only caveat to this conclusion is that if the absorption rate is infinite above some collision energy , then the ingoing dark matter is absorbed completely , whereupon the outgoing baryons can drop promptly through the cauchy horizon .    in  [ appearance ]",
    "we discussed what an observer who falls inside one of the black holes considered in this paper would see . among other things",
    ", we found that in all cases an infalling observer witnesses only a finite amount of time pass by in the outside universe .",
    "this is true even for an observer who drops through the cauchy horizon , because although such an observer would , if they could see the outside universe , see the entire future of the universe pass by as they dropped through the cauchy horizon , in fact the observer can not see the outside universe , because photons that come unscattered from the outside universe are necessarily ingoing , and an outgoing observer can not pass through the cauchy horizon as long as there is any trace of ingoing matter or radiation .",
