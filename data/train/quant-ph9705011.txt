    "the singularities of the analytically continued s - matrix that have attracted most of the attention in the past are the first order poles in the second sheet .",
    "they were associated with resonances that decay exponentially in time .",
    "@xcite in conventional hilbert space quantum theory it was not clear what those resonance `` states '' were , since a vector description of a resonance state was not possible within the framework of the hilbert space.@xcite higher order poles , in particular double poles have also been mentioned , but it has long been believed that they somehow lead to an additional polynomial time dependence of the decay law  @xcite . however , precise derivations were not possible due to the lack of a vector space description .",
    "this changed when the first order poles were associated with vectors @xmath6 in a rigged hilbert space ( rhs )  @xcite , called gamow vectors .",
    "they possess all the properties that one needs to describe decaying states or resonances : these gamow vectors @xmath7 are eigenvectors of a self - adjoint hamiltonian  @xcite with complex eigenvalues @xmath1 ( energy and width ) .",
    "they evolve exponentially in time , and they have a breit - wigner energy distribution .",
    "they also obey an exact golden rule , which becomes the standard golden rule if one replaces @xmath7 with its born approximation .",
    "the existence of these vectors allows us to interpret resonances as autonomous physical systems ( which one can not do in standard quantum mechanics ) .",
    "it also puts quasibound states ( i.e. resonances ) and anti - bound ( or virtual ) states  @xcite on the same footing with the bound states ( eigenvectors with real energy ) , which have both a vector description and an s - matrix description .",
    "mathematically , gamow vectors are a generalization of dirac kets ( describing scattering states ) , i.e. they are also eigenkets . but whereas dirac kets are associated with a value of the continuous hilbert space spectrum of the self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath8 , the gamow kets are not , but have complex eigenvalues .    using the entirely different theory of finite dimensional complex matrices , decaying states ( like the @xmath9 system )",
    "have been phenomenologically described as eigenvectors of an effective hamiltonian matrix with complex eigenvalues .",
    "one usually assumes that these complex hamiltonians are diagonalizable  @xcite .",
    "however , unlike hermitean matrices which have real eigenvalues , non - hermitean finite dimensional matrices can not always be diagonalized , but can only be brought into a jordan canonical form  @xcite .",
    "finite dimensional matrices consisting of non - diagonalizable jordan blocks have been mentioned in connection with resonances numerous times in the past  @xcite , and they have been used for discussions of problems in nuclear  @xcite and in hadron  @xcite physics .",
    "jordan blocks have also been obtained in prototypes of mixing systems  @xcite , and the appearance of so - called `` irreducible '' non - diagonalizable blocks in the density matrix has been sought after for some time in connection with irreversible thermodynamics and the approach to equilibrium  @xcite . that irreducible non - diagonalizable jordan blocks may shed light on the idea of quantum chaos has been mentioned by brndas and dreismann  @xcite . also important for the understanding of quantum chaos and of the statistical properties of nuclear spectra are accidental degeneracies and level crossing , which in the past had been almost exclusively restricted to stable systems driven by hermitean hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "based on a finite dimensional phenomenological expression for the s - matrix  @xcite , mondragn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite extended these discussions to resonance states described by a jordan block of rank @xmath10 .",
    "in the present paper we shall show that the jordan blocks emerge naturally for the matrix elements @xmath11 of a self - adjoint  @xcite hamiltonian @xmath8 between gamow vectors @xmath12 of order @xmath13 . from the generalized basis vector expansion derived here it follows that these @xmath0-dimensional blocks are a truncation of the infinite dimensional exact theory in the rhs .",
    "the higher order gamow vectors @xmath12 have been derived in a recent unpublished preprint by antoniou and gadella  @xcite .",
    "the derivation is a generalization of the method by which the gamow vector ( of order @xmath14 ) was derived from the first order poles of the s - matrix  @xcite . starting from an @xmath0-th order pole of the s - matrix element at complex energy @xmath15 , they derived @xmath0 gamow vectors of higher order , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , as functionals in a rigged hilbert space .",
    "these higher order gamow kets are also jordan vectors belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath18 .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the rhs theory of the gamow vectors associated with first order s - matrix poles , which we call gamow vectors of order zero , to poles of order @xmath0 .",
    "quasistationary states in scattering experiments ( i.e. states formed if the projectile is temporarily captured by the target ) can be shown to appear not only as first order poles , but as poles of any order @xmath19 ( @xcite ) . in section  [ sec : poles ]",
    ", we will start from the expression for the unitary s - matrix of a quasistationary state of finite order @xmath0 and energy @xmath20 , given in reference  @xcite sect .",
    "xviii.6 , and obtain from it @xmath0 gamow vectors of order @xmath21 which are also jordan vectors of degree @xmath22 .",
    "after a review of the case @xmath23 in section  [ sec : summary ] , we derive in section  [ sec : higher ] the generalized eigenvector expansion , which contains the gamow - jordan vectors as basis vectors . with these basis vectors",
    "we can give a matrix representation of @xmath8 and of @xmath24 which contains the @xmath0-dimensional jordan blocks .",
    "in section  [ sec : possible ] , we start from the pole term of the @xmath0-th order s - matrix pole and conjecture the state operator for the hypothetical microphysical system associated with this pole .",
    "this @xmath0-th order gamow state operator consists of non - diagonalizable blocks which obey a purely exponential decay law .",
    "this unexpected result is in contrast to the belief  @xcite that higher order poles must lead to an additional polynomial time dependence .    at the present time there is little empirical evidence for the existence of these higher order pole `` states '' in nature",
    "this is in marked contrast to the fact that first order pole states described by ordinary gamow vectors have been identified in abundance , e.g. through their breit - wigner profile in scattering experiments and through their exponential decay law .",
    "now that our results have obliterated the prime empirical objection of non - exponentiality against the existence of higher order pole states , one can continue to look for them .",
    "the first step in this direction is to use these higher order state operators in the exact golden rule  @xcite and obtain the decay probability and the decay rate , including the line widths .",
    "we plan to do this in a forthcoming paper .",
    "since the new ( hypothetical ) states are to be defined by the @xmath0-th order pole of the s - matrix , we consider a scattering system .",
    "the s - matrix consists of the matrix elements  @xcite @xmath25 since we are interested only in the principles here , in equation ( [ eq : outmatrix ] ) ( and in subsequent equations ) we choose to ignore all other labels of the basis vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 except the energy label @xmath28 , which can take values on a two - sheeted riemann surface .",
    "nothing principally new will be gained if we retain the additional quantum numbers @xmath29 in the basis system @xmath30 , and in place of the integral over the energy we would just have some additional sums ( or integrals in the case that some of the @xmath31 s are continuous ) over the quantum numbers @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , if one chooses the angular momentum basis @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are some additional ( polarization or ) channel quantum numbers ( cf .",
    "@xcite , sect .",
    "xx.2 , xxi.4 ) , then  ( [ eq : outmatrix ] ) would read in detail @xmath34 restricting ourselves to one initial @xmath35 and one final @xmath36 channel ( e.g. , @xmath37 for elastic scattering ) we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40-th partial s - matrix element for scattering from the channel @xmath41 into one particular channel @xmath42 ( e.g. , the elastic channel , @xmath37 ) .",
    "if we consider the @xmath40-th partial wave of the @xmath42-th channel , then the @xmath43 in ( [ eq : outmatrix ] ) is given by this matrix element @xmath44 .",
    "e.g. , if we consider a mass point in a potential barrier , then @xmath45 is the angular momentum basis of the mass point and , depending on the shape and height of the barrier , one or several resonances can exist .",
    "many concrete examples have been studied where one can see how first order resonance poles @xmath46 move as a function of the potential parameters  @xcite .",
    "we want to consider just one pole , and in the present paper we are mainly interested in a higher order pole at @xmath18 .",
    "whether physical systems exist that are described by higher order poles is not clear , but a few examples of second order poles have been discussed in the past  @xcite  @xcite .    with the above simplifications to one channel @xmath42 and one partial wave @xmath40 ,",
    "the notation in ( [ eq : outmatrix ] ) is standard in scattering theory .",
    "the standard scattering theory uses the same hilbert space @xmath47 for both the set of in - states @xmath48 and the set of out-``states '' @xmath49 .",
    "the rhs formulation allows us to use two rhs s for the set @xmath50 defined by the initial conditions and the set @xmath51 defined by the final conditions .",
    "to explain this we subdivide the scattering experiment into a preparation stage and a registration stage , as explained in detail in reference  @xcite .",
    "1 depicts these different stages illustrating the idealized process : the in - state @xmath48 ( precisely the state which evolves from the prepared in - state @xmath52 outside the interaction region where @xmath53 is zero ) is determined by the accelerator .",
    "the so - called out - state @xmath49 ( or @xmath54 ) is determined by the detector ; @xmath55 is therefore the observable which the detector registers and not a state . in the conventional formulation one describes both the @xmath52 and the @xmath54 by any vectors of the hilbert space . in reality",
    "the @xmath52 ( or @xmath48 ) and @xmath54 ( or @xmath49 ) are subject to different initial and boundary conditions and are therefore described by different sets of vectors belonging to different rigged hilbert spaces .",
    "the rhs for the dirac kets is denoted by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the space of the `` well - behaved '' vectors ( schwartz space ) , and the dirac kets ( scattering states ) @xmath58 and @xmath27 are elements of @xmath59 .",
    "the in - state vectors @xmath60 evolve from the prepared in - state @xmath61 and the out - observable vectors @xmath62 evolve into the measured out - state @xmath63.@xcite    we denote the space of @xmath50 by @xmath64 and the space of @xmath51 by @xmath65 .",
    "then , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 . in place of the single rigged hilbert space ( [ eq : rhs ] ) , one therefore has a pair of rigged hilbert spaces :    [ eq : rhsm][bohm6 ] ^+ _ -^_- & & + & & + & & + ^- _",
    "+ ^_+ & & [ bohm7 ] + & &    the hilbert space @xmath47 in ( [ eq : rhs ] ) , ( [ bohm6]a ) , and ( [ bohm7]b ) is the same , but @xmath65 and @xmath64 are two distinct spaces of `` very well - behaved '' vectors . the spaces @xmath65 and @xmath64 can be defined mathematically in terms of the spaces of their wave functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "this is the realization of these abstract spaces by spaces of functions , in very much the same way as the hilbert space @xmath47 is realized by the space of lebesgue square - integrable functions @xmath70 .",
    "the space @xmath64 is realized by the space of well - behaved hardy class functions in the lower half - plane of the second energy sheet of the s - matrix @xmath43 , and the space @xmath65 is realized by the space of well - behaved hardy class functions in the upper half - plane .",
    "thus , the mathematical definition of the spaces @xmath71 and @xmath72 is : @xmath73 and @xmath74 here @xmath75 denotes the schwartz space and @xmath76 is the space of hardy class functions from above / below .",
    "this mathematical property of the spaces @xmath65 and @xmath64 can be shown to be a consequence of the arrow of time inherent in every scattering experiment  @xcite .",
    "being hardy class from below means that the analytic continuation @xmath77 of @xmath78 , and the analytic continuation @xmath79 of @xmath68 , and therewith also @xmath80 , are analytic functions in the lower half - plane which vanish fast enough on the lower infinite semicircle .",
    "( for the precise definition , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the values of a hardy class function in the lower half - plane are already determined by its values on the positive real axis  @xcite . from ( [ eq:2.11a ] ) and ( [ eq:2.11b ] )",
    "follows that @xmath81 and so are all its derivatives @xmath82 because the derivation is continuous in @xmath83 .    with the above preparations one can derive the vectors that are associated with the @xmath0-th order pole of the s - matrix for any value of @xmath0 , in complete analogy to the derivation of the vectors associated with the first order poles , @xmath23.@xcite    we shall see that there are @xmath0 generalized vectors of order @xmath84 associated with an @xmath0-th order pole .",
    "we call these vectors the higher order gamow vectors , or gamow - jordan vectors ( since they also have the properties of jordan vectors  @xcite ) . their first derivation from the @xmath0-th order pole was given in  @xcite . here",
    "we give an alternative derivation and discuss their properties and applications in the generalized basis vector expansion .",
    "we consider the model in which the analytically continued s - matrix @xmath85 has one @xmath0-th order pole at the position @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) in the lower half - plane of the second sheet , ( and consequently there is also one @xmath0-th order pole in the upper half - plane of the second sheet at @xmath88 ) . in this paper we will not discuss the pole at @xmath89 .",
    "it leads to @xmath0 growing higher order gamow vectors and the correspondence between the growing and decaying vectors is just the same as for the case @xmath23 .",
    "the model that we discuss here can easily be extended to any finite number of finite order poles in the second sheet below the positive real axis .",
    "the unitary s - matrix of a quasistationary state associated with an @xmath0-th order pole at @xmath1 is represented in the lower half - plane of the second sheet by ( @xcite sect .",
    "xviii.6 ) @xmath90 here , @xmath91 is the rapidly varying resonant part of the phase shift , and @xmath92 is the background phase shift , which is a slowly varying function of the complex energy @xmath93 .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the case that the @xmath0-th order pole is the only singularity of the s - matrix . below",
    "we will mention how this can be generalized to the case of a finite number of finite order poles .",
    "( note that phenomenologically only a finite number of first order poles have been established , but there is no theoretical reason that would prevent other isolated singularities on the second sheet below the real axis . )    for our calculations we have to write  ( [ b16a ] ) in the form of a laurent series : @xmath94 therefore we expand the bracket in  ( [ b16a ] ) : @xmath95 we insert this into  ( [ eq : outmatrix ] ) and deform the contour of integration through the cut along the spectrum of @xmath8 into the second sheet , as shown in fig .",

    "the contour @xmath98 can be deformed into the negative axis of the second sheet from 0 to @xmath99 .",
    "we shall set this background integral aside for the moment .",

    "since the kets @xmath106 are ( like the dirac kets @xmath107 ) only defined up to an arbitrary factor or , if their `` normalization '' is already fixed , up to a phase factor we absorb the background phase @xmath108 into the kets @xmath106 and define new vectors @xmath109 ( note that the phase is not trivial since e.g. @xmath110 . ) for the case that the slowly varying background phase @xmath92 is constant , the @xmath111 are up to a totally trivial constant phase factor identical with @xmath106 ; but in general  ( [ b18a ] ) is a non - trivial gauge transformation . for the case of a first order resonance pole , @xmath112 in  ( [ bohm18 ] ) , the phase transformation  ( [ b18a ] ) is also irrelevant , because for @xmath113 no derivatives are involved in  ( [ bohm18 ] ) . using the phase transformed vectors  ( [ b18a ] ) we can proceed in the same way as if we were using the @xmath106 with @xmath114 .    taking the derivatives , we rewrite  ( [ bohm18 ] ) as : @xmath115 in here , we denote by @xmath116 the @xmath105-th derivative of the analytic function @xmath117 , and with @xmath118 its value at @xmath15 .",

    "again , @xmath123 is analytic in the lower half - plane with its boundary value on the real axis being @xmath124 .",
    "the case @xmath23 ( and therefore @xmath113 and @xmath14 in  ( [ bohmprime ] ) ) is the well - known case of the first order pole term , which led to the definition of the ordinary gamow vectors for breit - wigner resonance states  @xcite .",
    "we shall review its properties in section  [ sec : summary ] . in section  [ sec : higher ] we shall then discuss the general @xmath0-th order pole term and the generalized vectors @xmath125 , @xmath13 . these vectors we call gamow vectors of order @xmath5 or gamow - jordan vectors of degree @xmath22 , for reasons that will become clear in section  [ sec : higher ] .",
    "for the case @xmath23 we obtain from  ( [ bohm18 ] ) and  ( [ bohmprime ] ) : @xmath127 the integral in  ( [ bohm19 ] ) is obtained from the integral in ( [ bohm18 ] ) by deforming the contour of integration into the real axis of the second sheet plus the infinite semicircle and omitting in  ( [ bohm18 ] ) the integral over the infinite semicircle in the lower half - plane of the second sheet , because it is zero .",

    "the definition ( [ eq:5.32 ] ) of the gamow vector is , like ( [ eq : regular ] ) and ( [ eq:5.33 ] ) , just another example of the titchmarsh theorem . from the above derivation",
    ", one can see why we defined the gamow vectors : they are the vectors associated with the pole term of the s - matrix element .",
    "the `` normalization '' of the vectors @xmath138 is a consequence of the `` normalization '' of the dirac kets @xmath107 , and we can define gamow vectors @xmath7 with arbitrary normalization and phase @xmath142 ,    [ eq:5.34][bohm22 ] ^g = |z^-_rn(z_r ) .",

    "xxi.4 )    the notation @xmath138 has a further meaning : it can be shown  @xcite that this vector is a generalized eigenvector of the self - adjoint  @xcite hamiltonian @xmath8 with eigenvalue @xmath1 : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the conjugate operator in @xmath59 of the operator @xmath8 in @xmath57 .",
    "this one writes as @xmath148 or following dirac s notation @xmath149 @xmath150 if the operator @xmath8 is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "if one takes the complex conjugate of ( [ bohm23 ] ) one obtains : @xmath151 which one can write in analogy to  ( [ bohm24 ] ) as @xmath152    it has also been shown  @xcite that in the rhs  ( [ bohm7]b ) the time evolution is given by a semigroup operator @xmath153 ( a similar semigroup time evolution operator @xmath154 , defined however only for @xmath155 , also exists in the rhs ( [ eq : rhsm]a ) and has similar properties . ) and it has been shown that this time evolution operator ( [ eq:5.88 ] ) acts on the gamow vectors @xmath7 ( or on the @xmath156 ) in the following way : @xmath157 or for the complex conjugate @xmath158 omitting the arbitrary @xmath132 , this is also written in analogy to  ( [ bohm24 ] ) as    [ eq:5.89prime][paul30][bohm30 ] e^-ih^t_+^g&=&e^-ie_r te^-(/2)t^g + or & & + ^g |e^iht&=&e^+ie_r te^-(/2)t ^g|t0 .",
    "one of the most important features of the gamow vectors is that they are basis vectors of a basis system expansion . to explain this we start with the dirac basis vector expansion ( the nuclear spectral theorem of the rigged hilbert space ) which states that @xmath159 in here , @xmath160 are the discrete eigenvectors of the exact hamiltonian @xmath161 , describing the bound states , latexmath:[$h\\ , |e_m)= e_m\\ ,    ( dirac kets ) of @xmath8 , describing scattering states  @xcite .",

    "the expansion ( [ eq : basisexpansion ] ) follows directly from ( [ bohm17 ] ) for @xmath23 ( if one assumes that the s - matrix has no other singularities in the lower half - plane besides the @xmath169 first order poles at the positions @xmath165 , which is a realistic assumption if one excludes higher order poles  @xcite ) .",

    "still , it is intuitively attractive to imagine that the effect by which the preparation apparatus acts on the registration apparatus is carried by single physical entities , the microphysical systems  @xcite .",
    "according to the physical interpretation of the rhs formulation , `` real '' physical entities connected with an experimental apparatus , like the states @xmath366 defined by the preparation apparatus or the property @xmath367 defined by the registration apparatus , are assumed to be elements of @xmath57 , but states and observables are distinct . in particular , states and observables of a scattering experiment are distinct and described by @xmath72 of  ( [ bohm6]a ) and @xmath71 of  ( [ bohm6]b ) .",

    "whether the microphysical state of the ( hypothetical ) quasistationary microphysical system is always represented by the mathematical object  ( [ g69a]b ) or whether also each individual @xmath384 has a separate physical meaning , is not clear .",
    "so far it is not even certain that higher order poles of the s - matrix describe anything in nature ( though there are no theoretical reasons that exclude these isolated singularities of the s - matrix . )",
    "but if these hypothetical objects do exist , the @xmath0-th order pole is associated with a mixed state  ( [ g69a]b ) whose irreducible components are given by  ( [ g69b]b ) .",
    "e.g. , for the case @xmath237 ( second order pole at @xmath18 ) we have : @xmath385 and @xmath386 and @xmath387 this means that the conjectural physical state associated with the @xmath0-th order pole is a mixed state @xmath380 , all of whose components @xmath388 , except for the zeroth component @xmath389 , can not be reduced further into `` pure '' states given by dyadic products like @xmath390 .",
    "this is quite consistent with our earlier remark that the label @xmath5 is not a quantum number connected with an observable ( like the suppressed labels @xmath391 ) .",
    "therefore a `` pure state '' with a definite value of @xmath5 , like @xmath390 , @xmath392 , does not make sense physically .",
    "a physical interpretation could only be given to the whole @xmath0-dimensional space @xmath261 , ( [ bohm48 ] ) .",
    "the individual @xmath388 , @xmath393 , act in the subspaces @xmath394 which are spanned by gamow vectors of order @xmath395 ( jordan vectors of degree @xmath396 , i.e. @xmath397 ) . there",
    "the question is , whether there could be a physical meaning to each @xmath388 separately , or whether only the particular mixture @xmath380 given by  ( [ g69a]b ) can occur physically .",
    "though the quantities @xmath390 will have no physical meaning , even if higher order poles exist , they have been considered  @xcite and their time evolution is calculated in a straightforward way from  ( [ b66 ] ) : @xmath398 this time dependence ( as well as the time dependence in  ( [ b66 ] ) ) is reminiscent of eq .",
    "( [ bohm45 ] ) in the reference of m.  l. goldberger and k.  m. watson  @xcite .",
    "it shows the additional polynomial time dependence , that has always been considered an obstacle to the use of higher order poles for quasistationary states .",
    "a polynomial time dependence of this magnitude ( of the order of @xmath399 ) should have shown up in many experiments .",
    "we now derive the time evolution of the microphysical state operator defined in  ( [ g69b]b ) using the time evolution obtained for the gamow - jordan vector in  ( [ b67 ] ) .",
    "it will turn out that this operator , whose form was conjectured in analogy to the pole term  ( [ g69b]a ) , will have a purely exponential time evolution .",
    "this was quite unexpected .    inserting  ( [ b67]a ) and",
    "( [ b67]b ) into @xmath400 we calculate : @xmath401 in going from the second to the third line , the order of summation has been changed , by keeping the same terms , as displayed in fig .  3 for the case @xmath402 .",
    "in going from the third to the fourth line one uses the identity @xmath403 where @xmath404 are binomial coefficients .    , the summation terms labeled by the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath40 , and @xmath405 are displayed as dots in the diagram to show that the summations of lines 2 and 3 of  ( [ marc5.20 ] ) both contain the same terms . ]",
    "since the indices labeling the gamow - jordan vectors do not depend upon @xmath5 , the sum over @xmath5 may be performed using the binomial formula : @xmath406 inserting  ( [ b82 ] ) into the fourth line of  ( [ marc5.20 ] ) and performing the sum over @xmath40 then gives : @xmath407    this means that the complicated non - reducible ( i.e. `` mixed '' ) microphysical state operator @xmath388 defined by  ( [ g69b]b ) has a simple purely exponential semigroup time evolution , like the zeroth order gamow state  ( [ g68b]b ) .",
    "this operator is probably the only operator formed by the dyadic products @xmath408 with @xmath409 , which has a purely exponential time evolution .",
    "thus @xmath388 of eq .  ( [ g69b]b ) is distinguished from all other operators in @xmath410 .",
    "the microphysical decaying state operator associated with the @xmath0-th order pole of the unitary s - matrix is according to its definition  ( [ g69a]b ) a sum of the @xmath388 .",
    "because of the simple form  ( [ b82 ] ) ( independence of the time evolution of @xmath105 ) this sum has again a simple and exponential time evolution @xmath411 thus we have seen that the state operator which we conjecture from the @xmath0-th order pole term describes a non - reducible `` mixed '' microphysical decaying state which obeys an exact exponential decay law .",
    "we can return to the question that we started with when we set out to conjecture the state operator for the ( hypothetical ) microphysical state associated with the @xmath0-th order s - matrix pole : what is the probability to register at the time @xmath324 the decay products @xmath412 ( or in general latexmath:[$\\lambda\\equiv\\sum_i    microphysical state was given by @xmath380 of  ( [ g69a]b ) ? from  ( [ b83 ] ) we obtain @xmath414 or in the special case of @xmath415 : @xmath416 this is exactly the same result as the result  ( [ g62]b ) for the microphysical state @xmath353 associated with the first order pole of the s - matrix and the result which is in agreement with the experiments on the decay of quasistationary states .",
    "it is , however , important to note that in our derivation of  ( [ b82 ] ) and  ( [ b85 ] ) we proceeded in a very specific order .",
    "we first derived  ( [ b82 ] ) from  ( [ b67]a ) and  ( [ b67]b ) and then calculated the matrix elements with @xmath49 and not vice versa in order to avoid problems with the analyticity .",
    "vectors that possess all the properties that one needs in order to describe a pure state of a resonance have been known for two decades .",
    "these gamow vectors @xmath7 are eigenvectors of a self - adjoint hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues @xmath417 ( energy and width ) , they are associated with resonance poles of the s - matrix , they evolve exponentially in time , and they have a breit - wigner energy distribution .",
    "they also obey an exact golden rule , which becomes the standard golden rule in the limit of the born approximation .",
    "the existence of these vectors in the rigged hilbert space allows us to interpret exponentially decaying resonances as autonomous microphysical systems , which one can not do in standard hilbert space quantum mechanics .",
    "the mathematical procedure by which these gamow vectors had been introduced suggests a straightforward generalization to higher order gamow vectors which are derived from higher order s - matrix poles .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the @xmath0-th order pole of a unitary s - matrix leads to @xmath0 generalized eigenvectors of order @xmath418 .",
    "these @xmath5-th order gamow vectors are jordan vectors of degree @xmath3 with complex eigenvalue @xmath417 .",
    "they are basis elements of a generalized eigenvector expansion .",
    "but their time evolution has in addition to the exponential time dependence also a polynomial time dependence , which is excluded experimentally .",
    "however , the generalized eigenvector expansion suggests the definition of a state operator for microphysical decaying states of higher order .",
    "these state operators can not be expressed as dyadic products of generalized vectors . but these state operators have a purely exponential time evolution .",
    "there has been a lot of interest in the jordan blocks for various applications ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "here it has been shown that jordan blocks arise naturally from higher order s - matrix poles and represent a self - adjoint hamiltonian  @xcite by a complex matrix in a finite dimensional subspace contained in the rigged hilbert space .",
    "although higher order s - matrix poles are not excluded theoretically , there has been so far very little experimental evidence for their existence , because they were always believed to have polynomial time dependence . since we have shown here that their non - reducible state operator evolves purely exponential in time there is reason to hope that these mathematically beautiful objects will have some application in physics .",
    "the inspiration for this paper came from three sources : prof .",
    "a. mondragon s talk at the 1994 workshop on nonlinear , deformed and irreversible quantum systems  @xcite , which showed us the importance of jordan blocks ; profs .",
    "i. antoniou and m.  gadella s unpublished preprint of spring 1995  @xcite , which demonstrated that the jordan vectors are gamow vectors of higher order s - matrix poles ; and prof .",
