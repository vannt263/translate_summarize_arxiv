    "in network communications , the communication could fail if some nodes or some edges are broken .",
    "though the failure of a modem could be considered the failure of a node , we can model this scenario also as the failure of the communication link ( the edge ) attached to this modem .",
    "thus it is sufficient to consider edge failures in communication networks .",
    "it is also important to note that several nodes ( or edges ) in a network could fail at the same time .",
    "for example , all brand x routers in a network could fail at the same time due to a platform dependent computer worm ( virus ) attack . in order to design survivable communication networks , it is essential to consider this kind of homogeneous faults for networks .",
    "existing works on network quality of services have not addressed this issue in detail and there is no existing model to study network reliability in this aspect . in this paper , we use the colored edge graphs which could be used to model homogeneous faults in networks .",
    "the model is then used to optimize the design of survivable networks and to study the minimum connectivity ( and design ) requirements of networks for being robust against homogeneous faults within certain thresholds .",
    "a colored edge graph is a tuple @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the node set , @xmath2 the edge set , @xmath3 the color set , and @xmath4 a map from @xmath2 onto @xmath3 .",
    "the structure @xmath5 be distinct nodes of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 are called @xmath8-_color connected _ for @xmath9 if for any color set @xmath10 of size @xmath11 , there is a path @xmath12 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 in @xmath6 such that the edges on @xmath12 do not contain any color in @xmath15 . a colored edge graph @xmath6 is @xmath8-_color connected _ if and only if for any two nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath6 , they are @xmath8-color connected .",
    "the interpretation of the above definition is as follows . in a network ,",
    "if two edges have the same color , then they could fail at the same time .",
    "this may happen when the two edges are designed with same technologies ( e.g. , with same operating systems , with same application software , with same hardware , or with same hardware and software ) .",
    "if a colored edge network is @xmath8-color connected , then the network communication is robust againt the failure of edges of any @xmath11 colors ( that is , the adversary may tear down any @xmath11 types of devices ) .    in practice",
    ", one communication link may be attached to different brands of network devices ( e.g. , routers , modems ) on both sides . for this case ,",
    "the edge can have two different colors .",
    "if any of these colors is broken , the edge is broken .",
    "thus from a reliability viewpoint , if one designs networks with two colors on the same edge , the same reliability / security can be obtained by having only one color on each edge . in the following discussion",
    ", we will only consider the case with one color on each edge .",
    "meanwhile , multiple edges between two nodes are not allowed either .",
    "we are interested in the following practical questions . for a given number @xmath16 of nodes in @xmath1 ( i.e. , the number of network nodes ) , a given number @xmath17 of the colors ( e.g. , the number of network device types ) , and a given number @xmath11 , how can we design a @xmath8-color connected colored edge graphs @xmath18 with minimum number @xmath19 of edges ? in another words , how can we use minimum resources ( e.g. , communication links ) to design a network that will keep working even if @xmath11 types of devices in the network fail ?    for practical network designs",
    ", one needs first to have an estimate on the number of homogeneous faults .",
    "for example , the number @xmath11 of brands of routers that could fail at the same time .",
    "then it is sufficient to design a @xmath8-color connected network with @xmath20 colors ( e.g. , with @xmath21 different brands of routers ) .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for this kind of network design will be obtained in this paper .",
    "another important issue that should be taken into consideration in practical network designs is that the number @xmath17 of colors ( e.g. , the number of brands for routers ) is quite small .",
    "for example , @xmath17 is normally less than five .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for network designs with @xmath22 and with optimized resources will be obtained in this paper .",
    "note that for cases with small @xmath17 , we may have @xmath23 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ meqtp1sec ] describes the necessary and sufficient conditions for the case of @xmath20 without optimizing the number of edges in the networks .",
    "section [ generalnecsec ] gives a necessary condition for colored edge networks in terms of optimized number of edges .",
    "section [ practiffsec ] shows that the necessary conditions in section [ generalnecsec ] are also sufficient for the most important three cases : ( 1 ) @xmath20 ; ( 2 ) @xmath24 ; and ( 3 ) @xmath22 .",
    "section [ hardsec ] shows that it is * np*-hard to determine whether a given colored edge graph is @xmath8-connected .",
    "though colored - edge graph is a new concept which we used to model network survivability issues , there are related research topics in this field . for example , edge - disjoint ( colorful ) spanning trees have been extensively studied in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these results are mainly related to our discussion in the next section for the case of @xmath20 .",
    "a colored edge graph @xmath6 is _ proper _ if whenever two edges share an end point they carry different colors . a spanning tree for a colored edge graph is called colorful if no two of its edges have the same color .",
    "two spanning trees of a graph are edge disjoint if they do not share common edges . for a non - negative integer @xmath25 , let @xmath26 denote the complete graph on @xmath25 vertices .",
    "a classical result of euler states that the edges of @xmath27 can be partitioned into @xmath16 isomorphic spanning trees ( paths , for example ) and each of these spanning trees can easily be made colorful , but the resulting edge colored graph usually fails to be proper .",
    "though it is important to design colored edge graphs with required security parameters , for several scenarios it is also important to calculate the robustness of a given colored edge graphs .",
    "roskind and tarjan @xcite designed a greedy algorithm to find @xmath8-edge disjoint spanning trees in a given graph .",
    "this is related to the questions @xmath8-color connectivity for the case of @xmath20 .",
    "we are not aware of any approximate algorithms for deciding @xmath8-color connectivity of a given colored edge graph .",
    "indeed , we will show that this problem is * np*-hard .",
    "in this section , we show necessary and sufficient conditions for some special cases .",
