    "decompositions of finite sets go on to play a defining role in the theory .",
    "given two decompositions @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the same set @xmath10 , there is a natural way to refine @xmath16 using @xmath17 in order to obtain another decomposition @xmath21 of @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to @xmath21 as the tits product of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this turns the set of all decompositions of @xmath10 into a monoid ( in the usual sense of the term ) .",
    "we refer to the algebra of this monoid as the tits algebra of decompositions of @xmath10 .",
    "a bimonoid is a species @xmath6 which is at the same time a monoid and a comonoid , with the structures linked by the usual compatibility axiom .",
    "the tits product appears implicitly in this axiom .",
    "this becomes evident when the compatibility among the higher product and coproduct maps is spelled out .",
    "the axiom then involves two arbitrary decompositions @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath10 , and their tits products @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "this is one aspect in which the theory of hopf monoids differs from that of graded hopf algebras .",
    "we pay particular attention to set - theoretic hopf monoids ( in which the role of vector spaces is played by sets ) and connected hopf monoids ( in which @xmath23={\\bbbk}$ ] , the base field ) .",
    "these are discussed in sections  [ s : set ] and  [ s : connected ] .",

    "most of them are connected and at least part of their structure is set - theoretic .",
    "they arise from various combinatorial structures ranging from linear orders to generalized permutahedra , which then get organized into hopf monoids and related to one another by means of morphisms of such .",
    "solutions to the antipode problem are provided in most cases . among these , we highlight those in theorems  [ t : apode - graph ] and  [ t : apode - gp ] .",

    "the structure of the tits algebra @xmath34 $ ] has been studied in detail in the literature .",

    "the garsia - reutenauer idempotent indexed by the partition with one block is the first eulerian idempotent , hence its action is a projection onto the primitive part .",

    "the notion of hopf monoid parallels the more familiar one of graded hopf algebra and the analogy manifests itself throughout our discussion .",
    "much of the theory we develop has a counterpart for graded hopf algebras , with hopf monoids being richer due to the underlying species structure . to illustrate this point ,",

    "for connected hopf monoids , they are indexed by elements of the tits algebra , while for connected graded hopf algebras they are indexed by elements of solomon s descent algebra .",
