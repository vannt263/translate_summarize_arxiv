    "after almost one century of theoretical works to understand the existence , analysis and creation of a new state of matter at ultracold temperatures , the first experimental observation of a bose - einstein condensate was presented in refs .",
    "nowadays , bose - einstein condensates are well established as a distinguished form of quantum matter enabling in situ studies of most disparate physical phenomena , such as josephson oscillations  @xcite , or anderson localization  @xcite , on a micrometer scale .    in the limit of zero temperature and weak interactions , where all atoms of the gas can be assumed to share the same single particle quantum state , the dynamics of the condensate",
    "is described accurately by the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite .",
    "finite temperature effects at thermal equilibrium are accounted for within higher order perturbation theories  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , only few theoretical works have been developed to model the non - equilibrium process of condensate formation itself .",
    "pioneering works , such as of refs .",
    "@xcite , pointed primarily on the different dynamical stages of condensate formation in terms of kinetic growth equations , and numerous efforts have led to highly accurate predictions for the time scale of condensate formation .",
    "less is known about the condensate particle number _",
    "distribution s dynamics _ in a dilute , weakly interacting bose gas consisting of a fixed number of @xmath0 particles .",
    "another question under current study  @xcite is whether the equilibrium steady state of a dilute bose - einstein condensate  which is finally reached only due to interatomic collisions , even in the case of very weak interactions  is unique , and characterized by thermodymanics and statistics of an ideal gas ? and ,",
    "how do quantum effects , such as number and energy fluctuations of the condensate and the non - condensate , which should become important especially for mesoscopic bose - einstein condensates , evolve during bose - einstein condensation and eventually drive the bose gas into the final gibbs - boltzmann equilibrium state ?    here , we present a quantum master equation theory for a dilute bose - einstein condensate consisting of a fixed number of @xmath0 particles .",
    "in contrast to previously derived effective equations for the condensate dynamics under the influence of the non - condensate environment , based for example on quantum kinetic theory @xcite or on an analogy with the laser master equation @xcite , our condensate master equation fully takes into account conservation of the total number of particles , i.e. of condensate plus non - condensate particles . in particular , the depletion of the non - condensate during the process of condensate formation results in condensate feeding and loss rates which are different from the case where the bose gas is coupled to an external particle reservoir with a fixed chemical potential .",
    "apart from particle number conservation , our approach relies on the separation of time scales between the condensate and non - condensate dynamics .",
    "the time scale @xmath1 for condensate growth  @xcite is typically of the order of @xmath2 s , and thus much slower than the timescale @xmath3 ms of two - body collisions within the non - condensate @xcite .",
    "we assume that these collisions lead to an effective thermalization of the non - condensate within each subspace of fixed non - condensate particle number , and to a rapid decay of non - condensate correlation functions with a rate @xmath4 . under these conditions",
    ", particle exchange between condensate and non - condensate leads to a markovian master equation for the condensate s particle number distribution .",
    "finally , we will show that its equilibrium steady state is given by a gibbs - boltzmann thermal state of non - interacting particles under the condition that the bose gas is sufficiently dilute , and that the decay of non - condensate correlations does not occur too fast , i.e. @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath8 the temperature of the gas ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the derivation of the quantum master equation is given in section  [ chapter_micro ] .",
    "first , we define the condensate and non - condensate hamiltonians , and decompose all two body interaction terms in a physically motivated way . using the assumptions mentioned above , we then derive the quantum master equation of lindblad type for the reduced condensate density matrix . for dilute atomic gases in three - dimensional harmonic trapping potentials , the lindblad master equation reduces to a simple rate equation for the condensate number distribution , describing transitions @xmath9 of the condensate particle number @xmath10 .    in sec .",
    "[ sectionv ] , the rate equation is used to study the dynamics of condensate formation , and its equilibrium steady state .",
    "we numerically monitor the condensate particle number distribution during bose - einstein condensation and extract time scales for condensate formation .",
    "the steady state solution of the rate equation finally yields a unique equilibrium steady state obeying detailed balance particle flow between condensate and non - condensate . in the case of weak interactions and under the condition @xmath5 of not too rapidly decaying non - condensate correlation functions",
    ", the steady state turns into a gibbs - boltzmann thermal state of a canonical ensemble of @xmath0 indistinguishable , non - interacting bosonic particles .",
