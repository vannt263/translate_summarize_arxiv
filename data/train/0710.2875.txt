    "many redox reaction in chemistry and biology involve bound states which are weaker than common chemical bonds , but stronger than intermolecular interactions in bulk molecular liquids .",
    "a prominent example of such association is binding of water molecules to solutes via hydrogen bonds .",
    "since the strength of such bonds typically varies between different electronic states of the solute , water association can be recorded by optical solvatochromism.@xcite another example is the one of proton equilibria involved in biological electron transfer ( et ) reactions responsible for photosynthesis and respiration.@xcite in photosystem ii , the primary donor p@xmath0 is oxidized by tyrosine which changes its pk@xmath1-value from 10 to @xmath2 upon oxidation . as a result , it can not hold onto its phenolic proton in aqueous solution releasing it in what is argued to be a concerted electron - proton transfer mechanism.@xcite another related example is photoacidity when photoexcited intramolecular charge transfer lowers pk@xmath1 for the release of a proton to the solvent.@xcite in view of the wide spread of such reactions , often referred to as proton - coupled et,@xcite in biological systems in general and enzymetic reactions in particular,@xcite one wonders if their occurrence is just a coincidence caused by ubiquity of acid - base equilibria in proteins , or , alternatively , protonation / deprotonation transitions are used by nature to fine - tune the et energetics .",
    "this question , also used for the paper title , is the subject of this study .",
    "it has been argued that coupling of et to the change in protonation alters the reaction free energy , often turning uphill reactions along the et coordinate into downhill reactions along a combined electron - proton reaction path.@xcite in order to make this argument more qualitative , at least one more parameter , the reorganization energy , needs to be specified.@xcite the picture of crossing parabolas used to calculate barriers of charge - transfer reactions@xcite involves in fact three components : the reaction free energy @xmath3 representing the vertical shift of the minima , the curvature @xmath4 given in terms of the reorganization energy @xmath5 , and the horizontal shift of the parabolas minima responsible for the stokes shift , @xmath6 ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .    , the free energy curvature @xmath4 , and the stokes shift ( separation between the minima @xmath7 ) .",
    "the reaction coordinate @xmath8 is the energy separation between the donor and acceptor electronic states .",
    "the activated state is given by the resonance of the donor and acceptor levels , @xmath9 , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 indicate the positions of the minima .",
    ", width=245 ]    the reaction coordinate @xmath8 , used to monitor the progress of a charge - transfer reaction , is the instantaneous energy gap between the donor and acceptor electronic energy levels.@xcite the vertical axis in figure [ fig:1 ] refers to _ free energies _ @xmath12 as functions of _ energy _",
    "they cross at zero energy gap @xmath9 allowing electronic tunneling ( @xmath13 refer to reactants and products , respectively ) . in fact , the marcus - hush description of et@xcite imposes one more additional constraint requiring the stokes shift to be identically equal to @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , only two parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , are required to determine the activation barrier .",
    "the strong link between the stokes shift and the reorganization energy is a consequence of the gaussian statistics of @xmath8 .",
    "once the statistics become non - gaussian , the free energy surfaces @xmath12 are non - parabolic and eq [ eq:0 ] does not hold.@xcite here , we propose a simple model for a charge - transfer reactions triggering the change in the state of binding of some particle dissolved in the solvent . in this development",
    ", we are less concerned with the details of a particular binding mechanisms , but more interested in addressing a more general question of whether the involvement of bound states can potentially provide a new mechanism of tuning the energetics of et not incorporated in the picture of crossing parabolas .",
    "we find that the statistics of fluctuations of the donor - acceptor energy gap , induced by local binding / unbinding events , are non - gaussian thus violating the link between the stokes shift and reorganization energy given by eq [ eq:0 ] .",
    "the main consequence of this result is more flexibility , compared to the standard picture , in tuning the energetics of et .",
    "we will consider a somewhat simplified situation in which the bound state is fully thermalized on the time - scale of et i.e.  on the time @xmath17 required for the system to climb the top of the potential barrier from the equilibrium bottom of the free energy surface ( @xmath18 is the et rate constant ) .",
    "this assumption implies that populations of bound and unbound states follow boltzmann statistics along the et reaction coordinate , a situation similar to the treatment of intramolecular vibrations in sumi - marcus model.@xcite this condition can be achieved when the rate of release of the binding particle b , @xmath19 , is much higher that the rate of et @xmath20    when this requirement is satisfied , one can use statistical mechanics to construct a one - dimensional free - energy surface for the et reaction in which the exchange between localized and delocalized states of the binding particle produce fluctuations of the donor - acceptor energy gap , just as any other solvent mode interacting with the transferred electron.@xcite    . the equilibrium population of the bound state assumes that the unbinding rate is much faster than the rate of et ( @xmath21 ) ; @xmath22 denotes the change in the binding energy caused by the electronic transition .",
    ", width=264 ]    the release of one particle from the bound localized state requires the gibbs energy @xmath23 balancing the binding energy @xmath24 with an entropy gain from moving the particle into the bulk .",
    "the binding energy @xmath24 is generally different in the initial , d  a ( @xmath25 ) , and final , d@xmath26a@xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , configurations of the donor - acceptor complex ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the difference in free energies needed to release particle b to the solution is equal to the difference in binding energies , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , this quantity can be estimated from the difference of the equilibrium dissociation constants pk@xmath30 : @xmath31    the requirement of non - adiabaticity of et , which we implicitly assume here , imposes an additional constraint on the rate of bound particle release .",
    "the change of the donor and acceptor energy levels caused by the motion of the bound particle should not break the landau - zener non - adiabaticity condition close to donor - acceptor energy resonance : @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the donor - acceptor electronic coupling . assuming the rate of binding energy change as @xmath34 and @xmath33 of the order of 1 @xmath35 , eq [ eq:3 ] requires the rate of release of b to be faster than 1 ns@xmath36 .",
    "this threshold rate is comparable to the rate of proton release from bound protonation states of proteins,@xcite while the time of water exchange between the protein surface and the bulk is faster , in the range of tens of picoseconds.@xcite    once particle b is released from its bound state , it becomes a part of the bulk , which is the aqueous solution or a solvent mixture for water binding or the ionic atmosphere for ionic ( proton ) association .",
    "the interaction of the bulk with electronic states of the donor and acceptor is relatively well understood . for water",
    "binding , fluctuations of the dipolar polarization produce the thermal noise . for electrolytes ,",
    "the debye - hckel electric field both shifts the donor - acceptor energy gap and creates its fluctuations thus producing a corresponding reorganization energy.@xcite this ionic reorganization energy @xmath37 scales quadratically with the inverse debye - hckel length @xmath38 and linearly with a solute dimension @xmath39 . since it is also inversely proportional to the static dielectric constant of the solvent @xmath40 , the effect of fluctuations of the ionic atmosphere in polar solvents is commonly small relative to the reorganization energy of polarization fluctuations .",
    "we will therefore assume that once particle b is released from its bound state , it does not interact any more with the transferred electron and becomes a part of the many - particle electrostatic potential .",
    "this approximation allows us to apply the tight - binding approximation and to use the following expression for the hamiltonian of the donor - acceptor system in a polar solvent @xmath41 here , @xmath42 incorporates the vacuum energy and the free energy of solvation by the electronic degrees of freedom of the solvent and @xmath43 denotes the vacuum electric field of the donor - acceptor complex in two et states ( @xmath13 ) and two binding states ( u , b ) . also , @xmath44 and @xmath45 in eq [ eq:4 ] describe the population operators for the bound ( b ) and unbound ( u ) states of particle b with the binding energy @xmath24 .",
    "one can expect only a small change in the electric field of the donor - acceptor complex for weak binding of a neutral molecule , @xmath46 .",
    "however , the dependence of the electric field on the binding state needs to be incorporated for equilibria of charged particles .    in application to protonation / deprotonation equilibria , the hamiltonian considered here ( eq [ eq:4 ] ) is different from the ones used by cukier@xcite and soudackov and hammes - schiffer.@xcite in their case , the proton was considered to move between two localized states within the donor - acceptor complex , while in the problem considered here the proton is released to the bulk and loses any connection to electronic transitions within the donor - acceptor pair except for the influence of the debye - hckel field it becomes a part of .",
    "the different physics of the problem considered here demands the different hamiltonian .",
    "the electric field interacts with the ( nuclear ) dipolar polarization of the solvent @xmath47 , and the asterisk in eq [ eq:4 ] implies both the tensor contraction and the volume integration .",
    "the statistics of @xmath47 are gaussian with the response function @xmath48 such that the solvent reorganization energy is @xmath49 although @xmath50 in eq [ eq:5 ] are formally the reorganization energies of the dipolar polarization field of the solvent , we will attach a more general meaning to them as the reorganization energies of the nuclear degrees of freedom of the bulk .",
    "the corresponding formal definition is easy to obtain from eq [ eq:4 ] by replacing the gaussian polarization noise with a sum of statistically independent gaussian fields .",

    "a more quantitative analysis would require extensive calculations . since the model presented here does not aim at a detailed quantitative analysis of proton - coupled et , we limit our discussion to qualitative observations only .",
    "traditional theories of et in polar liquids emphasize activation of electronic transitions by long - range , quasi - macroscopic solvent fluctuations.@xcite local binding to the donor and acceptor sites provides an additional modulation of the donor - acceptor energy gap .",
    "this study addressed the question of whether this additional thermal noise can be accounted for within the standard framework of gaussian fluctuations of the energy gap , that is by adjusting the magnitudes of the driving force and reorganization energy .",
    "we have found that the statistics of binding events are non - gaussian , and the resultant free energy surfaces can not be reduced to crossing parabolas .",
    "the model predicts a regime of a significant dependence of the activation barrier on the concentration of the binding particles in the solution . when the concentration pb is close to the binding equilibrium constant pk@xmath1 , the variance of the energy gap passes through a maximum which can be observed by spectroscopy of charge - transfer bands . despite these new features ,",
    "the main effect of binding is in shifting the free energy gap of et , as was suggested previously,@xcite leaving the reorganization energy mostly unaffected and within the realm of standard models .",
    "finally , the model helps to rationalize some recent observations of the dependence of rates of intramolecular et , involving deprotonation of reactants , on the ph of the solution ."
