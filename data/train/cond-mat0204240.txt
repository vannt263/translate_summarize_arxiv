    "the problem of the theoretical description for the many - boson system thermodynamics in a wide temperature range is a very curious one and still remains unsolved .",
    "liquid 4 is the best example for the theretical studies because of its anomalous low - temperature behaviour .",
    "it is well - known how to obtain the thermodynamic functions in the limit @xmath4 ( this is given by the theory of bogoliubov  @xcite ) .",
    "the renormalization group theory also gives a fairly well results at the point of the lambda - transition  @xcite .",
    "but still , quite a large temperature range might be studied by means of numerical computations only .",
    "sears  @xcite utilized neutron scattering results in order to determine the internal energy of liquid helium-4 via some simple thermodynamic relations . for these calculations ,",
    "the potential of aziz _ et al _  @xcite was used for representing the he  he interatomic interaction .",
    "path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique which allows for the study of the physical quntities temperature dependences was utilized by ceperley and pollock  @xcite for the helium-4 thermodynamic properties calculation at the temperatures above 1  k. kinetic energy of liquid and solid helium-4 was calculated in  @xcite at high temperatures .",
    "such numerical simulations are numerous and we do not intend to analize them here .",
    "the overview of path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) techniques application in the theory of condensed helium is adduced in the paper by ceperley  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the analytical relations for the thermodynamic properties was made by vakarchuk  @xcite . in the first of the cited works ,",
    "the expression for the many - boson two - particle density matrix was written .",
    "the second work contains the analysis of the non - linear density fluctuations contribution into the thermodynamic properties of the bose - system .",
    "the expressions found there are expected to provide a good description in a wide temperature range .    in this work",
    ", we will proceed from a very well studied random phase approximation ( rpa ) which allows one to receive a low - temperature asymptotics for the thermodynamic and structure functions of liquid 4 . then , making some quite natural assumptions , we will develop what might be called ` effective post - rpa ' since the post - rpa corrections will be taken into account in an effective manner . in principle , such a technique will move us substantially ahead form the low - temperature region .",
    "but unfortunately the way of the equations solution applied here does not allows to grasp the temperatures @xmath5 where @xmath2 stands for the lambda - transition point , this seems to be rather a technical problem .    in this paper",
    ", we use the previously obtained potential  @xcite for the calculation of thermodynamic properties of liquid helium .",
    "a two - time temperature green function technique will be utilized for the calculation of the energy and specific heat .",
    "the application of this technique is well - known , it was used by tserkovnikov  @xcite for the non - ideal bose - gas in the random phase approximation .",
    "additionally , this method leads to a quite short way to the rpa ( bogoliubov s ) results . unlike what is usualy done ,",
    "the collective variables being the density fluctuations fourier components are utilized for constructing the green functions instead of the creation ",
    "annihilation operators .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we introduce the operators for the green functions and write the hamiltonian . in section  iii , the equations of motion are written and solved .",
    "next , the function @xmath6 for the accounting of post - rpa terms is introduced .",

    "it is interesting as well to consider the @xmath16-representation for @xmath14 . neglecting terms with two sums over the wave vector ( i.  e. , leaving the rpa term only ) we obtain [ krhodef ] k_=_0\\ { 12_- _ -14_k_- _ }",
    ", @xmath18 is the energy of a free particle : _",
    "k=^2 k^2 2 m .",
    "since the total energy of the system @xmath19 is the average value of the hamiltonian we need to know the way of averaging our expressions . in order to find the average values of such expressions as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc .",

    "the expression @xmath49 obviously equals to zero but we reserve it in the sence of the limit @xmath50 , this will be necessary for the ideal gas case . therefore , [ gamma0 ] _ 0=ts_0(t)-_0-_0=1_t-_0-_0 , where the connection between structure factor at @xmath51 and the isothermic compressibility @xmath52 is taken into account . for the ideal gas @xmath53 ,",

    "one should notice that teh correct results must be expected only for the temperatures at which it is possible to neglect the higher - order terms in the equation for @xmath44 ( [ uptogamma2 ] ) .",
    "in other words , if @xmath74 then the results are not correct .",
    "taking into account that the typical wave vector absolute value for 4 is 2    ( it corresponds to the first maximum on the structure factor curve ) we obtain the upper limit for the applicability of our results as @xmath75 .      in this case",
    "one can use the techniques similar to the described in the previous sections for low temperatures .",

    "therefore , for the simplification of the calculations we decided to substitute @xmath6 with @xmath78 , see ( [ gammahigh ] ) , where @xmath34 is the kinetic energy per particle .    we have rewritten the expression for the free energy ( [ freeengamma ] ) in order to obtain the equation for @xmath79 : k & = & 14 ^ 2 _",
