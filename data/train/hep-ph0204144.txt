    "the @xmath2 experimental signal arises from the majorana nature of massive @xmath3 . even though the experiment by itself does not necessarily require a supersymmetric framework for its explanation , the indication towards a majorana spacetime structure suddenly acquires a pivotal importance .    in this _",
    "letter _ we , therefore , undertake an _ ab initio _ look at the spacetime structure of the massive majorana particles  whether they be neutrinos or gaugions .",

    ", we show the insensitivity of majorana self / antiself conjugate spinors to the arrow of time .",
    "the explicit construct of the particle - antiparticle metamorphosis is presented in sec . 6 in terms of the momentum - space feynman propagator .",
    "the _ letter _ closes with some brief remarks and a summary .",
    "as already noted , in the simplest scenario , the recent results of klapdor - kleingrothaus _ et al . _",
    "are interpreted as arising from the majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "the essential physics of interest lies in the following . a virtual @xmath6 , which induces a weak @xmath7 transition , decays into @xmath8 and @xmath9 , w^- e^- + _ e , [ w1 ] and the emitted @xmath9 is reabsorbed as an @xmath3 , _ e + w^- e^-[w2 ] , where the second ( virtual ) @xmath6 takes responsibility for the second @xmath7 transformation .",
    "the net result is the @xmath2 , a(n , z ) a(n-2,z+2 ) + 2 e^- , where @xmath10 represents a nucleus carrying @xmath11 neutrons , and @xmath12 protons .",
    "now , the majorana nature of @xmath3 does not mean ( @xmath13 ) that one can naively identify the @xmath9 of ( [ w1 ] ) with the @xmath3 of ( [ w2 ] ) , : _ e=_e .",
    "this is so because a neutrino carries a negative helicity in the @xmath14 limit , and transforms as a @xmath15 object ; while an antineutrino carries a positive helicity in the @xmath14 limit , and transforms as a @xmath16 object . as such",
    "there is a @xmath17 suppressed amplitude for the above identification @xcite .",
    "this result arises in a framework in which the majorana field @xcite is obtained from the dirac field , ( x ) = _ h= , , [ majorana ] through the identification , b^_h()= a^_h(),[fock ] where @xmath18 is a `` creation phase factor '' @xcite",
    ".    as is apparent , the above fock space construct ceases to place fundamentally _ neutral _ fields at the same footing as the intrinsically _ charged _ fields .",
    "instead , it patches together the old dirac spacetime structure of the @xmath19 representation space , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with a new fock - space constraint as suggested by majorana ( [ fock ] ) .",
    "in other words , the fock space is treated correctly , via eq .",
    "( [ fock ] ) , as is required for a fundamentally neutral field .",
    "however , the underlying representation space is still obliged to the dirac spinors .",
    "the majorana construct , as used by the high - energy physics community , is a _ hybrid _ and it asks for the formulation of a framework that is of majorana type both in spinor- and fock- spaces .",
    "the question now is , whether it is possible to create a fully symmetric framework for the intrinsically neutral fields that carries an explicit counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ fock ] ) for its @xmath19 spinorial structure . in this _",
