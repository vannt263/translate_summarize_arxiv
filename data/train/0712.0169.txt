    "evaporative contact line deposition , also known as the coffee - drop effect , has been the subject of several recent papers @xcite .",
    "the physical problem originates from a simple phenomenon of everyday life : when a drop containing a solute such as coffee dries on a surface , the solute is driven to the contact line and forms a characteristic ring pattern .",
    "the basic mechanism behind the phenomenon is now well understood @xcite : the drying drop is pinned at the contact line so that there must be an outward capillary flow to replace the liquid evaporating at the edge , and this flow carries solute particles to the contact line where the deposit is formed .",
    "this simple phenomenon is important in many scientific and industrial applications @xcite .",
    "the evaporation mechanism can create very fine lines of deposit in a robust way that requires no explicit forming .",
    "it can be used to concentrate material strongly in a controllable way .",
    "it also creates capillary flow patterns which are useful for processing polyatomic solutes like dna @xcite .    the deposition process and",
    "the resulting patterns are affected by various physical and chemical conditions .",
    "the wetting property of the substrate and surface roughness affect the geometry of an evaporating drop @xcite .",
    "also , within the drop there can be a convective flow induced by gradient in temperature , surfactant concentration , or surface tension @xcite , and it can lead to very complicated , even fractal - like , deposit patterns .",
    "furthermore , some mechanisms , such as contact line depinning @xcite , are still not clear , and there are no satisfactory explanations for multiple - ring deposit patterns @xcite .",
    "several models have been established under the common assumptions of slow evaporation and creeping flow so that quasi - equilibrium dynamics is warranted : the dynamics is determined by the time evolution of the equilibrium properties of the evaporating system .",
    "these models use different conditions and assumptions on such properties as geometry , evaporation profile , and deposition criteria .",
    "in addition to circular thin drop , there have been studies on contact line deposition in an angular region @xcite , where the nontrivial geometry at the tip of the angle induces a crossover in deposit properties . both uniform evaporation flux and diffusion - controlled flux , which diverges at the contact line ,",
    "are considered , and they yield different deposit density profiles and growth properties along the contact line in this asymmetric geometry .    in a circular - symmetric geometry , such as a circular evaporating drop , the deposit along the contact line is always uniform .",
    "it is thus more important to understand in this case the spatial deposit profile and growth dynamics in a dimension perpendicular to the contact line , that is , how the solute particles form the deposit and accumulate toward the center of the drop from the contact line .",
    "dupont @xcite suggested there be a maximal volume concentration @xmath2 for solute particles such that once the concentration increases to @xmath2 , the horizontal transport of solute particles stops , and those particles form the deposit .",
    "following dupont s deposition criterion , popov @xcite studied a model with a pinned round evaporating thin drop and diffusion - controlled evaporation flux .",
    "there are two regions in his model : a deposition region , where the solute concentration is @xmath2 ; a transport region , where the solute concentration is smaller than @xmath2 and horizontal solute transport is allowed .",
    "popov assumed that the deposition near the contact line affects the geometry of the drop and the evaporation - induced flow field ( fig 1.2a ) . as a result",
    ", popov s model is characterized by several variables described by a system of coupled differential equations , of which a complete solution is not available .",
    "[ ptb ]    two_models_f.eps    in popov s picture , the deposit thickness increases monotonically toward the center of the drop until an abrupt vertical wall is formed at the end of the total drying time .",
    "the scale of the thickness is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the concentration ratio defined as the initial uniform volume concentration @xmath5 divided by @xmath2 .",
    "this @xmath3-dependence near the contact line had been known before @xcite and is understandable heuristically .",
    "the volume of the deposit , which is proportional to the square of the thickness , multiplied by the concentration @xmath6 , must give the total solute mass in the deposit that is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "however , as this dependence is largely asymptotic toward the contact line , where the time dependence is suppressed and the hydrodynamics and the deposition dynamics are largely separated , popov s coupled system may not be necessary to derive this result .",
    "moreover , the complexity in popov s mathematical formulations may inadvertently obscure the simple and fundamental underlying physical process .",
    "moreover , a realistic deposit clearly follows a rich profile that shows different scaling properties in different regions .",
    "thus to interpret the deposit properties within a single asymptotic regime and with a unique @xmath3 is not satisfactory .    following the truncated transport dynamics and the simpler assumptions that the hydrodynamics and the deposition process are fully separable , dupont @xcite showed by direct numerical simulation a ring - like deposit pattern with variance in areal density along the radial direction ( fig .",
    "[ spot ] and fig .",
    "[ profile ] ) .",
    "the simple mechanism thus produces a realistic deposit pattern with a pronounced maximal density near the contact line .",
    "in particular , the areal density shows a potentially analyzable characteristic profile that manifests multiple asymptotic regimes , and that could reveal robust properties of contact line deposition under general conditions .",
    "[ ptb ]    spot_f.eps    [ ptb ]    in this work we re - visit dupont s criterion with minimal restrictions and simpler assumptions .",
    "we consider a pinned circular thin drop . in particular , we assume that the deposition process does not interfere with the hydrodynamics such as the drop geometry and flow velocity field .",
    "we consider both the uniform evaporation and the diffusion - controlled evaporation conditions , to be defined below . to interpret the deposit density , we assume that the solute particles in the deposition region , where horizontal transport is stopped , can still move vertically so that the thickness of the deposit is determined by the geometry of the drop and changes with time",
    ". the final deposit profile is thus described by its areal density when the drop dries up and the thickness becomes zero throughout the drop ( fig .",
    "1.2b ) . to interpret the final deposit in terms of the areal density profile is not essential to the model , however , as we shall discuss later that the model is also valid for a deposit with finite thickness as long as the deposition does not interfere with the hydrodynamics of the evaporating drop .",
    "we thus want to follow a reductive approach as we believe that the fundamental and robust physical properties underlying complex phenomena should be captured by a simple mathematical structure with minimal restrictions . by this approach ,",
    "we want to achieve two goals .",
    "first , instead of being exhaustive in considering all the possible conditions , we want to understand the robustness of the model : among the various factors that characterize the problem what are most important in determining the key deposition properties and in yielding physically feasible and realistic deposit patterns .",
    "second , what is the appropriate mathematical structure to describe those dominant factors , and can this mathematical structure be generalized to other physical systems .    in the rest of the work we first establish in section 2 a one - dimensional simplification of the deposition process that we denote as pipe models .",
    "these models capture the important characteristics of the truncated transport dynamics .",
    "we then review the major results of the hydrodynamic properties of an evaporating drop and apply the pipe models to the evaporative deposition process with uniform evaporation in section 3 . in section 4 , we solve for the areal density profile and identify the scaling laws in different asymptotic regimes .",
    "we consider in section 5 the deposition properties with the diffusion - controlled evaporation . in section 6",
    ", we compare our findings with popov s , extending our results to interpreting the deposit in terms of the thickness profile .",
    "we then make a few comments on depinning and formation of multiple - ring patterns within the truncated transport dynamics scheme in section 7 .",
    "we discuss experimental issues and possible generalizations of the model in section 8 , and present the conclusion in section 9 . in addition , we provide an alternative derivation of the equation of motion for the shock front in appendix .",
    "the transport process , truncated by the maximal concentration @xmath2 , is naturally divided into two regions : a transport region where the concentration is smaller than @xmath2 , and a deposition region where there is no horizontal transport of solute particles .",
    "solute mass is carried from the transport region to the deposition region , and the growth of the deposit is described by a characteristic moving front that separates the two regions .    we establish in this section the so - called pipe models  to formalize the truncated dynamics under different conditions .",
    "although some predictions made by these models depend on pipe specifications , we find that certain important properties , such as the shock front velocity , are actually model - independent and thus generalizable .",
    "we shall show later how these universal properties may help explain the observed robustness in the general deposition phenomena .    to simplify mathematical formulations , in the following models we only treat one - dimensional case , or similarly radial symmetric case .",
    "however , we believe the key findings are readily applicable to higher dimensions .",
    "[ ptb ]    we consider a uniform pipe with simple properties ( fig .",
    "[ uniform pipeline ] ) : incoming solute particles with constant volume concentration @xmath5 are transported at a constant velocity @xmath7 to the end of the pipe where the carrier fluid exits the pipe but the solute particles remain to form a deposit .",
    "the solute particles stop moving when their concentration exceeds @xmath2 , which therefore is the volume concentration of the deposit . to focus on the horizontal transport properties , we ignore the variance in velocity along the cross section of the pipe .",
    "this simplification is compatible with the basic assumptions made for the evaporative deposition problem as we shall show in the next section .",
    "the configuration is thus divided into two regions : a transport region with concentration @xmath5 and a deposition region with concentration @xmath2 .",
    "the boundary that separates the two regions is characterized by its position @xmath8 .",
    "local conservation of solute mass at the boundary demands:@xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "several observations immediately follow from eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) .",
    "first , the boundary moves at a velocity proportional to the transport velocity @xmath7 , and the proportional coefficient is determined by the ratio of the two volumes concentrations .",
    "second , there must be a finite gap in volume concentration across the boundary , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 , otherwise the velocity @xmath12 would diverge , which is not physical .",
    "the moving boundary is therefore a shock front that represents a discontinuity in local volume concentration profile .",
    "it is worth noting that although the two - component simplified geometry with constant @xmath5 and @xmath2 in the first place warrants the discontinuity and leads to the shock front , the implications of eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) are more general . if the transport process is characterized by the truncation criterion and the two - component configuration and if the boundary that separates the two regions moves with a finite velocity , there gap in concentrations across the boundary must exist as we now show .      a typical evaporating drop that we consider has a circularly symmetric geometry and an outward flow field along the radial direction .",
    "to adapt to this specific geometry , in a more realistic pipe model ( fig .",
    "[ real pipeline ] ) we introduce @xmath13 as the pipe s height profile , where @xmath14 is the radial distance , and allow other characteristic quantities such as the maximal volume concentration @xmath2 and the transport velocity @xmath7 to vary both in @xmath14 and time @xmath15 . in addtion , to account for the circularly symmetric geometry , our pipe must have a cross section area that varies along the radial direction as @xmath16 .",
    "this manipulation with respect to the circularly symmetric geometry may seem greatly constraint the pipe models .",
    "however , we shall show below that the major predictions made from the pipe models are actually independent of the specific form of the cross section area as long as it does not introduce significant singularities .",
    "the term @xmath16 has been introduced only to conform with the drop geometry which is not really a pipe .",
    "[ ptb ]    realpipe_f.eps    we treat in the real pipe @xmath17 , @xmath2 , and @xmath7 as independent specified physical quantities that have independent dynamics .",
    "this is not necessarily true in real settings such as the evaporative deposition we shall consider later , but it will allow us to derive general results and will pose not difficulties to implementing these results to specific real situations where the dynamics may couple .",
    "there are perhaps some conceptual difficulties with the functional form @xmath18 .",
    "for example ,",
    "because it evolves in time , what if for a position in the deposition region the @xmath2 becomes smaller than the actual volume concentration in a later time ?",
    "we do not consider this special case as it does not occur in the evaporative deposition problem .",
    "nonetheless , it can be relevant in other systems with more complicated transport properties and is certainly an interesting problem for its own sake .",
    "we again impose the truncation condition that the horizontal transport of solute mass is truncated once the local volume concentration @xmath19 reaches @xmath18 .",
    "as in the uniform pipe model , we consider the position @xmath20 of the moving front that separates the deposition region and the transport region . to simplify mathematical analysis",

    ". we shall however discuss effects of discontinuities and other singularities later .    in the deposition region",

    "( [ d28 ] ) and ( [ b13 ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , our results clearly show two different asymptotic regimes and the thickness profile is instead proportional to @xmath230 ( uniform evaporation ) or @xmath280 ( diffusion - controlled evaporation ) in the late drying stage toward to center of the drop .",
    "neither the @xmath3-universality of the thickness profile near the contact line nor the power - law decay toward the center of the drop was apparent in popov s findings .",
    "the coupled system popov studied is thus fully reducible to the simpler conditions we have assumed in the small @xmath4 limit .",
    "this coupling between the deposition and the hydrodynamics is further resolved near the contact line in the limit @xmath183 ( this is consistent with the @xmath3-scaling property of @xmath305 ) .",
    "it is thus fairly reasonable to argue that the evaporative deposition phenomenon is robust against specific assumptions and conditions in this asymptotic regime .",
    "additionally as we have shown that the temporal properties of the process are actually @xmath306-independent , by assuming the decoupling we are able to specify a universal time scale when the maximal deposit thickness forms and to extend the truncated deposition model to a separate new asymptotic regime toward the center of the drop .",
    "furthermore , it is worth pointing out that even popov s treatment in @xcite only partly addresses the coupling between the formed deposit and hydrodynamics , and a few important dynamical aspects are still missing .",
    "first , the deposit - dependent drop shape alters the boundary conditions under which the evaporation flux is determined and hence further changes the velocity field .",
    "second , the velocity field in the deposition region should be certainly affected by the deposit .",
    "if the deposit takes up a nonzero fraction of the volume , a given evaporation flux will take the same amount of available solvent per unit time but with a larger effective volume in the deposition region , and a larger velocity is required to replenish this solvent . however , our findings suggest that by controlling the initial concentration ration @xmath4 all these couplings might be effectively suppressed near the contact line at the early drying stage and may not alter the deposition properties . also , further considerations of these couplings are important for experimentally testing the model",
    ". we shall discuss this issue later .",
    "in the evaporative deposition model , we have identified one key deposition mechanism : horizontal transport of solute particles truncated by maximal allowed volume concentration .",
    "this truncated dynamics is robust in the sense that it admits a solution with a moving shock front that has a definite functional form independent of the dynamical characteristics of the problem .",
    "the shock front velocity only depends on local values of the flow velocity , the pipe geometry , and the volume concentration in the transport region .",
    "furthermore , the truncated transport mechanism leads to a characteristic deposit profile near the contact line that is independent of evaporation conditions and dynamical couplings in the early drying stage .",
    "although practically evaporative deposition phenomena are rich and there must be many complex underlying mechanisms , we now discuss how the truncated transport dynamics , as a single deposition mechanism , might yield general deposit profiles under some typical and controllable conditions .      for an actual evaporative deposition process @xcite , in the late drying stage the contact line of a evaporating drop can depin and retreat toward the drop center before it is pinned again , and the deposition process is restored at the newly - formed contact line .",
    "the slip - stick process may occur many times before the drop tries up and thus yield a multiple - ring pattern @xcite .",
    "there is still no consensus on a general depinning mechanism , which may not exist after all .",
    "a conventional explanation @xcite calls for the young - dupre equation at the contact line @xcite : @xmath307 , where @xmath59 is the contact angle , and @xmath308 , @xmath309 , and @xmath310 are the surface tensions at liquid - vapor , solid - liquid , and vapor - solid interfaces . the horizontal component of the surface tension along the liquid - vapor interface at the contact line @xmath311 acts as the depinning force that increases as the drop progressively flattens toward the late drying stage .",
    "@xmath309 also contributes to the depinning force , but it primarily depends on the local deposition and is less affected by the geometry .",
    "admittedly this explanation can be problematic in that it predicts an extremely narrow range of deposit thickness and drop configurations when the maximal horizontal depinning force is achieved and the contact line depins .",
    "in reality , however , the depinning occurs over a wide range of configurations . to account for this smooth change ,",
    "the conventional explanation thus must be complemented by other mechanisms that are still lacking .",
    "we shall in the following consider within the framework of the conventional theory and cautiously keep its limitations in mind .",
    "the depinning phenomenon thus clearly involves the coupling between the deposition process and the hydrodynamics of the evaporating drop : the drop geometry and therefore the contact angle @xmath59 must be determined from the boundary conditions defined by the formed deposit pattern to account for the change of the depinning force ( fig .",
    "1.2a ) . to continue our discussion of depinning within the model established in the previous sections",
    ", we must adopt the view that our results based on the assumption of decoupling can be applied to the coupling system in the lowest order of @xmath4 , and we also must interpret the deposit pattern in terms of the thickness profile @xmath312 .",
    "deegan showed experimentally @xcite that the depinning time @xmath313 is about @xmath314 to @xmath315 ( in the unit that the total drying time @xmath316 ) and it depends on the initial volume concentration @xmath4 ( from @xmath317 to @xmath318 ) .",
    "we have found that in the small @xmath4 limit , the maximal areal density and hence the maximal deposit thickness occurs at time @xmath319 ( eq .",

    "( [ b15 ] ) ) for the diffusion - controlled evaporation .",
    "our @xmath179 thus falls in the range of the depinning time found in experiments .",
    "geometrically the maximal deposit thickness occurs when the contact angle @xmath59 at the rim of the deposit becomes zero and the depinning force @xmath311 achieves its maximal value .    to derive @xmath179 formally , we note that @xmath321 ( eq . ( [ d20 ] ) ) , and thus the condition @xmath322 demands@xmath323 eq .",

    "the depinning may occur once the contact angle is small enough but not necessarily zero , and as a result @xmath325 .",
    "may become negative when the drop is actually overhanging against the deposit rim . in this case @xmath326 , and the depinning process must be due to different mechanisms .",
    "] more importantly , our finding of @xmath179 , as opposed to deegan s results , does not depend on the initial concentration ( fig .",
    "[ scaling law_t ] ) when @xmath4 is small .",
    "this dependence may be included in the higher order solution in @xmath4 when the coupling between deposition and geometry is considered .",
    "the dependence can also reflect the dependence of @xmath309 on @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless our finding of @xmath179 within the truncated transport model is consistent with empirical evidence and may be instructive for further studies .    also , for the complicated depinning process the above explanation based on deegan s experimental results is not universal .",
    "other mechanisms , such as the tension within the formed deposit @xcite , the kinetic processes controlled by the viscous stress in the drop , or the diffusion relaxation in air , may affect the depinning under certain conditions and thus lead to different interpretation of the depinning time .",
    "the depinning process can lead to multiple - ring deposit patterns : the retreating contact line is rested at a nearer position toward the drop center and the deposition process continues at this newly formed contact line . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , a slip - stick theory was established , where the young - dupre condition was incorporated into the equation of motion for the contact line . as a result , the contact line was found to follow a sinusoidal motion , and this led to a very dense multiple - ring pattern .",
    "the authors in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite considered controllable multiple - ring formation in nonconventional geometries . some of these empirical evidence may need explanations that are different from deegan s framework @xcite .",
    "following our discussion on the depinning process , we consider an ideal model for the multiple - ring formation .",
    "for the diffusion - controlled evaporation , we identify the depinning time @xmath327 ( @xmath0 for the uniform evaporation ) , _ i.e. _ , the contact line is released when the contact angle becomes zero .",

    "the thickness is represented by the maximal thickness @xmath329 ( eq . ( [ d15 ] ) ) .",
    "the newly pinned position @xmath330 can be determined by considering the change of the solvent volume .",
    "initially for small contact angle @xmath92 , the total volume of the drop is @xmath331 we assume the contact line moves fast enough to the new position so that the time it takes can be ignored compare to the time when it is pinned . since the evaporation flux is stationary , the volume of the drop when the contact line is pinned again is thus @xmath332 ( @xmath333 for the uniform evaporation ) . for slow evaporation",
    ", the newly pinned drop must still maintain a spherical cap geometry .",
    "the contact angle at the new contact line must still be approximately @xmath92 since it is determined by the young - dupre condition .",
    "thus we find@xmath334 and @xmath335 for the uniform evaporation .",
    "we next consider the width and the thickness of the new deposit ring .",
    "the deposition process via truncated transport is restored at the newly formed contact line , and the deposit growth there must follow what we have found at the initial contact line . since @xmath336 ( eq . ( [ d14 ] ) ) and @xmath337 ( eq . ( [ d15 ] ) )",
    "( we now have added @xmath82 to the dimensionless expressions ) , for the new ring we replace @xmath82 with @xmath330 and replace @xmath4 with concentration ratio at the new contact line : @xmath338 in the case of the diffusion - controlled evaporation profile ( eq .",

    "empirically deposit patterns with major multiple rings were observed by deegan @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ deegan ] , for two initial concentrations ( a ) 0.01 and ( d ) 0.00063 there are major higher - order rings up to the third order with width and thickness comparable to the zeroth order ring at the initial contact line .",
    "our above analysis in the highly ideal case is at least consistent with the observed pictures .",
    "for the other two initial concentrations ( cases ( b ) and ( c ) ) , however , major higher - order rings are not observed .",
    "[ ptb ]    between the major rings deegan s results clearly show some fine complex patterns . in our ideal case , these fine patterns are formed by the solute particles in the region where the depinned contact line sweeps through between two pinning events .",
    "thus they must be formed within a much smaller time scale compared to the major ring formation according to our assumptions .",
    "formation of those fine structures , as a result , may not be explained within the framework of the truncated transport dynamics considered in this work .",
    "instead , other mechanisms , such as the dynamics and instabilities of the dewetting of thin films @xcite where capillary forces are important and long - range interactions between solute particles are relevant @xcite , are needed to account for the observed patterns in those regimes .",
    "experimental tests involve two aspects of the model .",
    "first , dupont model is based on some assumptions and conditions that require specific experimental design and realization .",
    "second , testability depends on the major predictions made by the model .",
    "we shall discuss these in turn .",
    "the decoupling between the deposition process and the transport process is the major assumption .",
    "this ideal case can be approximated under certain experimental conditions .",
    "one of the key parameters in dupont model is the allowed maximal concentration @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 should depend on the size of the solute particles , interactions between the solute , the solvent , and the substrate .",
    "@xmath2 could be also affected by other dynamic factors , such as the flow velocity .",
    "empirical data for @xmath2 is limited , but naively @xmath2 can be deduced from the initial volume concentration by measuring the volume of the major deposit rings and comparing it with the initial volume of the entire drop .",
    "the assumption of decoupling requires @xmath6 be small .",
    "any solid particles must become immobilized if their concentration is high enough . for simply shaped particles ,",
    "the immobilization occurs at volume fractions of order unity",
    ". however , the immobilizing volume fraction can be much smaller than unity if the solute consists of tenuous objects like polymers , especially those that form a physical gel @xcite .",
    "many organic solutes such as food may well be of this sort , and seem most appropriate for the model .",
    "another aspect of the coupling is that the formed deposit may alter the drop geometry which in turn changes the evaporation flux and its generated flow field .",
    "one way to bypass this obstacle is to realize the uniform evaporation profile as sketched in @xcite .",
    "the uniform evaporation , unlike the diffusion - controlled case , is maintained by the peripheral environment but not the drop itself .",
    "the coupling due to change of the evaporation condition is thus effectively avoided .",
    "furthermore , some kinetic effects such as marangoni flows and viscous stress may deviate from the dupont model assumptions and the fundamental lubrication approximation .",
    "convective marangoni flows can be avoided by maintaining uniform experimental conditions such as the temperature and by reducing the thermal effect due to evaporation .",
    "viscous stress effect can be also reduced by slowing the evaporation .",
    "thus by making the environment nearly saturated with the solvent vapor , these kinetic effects can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "our work allows one to compare the predictions of the dupont model with experiment quantitatively in several new ways .",
    "our main prediction is about the normal density profile .",
    "there are three aspects that might be tested : the leading edge , the time and position of the maximal deposition , and the trailing edge .",
    "the leading edge prediction states that the areal density should increase linearly with distance from the contact line , and that the slope is proportional to the square root of the initial concentration ratio .",
    "this prediction is identical to popov s results and is therefore not a particular test of dupont model .",
    "the maximal deposition time , on the other hand , is a strong test and comes out very clearly from our findings .",
    "the power - law decay of the areal density at the trailing edge is also a strong test . on the qualitative level",
    ", this decay appears consistent with some experiments but not others .",
    "often with colloidal solutes , such as in some of deegan s experiments , one sees a sharp inner edge with no apparent decay at all .",
    "this is not a surprise . as noted above",
    ", dupont model is not completely applicable with compact solid solutes .",
    "moreover , a continuum model such as dupont s should not work completely when the solute particles have a size comparable to the drop thickness @xmath17.for non - colloidal solutes , there should be a decay that is consistent with our predictions for @xmath6 small enough .    for quantitative prediction , one should measure the density or thickness of the deposit as a function of distance as well as drying time .",
    "the function of distance can be straightforwardly measured for the dried deposit .",
    "the function of drying time can be measured by monitoring and recording the whole drying process .",
    "the shock front velocity might be also measured this way .",
    "we have not considered any kinetic effects such as visous stress and diffusion in the work .",
    "these effects will modify the physical assumptions and mathematical formulations .",
    "for example , we implement a step function to model the deposition condition with respect to the threshold concentration @xmath6 .",
    "horizontal diffusion and forces between various media may smooth the transition to immobility .",
    "mathematically this effect can be modelled by replacing the step function with a weakly convergent series , and the truncated transport equation thus becomes nonsingular .",
    "this is an interesting mathematical problem .",
    "physically we want to point out that the smooth effect is not as necessary as it might seem .",
    "when @xmath4 is small , the concentration in the transport region rises so fast toward the contact line that the transitional region with partial mobility would be very small .",
    "we already suggested that the power - law decay ( eqs .",
    "( [ d28 ] ) and ( [ b13 ] ) ) of the trailing edge could be independent of specific assumptions and derivation , and may actually reveal general properties of the evaporative deposition without depinning . to be more specific ,",
    "as already partly discussed in the previous work @xcite asymptotic properties , such as the power - law decay , might be robust against a broad range of specific dynamic processes , but are instead dependent on the singularities that characterize the dynamic conditions .",
    "in the case of the evaporative deposition , there are two sources of singularities encountered : the vanishing of the drop height and the divergence of the diffusion - controlled evaporation profile .",
    "both occur at the contact line .",
    "the exponent of -7 in the power - law decay of the density profile might be uniquely determined by these two singularities .",
    "this thought may prompt further studies of the robustness of the power - law against the drop geometry and other singular conditions .",
    "for instance , an evaporating drop pinned in an angular region studied in @xcite has a singular geometry profile at the contact line dependent on the contact line distance from the vertex of the angle as well as the opening angle of the region .",
    "an exact relation between the decay exponent and the characteristic singularities would give a decaying profile that continuously varies along the contact line and is controllable by the opening angle .",
    "more detailed asymptotic analysis is needed toward this goal .",
    "although in this work the simple geometry ( spherical cap ) and the regular evaporation profiles ( uniform or diffusion - controlled ) yield consistent and rich deposition phenomena , controllable nonconventional geometry and evaporation ( and so is the flow velocity field ) are important for creating complex deposit patterns @xcite .",
    "rigorous theoretical studies on these patterns are challenging .",
    "for example as pointed out by popov @xcite , determining the evaporation profile with nonconventional boundary geometry is one of the major obstacles for rigorously solving the deposition problem .",
    "furthermore , some drop configurations and velocity field , such as the negative contact angle , might lead to the formation of higher - order deposit rings even before depinning happens .",
    "the pipe models we have established in this work capture the basic characteristics of the truncated transport dynamics .",
    "it is robust in the sense that it admits a moving shock front , of which the equation motion only depends on local characteristic quantities in a definite functional form . besides the evaporative deposition problem",
    ", pipe models may be relevant to other systems with similar properties , such as the jamming in granular flow @xcite .",
    "further studies are needed to adapt the pipe models to such systems .",
    "in addition , some aspects of the pipe models may invite further attention .",
    "for example , to understand the behaviors of the shock front at singularities of a pipe and to characterize and utilize such behaviors require our further efforts .",
    "we have only considered in this work the singularity associated with the vanishing height of the pipe ( eq .",
    "( [ p17 ] ) ) , and in the application to the evaporative deposition problem this singularity corresponds to the contact line and amounts to the condition of self - consistency ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "however , the formulation eq .",
    "( [ p17 ] ) is far more general than the application . unlike the case of evaporative thin drops",
    "where the height profile and the flow velocity field are coupled due to the mass conservation of the solvent , in our derivation of the pipe models , the height profile and the flow velocity field are allowed to have independent dynamics .",
    "thus the singularities can rise either dynamically as those characteristic quantities evolve or statically in a controllable way . how to describe the shock front with dynamical singularities is an interesting but challenging problem .",
    "we have studied in this work a highly idealized evaporative deposition model in which different dynamics is fully separatable . in addition , the model is scalable in the sense that the length scale , defined in terms of the initial drop radius , and the time scale , defined in terms of the total drying time , are irrelevant in model characteristics . yet",
    "this model has yielded rich and solvable deposition properties that are consistent with empirical evidence .    in retrospection",
    ", we have so far fairly successfully addressed the two goals suggested in the introduction section .",
    "the first goal is to break the problem down and to prioritize different components .",
    "we divide the contact line deposition problem into two parts : phenomenology and mechanism .",
    "the former includes various conditions such as evaporation profiles , capillary - dominant equilibrium drop shape , and flow velocity field . for the latter part , among all the complexities we have identified and focused on the truncated transport dynamics as the unique deposition mechanism .",
    "our findings suggest that this unique mechanism is effective and robust for a fairly wide range of phenomenologies to produce consistent deposit patterns .",
    "our analysis has revealed a few asymptotic regimes with different characteristic scales in space and time .",
    "these regimes are largely determined by the phenomenologies but not the mechanism .",
    "the truncated transport dynamics is applicable to some of the regimes , and asymptotic deposit properties and scaling laws are identified .",
    "but some other important regimes may only be addressable by other mechanisms that go beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the second goal is to find the appropriate mathematical structure , which is largely determined by the mechanism .",
    "we have found the pipe models  and the characteristic moving shock front solution useful structures to describe the truncated transport dynamics and the deposition problem .",
    "it has a universal functional form and depends only on local conditions specified by the phenomenologies .",
    "it is adaptable and generalizable .",
    "in summary we thus have found : transport dynamics truncated by the allowed maximal volume density , combined with the hydrodynamics under lubrication approximation of a thin drop evaporating regularly with uniform or diffusion - controlled evaporation flux , gives a simple , tractable , and yet rich enough picture for the general contact line deposition phenomena . a few asymptotic regimes",
    "both in drying time and radial distance are identified and analyzed .",
    "we are able to predict in certain cases deposit profile and growth properties that are consistent with empirical evidence and previous findings .",

    "<S> away from the contact line , we for the first time identify the power - law decay of the deposit profile with respect to the radial distance . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> our work is consistent with and extends previous results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict features of the depinning process and multiple - ring patterns within dupont model , and our predictions are consistent with empirical evidence . </S>"
