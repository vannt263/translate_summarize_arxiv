    "the ( constrained ) primal - dual dynamics is a widespread continuous - time algorithm for determining the primal and dual solutions of an inequality constrained convex ( or concave ) optimization problem .",
    "this dynamics , first introduced in the pioneering works  @xcite , has been used in multiple applications , including network resource allocation problems for wireless systems  @xcite and distributed stabilization and optimization of power networks  @xcite .",
    "our objective in this paper is to provide a rigorous treatment of the convergence analysis of the primal - dual dynamics using classical notions from stability analysis .",
    "since this dynamics has a discontinuous right - hand side , the standard lyapunov or lasalle - based stability results for nonlinear systems , see e.g.  @xcite , are not directly applicable .",
    "this observation is at the basis of the direct approach to establish convergence taken in  @xcite , where the evolution of the distance of the solution of the primal - dual dynamics to an arbitrary primal - dual optimizer is approximated using power series expansions and its monotonic evolution is concluded by analyzing the local behavior around a saddle point of the terms in the series .",
    "instead ,  @xcite takes an indirect approach to establish convergence , modeling the primal - dual dynamics as a hybrid automaton as defined in  @xcite , and invoking a generalized lasalle invariance principle to establish asymptotic convergence .",
    "however , the hybrid automaton that corresponds to the primal - dual dynamics is in general not continuous , thereby not satisfying a key requirement of the invariance principle stated in  @xcite , and invalidating this route to establish convergence .",
    "the first contribution of this paper is an example that illustrates this point .",
    "our second contribution is an alternative proof strategy to arrive at the same convergence results of  @xcite .    for the problem setup",
    ", we consider an inequality constrained concave optimization problem described by continuously differentiable functions with locally lipschitz gradients . since the primal - dual dynamics has a discontinuous right - hand side ,",
    "we specify the notion of solution in the caratheodory sense ( note that this does not necessarily preclude the study of other notions of solution ) .",
    "we show that the primal - dual dynamics is a particular case of a projected dynamical system and , using results from  @xcite , we establish that caratheodory solutions exist , are unique , and are continuous with respect to the initial condition . using these properties , we show that the omega - limit set of any solution of the primal - dual dynamics is invariant under the dynamics .",
    "finally , we employ the invariance principle for caratheodory solutions of discontinuous dynamical systems from  @xcite to show that the primal - dual optimizers are globally asymptotically stable under the primal - dual dynamics and that each solution of the dynamics converges to an optimizer .",
