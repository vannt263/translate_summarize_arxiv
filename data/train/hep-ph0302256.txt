    "in a previous paper , we studied an extension of the standard model in which a real scalar @xmath2 triplet with zero hypercharge is added to the usual scalar @xmath2 doublet @xcite .",
    "we showed that such an extension is allowed by the precision data and that the mass of the lightest higgs boson can be as big as 500  gev .    to recap",
    ", the lagrangian of the model in terms of the usual standard model higgs , @xmath3 , and the new triplet , @xmath4 , reads @xmath5 with a scalar potential @xmath6 @xmath7 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the expansion of the field components is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the goldstone boson which is eaten by the @xmath11 .",
    "the model violates custodial symmetry at tree level giving a prediction for the @xmath12-parameter of @xmath13 as discussed in @xcite , it is precisely this violation of custodial symmetry which allows the lightest higgs to be much heavier than in the standard model . by giving the triplet a non - zero vacuum expectation value ,",
    "one is in effect making a positive tree - level contribution to the @xmath14-parameter , and this is enough to allow a heavier higgs .    in the neutral higgs sector",
    "we have two cp - even states which mix with angle @xmath15 .",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath16 are defined by @xmath17 there is also mixing in the charged higgs sector .",
    "we define the mass eigenstates @xmath18 by @xmath19 the @xmath20 are the goldstone bosons corresponding to @xmath21 and , at tree level , the mixing angle is @xmath22 the precision electroweak data constrain @xmath23 to be smaller than about @xmath24 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to examine the renormalization group flow of the couplings and hence establish bounds on the scalar masses under the assumption that the triplet model remain valid up to some scale @xmath25 .",
    "we take @xmath26 tev and make no statements about physics at higher scales . for the lagrangian of ( [ eqn : lag ] ) to remain appropriate up to @xmath25",
    ", we demand that the scalar couplings @xmath27 remain perturbative and that the vacuum remain stable ( i.e. is a local minimum ) up to @xmath25 .",
    "we begin in the next section with the calculation of the beta - functions . in section 3",
    "we present our results away from the decoupling limit of the model and in section 4 we discuss decoupling .",
    "the effective potential @xcite has the following one - loop expansion in the @xmath28 renormalization scheme and t  hooft - landau gauge : @xmath29 @xmath30 is the renormalization scale and @xmath31 .",
    "we have included the contributions from all the relevant physical states including the heaviest fermion , the top quark . the terms with @xmath32 correspond to the counterterms of the theory and the tree - level masses",
    "are @xmath33 it is understood that we should substitute explicitly for the mixing angles , which are solutions to the equations @xmath34    the expressions for the counterterms are thus @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the counterterm for the vacuum energy .",
    "the fact that the theory should be independent of the unphysical mass @xmath30 implies that the couplings and masses acquire a @xmath30 dependence governed by the renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the one - loop effective potential , i.e. @xmath37 in terms of the tree level masses this equation is equivalent to @xmath38 and , matching powers of fields , we can derive the beta functions : @xmath39 we can now make use of the anomalous dimensions for the two neutral higgs fields @xmath40 to write down our final expressions for the one - loop beta functions : @xmath41 in the gauge and top quark sector the beta functions for the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and yukawa couplings are the same as in the standard model , i.e. @xmath44 the @xmath2 coupling is modified due to the extra higgs triplet in the adjoint representation , i.e. @xmath45 working with the tree - level effective potential with couplings evolved using the one - loop @xmath23 and @xmath15 functions we are able to resum the leading logarithms to all orders in the effective potential",
    ". it would be possible to include the next - to - leading logarithmic contributions by using the two - loop @xmath23 and @xmath15 functions and including the one - loop part of the effective potential , see @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the rg analysis .",
    "we first introduce the parameter @xmath46 , related to the scale @xmath30 through @xmath47 .",
    "we shall perform evolution starting at @xmath48 .",
    "the rg equations are coupled differential equations in the set @xmath49 we choose rather to use the following set to define the input to the rg equations : @xmath50 within the accuracy to which we are working , the values of the couplings at @xmath48 can be obtained from the input set using the appropriate tree - level expressions .    the vacuum conditions , @xmath51 allow us to write ( defining @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) @xmath54 inverting these relations we can thus fix the @xmath48 boundary conditions for the subsequent evolution : @xmath55    to ensure that the system remains in a local minimum we impose the condition that the squared masses should remain positive , i.e. @xmath56 we impose the further requirement that the couplings remain perturbative . in particular we insist that @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we run the evolution from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , with @xmath26 tev .",
    "in this section we present our results of the higgs mass bounds in the regime where the triplet higgs can not be arbitrarily heavy . as we shall see in the next section , decoupling of the triplet",
    "occurs when both mixing angles and their sum @xmath62 tend to zero and in this case , the triplet decouples from the doublet and can be arbitrarily heavy .    we are free to choose the 3 scalar masses and the 2 mixing angles at @xmath48 . in figure [ b004g0 ]",
    "we show the range of higgs masses allowed when there is no mixing in the neutral higgs sector , @xmath63 , for a value of @xmath64 .",
    "such a value is towards the upper end of the range allowed by the precision data and is interesting because it allows a rather heavy lightest higgs ( e.g. for @xmath65  gev and for @xmath66  gev )  @xcite .",
    "the strong correlation between the @xmath67 and @xmath68 masses arises in order that @xmath69 remain perturbative ( @xmath70 for masses @xmath71 ) .",
    "the upper bound on the triplet higgs masses ( @xmath72  gev ) comes about from the perturbativity of @xmath73 whilst that on @xmath74 ( @xmath75  gev ) comes from the perturbativity of @xmath76 .",
    "these latter two bounds can be estimated crudely by ignoring the evolution of the couplings directly from equations ( [ lam1 ] ) and ( [ lam3 ] ) .",
    "evolution tightens the bounds due to the positivity of the beta functions , especially for the @xmath74 since @xmath77 .",
    "the hole at low masses is due to vacuum stability .    in figure [ b004g01 ]",
    "we show the allowed regions for @xmath78 .",
    "the correlation of the mainly triplet higgses is as in figure [ b004g0 ] . for large @xmath79 ( @xmath80  gev ) , the upper limit on the triplet higgs mass arises because @xmath76 becomes too large ( in this region @xmath81 . for smaller @xmath79",
    ", @xmath76 is much smaller than @xmath73 and the upper bound comes from the largeness of @xmath73 with the tree - level estimate being @xmath82 .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath79 is again a consequence of the perturbativity of @xmath76 , except at low @xmath67 masses , where it is due to the negativity of @xmath73 driving the vacuum unstable .",
    "for very low @xmath83 , @xmath69 becoming too large is the problem .    in figure [ b004gpi4 ] we show the allowed regions for @xmath84 . in this",
    "maximal mixing scenario one loses the distinction between doublet and triplet higgses and the bounds are correspondingly more democratic .",
    "the largeness of @xmath85 can be arranged either by tuning @xmath86 or by having small enough @xmath76 and @xmath87 . in the former case ,",
    "all masses are approximately degenerate , as can be seen in the plot . in the latter case , which corresponds to light masses , the degeneracy is lifted .",
    "the bounds for @xmath88 are very similar to those for @xmath89 on interchanging the neutral higgses @xmath68 and @xmath74 .    for @xmath90 and small @xmath15 ( but still away from the decoupling regime )",
    "the allowed regions are very similar to those for @xmath91 , i.e. as in figure [ b004g0 ] . for larger @xmath15 ,",
    "the mass bounds are again as for larger @xmath23 but with the correlation between the neutral and charged higgs masses becoming even stronger than for larger @xmath23 .",
    "we should stress that all of the previous discussion is valid for strictly non - zero @xmath23 .",
    "the situation is quite different for @xmath92 .",
    "if the neutral mixing is not zero ( which is required if we are to avoid decoupling ) then the vacuum conditions dictate that @xmath93 and @xmath94 and this renders equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) redundant . equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) then yields @xmath95 and we have complete degeneracy , i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "so far we have worked in a regime where the triplet does not decouple from the doublet .",
    "clearly for @xmath97 there is no mixing between the doublet and triplet and there is no bound on the triplet mass .",
    "this is a special case of the more general decoupling scenario , which occurs when @xmath98 , which we now discuss .    for small mixing angles ,",
    "the ( mainly ) triplet higgs has mass squared @xmath99 .",
    "one possible solution to the mixing angle equations ( [ eq : beta ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma ] ) is that @xmath100 and any @xmath15 . in this case",
    "the triplet higgs has mass @xmath71 .",
    "this is the regime of the previous section .",
    "however , it is also possible to solve the mixing angle equations with @xmath101 by keeping @xmath102 large , i.e. ( [ eq : beta ] ) gives @xmath103 .",
    "in this case , equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) forces @xmath104 .",
    "this is the decoupling limit in which the triplet mass lies far above the mass of the doublet and the low energy model looks identical to the standard model .",
    "tree level arguments on the perturbativity of @xmath73 allow us to quantify the approach to decoupling from the point of view of the triplet higgs mass .",
    "in particular ( [ lam3 ] ) dictates that , for small @xmath23 and @xmath15 , @xmath105 by virtue of the smallness of @xmath106 this relation picks up relatively small loop corrections .",
    "this bound clearly demonstrates decoupling .",
    "it also re - iterates the results of the previous section , i.e. for small @xmath107 the limit is as in figure 1 and for small @xmath108 the limit is as in figure 2 .",
    "we remark that the pseudo - decoupling regime , where @xmath23 is not too small , is of particular interest in that it again allows one to relax the mass bound on the lightest higgs coming from the precision data without otherwise changing the physics of the standard model @xcite .",
    "we have computed the one - loop beta functions for the scalar couplings in an extension to the standard model which contains an additional real triplet higgs . through considerations of perturbativity of the couplings and vacuum stability we have been able to identify the allowed masses of the higgs bosons in the non - decoupling regime . in the decoupling regime",
    ", the model tends to resemble the standard model .",
    "we note that the theoretical mass bounds presented here will of course be tightened after considering the precision electroweak and direct search data .",
    "such a study requires that the impact of the quantum corrections ( to the @xmath14 parameter ) for non - zero @xmath15 be computed ( they were not explored in @xcite ) .    as a final remark",
    ", we wish to emphasise that the near degeneracy of the triplet higgs masses ( the mass splitting is naturally @xmath109 ) ensures that , at least for small @xmath15 , the quantum corrections to the @xmath14 parameter are negligible ( the @xmath110 parameter vanishing since the triplet has zero hypercharge ) @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this means that the lightest higgs boson can be heavy as a result of the compensation arising from the explicit tree - level violation of custodial symmetry which the real triplet induces .",
    "thus it is quite possible to be in a regime where all the higgs bosons are heavy without any dramatic deviation from the physics of the standard model .",
