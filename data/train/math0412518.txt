    "an important problem in khler geometry is that of finding a constant scalar curvature khler ( csck ) metric in a given khler class on a complex manifold @xmath1 . for a curve",
    "this is provided by the uniformisation theorem . for general @xmath1 the class @xmath9\\in h^2(x,{\\mathbb r})$ ]",
    "admits a khler - einstein metric ( which is therefore csck ) when @xmath10 @xcite , or when @xmath7 and @xmath9=-\\lambda[c_1(x)]$ ] @xcite .",
    "the first known obstructions to the existence of csck metrics came from the holomorphic automorphism group .",
    "the most famous is the calabi - futaki invariant of the khler class .",
    "this is a character on the lie algebra @xmath11 of the holomorphic automorphism group which must vanish if the class admits a csck metric @xcite .",
    "tian defined a finer obstruction called k - stability , arising from certain degenerations ( or _ test configurations _ ) of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover it is conjectured that k - polystability is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of csck metrics ; see conjecture [ conj : csck ] .",
    "one direction of this conjecture is now almost proved : it is known that csck implies k - semistability @xcite .",
    "thus test configurations can provide obstructions to csck metrics .",
    "in particular those arising from a @xmath12-action recover the calabi - futaki obstruction , and these  product configurations \" are currently the only test configurations that have been systematically studied .",
    "in this paper we consider test configurations canonically associated to subschemes of @xmath1 , yielding a new obstruction to the existence of csck metrics .",
    "these configurations are more complicated than product configurations , in particular the central fibre is non - normal .",
    "the motivation is an analogy with stability for vector bundles ; just as subsheaves can destabilise a sheaf or bundle we show how subschemes can destabilise @xmath1 . in section [ sec : definitionofslope ] we define , by analogy with vector bundles , a notion of slope ( semi)stability of a manifold and rational khler class .",
    "we prove in section [ sec : kstabilityimpliesslopestability ] that this gives an obstruction to k - semistability , and hence to csck metrics .",
    "that is k - semistability implies slope semistability .",
    "a partial converse is given in theorem 6.1 of @xcite ; in particular the two are shown to be equivalent for curves . in trying to form moduli of varieties in algebraic geometry using geometric invariant theory ,",
    "other stability conditions arise , for instance chow stability . different notions of slope are given for these in @xcite , and stability is shown to imply the relevant slope stability ( proposition 4.33 and theorem 7.2 of @xcite ) .    in section [ sec",
    ": nonpositive ] we show slope stability for the canonical class when @xmath7 , and for arbitrary classes when @xmath10 ( as expected from the existence of their khler - einstein metrics ) .",
    "we also show slope stability for classes close to the canonical class when @xmath7 , and compare to some similar analytical results of @xcite .",
    "slope stability of smooth curves is proved in [ sec : slopestabilitysmoothcurves ] , which by corollary 6.7 of @xcite implies k - stability .",
    "as far as we know this is the only direct , non - analytic proof of k - stability of smooth curves .",
    "we apply the slope formula to study unstable projective bundles in section [ proj ] , providing a converse to the results of hong @xcite .",
    "when the base is a curve , the narasimhan - seshadri theorem gives a csck metric on the projectivisation of any polystable bundle ( of arbitrary rank ) in any khler class , and we are able to give an almost complete converse ( there is a small discrepancy for bundles which are strictly semistable but not polystable until the results of @xcite are improved to give k - polystability ) .",
    "other examples include unstable blow ups in section [ sec : blowups ] and unstable rational manifolds in section [ sec : rational ] .",
    "in particular we give examples of khler classes on surfaces with trivial automorphism group which do not admit csck metrics ( [ rmk : folklore ] ) .",
    "one might hope that in the continuity method to find a csck metric , the multiplier ideal sheaf along which the @xmath13-estimates required for closedness fail @xcite defines a subscheme which slope destabilises the variety . in particular",
    "if one could show this for canonically polarised manifolds then theorem [ thm : kstableimpliesslopestable ] combined with nadel s results would solve the khler - einstein problem for fano manifolds .         in this paper @xmath14 will be a smooth complex manifold of dimension @xmath15 with a polarisation @xmath8 ( _ i.e. _  an ample line bundle on @xmath1 ) .",
    "furthermore @xmath3 will denote an arbitrary subscheme of @xmath1 defined by an ideal sheaf @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath3 is smooth @xmath17 will denote its normal bundle .",
    "the blow up along @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath18 , with exceptional divisor @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath19 for @xmath20 . for convenience",
    "we often suppress pullback maps and use the same letter to denote a divisor and the associated line bundle .",
    "for example on @xmath21 , we denote @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "the intersection product of divisors @xmath24 on @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath25 , and this is abbreviated to @xmath26 in sections [ divisors ] and [ sec : nonpositive ] .",
    "a @xmath27-divisor is a formal sum of divisors with rational coefficients ; some multiple is therefore a divisor with an associated line bundle .",
    "a @xmath27-divisor is said to be ample if it can be written as a formal sum of ample divisors with positive rational coefficients .",
    "we recall that a nef line bundle ( or divisor ) is one whose intersection with every curve in @xmath1 is nonnegative , and this extends to @xmath27-line bundles . by the kleiman criterion @xcite these divisors",
    "are precisely those in the closure of the ample cone . in notation like @xmath28",

    "the integers @xmath36 are the _ weights _ of the action , and @xmath37 is the _ total weight _ of the action ; _ i.e. _  the weight of the induced action on the top exterior power @xmath38 .",
    "we would most like to thank simon donaldson , who suggested looking at stability of projective bundles @xmath39 via the degeneration mentioned in ( [ ext1 ] ) .",
    "as we discuss there , the deformation to the normal cone collapses to this degeneration in one special case , and it was this case that motivated our study of the normal cone ; without his invaluable suggestion we would never have looked at stability of varieties .",

    "donaldson @xcite gave an algebro - geometric definition that allows arbitrarily singular central fibre and which we use here .",
    "the relation between the two is studied in @xcite .",
    "there is a strong formal link between k - stability and stability notions in geometric invariant theory ; in particular the test configurations defined below are what one gets by applying a one parameter subgroup of projective linear transformations to the kodaira embedding of @xmath40 , and what we call the donaldson - futaki invariant is the git weight of the induced action on a certain line",
