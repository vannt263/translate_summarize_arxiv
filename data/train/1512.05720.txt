    "<S> the most of this nc charge is transfered by the dielectric response to the surface of the nc  @xcite . as a result , the energy of a charged nc @xmath15 called the charging energy is the unique function of the nc charge @xmath68 and the nc size @xmath3 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the capacitance of a nc immersed in the array and the effective dielectric constant @xmath71 describes the charging , which is a local response . </S>",
