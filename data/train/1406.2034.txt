    "electron correlation plays a crucial role in understanding most physical phenomena in molecules and extended systems .",
    "while highly accurate many - body approaches can be nowadays routinely employed in molecular systems , solid state applications remains dominated by density functional theory ( dft ) . despite the undeniable success of dft in extended systems ,",
    "@xcite there are significant limitations appearing from the approximate form of the exchange - correlation functional @xcite and much work remains to be done in order to ensure systematically improvable predictions .",
    "@xcite an alternative route for incorporating electron correlations is to employ wavefunction - based methods .",
    "recently , significant progress in applying such many - body theories for solid state problems has been made .",
    "@xcite    size - extensive , wavefunction - based approaches to solids treat the system as a whole , imposing translational symmetry and brillouin zone integration .",
    "finite order perturbation theory @xcite and coupled cluster ( cc ) methods @xcite have been formulated and implemented for infinite systems .",
    "alternatively , the numerical complexity associated with numerous electronic degrees of freedom in solids has been simplified , for example , by means of the method of increments .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , electron correlation in extended systems is accounted for via an embedding approach .",
    "the infinite periodic problem is transformed into one of a small fragment ( unit cell ) entangled with an effective bath . in order to define the bath",
    ", we employ the recently introduced density embedding theory ( det ) , @xcite which is a simplification of density matrix embedding theory ( dmet ) .",
    "@xcite here , an approximate solution to the infinite periodic system , typically hartree - fock , is used to construct two basis sets .",
    "the first basis is associated with a small part of the lattice ( fragment ) whereas the second is used to describe the excluded complement ( bath ) .",
    "subsequently , one solves the many - body problem for the fragment plus bath , a so - called impurity problem . in this way",
    ", correlations between the fragment and the rest of the system are represented by a many - electron environment , not a single - particle potential .",
    "@xcite the hartree - fock ( hf ) choice for an approximate solution of the infinite solid affords the desired bases in a trivial algebraic manner via diagonalization .",
    "moreover , the resulting hamiltonian describing the fragment - bath interaction is defined in a much smaller single - particle hilbert space as compared to the full lattice hamiltonian .",
    "thus , this construction opens the possibility of employing highly accurate many - body techniques to tackle extended systems .    indeed , dmet and det with exact diagonalization@xcite and density matrix renormalization group@xcite as impurity solvers have been shown to provide high - quality descriptions of model hamiltonians and molecular systems . in the present work we extend the applicability of this novel approximation to realistic extended systems .",
    "such problems seem a promising niche for this embedding scheme . the definition of fragment is naturally dictated by the periodicity of the system which greatly simplifies the procedure .",
    "we propose a way of defining the local hamiltonian that guarantees exactness of mean - field in mean - field embedding and facilitates coping with the coulomb problem in solids .",
    "additionally , we discuss practical issues related to preparing the fragment and bath basis for an infinite number of electrons and the problem of disentangled states .    while in the current work we benchmark the det scheme by describing the fragment - bath interaction at the coupled cluster level of theory , we stress that the methodology is flexible enough to accommodate any correlated wavefunction method .",
    "indeed , the purpose of det is to provide a finite , small dimension effective hamiltonian which should account for locally important degrees of freedom .",
    "then , any many - body technique may be employed to solve the impurity problem at hand .",
    "in particular , very accurate and computationally affordable schemes @xcite may be used to study extended systems with realistic unit cell sizes .",
    "in order to keep this paper self - contained , we present in this section a basic introduction to density matrix and density embedding theories .",
    "more details can be found in the original papers .",
    "@xcite subsequently , we discuss the changes required to apply the formalism to the _ ab initio _ hamiltonian of extended systems .",
    "this includes the schmidt decomposition of slater determinants for infinite systems and the formulation of an impurity hamiltonian that allows us to deal with the coulomb divergence in solids .",
    "unless otherwise specified , single - particle indices denote both spin and spatial coordinates . in the context of periodic systems ,",
    "cell coordinates are implicitly included except when confusion may arise .      density matrix embedding theory and its simplification , density embedding theory , are projections of the exact hamiltonian onto a basis obtained by schmidt decomposition of the ground state wavefunction @xmath0 . to be precise",
    ", one may cast @xmath0 into @xcite @xmath1 represents the part of the system of interest , the fragment , whereas @xmath2 represents the rest of the system , the bath . with such states at hand ,",
    "an impurity hamiltonian is defined , latexmath:[\\ ] ]      in the following section we suggest a route for dealing with the eigenvalues of @xmath16 that are close to 1 or 0 . as",
    "the reader may easily note , whenever a situation like this occurs , one may face numerical problems with the normalization of embedding basis .",
    "the trivial solution , i.e. removing the couple of bath and fragment states that are disentangled , can not be easily done ; one would eliminate possibly important degrees of freedom in the fragment .",
    "let us consider that there exists a set of eigenvalues @xmath27 that are close to 1 .",
    "in such a case , we propose to remove the bath state and retain a modified fragment state that takes the form @xmath133 , these states are orthonormal and orthogonal to all other fragment and bath states .",
    "moreover , the density matrix in such a basis takes the form , @xmath134 where the last block is expressed in the basis @xmath135 .",
    "as is clear , @xmath80 remains idempotent .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the commutation relation between the one - body density matrix and fock matrix is preserved .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the situation when there exists a set of eigenvalues @xmath27 that are close to 0 .",
    "we propose to construct an auxiliary matrix @xmath136 , @xmath137 this matrix admits eigendecomposition @xmath138 .",
    "let us show that for every eigenvalue @xmath23 of @xmath16 different from 0 , @xmath136 has eigenvalue @xmath139 .",
    "we define a column vector @xmath140 with a norm @xmath141 .",
    "hence it is a non - trivial vector whenever @xmath23 is not an exact zero .",
    "one may now explicitly verify that @xmath142    we show that one may replace a fragment state @xmath143 with eigenvalue close to 0 , with the state @xmath144 and remove a bath state entangled with @xmath143 .",
    "let us now demonstrate that @xmath145 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath146 is orthogonal to all fragment states @xmath147 corresponding to @xmath148 not equal to @xmath149 .",
    "namely , @xmath150 must vanish whenever @xmath151 .",
    "similarly , for the bath states not associated with fragment @xmath147 , @xmath152 the orthogonality to states @xmath153 ( eq . [ zerostate ] ) also follows .",
    "finally , the density matrix in the embedding basis as define above takes the form @xmath154 one may also verify that the product of the fock and density matrices in the embedding basis remains hermitian ( one again uses the fact that @xmath155 to show that @xmath156 ) .    as is clear , the density matrix above is idempotent and traces to an integer number of particles .",
    "therefore , it dictates the number of electrons we include in the impurity problem .",
    "however , as in the fragment space we replace eigenvalues that differ from one and zero by a preset value , the total number of particles in the fragment may deviate from the actual with an error proportional to chosen threshold .",
    "let us finally note that in the derivation above we assumed that eigenvalues of fragment states are arbitrarily small but nonzero . in practical calculations , we did not encounter any problems while forming the fragment states from eigenvectors of @xmath16 above the preset threshold and filling the missing fragment states with the eigenvectors of @xmath136 to complete the set .",
