    "almost six decades ago in 1950 hahn demonstrated that spin echos in liquid nmr can be obtained by applying a @xmath0 pulse in the middle of a time interval @xcite .",

    "further refinements were introduced by meiboom and gill @xcite . since",
    "then this technique of coherent control has been established in nmr , see e.g.  ref ..    the fascinating possibilities of quantum information have stimulated a great interest in the coherent control of small quantum systems , see e.g.ref .  .",
    "the idea to preserve coherence by iterated @xmath0 pulses periodic in time was rediscovered in the context of quantum information by viola and lloyd @xcite and by ban @xcite in 1998 for a spin - boson model and subsequently generalized to open systems @xcite ; a short review is found in ref .  . for symmetry groups with inefficient representations",
    "randomized protocols are advocated , see ref .   and references therein .",
    "recently , periodically iterated carr - purcell cycles have been advocated for the preservation of the coherence of the electronic spin in quantum dots @xcite . besides periodic iteration of pulse cycles also concatenations of cycles were proposed and it was shown that they suppress decoherence in higher orders @xmath1 in the length of the time interval @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "but the achieved exponent @xmath3 grows only logarithmically in the number of pulses @xmath4 .    in parallel",

    "in semi - conductor physics there are many encouraging results in prolonging the coherence time of a qubit by @xmath0 pulses @xcite . in experiment , one must trade off between the advantages of the suppression of decoherence by multiply applied pulses with the detrimental effects of imperfect realizations of pulses , for instance the finite duration of a pulse so that it can not be regarded as instantaneous @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present article is threefold .",
    "first , we provide the explicit calculations leading to the important relation .",
    "second , we generalize the previous result @xcite on a particular signal to a statement on the unitary time evolution .",
    "thereby , we provide the general proof for the applicability of for an arbitrary initial quantum state .",
    "third , we use various spectral densities @xmath12 in the spin - boson model to discuss under which conditions the optimized sequence works well , namely when the high - energy cutoff of the decohering environment is hard enough . to cope with medium hard cutoffs we propose iterated sequences of short optimized cycles of pulses .",

    "section [ sec : uv ] presents a discussion of the applicability of the optimized sequences and establishes a link to the nature of the high energy cutoff .",

    "we consider the model given by the hamilton operator @xmath13 consisting of a single qubit interpreted as spin @xmath14 , whose operators are the pauli matrices @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the environment is given by the bosonic bath with annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath17 .",
    "the constant @xmath18 sets the energy offset .",
    "the properties of the bath are defined by the set of real parameters @xmath19 .",
    "this information is conveniently encoded in the spectral density @xcite @xmath20 obviously , @xmath21 in does not allow for spin flips since it commutes with @xmath16 .",
    "physically this means that the decay time @xmath22 of a magnetization along @xmath23 is infinite .",
    "but the decoherence of a magnetization in the @xmath24-plane is captured by @xmath21 so that the decay time @xmath25 can be investigated in the framework of this model .",

    "we discuss the simple experimental setup without any @xmath0 pulses .",
    "we start from the state @xmath34 .",
    "then a @xmath35 pulse is applied to rotate the spin from the @xmath23-direction to the @xmath36-plane . to be specific ,",
    "we rotate the spin about @xmath37 by the angle @xmath38 with the help of the unitary transformation    @xmath39    the rotation is best seen by stating that @xmath40 for @xmath41 a spin along @xmath23 is turned into a spin along @xmath42 .",
    "we will use @xmath43 .    in the @xmath36 plane",
    "the spin will evolve .",
    "after the time @xmath2 a measurement of @xmath44 yields the signal @xmath45 since @xmath21 does not induce spin flips and @xmath46 we know that @xmath47 and @xmath48    to evaluate this expression explicitly we change to the basis in which @xmath21 is diagonal @xmath49 note that the state @xmath50 is not altered by @xmath28 .",
    "for the explicit calculation of the effective operators we use @xmath51 and obtain    @xmath52    hence the action on particular spin states is    [ eq : spinids ] @xmath53    where either the first spin orientation and the upper sign holds or the second spin orientation and the lower sign .    turning to the time dependence we define generally the time dependent operators @xmath54 note that @xmath55 contains only the bosonic degrees of freedom and it is diagonal . hence it is easy to see that    @xmath56    whence @xmath57 with these definitions the identities apply also to the time dependent operators @xmath58 and @xmath59    [ eq : spinids - time ] @xmath60    with these identities we can write for the signal    @xmath61    where we took the expectation value in the spin sector in so that only a bosonic expectation value with respect to the bilinear @xmath55 must be computed .",

    "are rederived in all detail .",
    "the above derivation sets the stage for the derivation in the case of dynamical decoupling by sequences of @xmath0 pulses .",
    "here we consider a sequence of @xmath0 pulses which are applied at the instants of time @xmath76 with @xmath77 so that @xmath4 pulses are applied and the total time interval @xmath2 is divided into @xmath78 subintervals .",
    "for notational convenience we set @xmath79 and @xmath80 it is understood that @xmath81 for all @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath0 pulses are taken to be ideal , that means they are instantaneous so that during their application no coupling to the bath needs to be considered .",
    "the possible workarounds if this is not justified in experiment are discussed elsewhere @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we take the @xmath0 pulses to be realized as rotations about @xmath44    @xmath83    which implies for @xmath84 simply @xmath85 . below we will use @xmath44 only because the factor @xmath86 corresponds to an irrelevant global phase shift .",
    "the signal is given in general as before by @xmath87 where the time evolution is changed its form @xmath88 in to @xmath89 the expression becomes much more compact if written after the diagonalisation by @xmath28 as given in @xmath90 where we express @xmath91 based on in the form @xmath92 then we arrive easily at @xmath93    equation can be converted by means of into the following purely bosonic expression @xmath94 counting the factors @xmath95 and @xmath86 one finds that they all combine to a single factor @xmath86 .",
    "this is easiest seen by combining the prefactors in front of each of the terms @xmath96 which all occur twice so that each kind of these terms provides a factor @xmath97 yielding a total factor @xmath98 .",
    "this is multiplied with @xmath99 from the prefactor of @xmath100 which is the only term occuring only once .",
    "hence we have @xmath101 applying the bch formula yields    [ eq : s - general3 ] @xmath102    where we used the identity to obtain the second line .",
    "therein the suppression @xmath103 results from    [ eq : multi - delta ] @xmath104    where @xmath105 thereby we arrive at    [ eq : finchi ] @xmath106",
    "the phase @xmath107 in can easily be computed by the following trick .",
    "using we combine the second and third factor in , i.e. , the two exponentials @xmath108 , to one exponential _ and _ the last and last - but - one factor , i.e. , @xmath109 .",
    "obviously , the occuring phases cancel .",
    "this procedure can be repeated by including the factor @xmath110 next both in the growing last exponential and in the second exponential .",
    "iteration up to and including the factor @xmath111 , which can be thought as being split into @xmath112 , leads to two exponentials whose respective arguments contain all term @xmath113 except the very first @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , the two respective arguments are equal so that the exponentials can be combined without further phase yielding @xmath115 from this equation we arrive at by defining    [ eq : finphi ] @xmath116\\\\ & = & i \\sum_i \\frac{\\lambda_i^2}{4\\omega_i^2}(y_n(\\omega_i t ) - y_n^*(\\omega_i t ) ) \\label{eq : phi - general - final - b } \\\\ & = & i \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{j(\\omega)}{4\\omega^2 } ( y_n(\\omega t ) - y_n^*(\\omega t ) ) d\\omega\\\\ & = & \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{j(\\omega)}{2\\omega^2 } x_n(\\omega t)d\\omega \\label{eq : phi - general - final - d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we used in the second line .",
    "the last line reproduces eq .",
    "( 8b ) in ref .   with    [ eq : x - from - y ] @xmath117    where the last line corrects eq .",
    "( 9 ) in ref .   in the factor 2 in front of the sum .",
    "thereby , we have derived all the results used in the analysis in the previous paper @xcite .      a particular asset of the equations ( [ eq : finres],[eq : finchi],[eq : finphi ] )",
    "together with is that it is obvious that any deviation of the signal @xmath118 from unity is kept as low as possible if @xmath119 is kept as small as possible .",
    "note that this strategy holds equally well for @xmath120 and for @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath122 is of the order @xmath123 in some small parameter @xmath123 , for instance @xmath124 , then @xmath125 whence we deduce @xmath126 .",
    "in analogy , we find @xmath127 whence we deduce @xmath128 so that both factors are close to unity in the same way .",
    "hence the total signal @xmath118 is close to unity in this order @xmath129 .",
    "so our aim is to choose the @xmath4 instants @xmath130 such that @xmath131 is as small as possible .",
    "the best way to do so is to make the first @xmath4 derivatives of @xmath131 vanish .",
    "note that @xmath132 for any sequence @xmath130 .",
    "the @xmath133th derivative reads ( @xmath134 ) @xmath135 hence we have to solve the set of nonlinear equations @xmath136 for @xmath137 . for finite @xmath4 , solutions can easily be found analytically @xcite and numerically .",
    "closer inspection of these numerical solutions reveals that they are excellently described by the condition .    indeed",
    ", we can prove that is a valid solution for the set of equations .",
    "to do so we choose a little detour by considering @xmath138 obviously the equivalence @xmath139 holds so that the vanishing of the first @xmath4 derivatives of @xmath131 is equivalent to the vanishing of the first @xmath4 derivatives of @xmath140 .",
    "the choice implies by standard trigonometric identities @xmath141 inserting this choice into @xmath142 yields    @xmath143\\\\ & = & \\sum_{j =- n-1}^n(-1)^j \\exp[-ih\\cos(\\pi j/(n+1))].\\qquad\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    obviously @xmath144 .",
    "the @xmath133th derivative ( @xmath134 ) reads @xmath145 we compute explicitly @xmath146    @xmath147    the last sum , however , vanishes for @xmath148    @xmath149    since the denominator in remains finite in this range .",
    "hence @xmath150 and we know @xmath151 and hence @xmath152 .",
    "this concludes the formal proof that represents a valid solution of the set of nonlinear equations . we have not presented a proof that this is the only solution .",
    "but we presume that it is the only one which is physically meaningful with consecutive values @xmath153 .      in ref .",
    "we argued that the fact that the optimized sequence works independently from the precise temperature indicates that it applies also to classical , gaussian noise .",
    "the argument runs qualitatively as follows . because is the optimum sequence for all temperatures it holds of course also for @xmath154 . in this limit",
    ", the thermal fluctuations dominate over all the quantum effects and the bath behaves completely classically .",
    "a crucial corollary is that the pulse sequence can be used for all kinds of bath at elevated temperatures because all physical systems behave like classical , gaussian baths at high temperatures .",
    "hence the applicability extends beyond the spin - boson model discussed so far .",
    "we will discuss the general validity of in more detail in the next section .    here",
    "we present the calculation for classical noise in order to establish a quantitative relation .",
    "we consider the decoherence due to @xmath155 where @xmath156 is a random variable with gaussian distribution . by a factor of 2 relative to our previous work @xcite to keep the notation concise .",
    "] it is characterized by the expectation values    @xmath157    note the translational invariance in time .",
    "then the signal @xmath118 after a @xmath35 pulse reads @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the primitive of @xmath156 . since @xmath160 only flip the spin , see for instance eq .   for @xmath161 , we may write    @xmath162    where we exploited the properties of gaussian random variables to obtain the second line .",
    "the exponent can be computed easily    @xmath163    where we used @xmath164 to obtain and the fourier representation for @xmath165 based on the power spectrum @xmath166 . the comparison with the quantum mechanical result ( [ eq : qm - result1],[eq : qm - result2 ] ) yields",
    "exactly the same form except that @xmath167 because there are no operators which might not commute with themselves .",
    "the argument of the exponential @xmath168 is identical if we identify @xmath169 this provides the quantitative correspondence between the classical calculation and the general quantum mechanical one .",
    "the extension to the signal in presence of the @xmath0 pulses is also straightforward .",
    "the signal is given as in except that the time evolution @xmath170 is classically given by @xmath171 again , the dynamics of the spin is easily computed since it flips at each @xmath44 or @xmath172 according to .",
    "the final result is @xmath173 where @xmath174 is given by @xmath175 where @xmath176 switches the sign according to @xmath177 for @xmath178 .",
    "note that the fourier transform @xmath179 of @xmath176 is given essentially by @xmath180 @xmath181 next @xmath182 is expressed as convolution and integral    @xmath183    for the last line , fourier transformation , parseval identity and the symmetry of the integrand are used .",
    "again , we retrieve the quantum mechanical result ( [ eq : finres],[eq : finchi - b ] ) except for the phase @xmath107 which does not occur at all in the classical framework . the necessary identification is the same as before .",
    "we conclude that the classical decoherence and the one due to a quantum bosonic bath coincide except for the phases if the power spectrum @xmath184 is identified with the product of spectral density @xmath12 and bosonic occupation factor @xmath185 .",
    "hence the optimization of the quantum model applies equally to the classical problem .",
    "therefore , the optimization applies to all models with ( commuting ) gaussian fluctuations .",
    "so far we focused on the signal @xmath118 as it results from a measurement of @xmath44 after a @xmath35 pulse around @xmath172 .",
    "this appears to be a special choice .",
    "but in view of the spin rotational symmetry about the @xmath23 axis it is sufficiently general to guarantee that the coherence of an arbitrary initial state is preserved by the optimized pulse sequence . to corroborate this point and to prepare for the discussion of the most general model for phase coherence we discuss the time evolution operator @xmath186 of the spin - boson model in this section .    the unitary operator @xmath186 is defined in . using the identities ( [ eq : eff - op],[eq : reff ] )",
    "we get    @xmath187    inserting the time dependent version of ( cf.also eq .   )",
    "@xmath188 into and using yields for @xmath4 even @xmath189 while for @xmath4 odd we arrive at @xmath190 these results are combined to yield for the total time evolution @xmath191 where the upper entry in the curly brackets refers to @xmath4 even , the lower one to @xmath4 odd . the multiple difference is defined and computed in . combining all the exponents to a single",
    "one makes a phase @xmath192 occur which can be computed by commuting the various expression @xmath193 as required in",
    ". we do not give the explicit expression because we do not need it here .",
    "what is important is that this phase is a global one .",
    "it is just a real number and it does not depend on the spin ; no pauli matrix occurs because @xmath194 .",
    "similarly , @xmath55 does not depend on the spin .    to assess to which extent the time evolution depends on the spin state we consider the difference between the evolution of an @xmath195 and of a @xmath196 state .",
    "we define for @xmath4 even    @xmath197    and for @xmath4 odd    @xmath198    where the subscript @xmath199 signifies that we compute the expectation value only with respect to the hilbert space of the spin .",
    "the bosonic operators remain unaltered .",
    "then we consider    @xmath200\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as proposed by lee et al .",
    "@xcite . from the last formula",
    "and it is obvious that the influence of the spin state is small for general sets @xmath201 if and only if @xmath131 is small .",
    "quantitatively , one has @xmath202 thereby , we have shown explicitly that the condition @xmath203 implies generally that the coupling between any spin state , i.e. , any state of the quantum bit , and the bosonic bath is efficiently suppressed if the pulse sequence obeys .",
    "note that this holds for all choices of @xmath201 .",
    "so far we considered the spin - boson model .",
    "one might think that the optimized sequence is useful only for this model @xcite .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the first evidence for the general applicability of is the fact that classical gaussian noise can equally well be suppressed , see subsect .",
    "[ ss : classical ] .",
    "conventional wisdom has it that any generic model with fluctuations will display gaussian fluctuations in its high temperature limit .",
    "if this is true the optimized sequence is applicable generally for high temperatures .",
    "note that the `` high '' temperatures need not be really high .",
    "the inter - spin coupling of nuclear spins is so low that already 1 kelvin is sufficient to put a system of nuclear spins at high temperatures .",
    "the second evidence was found by lee et al .",
    "they observed analytically for up to @xmath10 that an expansion of @xmath204 in powers of @xmath2 for a general model yields vanishing coefficients for the optimized sequence .",
    "on the basis of this observation they conjectured that the optimized sequence is generally applicable for the generic model for phase decoherence , also called single axis decoherence model @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 contain only operators from the bath . below we use the notation @xmath208 .",
    "this model does not include spin flips ; hence it implies an infinite life time @xmath22 as a completely general decoherence model would do .",
    "but the phase decoherence of a precessing spin in the @xmath36 plane is described in full generality because we do not specify for which operator @xmath207 stands and the bath dynamics is fully unspecified .",
    "it is described by @xmath206 .",
    "such a model is experimentally very well justified as the effective model in the limit of a large applied magnetic field which implies that other couplings between the quantum bit spin and the bath are averaged out , see for instance refs .   and .",

    "we considered only the existence and the vanishing of the derivatives of @xmath131 .",

    "[ fig : various ] .",
    "we conclude that one should always try to use one of the other sequences .    comparing the cdd and",
    "the cmpg sequences the cpmg sequence is almost everywhere advantageous .",
    "only for very low deviations @xmath258 the cdd does better because its curve is steeper reflecting a higher order in @xmath2 : @xmath290 while @xmath291 .    comparing the cdd and the udd sequences the udd sequence yields always lower deviations , except for very soft cutoffs ( @xmath292 ) where both sequences behave equally .",
    "we conclude that we can not explain the behavior found by lee et al .",
    "@xcite where the cdd sequence seemed to outperform the udd on the basis of the spin - boson model . note that the slope of both sequences in fig .",
    "[ fig : various ] seems to be similar though this is difficult to tell from the depicted range of parameters .",
    "but the analytic results clearly states @xmath293 while @xmath294 for the same number of pulses , namely @xmath283 .",

    "this was also observed in a model of classical gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "the udd sequence , however , performs better for large values of @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , this finding supports our analytical condition . as long as @xmath295 the cpmg sequence with its relatively low order @xmath296 ( in @xmath180 ) does slightly better than the high - order udd with @xmath297 .",
    "but for @xmath298 the udd outperforms the cpmg , especially for low deviations @xmath258 which matter most for quantum information processing .",
    "( legend holds for dashed and solid lines ) and a spectral density with @xmath299 corresponding to a cutoff of intermediate hardness .",
    "other values are fixed : @xmath300    we substantiate the comparison between the udd and the cpmg sequence further by fig .",
    "[ fig : cpmg - udd ] .",
    "the results go into the same direction as before . as long as @xmath301 the udd does significantly better than the cpmg . for @xmath302",

    "this constitutes a clear message for applications .",
    "one may wonder whether there is a way to combine the advantages of the udd and of the cpmg sequence .",
    "indeed , this is possible by resorting to hybrid solutions proposed already earlier @xcite .",
    "the udd cycles with low values of @xmath4 can be iterated .",
    "we denote such a sequence by @xmath306 where @xmath133 stands for the number of pulses within one cycle and @xmath307 for the number of cycles so that @xmath308 is the total number of pulses .",
    "this means we consider the concatenation @xmath309     sequences for a total number of @xmath310 pulses and various cutoff exponents @xmath38 .",

    "another remark for experimental realizations is in order .",
    "if the pulses are not ideally tailored then the advantageous of dynamical decoupling will be thwarted by accumulated pulse errors .",
    "so in practice one always will be faced with the need to find the optimum tradeoff .",
    "note , however , that this fact makes it particularly interesting to reach an optimum suppression of decoherence with a _ small _ number of pulses .",

    "in particular it was rigorously shown that the sequence ( udd ) makes the first @xmath4 derivatives vanish .",

    "the most important observation is that decoherence due to baths with very soft cutoffs are much more difficult to suppress than decoherence due to baths with hard cutoffs . for soft cutoffs , the simpler sequences ( cpmg@xmath320 or @xmath321 with low values of @xmath133 )",
