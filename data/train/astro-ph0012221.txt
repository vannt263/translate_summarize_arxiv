    "studies of ulirgs at different wavelengths face a variety of challenges . these include attenuation at shorter wavelengths ( soft x - ray to optical ) due to high extinction , and poor spatial resolution at longer wavelengths ( mid- to far - infrared ) .",
    "a good compromise can be found in the near - infrared .",
    "although there have been a number of jhk imaging studies of ulirgs @xcite , colours have tended to be examined in large apertures for which dilution from extended emission can be significant .",
    "we present data on 2 objects from a larger sample , with a resolution @xmath20.5  allowing us to probe much closer into the nucleus .",
    "furthermore , combining imaging data with spectroscopy provides much tighter constraints on the origin of the continuum , which can not be achieved with k - band spectra alone .",
    "fig  [ fig:2336im ] shows the k - band image of iras2336 , which displays signs of interaction although with no obvious nearby candidates , at a resolution of 0.40 .",
    "the colours in incremental annuli out to 5  are drawn in the jh - hk colour diagram .",
    "the nucleus ( classified as a liner @xcite or composite @xcite ) is reddest ; colours at larger radii become bluer until beyond a radius of @xmath31.5  they stabilise . for comparison",
    "the diagram shows at the redshift of the galaxy , the colours of stellar populations from @xcite for instantaneous and continuous star formation , as well as the effect of extinction and hot dust .",
    "we have fitted models to the nuclear colours ( in a 1aperture ) , consisting of a reddened 100myr old stellar population and a hot dust component . except in the extreme case of a very young starburst @xmath22.5myr old  which is ruled out by the br@xmath4 equivalent width ",
    "the nuclear colour can not be reproduced by reddening stellar light . therefore including hot dust ( which contributes a fraction @xmath5 of the k - band emission ) is mandatory .",
    "but since its temperature can not be constrained from jhk colour data alone , we consider three particular cases : @xmath6=1500k is close to the sublimation temperature of grains is an upper limit , 1000k is intermediate , while 500k represents the coolest dust that can still significantly affect the k - band .",
    "with these we find that for @xmath6=1500k , @xmath5=0.59 and @xmath7=2.85 ; for @xmath6=1000k , @xmath5=0.49 and @xmath7=3.77 ; and for @xmath6=500k , @xmath5=0.50 and @xmath7=4.36 .",
    "the spectrum associated with each of these models is overplotted on a spectrum of the galaxy nucleus @xcite in fig  [ fig:2336spec2 ] .",
    "they show that the model matches the spectrum extremely well , and constrains the temperature of the dust emssion to be @xmath11000k .",
    "another spectrum of iras2336 in fig  [ fig:2336spec1 ] , discussed in more detail in @xcite , was extracted in a larger aperture and covers a longer wavelength range .",
    "the line emission shows none of the typical signs of an agn : the pa@xmath8 and br@xmath4 lines are narrow ( 300500kms@xmath9 ) , and there is no detectable coronal .",
    "here we have overplotted models similar to those above , but derived from colours extracted in 3  apertures ; the difference from the previous figure emphasises the importance of using consistent apertures when comparing different data .",
    "the model shown ( solid line ) uses @xmath6=1500k and matches the shape of the continuum quite well . to evaluate whether a model with no dust emission is feasible",
    ", we also show a pure stellar ( and nebula ) continuum with @xmath7=6 ( dotted line ) .",
    "although this provides a reasonable match to the spectra , it can be ruled out because its jh colour is too red by 0.32mags .",
    "thus in order to replicate both the jhk colours and the hk spectral shape , we find that a contribution to the k - band emission from dust at @xmath6@xmath11000k is required .",
    "in the k - band image in fig  [ fig:2021im ] ( resolution 0.48 ) , iras2021 has two nuclei with a ridge of emission between them .",
    "the jh - hk diagram shows that the colours of annuli centered on the north nucleus ( squares ) are consistent with a stellar population reddened by @xmath7@xmath31 .",
    "the circles denote the colours centered on the south nucleus ( classified as a seyfert  2 @xcite ) . as before , at radii larger than @xmath31.5  these are typical of a moderately reddened stellar population , but for the nucleus itself hot dust is required .",
    "fitting models to the colours of the south nucleus in a 1aperture yields : for @xmath6=1500k , @xmath5=0.70 and @xmath7=0.04 ; for @xmath6=1000k , @xmath5=0.60 and @xmath7=1.38 ; and for @xmath6=500k , @xmath5=0.60 and @xmath7=2.20 .",
    "although only 2 examples are presented in this contribution , we have looked at 8 nuclei in 6 ulirgs , the analysis of which is given in @xcite .",
    "for the sample as a whole , varying the age or metallicity of the stellar population does not affect the results much because , except for ages less than 1020myr , the jhk colours hardly change .",
    "it is although  and because  the stellar population can not be constrained , that the result we find here about significant hot dust emission being mandatory is robust .",
    "our results are similar to those found by @xcite .",
    "fig  [ fig:2021spec ] shows spectra for the southern nucleus of iras2021 ( see @xcite ) , which do exhibit typical signs of an agn : the pa@xmath8 is broad as expected for a narrow line region ( @xmath3700kms@xmath9 ) , and there is easily detectable   which is stronger than h@xmath10  1 - 0s(1 ) and even twice as strong as br@xmath4 .",
    "a model derived from the broadband colours as before ( but in a 2  aperture ) is over - drawn .",
    "it matches the continuum extremely well through both the h- and k - bands . as for iras2336",
    "we find that not only is a dust component required but that we can now constrain the temperature to be close to the top end of the permissible range , @xmath6@xmath11000k .",
    "an important question is whether the presence of dust at @xmath11000k implies an agn exists .",
    "typically , heating dust to its sublimation temperature requires a very intense uv radiation field that only occurs within a few parsecs of an agn , at the inner edge of a putative torus . indeed",
    ", iso spectroscopy of classic ` template ' starburst and agn galaxies @xcite suggests that it is only agn which have spectral shapes indicative of dust emission at these temperatures .",
    "however , the iso - sws 2.412@xmath11 m aperture is large enough to include a significant fraction of the more extended emission from a galaxy bulge or disk .",
    "so late - type stars could easily dominate the 2@xmath11 m emission observed by iso and hide any relatively weaker hot dust emission that might originate only in younger star clusters .",
    "evidence that stellar processes can produce dust hotter than 1000k arises from 3 reflection nebulae that were observed to have 25@xmath11 m  continua characterised by a colour temperature of @xmath31000k @xcite .",
    "this is explained in terms of stochastic heating of very small grains of radius 510  @xcite , with the result that the fraction of the dust mass in such grains is 0.002 , and the fraction of stellar luminosity absorbed and re - radiated by them is 0.004 of that absorbed and re - radiated by all grains . a simple calculation comparing the luminosities for dust emission at 2.2@xmath11 m  and 60@xmath11 m yields ratios of @xmath30.01 , consistent with this model .",
    "a possible problem with applying this model to ulirgs is that the reflection nebulae contain non - ionising stars ; whereas ulirgs must host significant numbers of ionising stars , from which the uv radiation could destroy very small grains and the thermal nebula emission could mask small grain emission . however , one plausible hypothesis for the star formation history in ulirgs is that individual star clusters ( or groups of clusters ) have formed in multiple episodes spread over a timescale of several 100myr  effectively continuous star formation . in such a scheme only the youngest clusters , in which star formation occured within the last 10myr , host ionising stars .",
    "most of the far - infrared luminosity still originates in these clusters through thermal heating of dust grains ; but the bulk of the starburst population resides in older clusters without hii  regions , and could have an observable small grain population .",
    "the 1000  luminosity of these 10100myr clusters is an order of magnitude greater than that at 2@xmath11 m , so there are enough energetic photons to heat the small grains and hence account for the equal contributions from dust and stars to the 2@xmath11 m emission .",
    "one could also speculate that in the turbulent environment expected in the nuclear region of a ulirg , grain destruction through shocks  via the merging process as well as the high supernova rate  cause an over - density of very small grains .",
    "thus it is certainly possible that in a ulirg the necessary prerequisits are met so that stochastic excitation of small grains becomes an observable phenomenon .",
    "as part of a larger study , we present an analysis which combines jhk imaging and hk spectroscopy of 2 ulirgs , one that harbours a seyfert  2 nucleus and one which shows none of the typical signs of an agn .",
    "the crucial result is that models of reddened star formation can not explain the jhk colours of the nuclei ; additional hot dust emission is needed .",
    "although the temperature is unconstrained by colours alone , comparison to the spectra show it is @xmath11000k .",
    "hot dust emission in the k - band is usually associated with the inner edge of a torus around an agn , but we have presented evidence that in ulirgs it could also arise through stochastic heating of very small grains by non - ionising stars .",
    "rid thanks the many people at the meeting , particularly j.  graham and m.  lehnert , who provided helpful input to this work .",
    "some of the data here were obtained as part of the ukirt service programme , and we thank all those who were involved .",
    "ukirt is operated by the jac on behalf of the u.k ."
