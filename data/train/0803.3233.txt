    "some of these generalizations are accommodated in a straightforward way , e.g. , the observable one generalizes @xmath271 . or for the state one goes to density operators @xmath272 so that the born probabilities   become @xmath273 .",
    "this can be done when the hamiltonian @xmath10 can be diagonalized , as is always the case for selfadjoint @xmath10 in the schwartz space with the basis system  ,   in  .",

    "jordan block matrices for non - hermitian hamiltonians have been discussed before , e.g.  @xcite , and were used for finite dimensional phenomenological expressions of the s - matrix  @xcite , but could not be implemented in the general framework of quantum mechanics using the hilbert space or the schwartz space axiom .    using the hardy space axiom",
    "the jordan - gamow vectors can be derived from the @xmath285-th order pole of the unitary s - matrix  @xcite in very much the same way as the ordinary gamow vectors were derived from the first order s - matrix pole  @xcite .",
    "the matrix of the hamiltonian @xmath96 has in the diagonal the complex eigenvalues @xmath298 of the 1st order pole position for the ordinary gamow kets .",
    "in addition it contains jordan blocks of jordan - gamow kets .",

    "each @xmath301 corresponds to the ordinary gamow ket  .",
    "and the @xmath302 matrix in the top left corner is the jordan block   of degree 2 .",

    "this means the 2nd order or @xmath285-th order pole of the s - matrix can no longer be described by a state vector , like the bound states by @xmath304 with real discrete eigenvalues , or the 1st order resonance states ( gamow states ) by @xmath305 with complex eigenvalue @xmath301 of the selfadjoint hamiltonian @xmath10 . instead , the state derived from the @xmath285-th order s - matrix pole is described by a non - diagonalizable density operator or state operator  @xcite @xmath306 where the operators @xmath307 are defined as @xmath308 the pole term of the @xmath285-th order s - matrix is associated with a sum   of the operators @xmath307 .",

    "the existence of this kind of representation for the causal spacetime translation group has already been mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a linear term in the time dependence for a 2nd order pole resonance @xmath310 in   has been well known for many years  @xcite . that such linear time - dependence has never been observed was used as an argument against the existence of higher order pole resonances  @xcite .",
    "this was a misconception because the state associated to the s - matrix pole is described by a state operator ( density matrix ) , which has an exponential time evolution , as we shall report now .",
    "the density operator or statistical operator of the state _ derived _ from the @xmath285-th order pole is given by  with  .",
    "it is remarkable that with the use of   one obtains after a complicated calculation a very simple result @xmath316 this result means that the complicated non - reducible ( i.e. , `` mixed '' ) microphysical state operator @xmath307 defined by   and has a simple and purely exponential semigroup time evolution , like the 0-th order gamow state  , and thus leads to the exponential law for the probabilities .",
    "the operators @xmath307 are probably the only operators formed by the dyadic products @xmath317 with @xmath318 , that have purely exponential time evolution . thus the operators @xmath307 , @xmath319 , are distinguished from all other operators in @xmath288 .",
    "the microphysical decaying state operator associated with the @xmath285-th order pole of the unitary s - matrix @xmath309 is the sum of these @xmath307 .",
    "because of the result   ( independence of the time evolution of @xmath320 ) this sum has again the simple , exponential time evolution @xmath321    thus , the theory that describes exponentially decaying states by gamow vectors   also admits the possibility of exponentially decaying states that are associated to s - matrix poles of @xmath285-th order at the position @xmath322 .",
    "the `` mixed '' state   associated to the @xmath323 order s - matrix pole also has an exponential time evolution .",
    "the probability to register an observable @xmath324 ( representing , e.g. , a detector ) in the state @xmath307 or @xmath309 is obtained using  or   as : @xmath325 these exponentially decaying states can not be described by a vector like @xmath326 .",
    "the simplest choice for this kind of state operator is the one associated to the pole term of a second order s - matrix pole at @xmath327 : @xmath328 in the subspaces @xmath329 associated to the @xmath285-th order pole , the hamiltonian @xmath10 is non - diagonalizable and so is the state operator .",
    "the hardy space theory , which was _ needed _ for the theoretical description of first order pole states ( by gamow vectors ) , also provides the mathematical means for higher order pole states described by non - diagonalizable operators ; this is not possible in the hilbert space or the schwartz space .",
    "this does not constitute a proof that these states exist in nature  higher order s - matrix poles may be excluded for some other physical reasons  but it provides a mathematical possibility , and it is an argument against the exclusion  @xcite of exponentially decaying higher order resonance states .",
