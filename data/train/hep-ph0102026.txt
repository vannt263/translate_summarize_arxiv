    "to familiarize the reader with our conventions and notations , we review in this section a number of well - known facts about polarized deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",

    "although we have electron - proton scattering in mind , our results are applicable to processes involving any charged lepton and any hadron .",
    "writing out the scattering amplitude , squaring , and summing over final states , one finds to leading order in @xmath26 that the cross - section factors into two pieces : @xmath27 where we have taken @xmath28 as the virtual photon momentum .",
    "@xmath29 is the electromagnetic current operator , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a tensor that depends only on the lepton spin and momentum .",

    "( [ tdef ] ) , the structure functions @xmath49 can in principle be calculated directly in feynman - dyson type perturbation theory .    in the bjorken limit , defined by taking @xmath50 while the ratio @xmath51 remains fixed , the physics involved in the structure functions becomes transparent because the asymptotic freedom of qcd @xcite simplifies the scattering mechanism immensely .",
    "well - defined relations emerge between the properties of the fundamental degrees of freedom  quarks and gluons  and the experimental data on the structure functions near this limit .",
    "the physical significance of the structure functions is made more apparant by introducing the scaling functions @xmath52 which remain finite in the bjorken limit .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath8 contains information about the polarized quark and gluon distributions . from eqs .",
    "( [ decomp ] , [ scaling ] ) , one finds that the structure function @xmath19 decouples from the scattering cross - section in the bjorken limit .",
    "hence its contribution is formally suppressed by a power of @xmath24 in comparison with @xmath53 . at tree - level in qcd , @xmath14 is not related to a simple parton distribution .",
    "rather , it contains information about quark - gluon correlations within the nucleon .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the effect of qcd corrections on the relation between @xmath14 and these interesting correlations .    at this point , it is convenient to choose the frame used most frequently in high - energy scattering . taking the 3-momenta of @xmath33 and @xmath28 parallel and along the @xmath54-direction , we write @xmath55 where the basis vectors @xmath56 and @xmath57 are defined by @xmath58 @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 is an arbitrary scale reflecting our remaining freedom to boost along the @xmath54-axis .",
    "note that this basis satisfies @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the limit @xmath64 ,",
    "one obtains the so - called infinite - momentum frame , in which feynman s parton model was originally formulated @xcite . in the context of qcd",
    ", this limit can serve as the basis for light - cone power counting , which we will discuss in detail in the next section .    along with two independent transverse vectors , @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 form a complete basis for lorentz vectors .",
    "hence _ any _ vector , @xmath65 , can be expressed in terms of them : @xmath66 in particular , the spin polarization , @xmath34 , has the form @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is an arbitrary vector in the 1- and 2-directions , normalized as @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the degree of longitudinal and transverse polarization , respectively , and are constrained by @xmath72 . in the limit @xmath64 ,",
    "the longitudinal polarization is leading since @xmath73 , whereas its transverse components are subleading since @xmath74 . taking @xmath75 ,",

    "more interestingly , it is @xmath76 which naturally appears in dis with a transversely polarized nucleon . for this reason",
    ", we will concern ourselves with this scaling function and the associated compton amplitude @xmath77 $ ] , rather than @xmath14 and @xmath78 .",
    "in this section , we present a general procedure to obtain perturbative qcd predictions for the structure functions in deep inelastic scattering , valid to all orders in @xmath17 and @xmath25 . for simplicity , we concern ourselves mainly with the forward compton amplitudes .",
    "this procedure involves several steps .",
    "first , one needs to express the amplitudes in terms of general parton correlations functions and perturbative scattering amplitudes .",
    "then a collinear expansion is used to simplify the classification of the contributions in terms of powers of @xmath17 . in the process ,",
    "the parton correlation functions become light - cone correlations which have definite power counting properties . at a particular order in @xmath24 ,",
    "certain classes of processes differing in the number of longitudinal gluons can be resummed to form gauge links extrapolating between spacially separated physical fields in our correlations .",
    "this process of resummation is greatly simplified by the choice of light - cone gauge in our calculations .",
    "once this choice is made , it becomes clear that only a finite number of gauge - invariant correlations can appear at each given order in @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficients of these correlations are themselves power series in the strong coupling , @xmath25 . as with most calculations in quantum field theory ,",
    "higher order terms in these expansions contain infinities which must be understood and properly handled if one is to obtain a sensible result .",
    "after all of these steps are understood , one arrives at a simple set of rules which can be used to calculate the contributions to inclusive dis at any order in @xmath24 and @xmath25 .      as @xmath79 , part of the deep - inelastic scattering process",
    "must be calculable in perturbation theory because of asymptotic freedom .",
    "on the other hand , the nucleon structure itself is surely non - perturbative .",
    "therefore , the compton amplitude @xmath80 contains physics both at hard scales , @xmath81 , and soft scales , @xmath82 . in the following discussion",
    ", we would like to separate the physics at these two scales . although most of the discussion in this subsection may be found in the literature , the way it is presented here is new and general .    as a first step of factorization",
    ", we consider the most general feynman diagrams consisting of a hard ( perturbative ) part representing scattering of a set of quarks and gluons with the photon , and a soft ( non - perturbative ) part representing the green s functions of these quarks and gluons in the presence of the nucleon , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . denote a collection of incoming ( with respect to the hard scattering ) quark momenta by @xmath83 , outgoing quark momenta by @xmath84 and gluon momenta by @xmath85 .",
    "the quark and gluon scattering amplitude can be expressed as @xmath86 where the subscript ` amp ' indicates that the external quark and gluon legs are truncated and the lorentz and dirac indices on gluon and quark fields are left open .",
    "the quark and gluon green s function in the presence of the nucleon is @xmath87 therefore , the full compton amplitudes can be written as @xmath88 where the coupling of lorentz and color indices between @xmath89 and @xmath90 is implied . for simplicity , we work with bare ( unrenormalized ) fields and couplings until the end of the calculation",
    ".    the contributions to @xmath80 can be classified in terms of powers of @xmath24 ( loosely speaking , a twist - expansion ) . unfortunately , however , @xmath24 power counting is not simply dimensional counting . conceptually , it is easy to understand because the transverse momentum of a parton , for instance , is less important than its longitudinal momentum in a hard scattering",
    ". we must take these relevant facts into account systematically through a new power counting scheme . to facilitate this counting",
    ", we make a collinear expansion of the  hard amplitude \" @xmath91 by writing @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and similarly for @xmath94 and @xmath95 . expanding all quark and gluon momenta about the collinear point @xmath96",
    ", we obtain @xmath97      [ \\cdots \\partial \\cdots ] m^{\\mu\\nu}(q ,       \\{x_ip\\ } , \\{x_j'p \\ } , \\{y_\\ell p\\})\\;\\ ; , \\label{expand}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have omitted all the lorentz indices which couple the partial derivatives with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . the leading term in the expansion can be interpreted as compton scattering off of several collinear onshell partons with feynman momentum fractions @xmath101 , etc .",
    "higher order terms take offshellness and non - collinear effects into account perturbatively .    rewriting all the quark and gluon momentum integrals in eq .",
    "( [ couple ] ) in terms of these variables , we can integrate out @xmath98 , etc .",
    "then the @xmath102-factors in eq .",
    "( [ expand ] ) become spatial derivatives on the quark and gluon fields in @xmath103 , which leads to @xmath104 the new correlations @xmath105 have field separations restricted to the light - cone @xmath57-direction in the coordinate space , and hence are called light - cone correlations : @xmath106 where again we have omitted the lorentz and color indices .",
    "now , we are ready to introduce light - cone power counting . the hard part in eq .",
    "( [ fac2 ] ) contains only two momenta , @xmath28 and @xmath56 , and the only dimensionful scalar in the absence of quark mass effects is @xmath107 .",
    "[ the effects of finite quark mass can be taken into account systematically , as explained in subsection 3e . ] on the other hand , the soft part depends on the scale @xmath18 . because there are lorentz indices that couple the soft and hard parts , @xmath24 power counting is not determined entirely by the dimension counting of the soft and hard part alone .",
    "instead we need a new type of power counting : light - cone power counting .",
    "since the @xmath80 has a fixed dimension , we can figure out @xmath24 counting by studying behavior of either the hard or the soft part . here",
    "we choose to examine the soft part .",
    "the light - cone correlation functions in the collinear expansion involve qcd fields and their derivatives .",
    "lorentz covariance requires that these objects be expressed in terms of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath68 .",
    "different @xmath24 powers result when these vectors are contracted with the hard partonic scattering amplitudes .",
    "note that the contractions of lorentz structures never produce any soft dimension because of the choice of the collinear coordinates .",
    "the balancing soft dimension in each term comes from the scalar coefficients of the expansion , taking into account @xmath110=1 $ ] , @xmath111=-1 $ ] and @xmath112=[\\epsilon]=[s_\\perp]=0 $ ] .",
    "because the dimension of the compton amplitude is fixed , the soft dimensions of the scalar coefficients determine the associated hard dimensions .",
    "obviously , the terms with the lowest soft dimension dominate the contribution .",
    "for example , if the soft and hard parts are connected by two - quark lines , we have the following light - cone correlation function : @xmath113\\ ] ] by dimensional counting , @xmath114=0 $ ] and @xmath115=2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the @xmath116 contribution to the hard scattering is leading and the @xmath117 contribution is suppressed by a factor of @xmath118 relative to @xmath116 .    the relation between counting the soft dimension and the use of the infinite - momentum frame is now easy to see . since @xmath119 , the contribution of the associated term is leading in the limit of @xmath120 . on the other hand , @xmath121 , so",
    "contributions associated with this vector are doubly suppressed .",
    "the lorentz structures spanning transverse dimensions are @xmath122 as @xmath120 .",
    "hence , their contributions are suppresed relative to the @xmath56 terms , but enhanced related to the @xmath57 type .",
    "this fact allows us to separately identify a certain power suppression for each field and derivative in the correlation function . for gluon fields",
    ", one has @xmath123 as required by the form of the covariant derivative , partial derivatives obey the same counting rules as gauge fields .",
    "now , we see why our power counting arguments can not be made until after the collinear expansion : subleading momentum components alter the form of the correlation functions , leading to an extra suppression . until this behavior",
    "is made explicit , our correlation functions do not have a definite power counting .",
    "an analysis of the quark bilinears , taking into account the fact that fermion fields have mass dimension 3/2 , leads to @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 means either 1 or @xmath127 .",
    "these relations can be simplified by breaking the quark field into two parts : @xmath128 and writing simply @xmath129 the suppression associated with an arbitrary correlation function is simply the sum of the suppressions associated with its constituent fields and derivatives minus two for the external nucleon states .",
    "a general light - cone correlation @xmath90 is the nucleon matrix element of an operator with @xmath130 @xmath131 fields , for @xmath132 , and @xmath133 partial derivatives , for @xmath134 . according to the above discussion",
    ", its soft dimension is given by @xmath135 armed with this formula , we can immediately determine the order at which a particular correlation function enters our amplitudes .",
    "for instance , the leading contribution to dis comes from correlations with either two @xmath136 or two @xmath137 correlations with arbitrary number of @xmath138 .    for polarized dis with transverse polarization ,",
    "the leading contribution is of order @xmath24 .",
    "the possible field combinations at this order are @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , each appearing with an arbitrary number of @xmath145 s . for each of these correlations ,",
    "we need to consider all possible feynman diagrams with corresponding external legs .",
    "the momenta entering these legs are all collinear .",
    "as we have seen in the last subsection , the longitudinal gauge potential , @xmath145 , in light - cone correlations does not lead to any suppression in its contribution to scattering amplitudes . at",
    "any given order in @xmath24 , an infinite set of correlations with increasing number of @xmath145 s contribute .",
    "a related problem is that of gauge - invariance .",
    "the correlations that naturally appear in the collinear expansion are not manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "in particular , the spatially separated fields do not form gauge - invariant operators without appropriate gauge links .",
    "the appearance of gauge potentials also poses a gauge - invariance problem since these objects do no transform covariantly under the action of the gauge group .",
    "as we have mentioned before , the parton scattering amplitudes @xmath89 are calculated with external collinear and on - shell parton states after collinear expansion .",
    "as such , they are separately gauge invariant . since the compton amplitudes are gauge invariant order by order in @xmath24 , all correlations at a given order must combine in such way to yield gauge invariant parton distributions .",
    "gluon potentials and partial derivatives do not transform covariantly under the gauge group , so they must combine to form either covariant derivatives or field strength tensors .    in this subsection",
    ", we argue that the infinite number of correlations must be combined into a finite number of gauge - invariant parton distributions .",
    "in particular , the correlations with increasing numbers of @xmath145 s form gauge - invariant structures with gauge links connecting fields at separate spacetime points .",
    "this conclusion is , of course , well - known in the case of leading twist @xcite .",
    "we assert that it is in fact true order by order in @xmath24 .",
    "let us recall the argument of gauge - link formation in the leading twist case .",
    "consider a class of diagrams with a number of @xmath145 gluons connecting the soft and hard parts . as we stated above ,",
    "the hard part is already gauge invariant and can be calculated in any gauge one likes . using ward identities derived from the gauge symmetry , one factorizes all the longitudinal gluon lines connected to the hard scattering blob onto eikonal lines .",
    "these eikonal lines represent the gauge links .",
    "to prove this fact , one refers to the proof of factorization by collins , soper and sterman in ref .",
    "@xcite . at leading order in @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ", this process is especially easy to see . collecting the contributions from the diagrams in fig .",
    "2 , one obtains @xmath146 for illustrative purposes , we take @xmath40 in the transverse dimensions and simplify the dirac algebra . giving @xmath147 a small negative imaginary part and performing the integrals over the @xmath148 , we obtain @xmath149 the quantity in brackets is precisely the gauge link required to make this distribution gauge - invariant .    at higher orders in the @xmath24 expansion",
    ", we have more fields and this process of resummation becomes more complicated .",
    "however , at any given order in @xmath24 , there is only a finite number of @xmath137 and @xmath150 according to power counting .",
    "these potentials require only a finite number of @xmath145 s and partial derivatives to form gauge covariant quantities .",
    "therefore the infinite number of remaining @xmath145 s must form gauge - covariant objects by themselves .",
    "one can easily see by inspection that this can only be achieved if they form gauge links .",
    "once done , we are left with a finite number of correlations with gauge links .",
    "after an infinite number of longitudinal gluons have been resummed to form the gauge links , the remainder must combine with the partial derivatives and the @xmath137 and @xmath150 fields to form fully gauge - invariant distributions .",
    "this means that they must organize into covariant derivatives and field strength tensors .",
    "although difficult to prove , this fact is a direct consequence of gauge invariance .",
    "it can be used as a check of any explicit calculation .    in a practical calculation",
    ", the presence of the longitudinal gluons represents an unncessary complication . the standard approach to avoiding",
    "this is to make the choice of light - cone gauge @xmath151 .",
    "although a gauge choice here is not required since we are not making perturbative calculations of the correlations , it represents a tremendous simplification . in this gauge",
    ", no correlations involving @xmath145 are ever needed and the gauge links simply reduce to unity .",
    "the only complication comes at the end of the calculation , when we would like to organize the correlations in the axial gauge into manifestly gauge invariant ones .    as a last point in this subsection",
    ", we mention that not all the correlations that one can write down according to the light - cone power counting above are independent .",
    "the so - called ` bad ' field components , @xmath152 and @xmath150 , are related to the ` good ' components , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , through the qcd equations of motion : @xmath153 where we have introduced the covariant derivative @xmath154 in the light - cone gauge , we can solve this equation for the ` bad ' quark field component in terms of the ` good ' one : @xmath155 similarly , one has @xmath156 from the gluon equation of motion .",
    "the above equations are consistent with the light - cone power counting of the previous subsection . in both cases , we see that the ` bad ' components , @xmath152 and @xmath150 , can be eliminated in favor of either two ` good ' fields , @xmath136 or @xmath137 , or one ` good ' field and a transverse momentum insertion .",
    "this follows from the fact that in light - cone quantization , ` bad ' field components do not propagate freely and hence can not be directly interpreted in feynman - dyson type perturbation theory . as a consequence",
    ", we can choose independent correlations without inclusion of any `` bad '' fields .",
    "as an example of formalism presented above , we consider the leading contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "this example is useful not only as a simple illustration of the procedure , but also to familiarize the reader with some of the distributions that appear in dis with transverse polarization . to simplify the discussion , we contract one of the photon polarizations with @xmath57",

    "next , amplitudes with two ` bad ' field components must be considered .",
    "this process continues until we have exhausted all possible ways to obtain a suppression of @xmath216 . in general",

    "( [ badq],[badg ] ) , we could choose to eliminate the ` bad ' components in the beginning of the calculation .",
    "in this scheme , some diagrams representing processes that occur entirely either before or after the hard scattering , such as figs . 4@xmath220 and @xmath221 ( but not @xmath222 ) , are reinstated .",
    "rules for the onshell couplings and propagators that appear in these special diagrams are derived directly from the equations of motion .",
    "this procedure is used in refs .",
    "@xcite . throughout the rest of this paper , however , we opt for the former method .    the dependence of @xmath28 on the nucleon mass @xmath223 through @xmath59 ( eqs .",
    "( [ 10],[11 ] ) ) prompts us to replace @xmath224 in @xmath59 before each expansion .",
    "this produces additional suppression of certain correlations , but does not significantly alter the above analysis because its effects can always be grouped into the physical vector @xmath28 . if quark mass effects are desired , one has only to replace @xmath225 with @xmath226 in eq .",
    "( [ badq ] ) , consider @xmath227 in the amplitudes , and expand as before .",
    "we note here that these expansions may be asymptotic in nature and can not be used to predict experiment to arbitrary precision because of the problems presented by infrared renormalons @xcite .",
    "armed with the formalism presented in the last section , we are ready to study the main subject of the paper : one - loop corrections to the @xmath228 scaling function . as we have explained before ,",
    "it is the compton amplitude @xmath157 that is a natural object to calculate in feynman - dyson perturbation theory ; we focus on it exclusively throughout this section .",
    "part of the results here have already appeared in our previous publications @xcite . more details are given here for the reader s convenience .",
    "the non - singlet sector requires at least two quark fields , so the correlation functions we need to consider are exactly the same as those in section 3c . before we begin , however , some comments are in order .    as with most quantum loop - corrections , our calculation contains divergences . as explained above eq .",
    "( [ 52 ] ) , these divergences are of infrared origin after usual renormalization and can be combined with the bare distributions to generate a finite , scale - dependent renormalized distribution .",
    "working in dimensional regularization , one can isolate these divergences and obtain a relation between the renormalized and bare distributions .",
    "this relation allows us to determine the @xmath107 evolution of @xmath229 and check the validity of factorization for our process . of course , in order to use dimensional regularization to calculate a spin - dependent quantity , one must specify a prescription for @xmath127 and @xmath44 . in this paper , we choose  t hooft and veltman s prescription @xcite .    in principle , to obtain the full amplitude one must calculate all relevent feynman diagrams .",
    "however , loops associated exclusively with external legs can be grouped into renormalization @xmath210-factors for the external fields .",
    "the absence of a physical scale at the massless poles of the physical external propagators reduces these factors to unity .",
    "in addition , when both photon indices are left open , fundamental symmetries allow one to reduce the number of diagrams that actually need to be calculated .",

    "the freedom to exchange @xmath159 and @xmath231 is destroyed by our asymmetric treatment of these indices .",
    "however , we know that the part of the amplitude we search for is antisymmetric in @xmath159 and @xmath231 , so we can obtain the full result simply by calculating all diagrams with a certain ordering of photon insertions and subtracting @xmath232 in the end .",
    "although these diagrams are not all independent when photon indices are left open , they represent the minimal set of independent contributions to our calculation .    by inspection , one can see that there are four diagrams associated with @xmath233 , sixteen associated with @xmath234 , and eight with @xmath235 .",
    "these diagrams can easily be grouped according to color factor .",
    "all of the diagrams associated with @xmath236 and @xmath235 are proportional to @xmath237 in su@xmath238 , while those representing @xmath234 also include the factors @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "routing the transverse momentum through the quark line and performing the collinear expansion @xmath241 before evaluation , we see that the four ( 2,0 ) graphs actually represent twelve contributions , each with an insertion of the operator @xmath242 , where the partial derivative acts on the external quark field .",
    "each of these contributions corresponds to a similar graph in which the operator insertion is replaced by a gluon line .",
    "the only differences between these contributions are the change in momentum induced by a gluon absorption and the associated gauge group generator .",
    "since the generator contributes only to the color factor , the @xmath236 contribution is simply the @xmath243-part of the @xmath234 contribution evaluated at zero momentum transfer , i.e. @xmath244 .",
    "this implies that the sum of @xmath236 and @xmath234 is obtained by replacing @xmath245 with @xmath246 in the @xmath243-part of @xmath234 .",

    "the contributions to @xmath236 are calculated according to the prescription mentioned before .",
    "we send a small amount of transverse momentum into the quark loop through the incoming gluon and remove it through the outgoing . internal propagators which carry this momentum are then broken successively by the operator @xmath277 .",
    "since we have a loop , we are given a choice of which way to route the momentum .",
    "either choice must yield the same result , so we immediately have a set of relations among diagrams .",

    "however , a more careful analysis brings a quite different result .",
    "the first step in a systematic approach to this problem lies in identifying and separating out the twist - two part of our amplitude . since we know that partial derivative terms belong exclusively to this part of the amplitude",
    ", we can use them as a guide once more .",

    "this suggests that separating the twist - two contribution , whose gauge invariance and locality are not in question , from the amplitude _ before _ worrying about the issues of gauge invariance may lead us to the correct understanding of our result .    in order to perform a straightforward separation , it is advantageous for us to write the three - gluon part of our amplitude in such a way that the bosonic symmetry is evident .",
    "as we have seen above , forgetting this symmetry can easily lead to incorrect conclusions . to this end , we define the local operator @xmath352 and re - write our twist - two operator in terms of it : @xmath353 this equation is valid modulo total derivatives .",

    "stated another way , the twist - two contribution to this expansion is independent of the kinematics associated with the matrix elements we choose to take . from this point of view , one expects this behavior at all orders of perturbation theory . inverting the mellin transform ,",
    "one obtains the functional relationship @xcite @xmath372 which must be satisfied if the operator product expansion is truly well - defined .",
    "although we have managed twist separation for the individual moments of the structure function , it is natural to ask if this separation can be done in term of the correlation functions themselves .",
    "this procedure would allow us to express @xmath373 in terms of twist - two distributions , for example .",
    "the most straightforward way of achieving this involves a simple resummation of the separate contributions to eqs .",
    "( [ stquark],[thisone ] ) . however , a quick glance at their form is more than enough to motivate us to find another way .",

    "however , it is quite easy to construct functions whose expansions display the symmetries of a given twist .",
    "for example , the form of the non - singlet twist - two operator ( [ tw2q ] ) implies that for any function @xmath374 analytic in a region about the origin , the function @xmath375 will lead exclusively to twist - two local operators upon convolution with @xmath229 .",
    "similarly , it is obvious from our operator basis ( [ basisq ] ) that for any function @xmath292 that is regular at @xmath244 , the function @xmath376 will lead exclusively to twist - three local operators upon convolution with @xmath229 .",
    "this fact is especially useful since it allows us to isolate the part of our amplitude which does not vanish as @xmath248 into a function only of @xmath253 , with corrections that contribute directly to the twist - three kernel : @xmath377 now , we need only construct a way to separate the twist - two and -three contributions to a function only of @xmath253 .    in the non - singlet sector , this separation is quite straightforward .",
    "since convoluting pure powers of @xmath253 with @xmath229 generates moments of @xmath23 , one finds that the expression @xmath378 separates the twist - two and -three components of @xmath379 .",
    "this can be translated into a functional relationship quite easily : @xmath380 hence for any kernel @xmath381 in the non - singlet sector , the twist - two and -three parts are given by @xmath382 respectively , where @xmath383    while conceptually simple , this functional separation is practically quite complicated .",
    "as an example , we examine the leading order . here , @xmath384 which leads to @xmath385 obviously , one can separate the kernel ( [ resultns ] ) in a similar way . however ,",
    "the result of such a manipulation is extremely complicated and not very illuminating ; it will not be presented here .",
    "the advantage of performing this separation is that we can explicitly replace @xmath229 with the simple distribution @xmath386 in our expression for @xmath387 . since @xmath388 one",
    "can write @xmath389 more generally , for any kernel @xmath381 in the non - singlet sector , the twist - two part can be written @xmath390 where @xmath391 is given above .    in the singlet sector , the separation is spoiled by the presence of @xmath350 in eq .",
    "( [ twist2 g ] ) .",
    "this makes it impossible for us to express the twist - two gluon operator in terms of @xmath392 .",
    "one can circumnavigate this problem by introducing the singlet quark distribution . examining the twist - two gluon operator ( [ twist2 g ] ) , we see that @xmath393 for @xmath207 even . in analogy with the non - singlet sector",

    "however , due to the form of that result , such manipulations are better left for numerical analysis .",
    "we have presented a systematic way to obtain radiative corrections to the power - suppressed terms in inclusive deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "this method is quite general and can be applied to other factorizable processes such as deeply - virtual compton scattering and drell - yan scattering with few changes .    using this method ,",
    "we have calculated the next - to - leading order corrections to the compton amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "this result allows us to derive an expression for the operator product expansion of two electromagnetic currents separated along the light - cone valid to twist - three and @xmath0 .",
    "our results show that the wandzura - wilczek relation between @xmath318 and the twist - two part of @xmath228 is valid to this order and the form of the expansion indicates its validity to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the large-@xmath6 simplification of the evolution of @xmath262 does not extend to its coefficient function at next - to - leading order .",
    "the general distributions @xmath263 enter nontrivially even in this limit .",
    "it would be interesting to apply our method to higher twist processes .",
    "in particular , ignoring interactions in the nuclear wavefunction , certain nuclear twist - four matrix elements can be factorized into the product of two nucleonic twist - two distributions . in view of recent data from rhic , corrections to these processes may allow us to clearly determine the changes in parton distributions induced by the nuclear medium .",
