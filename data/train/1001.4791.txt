    "the important structural unit of the high temperature copper - oxide superconductors is the `` cuo@xmath2 plane '' and the important electronic orbitals are believed to be the cu @xmath3 and o @xmath4 states .",
    "superconductors are formed by doping ( adding carriers to ) an insulating parent compound .",
    "the nominal electronic configuration of the insulating parent compound is cu @xmath5 ( one hole in @xmath6 band ) o @xmath7 ( oxygen @xmath8-band completely full ) , although of course cu - o hybridization means that some fraction of the hole delocalizes onto the o. however , the strong correlations characteristic of the cu @xmath9 orbitals implies that the energy required to add a second hole on the cu site is very large , @xmath10ev@xcite so that at low doping levels , doped holes go primarily onto the oxygen site , but are strongly coupled via an exchange interaction to the holes on the cu sites , forming `` zhang - rice singlets''.@xcite while this picture is qualitative , being strictly valid only in the strong coupling limit and low doping limits , it has provided a useful guide for thinking about the materials .",
    "an important open question concerns the doping at which this picture breaks down .",
    "oxygen @xmath0-edge x - ray absorption spectra provides an interesting test of the zhang - rice picture , and more generally of our understanding of the three - band model . in these experiments absorption of an incident photon",
    "promotes an electron from the oxygen @xmath11 shell to an unoccupied oxygen orbital ; if the photon energy is appropriately tuned , the final states are in the energy range of the o @xmath12 manifold and the spectrum reveals the energy distribution of the unoccupied o @xmath12 states ( modified by the excitonic core - hole / excited state interactions ) .",
    "experiments performed in the early 1990s@xcite on insulating and lightly - doped samples la@xmath13sr@xmath14cuo@xmath15 ( lsco ) revealed a two - peak structure , with a higher energy peak visible in both insulating and hole - doped materials and a lower energy peak , visible only in hole doped compounds .",
    "the integrated spectral weight of the lower energy feature was found to increase linearly with doping ( at low hole - dopings ) whereas the integrated spectral weight of the higher energy feature was found to decrease.@xcite for this reason the higher energy peak was interpreted as the `` upper hubbard band '' , while the lower energy feature was interpreted as the `` zhang - rice band '' .",
    "a recent experiment@xcite has extended the measurements to a wider range of compounds and in particular to a wider range of hole dopings .",
    "[ zr ] summarizes the data , showing the recent measurements as `` x''-shaped crosses with errorbars and the previous data@xcite as plus signs .",
    "a remarkable finding of the recent measurements is that the oxygen weight in the feature interpreted as the zhang - rice band saturates as doping is increased beyond the optimal doping value which maximizes the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "ref .   interpreted this finding as a breakdown of the zhang - rice singlet picture .    motivated by these experiments , in this paper we use a more modern theoretical technique , namely single - site dynamical mean - field theory @xcite to compute the oxygen @xmath0-edge x - ray absorption spectra implied by the standard three - band copper - oxygen model of high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductors .",
    "the model contains the physics of zhang - rice singlets at low doping and strong correlations , but for higher doping or weaker correlations the behavior becomes band - like .",
    "we have examined the model both at strong coupling , where the state at half filling is a charge - transfer insulator@xcite and the physics at low doping is of zhang - rice singlets , and at weaker correlation strength , where antiferromagnetism is needed to make the model insulating at half filling and the appropriateness of the zhang - rice picture is less clear .",
    "we find that in both cases the model reproduces the low doping behvior but qualitatively fails to reproduce the experimental data at higher doping.@xcite we conclude that if the experiment indeed measures the oxygen density of states without other complicating effects , then the data indicate not just a failure of the zhang - rice model but a breakdown of the entire three - band model picture , with some additional orbital , not included in the three - band model , becoming important .",
    "an additional consequence of our work is that by comparing the energies of the `` zhang - rice band '' and `` upper hubbard band '' features to our calculations we are able to estimate the correlation strength of the materials .",
    "the comparison places the materials on the metallic side of the metal / charge - transfer - insulater phase diagram , in agreement with previous work.@xcite    the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ model ] describes the three - band model to be studied and the methods . in section [ result ]",
    "we present the numerical results .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is a conclusion and discussion .",
    "the three - band emery model considers cu @xmath3 and o @xmath4 orbitals,@xcite which hybridize via a copper - oxygen hopping @xmath16 . we shall also consider oxygen - oxygen hoppings , adopting the form implied by the considerations of ref .  .",
    "the model exhibits both a low - doping antiferromagnetic phase and a high - doping paramagnetic phase but because the experimentally interesting behavior occurs at high dopings , we restrict our attention in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "we distinguish the oxygen sites displaced from the cu in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions , adopt the basis @xmath19 , introduce the copper - oxygen hopping @xmath20 and oxygen - oxygen hopping @xmath21 in the form proposed by andersen;@xcite we compare @xmath22 and @xmath23.@xcite the interaction part of the hamiltonian is @xmath24 and in the calculation presented here we take @xmath25 ( the precise value of @xmath26 is not important as long as it is larger than about @xmath27 ) .",
    "the band theoretic part of the hamiltonian may be represented as a @xmath28 matrix :    @xmath29    the model has two important parameters : @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "the physically relevant case is large @xmath26 , in which case the model is in the charge - transfer regime @xcite and the physics is controlled by the ratio of @xmath31 to the copper - oxygen hopping @xmath16 . at `` half filling '' ( one hole in the @xmath9-@xmath8 complex ) the single - site dynamical mean - field approximation predicts that the model exhibits a paramagnetic insulating phase for small @xmath31 whereas the paramagnetic phase is metallic at large @xmath31 . in previous work@xcite we have determined that for @xmath25 , @xmath32 is on the insulating side , but not far from the metal - insulator phase boundary , whereas @xmath33 lies on the metallic side of the phase diagram , but also not far from the boundary .",
    "the correct value of @xmath31 for the cuprates is controversial@xcite ; we therefore consider @xmath31-values corresponding both to paramagnetic metal and to paramagnetic insulating phases at half filling .",
    "the model is solved using the single - site dynamical mean - field approximation,@xcite in which the key approximation is a momentum - independent self - energy : @xmath34 where @xmath35 indicates real or matsubara frequencies .",
    "the green s function is @xmath36 and the spectral functions ( density of states ) of @xmath9 and @xmath8 orbitals are obtained from the imaginary part of the diagonal elements of the green s function matrix .",
    "we employ two impurity solvers : exact diagonalizations ( ed)@xcite and the hybridization - expansion continuous - time quantum monte carlo method ( qmc)@xcite . because the two methods involve different approximations , comparison of the results helps confirm the accuracy of the methods",
    ". analytic continuation of the qmc data is performed using the method described in ref .  .",
    "the model has been previously studied:@xcite at strong correlations and low dopings the approximation reveals the `` zhang - rice singlet '' behavior with doped holes residing on the oxygen but strongly antiferromagnetically coupled to spins on the copper sites . as the doping is increased or the effective correlation strength decreased , the behavior reverts to moderately - correlated band behavior and a zhang - rice picture becomes inappropriate .",
    "from the calculation we obtain the electron spectral function @xmath37 which we use to model the x - ray absorption experiment . as noted in ref .",
    ", the x - ray absorption cross section is not simply proportional to the product of a matrix element and electron spectral function because the hole in the oxygen @xmath11 core state interacts with the excited electron . we assume , following ref .   that this effect provides a constant ( hartree ) shift of the spectrum , and in particular has a negligible effect on the lineshape and on spectral weight .",
    "therefore the x - ray absorption spectrum is given by @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the calculated electron spectral function , projected onto the oxygen site , @xmath40 $ ] is the complement of the fermi function , restricting the result to unoccupied states , @xmath41 encodes the matrix element and @xmath42 is the energy difference between the final and initial state , including the effect of the excitonic interaction between the core hole and the excited electron . in our calculations we set @xmath42 for 0.1 hole doping case such that the upper hubbard band peaks at @xmath43.@xcite the @xmath42 for other doping values are computed by adding a hartree shift to the 0.1 hole - doped case , using the hamiltonian and parameters described by ref .   with the calculated occupation numbers .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    fig .",
    "[ tppzero ] shows the doping dependence of the electron spectral functions , calculated as described above and projected onto the oxygen orbitals , for @xmath32 ( insulator in undoped case ) and @xmath44 ( metal in undoped case ) , in absence of @xmath21 .",
    "results obtained from both analytic continuation of qmc and ed impurity solvers are shown ; the close correspondence between the results of the two methods indicates that the solution of the model is reliable .",
    "two features are evident in the calculated spectra : a higher energy feature which corresponds to the upper hubbard band ( its weight is small because this band is comprised mainly of @xmath9-states so it has a small projection onto the oxygen states ) and a lower energy feature corresponding to the zhang - rice band . the difference in energy between the two features is an estimate of the correlation gap in the system .",
    "one sees that the gap size is about @xmath44 in the @xmath32 ( insulator in undoped case ) case , and around @xmath45 in @xmath33 ( metal in undoped case ) case , and we expect the gap will further shrink if we go deeper in the metallic phase of the paramagnetic phase diagram .",
    "experiments @xcite show that the observed gap between the two peaks is @xmath46 , which is more consistent with the @xmath33 results , in agreement with our previously published papers@xcite placing the cuprates on the paramagnetic metal side of the phase diagram , so that the correlations are intermediate rather than strong .",
    "[ tpp1p1 ] shows results for the case @xmath22 obtained from analytic continuation of the qmc data for the unoccupied oxygen density of states .",
    "the similarity of these curves to the results shown in fig  [ tppzero ] indicates that oxygen - oxygen hopping does not have an important effect on the results .",
    "we have integrated the area in the lower energy feature shown in figs .",
    "[ tppzero ] and [ tpp1p1 ] , normalized the results to the value at hole doping @xmath47 and have plotted the resulting spectral weight as diamonds etc . in fig .",
    "[ zr ] . for both values of @xmath31 the integrated spectral weight is found to increase linearly with doping over a wide doping range .",
    "differences between the @xmath32 case ( strong correlation , doped charge - transfer insulator ) and the @xmath33 case ( intermediate correlation , charge - transfer metal ) appear only at low dopings @xmath48 . for completeness we present also in fig .",
    "[ uhb ] the integrated oxygen weight in the upper hubbard band .",
    "we see that the spectral weight of the zhang - rice band continue to increase at the overdoped region , while the weight of the upper hubbard band decreases . both the weight in the zhang - rice band and the weight in the upper hubbard band vary smoothly with doping for all parameters .",
    "the sharp break in the data is not observed in the calculation for any choice of parameters .",
    "we therefore conclude that the experimental paper understated the significance of the results : the data indicate not just a breakdown of the zhang - rice picture , but a failure of the three - band model itself .",
    "in this paper we have used single - site dynamical mean - field theory to study the emery three - band copper - oxide model related to the cuprates .",
    "we have calculated the doping dependence of the intensity of oxygen @xmath0-edge x - ray absorption spectra . at high doping , our calculations does not reproduce the results of a recent experiment ( ref .  ) .",
    "this implies a breakdown of `` zhang - rice singlet '' approximation and even a failure of the entire three - band model picture .",
    "we may speculate on the reason for the failure of the three - band model in the overdoped regime .",
    "one possibility is that the electronic structure changes in such a way that new degrees of freedom ( beyond the conventionally studied copper @xmath6 and oxygen @xmath49 ) states become important ( for example other states in the @xmath9-multiplet or apical oxygen states ) providing a new channel for adding doped holes .",
    "an alternative possibility might be that for some reason the arguments relating the experimental measurement to the oxygen density of states break down , or that there is an unusual change in the matrix element .",
    "such a change would presumably be related to a change in the electronic structure .",
    "a third possibility is that additional physics , such as a @xmath50 on the oxygen states , begins to play a role ; however it is not clear why this would lead to a sudden change in doping dependence .",
    "the effect of additional orbitals is presently under investigation .",
