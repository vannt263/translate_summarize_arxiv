    "<S> utf8bsmi    the recent discovery  @xcite of monolayer fese grown on a srtio@xmath1 substrate is among the most significant in the field of fe based superconductors . in general fese films </S>",
    "<S> play an important role for spectroscopies as pure fese is hard to grow as single crystals and hard to cleave along the fe plane  @xcite . by employing a se etching technique , </S>",
    "<S> in which the srtio@xmath1 substrate is smoothened by bombarding it with se , a fese film was grown to be as thin as a single monolayer@xcite . a subsequent annealing procedure </S>",
    "<S> was furthermore found by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) to induce a superconducting gap that is roughly an order of magnitude larger than in bulk fese  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large gap was also confirmed with arpes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct measurement of the transition temperature @xmath2 via transport remains difficult due to the large conductivity of the srtio@xmath1 substrate induced by the se etching treatment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , a crude estimate based on the gap value led to the exciting conclusion  @xcite that the @xmath2 in the fese monolayer could be as high as the liquid nitrogen boiling temperature of 77k .    from a fundamental science point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the fese monolayer also has the potential of being a model system for the fe based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> its two dimensional structure ( without the complication of phase separation like in k@xmath3fe@xmath4se@xmath5  @xcite ) could simplify the theoretical and experimental analysis and help to identify the essential tuning parameters of the superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> one point of view  @xcite is that the high dielectric constant of the srtio@xmath1 substrate plays a crucial role . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on the fact that no dramatic @xmath2 increase is observed when the much less polarizible bilayer graphene substrate is employed  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a combined functional renormalization group and eliashberg calculation  @xcite indeed indicated that the dielectric phonons in srtio@xmath1 can enhance the @xmath2 by screening the repulsive interactions in the fese monolayer . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the significantly enlarged in - plane lattice constant of the monolayer caused by the srtio@xmath1 substrate is argued  @xcite to be responsible for the high @xmath2 in the fese monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> of course yet another essential tuning parameter to consider is the doping .    while fese is expected to be a compensated semimetal , arpes measurements  @xcite surprisingly revealed a strongly electron doped fermi surface , consisting only of electron pockets , reminiscent of the fermi surface of k@xmath3fe@xmath4se@xmath5  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly it was shown  @xcite that the same annealing procedure which induces the superconductivity is also responsible for the strong electron doping . by systematically performing arpes measurements in different stages of the annealing </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the hole pocket systematically vanishes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to explain the origin of the post - annealing induced electron doping two scenarios have been proposed  @xcite . either the electron doping is induced by se vacancies in the fese monolayer or by oxygen vacancies in the srtio@xmath1 substrate . in previous density functional theory ( dft ) </S>",
    "<S> studies , the effects of oxygen vacancies  @xcite , magnetism  @xcite and electric field  @xcite have been considered . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> there have been numerous reports on the occurrence of se vacancies in iron selenides  @xcite . given their high volatility , </S>",
    "<S> se anions could easily evaporate during the post - annealing procedure . </S>",
    "<S> such se vacancies should be expected to electron dope the fe bands strongly as they are located in the fese plane . for the same reason </S>",
    "<S> , they should also strongly scatter the fe-@xmath0 carriers . </S>",
    "<S> this is highly relevant because disorder itself can induce large effective dopings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore timely to study the influence of disordered se vacancies on the fese monolayer .    in this rapid communication </S>",
    "<S> we investigate from first principles the doping effect of disordered se vacancies in monolayer fese . </S>",
    "<S> we find that se vacancies pull a vacancy centered orbital consisting of a symmetric superposition of the surrounding fe-@xmath6 orbitals below the fermi energy that absorbs most of the doped electrons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we find that the disorder induced broadening induces an effective hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> the surprising net result is that se vacancies in terms of the fe-@xmath0 bands behave like hole dopants rather than electron dopants . </S>",
    "<S> our results rule out se vacancies to be the origin of the large electron pockets measured by arpes . </S>",
    "<S> the counter - intuitive doping effects found in our study also give new insight in the debated role of anion vacancies in the iron based superconductors , and illustrate the rich behavior of vacancies in materials in general .    </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of a disordered system is given by the configuration - averaged spectral function : @xmath7=@xmath8 of wannier orbital  @xcite @xmath9 , crystal momentum @xmath10 and frequency @xmath11 , in which an equal probability is assumed among the configurations . by treating the disordered configurations within the supercell approximation , </S>",
    "<S> their spectral functions @xmath12 can be obtained directly from the supercell eigenvectors and eigenvalues , using the unfolding method  @xcite . to handle the computational cost related to the large sizes of the supercells , essential for a proper treatment of the disorder </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the recently developed wannier function based effective hamiltonian method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy hilbert space is taken in the range [ -7,3]ev consisting of the wannier orbitals of fe-@xmath0 and se-@xmath13 characters . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a vacancy centered orbital of symmetric superposition of the surrounding fe-@xmath6 orbitals is included . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the se vacancies is extracted from two dft  @xcite calculations : the clean fe@xmath5se@xmath5 and the single vacancy supercell fe@xmath14se@xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the srtio@xmath1 substrate is not included in the dft calculations since it was found  @xcite to have no significant influence on the bands near the fermi surface . to mimic the annealing - induced evaporation of the se atoms only se vacancies on one side of the fe plane are considered . for the configurational average </S>",
    "<S> , we use 10 large supercells ( e.g. fig.[fig : fig2](a ) ) of random size , shape and orientation containing 150 atoms on average . </S>",

    "<S> atomic images are produced by the xcrysden program  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) unfolded bandstructure of the fe@xmath16se@xmath17 monolayer supercell with the vacancy centered fe-@xmath6 ( vcfs ) intensity enhanced by a factor of 10 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) isosurface ( 0.05 bohr@xmath18 ) of the vcfs orbital . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we start by considering the influence of a single se vacancy . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the bandstructure of the small fe@xmath14se@xmath15 supercell shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the first thing we note is that there are 41 bands within the [ -3,3]ev range consisting of @xmath19 fe-@xmath0 bands leaving one band unaccounted for . </S>",
    "<S> apparently the se vacancy pulls an extra band into the fe-@xmath0 band complex . by applying the projected wannier function method  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we find that the extra band has the character of a bonding molecular orbital formed by the four fe-@xmath6 orbitals that surround the se vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this molecular orbital as the vacancy centered fe-@xmath6 ( vcfs ) orbital . from the vcfs wannier function plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](b ) we see that most of its weight is located below the se vacancy site where the four neighboring fe-@xmath6 orbitals interfere constructively . </S>",
    "<S> so why would a se vacancy pull this fe-@xmath6 like orbital down into the fe-@xmath0 band complex ? </S>",
    "<S> after all , the fe-@xmath6 orbitals in fese , like many outer shell transition metal @xmath6 orbitals in transition metal chalcogenides , are unoccupied and energetically far above the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the se@xmath20 ions in fese are repulsive and therefore that effectively se vacancies will be attractive . of all the orbitals in the system </S>",
    "<S> the vcfs orbital will feel this attractive potential most strongly as its wave function is centered right below the se vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> another way to understand the presence of the fe-@xmath6 orbital is that without the neighboring se ligand the fe ions that surround the se vacancy become more like atomic fe , which has both its @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals filled .        </S>",
    "<S> now let us go back to our main question whether se vacancies can electron dope fese . </S>",
    "<S> if the vcfs orbital was pulled completely below the fermi energy , then the two electrons donated by the se vacancy would be completely absorbed . </S>",
    "<S> however if we look at the unfolded band structure in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](a ) we see that the vcfs band ( indicated with the red color ) is only partly occupied . from integrating the vcfs orbital density of states up to the fermi energy we find that the vcfs band is filled with @xmath23 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this fractional filling is the large splittings induced by the very strong hybridization ( @xmath24ev ) with the surrounding se-@xmath13 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the vcfs spectral weight to be partly below and partly above the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the same analysis has been performed for other monolayer and bulk supercells  @xcite and for all of them the same conclusion was reached that each se vacancy pulls down a vcfs band into the fe-@xmath0 band complex with a filling of @xmath23 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we checked  @xcite that the se vacancy induced ferrimagnetism and lattice relaxation  @xcite does not alter the filling of the vcfs orbital . </S>",
    "<S> the vcfs shows similar large occupancies ( @xmath25 electrons per as vacancy ) in the ba@xmath5fe@xmath26as@xmath1 and li@xmath16fe@xmath16as@xmath17 supercells which demonstrates its importance for all iron based superconducting families in which anion deficiencies frequently occur . at this point </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from a single impurity point of view that unexpectedly the se vacancy only dopes @xmath27 electrons in the fe-@xmath0 bands as the other @xmath23 have been absorbed by the vcfs orbital .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as was demonstrated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , multiple disordered impurities can conspire together to induce an effective doping in which the fermi energy shifts without the addition or removal of physical electrons . </S>",
    "<S> therefore let us now study the bandstructure of disordered fese@xmath28 . as a reference we first show the bandstructure of the clean fese without se vacancies in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) . in the bottom panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) a rigid band shift is indicated corresponding to 0.2 electrons per fe , which is what would have naively been expected for 10 percent of se vacancies . as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) such a shift ( indicated by the dotted line and the arrow ) would have almost completely removed the hole pocket around @xmath29 from the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> such a trend would have been in good agreement with the arpes experiments  @xcite , which measure no hole pocket for the annealed fese monolayer .    </S>",
    "<S> yet it turns out that the se vacancies behave like hole dopants rather than electron dopants . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) the bandstructure of the monolayer fese with 10 percent disordered se vacancies is shown . </S>",
    "<S> if we compare the bands around the fermi surface of the clean fese in the bottom of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) with those of the disordered fese@xmath28 in the bottom of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) we see that the hole pockets are enhanced rather than diminished . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the fermi momentum of the outer hole sheet is enhanced by @xmath245% and an additional inner hole sheet emerges . </S>",
    "<S> this is in drastic disagreement with the rigid band shift in the bottom of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) in which the hole pockets were almost removed . to a large extent , </S>",
    "<S> the occupied flat vcfs spectral weight shown in the top of fig . [ fig : fig2](c ) is responsible for the difference . just as in the single impurity supercell case ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ) the vcfs orbitals are filled with roughly @xmath241.4 electrons . still , given that the se vacancies behave like hole dopants this leaves more than @xmath240.6 electrons per se vacancy unaccounted for .    </S>",
    "<S> we further observe that the bands of the disordered fese@xmath28 broaden significantly . </S>",
    "<S> these broadenings in both frequency and momentum space correspond to the finite lifetime caused by the scattering from the se vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that not only the se-@xmath13 bands but also the fe-@xmath0 bands broaden is important and was missed in an earlier calculation  @xcite based on the coherent potential approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening of the fe-@xmath0 bands is caused indirectly by the fe-@xmath0/se-@xmath13 hybridization and directly by the strong but non - local impurity potential of the se vacancies that act on the surrounding fe-@xmath0 orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> the disorder induced broadenings of the quasi - particle peaks in the fe-@xmath0 bands are the reason why se vacancies behave like hole dopants rather than weak electron dopants . </S>",
    "<S> the tails of the quasi - particle peaks pin the fermi energy . therefore if more quasi - particle weight leaks below the fermi energy than above the fermi energy will shift downward corresponding to an effective hole doping @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it will be instructive to illustrate this effect with the raw data of the current case of disordered fese@xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> to this end we compute the band resolved spectral function @xmath30 in the eigenbasis @xmath31 of the clean fese of crystal of momentum @xmath10 and band @xmath32 . as an example we show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](a ) the quasi - particle peaks of bands 10 - 13 in the energy range @xmath33$]ev at crystal momentum @xmath34 corresponding to the bar indicated in the top panel of fig . [ fig : fig2](c ) . the contributions from the degenerate bands 10 and 11 and the degenerate bands 12 and 13 </S>",
    "<S> have been added to better visualize the tails of the quasi - particle peaks . from the numerical integration in [ fig : fig3](b ) we see that at this particular crystal momentum bands 12 and 13 leak more below the fermi energy ( 0.21e / fe ) than bands 10 and 11 leak above ( 0.08e / fe ) resulting in a net contribution to the effective doping of 0.13 holes per fe . </S>",
    "<S> of course the total effective doping is the sum of the contributions of all the bands at all the crystal momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this example illustrates how the disorder induced broadenings of the quasi - particle peaks control the fermi energy and cause an effective doping of the bands .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) spectral function at fixed crystal momentum @xmath34 with resolved contributions from bands 10 + 11 and 12 + 13 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) integrated spectral weight below / above the fermi energy of the bands 12 + 13/10 + 11 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> given that the se vacancies behave like hole dopants rather than electron dopants , they can not be the cause of the large electron doping in the fese monolayer as observed by arpes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves open alternative scenarios such as the oxygen vacancy induced electron doping . from arpes measurements  @xcite dispersionless spectral weight is found to be present in the srtio@xmath1 substrate but absent after the fese monolayer is deposited . </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted as an electron transfer from oxygen vacancy states in the substrate to the fe-@xmath0 bands in the fese monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> however this does not explain what the crucial role of the post - annealing is . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting scenario  @xcite is that during the se etching oxygens are replaced with se , which due to their large radius will induce se vacancies in the fese monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> building on this idea we can reverse the initial proposal . </S>",
    "<S> the post - annealing could move the se from the substrate to the monolayer , thereby removing the se vacancies rather then creating them . </S>",
    "<S> this would induce an electron doping as se vacancies are removed and oxygen vacancies are created and would be consistent with the observation  @xcite that only the interfacial layer is doped but not the second monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore this could explain why the fermi surface becomes sharper during the annealing procedure since the oxygen vacancies will scatter the fe - d bands less than the se vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the study of such a complicated scenario would require the consideration of the substrate .    </S>",
    "<S> the unexpected doping effects of the anion vacancies reported in this study also have important implications for their controversial role in the iron based superconductors in general . </S>",
    "<S> for example arpes measurements  @xcite have shown an unexpected net hole doping in the isovalent substituted bafe@xmath35(as@xmath36p@xmath3)@xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> but very puzzling , the same sample also displays a large amount ( @xmath2410% ) of anion vacancies and/or excess fe , which naively should have electron - doped the system strongly , instead . a large vcfs occupancy in combination with an effective hole doping offers a most likely explanation of this anti - intuitive observation .    </S>",
    "<S> while some studies  @xcite conclude that anion vacancies suppress the superconductivity , others  @xcite conclude that they are an essential ingredient . to resolve this debate the microscopic effect of the anion vacancies on the fe-@xmath0 carriers must be known . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown here that , counter - intuitively , the anion vacancies lower the fermi energy which tunes the nesting conditions that govern the spin @xcite and orbital@xcite fluctuation theories of the superconductivity . yet at the same time the anion vacancies only change the filling of the fe-@xmath0 orbitals slightly since most of the doped electrons are absorbed by the vcfs orbital . </S>",
    "<S> this means for example that anion vacancies will not significantly reduce the effect of the hund s coupling which is known to be crucial for the correlations and the magnetism in these compounds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the very strong hybridization ( @xmath24 ev ) of the vcfs orbitals with their surrounding anion-@xmath13 orbitals will modify the strong coupling theories of the superconductivity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a priory one would think that around the anion vacancy the magnetic exchange between the fe-@xmath0 moments would be reduced since the hopping processes via the removed anions are deactivated . however , due to the surprising emergence of the vcfs state new types of hopping processes are allowed via the vcfs orbital . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of these magnetic exchanges is an important task for future studies . </S>",
    "<S> finally the strong scattering by the anion vacancies as reflected by the large broadenings of the fe-@xmath0 bands will allow the balance between the competing magnetism and superconductivity to be tipped  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together these important insights can shed new light on the controversial role of anion vacancies in the iron based superconductors .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated from first principles the doping effects of disordered se vacancies on monolayer fese . </S>",
    "<S> we find that se vacancies pull a vacancy centered orbital below the fermi energy that absorbs most of the doped electrons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we find that the disorder induced broadening causes an effective hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> the surprising net result is that se vacancies in terms of the fe-@xmath0 bands behave as hole dopants rather than electron dopants . </S>",
    "<S> our results exclude se vacancies as the origin of the large electron pockets measured by arpes . </S>",
    "<S> the counter - intuitive doping effects found in this study also give new insight in the debated role of anion vacancies in the iron based superconductors , and exemplify the rich unexpected effects of vacancies in materials in general .    </S>",
