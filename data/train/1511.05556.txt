    "particulate materials are relevant in a variety of systems of practical relevance .",
    "it is well known that macroscopic properties of these systems are related to the force networks - the mesoscale structures that characterize the internal stress distribution .",
    "the force networks are built on top of the contact networks formed by the particles .",
    "these contact networks have been studied using a number of approaches , see  @xcite for reviews .",
    "however , the properties of force networks , that form a subset of the contact networks based on the interaction force , are not slaved to the contact one : a single contact network can support infinite set of possible force networks , due to indeterminacy of the interaction forces .",
    "these force networks have been analyzed using a variety of approaches , including distributions of the force strengths between the particles  @xcite , the tools of statistical physics  @xcite , local properties of the force networks  @xcite , networks - based type of analysis  @xcite , as well as the topology - based measures  @xcite .",
    "of relevance to the present work are the recent results obtained using algebraic topology  @xcite that have shown that in particular frictional properties of the particles play an important role in determining connectivity properties of the considered force networks . for illustration ,",
    "[ exp ] shows an example of the experimental system ( discussed in more details later in the paper ) , where the particles are visualized without ( a ) and with ( b ) cross - polarizers ; in the part ( b ) force networks are clearly visible .    the recent work  @xcite suggests that properties of these force networks are universal . in other words ,",
    "the finding is that , when properly scaled , the distributions of force clusters ( defined as groups of particles in contact experiencing the force larger than a specified threshold ) collapse to a single curve . in  @xcite it has been argued that this universality finding is independent of the particle properties like polydispersity and friction , or anisotropy of the force networks induced by shear  @xcite .",
    "the influence of anisotropy on the exponents describing scaling ( and universality ) properties of force networks was further considered using @xmath0-model  @xcite , where it was found that anisotropy may have a strong influence on the scaling exponents .    in the present work",
    ", we further explore the generality of the proposed universality , using discrete element simulations in the setup where anisotropy is not relevant .",
    "this exploration is motivated in part by the following ` thought ' experiment .",
    "consider a model problem of perfectly ordered monodisperse particles that under compression form a crystal - like structure .",
    "in such a structure , each particle experiences the same total normal force , @xmath1 ( normalized by the average force ) .",
    "if we choose any force threshold @xmath2 , we obtain only one ( percolating ) cluster that includes all the particles . for any @xmath3",
    ", there are no particles . as an outcome , the mean cluster size , @xmath4 ,",
    "is a heaviside function regardless of the system size .",
    "considering the scaling properties of the @xmath5-curve for different system sizes is therefore trivial and the scaling exponents ( discussed in detail in the rest of the paper ) are not well defined .",
    "furthermore , the fractal dimension , @xmath6 , related to the scaling exponents  @xcite , leads trivially to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of physical dimensions .",
    "clearly , the scaling properties of such an ideal system are different compared to the ones expected for a general disordered system . therefore , we found at least one system where ` universality ' does not hold .",
    "one could argue that such perfect system as discussed above is not relevant to physical setups , so let us consider a small perturbation - for example a system of particles of the same or similar sizes , possibly frictionless , that are known to partially crystallize under compression  @xcite .",
    "for such systems , @xmath4 is not a heaviside step function , but it may be close to it .",
    "there is an open question therefore whether these systems ( that partially crystallize ) still lead to ` universal ' force networks .",

    "note also that the error in @xmath6 is smaller than the one for @xmath9 ; this is due to the fact that @xmath6 is based on the properties of the percolating cluster that typically involves large number of particles , while the calculation of @xmath9 is based on smaller clusters . therefore , the quality of data used for calculating @xmath6 is in general much better .",
    "we note that the values obtained for @xmath9 are significantly lower than those given in  @xcite ( reported value @xmath135 ) , which is outside of the confidence interval for @xmath9 and @xmath6 computed here .",
    "while it is difficult to comment on the source of this difference , it may have to do with the manner in which @xmath9 is computed in  @xcite - only a single domain size with @xmath136 particles was used , and then this domain was split into subdomains , with the largest subdomains discarded .",

    "direct comparison of these two figures shows the following : ( i ) the collapse appears to be much better for the considered frictionless system ( the minimum value of @xmath115 is smaller ) ; ( ii ) the optimal values of @xmath125 are significantly different : @xmath10 is much larger , and @xmath11 is much smaller for @xmath141 system .",
    "we note that the minimum of @xmath115 curve in fig .",
    "[ err_plot_r00mu00](b ) is not as clearly defined as for the reference system , introducing some inaccuracy in the process of finding optimal values of @xmath125 .",
    "however , as it can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ err_plot_r00mu00](b ) , this inaccuracy still limits @xmath11 to a very small value , @xmath166 , and @xmath10 to a very large value , @xmath167 .",
    "figure  [ err_plot_r00mu00 ] suggests some significant differences between @xmath165 and the reference system at @xmath90 .",
    "table  [ fp_nu_frictionless ] shows that the differences are present for other considered packing fractions as well . in particular , we always find large values of @xmath10 and very small values of @xmath11 for @xmath165 system .",
    "small overall values of @xmath115 are a sign of a good quality of the collapse .",
    "we note again that for the smallest @xmath68 , the optimal values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 are different from the rest , suggesting that scaling properties of force networks very close to jamming transition may differ .",
    "one obvious question to ask is what causes a particularly large difference between @xmath11 and @xmath69 for @xmath165 system ( recall that typically @xmath168 $ ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that it may be caused by a finite system size .",
    "note that the percolation threshold in a finite size system , @xmath69 , is related to the one of the infinite size system , @xmath169 , by  @xcite @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "this relation suggests a strong influence of the system size on @xmath69 for large values of @xmath10 , such as those we are reporting in table  [ fp_nu_frictionless ] for @xmath165 system .",
    "therefore , our conjecture is that the agreement of @xmath11 and @xmath69 could still be found if very large system size are considered . in particular ,",
    "if we assume that @xmath11 is close to @xmath172 , the values of @xmath173 would be for a very large system both in the range @xmath174 $ ] for @xmath165 system ( see table  [ fp_nu_frictionless ] ) .",
    "we close this section by pointing out that @xmath10 could in principle be computed using alternative approaches .",
    "one avenue is to use eq .",
    "( [ eq_favg_vs_l ] ) ; the value of @xmath69 is found as an average percolation threshold for each @xmath43 and plotted against the natural logarithm @xmath175 ; the slope of the linear fit should correspond to @xmath176 .",
    "however , we find that the error of the linear fit is large , leading to the results that are less accurate than the ones already obtained . alternatively",
    ", we could estimate @xmath9 from the fisher exponent @xmath71 , see eq .",
    "( [ scaling_ns ] ) , and the relation @xmath177 .",
    "the results for @xmath9 obtained in this manner are again characterized by large error bars .",
    "we note that while both of the outlined approaches lead to the results that are inaccurate , they are still consistent with the ones found by scaling .",
    "in this section we report the results of physical experiments carried out with photoelastic particles , made from the psm-1 sheets obtained from vishay precision group ; details about the material properties of these particles could be found in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ exp ] shows the experimental setup that consists of two plexiglass plates with a thin gap in between .",
    "the size of the gap is slightly larger than the thickness of the particles .",
    "the domain is bounded by four walls , one of which is removable and can slide in and out .",
    "the experimental protocol consists of placing the particles in the gap , mixing them up , and than replacing the removable wall and gently applying desired pressure by a certain number ( @xmath153 - @xmath178 ) of rubber bands .",
    "the applied pressures lead only to modest inter - particle forces . for each pressure ,",
    "@xmath178 realizations are carried out .",
    "the stress on the particles is visualized using cross - polarizers ( see fig .",
    "[ exp](b ) ) .",
    "the photographs are processed using the hough transform  @xcite image processing technique to detect particles . from the brightness of the particles ,",
    "the total stresses are computed via @xmath179 method used extensively by behringer s group ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the experiments are carried out using three particle sizes of diameters @xmath180 and @xmath181 cm .",
    "we consider a monodisperse system ( with medium particles only ) and two bidisperse ones that use large / medium and large / small particles . for bidisperse systems",
    ", we always use equal area fraction of particles of different sizes .",
    "approximately @xmath182 particles are used in total .",
    "the obtained data are processed similarly to the ones resulting from the simulations , with the difference that here we focus on the magnitude of the total stress on a particle , instead on contact forces , as in simulations .",
    "since only a single domain size is available , the domain is divided into @xmath183 and @xmath184 smaller sub - domains of @xmath185 and @xmath186 of the original domain size . @xmath6 and @xmath9 are then computed using the box - counting method and by fitting the peaks of @xmath5-curves , respectively . in what follows we focus on these two quantities only , since they could be obtained with a reasonable accuracy using available resources .",
    "+    figure  [ fig_df_fc ] shows @xmath6 and @xmath138 computed from the experimental data .",
    "we note that while @xmath6 is consistent for the whole range of pressures applied and for all experimental setups , the value of @xmath138 has a larger variation , similarly as for the results obtained from the simulations . since the number of realizations used for the experiments is much smaller , relatively large standard error is observed in the results .",
    "still , the experiments yield @xmath6 and @xmath9 that are consistent with the results obtained from the simulations carried out with frictional particles .",
    "this is encouraging , in particular since the protocols in simulations and experiments differ ( e.g. , controlled pressure versus controlled packing fraction , additional friction between the particles and the substrate in experiments , that is not present in simulations ) ; in addition , we have not attempted to precisely match the simulation parameters with material properties of the particles .",
    "the consistency of the results therefore suggests that they are independent of the protocol and of the material properties , at least for the applied pressures considered .",
    "we emphasize in particular that both simulation and experimental results lead to @xmath6 and @xmath9 that are significantly smaller than the previously proposed value of @xmath187  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the scaling properties of force networks in compressed particulate systems in two spatial dimensions . to complement the results obtained by exploring scaling properties of the force networks",
    ", we also calculate the fractal dimension . for disordered systems , we find that the scaling exponent , @xmath9 , and the fractal dimension , @xmath6 , are consistent over a range of considered packing fractions , @xmath68 .",
    "the computed values are however significantly lower than the previously proposed ones , and in particular we find that @xmath188 .",
    "this value is consistent with the one extracted from the physical experiments involving two dimensional systems of monodisperse and bidisperse frictional particles exposed to compression .",
    "another significant finding is that the results for @xmath9 and @xmath6 are not consistent for the systems of monodispserse frictionless particles that partially crystallize under compression .",
    "we obtain considerably different values of @xmath6 for these systems and present evidence that formation of partially ordered polycrystalline structure is the reason for this differences .",
    "in addition , for these systems , we find that the values of the other scaling exponent , @xmath10 , is very large while critical force threshold , @xmath11 , is very small , when compared to the systems that are not partially crystallized .",
    "our results suggest that the particulate systems that develop ordered structures do not belong to the same ( if any ) universality class as the disordered ones .",
    "these results open new directions of research , including working towards understanding the conditions under which scaling properties of force networks are at least consistent if not universal .",
    "another question is how do our findings extend to three dimensional systems . and",
    "finally , how the scaling properties of the force networks relate to the macroscopic properties of the underlying physical systems .",
