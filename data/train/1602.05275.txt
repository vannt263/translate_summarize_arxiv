    "the migration and dispersion of solutes in groundwater systems is fundamental to chemical and biological reaction in the regolith .",
    "solute transport in porous media is a well studied topic , and relevant dispersion , dilution and mixing process models have utility across a range of transport and reaction scenarios , including in contaminant remediation , in extraction of commodities ( minerals , oil and gas ) , in surface water - groundwater interaction , and so on .",
    "in fact , more generally , fluid dispersion , dilution and mixing belong to a broad class of _ dissipative processes _ that mediate structure and instability in the geosciences , where thermal , hydrological , mechanical and chemical ( thmc ) phenomena are coupled over wide ranges of spatial and temporal scales  @xcite .",
    "evidence is growing that fluid dissipation processes manifesting at one scale can have profound influences on mechanical , thermal and chemical structures at larger scales .",
    "it is important to consider whether our understandings of solute transport in porous media are sufficient to underpin the rich set of dependent phenomena .",
    "if we focus on the problem of solute transport in groundwater systems , the last forty years have seen growing sophistication of conceptual and theoretical tools , observations and predictions of spreading and reaction in solute plumes .",
    "even so , there is still much to learn about how fluids and solutes migrate and mix in porous media , and how we may control or manipulate these transport processes for benefit .",
    "despite recent advances in dynamical engineering of subsurface reactions at the macroscale @xcite , significant questions about the scale dependence of plume dispersion , about solute mixing and about _ in situ _ biogeochemical reaction kinetics remain unresolved .",
    "it is our thesis that the resolution of these meso / macroscale questions lies at the pore scale , specifically in terms of the complex interplay between the pore space and fluid mechanics , and how this interplay upscales into observed plume characteristics .",
    "we contend that pore - scale dynamics engender characteristics of transport and mixing that persist through upscaling into the macroscopic domain and therefore play an important role in conditioning effective mixing and reaction phenomena in porous media .",
    "computer tomography ( ct ) has enabled significant advances in the understanding and prediction of pore scale fluid percolation , transport and reaction phenomena  @xcite .",
    "using three - dimensional ( 3d ) micro - ct scanning , it is possible to construct digital representations of pore spaces from physical samples , and then use numerical flow and transport solvers to track and predict fluid - borne phenomena in three dimensions .",
    "for example , liu and regenauer - lieb @xcite show how digital cores can be post - processed to characterise percolation thresholds and critical indices , which permits detailed upscaling of microscopic sample observations to effective macroscopic material properties .",
    "kang et al .",
    "@xcite use low - reynolds number navier - stokes computations to show how the pore fluid velocity bursts observed in strongly heterogeneous systems are correlated with anomalous transport signatures at the micron scale in real rock samples . in a larger scale study , alhashmi et al .",
    "@xcite have imaged spherical bead assemblies and generated stokes flow fields in the interstitial spaces . from these fields they were able to reconcile under - prediction of effective bimolecular reaction rates in terms of incomplete fluid mixing in the complex pore space .",
    "the digital imaging approach is also being used to progress detailed simulations of multiphase processes in complex pore geometries at the micron scale @xcite .",
    "together , these and other studies have shown that it is possible to link the microscale to the macroscale through a combination of high - resolution imaging , direct computation and upscaling techniques . however , dealing simultaneously with the complexities of topology , geometry and fluid reactions may obscure some of the component processes .",
    "stochastic models offer a means to deal with both the uncertainty and complexity of the both the pore - scale architecture and macroscopic heterogeneities , and to facilitate upscaling .",
    "the kernels of the stochastic models embody the physical properties of both the porous medium and the hosted processes .",
    "whilst these models possess a great deal of flexibility with respect to capturing a wide range of ( often anomalous ) transport , mixing and reaction phenomena , it is important to develop strong linkages between the physical processes and the model kernels .",
    "the alternative approach is to create stochastic models with `` black box '' kernels derived from regression analysis , which provide limited physical insight into the process at hand , and hamper development of generalised models which may be readily applied to different media or chemical kinetics .",
    "this shortcoming often manifests as an upscaling failure - i.e. models which are conditioned upon observations at a particular length - scale fail at others , or can not be readily translated to regimes with different peclt or damkhler numbers .",
    "central to the development of so - called _ physically conditioned _",
    "stochastic models is the need to derive models which capture the underlying fundamental dynamics and so recover the associated constraints and physical phenomena . as the kernels of these models are more tightly constrained they exhibit a reduced risk of spurious regression , are directly linked to the underlying physical processes , and so are more readily generalised across scales , media and processes .    in this paper",
    "we consider how the kinematics of steady 3d flow at the pore - scale influence macroscopic fluid mixing and chemical transport in saturated porous media , and how to develop upscaled models of dispersion and dilution which capture these processes .",
    "our purpose here is to strengthen the conceptual linkages between pore - scale physics and macroscopic observations of solute transport and mixing in porous media .",
    "this paper describes concepts of pore scale topology and how they relate to transport of solutes in porous media .",
    "dimensionality is a critical parameter .",
    "in contrast with common conceptual pictures of two dimensional branching of fluid streamlines used as a motivation for hydrodynamic dispersion , it is shown that proper consideration of truly 3d flow and transport at the pore scale admits wholly new transport mechanisms which are not readily apparent in conventional dispersion models .",
    "specifically , 3d steady flow opens the door to the possibility of chaotic fluid trajectories @xcite , whereby fluid elements deform exponentially in time , leading to wholly different mixing and dispersion .",
    "indeed , chaotic advection has been shown @xcite to be inherent to steady 3d flow at the pore scale .",
    "conversely , these dynamics are inadmissible in steady 2d flow , and so are neglected  or in fact not suspected to be needed  in conventional modelling frameworks",
    ".    such chaotic ( space - filling ) transport dynamics are quite distinct from the conventional picture of hydrodynamic dispersion and can lead to persistent features that manifest in solute plumes at much greater spatial and temporal scales .",
    "the paper provides examples of persistent pore - scale chaotic phenomena , and then discusses some implications of pore - scale chaos for macroscopic transport .",
    "this topological approach to fluid physics at the pore scale is a relatively new area and opportunities abound for further development .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows ; section  [ sec : porescale_flow_deform ] discusses topology of the pore pace and implications for flow , section  [ sec : pore_chaos ] discusses the mechanisms which lead to chaotic advection at the pore scale , and in section  [ sec : network_model ] fluid flow and transport are considered in a model open porous network . in section  [ sec : pore_mixing ] pore - scale mixing due to the interplay of chaotic advection and molecular diffusion is quantified , and the impact of these processes upon longitudinal dispersion is considered in section  [ sec : long_disperse ] .",
    "a discussion of approaches to extend the derived results to real porous media is presented in section  [ sec : real_media ] , and the paper concludes with some commentary on particularly promising research directions .",
    "in general , as fluid mixing and dispersion involves the interplay of fluid deformation , advection and molecular diffusion , successful upscaling of these phenomena must capture the salient features of these processes at the micro - scale . the classical picture of flow and transport at the pore scale ( e.g. bear and verruijt , 1987 @xcite ) typically involves the depiction of fluid streamline dynamics meandering through a 2d domain punctuated by an arbitrary array of inclusions , as depicted in figure  [ fig:2dstreamlines ] .",
    "this conceptual image illustrates the features which organise transport and dispersion but , if interpreted literally , the 2d nature of the fluid domain actually imposes severe constraints upon the admissible fluid dynamics , which in turn impact transport and mixing . whilst conceptual , these topological constraints implicitly skew our understanding of the mechanisms which drive transport and mixing and neglect other important phenomena which may occur in 3d domains .",
    "[ h ]     [ h ]     for all steady 2d flows , an important topological constraint arises from the fact that the fluid acts as a continuum , and so streamlines can not cross over each other , as reflected in figure  [ fig:2dstreamlines ] . as such , whilst the distance between neighbouring streamlines in 2d flows may fluctuate along a streamline , the separation distance can not grow or shrink without bound due to conservation of mass . although distance fluctuations can persist as streamlines pass either side of the stagnation points of grains and inclusions ,",
    "eventually these streamlines must recombine , as shown in figures  [ fig:2dstreamlines],[fig:2dexperimental ] .",
    "this topological constraint , which is formally imposed by the poincar - bendixson theorem  @xcite , places significant restrictions on fluid deformation and hence transport of a diffusive scalar ( solutes , heat etc ) since no steady 2d flow can be chaotic - all such flows are regular with deformations which scale algebraically with time .",
    "hence the only mechanism for persistent dispersion of solutes transverse to the mean flow direction is molecular diffusion .",
    "that is , transverse diffusion is the only physical means by which scalar quantities can spread transversely without bound in two dimensions to generate the observed lateral spreading of macroscale plumes . in contrast to the conventional picture of dispersion , the divergence of streamlines around inclusions ( specifically , around stagnation points ) is immaterial with respect to macroscopic transverse dispersion as eventually these streamlines must recombine downstream due to the topological constraint inherent to 2d steady flow .",
    "however , this topological constraint does not apply to 3d steady flows , as the additional degree of freedom associated with the third spatial dimension removes the restriction that a fluid streamline is bounded by its neighbours , and so streamlines may wander much more freely throughout the pore space . as such , continua may deform in a more complex manner , and streamlines may now diverge or converge without bound even if the flow is incompressible .",
    "hence , 3d transport is not simply a 3d extrusion of the dynamics shown in figure  [ fig:2dstreamlines ] , but rather 3d flows exhibit fundamentally different dynamics which introduce wholly new transport and mixing phenomena .",
    "it is these pore - scale dynamics that we shall explore and quantify in this study , and determine some of the related implications for macroscopic transport and dispersion .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     for real homogeneous porous media the topology and geometry of the pore space is more complex than is catered for in the idealised 3d network that we use here for illustration .",
    "this difference would lead to alterations in the transverse stretching rates @xmath0 , and spatial @xmath1 and temporal @xmath2 increments in the ctrw model .",
    "it is important to note that the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 does not directly control longitudinal plume dispersion ; rather @xmath0 ensures ergodicity of fluid orbits which renders the assumptions of the ctrw model valid , and so only the spatial and temporal increments control longitudinal dispersion .",
    "the asymptotic scaling result ( [ eqn : asymptote ] ) holds for all @xmath1 under the poiseuille ( pareto ) time increment ( [ eqn : pareto ] ) . in general , the ctrw longitudinal dispersion for any porous medium can be derived , given @xmath2 , @xmath3 . as discussed by lester et al .",
    "@xcite , the no - slip boundary condition generates unbounded temporal increments @xmath2 and , as a consequence , for any spatial increment distribution @xmath3 , the ctrw dynamics lead to pre - asymptotic and asymptotic transport which is universally anomalous ( super - linear but sub - ballistic ) .    these results may also be extended to the case of diffusive tracers , where pore - scale chaotic advection acts to significantly accelerate scalar mixing , essentially enhancing the taylor - aris mechanism for molecular diffusion , and so further retarding longitudinal dispersion . in the presence of molecular diffusion ,",
    "the asymptotic longitudinal dispersion dynamics are rendered fickian , and so may be quantified solely in terms of an asymptotic dispersion coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "these dynamics are most clearly illustrated via consideration of the mathematical connection between transverse mixing and rtd evolution in boundary - dominated flows  @xcite .",
    "in general , the rate of transverse mixing scales with peclt number @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 for chaotic advection . the relationship between longitudinal dispersion and",
    "traverse mixing then yields  @xcite @xmath8 in general , accelerated transverse mixing directly retards asymptotic longitudinal dispersion . whilst diffusive longitudinal dispersion is yet to be couched in terms of stochastic models , the physical mechanisms are generic to all porous media , time scales and length scales , and have profound effects upon dispersion at the macroscale .",
    "hence , pore - scale chaotic advection significantly augments dispersion and mixing at the macroscale in all porous media .",
    "the pore - scale advection dynamics and implications for dispersion and mixing analysed in sections  [ sec : network_model]-[sec : long_disperse ] are based upon idealised models of random porous media and leading - order analysis of the deformation dynamics and associated mixing phenomena .",
    "whilst quantitative , these idealised models act to illustrate the governing mechanisms and resultant scalings for mixing and dispersion . to develop more general theories of macroscopic transport which capture the effects of more realistic pore - scale phenomena , it it necessary to extend these results to non - ideal media , such as pore space architectures given by micro - ct imaging studies .",
    "such an approach not only facilitates the development of stochastic models of mixing and dispersion which honour the pore - scale advection dynamics but also provide important data with respect to linking measures of pore - scale geometry ( such as topology , tortuosity , heterogeneity ) of real media to stochastic mixing kernels .",
    "this approach both identifies the pore - scale features which govern transport and mixing and paves the way for development of stochastic models which are couched directly in terms of medium properties . by utilising recent developments in lamellar mixing models  @xcite for porous media which use deformation dynamics as inputs ,",
    "it is possible to predict evolution of the full concentration pdf within the plume , which is important for upscaling of mixing and nonlinear chemical reactions .",
    "although exponential fluid stretching due to pore - scale chaotic advection dominates over algebraic deformation due to shear in the asymptotic limit , convergence to this regime may be slow , and so shear deformation can also play an important role in the pre - asymptotic regime .",
    "moreover , fluid deformation ( strain ) is a tensorial , rather than scalar , quantity , and so to capture all of the augmented transport dynamics that arise from the interplay of molecular diffusion and fluid advection at the pore - scale it is necessary to properly quantify the full fluid deformation gradient tensor @xmath9 which evolves along a streamline as @xmath10^t\\cdot\\mathbf{f}(t),\\,\\,\\mathbf{f}(0)=\\mathbf{i},\\label{eqn : deform3d}\\ ] ] where the advection time @xmath11 denotes the position @xmath12 along a streamline with initial position @xmath13 .",
    "this issue is illustrated by consideration of the difference between 3d fluid mixing under continuous or pulsed injection of a line source .",
    "focusing solely upon the advection dynamics ( i.e. ignoring diffusion ) , in the continuous injection case ( as considered in section  [ sec : pore_mixing ] ) the line source forms a continuous 2d sheet which is stretched exponentially and folded into a 2d lamellar structure .",
    "deformation of this sheet is governed by longitudinal and transverse stretching and shear , as quantified by the elements of @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , transient injection of a line source ( as considered in section  [ sec : long_disperse ] ) at the same injection point generates a continuous 1d line which , at any point in time , resides within the 2d sheet described above .",
    "whilst deformation of this 1d line evolves in a different manner to that of the 2d sheet , this evolution is also quantified by the elements of @xmath9 , albeit a different combination to that of the 2d sheet . as such",
    ", there is not a unique scalar stretching rate that characterises fluid deformation relevant to all transport phenomena but rather an evolving tensorial quantity , the elements of which are relevant for different initial and boundary conditions .",
    "while pore - scale imaging provides topographic data for specific porous samples , it is necessary to develop stochastic models of dispersion and mixing from these datasets under appropriate assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity .",
    "this approach facilitates the development of upscaled transport models which both honour the pore - scale dynamics and are derived directly from the pore - scale architecture .",
    "this approach revolves around development of a ctrw model of fluid deformation , the stochastic kernels of which are populated from pore - scale computational fluid dynamics simulations .",
    "this approach is supported by observations over several different 2d and 3d steady flow fields  @xcite that fluid advection ( and hence deformation ) follows a spatial markov process along fluid streamlines .",
    "given computation of the steady fluid velocity field @xmath14 and velociy gradient @xmath15 to sufficient precision over the pore - space , the fluid deformation evolves as per ( [ eqn : deform3d ] ) .",
    "recent studies  @xcite have shown that by rotation of ( [ eqn : deform3d ] ) into a streamline coordinate system , the fluid deformation evolution equation ( [ eqn : deform3d ] ) takes on a particularly simple form , and permits explicit solution in terms of a ctrw along fluid streamlines .",
    "as the elements of the velocity gradient in this frame are almost fully independent and gaussian distributed for random flows  @xcite , stochastic models for the evolution of @xmath16 can be directly determined from pore - scale fluid dynamics simulations .",
    "this stochastic characterisation of tensorial fluid deformation generates a richer dataset than is given by , for example , the lyaponuv exponent or algebraic stretching rate alone , and so can be used as inputs for lamellar - based models of dilution and mixing relevant to various transport phenomena .    under this approach ,",
    "exponential fluid stretching due to pore - scale chaos is captured along with shear deformation due to viscous flow , facilitating characterisation of mixing and dispersion in both the pre - asymptotic and asymptotic regimes .",
    "the development permits application of lamellar mixing models  @xcite to predict evolution of concentration pdf within a solute plume , as well as augmented longitudinal and transverse dispersion which explicitly capture the deformation dynamics inherent to the porous architecture .",
    "these stochastic models automatically capture pore - scale chaotic advection , and facilitate the development of quantitative linkages between pore - scale geometry ( such as topology , tortuously , heterogeneity etc ) and the stochastic kernels . in the absence of such tools , it is difficult to envisage how to process the large datasets associated with cfd modelling of pore - scale geometries beyond direct simulation of transport and mixing in the specific porous architectures at hand .",
    "stochastic modelling of fluid deformation and lamellar mixing addresses this need and thus provides the building blocks for upscaling methods for mixing and transport which explicitly honour both the pore - scale deformation dynamics and architecture .",
    "there is considerable empirical evidence dating back to the 1960 s to show that the mixing and spreading of solute plumes as they travel through saturated porous media display unexpected dynamics and statistics , at both short and long travel times .",
    "early researchers sought to reconcile these characteristics by identifying upscaled ( effective ) quantities at the representative elemental volume ( rev ) scale or larger , e.g. macrodispersivities , bulk reaction rates etc .",
    "while consistent with the underlying picture of ( laminar ) darcian flow at the meso- and macroscale , these approaches neglected the complexity of fluid dynamics at the pore scale in favour of unduly homogenized descriptions . in recent years , as observation and computational techniques have advanced , it has become possible to study transport processes at the pore scale and to embark upon quantitative upscaling efforts to support estimation of effective parameters at the macroscale .",
    "even so there is a richness of physics operating at the pore scale that can be overlooked in the rush to find robust upscaling methodologies .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper that even steady , non - turbulent flows must engender chaotic ( space - filling ) fluid trajectories in all 3d random porous media , with an idealized 3d random pore network as an illustrative example .",
    "this profound result is a consequence of the topological complexity inherent to all porous media and presents a fundamentally new genesis for observed microscale plume spreading , that has previously been categorized as mechanical dispersion generated by streamline branching , as depicted in figure  [ fig:2dstreamlines ] .",
    "indeed , kinematically speaking , the process of steady streamlines separating around grain boundaries can not lead to persistent plume spreading in 2d and , as was shown in this work , persistent spreading can only be generated by steady continuum flows in 3d .",
    "chaotic advection in steady 3d pore - scale flow generates finely striated material distributions which , when coupled with molecular diffusion , leads to mixing and dispersion dynamics that are incongruent with traditional pictures of mechanical dispersion .",
    "the topological approach we have outlined allows fundamental characteristics of flow and transport to be studied independently of the vast complexities of pore geometry , surface roughness and chemical reaction that are so important in digital reconstructions of pore - fluid interactions .",
    "idealised pore network models show that pore fluids deform and mix rapidly through successive pore branch - merge transitions .",
    "the addition of molecular diffusion allows tracer distributions to be estimated , with fundamentally different asymptotic plume behaviours exhibited by 2d and 3d flows .",
    "plume maximum concentrations and variances decline algebraically with longitudinal distance in 2d ( [ eqn : cm2d ] ) , whereas in 3d this decay is exponential ( [ eqn : cm3d ] ) .",
    "chaotic advection inherent in 3d porous networks also retards temporal scaling of longitudinal dispersion ( [ eqn : asymptote ] ) to be super - diffusive rather than ballistic in the absence of molecular diffusion , and these chaotic signatures persist at the macroscale .",
    "these dynamics persist in the presence of molecular diffusion , where accelerated transverse mixing due to chaotic advection retards longitudinal dispersion as per ( [ eqn : long_dispersion ] ) .",
    "these augmented mixing and dilution dynamics have significant implications for effective reaction rates at the macroscale .    with these results in mind",
    "it is now appropriate to re - visit the conventional hydrodynamic dispersion conceptualisation depicted in figure  [ fig:2dstreamlines ] .",
    "molecular diffusion will always be present , as will the mechanical branching and channelling of flow around sediment grains and into pore throats .",
    "however the inherently 2d shear - dominated fluid deformation dynamics may now be seen to be an over - simplification and is potentially misleading in real systems .",
    "rather , mechanical dispersion in natural porous media is best viewed as a consequence of the continued stretching and folding experienced by genuinely 3d flows within assemblies of microscale pores and connections .",
    "thus chaotic advection is at the very heart of mechanical dispersion and it contributes to accelerated and persistent longitudinal and transverse spreading .",
    "it is vital that stochastic models capture these dynamics to facilitate the development of _ physically consistent _ upscaled transport theories .",
    "both the topology and geometry of the pore space make interlinked contributions to mechanical dispersion and , as we have shown , all random pore space topologies and geometries generate pervasive chaos , even the simple and highly idealised ones considered in this work .",
    "these fundamental topological results are independent of the geological and chemical complexity that is so prevalent in real systems .",
    "nevertheless , topological influences on flow and transport will always be present in observation and experiment .",
    "an important question is how to partition the observed net ( upscaled ) transport behaviours into contributions from the underlying component processes and phenomena .",
    "such a partitioning approach may be assisted by quantifying topological contributions to upscaled transport characteristics , and this paper has sought to take an early step down this path by focusing on the steady , low - energy flow domain .",
    "transient processes ( e.g. time - dependence , reaction kinetics ) and threshold phenomena ( e.g. immiscible phase displacement ) await pore - scale topological analysis .",
    "much more research needs to be done to develop a comprehensive picture of how the full richness of pore - scale physics expresses at the rev scale and beyond .",
    "to compose a 3d random open porous network model situated within the semi - infinite domain @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mean flow direction , we consider a series of so - called `` mapping planes '' ( figure  [ fig : pore_network](a ) ) oriented parallel to the @xmath19-plane , which are distributed along the @xmath18-axis at integer multiples of the dimensionless pore element length @xmath20 .",
    "for each realization of the random network model , the location of non - overlapping pores of dimensionless uniform diameter @xmath21 are prescribed by a random process within each mapping plane , and pore branch and merge elements are then used to connect pores between adjacent mapping planes to form a continuous 3d network .    to simplify composition",
    ", the network model is constrained to be periodic in the @xmath22 plane , such that the domain @xmath23 is comprised of reflections of the semi - infinite cell @xmath24\\times[0,1]\\times[0,\\infty)$ ] .",
    "the number of pores within each mapping plane in @xmath25 is @xmath26 , for some integer @xmath27 , and the location of the @xmath28-th pore in the @xmath29-th mapping plane in @xmath25 is then labelled @xmath30 .",
    "the non - overlapping condition is then @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 .    to construct the 3d network constrained to these locations , pores @xmath34 within each mapping plane",
    "are labelled as `` branch '' pores ( i.e. pores about to branch ) , and the remaining pores @xmath35 are labelled as `` merge pores '' ( i.e. about to merge ) , as per figure  [ fig : pore_network](a ) .",
    "a merge pore at plane @xmath29 is connected to two branch pores at plane @xmath36 by a pore branch element located between these planes , and conversely two branch pores at plane @xmath29 are connected with a single merge pore at plane @xmath29 by a pore merge element .",
    "connections between merge and branch pores in adjacent planes are made by identifying unique nearest neighbour groupings of a single merge pore in one plane and two branches in the adjacent plane ( accounting for periodicity in the @xmath19-plane ) , such that the following sum is minimized @xmath37 where @xmath38 indicates the elements in the @xmath19-plane only , and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the indicator function that pore @xmath28 in mapping plane @xmath29 branches ( merges ) to connect with pore @xmath41 in plane @xmath36 .",
    "note that groupings are restricted such that a pair of branch pores at plane @xmath42 common to a single merge pore at @xmath43 do not share the same merge pore at @xmath36 - this restriction eliminates `` degenerate '' pore branch / merger couplings which are isolated from the global network .",
    "as all pores undergo sequential branching and merging as they propagate along the @xmath18-coordinate , the volumetric flow - rate within each pore type is preserved ( where merge pores have half that of branch pores ) throughout the network .",
    "whilst this topology of sequential pore branching and merging is a small subset of the general topology of random porous networks , this minimum complexity is inherent to all porous media and is sufficient to generate chaotic advection  @xcite .    to accommodate connections between the merge pore locations @xmath44 and the branch pore location @xmath45 at adjacent mapping planes , the pore branch / merge element @xmath46 is rotated and stretched such that the @xmath47 , @xmath48 vectors in figure  [ fig : pore_branch ] respectively are aligned along @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the merge pore center - to - centre distance @xmath51 and @xmath52 extent @xmath53 of @xmath46 are re - scaled as @xmath54 and the orientation angle @xmath55 in the @xmath22 plane of a pore branch / merge element @xmath46 is then @xmath56 as @xmath55 describes the orientation of 2d manifolds ( or minimal flux surfaces ) in the fluid bulk , the distribution of @xmath55 governs both chaotic advection and transport dynamics throughout the porous network , whether random or ordered  @xcite .    following the process described above , the set of pore locations @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 completely defines a single realisation of the 3d open porous network , and the set of all realisations of the porous network form a statistical ensemble which is ergodic and stationary .",

    "<S> the macroscopic spreading and mixing of solute plumes in saturated porous media is ultimately controlled by processes operating at the pore scale . whilst the conventional picture of pore - scale mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion leading to persistent hydrodynamic dispersion is well accepted , this paradigm is inherently two - dimensional ( 2d ) in nature and neglects important three - dimensional ( 3d ) phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the kinematics of steady 3d flow at the pore - scale generate _ chaotic advection_involving exponential stretching and folding of fluid elements  the mechanisms by which it arises and implications of microscopic chaos for macroscopic dispersion and mixing . </S>",
    "<S> prohibited in steady 2d flow due to topological constraints , these phenomena are ubiquitous due to the topological complexity inherent to all 3d porous media . </S>",
    "<S> consequently 3d porous media flows generate profoundly different fluid deformation and mixing processes to those of 2d flow . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of chaotic advection and broad transit time distributions can be incorporated into a continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) framework to predict macroscopic solute mixing and spreading . </S>",
    "<S> we show how these results may be generalised to real porous architectures via a ctrw model of fluid deformation , leading to stochastic models of macroscopic dispersion and mixing which both honour the pore - scale kinematics and are directly conditioned on the pore - scale architecture .    </S>",
