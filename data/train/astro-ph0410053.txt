    "it is widely believed that accretion with angular momentum leads to ejection of jets .",
    "this belief is based on observations of jets in young stellar object ( ysos ) , low - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs & hmxbs ) and active galactic nuclei .",
    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , however , are a blatant exception from the presumed universality of the accretion  jet connection . however , cvs are not an exception from a more general , supposedly universal , relation between accretion and  ejection \" . indeed , although no jets have ever been observed in cvs , some of them emit winds . for example , p cygni profiles in resonant uv lines are observed in some very luminous cvs such as the nova - like stars and dwarf novae at outburst maximum .",
    "these winds are too cold to be ejected by a thermal mechanism and are most probably driven by radiative line pressure with some help of magnetic fields ( see e.g. proga , these proceedings ) .",
    "but they are winds , even if slightly collimated , but not jets .",
    "the presence of a white dwarf in the center of an accretion flow can not be considered to be responsible for this jet - blowing impotence since jets are observed in other accreting white - dwarf systems such as super soft x - ray source ( ssxs ) , symbiotic stars and novae .",
    "fast , @xmath1 , collimated outflows have been observed in some ssxss , rx j0513.9 - 6951 , rx j0019.8 + 2156 and rx j0925.7 - 4758 ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sl04 ) and symbiotic systems are also known to blow jets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "also the fast nova v1494 aql produced high velocity @xmath2 jets during its decline from outburst maximum @xcite .",
    "ssxss , symbiotic systems and classical novae differ from cvs by much higher accretion rates and the presence of an additional source of energy produced by thermonuclear reactions .",
    "although novae are cvs undergoing a thermonuclear runaway for the purpose of the present investigation we will separate them from the other members of this class of binaries .",
    "@xcite speculated that this latter difference might account for lack of jets in cvs , however , without providing a physical explanation .",
    "recently we ( sl04 ) have shown that this difference is naturally explained if jets in accreting white - dwarf systems are produced by a thermal mechanism . as discussed below",
    ", magnetic fields would play a role in jet formation but this would be rather auxiliary , the main thrust being provided by thermal pressure .",
    "first we will consider another suggestion by @xcite according to whom the absence of jets in cvs might be related to the small size of their accretion discs .",
    "the argument is based on numerical jet models of poloidal collimation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the vertical component of the magnetic field varies as @xmath3 and the jet opening angle is @xmath4 when discs extend down to the smallest possible circular orbit , cv discs are much less extended that those of lmxbs simply because a @xmath5 black hole is much smaller than a white dwarf .",
    "however , observations and models suggest that lmxb discs are often truncated , in particular during jet launching ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this case the two types of systems might have similar disc sizes .    indeed , taking for the outer disc radius @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the _ mean",
    "_ roche - lobe radius ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for the formula ) , one obtains for the ratio of the cv to lmxb putative jet opening angles @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the schwarzschild radius and we assumed a 1 @xmath10 white dwarf .",
    "since jets are observed during hard / low states when ( according to a popular scenario ) @xmath11 , the extent of the disc of a jet - launching lmxb could be comparable to that of a typical cv which makes the small disc argument not very compelling .",
    "one should add that although cvs discs can also be truncated , one expects jet to be launched at high accretion rates at which the accretion disc would reach down to the white dwarf surface .",
    "in jet models magnetic fields may play a dominant role in three types of processes : in triggering the _ jet ejection events _ , e.g. , by causing instabilities in the disk , in accelerating the jets ( as in the classic  centrifugal wind  mechanism , first proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and finally in collimating the jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since models containing all these three elements fail to account for the absence of jets in cvs one is justified in trying to replace at least one of them by a different mechanism .",
    "sl04 showed that depriving the magnetic field of its accelerating role and replacing it by the action of the thermal pressure not only offers a natural explanation of the absence of jets in cvs but also accounts for the presence of jets in other white - dwarf systems such as classical novae , ssxss and symbiotic stars .",
    "sl04 based their argument on the model of thermal pressure acceleration proposed by @xcite and @xcite recently developed and extended by @xcite to explain strongly collimated outflows in ysos . in this jet model magnetic fields",
    "are weak , and might serve only to re - collimate the outflow at large distances from the source and might trigger disturbances in the boundary layer ( bl ) where the disk adjust itself to the conditions at the surface of the accreting star .",
    "@xcite found two conditions necessary for the jet thermal launching model to work . the first _",
    "condition is _ that the strongly shocked gas in the bl cools slowly so that the thermal pressure have enough time to accelerate the jet s material .",
    "the second condition requires that weakly shocked blobs in the bl expand and disturb it in such a way that a strong shock develops .",
    "sr03 term such strong shocks ` spatiotemporally localized ( but not too small ! ) accretion shocks ' , or splashes .",
    "the characteristic radiative cooling time in the bl is equal to the photon diffusion time @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the vertical scale height , @xmath14 the density , @xmath15 the opacity , and @xmath16 the speed of light , whereas the ejection time is given by the dynamical time @xmath17 where @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the distance to the disc s center .    using the the mass conservation equation @xmath20 , taking for the radial velocity @xmath21 and and taking into account the strong shock density - contrast condition one obtains @xmath22",
    "therefore for accreting white dwarfs ( @xmath23 ) the condition @xmath24 is satisfied for @xmath25 which is satisfied for the nova - like stars and dwarf - novae at maximum , i.e. for cvs at highest accretion rate .",
    "however , in these systems one observes only winds , not jets .",
    "the model assumes that hundreds of small blobs are formed in the sheared bl ( section 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the blobs occasionally collide with each other , and create shocks which cause the shocked regions to expand in all directions . if the shocked regions continue to expand out into the path of yet more circulating blobs , stronger shocks may be created , as was proposed by @xcite to explain the emission of x - rays out of disk bls in dwarf novae .",
    "for the shocked blobs to expand , the radiative cooling time of _ individual blobs _ , @xmath26 , must be longer than their adiabatic expansion time @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the size of an expanding blob , and @xmath29 the post - shock blob s density .",
    "this condition also leads to a minimum value for the mass accretion rate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . 12 in sl04 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radius from where the jet is launched",
    ". for accreting white dwarfs the weak - shock temperature @xmath32 k. therefore also in this case @xmath33@xmath34 g@xmath35 ( sl04 ) .",
    "the strong - shock formation condition for accreting white dwarfs is @xmath36 this is roughly two to three orders of magnitude larger than the _ maximal _ accretion rate in cvs ( the accretion rate of nova - like stars and dwarf - novae at maximum is always @xmath37 ) .",
    "the condition ( [ accwd2 ] ) provides therefore an explanation for the absence of jets in cvs .    as mentioned in the introduction this explanation",
    "is strengthened by the fact that white - dwarf systems accreting at rates satisfying eq.([accwd2 ] ) _ do show _ jets . in ssxss",
    "white dwarfs accrete at rates of @xmath38 from a companion , and sustain nuclear burning on their surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in symbiotic systems , white dwarfs accrete at high rates from the wind of red giant branch stars or asymptotic giant branch stars . in some of the symbiotic systems which blow jets the white dwarf sustains a quasi - steady nuclear burning , similar to ssxss ; in others , there is no nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that conditions during the jet ejection by v1494 aql are consistent with condition eq .",
    "( [ accwd2 ] ) .",
    "he estimated the accretion rate to be then @xmath39 . to be really consistent with our model",
    ", the white dwarf should be accreting from a disc during jet production .",
    "the disc is most probably destroyed during the nova explosion and reforms during the decline . in v1494",
    "aql the accretion disc would have to be present during the  transition phase \" , three months after the maximum .",
    "this is rather rapid compared to another fast nova gq mus in which the disc reappeared only after a decade when the x - ray source had turned off @xcite , but still another fast nova v1974 cyg might have shown a disc signature some thirty months after the outburst @xcite .",
    "the thermal model elucidates why there exists a critical accretion rate necessary for jet launching .",
    "this critical rate is well above the maximum rate encountered in cvs and so solves the mystery of their jet quietness .",
    "one could argue that this is just a coincidence .",
    "the critical value could , for example , correspond to the appearance of a large - scale ( poloidal ) magnetic field necessary for a @xcite  type mechanism to work , as proposed by @xcite . according to these authors , at a critical rate",
    "the accretion disc would switch from a standard radiative disc to a state where most of the accretion energy is released in the form of a bulk flow . for the time being",
    "no mhd simulation is capable to follow such a process ( see the article by balbus in these proceedings ) , and the value of the critical accretion rate ( if any ) can be only matter of speculation .",
    "@xcite suggested that the inner parts of the nova - like star discs are underluminous because of the transition into an outflow phase .",
    "this would imply a critical accretion rate of @xmath40 .",
    "however , this rate corresponds rather to launching of winds , not of a jets , and the mystery of their absence in cvs would be still with us .",
    "it should be also noted that the alleged luminosity deficit in the inner disc of nova - like stars could be ( at least in part ) just an artefact of the disc model used @xcite . in any case",
    "the existence of a critical accretion rate for the presence of large - scale poloidal field would not be necessarily in contradiction with our criterion eq .",
    "( [ accwd2 ] ) which is only a necessary condition for jet launching . on the other hand ,",
    "if the poloidal field is generated at the cost of local energy dissipation thermal jet launching could be problematic .",
    "finally , our model has the vocation to be universal despite the fact that we use properties of the boundary layer which would not exist when accretion occurs onto black holes or strongly magnetized stars .",
    "however , the boundary layer is important only because it is where strong shocks can be produced .",
    "the required strong gradients could be also produced in accretion discs by  magnetospheric \" mhd even when the central object is a black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in such a case mhd instabilities , turbulence , or other disturbances may lead to strong shocks ; the high post - shock pressure may accelerate gas and form jets and/or winds , e.g. , as was shown for non - radiative accretion around a black hole by @xcite .",
    "scaled to the case of an accreting black hole eq .",
    "( [ acc01 ] ) becomes @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the eddington accretion rate .",
    "in @xcite we mistakenly claimed that this formula might be relevant to the appearance of steady jets ( we friedrich meyer for pointing this out at the present conference ) .",
    "it remains to be seen how and when the thermal jet - launching model applies to systems with black hole , but we expect that in the case of microquasars it would be rather relevant to the launching of powerful , high lorentz - factor jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?"
