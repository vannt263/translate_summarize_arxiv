    "it is a generally recognized fact that , independently of the underlying physics , an instability of the background is a prerequisite for the emergence of regular or random rogue waves ( see , e.g. , the discussion in  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in its turn ,",
    "the instability is determined , on the one hand , by the interplay between the dispersion and nonlinearity , and , on the other hand , by the competition between losses and gain , if an open system is considered . in this latter case",
    ", one can speak about _ dissipative rogue waves _",
    "@xcite , which are identified by an enhanced probability of generating high - amplitude pulses .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned generic situations , there exist special dissipative systems obeying the so - called parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry , i.e. , featuring spatially separated and exactly balanced gain and loss .",
    "these systems are described by non - hermitian hamiltonians , which may have purely real spectra of eigenvalues , provided that the strength of the anti - hermitian part of the hamiltonian ( which accounts for the balanced gain and loss ) does not exceed a certain critical value  bender1998,c : bender2007 .",
    "optics represents a unifying framework for a variety of wave phenomena . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath0-symmetry was experimentally implemented in coupled optical waveguides  @xcite .",
    "moreover principles of its implementation in plasmonic waveguides  @xcite and in a gaseous mixtures of resonant atoms  @xcite , were recently proposed . on the other hand , optical rogue waves",
    "have also been observed in some settings  @xcite and predicted in others , such as periodic arrays of waveguides  @xcite . while the original ideas of the use of the @xmath0 symmetry in quantum mechanics imply complex potentials obeying condition @xmath1 @xcite ( hereafter the overbar stands for complex conjugation ) , in the experimental realization  @xcite and numerous theoretical studies nonlinear dual - core waveguides ( _ couplers _ ) , with one core carrying the gain and the other one being lossy , were explored as an optical implementation of the @xmath0-symmetric systems .",
    "the dual - core systems are described by systems of coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlses ) , one with the gain and the other  with loss .",
    "these models and their generalizations in a form of sequence of couplers give rise to bright  @xcite and dark  @xcite solitons , vortices  @xcite , breathers  barashenkov2 , and describe a switch for solitons between the cores  akos .    as concerns optical rogue waves , there are two major directions of the work in this field .",
    "the first relates rogue events to the well - known process of supercontinuum generation @xcite in optical fibers .",
    "the soliton dynamics affects the supercontinuum generation process at a very early stage , _",
    "viz_. , the fission  of higher - order solitons @xcite , which is followed by multiple interactions of solitons with dispersive waves at advanced stages @xcite .",
    "in particular , the strongest - raman - shifted solitons @xcite were proposed as possible candidates for rogue waves @xcite .",
    "crests of soliton collisions were proposed too , as alternative candidates @xcite . recently , ",
    "long - lasting \" accelerating optical rogue waves with an oblong shape , resembling the shape of their oceanic counterparts , were reported dribenbabushkin , demircan .",
    "another approach @xcite is based on solutions for akhmediev breathers @xcite , and , in particular , on the single - peak solution often referred to as the peregrine soliton ( or peregrine rogue wave ) @xcite , which represents a _ deterministic rogue wave _",
    "@xcite generated by the nlse recently observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "these works reveal waves which arise from the modulational instability ( mi ) and subsequently disappear , which is consistent with the behavior of the famous ship killers in the ocean @xcite .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to study rogue waves in @xmath0-symmetric optical models based on the dual - core couplers .",
    "one of our goals is to introduce an analog of the peregrine soliton in this setting .",
    "more specifically , we are interested in how the presence of the balanced dissipation and gain , i.e. , the @xmath0 symmetry , affects the mi of the background and possibility of the creation of waves localized in space and time in such systems . in this context , it is relevant to mention a number of previous studies of the deterministic rogue waves carried out in the framework of the coupled nlses describing two - component matter waves in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , multi - parametric vector solitons , and , in particular , bright - dark - rogue waves  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is introduced in section ii , which is followed by the analysis of the mi of the continuous - wave ( cw ) solutions in section iii , and the study of rogue - wave solutions , following the pattern of the peregrine soliton , in section iv .",
    "exact analytical results , verified by direct simulations , for the stability of @xmath0-symmetric and antisymmetric solitons in the same system are reported in section v , and the paper is concluded by section vi .",
    "we consider a system of linearly coupled nlses for field variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath4which describes a set of two parallel planar waveguides , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being dimensionless propagation and transverse coordinates .",
    "accordingly , the initial - value problem corresponds to an optical beam shone into the waveguides input at given @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , the model describes a dual - core fiber coupler , where @xmath6 plays the role of the temporal variable @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eq : nls_gen1 ] ) and ( [ eq : nls_gen2 ] ) are coupled nonlinearly by the cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) @xmath8 , and linearly by the last terms with respective coupling constant scaled to be @xmath9 .",

    "( [ eq : nls_gen2 ] ) . in optics",
    ", this setting can be realized using a system of two lossy parallel - coupled waveguides , doped by gain - providing atoms , in which only one waveguide is pumped by the external source of light providing the gain .",
    "although the first core carries the gain , its linear coupling to the lossy mate makes the zero state in the system neutrally stable , allowing for propagation of linear waves .",
    "this is the well - known situation , which takes place if the gain / loss term is small enough , compared to the linear coupling through which the energy is transferred from the core with the gain to the lossy one , or , more specifically , when @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , modes can be excited in the system by input beams but do not arise spontaneously .",
    "below , without the loss of generality , we restrict the consideration to this case , and therefore introduce a convenient parametrization , @xmath12    following  ref .",

    "<S> we considered the modulational instability of continuous - wave backgrounds , and the related generation and evolution of deterministic rogue waves in the recently introduced parity - time ( @xmath0)-symmetric system of linearly - coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations , which describes a kerr - nonlinear optical coupler with mutually balanced gain and loss in its cores . besides the linear coupling </S>",
    "<S> , the overlapping cores are coupled through cross - phase - modulation term too . </S>",
    "<S> while the rogue waves , built according to the pattern of the peregrine soliton , are ( quite naturally ) unstable , we demonstrate that the focusing cross - phase - modulation interaction results in their partial stabilization . for @xmath0-symmetric and antisymmetric bright solitons , </S>",
    "<S> the stability region is found too , in an exact analytical form , and verified by means of direct simulations . </S>"
