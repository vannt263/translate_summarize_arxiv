    "for @xmath65 the hadronic current is longitudinally polarized , so the @xmath47 contribution is not enhanced by a @xmath80 pole , and is numerically small . since the wilson coefficients in @xmath30 combine into a @xmath1 independent overall factor , there is no gain in considering the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath65 .",
    "thus , to get maximal statistics one should use @xmath81 which is dominated by the @xmath82 term .",

    "<S> we point out that in inclusive @xmath0 decay an angular decomposition provides a third(@xmath1 dependent ) observable sensitive to a different combination of wilson coefficients than the rate and the forward - backward asymmetry . since a precise measurement of @xmath1 dependence requires large data sets , it is important to consider the data integrated over regions of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a strategy to extract all measurable wilson coefficients in @xmath0 from a few simple integrated rates in the low @xmath1 region . </S>",
    "<S> a similar decomposition in @xmath2 , together with the @xmath3 rate , also provides a determination of the wilson coefficients , without reliance on form factor models and without having to measure the zero of the forward - backward asymmetry . </S>"
