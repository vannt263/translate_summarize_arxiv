    ", fps has attracted much attention from experimentalists because it allows to generate correlated , and sometimes entangled , photon pairs in optical fibers @xcite .",
    "these fiber - optics photon - pair sources constitute a major progress in the development of quantum photonics because they offer the advantage of being compact guided - wave sources that can be easily connected ( with only marginal losses ) to standard transmission fibers .",
    "this constitutes an important advantage for applications in fiber quantum communication ( quantum key distribution @xcite , remote coin tossing @xcite ) and fiber quantum computation @xcite .",

    "@xcite gives a quantum description of fps in the _ scalar _ case , where the pump photons and the photon pairs share the same polarization .",
    "that treatment is restricted to a single monochromatic pump ( degenerate case , @xmath6 ) and was generalized later @xcite to account for the spectral shape of short pump pulses .",
