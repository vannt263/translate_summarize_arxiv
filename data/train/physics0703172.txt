    "sustained interest in resonant magneto - optical effects in atomic vapors is due to their importance to fundamental physics but also to possibility of using these effects in numerous applications ( see  mor91,ale93,bud02,ale05 and references therein ) .",
    "besides the obvious dependence on the applied magnetic field , the resonant nature of these effects implies a substantial dependence on the laser frequency .",
    "meanwhile , as a rule , only one or two of these parameters is varied in a given experimental measurement . in the present work ,",
    "we report the results of an investigation of the nonlinear hanle effect @xcite where both the laser frequency and the magnetic field were scanned continuously and simultaneously at different sequence rates @xcite .",
    "this technique enables us to acquire additional information in one measurement sequence , and can help to better understand and model the processes under study .",
    "this technique can be applied to other magneto - optical effects as well @xcite .",
    "usually , models of nonlinear magneto - optical effects are based on the optical bloch equations @xcite . at the same time , as was shown in blu04 , simpler rate equations for zeeman coherences for stationary or quasi - stationary excitation are equivalent to the optical bloch equations .",
    "the model based on the rate equations was successfully applied to studies of atomic interactions with laser radiation in cells in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the elaboration of a realistic model of the interaction of alkali atoms with laser radiation is complicated by the fact that the fine structure levels of a typical alkali atom consists of several hyperfine structure ( hfs ) levels that in experiments in cells can be only partially resolved spectroscopically due to doppler broadening .",
    "if an external magnetic field is applied , the situation becomes even more complicated .",
    "the magnetic field mixes together magnetic sublevels with the same magnetic quantum number @xmath6 , but belonging to different hyperfine states .",
    "this mixing can be quite strong , as was shown experimentally and confirmed in a model for rb atoms @xcite confined in an extremely thin cell @xcite . in that study the extremely thin cell allowed to resolve spectroscopically transitions between specific magnetic sublevels .",
    "when scanning the laser frequency there appeared in a fluorescence excitation spectrum transitions that would not be allowed in the absence of the level mixing due to magnetic field .    in the present study",
    "we propose to show that in the model of the nonlinear hanle effect we have for the first time accounted _ simultaneously _ for all these effects , namely , the creation of zeeman coherences between magnetic sublevels in the ground and excited states , the mixing of the different hyperfine levels in the magnetic field ( partial decoupling of the electronic angular momentum of the electrons from the nuclear spin ) , and the doppler effect in the manifold of magnetic sublevels of all hyperfine levels of the fine structure states involved .",

    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] shows the dependance of the fluorescence on the magnetic field in the vicinity of these peaks .",
    "the width of these high - contrast peaks is about @xmath44 g. in contrast , the fluorescence excited from the ground state hfs  level @xmath39 of @xmath5rb exhibits dips in the vicinity of zero magnetic field of approximately the same width as the previously discussed peaks . for each of the three doppler - overlapped groups of the three hfs transitions , sub - doppler dips appear at high laser intensity , located at the frequency positions of the two crossover resonances linked by the cycling transitions .",
    "as was shown ( but not comprehensively explained ) in pap99 , these dips arise even if precautions are taken to eliminate the backward - reflected beam from the cell , as was done also in this work .",

    "the third set of data we analyzed was the dependance of the fluorescence on the external magnetic field @xmath121 for different laser light intensities .",
    "we chose to use a @xmath121-field scan that corresponded to the laser frequency @xmath134 . since the intensity of the laser light should be proportional to @xmath135 ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and",

    "the results of the comparison of the measured signals with the simulated curves are presented in fig .",
    "in our theoretical simulations as well as in the experimental results , we see qualitatively different changes in the fluorescence intensity for different excitation frequencies when the magnetic field is scanned . for some excitation frequencies the peaks in the vicinity of zero magnetic field are observed , while for other excitation frequencies dips are observed instead . in particular , in the case when excitation occurs from the ground state hfs level @xmath40 of @xmath5rb(see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) , we see a peak at @xmath140 . this dip is called a _",
    "bright resonance_. it typically occurs when the excitation scheme @xmath141 is executed . a detailed explanation of the mechanisms that lead to the formation of bright resonances is given in @xcite .    to use this mechanism to explain the peaks in the signals simulated and measured for excitation of @xmath5rb atoms from the @xmath40 and @xmath27rb atoms from the @xmath41 ground state hfs levels we have to demonstrate that the respective transitions @xmath43 and @xmath142 give the main contribution to the fluorescence signal .",
    "let us perform this analysis for the absorption from the @xmath40 state to excited state levels @xmath143 of @xmath5rb .",
    "in the present experimental conditions , we can spectrally resolve ground - state hfs levels of rb and can not resolve excited - state hfslevels .",
    "two points are important to understand the formation of these bright resonances .",
    "first , for this excitation scheme the laser line - width ( @xmath144 mhz ) is small in comparison to the mean energy separation ( around @xmath145 mhz ) between excited state hfs levels . as a result",
    ", we can assume that different atoms in different velocity groups interact with laser light independently .",
    "besides taking into account the doppler contour width ( around @xmath146 mhz ) , we can assume that for a rather large detuning of the laser frequency from the exact resonance of any of the transitions @xmath147 , there still will be atoms in some velocity group that will be in resonance with the laser excitation as a result of the doppler shift .",
    "secondly , the ground state hfs levels for @xmath5rb have quantum numbers @xmath148 .",
    "the excited @xmath149 state has hfs levels with quantum numbers @xmath150 . for the transitions that start from the spectrally resolved ground - state level @xmath40 only the transition @xmath43 is closed ( cycling ) .",
    "this means that atoms after the absorption of a photon can return only to the initial ground - state level @xmath151 and can not go to the other ground - state level @xmath39 , which does not interact with the laser light .",
    "the consequence of this situation is that after several absorption and fluorescence cycles , all atoms will be optically pumped to the @xmath39 level , except atoms with the velocity group that corresponds to the resonance with closed @xmath43 transition .",
    "this transition exhibits a bright resonance in the magnetic field .",
    "this is the reason why in the experiment , even when the laser radiation is detuned from the exact @xmath43 resonance to the resonance with open transitions for the atom at rest , we still observe bright resonances .",
    "this qualitative explanation of the mechanism of resonance formation is supported by the solution of the exact model .    in the case when excitation occurs for @xmath5rb from the ground - state hfs level @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) we observe dips in the vicinity of @xmath140 . this dip is called a _",
    "dark resonance_. it typically occurs when the excitation scheme is @xmath152aln01b , ren01,pap02 . for the excitation from the ground state",
    "hfs level @xmath41 in @xmath5rb the only closed transition is @xmath153 .",
    "similar to the previous case , one can argue that the dark resonances when atoms are excited from the @xmath39 in @xmath5rb should be attributed to this transition at any laser frequency within the doppler profile .",
    "in summary , we can conclude that the double scanning technique is a powerful tool to study simultaneously frequency and magnetic field dependence of nonlinear zero field level - crossing signals , the nonlinear hanle effect . in this report we wanted to draw attention to the extended possibilities offered by this technique .",
    "together with the improved model of the magneto - optical processes it allows efficient measurements of these signals and provides a rather detailed theoretical description of the signals that reproduces experimentally measured signals with high accuracy .",
