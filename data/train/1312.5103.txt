    "in addition to the connection to the hc test , the maximal @xmath53-thresholding test , by its nature of formulation , is related to the high - dimensional multivariate testing procedures , for instance , the tests proposed by @xcite and @xcite . while these tests can maintain accurate size approximation under a diverse range of dimensionality and column - wise dependence , their performance is hampered when the nonzero means are sparse and faint .",
