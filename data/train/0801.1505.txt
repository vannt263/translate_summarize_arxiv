    "the relation between the rotation velocity and luminosity of disk galaxies , commonly known as the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , is one of the most fundamental properties of disk galaxies .",
    "this is because it is a link between luminous mass ( i.e. baryons ) and dynamical mass ( baryons and dark matter ) and because it has very little intrinsic scatter @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , unlike the faber - jackson relation for early type galaxies , the scatter in the tf relation is _ independent _ of surface brightness , size , or offsets from the size - luminosity relation ( courteau & rix 1999 ; courteau 2007 ) .",
    "cdm based disk galaxy formation models are able to reproduce the slope , and in some cases the amount of scatter , in the tf relation .",
    "however , a long standing problem has been the matching of the zero point of the tf relation , with the generic problem of galaxies rotating too fast at a given luminosity .",
    "this has been seen in analytic models ( van den bosch 2000 ; mo & mao 2000 ; dutton 2007 ) , semi - analytic models ( e.g. benson 2003 ) and cosmological n - body simulations ( e.g. eke , navarro , & steinmetz 2001 )",
    "the problem of matching the zero point of the tf relation is made worse when additional constraints , such as disk sizes and number densities , are placed on the models .",
    "semi - analytic models that are able to simultaneously reproduce the tf zero point and lf require that @xmath1 ( e.g. somerville & primack 1999 ) or @xmath2 ( e.g. croton 2006 ) .",
    "that is , these do not account for halo contraction , or the self - gravity of the disk . here",
    "@xmath3 is the observed rotation velocity ( corrected for inclination and other observational effects ) , @xmath4 is the halo circular velocity at the virial radius , and @xmath5 is the maximum circular velocity of the dark matter halo in the absence of dynamical evolution .",
    "bullock ( 2001 ) showed that @xmath6 for typical halo concentrations in a @xmath7cdm cosmology .",
    "support for @xmath8 also comes from more direct observational based measurements of halo masses ( eke 2006 ) and the velocity function of isolated halos ( blanton 2007 ) .",
    "thus , in the absence of baryonic effects , there appears to be reasonable agreement between theory and observation .",
    "problems occur when the contribution of the baryons to rotation curve and the effect of halo contraction ( blumenthal 1986 ) are taken into account .",
    "these effects increase the observed rotation velocity , and typically result in @xmath9 ( e.g. navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; dutton 2007 ) .    .",
    "these models are constructed to reproduce the velocity - luminosity - radius scaling relations as well as the relation between concentration and virial mass in @xmath7cdm .",
    "the upper / lower panels show models with / without the effect of halo contraction .",
    "the halo contraction model requires a low - mass halo , in conflict with observations , and a high spin parameter , in conflict with theoretical expectations .",
    "by contrast the no contraction model satisfies the halo mass constraint and uses a realistic galaxy spin parameter.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=68.0% ] .",
    "these models are constructed to reproduce the velocity - luminosity - radius scaling relations as well as the relation between concentration and virial mass in @xmath7cdm .",

    "by contrast the no contraction model satisfies the halo mass constraint and uses a realistic galaxy spin parameter.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=68.0% ]      as an illustration of the problem we consider the idealized case of an exponential disk embedded in an nfw halo .",
    "we pick @xmath10 , then from the tf relation ( courteau 2007 ; pizagno 2007 ) we know the typical i - band luminosity , which is converted into a stellar mass using typical galaxy colors and the relations in bell ( 2003 ) . from the size - luminosity relation ( pizagno 2005 ; courteau 2007 ) we know the average scale length of the galaxy . from cosmological simulations",
    "we know the average concentration parameter of dark matter halos of a given mass ( bullock 2001 ; macci 2007 ) . here",
    "we assume the wmap 3rd year cosmology ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this model is fully specified , and we can solve for the virial mass ( including the self gravity of the baryons and halo contraction ) . the resulting rotation curve is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this galaxy has @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total rotation velocity at 2.2r@xmath14 .",
    "we now discuss the three possible solutions to this problem .    * lowering the stellar mass to light ratio : * this reduces the contribution of the disk to @xmath13 , which thus induces less halo contraction . for our fiducial galaxy , a @xmath15 reduction of 0.2 dex",
    "is required .",
    "there is no observationally supported imf that would achieve this , and most dynamical estimates of galaxy masses suggest baryons ( disks and bulges ) contribute substantially ( i.e. at least half the mass ) to @xmath13 ( courteau & rix 1999 ; weiner 2001 ; bershady in these proceedings ) .    *",
    "lowering the initial halo concentration : * this preserves the inner structure of the halo while increasing its virial radius and thus reducing @xmath16 .",
    "however , for @xmath17 an initial concentration of @xmath18 is required .",
    "such low halo concentrations require cosmological parameters inconsistent with the wmap 3rd year constraints ( spergel 2007 ) .    * turning off or reversing halo contraction * : our model matches the @xmath16 constraint if we turn off halo contraction .",
    "a net halo expansion would be required if we were to adopt a smaller disk scale length .",
    "for isolated halos with smooth cooling the halo contracts . this",
    "is well tested and well understood ( e.g. sellwood & mcgaugh 2005 ; choi 2006 ) . however , in the hierarchical structure formation paradigm disk galaxies are not expected to form from smooth cooling in isolated non - evolving halos .",
    "since cosmological simulations are still unable to make realistic disk galaxies that follow the scaling relations between rotation velocity , luminosity and size ( see courteau in this proceedings ) , something must be missing .",
    "numerical resolution is certainly still an issue , but more importantly , key physics relating to gas cooling , star formation , and feedback is not yet understood .        * * feedback : * if disks form adiabatically and a large fraction of the disk mass is removed rapidly then net halo expansion can result ( e.g. gnedin & zhao 2002 ) .",
    "if this process is repeated several times a substantial reduction in halo density can be achieved ( read & gilmore 2005 ) .",
    "feedback also offers a mechanism to explain why galaxy formation is so inefficient , since cooling is very efficient in galaxy mass halos ( e.g. van den bosch 2002 ) . * * angular momentum exchange : * dynamical friction between baryons and dark matter can cause the halo to expand",
    ". this process can occur both in a formed disk through bars ( weinberg & katz 2002 ; sellwood 2006 ) , or during the formation process via large baryonic clumps ( el zant 2001 ; mo & mao 2004 ; tonini 2006 ) .",
    "a potential problem for the angular momentum exchange solution occurs if the baryons lose too much angular momentum , then the resulting disks will be too small .",
    "furthermore , as baryons lose angular momentum and move to smaller radii they will drag in the dark matter halo , which may cancel out the halo expansion achieved through the angular momentum exchange .",
    "feedback can help solve these problems by ejecting ( low angular momentum ) material from the centers of galaxies and causing the halo to expand ."
