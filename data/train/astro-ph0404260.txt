    "both objects are presumed from their steep spectral energy distributions to be class i protostars ( cohen et al .",
    "1984 ) , that is , they are in a very early stage of evolution preceding the t tauri star ( tts ) or so - called class ii phase , and in the process of actively accreting material from their protostellar disks . the dynamical age of hh24 is of the order of @xmath12  yr ( eislffel & mundt 1997 ; snell & edwards 1982 ) , which implies that the class i objects powering those flows must be very young , and also in a very short - lived phase of evolution .    in the past , the bright hh24a knot was interpreted as the `` working surface '' or bow shock for one of those outflows ( mundt et al . 1991 ; solf 1987 ) , but it is now recognized ( e.g. , eislffel & mundt 1997 ) to be the terminus of an independent outflow , which originates in a region immediately to the southwest , at the location of a deeply embedded class  0 protostar , hh24-mms . class  0 objects like hh24-mms represent the main accretion phase for protostars and are extremely rare because their lifetimes are so short .",
    "hh24-mms is observed directly at near - infrared wavelengths only in shocked h@xmath11 ( bontemps , ward - thompson , & andr 1996 ; davis et al .",

    ", it has been proposed that the outflow is confined and driven by interactions between the magnetosphere of the protostar and the primordial field that threads its accretion disk ( e.g. , shu et al .",

    "the latter , as well as ssv59 , is generally regarded as a class  i protostar ( e.g. , bontemps et al . 1995 , davis et al . 2002 ) .",

    "2001 ; phillips et al . 2001 ) nor a molecular core ( e.g. , torrelles et al . 1989 ; gibb & heaton 1993 ) .    the same process that drives the outflows and jets of young stellar objects ( ysos ) is expected to result in the repeated shearing and reconnection of the magnetic field lines that attach such a star to its circumstellar disk , and thereby to generate a substantial amount of x - ray emission ( hayashi , shibata , & matsumoto 1996 ; shu et al .",
    "1997 ; goodson , winglee , & bhm 1997 ) .",
    "the numerical simulations of hayashi et al . and goodson et al .",
    "in particular demonstrated that as a consequence of reconnection events some of the magnetically entrapped gas that is close to an accreting yso ( not necessarily its outflowing jet ) will reach temperatures as high as 100 mk and will be flung outwards , away from the star .",
    "such high temperatures should give rise to hard x - ray spectra .",
    "x - ray emission at equally high temperatures can also be produced in an accretion shock at the footpoints of the magnetic field , where infalling material from the disk streams down onto the surface of the forming star ( uchida & shibata 1984 ) .",
    "the hh2426 region was observed in x - rays with asca for a net exposure time of 30 kiloseconds ( ks ) by ozawa et al .",
    "the strongest source in the soft x - ray band ( 0.72.0 kev ) in that observation was ssv61 , a t  tauri star ( tts ) which is embedded in an unusual patch of nebulosity situated mid - way on the sky between hh24 and hh2526 ( e.g. , scarott , gledhill , & warren - smith 1987 ) .",

    "walter 1986 ; martn et al .",
    "the brightest emission in the hard asca band ( 2.08.0 kev ) is located north of ssv61 , in the vicinity of hh24 .",
    "the high - energy peak lies nearest ssv63 , but can not be identified unambiguously with either of its infrared components due to the low spatial resolution of asca .",
    "ozawa et al . noted the great difficulty of separating the x - ray flux of ssv63 from that of ssv61 , given their offset of just @xmath19 , at roughly the half - power radius of asca .",
    "the quiescent luminosity @xmath20 ergs  s@xmath3  they derive for ssv63 places it above the top end of the range thus far observed for all but a few class i objects , by factors of 50100 ( carkner , kozak , & feigelson 1998 ; preibisch , neuhuser , & stanke 1998 ) . whether ssv63 is truly one of the most x - ray luminous ysos in the sky , however , has awaited confirmation from high resolution imaging that resolves not only ssv61 from ssv63 , but also the individual infrared components of ssv63 itself .",
    "that task , including the requisite high precision astrometry , has now been accomplished by the _ chandra _ observations reported here .",
    "as for the class  0 sources in l1630 , ozawa et al . found no sign of x - ray emission at the position of hh24-mms , located in the saddle between the soft and hard x - ray peaks in their image , nor any emission at the position of hh25-mms , which was also in the asca field of view .",
    "their @xmath21 upper limit of @xmath22 ergs  s@xmath3  is not a stringent limit on the emission , however , since ysos elsewhere in orion and in other star forming regions have been detected at much fainter levels , @xmath23 ergs  s@xmath3  ( e.g. , feigelson et al .",

    ", we have undertaken a far more sensitive search for the onset of x - ray emission in the class 0 objects within the l1630 cloud .",
    "our objective was to establish an evolutionary progression in x - ray properties within a single cloud , and to examine the possible relationship between protostellar x rays , accretion disks , magnetically confined jets , and large - scale molecular outflows .",
    "taking advantage of the lower background , greater sensitivity , and unsurpassed spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , we are now able to set a 10 times smaller bound on possible x - ray emission from the three established class 0 protostars in the l1630 cloud , hh24-mms , hh25-mms , and lbs17-h .",
    "l1630 was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer array ( acis : garmire et al .",
    "2002 ) on the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ for a net exposure time ( livetime ) of 62.8 ks .",
    "the date of observation was 1415 november 2002 .",
    "all six detector chips of the acis - s camera , s0s5 , were activated during the observation .",
    "the aim point of the observation was chosen to place ssv61 close to the center of the back - illuminated s3 chip and to put hh24 and hh2526 on the same device within a few arcminutes of the optical axis of the telescope , thereby ensuring the best optical performance for our highest priority targets within the acis field of view .",
    "the roll angle of the observation , @xmath24 , was selected to position the ngc 2068 reflection nebula , located to the northeast of hh2426 , on the back - illuminated s1 chip of the detector array and the class 0 object , ngc 2068/lbs17-h ( gibb & little 2000 ) , on the adjacent , front - illuminated s2 chip . the majority of the field of view is shown in fig .",

    "the approximate locations of hh objects in the neighboring areas are marked , as are the positions of the two dozen x - ray sources we have detected in our _ chandra _ observation .",
    "to analyze the _",
    "image , we initially filtered the level-2 x - ray event file provided by the pipeline data processing system , retaining only the photon events that were assigned asca grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 and that were within the broad ( 0.510 ) kev energy band in which the acis detector has its highest response and the background radiation is at its lowest levels .",
    "subsequent steps in the analysis , including photometry and astrometry , were carried out following various data analysis threads within ciao , the interactive _ chandra _ data analysis package .",
    "for source detection , we applied the celldetect sliding - cell detection algorithm .",
    "twenty - five sources , all of them point - like , were found on the six chips . to extract x - ray counts for each source",
    ", we used the dmextract tool .",
    "we employed a circular extraction region with a radius of 10 pixels ( @xmath25 ) to measure the brightness of sources located within 7  of the optical axis of the telescope , a radius twice as large for sources more than 7  off - axis , and an annulus at least 10 times as large to evaluate the background emission .",
    "the results of the photometry are given in table 1 .",
    "listed there are the right ascension and declination ( j2000 ) of each source , its off - axis angle , the net source counts extracted within the 0.510 kev band , and the statistical errors in the source counts . in the final column",
    "we tabulate the count rate for the effective exposure time of each source , which takes account of the variations in the sensitivity of the camera across the field of view , as indicated by our exposure map calculations .",
    "the adjustments are negligible for the nearly on - axis sources on the s3 chip that are the main interest of the present study , but may be as great as 50% for the few objects that are located either near the edge of a detector chip or else far away from the optical axis of the telescope",

    "the fainter infrared component of ssv63w , located 2  farther north ( see fig .",
    "2 of davis et al .",
    "2002 ) , appears dark in x rays .",
    "ssv63ne is a source of both radio emission and x - ray emission , but has no near - infrared counterpart ( as we will show below in  2.2 ) .",
    "if not a distant background object , it may qualify on that basis as an extreme class i or possible class  0 yso .",
    "all three components of ssv63 have hard x - ray spectral indices : 96% of the x - ray photons detected from ssv63w have pulse - height energies greater than 2 kev , while all of those detected for ssv63e and ne have energies of 2 kev or more .",
    "we performed individual @xmath27 timing analyses for the three x - ray components , using the xronos software package from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) of the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
    "we found no indication of variability on timescales of 6 ks or longer , certainly nothing comparable in amplitude or duration to the order - of - magnitude outburst in x - ray flux recorded by asca ( ozawa et al .",
    "the x - ray count rates listed in table 1 therefore likely correspond to the quiescent activity levels of those sources .",
    "changes on timescales shorter than 6 ks were not investigated owing to the faintness of the sources .",
    "the strongest x - ray source in the _ chandra _ field of view was the wtts , ssv61 , for which we accumulated very nearly 13,000 counts in the 0.510 kev bandpass .",
    "the x - ray light curve of ssv61 was stable throughout the entire observation ; various @xmath27 tests performed with xronos found no evidence of variability on timescales greater than 300 s. to analyze the x - ray spectrum of ssv61 , we used the heasarc xspec spectral analysis package in order to fit simple multi - temperature thermal plasma models to the pulse height distribution of the extracted photons .",
    "the quality of the fit was determined by @xmath27 minimization . in the calculations",
    ", we removed a small ( @xmath28 ) contribution of emission from the background and also updated the instrumental response function to compensate for the on - orbit decline in the low - energy sensitivity of the acis detectors .    in terms of the reduced @xmath27 value of the fit",
    ", no satisfactory model was found .",
    "typical of the results we obtained are the following parameters for a two - temperature , reduced - metal mekal fit ( mewe , kaastra , & liedahl 1995 ) , which we matched to the observed counts in the 0.57.0 kev pulse - height energy channels : reduced @xmath29 ; @xmath30 kev , @xmath31 kev ; one - third solar elemental abundance , z = @xmath32 ; hydrogen column density , n@xmath33 @xmath34 ; volume emission measure , @xmath35 , three - quarters of which are due to the high - temperature component ; broadband flux at earth , @xmath36(0.310 kev ) = @xmath37 ergs  @xmath34  s@xmath3 ; and intrinsic ( absorption - corrected ) x - ray luminosity for an assumed distance of 450 pc , @xmath1(0.310 kev ) = @xmath38 ergs  s@xmath3 . here , @xmath39(=254 ) is the number of degrees of freedom in the model .",
    "closely similar fits were obtained with both the xspec pileup model ( see davis 2001 ) , which we used to account for the @xmath40% pileup fraction in our spectrum of ssv61 , and also the apec plasma emission code described by smith et al .",
    "an example of an apec model fit is shown in fig .",
    "3 . except for a few possible camera artifacts ,",
    "the largest residuals in all the model fits are attributable to excess emission in the observed spectrum near photon energies of 1 kev .",
    "the apparent excess may be due to lines of ne ix and x or to inner shell transitions of high ionization stages of fe .",
    "a similar excess has also been observed in the acis spectra of pre - main sequence stars in other star - forming regions , e.g. , orion and @xmath10 ophiuchus ( feigelson et al .",
    "2002 ; imanishi , tsujimoto , & koyama 2002 ) .",
    "an evaluation of the intrinsic 0.310 kev brightness of ssv61 for a variety of xspec models produced very nearly the same results for the x - ray flux and for the luminosity .",
    "the various models also yielded closely similar amounts for the hydrogen column density . from the models and the empirical relation of bohlin , savage , & drake ( 1978 ) , we infer a visual extinction of @xmath41 mag .",
    "our estimate , drawn from the _ chandra _ spectrum of ssv61 , is a factor of four less than the extinction ozawa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) derived from their asca observation , but is consistent with the conclusion reached by strom et al .",
    "( 1975 ) on the basis of infrared colors that the foreground reddening to this star is relatively small .",
    "infrared spectroscopy ( discussed below ) further confirms the low extinction for this star .",
    "the three x - ray sources identified with ssv63 were too faint for detailed spectral model fitting , and so we limited ourselves to a few simple models of the strongest component , ssv63w .",
    "for that source we chose an isothermal , one temperature ( 1-t ) mekal model , constrained it to a sub - solar abundance of z = 0.5 , and allowed xspec to search for values of n@xmath42 and @xmath43 that minimized the @xmath27 of the fit .",
    "the best - fit values derived by xspec were n@xmath44 @xmath34 ( equivalent to 48 mag of visible extinction ) and @xmath45 kev .",
    "the resulting hydrogen column density is at the low end of the range of values deduced by ozawa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , while our temperature is a factor of 3 lower than their best - fit value for a quiescent interlude in the asca observation . a reddened bremsstrahlung model , which we chose as an alternative fit , produced a similar @xmath27 , temperature , and n@xmath42 as the mekal model . both models , the mekal and the bremsstrahlung , yielded a comparable 0.310 kev flux and absorption - corrected luminosity for ssv63w : @xmath46 ergs  @xmath34  s@xmath3  and @xmath47 ergs  s@xmath3 . raising the temperature to a fixed value of @xmath48 kev for consistency with the asca result reduced the column density to @xmath49 @xmath34 , corresponding to an extinction of @xmath50 mag , but yielded a much poorer fit to the _ chandra _ pulse - height spectrum in terms of its @xmath27 value .",
    "no model analysis was possible for the two remaining components of ssv63 , given the small numbers of counts recorded for them during our _ chandra _ observation .",
    "to estimate x - ray luminosities for those sources , we scaled from ssv63w in proportion to the background - adjusted number of counts detected for each source . in doing so , we implicitly assumed that the optimal xspec models of ssv63e and ssv63ne would yield the same parameters as the best - fitting model for ssv63w .",
    "our normalization procedure is equivalent to using a counts - to - energy conversion factor ( ecf ) of @xmath51 ergs  @xmath34  s@xmath3  per count s@xmath3 for the x - ray flux observed at earth , and @xmath52 ergs  s@xmath3  per count s@xmath3 for the extinction - corrected broadband luminosity .",
    "anticipating the results of  3.2 , we note that sub - millimeter observations of l1630 corroborate the high extinction value provided by our x - ray analysis of ssv63w . on the other hand , spectroscopy of the infrared ice band in the direction of ssv63e and w ( discussed in  2.3 ) suggests that the foreground extinction towards both sources may be only half as large , @xmath53 mags .",
    "the apparent discrepancy raises the possibility that the x - ray sources may be more deeply obscured than are the near - infrared sources , reflecting , perhaps , an anomalous gas - to - dust ratio along the line of sight .",
    "the x - ray luminosities for ssv61 and ssv63 are summarized in table 2 .",
    "our @xmath1 value for ssv61 is 15% higher than the asca result of ozawa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) but lies substantially above the high end of the range found in an extensive survey of wtts in taurus by rosat ( neuhuser 1997 ) and is well above the range of x - ray luminosities measured by _",
    "chandra _ for low - mass stars in both ophiuchus ( imanishi et al .",
    "2001 ) and the orion nebula cluster ( feigelson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "our @xmath1 value for ssv63w falls near the top end of those three luminosity distributions , while the values for the two other detected class i ysos , ssv63e and 63ne , are in the top quartile of each range .",
    "also listed in the table are upper limits on the x - ray emission of the near - infrared objects ssv60 and 59 , the former lying between hh25c and 25d along the curving ribbon of emission knots that define hh25 ( being closer to d ) , the latter lying just north of hh26a .",
    "the upper limits on the count rates given in the table are three times the poisson uncertainties in the total counts ( uncorrected for background emission ) measured through a 10  diameter circular detection cell , which we centered on the respective 2mass positions listed in the second and third columns of the table .",

    ". the br@xmath0 line of at 4.05@xmath6 appears in emission in the spectrum of ssv61 ; its equivalent width is entirely consistent with the observed strength of h@xmath0 , case b recombination , and very little foreground reddening .",
    "both spectra exhibit deep absorption bands from the first overtone ro - vibrational transitions of co near 2.32.5@xmath6 . assuming the observed atomic and molecular features are photospheric in origin , we have used their relative strengths to estimate the spectral type and luminosity class of the underlying stars in the manner described by kleinmann & hall ( 1986 ) , hodapp & deane ( 1993 ) , and greene & meyer ( 1995 ) .",
    "here we have adopted aspin s ( 2003 ) formulation , in which an atomic index formed by the sum of the equivalent widths of the doublet at 2.21@xmath6 and the triplet at 2.26@xmath6 is compared to a molecular index represented by the equivalent width of the @xmath64=20 co bandhead at 2.29@xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "according to their atomic and molecular index values , ssv60 ( 4.2 , 10.0 ) is definitely a giant , whereas ssv61 ( 5.9 , 9.4 ) is intermediate to a dwarf and giant ( a not uncommon finding for a tts ) .",
    "we have combined the spectral indices , the strengths of the various photospheric absorption lines of the metals , the deep co bandheads , and the general continuum shapes to estimate spectral classifications of k5m0iii for ssv60 and m0m2iii / v for ssv61 .",
    "those spectral types , resting solely on the infrared spectra , are consistent with the locations of both stars in a ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) color - color plot based on their 2mass photometry , and also with the effective temperatures we have derived following the procedure of greene & meyer ( 1995 ) , which makes use not only of the absorption line strengths but the broadband colors as well .",
    "the latter technique provides , among other things , an estimate of the fraction of excess light from veiling continuum emission , which we find to be constrained to low values for both stars ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 at @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "the association of ssv61 with the l1630 molecular cloud is hardly in question , but the same can not be said for ssv60 . with its bright , attendant nebula , ssv61 would be a rare star indeed to be in the far foreground of this region , while the absence of any ice absorption at 3.08@xmath6 in its infrared spectrum ( fig .",
    "6 ) argues against the likelihood it lies far behind the molecular cloud at a very considerable distance from earth . for an early m giant ,",
    "ssv60 is clearly much more heavily absorbed than ssv61 , as is apparent from its spectral energy distribution shortward of 2@xmath6 and its strong ice absorption band .",
    "the broad ice feature is common to the spectra of other sources which are either background to or deeply embedded within molecular clouds , where the ice has condensed onto dust grains but not undergone significant processing at high temperature ( smith , sellgren , & tokunaga 1989 ) . for ssv60 , the optical depth at band center , @xmath69 = 0.96 , leads ( according to the results of whittet et al .",

    "we conclude , therefore , that ssv60 is a background giant star that is unconnected either with l1630 or with hh25 , on which it is apparently coincidentally projected .",
    "the strong red continua and deep ice bands of hh26-ir , ssv59 , 63e , and 63w , on the other hand , suggest that each of those objects is deeply embedded within the l1630 cloud .",
    "their observed ice - band optical depths range from @xmath71 ( for hh26-ir ) to @xmath72 ( for ssv63e and w ) , corresponding to approximate @xmath73 values of 10 to 20 mags . at close inspection ,",
    "the ice band spectra of ssv59 and 63e also show a broad , shallow depression near 3.45@xmath6 .",
    "that feature , according to smith et al .",

    "emission lines from ro - vibrational transitions of h@xmath11 are present throughout the @xmath59-band spectra of ssv63w and hh26-ir , the 2.12@xmath6 @xmath77(1 ) line being the strongest ( fig .",
    "the same lines are often observed in the spectra of class i objects ( greene & lada 1996 ) .",

    "various explanations have been offered for the co lines : they may be formed in the innermost portion of a keplerian disk or in the neutral component of a stellar wind or outflow ( carr 1989 ; chandler , carlstrom , & scoville 1995a ; najita et al .",
    "alternatively , the emission may be produced by accretion of disk material onto the central star via a magnetic `` funnel flow '' ( martin 1997 ; see , however , najita et al .",

    "( 1997 ) have demonstrated that in some cases the co bands can be highly variable , perhaps even exhibiting periodic behavior .",

    "we detected x rays from none of the three class 0 ysos within the _ chandra _ field of view .",
    "two of those embedded objects , hh24-mms and hh25-mms , are continuum radio sources and therefore must have a component of ionized gas ; the third object , lbs17-h , has not been detected at radio wavelengths and hence may be in an earlier stage of evolution than the others , or else its radio emission is much more optically thick and therefore below current detection levels ( gibb 1999 ) .",
    "the radio spectral indices of 24-mms and 25-mms are slightly positive ( anglada et al .",
    "the indices are compatible with thermal free - free radiation ( reynolds 1986 ) , but do not definitively rule out a possible non - thermal gyrosynchrotron origin .",
    "we note that the spectral index for gyrosynchrotron emission is most often strongly negative but it can also be weakly positive , as for a thermal source ( e.g. , gdel 2002 ) . in the case of hh24-mms , the radio source is spatially resolved ( bontemps et al .",
    "1996 ; reipurth et al .",
    "therefore , it is almost certainly free - free emission from a warm ionized jet , although some portion of it may be thermal emission from dust ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we can suggest several plausible explanations to account for the dearth of x rays from the class  0 objects in l1630 : ( a ) assuming the three ysos are in the main phase of protostellar accretion , they may not yet have developed accretion shocks that are strong enough to heat infalling gas to the million degree temperatures that are needed to generate x rays , or else their magnetic fields may not be strong enough or sufficiently well organized on large scales to produce intense reconnection heating of the infalling gas ; ( b ) alternatively , if hot gas is now present around the star , the temperature of the gas may be sufficiently low ( below 12 mk ) that it emits only a very soft spectrum of x - ray photons , which is unable to penetrate the dense envelope that surrounds the growing protostar ; or ( c ) if there is x - ray emitting gas now present at temperatures that are high enough to form hard x  rays with energies of 210 kev , the extinction in the surrounding envelope and cloud may be sufficiently large to absorb most ( or all ) of the x - ray photons and to depress the emergent radiation below levels that _ chandra _ can detect .    here",
    "we address the last possibility .",
    "since , by definition , class 0 protostars are especially faint at near - infrared wavelengths , we do not have @xmath78 colors or irtf spectra for the class  0 ysos in l1630 from which we might estimate the foreground extinction to those objects . instead",
    ", we have estimated the line - of - sight extinction to each source by making use of the relationship between visible extinction and 850@xmath6 brightness given by mitchell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , @xmath79 .",
    "applying that expression in turn to the submillimeter data for hh24-mms , hh25-mms , and lbs17-h , we find @xmath73 estimates of 200 , 100 , and 86 mags , respectively . in each case , the derived extinction is larger than the value of 48 mags we previously adopted from our xspec model of the _ chandra _ spectrum of ssv63w .    given the foregoing extinction estimates , we have used the heasarc webpimms tool to predict a _ chandra _ detection limit for each class 0 yso , computing for each one the intrinsic x - ray luminosity that yields the observed @xmath4 count rate limit listed in table 2 . in our simulations , we have adopted a single - temperature thermal model for the x - ray emission and assumed a normal value of the gas - to - dust ratio in order to convert the submillimeter - based @xmath73 into a column density of n@xmath42 , following bohlin et al .",
    "guided by our xspec calculations , we have considered two different source temperatures which should bracket an adequate range of spectral hardness , @xmath48 kev and @xmath80 kev . in the high - temperature case , the tabulated count rate limits for hh24-mms , hh25-mms , and lbs17-h correspond to @xmath4 detection limits in @xmath81 of 30.30 , 30.00 , and 29.75 , respectively .",
    "the limits in @xmath81 for the low - temperature models are 0.3 dex higher . for both temperatures ,",
    "the predicted luminosity limits are far less than the intrinsic @xmath1 we derived from xspec models of the class  i object ssv63w , which we detected at @xmath82 .",
    "to have escaped detection at that @xmath1 , i.e. , to have resulted in fewer than @xmath83 net x - ray counts in our exposure time of 63 ks , the class 0 objects would each have to suffer more than 400 mags of extinction ( or else be intrinsically very much softer x - ray sources than we have assumed ) .",
    "therefore , to a very high significance level , it appears all three class  0 objects are intrinsically much fainter in x rays than 63w , even when the latter source is quiescent rather than flaring .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the eastern component of ssv63 , the class  i yso 63e , which we also detected with _",
    ", is comparable in strength to the luminosity upper limits for the class  0 objects .",
    "thus , we can further assert that the class  0 sources are fainter than 63e at the @xmath4 confidence level .",
    "on the other hand , because the two other established class  i objects in the same observation , ssv59 and hh26-ir , were not detected by _",
    "chandra _ , the x - ray brightness of individual class  i sources must have a wide range of values , even within the same star forming region . _ chandra _ observations of class i ysos elsewhere in orion ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "2002 ) and in ophiuchus ( imanishi et al .",
    "2001 ) bear that point out .",
    "thus , although the class  0 objects in l1630 are clearly fainter than _ some _ of the class  i objects in the same cloud , they may not be fainter than _ all _ of them . in terms of an evolutionary trend , until more is known about the lower range of @xmath1 values for class  i objects , and the extent to which such objects are variable , it is premature to draw any firm conclusions about whether the class  0 sources as a group are systematically less luminous in x rays than are the more advanced class  i sources which are their descendants .      the submillimeter map of mitchell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) leads to an @xmath73 estimate ( 47 mags ) for the combined ( spatially unresolved ) ssv63ew that is entirely in agreement with the extinction we have derived from our xspec modelling of the _ chandra _ spectrum of 63w .",
    "both the e and w infrared components of ssv63 were detected in x rays ; they are also both thermal radio emitters ( anglada et al .",
    "hh 26-ir was not detected in x rays , but may be a weak radio source according to gibb ( 1999 ) .",
    "ssv59 is neither an x - ray source nor a radio source .",
    "however , the near - infrared spectrum of ssv59 , as well as that of hh26-ir ( fig .",
    "6 ) , exhibits emission in the brackett lines of hydrogen , implying that both objects are associated with ionized gas .",
    "the presence of a resolved h@xmath11 jet appended to hh 26-ir ( davis et al .",
    "2002 ) suggests that its radio emission may originate from the jet and be thermal in nature ; the radio spectrum of ssv59 may be optically thick and thus undetectable .",
    "it is perhaps significant that the hh filaments and knots identified with the northern class  i ysos ( the various alphabetical components of hh24 ) are much more highly developed than the ones in the south ( hh2525 ) .",
    "this is perhaps an indication that the southern region is relatively younger and has not yet reached the age where its embedded ysos have formed strong radio sources or possess the million degree plasma required to produce x rays .",
    "the weak - line t tauri star ssv61 is by far the brightest source in our _ chandra _ image .",
    "it is also a highly variable radio source , which suggests a non - thermal origin for its radio flux ( anglada et al .",
    "1998 ; gibb 1999 ) . as we noted in  2.3",
    ", there is very little chance of our having greatly overestimated the distance and consequently the @xmath1 of this star . for an assumed distance of @xmath84 pc ,",
    "the radio and x - ray luminosities of ssv61 closely fit the @xmath85 relation for normal late - type giants , lying among the tidally locked binaries at the top end of the activity range ( drake , simon , & linsky 1989 ; dempsey et al .",
    "this may be an indication that ssv61 is itself a close binary . in any event , it is safe to say that the emissions of this star at radio as well as x - ray wavelengths are coronal in origin .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum and 2mass colors of ssv61 in a ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) two - color plot are consistent with those of a lightly reddened and lightly veiled early m giant star , for which @xmath86 mags .",
    "however , the observed infrared magnitudes , combined with the bolometric correction for an early m giant ( @xmath87 , b.c.@xmath88 = 2.60 mags ) , imply a very high luminosity , @xmath89 , which places the star well above the stellar birthline at a logarithmic effective temperature of @xmath90 = 3.53.6 ( stahler 1983 ; mercer - smith , cameron , & epstein 1984 ) . at that @xmath91 ,",
    "the ratio of the x - ray to the bolometric luminosity of ssv61 is at the saturation limit for the coronal x - ray emission of late - type stars , @xmath92 . that maximum x - ray brightness limit is well established from observations of many different kinds of late - type stars , among them wtts like ssv61 , and so any substantial reduction in our @xmath91 estimate for",
    "ssv61 would make it all the more difficult to understand the origin of its intense x - ray brightness . on the other hand , as one might surmise from the optical polarimetry of scarrott et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , the 2mass photometry of ssv61 may be heavily contaminated by scattered light from the nebulosity that is present on all sides of the star . a large proportion of the near - infrared light of the more deeply embedded class  i objects",
    "is thought to be contributed by scattering in the protostellar envelope ( kenyon et al .",
    "in that instance the scattering adds no continuum veiling to the spectrum of the central star itself ( calvet et al .",
    "the same scattering mechanism , applied to ssv61 , would therefore be consistent with the low veiling ratio we have determined from our spex observation of ssv61 .    in the submillimeter map of mitchell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , there is an 850@xmath6 peak that coincides in position with ssv61 .",
    "the value of @xmath73 implied by the submillimeter flux is 40 mags or more , which is inconsistent with the near absence of reddening established by the infrared colors and ice - band spectrum of ssv61 .",
    "this suggests that the cold dust producing the 850@xmath6 peak is most likely located behind ssv61 and that the star sits in front of the cloud , possibly illuminating its front face .    in the infrared color - color plot , the 2mass colors of ssv60 place this star on the reddening line for late - type giants , consistent with the spectral classification we obtained from our irtf spectrum .",
    "however , the bright near - infrared magnitudes of this star ( @xmath93 ) , coupled with the large extinction implied by the deep 3@xmath6 ice band we have observed ( @xmath70 ) , can not be reconciled with membership in l1630 .",
    "the best match we can find for the spectral type , the ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) colors , the large amount of reddening , and the near - infrared magnitudes are for an early m background giant , which is located beyond the l1630 cloud at a distance of @xmath96 kpc and with a luminosity of @xmath97 .",
    "we have acquired a deep x - ray image of the hh2426 region in the l1630 cloud with the acis - s camera on _ chandra _ , which has resulted in the detection of a number of anonymous 2mass infrared sources and optically visible h@xmath0 emission - line stars , including the x - ray luminous coronal source , the wtts ssv61 .",
    "also detected at what appear to be their quiescent levels of activity are two deeply embedded class  i protostars ( ssv63e and w ) , which have been identified in earlier work as the source of energetic molecular and ionized flows in the region .",
    "the two were blended together in an earlier detection by asca , but are well separated at the much higher spatial resolution of _ chandra_. two other hh - associated class  i objects ( ssv59 and hh26-ir ) as well as three class  0 ysos in the same cloud ( hh24-mms , hh25-mms , and lbs 17-h ) were not detected .",
    "although x - ray observations of several different star forming regions thus far reveal a striking lack of class  0 detections , no firm conclusions can be drawn from our small sample of ysos regarding a possible evolutionary trend in the intrinsic x - ray luminosities of the class  0 and class  i protostars .",
    "x - ray emission was detected from a deeply embedded continuum radio source ( hh24ne ) , whose location within hh24 suggests that it may be the highly obscured driving source for one of the long hh filaments in this area .",
    "the object has no visible or near - infrared counterpart , and therefore is potentially a class  0 or extreme class  i object . +",
