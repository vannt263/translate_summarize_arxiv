    "binary pulsars with short orbital periods and massive companions exhibit a range of relativistic effects , the most prominent of which are relativistic periastron precession , gravitational time dilation , transverse doppler effects , orbit decay due to loss of energy to gravitational waves and the shapiro delay resulting from the passage of the pulsar signal through the gravitational field of the companion .",
    "these effects may be described by the so - called `` post - keplerian '' parameters @xcite and are most readily observed in double - neutron - star systems such as the hulse - taylor binary pulsar , psr b1913 + 16 @xcite and the double pulsar , psr j0737@xmath03039a / b @xcite .",
    "another relativistic effect which is potentially observable in such systems is the precession of the pulsar spin axis resulting from coupling between the spin and orbital angular momenta @xcite .",
    "the angular rate of precession , @xmath10 , is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gravitational constant , @xmath13 is the velocity of light , @xmath14 is the binary orbital period , @xmath15 is the orbital eccentricity and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the pulsar and companion masses respectively . for psr b1913 + 16",
    ", the expected rate from equation  ( [ eq : prec_freq ] ) is @xmath18 yr@xmath9 , corresponding to a precessional period of about 300 years , whereas for psr j0737@xmath03039a / b the rate is about a factor of four larger and the precessional period is about 75 years .    since the emission from pulsars",
    "is believed to be beamed , probably along the open field lines associated with the magnetic poles on the neutron star , precession of the pulsar spin axis will result in changes in the beam aspect as viewed from the earth .",
    "one would expect this to lead to changes in the observed pulse profile and changes attributed to this effect have indeed been observed in psr b1913 + 16 @xcite and psr b1534 + 12 @xcite . for psr b1913 + 16 , a significant fraction of the expected beam diameter has been traversed in the time since its discovery and this has been used to map the two - dimensional structure of the emission beam @xcite . because of its relatively short precessional period , similar effects were expected to be observable for the double pulsar , but surprisingly , they have not so far been observed in the a pulsar @xcite .",
    "a possible reason for this is that a s spin - orbit misalignment angle ( the angle between the spin and orbital angular momenta ) is small ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , large variations in the pulse profile and orbital visibility of pulsar b have been observed @xcite and these are certainly due to some combination of relativistic periastron precession and precession of the b spin axis .",
    "there is now direct evidence for the relativistic spin precession of pulsar b. the emission from pulsar a is eclipsed for about 30 seconds when it passes behind pulsar b @xcite with the eclipse profile showing modulation related to the spin period of pulsar b @xcite .",
    "modelling of the long - term variations in the eclipse profile are consistent with the relativistic precession of b s spin axis with a spin - orbit misalignment angle of about @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "psr j1141@xmath06545 is a 394-ms pulsar in an eccentric 4.7-h binary orbit with a relatively massive companion ( @xmath20  m@xmath21 ) discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey @xcite . with these characteristics ,",
    "relativistic effects are expected to be detectable and indeed , measurement of the relativistic advance of periastron was reported in the discovery paper .",
    "the expected rate of relativistic precession of the pulsar spin axis is 136 yr@xmath9 , corresponding to a precessional period of about 265 yr . unusually for such a binary system , the pulsar characteristic age is relatively low , about @xmath22 yr , suggesting that the initially more massive primary star evolved to form a white dwarf , the present companion star , and in the process transferred mass to the secondary which subsequently exploded leaving behind a neutron star , the present pulsar @xcite",
    ". continued timing observations @xcite reinforced these ideas and gave detections of relativistic time dilation and orbital decay which were consistent with the predictions of general relativity .",
    "a clear orbital modulation in the timescale for interstellar scintillation was detected by @xcite , giving estimates of the orbital inclination angle @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) @xmath25 and the system transverse space velocity , @xmath26  km  s@xmath9 . from measurements of the relativistic shapiro delay , @xcite derive a value for the inclination angle of @xmath27 , consistent with the scintillation measurement .",
    "observations at frequencies around 1.4 ghz by @xcite showed that the mean pulse profile for psr j1141@xmath06545 changed significantly over the five years from 1999 july to 2004 may ( mjd range 51381  53134 ) , with an approximately linear increase in @xmath28 , the pulse width at 10% of the pulse peak .",
    "furthermore , based on two measurments separated by about 0.7 yr , there appeared to be steepening of the gradient of polarization position angle ( pa ) @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the pa and @xmath31 is the pulse phase ( measured in the same units as the pa ) near the profile center , at a rate of @xmath32 yr@xmath9 .",
    "variations of pa across pulse profiles are often well described by the `` rotating - vector model '' ( rvm ) in which the emission is assumed to be polarized parallel ( or perpendicular ) to the projected direction of magnetic fields in the vicinity of a magnetic pole on the rotating neutron star @xcite . in the rvm",
    ", @xmath30 varies as @xmath33 @xmath34 is the pa at @xmath35 , the center of symmetry of the pa variation and the projected direction of the rotation axis for a dipole field , @xmath36 is the inclination of the observer s line of sight relative to the rotation axis of the star , @xmath37 is the inclination of the magnetic axis relative to the rotation axis and @xmath38 is the impact parameter of the observer s line of sight , that is , the minimum angle between the magnetic axis and the observer s line of sight which occurs at @xmath39 . , [ sec : beam ] and [ sec : kick ] , @xmath30 is defined in a right - handed coordinate system , increasing in the clockwise direction from east ( looking toward the source ) following @xcite ( hereafter dt92 ) and @xcite .",
    "this is opposite to the iau convention in which pa increases in the counterclockwise direction from north toward east looking toward the source .",
    "the polarization conventions are discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : obs ] . ] from equation  [ eq : rvm ] , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the maximum value of @xmath29 at @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the increase in pa gradient observed by @xcite for psr j1141@xmath06545 was interpreted as a decrease in @xmath42 , implying that our line of sight was moving closer to the beam axis .",
    "this and the changing pulse width were interpreted in terms of relativistic precession of the pulsar spin axis with a spin - orbit misalignment angle greater than @xmath43 and probably less than @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper we report on observations of psr j1141@xmath06545 made over 9.3 years from 1999 august to 2008 november with the parkes radio telescope at frequencies close to 1.4 ghz .",
    "since 2004 april , we have observed with systems recording full polarization data but before that , only total intensity data were obtained .",
    "the observations and analysis procedures are described in section  [ sec : obs ] and results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the interpretation of the observed variations in terms of relativistic precession of the pulsar spin axis and the implied shape of the emission beam is described in section  [ sec : beam ] .",
    "the implications of our precessional model for the formation of the system are described in section  [ sec : kick ] . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize results and give our conclusions .",
    "we have observed psr j1141@xmath06545 using the parkes 64-m radio telescope between 1999 august and 2008 november ( mjds 51411 to 54785 ) using ( at different times ) two receiving systems , either the center beam of the parkes 20-cm multibeam ( mb ) receiver @xcite or the `` h - oh '' receiver .",
    "the mb receiver has a bandwidth of about 300 mhz centered at about 1.4 ghz and a system equivalent flux density ( @xmath45 ) of approximately 29 jy .",
    "the h - oh receiver has a wider bandwidth , approximately 600 mhz from 1.2 to 1.8 ghz , but a somewhat higher @xmath45 of about 35 jy .",
    "both receivers have orthogonal linearly - polarized feeds and a linearly - polarized , broad - band and pulsed calibration signal which can be injected into the feed at @xmath46 to the two signal probes .",
    "four different backend systems were used , all of which recorded data across a total bandwidth of 256 mhz : an analogue filterbank ( afb ) having 512 frequency channels on each polarization and recording total - intensity data using a one - bit digitiser system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a wideband correlator ( wbc ) which recorded all four stokes parameters with 1024 frequency channels , and two digital filterbank systems ( pdfb1 and pdfb3 ) which also recorded full polarization data with 512 channels across the band .",
    "for the wbc and the pdfbs , each observation was preceded by a short ( 2-min ) observation of the pulsed calibration signal .",
    "observations of hydra a , assumed to have a flux density of 43.1 jy at 1.4 ghz , were used to set the flux - density scale .",
    "off - line processing made use of the psrchive pulsar data analysis system @xcite .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table  [ tb : obs ] .",
    "afb observations , which commenced soon after the discovery of the pulsar , were recorded on tape and processed off - line to form mean total intensity profiles .",
    "frequency channels containing known interference were given zero weight before data were summed across the band .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , observations made over intervals ranging from a few hours to a few weeks have been grouped as shown in table  [ tb : obs ] .",
    "pulse widths and flux densities were determined for each observation and mean values and their uncertainties for the group determined from these .",
    "the flux - density scale for the afb data was established by comparison with contemporaneous wbc observations .",
    "wbc and pdfb observations were typically of 1-h duration and were folded on - line to form 1-min sub - integrations .",
    "frequency channels containing strong interference , affected by resonances in the feed or with low system gain ( normally 5% of the band at the band edges ) and sub - integrations affected by strong impulsive interference were given zero weight .",
    "using the pulsed calibration signal as a reference , the variations in instrumental gain and phase across the band were removed , stokes parameters formed and the data placed on a flux - density scale .",
    "data were summed to form 15-min sub - integrations and mean profile widths and flux densities computed as for the afb data .",
    "all profiles were recorded with 1024 bins across the pulse period .    observed pas given in this paper follow the astronomical convention , with pa measured from celestial north and increasing toward east ( counter - clockwise looking toward the source ) . the ieee definition of circular polarization is adopted ( i.e. , at a given point in space and looking at the source , the e - vector for a right - circular wave rotates in a counter - clockwise direction ) .",
    "both of these definitions are in accord with iau recommendations ( trans .",
    "iau , 15b , 166 , 1973 ) .",
    "stokes @xmath47 is defined in the sense left - circular minus right - circular to conform with established pulsar polarization conventions which pre - date the iau recommendations .",
    "file header parameters defined the polarization setup for each receiver / back - end combination and these were used by psrchive to correct the stokes parameters so that they conformed to these definitions . for further details on polarization conventions and their implementation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the strong millisecond pulsar , psr j0437@xmath04715 , was observed almost every session and used to check the sign of the calibrated stokes parameters and the absolute value of position angle by comparison with the results given by @xcite which are known to be in accordance with these definitions .",
    "the linearly polarized intensity @xmath48 is a positive definite quantity which is biased by noise .",
    "plotted values have been corrected for this bias using the relations given by @xcite .    before summing in frequency",
    ", the observed pulse profiles must be corrected for faraday rotation across the band .",
    "the nominal rotation measure ( rm ) for psr j1141@xmath06545 is @xmath49 rad m@xmath50 @xcite .",
    "rms were measured for each epoch having polarization data by summing the upper and lower halves of the bandpass separately using the nominal rm , taking a weighted mean of the pa differences between the upper and lower bands across the profile , recomputing the rm and then iterating until convergence .",
    "we show below that the observed pa variations across the pulse profile are complex , both in time and in frequency , with quite different behavior in the central and outer parts of the profile .",
    "consequently , rms were determined separately for the central and outer parts ; we believe that the outer parts represent the true interstellar rm .",
    "the mb receiver suffers from significant coupling between the nominally orthogonal feed probes .",
    "observed polarization variations resulting from this coupling are a function of parallactic angle and the coupling parameters can be measured by analysis of a series of observations of a polarized source covering a wide range of parallactic angles @xcite .",
    "psr j0437@xmath04715 was observed every few months , typically for 10 minutes each hour during a 10-hour transit , for each of the wbc and pdfb configurations used with the mb receiver ( table  [ tb : obs ] ) .",
    "these data were analysed using the psrchive program pcm to determine the feed ellipticities and their relative orientation as a function of frequency across the band .",
    "observations of psr j1141@xmath06545 were then calibrated to remove the effects of the cross - coupling .",
    "cross - coupling in the h -",
    "oh receiver is an order of magnitude less and this calibration step was not required .",
    "figure  [ fg:0437 ] shows ( truncated ) pdfb1 polarization profiles for psr j0437@xmath04715 taken with the mb and h - oh receivers using the observational and processing methods described above .",
    "the results are essentially identical within the noise uncertainties , confirming that our calibration procedures are robust.4715 is only + 1.5 rad m@xmath50 @xcite and so the pa difference expected between 1369 mhz and 1433 mhz is only about @xmath51 , not visible in figure  [ fg:0437 ] . ]",
    "while not the primary objective of this work , it was necessary to monitor period variations of the pulsar in order make accurate predictions of the topocentric period for use during the observations and to sum observations in off - line processing .",
    "initially , the timing model of @xcite was used for this purpose . however",
    ", while processing the 2007 july 18 observations , it was realised that the pulsar had suffered a sizable glitch .",
    "glitch parameters resulting from a fit of a model including post - glitch exponential decay ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to pulse time - of - arrival ( toa ) data from 2006 april to 2008 november are given in table  [ tb : glt ] .",
    "toas were obtained from average pulse profiles for data segments of 15-min duration and the program tempo2 @xcite was used to determine the timing parameters .",
    "there was only a small relaxation of the pulse frequency toward the extrapolated pre - glitch solution following the glitch , i.e. , the @xmath52 parameter was small .",
    "significant timing noise remains after the fit and the uncertainties have been multiplied by five ( @xmath53 ) to allow for this .",
    "table  [ tb : psrpar ] gives pulsar timing parameters from a fit to post - glitch data from 2007 december to 2008 november ; the @xmath54  d following the glitch were omitted to avoid biasing the result by the post - glitch relaxation . over the fitted data span there is significant timing noise and the fit uncertainties have been multiplied by a factor of three .",
    "only the pulse frequency @xmath55 and @xmath56 were fitted for ; the position and the binary parameters were held fixed at the values given by @xcite .",
    "parameters are quoted in tdb - compatible units , and the `` dd '' binary model @xcite and the jet propulsion laboratory solar - system ephemeris de405 @xcite were used .    figure  [ fg : w50s14 ] shows the observed time variations of the 50% mean pulse width ( @xmath57 ) and mean flux density at 1400 mhz over the 9.3-year data span .",
    "such dramatic long - term variations in pulse width ( more than a factor of three ) are unprecedented .",
    "the most straight - foward explanation is that they result from precession of the pulsar spin axis changing our view of the pulsar beam .",
    "the variations are complex with a @xmath58-d interval around mjd 52800 ( 2003 june ) where the width clearly decreases with time before increasing again .",
    "recent data show that a maximum width was reached around mjd 54150 ( 2007 february ) and now the width is decreasing .",
    "there is good agreement between the widths obtained with the different back - end systems , although the afb widths tend to be a few percent less than those measured with the wbc or pdfb1 at the same or similar time owing to differences in the instrumental impulse response .",
    "the time variation in @xmath28 is similar , but with a smaller relative change over the data span .",
    "the mean pulsed flux density has also changed dramatically over the data span with a broad peak around mjd 52500 ( mid-2002 ) .",
    "there is a significant day - to - day variation in the measured flux densities .",
    "this is indicated by the large error bars on the afb averages ( which typically cover a week or more ) and by the scatter in the wbc / pdfb measurements ( which typically are made on a single day ) , both much larger than the uncertainty in an individual measurement .",
    "these short - term variations can be attributed to refractive scintillation for which the expected timescale is about seven days @xcite .",
    "however , the broad rise and decay of the flux density over the nine - year data span is unlikely to be a scintillation effect and we attribute this to the changing aspect of a complex beam pattern sweeping across the earth as the pulsar spin axis precesses .",
    "average total - intensity profiles as a function of time are shown in figure  [ fg : prf ] illustrating the profile evolution at early times the profile was dominated by a strong trailing peak with a broad ramp of emission leading up to it , whereas at late times , the profile is more symmetric with an approximately gaussian shape .",
    "figure  [ fg : grey ] shows the profile evolution in the form of greyscale plots with both linear ( left ) and logarithmic ( right ) intensity scales .",
    "the logarithmic plot clearly illustrates a striking property of the profile evolution , that the width at a very low level ( the lowest contour is at 1% of the peak ) is remarkably constant , suggesting that the low - level flux - density contours represent the overall beam extent . as will be further described in section  [ sec : model ] , the outer parts of the profile are relatively stable , both in shape and flux density .",
    "the profiles in figures  [ fg : prf ] and [ fg : grey ] have therefore been aligned using the midpoint at a constant flux density of 2% of the maximum as a reference point .",
    "this is an important assumption as it affects not only the interpretation of the various profile components , but also the parameters derived from any timing analysis . with this assumption",
    ", the peak of the profile has moved in a somewhat step - wise fashion from near its trailing edge to near its center .",
    "this evolution will be interpreted in terms of the growth and decay of components representing bright regions of the beam in section  [ sec : model ] below .    figure  [ fg : poln ] shows the mean pulse polarization profiles for psr j1141@xmath06545 at two epochs separated by about three years .",
    "plotted pas refer to the band - center frequency as marked on the plots.6545 given by @xcite have the opposite sign of @xmath47 and the opposite sense of position - angle swing to the iau and pulsar conventions used for observational results in this paper .",
    "we also note that the same comments apply to the polarization profiles for the double pulsar , psr j0737@xmath03039a / b , presented by @xcite and @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the rotation measures given in these latter papers have the wrong sign .",
    "the current best estimate of the rm for psr j0737@xmath03039a / b with the corrected sign is @xmath59  rad  m@xmath50 @xcite .",
    "] dramatic changes are observed over the three - year span in the ( total intensity ) pulse profile and in the polarization parameters . once the sign differences are allowed for and ignoring the absolute value of pa ,",
    "the 2004 profile in figure  [ fg : poln ] agrees well with the profile given by @xcite taken about two months earlier . in particular , the pa changes rapidly near the profile center , indicating that our line of sight traverses the beam relatively close to the magnetic axis .",
    "however there are clear and signficant departures from the pa variation expected for the simple rvm .",
    "the evolution of the profiles of linearly polarized intensity @xmath60 and of stokes @xmath47 across the pulse over the 4.5-year span of the polarization data are shown in figure  [ fg : lvpol ] .",
    "both show systematic changes as a function of time . in the case of the @xmath60 profiles , components at different pulse phases",
    "appear to get stronger or weaker as a function of time , whereas the variation of stokes @xmath47 is more consistent across the whole profile .",
    "it is striking that the variation of @xmath47 across the pulse changes smoothly from a positive to negative sign change at early epochs to a negative to positive change at late epochs . especially at later times",
    ", there are clear dips in the linearly polarized intensity at pulse phases near @xmath61 .",
    "as will be discussed further below , these are attributed to overlapping of approximately orthogonally polarized components .",
    "figure  [ fg : pa ] shows the evolution of the pa variation across the pulse .",
    "the observed pa variations are clearly not well described by the rvm and there are clear systematic trends in the pa variations as a function of time .",
    "while there are some differences between adjacent pa profiles which may in part result from residual calibration errors or low - level radio - frequency interference , in general the trends in polarization properties with time are smooth and consistent despite the use of different receivers and backend systems at different times , again showing that our calibration procedures are effective .",
    "most striking is the clear difference in pa evolution between the central and the outer parts of the profile .",
    "figure  [ fg : pa_evol ] shows the pa variations over the 4.5-year data span averaged over the inner part ( phase @xmath62 to 0.0068 ) and the outer parts ( @xmath63 to @xmath64 and 0.0136 to 0.0253 ) of the profile",
    ". variations of the mean pa for the inner part of the pulse profile are very significant with an intial decrease followed by a rapid increase which slows at later epochs . for the outer parts of the profile ,",
    "the mean pa at early times shows some fluctuations but overall is consistent with a slow decrease , flattening at later times . especially at early times ,",
    "the polarization in the outer parts of the profile is quite weak and hence the fluctuations in pa can be attributed to remaining systematic errors and/or contributions from the wings of the stronger emission in the center of the profile .",
    "these pa changes could be due to variations in rm or to aspect changes resulting from the precessional motion . in figure",
    "[ fg : rm ] we show the rms separately for the central and outer parts of the profile computed using the iterative method described in section  [ sec : obs ] . for the outer parts of the profile there is no significant time variation .",
    "the weighted mean rm value is @xmath65 rad m@xmath50 with a reduced @xmath66 of 3.1 ; the quoted uncertainty is the weighted rms deviation multiplied by @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast , for the central part , there is a clear systematic variation of measured rm with time .",
    "we believe that this is not a true variation in the interstellar rm  it would be much larger than rm variations in other pulsars that are attributed to a changing path through the interstellar medium , e.g. , for the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is inconsistent with the changes in the central pa shown in figure  [ fg : pa_evol ] .",
    "rather , we believe the observed changes in both pa and apparent rm for the central part of the psr j1141@xmath06545 profile are due to variations in the relative amplitudes of observed profile components with different pas and spectral indices resulting from the changing aspect of the line of sight relative to the beam axis as the pulsar spin axis precesses . this is somewhat analogous to the apparent rm variations ( as a function of pulse phase ) seen in psr b2016 + 28 by @xcite which are attributed to over - lapping non - orthogonal components .",
    "we adopt pas in the outer zones as representing the underlying magnetic field structure .",
    "consequently , these pa variations should be consistent with the rvm .",
    "the two sides are consistently at approximately the same pa , as expected in the rvm .",
    "also , in some cases , e.g. , the 2007 august 4 profile shown in figure  [ fg : poln ] , there is evidence for the pa variations expected for the rvm at the inner edges of the outer pas .",
    "since there is no signficant rm variation for these parts , we interpret the observed slow decrease in outer - zone pas shown in the right panel of figure  [ fg : pa_evol ] as intrinsic and resulting from precession of the pulsar spin axis .",
    "by modelling the observed pa variations in terms of precessional motion of the pulsar s spin axis , we can infer additial properties of the system , for example , the spin - orbit misalignment angle and the precessional phase . as a first step in the modelling , we fit the observed total - intensity profiles ( figure  [ fg : prf ] ) with gaussian components .",
    "a total of six components are fitted , although for later epochs only four are required .",
    "we have used fixed central phases for the components ; only the amplitude and width of each component is allowed to vary as a function of epoch .",
    "the component phases , given in table  [ tb : comp_phs ] , were chosen using an iterative process by fitting the first and last observed profiles .",
    "fitted components and their sum are shown in figure  [ fg : prof ] for a selected set of profiles which cover most of the observed data span , showing that an excellent fit to the observed profiles is obtained .",
    "this retroactively justifies our decision to fix the component phases .",
    "figure  [ fg : comps ] gives the widths and mean flux densities of the fitted components .",
    "the mean flux densities are scaled so that their sum equals the smoothed flux - density variation shown in figure  [ fg : w50s14 ] . for components 3 and 5",
    ", the fitted amplitudes dropped to zero after mjds 52100 and 52500 , respectively .",
    "it is striking that the amplitude of each component varies smoothly from one epoch to the next and that the widths of the components are relatively stable .",
    "this suggests that these components represent real physical zones of emission which are fixed in longitude on the star .",
    "we note that most of the observed flux density variation comes from the central and trailing components .",
    "although the leading component 1 is relatively weak at early epochs and dominates the profile at late epochs , its absolute amplitude remains approximately constant across the whole data span .",
    "as discussed above , the observed polarization pa and @xmath60 variations ( figs  [ fg : pa ] and [ fg : lvpol ] ) strongly suggest that these components may be grouped into two overlapping and quasi - independent emission zones , one dominant in the wings of the observed pulse and the other dominant in the central regions .",
    "we note that similar non - rvm variations ( not accountable for by overlapping orthogonal polarization modes ) are seen in other short - period pulsars , for example , psr b1913 + 16 @xcite and psr b1534 + 12 @xcite .",
    "the outer components ( 1 and 6 ) may be identified with the outer zones in the pa and @xmath60 plots . as discussed above ,",
    "the pas in these zones together are well fitted by a single rvm .",
    "note that , as discussed in sections  [ sec : intro ] and [ sec : obs ] , for modelling purposes , we have adopted a right - hand coordinate system in which the sign of pa is reversed compared to the astronomical convention used in section  [ sec : results ] . we also choose @xmath68 and hold this fixed for all epochs .",
    "most previous discussions of relativistic spin precession in this and other pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have concentrated on measurement and interpretation of the rate of change of impact parameter . for psr j1141@xmath06545 ,",
    "the impact parameter is not very well determined because of the presence of the evidently independent emission in the central part of the profile . however , since we have measured absolute position angles , we have another , potentially more sensitive , observable : the central pa of the rvm , @xmath34 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the rvm",

    "the solution with @xmath97 corresponds to @xmath98 while the other solution implies @xmath99 .",
    "we can use the information provided by the pa swing to identify the appropriate solution in the following way . from the pa swing ( in the dt92 convention ) , the slope is negative and hence @xmath93 .",
    "also , the fact that the pa becomes flat at the outer wings suggests an outer line of sight ( that is , the line of sight is on the equatorial side of the magnetic axis when @xmath100 , see , e.g. , lorimer & kramer 2005 ) rather than an inner one .",
    "the combination of both is only possible in a solution with @xmath101 , corresponding to solution where @xmath102 .",

    "the best solution from this fitting procedure corresponds to @xmath73 being very close to zero .",

    "therefore , from equation  ( [ eq : lambda3 ] ) , we have that @xmath105 .",
    "however , the total - intensity profiles and pa swing show that the magnetic axis can not be exactly aligned ( or counter - aligned ) with the rotation axis .",
    "the fact that the sign of the central pa swing remains the same at all epochs also shows that @xmath38 does not change sign as a result of the precessional motion .",
    "this suggests that the fit to the pa data as a whole will lie somewhat to the right of the best - fit point shown in figure  [ fg : chi2pa0 ] .",

    "figure  [ fg : delta_pdf ] shows the joint probability density function for the spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath76 derived from the fits to the pa variations and the global rvm fit ( figure  [ fg : chi2final ] ) .",
    "given the geometry of the system we can obtain the model time variation of impact parameter @xmath38 using equations [ eq : lambda1 ]  [ eq : phi ] and [ eq : lambda3 ] . the result , given in figure  [ fg : beta ] , shows that the observer s line of sight has approached the magnetic axis direction through most of our observed data span , reaching its closest approach around mjd 54000 , and is now receding again .",
    "this reversal in the variation of @xmath38 is supported by the fact that the pulse width reached a maximum at about mjd 54200 and is now decreasing ( figure  [ fg : w50s14 ] ) .",
    "note that we have obtained these results by fitting only the polarization data , i.e. , we did not make use of the total intensity information . although the over - all variation of pulse width is consistent with the precessional model , the detailed variations are more complex .",
    "this shows that the assumption of a uniform circular beam is not appropriate .",
    "given the variation of @xmath38 over the data span ( figure  [ fg : beta ] ) and the time variation of component shapes and amplitudes ( figure  [ fg : comps ] ) , we can compute the two - dimensional intensity profile of the emission beam over the traversed region . for each epoch",
    "we compute the traverse of our line of sight across the polar region and accumulate the pulse intensity in a two dimensional grid centered on the magnetic axis .",
    "the resulting beam pattern is shown in figure  [ fg : beam ] . because of the reversal in the time - derivative of @xmath38 when it was close to zero , we only see one half of the polar - cap region . despite this we can clearly see that the beam is quite asymmetric with no evidence for a core - cone or ring structure that is symmetric about the magnetic pole .",
    "the partially filled beam can be described as `` patchy '' , albeit with just one major patch in the region scanned so far .",
    "although this is the first two - dimensional map of an emission beam to clearly show such patchy structure , there is good evidence that the emission beam from most pulsars is best described in this way @xcite .",
    "although the observed pulse width is about average ( the median pulse width for all pulsars is about @xmath107 ) , the small value of @xmath108 implies that the intrinsic beamwidth is small .",
    "figure  [ fg : beam ] shows that the emitting region fits within a circle of radius about @xmath6 centered on the magnetic axis .",
    "excluding millisecond pulsars , observed pulse widths are generally consistent with the relation @xmath109 @xcite . for psr j1141@xmath06545",
    "the predicted value of @xmath110 is about @xmath111 , much larger than the emitting zone traversed so far .",
    "psr j1141@xmath06545 was not detected in the parkes 70 cm survey @xcite although , even at the present relatively low flux - density levels , a detection with signal / noise ratio of the order of 50 would have been expected .",
    "observations within half a beamwidth of the pulsar position were made 1993 july 14 ( mjd 49182 ) .",
    "figure  [ fg : beta ] shows that the impact parameter @xmath38 at that time was about @xmath112 .",
    "this non - detection therefore suggests that the beam half - width in latitude is @xmath113 , although this must be qualified because of the patchy beam structure .",
    "there are good arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that beams in young pulsars are elongated in the latitude direction and hence more fan - like than circular .",
    "an elongated beam has also been suggested for psr b1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "observations over the next decade or two will establish whether or not this is the case for psr j1141@xmath06545 as @xmath38 returns to large ( negative ) values .",
    "there is good and increasing evidence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the velocity and spin vectors of young pulsars are nearly aligned .",
    "this suggests that the kick from the supernova ( sn ) explosion , the dominant factor in determining the pulsar space motion , may also determine the spin direction ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "since psr  j1141@xmath06545 is a young pulsar , its spin direction is therefore likely to be aligned with the sn kick .",
    "while precession will have caused the azimuthal angle of the pulsar spin relative to the ( post - sn ) orbital angular momentum to wrap many times over the lifetime of the pulsar , the polar angle ( @xmath76 in this paper ) should still reflect the direction between the kick and the post - sn orbit normal .",
    "we have explored if this expectation can set any interesting constraints on the kick imparted to the forming neutron star , using the binary orbit and kick description in @xcite and @xcite . in terms of their variables",

    "* ) , which may or may not have a solution that falls within acceptable ranges for the pre - sn mass and the size of the ( assumed circular ) pre - sn orbit . as this is a young system , we did not evolve the system s motion back in time through the galaxy to identify plausible birth sites @xcite , nor did we evolve the orbital size and eccentricity to account for gravitational radiation losses @xcite , but simply assumed the current velocity and orbital parameters reflect the birth properties . note that the results are therefore independent of the assumed distance ; we assumed a distance of 3.7  kpc @xcite .",
    "we put uniform priors on @xmath115 ( sampling from @xmath7 to @xmath5 and testing both positive and negative values in each trial ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath7 to @xmath118 ) .",
    "we sampled the companion mass over ( @xmath119 )  m@xmath120 and the total system mass over ( @xmath121 )  m@xmath120 , based on the orbital parameters reported in @xcite .",
    "we subtracted these to get the pulsar mass for the given trial , and used the mass function computed from the orbit presented in @xcite , 0.176550265  m@xmath120 , to derive @xmath122 .",
    "we considered only the cases where @xmath123 in order to match the modeling in the previous section .",
    "while there is a scintillation velocity measurement for this system @xcite which could in principle provide some constraints on the angle between the proper motion and @xmath116 , similar measurements have been shown to be quite unreliable in the double pulsar , probably because of the effects of anisotropies in the interstellar medium @xcite and hence we do not make use of this information here .",
    "instead we investigate maxwellian velocity distributions with 1-dimensional dispersions of 50 km  s@xmath9 and 100 km  s@xmath9 ( these dispersions are of order the transverse velocity derived from the scintillation measurements ) , combined with a second maxwellian with 1-dimensional dispersion of 12 km  s@xmath9 representing the pre - sn peculiar velocity .",
    "we then derive bayesian probability distributions for the pre - sn and kick parameters as described in @xcite , considering pre - sn masses in the range 1.4  10.0  m@xmath120 to allow for the binding energy of the neutron star @xcite . for each acceptable solution of the quadratic equation , the relevant set of parameters",
    "is assigned a uniform likelihood ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a `` natural '' weighting .",
    "we then make use of the probability distribution for the post - sn pulsar spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath76 obtained from the pa fitting ( figure  [ fg : delta_pdf ] ) to give a constrained weighting on the range of acceptable pre - sn parameters and kick velocity .",
    "the derived probability density functions for the pre - sn stellar mass , the kick velocity and the spin - orbit misalignment angle after constraining with the allowed misalignment - angle distribution ( figure  [ fg : delta_pdf ] ) are shown in figure  [ fg : pdfc ] .",
    "table  [ tb : pdf ] gives the median values of the parameters and the limits at 68% and 95% confidence .",
    "we note that the natural weighting tends to disfavour spin - orbit misalignment angles around @xmath124 , so the constrained distribution is biased toward slightly larger angles compared to figure  [ fg : delta_pdf ] .",
    "not unexpectedly , the assumed distribution of post - sn system velocities has a significant effect on the likely kick velocity , with larger values requiring a larger kick .",
    "however , the most probable kick velocity is relatively small in both cases , about 100 km s@xmath9 for a dispersion of 50 km s@xmath9 and about 180 km s@xmath9 for a dispersion of 100 km s@xmath9 .",
    "median velocities ( table  [ tb : pdf ] ) are somewhat higher since the distributions have a high - velocity tail .",
    "never - the - less , they are still small compared with mean or median of the inferred three - dimensional pulsar velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "relatively low progenitor masses are strongly favoured with median values of about 2 m@xmath8 .",
    "the pulsar mass implied by the timing fits for companion mass and total mass @xcite is just 1.27  m@xmath8 , lower than average @xcite , but very similar to the mass of psr j0737@xmath03039b , the second - born and slow pulsar in the double pulsar system .",
    "this system also has a relatively low implied kick velocity from the b pulsar formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but see also @xcite . these low masses and kick velocities may imply formation of the neutron star in an electron - capture collapse of the core of an onemg white dwarf @xcite but other evolutionary histories are also possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the inferred spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath76 in the psr j1141@xmath06545 system is large , with a most probable value of between @xmath125 and @xmath4 .",
    "that @xmath76 is not small ( in contrast to pulsar a of the double pulsar system , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is consistent with the major changes that we see in the pulse profile as a result of the precession and in fact results from the fitting of the precessional model to these changes .",
    "the dramatic long - term changes in pulse shape and amplitude observed for psr j1141@xmath06545 ( figures  [ fg : w50s14 ] and [ fg : prf ] ) are unprecedented in pulsar astronomy .",
    "pulse profile changes are observed in mode - changing pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in radio emission from magnetars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but these are of a quite different character to the variations seen in psr j1141@xmath06545 and are certainly caused by fluctuations in the emitted pulsar beam .",
    "slow and systematic variations similar to those observed in psr j1141@xmath06545 are seen in the pulse profiles of psr b1913 + 16 and psr b1534 + 12 , but these are of much smaller amplitude .",
    "all three of these pulsars are in close binary orbits with massive companions .",
    "consequently , the observed profile variations most probably result from precession of the pulsar spin axis resulting from spin - orbit coupling changing our view of the pulsar beam .",
    "precession of the pulsar s spin axis has resulted in large and systematic changes in both the amplitude and the shape of the observed pulse profile as our line of sight scanned across the polar region .",
    "there are clearly large variations in emissivity across the nominal beam area , consistent with the idea of a partially filled or patchy beam .",
    "the large variations in the observed mean pulse profile raise the issue of profile alignment when comparing different epochs .",
    "figure  [ fg : grey ] shows that the pulse width is relatively stable at the lowest contour levels .",
    "we have chosen to align the profiles according to the mid - point of a constant flux - density level near their extreme wings .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the outer components are relatively stable , both in flux density and shape ( figure  [ fg : comps ] ) . with this choice , alignment of",
    "the polarization features over the data span is also very stable , giving added support to our method of defining the absolute pulse phase relative to the star .",
    "we note that this choice also defines a reference phase for pulse timing .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for psr b1913 + 16 also , the pulse width defined by the lower beam contours is more constant than , say , the pulse width at the 50% level @xcite .",
    "major changes are also observed in the pulse polarization parameters over the 4.5 years in which the polarization has been monitored .",
    "there has been a steady evolution of the circular polarization with the sign of the sense reversal near the profile center changing from positive - to - negative to negative - to - positive over the data span .",
    "variations in the linear polarization are complex with quite different behavior in the central and outer zones of the pulse profile ( figure  [ fg : pa ] ) .",
    "our choice of taking the outer - zone pas to represent the underlying magnetic - field structure is supported by a number of factors .",
    "first , the outer - zone pas are well fitted by the rotating vector model ( rvm ) whereas this is less true of the central - zone pas .",
    "more importantly , there is a large and variable offset between the central pas and the outer - zone pas .",
    "the time variation of the mean central - zone pa is rapid and inconsistent with precessional motion .",
    "furthermore there is an apparent time variation of rm for the central zone which is not present for the outer zones .",
    "we attribute the complex behavior of the central - zone polarization to the overlapping of independent components which have different pas and different spectral indices",
    ". it may be possible to model the polarization variations based on the variations of the total - intensity components shown in figure  [ fg : comps ] but this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we note that similar but much less dramatic non - rvm variations are observed in the central parts of the profiles for psr b1913 + 16 and psr b1534 + 12 .",
    "fitting of a precessional model to the observed pa variations leads to the conclusion that the spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath76 is very large in this system , with the pulsar spin axis nearly orthogonal to the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "this is consistent with the large profile shape and polarization changes as the spin axis precesses .",
    "unfortunately , because of the complex and poorly understood emission physics , it is not possible to turn the argument around and use these observations as a test of the precessional predictions of general relativity .",
    "it is interesting to note though that a large spin - orbit misalignment angle is quite possible despite the low progenitor mass and modest kick velocity .",
    "this result is not in conflict with the conclusion of @xcite , that the spin - orbit misalignment angle is probably less than @xmath44 , since that was on the proviso that the pulsar was not at a precessional phase when the angle between the observer s line of sight and the spin axis ( @xmath73 in our terminology ) was changing rapidly . in our solution",
    ", @xmath73 is close to zero and is changing rapidly .",
    "our observational data span encompassed the time when the precessional longitude passed through @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the impact parameter @xmath38 reached an extremum during our data span .",
    "in fact , @xmath42 reached a minimum value very close to zero at about mjd 54000 ( figure  [ fg : beta ] ) .",
    "this solution is consistent with the observed maximum in the pulse width at around the same time and implies that we will only ever traverse one side of the emission beam .",
    "the slope of the @xmath38 time - variation has now reversed and so we are now retracing our earlier path across the beam .",
    "we therefore predict that over the coming decade we will see a time - reversed `` replay '' of the recent profile amplitude and shape evolution .",

    "<S> observations of the binary pulsar psr j1141@xmath06545 using the parkes radio telescope over 9.3 years show clear time - variations in pulse width , shape and polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precession of the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system changing our view of the emission beam . over the nine years </S>",
    "<S> , the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more than a factor of three , reaching a maximum value of nearly @xmath1 in early 2007 . </S>",
    "<S> large variations have also been observed in the 1400-mhz mean flux density ; this reached a peak of @xmath2  mjy in mid-2002 but over the past several years has been relatively steady at @xmath3  mjy . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 april using digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variations in both linear and circular polarization . </S>",
    "<S> position angle variations , both across the pulse profile and over the data span , are complex , with major differences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the outer parts as representing the underlying magnetic field and fit the rotating - vector model to these regions . </S>",
    "<S> modelling of the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of the pulsar spin axis shows that the spin - orbit misalignment angle is about @xmath4 and that the precessional phase has passed through @xmath5 during the course of our observations . at the start of our observations , </S>",
    "<S> the line - of - sight impact parameter was about @xmath6 in magnitude and it reached a minimum very close to @xmath7 around early 2007 , consistent with the observed pulse width variations . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore mapped approximately one half of the emission beam , at least out to a radius of about @xmath6 , showing that it is very asymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis . </S>",
    "<S> the derived precessional parameters imply that the pre - supernova star had a mass of about 2  m@xmath8 and that the supernova recoil kick velocity was relatively small , between 100 and 250  km  s@xmath9 , depending on the assumed systemic velocity . with the reversal in the rate of change of the impact parameter , we predict that over the next decade we will see a reversed `` replay '' of the variations observed in the past decade . </S>"
