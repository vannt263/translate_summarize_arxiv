    "fields of the order of 0.1  t produce cool features in the photosphere , called sunspots , while fields of the order of 0.01  t are associated with a heating of the atmosphere leading to bright photospheric facular patches and chromospheric plages .",
    "transient releases of magnetic energy on timescales from a few minutes to hours manifest themselves as solar flares . while the formation and evolution of individual active regions are largely unpredictable , their global behaviour reveals a remarkable regularity .",
    "the total area of the sunspots varies in a cyclic manner with a period of @xmath0  yr . at the beginning of each cycle , sunspots appear at latitudes of @xmath1 in two localized belts , one in each hemisphere , that migrate toward the equator , reaching a latitude of @xmath2 at the maximum of the total sunspot area and of @xmath3 at the next minimum , when a new couple of active belts appears at high latitudes marking the beginning of a new cycle .",
    "in addition to the strong magnetic fields localized inside ars , the sun displays a global dipolar magnetic field with an intensity of @xmath4  t , symmetric around the solar rotation axis , which cyclically reverses its polarities close to the maximum of sunspot activity .",

    "* rieger  ( 1984 ) ) and are therefore called _ rieger cycles_. + a theoretical framework to interpret the solar cycle is offered by dynamo models based on mean - field magnetohydrodynamics ( see ( * ? ? ? * charbonneau 2005 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* weiss & thompson 2009 ) ; and references therein ) .",
    "the global solar dipole field is stretched by the differential rotation giving rise to an intense field in the azimuthal direction which emerges under the action of magnetic buoyancy and leads to the formation of sunspots in the photosphere and magnetic loops in the outer atmosphere .",
    "however , the poloidal and azimuthal fields are subject to a turbulent diffusion , hence the poloidal field will decay , leading eventually to the decay of the azimuthal field , unless some mechanism can regenerate the poloidal field itself .",
    "such a mechanism is much more subtle than differential rotation and is thought to be associated to the action of the coriolis force on turbulent convection which imparts a non - vanishing mean helicity to the turbulent velocity field of the plasma .",
    "since the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma , such a mean helicity is capable to regenerate a poloidal field from an azimuthal field , thus allowing a dynamo to operate ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* weiss & thompson 2009 ) , and references therein , for details ) .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath10 effect .",
    "+ the role of the different effects mentioned above is summarized in the definition of the non - dimensional _",
    "dynamo number_. indicating with @xmath11 the typical amplitude of the differential rotation as specified by the radial gradient of the angular velocity ( see below ) , and by @xmath12 and @xmath13 the typical amplitudes of the @xmath10 effect and the turbulent diffusivity , respectively , we define the dynamo number as : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the radius of the star . in order for the induction effects represented by the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath16 to overcome the turbulent diffusivity @xmath13 , the dynamo number must be greater than some critical value @xmath17 , which depends on the boundary conditions , the geometry of the dynamo shell and the spatial distribution of the induction effects . in other words , only when @xmath18 the dynamo can work and we observe a large - scale magnetic field , otherwise any large - scale field is simply diffused away on a time scale @xmath19 . when the magnetic field is amplified enough ,",
    "it starts to react back on the small scale turbulent motions and the large scale velocity fields .",
    "such a feedback tends to reduce both the @xmath10 effect ( @xmath10 quenching ) and the differential rotation , thus opposing any further amplification of the field .",
    "when a feedback is included , a dynamo model is said to be magnetohydrodynamic or non - linear , in constrast to the simpler linear ( or kinematic ) models that neglect it and assume a fixed @xmath10 effect and differential rotation .",
    "+ kinematic dynamo models were proposed long ago for the sun and account for the oscillation of the sunspot area and the cyclic reversal of the global poloidal field .",
    "they predict that the migration of the azimuthal field as the cycle progresses is in the equatorward direction if the product @xmath20 is negative in the northern hemisphere , while it is in the poleward direction if that quantity is positive . at the base of the solar convection zone ,",
    "helioseismic measurements tell us that @xmath21 at latitudes lower than about @xmath22 , while @xmath23 at higher latitudes ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thompson  2003 ) ) .",
    "this accounts for the observed direction of migration of the activity belts , if a negative @xmath10 is assumed close to the base of the solar convection zone in the northern hemisphere ( see , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schlinchenmaier & stix 1995 ) ) .",
    "the scenario is consistent with a localization of the dynamo in the overshoot layer immediately below the solar convection zone , where a strong shear , mainly in the radial direction , has been detected by helioseismology ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thompson  2003 ) ) .",
    "another property of such a layer is its subadiabatic stratification that keeps the magnetic field stable until it reaches a critical intensity of @xmath24  t , beyond which it emerges toward the photosphere ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* caligari  1995 ) ) . nevertheless , the possibility of a dynamo action distributed throughout the convection zone or even localized in the subphotospheric shear layer where @xmath23 , is not ruled out .",
    "it is possible that the activity observed at the surface of the sun results from the contributions of different kinds of dynamos which differ for their location , the storage mechanism of their azimuthal field and the relative amplitude of the field fluctuations with respect to the mean field ( cf .",
    "* durney  1993 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brandenburg 2005 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * kosovichev 2009 ) ) .",
    "finally , it is important to mention the role of the meridional circulation that may act as a sort of conveyor belt transporting the magnetic field between regions where different induction processes take place , e.g. , from the overshoot layer , where the shear is mainly localized , into the convection zone , where the @xmath10 effect is possibly dominant .",
    "therefore , the meridional circulation affects the basic properties of dynamo models including the period of the cycle and the direction and rate of migration of the mean azimuthal field . + a fundamental question concerns",
    "the possibility of understanding a complex and highly non - linear system such as the solar ( or a stellar ) dynamo by means of simple parametric models like mean - field models .",
    "they drastically reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the system which are of the order of @xmath25 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* canuto 2000 ) ) and apply highly simplified parametric dependences to account for non - linear effects .",
    "yet , they seem to be quite successful in explaining the main characteristics of the solar cycle .",
    "the reason for their success and the degree up to which we may hope to extend the comparison between models and observations has been recently discussed by spiegel ( 2009 ) .",
    "stellar discs are not resolved by current observations , therefore , we need suitable proxies for stellar magnetic fields that can be derived from disc - integrated photometric or spectroscopic measurements . in the sun ,",
    "the transits of ars across the disc during its rotation produce characteristic flux variations .",
    "cool spots produce flux decreases while faculae induce an increase of the flux with a remarkable centre - to - limb dependence because their contrast is greater close to the limb .",
    "the total solar irradiance , i.e. , a measure of the solar bolometric flux at the distance of 1 au , is a good proxy of the optical flux modulation induced by ars .",
    "its variations have now been monitored for almost three activity cycles .",
    "owing to the predominant effect of the faculae , the sun at the maximum of activity is brighter by @xmath26 percent than at the minimum ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* frhlich & lean 2004 ) ) . in the case of solar - like stars ,",
    "it has been difficult to measure variations of the order of 0.001 mag from the ground over timescales of decades .",
    "therefore , the use of long - term series of optical photometry to study activity cycles in stars with an activity level comparable to that of the sun is still quite limited .",
    "the situation is different in the case of chromospheric proxies , notably the excess flux in the core of the ca  ii  h&k lines , which varies by @xmath27 percent along the solar cycle ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hall & lockwood 2004 ) ) .",
    "such a variation is measured by means of the so - called @xmath28 index ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vaughan  1978 ) ) , whose systematic monitoring in a sample of @xmath29 late - type main - sequence single stars started @xmath30 years ago .",
    "this is the famous h&k project dedicated to the detection and study of stellar activity cycles .",
    "its main results have been summarized by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* baliunas  ( 1995 , 1998 ) ) .",
    "they find that about 60 percent of main - sequence stars with spectral types from f to early m show cycles .",
    "cycles shorter than @xmath31 yr are never observer among stars with a rotation period longer than @xmath32 days .",
    "several stars show two independent periodicities .",
    "about 25 percent of the sample show a variable @xmath28 index , but without any obvious periodicity .",
    "this behaviour is more frequent among younger and more rapidly rotating stars , while stars with an age comparable to the sun tend to show a cyclic behaviour or an almost constant flux .",
    "the latter have been dubbed _",
    "flat activity stars _ and amount to @xmath33 percent of the sample .",
    "it was suggested that they could be in a phase of extended activity minimum , akin the sun during its grand minima .",
    "however , recent studies have questioned such an interpretation , also because they span a range of chromospheric flux from below the solar minimum to near the higher levels of the present solar cycle ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hall & lockwood 2004 ) ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath28 index is not a good proxy of magnetic activity at low levels of magnetic flux because the core fluxes of the ca  ii  h&k lines are dominated by the basal chromospheric heating due to acoustic waves produced by photospheric convection , irrespective of the magnetic flux .",
    "it is only when the chromospheric flux is significantly higher than the basal level for a given spectral type ( and luminosity class ) that the ca  ii  h&k lines are useful to study magnetic activity and cycles .",
    "such considerations are important also for subgiant and giant stars which show a smaller frequency of cyclic variations ( @xmath34 percent ) and a more variable level of activity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baliunas  1998 ) ) , possibly because their chromospheric flux is dominated by acoustic heating .",
    "+ chromospheric proxies can be used to measure the rotation period of the ars in a star , when they have a sufficiently long lifetime to produce a unambiguous rotational modulation of the flux .",
    "therefore , it is possible to correlate the level of chromospheric activity with the rotation period .",
    "observations of the sun as a star showed a variation of the rotation period in phase with the solar cycle , i.e. , a decrease of the rotation period as the cycle progressed from minimum to maximum and then a further reduction followed by an abrupt increase when the activity went through the next minimum and a new cycle began ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* donahue & keil 1995 ) ) .",
    "this was consistent with a migration of the activity belts from the higher latitudes toward the equator , followed by the appearance of new high latitude belts at the beginning of a new cycle .",
    "nevertheless , the solar - type correlation is not the only one observed among the h&k project stars .",
    "it has been quite surprising to find that several stars show an _ anti - solar _ behaviour , i.e. , the rotation period of their ars increases as the cycle progresses from minimum to maximum activity ( see , e.g. , the case of hd  114710 ; ( * ? ? ? * donahue & baliunas 1992 ) ) .",
    "it is unlikely that such stars possess an anti - solar pattern of surface differential rotation , i.e. , with the poles rotating faster than the equator ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rdiger  1998 ) ) .",
    "therefore , a possible explanation is that their ars migrate poleward instead than equatorward .",
    "this may happen if stellar activity is not confined to latitudes close to the equator , but is well extended toward the poles .",
    "if the dynamo operates in a stellar overshoot region at high latitudes , the direction of migration of the dynamo wave is expected to be poleward in the case of an internal rotation profile similar to that of the sun because @xmath35 at latitudes higher than @xmath36 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thompson  2003 ) ) .",
    "of course , there can be another dynamo wave propagating at low latitudes toward the equator , but the poleward wave may dominate the observed stellar activity if the inclination of the stellar rotation axis is low , i.e. , the star is viewed approximately pole - on .",
    "+ as a development of such studies , ( * ? ? ? * baliunas  ( 2006 ) ) proposed an interpretation for the different shapes of the modulation of the @xmath28 index vs. time in stars showing cycles .",
    "stars with a low level of activity often show an almost sinusoidal modulation , while more active objects display anharmonic variations .",
    "* baliunas  ( 2006 ) ) attribute such a difference to the different dynamo regimes occurring in different stars .",
    "objects with a dynamo number close to the critical value @xmath37 are characterized by an almost sinusoidal variation of the @xmath28 index and by a migration of the activity belts in latitude . on the other hand , stars with @xmath38 show cycles with a markedly non - sinusoidal modulation and their magnetic field does not migrate appreciably in latitude as their cycle progresses , i.e. , there is a weak correlation between the rotation period of their ars and the phase of the cycle .",
    "this interpretation is based on a dynamo model including an @xmath10-quenching mechanism .",
    "it assumes that in stars with a high level of activity the @xmath10 effect is negligible for most of the cycle because the magnetic field intensity is so high as to strongly quench the mean helicity of the turbulence . in this regime ,",
    "the dynamo wave does not migrate appreciably because its rate and direction of migration are controlled by the quantity @xmath20 which is close to zero .",
    "only when the turbulent diffusion of the poloidal field eventually affects the strength of the azimuthal field , the @xmath10 effect is resumed to allow a regeneration of the former .",
    "however , this occurs only for a limited interval of time during each cycle and has no consequences for the migration of the dynamo wave which stays almost stationary .",
    "the prolonged suppression of the @xmath10 effect leads to a remarkably anharmonic variation of the mean magnetic field which implies an anharmonic variation of the @xmath28 index .",
    "+ finally , interesting results have been derived by a comparison of the chromospheric long - term variations with the seasonal optical magnitudes of several h&k project stars for which time series of @xmath39 yr are now available ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lockwood  2007 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hall  2009 ) ) .",
    "they show two different kinds of behaviour : a ) there are stars similar to the sun which become brighter in the optical ( and probably in the bolometric passband ) when they are more chromospherically active ; and , b ) there are stars which become fainter when they are more chromospherically active .",
    "the former have a chromospheric activity level comparable to that of the sun , so their long - term optical variations are dominated by faculae .",
    "the latter are more active than the sun and their ars are dominated by cool spots , so they get fainter when their activity increases .",
    "the variability of the optical flux can be easily monitored from the ground to search for activity cycles if its amplitude is greater than a few 0.01 mag . in this way ,",
    "* messina & guinan ( 2002 ) ) studied cycles in a sample of young solar analogues with spectral types g0v - g5v and ages ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 myr .",
    "although the sample was limited , it was very interesting to study the early evolution of solar activity .",
    "they found that the fastest rotating stars tended to display longer cycles , with the range of the observed cycle periods apparently converging from a large dispersion at ages of @xmath42 myr toward the solar cycle period at the age of the sun .",
    "* messina & guinan ( 2003 ) ) investigated the correlation between the period of the rotational modulation and the phase of the cycle in the above sample of stars finding a clearly significant correlation in two of them , and a less significant correlation in the other four .",
    "both solar - like and anti - solar behaviours were observed , as in the case of the chromospheric cycles of the h&k project sample .",
    "the amplitude of the optical variability on timescales from the rotation period to the cycle period , was well correlated to the inverse of the _ rossby number _ of each star .",
    "the rossby number is defined as : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the rotation period of the star and @xmath45 the correlation time of the turbulent motions at the base of the stellar convection zone , usually set equal to the convective turnover time one mixing length above the base of the convection zone , as computed by means of the standard mixing - length theory . assuming that @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the mixing length at the base of the stellar convective envelope , we find @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the rossby number is a measure of the dynamo number which can be derived by combining observations of the stellar rotational modulation with a model of its internal structure ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* messina & guinan 2003 ) ) .",
    "+ late - type stars in close binary systems are forced into fast rotation by tidal interactions and show a very high level of magnetic activity . among those systems ,",

    "such studies allow us to investigate the back reaction of the lorentz force on stellar rotation in highly non - linear dynamo regimes and can be analyzed on the basis of general models for the angular momentum transport inside a convection zone to derive quantitative estimates of the internal torques and magnetic fields ( see ( * ? ? ?",
