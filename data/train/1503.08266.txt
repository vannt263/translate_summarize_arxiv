    "they arise naturally in applied topology , e.g. @xmath10 is the ech complex or vietoris - rips complex with radius @xmath14 ( so @xmath15 ) .",
    "the desire is to know the holes of @xmath10 ( i.e. nonzero elements of @xmath16 ) which do not seem to go away and ` persist ' ( i.e. are also nonzero in @xmath17 for many @xmath18 ) , as they are the characteristic features that tell us how @xmath8 is built out of all @xmath10 .",
    "in this section , we describe an algebraic formulation of persistent ( co)homology of a simplicial filtration , invented in @xcite and @xcite , and reformulated in @xcite .",

    "let @xmath40 be any field and let the univariate polynomial ring @xmath41 $ ] ( which is a pid by @xcite ) have the standard grading @xmath42 , or equivalently @xmath43 .",
    "the _ persistence complex _ of @xmath44 is the chain complex of graded @xmath19-modules    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the result then follows from the fact that @xmath45 and @xmath46\\otimes r [ y_k|g_l ] \\cong r [ x_i , y_k|f_j , g_l]$ ] and @xmath47\\ast \\lambda [ y_k|g_l ] \\cong \\lambda [ x_i , y_k|f_j , g_l]$ ] .      the following descriptions will be very vague , i am sorry . let us imagine a persistence module @xmath48 ( i.e. the @xmath22-th homology of the persistence complex for @xmath44 over @xmath41 $ ] ) as a ` system of @xmath22-dimensional holes ' that ` vary through time ' . if the ground field @xmath40 has nonzero characteristic , then ` hole ' has a broad meaning .",
    "an element @xmath49 is a @xmath40-linear combination of holes ( let s call it a ` cave ' ) , and over time @xmath50 some of its parts get filled in .",
    "an element of the cartesian power @xmath51 corresponds to the disjoint union of @xmath52 caves : they are independent of each other , since multiplying by @xmath53 affects each component separately .",

    "a pure element @xmath54 is a sequence of @xmath52 caves , but now they affect each other , since @xmath55 . if @xmath56 dies after @xmath12 steps and @xmath57 was born more than @xmath12 steps ago , then @xmath58 is filled in . if @xmath59 is filled in , then so is the whole sequence @xmath60 .",
    "a pure element in @xmath61 is a multisubset of @xmath52 caves , and a pure element of @xmath62 is a subset of @xmath52 caves : again each cave affects the other , but now their ordering is not important .",
