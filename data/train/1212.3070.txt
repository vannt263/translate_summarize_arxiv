    "the lie algebras @xmath3 of infinitesimal cr - automorphisms of various _ model_in the sense of beloshapka  cauchy - riemann ( cr ) generic submanifolds @xmath4 of codimension @xmath1 and of cr dimension @xmath2 are key algebraic features which open the door to a potentially infinite number of new cartan geometries . indeed , the knowledge of @xmath5 and of its isotropy subalgebras @xmath6 at points @xmath7 strongly intervenes when one endeavours to build cartan connections associated to _ all _ _ geometry - preserving _ real analytic deformations @xmath8 of a chosen model .",
    "it is well known that procedures due to cartan and to tanaka exist to perform such constructions ( _ see _",
    "@xcite in a cr context ) , although the practical outcome appears most of the times to be delicate and unpredictable .",
    "in addition , there has recently been an increasing interest towards complete classification of cr - generic submanifolds according to their algebras of infinitesimal cr - automorphisms .",
    "notably , beloshapka and kossovskiy @xcite classified homogeneous cr - generic submanifolds @xmath9 of cr dimension @xmath10 , while a bit before , fels and kaup @xcite classified the levi - degenerate homogeneous @xmath11-nondegenerate hypersurfaces @xmath12 of dimension five .    far beyond for what concerns the appearing ( co)dimensions , beloshapka and his school in the last decade devised general procedures to cook up _ model cr - generic submanifolds _ that , most often , have rigid polynomial defining equations .",
    "but when some concrete equation of a cr - generic manifold is given , one unpleasant obstacle happens to be the _ complexity _ and the _ length _ of the computations that are required to attain the full lie algebras of infinitesimal cr - automorphisms ( _ see _",
    "@xcite ) , an obstacle which motivates the present work .    by @xmath2 and @xmath13 throughout this paper , we shall mean the cr dimension and the codimension of a real analytic local cr - generic submanifold @xmath14 passing through a reference point , say through the origin .",
    "beloshapka in @xcite , introduced a significant class of cr - generic manifolds with several _ nice _ properties ( _ see _ _ e.g. _ theorem 14 in @xcite ) , that he denoted by @xmath15 and called _",
    "universal models_. he also computed the algebras of infinitesimal cr - automorphisms associated to the simplest model @xmath16 in @xcite , and he derived some interesting stability results .",
    "subsequently , shananina computed such algebras for the universal models @xmath17 with @xmath18 in @xcite and derived expected consequences too ( _ see _ theorem 1 , propositions 1 and 2 and corollary 1 of @xcite ) . finally , in @xcite , mamai studied lie algebras of infinitesimal cr - automorphisms associated to some universal models @xmath17 for @xmath19 , though without presenting details . as far as the authors are aware of , in cr dimension @xmath20 , no higher",
    "codimensions have been explored . understandably , as much as the dimension or codimension of a cr - generic submanifold @xmath21 increases , the size and the complexity of the corresponding computations of @xmath22 growths rapidly , hence an automation would be welcome , even a partial one .",
    "serendipitously , an important , recently renewed , much related subject has been extensively studied : _ differential ( computer ) algebra _ , _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite . there",
    ", one employs algebraic tools  like the ones of grbner bases theory  in order to solve systems of partial differential equations , or in order to find the lie symmetries of differential equations , a vast area too .",
    "over the past few years , several relative packages have been developed within various computer algebra systems .",
    "for instance , two maple packages were designed in this direction , firstly differentialalgebra by boulier , lazard , ollivier , petitot ( @xcite ) , and secondly diffgrob2 by mansfield ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to provide an effective algorithm in order to compute the lie algebras @xmath23 associated to model real analytic cr - generic submanifolds @xmath24 , by the valuable means of differential algebra , supplemented by some new operations . for this purpose",
    ", we shall denote by @xmath25 the pde systems that have constant ( complex ) coefficients , precisely as the ones we shall encounter several times . since these systems admit complex - valued equations , we equip at first the fundamental _",
    "ritt s reduction theorem _ with an operator , which we call the _ bar - reduction _ , and we extend it to gain the following conclusion , more appropriate to treat the arising complex - valued @xmath25 pde systems ( _ see _ theorem [ modritt - thm ] ) :    ( extended ritt s reduction theorem ) consider a differential polynomial ring @xmath26 over the field of complex numbers , let @xmath27 be the set of its derivation operators , and let ` @xmath28 ' be a ranking over @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , assume that @xmath30 is a @xmath25 differential polynomial and let @xmath31 be a finite set of @xmath25 differential polynomials",
    ". then , there exists @xmath32 , and for each @xmath33 , there exists @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfying the following conditions :    * @xmath36 * for each @xmath37 appearing in this summation we have : @xmath38 * no term of @xmath39 is a derivation of either @xmath40 or @xmath41 for each @xmath42 .    using this result , we modify the _ rosenfeld - grbner _ algorithm to an algorithm we call the _ lrg _ algorithm ( algorithm [ lrg ] below ) in such a way that it works appropriately in the case of our @xmath25 complex - valued pde systems .",
    "it is noteworthy that , for the sake of simplicity , we study only _ rigid _ cr - generic submanifolds @xmath43 ( _ see _ subsection [ mainstrategy ] for more details ) , because the arising pde systems _ are _ @xmath25 ; of course , a more general algorithm could be described for non - rigid @xmath44 , the pde system still being linear , though with non - necessarily constant coefficients .",
    "specifically , we employ our _ lrg _ algorithm for computing _ explicitly _ the lie algebras of infinitesimal cr - automorphisms associated to the following three real analytic rigid cr - generic submanifolds @xmath45 , represented in coordinates @xmath46 as the graphs of the following _ shared _ six defining equations : @xmath47 together with : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 for this , we use the maple package differentialalgebra to carry out the necessary computations .",
    "nevertheless , these computations involve complex integers and functions and hence it is not possible to perform directly this package in this respect .",
    "that is why , we need also to utilize a new reduction called _ bar - reduction _ that uses complex conjugation to obtain a full remainder ( _ see _ section [ solving pde ] ) . executing long computations",
