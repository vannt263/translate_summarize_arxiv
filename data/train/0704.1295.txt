    "the interest in noncentrosymmetric structures , exhibiting superconductivity , has grown up in the past years .",
    "there are only a few examples of this type , which belong to various classes of materials , e.g. an antiferromagnetic heavy fermion system cept@xmath4si  @xcite , ferromagnetic uranium compound uir , superconducting under pressure  @xcite , or non - magnetic ternary borides li@xmath5pd@xmath4b  @xcite and li@xmath5pt@xmath4b  @xcite .",
    "the main reason , why these systems are especially attracting , is related to the role of inversion symmetry in electron pairing .",
    "the absence of inversion symmetry may suppress the triplet pairing or mix singlet and triplet symmetry @xcite .",
    "very recently , klimczuk and co - workers @xcite synthesised a new type of intermetallic light - element based compound mg@xmath0ir@xmath1b@xmath2 , exhibiting superconductivity near 5  k. this novel material also belongs to the rare noncentrosymmetric structures , and crystallises in a large and rather complex @xmath6 cell ( space group i-43@xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "mg@xmath0ir@xmath1b@xmath2 is partly similar to the li@xmath5(pd , pt)@xmath4b system , since these structures contain an alkali metal ( li , mg ) , boron , and heavy transition metal ( pd , pt , ir ) .    in this work",
    "we intend to start the discussion on superconductivity mechanism in this unusual compound , analysing the electronic structure and the strength of electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) . assuming the bcs - type behaviour in mg@xmath0ir@xmath1b@xmath2",
    ", we study whether superconductivity is driven by light boron sublattices , like e.g. in mgb@xmath5 , or by heavy transition metal atoms , as suggested for li@xmath5pd@xmath4b  @xcite .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed using the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) multiple scattering method @xcite .",
    "the crystal potential was constructed in the framework of the local density approximation ( lda ) , using von barth and hedin formula @xcite for the exchange - correlation part .",
    "for all atoms angular momentum cut - off @xmath8 was set , mesh in the irreducible part of brillouin zone ( irbz ) contained over 200 points .",
    "densities of states ( dos ) were computed using the tetrahedron integration technique , generating over 600 tetrahedrons in irbz . due to the high atomic number of iridium ( @xmath9 )",
    "semi - relativistic calculations were performed , but neglecting the spin - orbit coupling , which is commented at the end of this paper .",
    "the lack of inversion centre is clearly seen e.g. along the main diagonal , where b1 and mg1 atoms break the inversion symmetry . generated by xcrysden @xcite . ]",
    "as far as the crystal structure is concerned , experimental lattice constant and atomic positions @xcite were accounted for the computation ( for clarity also shown in ) .",
    "atoms in the unit cell were surrounded by muffin - tin ( mt ) spheres with following radii : , , ( in atomic units ) , filling about 60% of the cell volume . in the primitive cell of this system ,",
    "45 atoms occupy 7 inequivalent sites , which all are listed in .",
    "the noncentrosymmetricity of this system is important , and can not be regarded as the effect of a lattice distortion , as observed e.g. in uir  @xcite .",
    "the inversion symmetry is broken by both boron sublattices ( b1 and b2 ) , as well as mg1 and ir3 sites , thus the crystal has a half of symmetry operations of the cubic group o@xmath10 , i.e. only 24 operations . among of all sublattices ,",
    "the positions of iridium atoms are the closest to have inversion symmetry .",
    "since ir3 occupies @xmath11 sites , with @xmath12 , the full cubic symmetry is restored after shifting this position to @xmath13 .",
    "the analysis of superconducting properties is based on the computed mcmillan - hopfield ( mh ) parameters @xmath14 @xcite which determine electronic part of the electron - phonon interaction , and directly enter the formula for the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 :    @xmath15    in equation , @xmath16 is the mh parameter for each nonequivalent atom @xmath17 which is characterised by the atomic mass @xmath18 and averaged squared vibrational frequency @xmath19 .",
    "this equation divides the electron - phonon coupling constant into site - dependent parts , thus it allows to justify which sublattice gives the most important contribution to the total @xmath3 .",
    "calculations of mh parameters were preformed using the rigid muffin tin approximation ( rmta ) @xcite , which gives the following expression for @xmath14 at each atomic site @xmath17 : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the angular momentum number , @xmath22 is the partial ( angular - decomposed ) density of states per spin at the fermi energy ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is a regular solution of the radial schrdinger equation , normalised to unity inside the @xmath25 sphere of radius @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the self - consistent , spherically - symmetric potential .",
    "@xmath28 is the total dos at @xmath23 per spin and per cell . for more detailed discussion of approximations involved in this method , see e.g. @xcite and references therein",
    "the calculated total and atomic densities of states functions are presented in .",
    "as one could expect , electronic structure is dominated by iridium @xmath29 states .",
    "the total dos curve may be characterised as a collection of numerous van hove singularities , reflecting the large number of atoms in the unit cell and various interatomic distances .",
    "the site - decomposed dos are shown in , and their values at the fermi level are gathered in . the total dos at fermi level is about @xmath30 ry@xmath31 per formula unit .",
    "the densities at @xmath23 , calculated per atom , are rather low ( average value per atom : 3.3 ry@xmath31 ) , and generally @xmath23 is located outside of dominating peaks of dos , on a small decreasing slope of ir dos . strong hybridisation of @xmath32 states of ir and @xmath33 states of b and mg is manifested in the separation of bonding and anti - bonding states , and @xmath23 is located in the dos valley ( and ) .",
    "the interatomic distances , listed in , supports the enhanced @xmath33-@xmath32 hybridisation , especially between ir and b atoms ( the smallest distances , 2.1 - 2.2  ) .",

    "it is also interesting to compare the computed site - decomposed ir densities , to the dos of metallic @xmath45 iridium , which is presented in ( d ) .",
    "the shape of lower part of dos in ir2 and ir3 is quite similar to the case of ir-@xmath45 .",
    "this is probably due to the fact , that the ir2-ir3 and ir3-ir3 coordination , as well as interatomic distances , are very close to the @xmath45 phase ( ir - ir distance is @xmath46    in the aforementioned cases , see ) .",
    "however , the @xmath35 values on ir atoms are much lower , comparing to @xmath45 structure ( @xmath47 6.3 ry@xmath31/spin in ir-@xmath45 ) , being the effect of enhanced hybridisation near @xmath23 .",
    "noteworthy , ir1 has a quite different atomic coordination , with respect to ir2 and ir3 positions , being surrounded practically only by 4 boron atoms ( b1 ) .",
    "it is clearly reflected by the apparently different dos shape below @xmath23 .",
    "electronic dispersion curves near the fermi level are presented in .",
    "the bands located below @xmath48  ry ( partly showed ) are very flat , and form the narrow large dos peaks , seen already in .",

    "noteworthy , there is an energy gap along the p - n direction ( parallel to the @xmath49 axis in the reciprocal space ) .",

    "the largest contribution to @xmath3 comes from ir3 sublattice , due to the large population of this site . among boron and magnesium sites ,",
    "the b2 and mg1 atoms provide the largest contributions .",
    "however , one has to remember that this comparison is valid only if we assume identical frequencies for the same atoms at different sites . in this simplified analysis",

    "if higher values of @xmath3 are experimentally observed , it will indicate either additional contributions , neglected within the rmta framework , or even lower phonon frequencies , than the values used in the aforementioned estimations .",
    "especially iridium contribution is sensitive to the change of @xmath72 parameter , i.e. increasing it to 25 mev ( probably an upper limit ) results in decrease of @xmath73 to 0.1 , that is to the value found for other sublattices .",

    "the absence of a centre of inversion in a superconductor affects the symmetry of superconducting state , allowing for an admixture of singlet and triplet components  @xcite .",
