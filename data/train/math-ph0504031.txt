    "after the success of the mean field approach for bound state systems in various fields of physics , it was only natural to try the mean field concept for scattering states as well .",
    "the original attempt [ 1 ] was the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) method where one solves the single - particle equations of motion as _ initial _ value problem in time . from the resulting solutions at various impact parameters one",
    "may then calculate the classical cross section . with no specification of the final state , the method",
    "is restricted to inclusive reactions .",
    "a serious , conceptual problem arises from spurious cross channel correlations [ 2,3 ] : when projecting the tdhf slater determinant for large times on an orthogonal set of channel wave functions , the expansion coefficients and the respective s - matrix vary in time ad infinitum . to overcome the shortcomings of tdhf , the time - dependent mean field ( tdmf ) approach [ 2,3,4 ] expands the density in two sets of ( bi - orthogonal ) single - particle wave functions and solves the equations of motion as _ boundary _ value problem in time , fixing initial and final densities .",
    "it has been proven that for tdmf an s - matrix can be defined which becomes asymptotically constant [ 2 ] .",
    "the problem with tdmf lies in combining self - consistency with given boundary conditions in time [ 3,5 ] .",
    "no practicable algorithm for this highly `` non - local '' problem exists upto date for use in actual numerical calculations .",
    "a third approach is the time - independent mean field ( timf ) method [ 6 ] , based on a schwinger - type variational principle [ 7 ] for matrix elements of the resolvent or t - operator between given initial and final states .",
    "the method uses two sets of variational single- particle functions , analogous to tdmf , and leads to inhomogeneous equations of hartree - fock type which can be solved iteratively for given total energy of the system .",
    "timf is free of the conceptual and practical problems of tdhf and tdmf , resp . , and has been tested successfully on a number of simple systems .",
    "it can be extended to incorporate particle - hole correlations , as has also been done for tdhf , within a generalized random - phase - approximation [ 8 ] .",
    "the present paper goes beyond the above problems [ 9 ] by studying the continuum singularities of this timf approach for collisions .",
    "consider a finite number @xmath1 of particles .",
    "factorized wave packets ( shifted gaussians in momentum representation for example ) make an overcomplete basis in their hilbert space of wavefunctions .",
    "hence the calculation of a retarded green s function amplitude @xmath11 where _ i _ ) @xmath3 is a product , @xmath12 and _ ii _ ) each single particle wave function @xmath13 is real rather than complex , makes a fully generic problem .",
    "such factorization simplifications are not physically restrictive and help in the analysis of a mean field theory of collisions , the subject of this paper .    for the sake of simplicity , we deal yet with spinless , distinct particles only and short range interactions @xmath14 for the hamiltonian @xmath15 the case of identical particles can be treated later and , in the following , any reference to a hartree method may be understood as a reference to a hartree - fock ( hf ) method if necessary . again for simplicity , we consider the calculation of diagonal collision amplitudes only , @xmath16 born term subtracted .",
    "generalizations to distinct prior and post interactions , @xmath17 are kept for future work .",
    "the state @xmath18 is taken as a plane wave of relative motion in any two cluster channel ground state and the product @xmath19 is a square integrable state in the @xmath1-particle space .",
    "finally @xmath0 is any complex number @xmath20 and the usual limit @xmath21 at the end of any calculation reads @xmath22    it is trivial to use the schwinger variational principle [ 7 ] and show that @xmath23 is the stationary value of the functional @xmath24 under variations of @xmath25 the corresponding euler - lagrange equations read , with retarded boundary conditions and arbitrary norms and phases of @xmath5 and @xmath26 @xmath27    the variational equations which occur in the time independent mean field ( timf ) [ 6 ] theory of collisions read , @xmath28 they are obtained from eq .",

    "@xmath31 chosen for @xmath32 resp .",
    "@xmath26 are products of single particle orbitals , @xmath33 respectively .",
    "such timf equations are very simple [ 6 ] .",
    "except for a single particle density operator @xmath34 defined non diagonally as @xmath35 they are just hartree(-fock ) equations completed by a right hand side , representing the image of the channel in single particle space . in the following , @xmath36",
    "is restricted to such factorized source functions @xmath3 and trial functions @xmath37 and will be labeled @xmath38 a saddle value under such a restriction of @xmath37 is not necessarily unique any more .",
    "it will be denoted by @xmath39 instead of @xmath23 and may request an additional , identifying label .",
    "now our claim is : _ bound and unbound solutions of the usual hartree(-fock ) equations _ , @xmath40 _ induce singularities of the one - body variational conditions , eqs .",
    "( 3)_.    this reminds , naturally , of the strict connection between the singularities of the linear , inhomogeneous problem @xmath4 in the @xmath1-body space and the solutions of the linear , homogeneous schrdinger equation @xmath9 in the same space . because of the nonlinear nature of eqs .",
    "( 3 - 4 ) in single particle space , our claim is not obvious , and will be qualified in this paper .",
    "actually , in a previous paper [ 10 ] , the claim was already substantiated in part : those energies @xmath41 for which a bound hartree(-fock ) solution @xmath42 is found , generate poles of the approximate amplitude @xmath39 provided by saddle points of the restriction @xmath38 furthermore @xmath43 when @xmath44 despite the nonlinearity of the approximation , such a residue at such a pole is almost expected .",
    "the analogy with the poles of @xmath23 at exact eigenvalues for bound states is striking .",
    "we are now interested in a more difficult question , namely , is there a similar analogy at higher energies , when singularities of scattering and rearrangement collisions ( thresholds , cuts ) occur ?    in section",
    "ii we briefly recall a very simple , soluble model [ 11 ] , used earlier among several other models to validate @xmath39 as an approximation of @xmath45 the model is reintroduced for pedagogical reasons first , to illustrate a derivation of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) . then , and mainly , it is used to provide a complete investigation of singularities , for it boils down to manipulations of polynomials . in section iii",
    "we introduce an enriched model , exactly soluble too .",
    "section iv contains a generalization and discussion of the results obtained in sections ii and iii .",
    "finally section v contains our conclusion .",
    "in this soluble model , there are only two one - dimensional particles with just their kinetic energies , and different masses @xmath46 hence @xmath47 while the inversion of @xmath48 is numerically trivial and allows a good validation [ 11 ] of the timf approximation , the formal expression of @xmath49 in terms of one - body propagators @xmath50 and @xmath51 is less trivial , as it demands a convolution .",
    "the timf method consists in replacing the convolution by just one product , namely @xmath52 this comes from variations @xmath53 of the functional @xmath38 an additional simplification results from a further remark : in those representations where @xmath3 and @xmath2 are real , one finds from eqs .",

    "the `` mismatch '' cancels out .",
    "this indicates that , for any @xmath430 the ratios @xmath431 vanish simultaneously at their respective energies @xmath394 besides threshold limits for each @xmath432 there is an easy interpretation for such a situation , namely , each among such @xmath433 propagation energies converges towards a bound state energy of its @xmath434 indeed , let @xmath435 be an infinitesimal difference between @xmath184 and an isolated eigenvalue of @xmath434 then it is trivial , in an energy representation with biorthogonal eigenstates of @xmath436 to see that @xmath437 diverges at order @xmath438 while @xmath439 diverges at order @xmath440    the situation is thus representative of a hartree(-fock ) solution for the @xmath433 particle system .",
    "this is confirmed by the observation that , since @xmath441 diverges , the potential @xmath442 induced by particle @xmath443 upon any particle @xmath444 vanishes .",
    "indeed , the short range of @xmath445 in the formula , @xmath446 makes the numerator converge @xmath447 while the denominator diverges .",
    "any matrix element @xmath448 will vanish too , for the same reason .",
    "furthermore , the full matrix element @xmath449 can always be split as , @xmath450 where the subscript @xmath451 refers to the subsystem where particle @xmath443 is removed . at the limit under study ,",
    "both @xmath397 and @xmath452 vanish .",
    "hence , according to eq.([misma ] ) , the self energy for particle @xmath443 vanishes and the full matrix element @xmath453 reduces to the subsystem value , @xmath454 furthermore , setting @xmath455 in eq.([eta ] ) , we find that @xmath456 the threshold for the continuum of particle @xmath443 in the @xmath0-plane corresponds to the hartree(-fock ) binding energy of the subsystem .",
    "conversely , if @xmath0 converges towards a hartree(-fock ) bound state energy of an @xmath433 particle system , it is easy to verify that at least one solution of the timf equations for the @xmath1 particle system consists in a threshold wave for the additional particle , as a spectator of the static solution for the subsystem .",
    "notice that several special particles , not just one , can be forced into their continuum thresholds simultaneously .",
    "for instance , if particle @xmath443 and @xmath457 are such that @xmath458 then all potentials @xmath442 and @xmath459 including @xmath460 and @xmath461 vanish , and @xmath462 a subsystem energy for @xmath463 particles .",
    "it can be also noticed that such singularities do not depend upon the source terms @xmath3 and @xmath464 indeed , the locations of such thresholds derive from homogeneous equations , where only @xmath2 appears .",
    "the present theorem can be phrased in a way which generalizes the theorem of [ 10 ] : not only the mean field binding energies of a system of @xmath1 particles define singularities of the timf propagator , but the mean field binding energies of its subsystems define thresholds of cuts where the additional particles become unbound .",
    "there are two parts in this work , namely on the one hand a couple of very special , analytical models , see sections ii and iii , and on the other hand a theorem of a more general validity .",
    "the systems described by our models are physically trivial , since they make non interacting particles .",
    "but their mathematical interest is different . as stated at the beginning of this work , it is important , for large particle numbers , to validate the replacement of convolutions by straight products , and our models allow a detail study of all singularities and nonlinearities introduced by the mean field approximation .",
    "we investigated three representations , namely what happens in , i ) the @xmath0-plane ( propagation energy ) , see for instance figure 4 , ii ) the @xmath39-plane ( timf amplitude ) , see for instance figure 1 , iii ) pseudo momentum planes , such as , for instance the case of @xmath465 see figure 5 . since our models automatically implement an analytic continuation from physical to unphysical sheets , there is no cut to consider in the pseudo momentum complex planes .",
    "it is obvious , however , that for both pseudo momenta @xmath94 and @xmath101 the imaginary axis represents both rims of the cut which would be necessary in their respective @xmath86-plane .",
    "accordingly , see for instance figure 8 , values of @xmath0 for which the real part of a pseudo momentum vanishes , or identically for which a propagation energy @xmath466 becomes real and positive , make cuts in the @xmath0 representation .",
    "the zoology of the timf solutions turns out to be surprisingly rich .",
    "the main two conclusions provided by the models can be listed as follows ,    \\i ) except when the many - body propagation energy @xmath0 has too small an imaginary part , the timf equations always generate at least one branch of solutions where each single particle undergoes a retarded propagation and the timf amplitude @xmath39 shows all suitable properties needed for a reasonable approximation of a green s function matrix element ,    \\ii ) the threshold of a single particle continuum induces the threshold of a cut singularity in the @xmath0 representation ; if one calls `` projectile '' that special particle becoming unbound , and `` target '' the system made by the other particle , the corresponding threshold value for the full propagation energy @xmath0 is the binding energy of the `` target '' .",
    "the theorem derived in section iv , valid for any particle number @xmath467 extends this numerical and analytical evidence .",
    "hence the mean field theory of collisions mimicks the connection between singularities of the inhomogeneous problem @xmath4 and the solutions of the homogeneous schrdinger equation @xmath468 at this stage of our work , the similarity is restricted , however : we considered only partitions where a `` target '' is surrounded by one or several unbound particles , and we have not proven thresholds defined by mean field energies of partitions @xmath469 @xmath470 @xmath471 into two clusters , each of them carrying its full internal energy . nor have we considered even finer partitions @xmath472 with @xmath470 @xmath471 @xmath473 and so on .",
    "last but not least , the present work lacks a clear description of the shapes of the cuts beyond their thresholds . the preliminary result obtained at the stage of figure 8 , with a `` border equation '' like @xmath474 is an omen of subtle arguments yet to be phrased .    despite such questions still open ,",
    "the timf approximation now appears like a theory of collisions endowed with properties , such as poles and thresholds , with sound interpretations in terms of hartree-(fock ) energies of subsystems .",
    "the special role played by single particle energy propagators @xmath475 in the definition of such properties is a logical consequence of the factorization of trial wave functions , an essential ingredient of practical approximations . with the present and foregoing studies",
    ", timf appears as a reliable and practicable alternative to resonating group ( rgm ) or generator coordinate ( gcm ) studies for application in nuclear astrophysics where there is still a demand for microscopic rather than phenomenological calculations of processes relevant to element synthesis .",
