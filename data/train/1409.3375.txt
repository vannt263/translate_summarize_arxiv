    "from the very beginning and up to present days , lattice qcd remains the only practical method to investigate qcd at finite temperature and density from first principles .",
    "recently it underwent a rapid progress ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , lattice qcd is primarily aimed at obtaining well - defined calculation schemes in order to get realistic numbers for physical quantities .",
    "one may therefore get numbers and curves for various thermodynamic quantities / observables , but without understanding what is the physics behind them .",
    "such an understanding can only come from an analytic description of the corresponding lattice data in the whole temperature range and desirably on a general dynamical ground .",
    "so the merger between lattice and analytical approaches to qcd at finite temperature and density is unavoidable , i.e. , they do not exclude each other : on the contrary , they should be complementary .",
    "in other words , numbers and curves come from thermal lattice qcd , while the analytic description of the physics for them comes from the dynamical theory , which is continuous qcd .",
    "there already exist some interesting analytical methods and models based on the mass gap , quasi - particle , glueball gas , liquid , etc .",
    "pictures to analyse results of qcd lattice thermodynamics in different temperature ranges @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the effective potential approach for composite operators @xcite turned out to be a very effective analytical and perspective dynamical tool for the generalization of qcd to non - zero temperature and density . in the absence of external sources",
    "it is nothing but the vacuum energy density ( ved ) , i.e. , the pressure apart from the sign .",
    "this approach is non - perturbative ( np ) from the very beginning , since it deals with the expansion of the corresponding skeleton vacuum loop diagrams in powers of the planck constant , and thus allows one to calculate the ved from first principles .",
    "the key element in this program is the extension of our paper @xcite to non - zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to introduce the correctly defined temperature - dependent bag constant ( bag pressure ) as a function of the mass gap .",
    "it is this which is responsible for the large - scale structure of the qcd ground state @xcite .",
    "it coincides with the jaffe - witten ( jw ) mass gap @xcite by properties , but not by definition .",
    "the confining dynamics in the gluon matter ( gm ) is therefore nontrivially taken into account directly through the mass gap and via the temperature - dependent bag constant itself , but other np effects due to the mass gap are also present .",
    "being np , the effective approach for composite operators , nevertheless , makes it possible to incorporate the thermal perturbation theory ( pt ) expansion in a self - consistent way . in our auxiliary work",
    "@xcite we have formulated and developed the analytic thermal pt which allows one to calculate the pt contributions in terms of the convergent series in integer powers of a small @xmath6 .",
    "we have explicitly derived and numerically calculated the first pt correction of the @xmath6-order to the np part of the gm equation of state ( eos ) or , equivalently , the gluon pressure @xcite .    in this article from the very beginning , we are investigating a system at non - zero temperature , which consists of @xmath0 purely yang - mills ( ym ) gauge fields without quark degrees of freedom ( i.e. , at zero density ) . within our general approach and for future purpose , it is useful to introduce here a following convention : by the gm we understand the above - mentioned system at low temperature below some characteristic temperature @xmath5 ( for its numerical value see section v and fig .",
    "1 ) . the np effects are dominant in this temperature interval . by the gluon plasma ( gp )",
    "in what follows we will understand the same system at rather high temperature above @xmath5 .",
    "however , the np effects are still important in this region up to moderately high temperature . in the limit of very high temperature",
    "this system will become of the so - called stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) one , i.e , consisting of a free ( non - interacting ) massless gluons .",
    "such a separation makes sense , since the system under the consideration is being / staying under rather different extreme conditions below and above @xmath5 despite the existence of the mixed phase between them ( see section ix ) .",
    "the gm eos determines the np thermodynamic structure of the gm at low temperature and still remains important at moderately high temperature , as underlined above . due to the initial normalization condition of the free pt vacuum to zero",
    ", the gluon pressure itself can not achieve the required sb limit at high temperatures . in order to achieve this limit for the full pressure it is necessary to include into the gluon pressure the above - mentioned sb term .",
    "since it can not be simply added to the gm eos at high temperatures , so it has to be done in a more sophisticated way ( see discussion in section vi ) .",
    "such obtained full pressure will be called the gp pressure or , equivalently , the gp eos .",
    "its low temperature limit is to be determined by the gluon pressure itself , so it will be valid for the whole temperature range .",
    "however , the gp pressure will depend on the two auxiliary functions of temperature , which numerical values can be only fixed by using the corresponding @xmath0 lattice thermodynamics data .",
    "how to do this within a self - consistent formalism is precisely one of the main goals of this article .",
    "this will make it possible to analytically describe the above - mentioned lattice thermodynamics with the help of the mass gap , included into the framework of the effective potential approach for composite operators generalized to non - zero temperature .",
    "we will explicitly show how to analytically continue the thermal ym lattice calculations near @xmath5 to the region of very low temperatures where they usually suffer from big uncertainties @xcite ( and see figures below as well ) .",
    "one gets an analytic description of all the lattice thermodynamics results on a general dynamical ground and in the whole temperature range .",
    "in other words , the analytic description of the dynamical structure of @xmath0 gp and the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite ( after inclusion of quarks , i.e. , at non - zero density ) will become possible .",
    "it will be based on all the possible lattice data for the pressure only , since all other thermodynamic observables can be analytically expressed and numerically calculated through the pressure .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the expression for the gluon pressure as a function of temperature is present . in section",
    "iii all the analytical results for the np part of the gluon pressure are collected and briefly explained . in section",
    "iv the analytic thermal pt is discussed in general terms . in section v the gluon pressure up to the first @xmath6-order contribution is analytically calculated .",
    "so in short sections iii , iv and v we describe the results obtained previously in @xcite .",
    "they are present here for the readers convenience in order to have a general picture at hand .",
    "we also think that it is necessary to do since the gluon pressure discussed in these short sections determines the np context of the gp pressure , which is to be analytically and numerically agreed with the lattice thermodynamics results in the next sections .",
    "this is another main subject of the present paper , namely how to generalize our previous results for a rather short temperature range @xcite in order to analytically describe the corresponding lattice data in the whole temperature range .",
    "so in section vi we formulate the procedure how to include the free massless gluons contribution in a self - consistent way into the gp pressure .",
    "a method of the simulating functions is proposed and analytical formulae for the numerical simulations are introduced .",
    "this makes it possible to perform analytical and numerical simulations in order to determine the gp pressure , satisfying all the thermodynamic limits at low- , close to @xmath5- and high temperature limits .",
    "in fact , we formulate a general method how to analytically describe any lattice thermodynamics results in the whole temperature range , using the gluon pressure as input , and vice - versa , i.e. , it describes how the analytically calculated gluon pressure is to be changed ( especially close to @xmath5 and above it ) , using the corresponding lattice thermodynamics results for the pressure as input . in section",
    "vii we display and discuss our numerical results for all the thermodynamic quantities / observables , such as the entropy and energy densities , the heat capacity , etc .",
    ", calculated with the help of the obtained gp pressure . in section viii the analytic description of the dynamical structure of the gp",
    "is given , and in section ix we summarize our conclusions . in appendixes a and b the general expressions for the main thermodynamic quantities as functions of the pressure are given and some analytical formulae for them are derived , respectively . in appendix",
    "c the corresponding @xmath7-function as a function of temperature for the confining effective charge is fixed .",
    "these three appendixes are directly taken from @xcite , but we decided to again present them here explicitly for the readers convenience , since the book @xcite itself is not freely available . in appendix",
    "d the solution of the renormalization group equation for the temperature - dependent pt effective charge is obtained and discussed . in appendix e the latent heat is analytically and numerically evaluated .",
    "some details of the least mean squares method , which has been used in our calculations , are present in appendix f. and finally the results of our numerical calculations of the full gp pressure are shown in table i.",
    "in the imaginary - time formalism @xcite , all of the four - dimensional integrals can be easily generalized to non - zero temperature @xmath8 according to the prescription ( let us remind that in @xcite and in this paper the signature is euclidean from the very beginning )    @xmath9    in other words , each integral over @xmath10 of the loop momentum is to be replaced by the sum over the matsubara frequencies labeled by @xmath11 , which obviously assumes the replacement @xmath12 for bosons ( gluons ) .",
    "introducing the temperature dependence into the gluon pressure @xcite , we obtain    @xmath13    where the corresponding terms in frequency - momentum space are :    @xmath14,\\ ] ]    @xmath15,\\ ] ]    @xmath16.\\ ] ]    in frequency - momentum space the intrinsically non - perturbative ( inp ) and pt effective charges become    @xmath17    and    @xmath18    respectively .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the following notations :    @xmath19    where , evidently , in all the expressions @xmath20 is the square of the three - dimensional loop momentum , in complete agreement with the relations ( 2.1 ) .    in eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) @xmath21 is the mass gap @xcite , mentioned above , which is responsible for the large - scale structure of the qcd vacuum , and thus for its inp dynamics .",
    "recently we have shown that confining effective charge ( 2.6 ) , and hence its @xmath7-function , is a result of the summation of the skeleton ( i.e. , np ) loop diagrams , contributing to the full gluon self - energy in the @xmath22 regime .",
    "this summation has been performed within the corresponding equation of motion @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "it has been done without violating the @xmath0 color gauge invariance of qcd . in more detail ( including the interpretation of eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) and the explanation of all the notations above ) the derivation of the bag constant as a function of the mass gap and its generalization to non - zero temperature has been completed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the pt effective charge @xmath23 ( 2.7 ) is the generalization to non - zero temperature of the renormalization group equation solution , the so - called sum of the main pt logarithms @xcite . here",
    "@xcite is the asymptotic scale parameter for @xmath0 ym fields , and @xmath25 for these fields , while the strong fine - structure constant is @xmath26 @xcite . in eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) @xmath27 can not go below @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 , which has already been symbolically shown in eq .",
    "it is worth reminding that the separation between effective charges ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) , and hence between the terms ( 2.3)-(2.5 ) , is not only exact but it is unique one as well .",
    "it has been done by the subtraction of the pt part from the full gluon propagator with the respect of the mass gap , see @xcite .",
    "the np pressure @xmath30 and the pt pressure @xmath31 , and hence the gluon pressure @xmath32 ( 2.2 ) , are normalized to zero when the interaction is formally switched off , i.e. , letting @xmath33 .",
    "this means that the initial normalization condition of the free pt vacuum to zero holds at non - zero temperature as well .",
    "one of the attractive features of the confining effective charge ( 2.6 ) is that it allows an exact summation over the matsubara frequencies in the np pressure @xmath34 given by the sum of the integrals ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) .",
    "collecting all analytical results summarized in our previous work @xcite , we can write    @xmath35,\\ ] ]    and    @xmath36    while    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and the mass gap @xmath39 for @xmath0 gauge theory have been fixed in @xcite , and this choice has been explained as well . here",
    "let us only remind that @xmath40 is a scale separating the low- and high frequency - momentum regions .",
    "then @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given by the relations    @xmath43    and    @xmath44    respectively .",
    "it is worth reminding that in the np pressure ( 3.1 ) the bag pressure @xmath45 ( 2.3 ) is responsible for the formation of the massive gluonic excitations @xmath41 ( 3.4 ) , while the ym part @xmath46 ( 2.4 ) is responsible for the formation of the massive gluonic excitations @xmath42 ( 3.5 ) .",
    "the so - called gluon mean number @xcite is    @xmath47    where @xmath7 and @xmath48 are defined in eq .",
    "it appears in the integrals ( 3.2)-(3.3 ) and describes the distribution and correlation of massless gluons in the gm . replacing @xmath48 by @xmath42 and @xmath41 we can consider the corresponding gluon mean numbers as describing the distribution and correlation of the corresponding massive gluonic excitations in the gm , see integrals @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eq .",
    "they are of np dynamical origin , since their masses are due to the mass gap @xmath21 .",
    "all three different gluon mean numbers range continuously from zero to infinity @xcite .",
    "we have the two different massless excitations , propagating in accordance with the integral ( 3.2 ) and the first of the integrals ( 3.3 ) .",
    "however , they are not free , since in the pt @xmath51 limit they vanish ( the composition @xmath52 $ ] becomes zero in this case ) .",
    "so the np pressure describes the four different gluonic excitations ( see section viii below as well ) .",
    "the gluon mean numbers are closely related to the pressure . its exponential suppression in the @xmath53 limit and the polynomial structure in the @xmath54 limit",
    "are determined by the corresponding asymptotics of the gluon mean numbers .",
    "the low- and high - temperature expansions for the np pressure ( 3.1 ) have been derived in @xcite .",
    "concluding , let us emphasize that the effective scale @xmath40 is not an independent scale parameter . from the stationary condition at zero temperature @xcite and the scale - setting scheme at non - zero temperature @xcite it follows that    @xmath55    so it is expressed in terms of the initial fundamental scale parameter - the mass gap .",
    "its introduction is convenient from the technical point of view in order to simplify our expressions which otherwise will be rather cumbersome .",
    "our primary goal in the previous article @xcite was to develop the analytic formalism for the numerical calculation of the pt term ( 2.5 ) .",
    "it makes it possible to calculate the pt contribution ( 2.5 ) to the gluon pressure ( 2.2 ) in terms of the convergent series in integer powers of a small @xmath6 . for this goal , it is convenient to re - write the integral ( 2.5 ) as follows :    @xmath56 - { 3 \\over 4 } \\alpha^{pt}(\\omega^2 , \\omega^2_n ) \\right],\\ ] ]    where    @xmath57    with the help of the expressions ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) , and where    @xmath58,\\ ] ]    and @xmath59 is given in eq .  ( 3.5 ) .",
    "let us also note that in these notations    @xmath60    collecting all results obtained in @xcite , we are able to present the pt part of the gluon pressure as a sum of the two terms , namely    @xmath61    where    @xmath62    with    @xmath63.\\ ] ]    here @xmath64 ( 4.6 ) describes the @xmath21-dependent pt contribution to the np term @xmath34 ( 3.1 ) , beginning with the @xmath6-order term .",
    "in fact , the whole expansion ( 4.6 ) is the correction in integer powers of @xmath6 to the np term @xmath34 ( 3.1 ) , i.e. , to call it the pt term is only convention .",
    "the @xmath65-order term is also a sum of the two terms , one of which depends on the mass gap and the other one does not .",
    "the corresponding convergent expansions in integer powers of a small @xmath6 for them begins with @xmath65-order terms , see @xcite .",
    "they are not shown explicitly , since numerically they are much smaller than the first term in eq .",
    "( 4.5 ) . for this reason",
    "their consideration will be omitted in what follows .",
    "taking into account the above - mentioned remarks , the gluon pressure ( 2.2 ) then becomes    @xmath66    here @xmath67 is the @xmath6-order term in the expansion ( 4.6 ) for @xmath64 , namely @xmath68 , and for @xmath69 see eq .",
    "it is better to re - write the np pressure ( 3.1 ) in a slightly different form , namely @xmath70 , where @xmath71 $ ] . in the integral ( 4.7 ) for @xmath72 the summation over the matsubara frequencies can be performed analytically ( i.e. , exactly ) . for the explicit expressions of the integrals @xmath73 and @xmath67 see below .",
    "it is instructive to gather all our results obtained previously @xcite for the gluon pressure as follows :    @xmath74    where the integrals @xmath75 and @xmath67 are    @xmath76    and    @xmath77    respectively , while all other integrals @xmath78 are given in eq .",
    "here it is worth noting only that the pt term ( 5.4 ) describes the same massive gluonic excitations @xmath42 ( 3.5 ) , but their propagation , however , suppressed by the @xmath6-order . we can consider it as a new massive excitation in the gm , denoted it as @xmath79 .",
    "let us remind once more that the term @xmath67 is np , depending on the mass gap @xmath21 , which is only suppressed by the @xmath6 order .",
    "when the interaction is formally switched off , i.e. , letting @xmath80 , the above - defined composition @xmath81 becomes zero , as it follows from eqs .",
    "( 3.3 ) , and thus the gluon pressure @xmath32 itself shown in ( 5.2 ) .",

    "from this table one can conclude that @xmath67 term is one order of magnitude smaller that @xmath34 term up to moderately high temperature , while in the limit of high temperature it becomes dominant ( see discussion at the end of this section as well ) .",

    "the problem is that in this case the pressure will get a jump at @xmath115 , which is not acceptable .",
    "the full pressure is always a continuous growing function of temperature at any point of its domain .",
    "this means that we should add some other terms valid below @xmath5 in order to restore a continuous character of the full pressure across @xmath5 .",
    "this can be achieved by imposing a special continuity condition on these terms valid just at @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the gluon pressure @xmath32 itself should be additionally multiplied by the functions which are always negative below and above @xmath5 .",

    "all these problems make the inclusion of the sb term into eos highly non - trivial .",

    "the role of the auxiliary function @xmath118 is to change the behavior of @xmath121 from @xmath32 at low ( l ) temperatures below @xmath5 , especially in its near neighborhood , as well as to take into account the suppression of the sb - type terms below @xmath5 .",

    "we also give the explanation why the gp should undergo a first - order phase transition in our picture . at long last ,",
    "it is due to principally different asymptotics of the gluon pressure @xmath32 in the low- and high temperatures limits ; exponential and power types , respectively ( see section v ) .",

    "the lms method gave the value of the gp pressure at @xmath5 approximately two times bigger than the actual lattice pressure is at @xmath5 in @xcite .",
    "at the same time , here we were able to cover all the possible ( above @xmath5 ) temperature interval @xmath337 which included 162 lattice data points , increasing thus drastically the accuracy of the lms method .",
    "also , we have correctly reproduced the lattice pressure values below @xmath5 but close to @xmath5 and at @xmath5 itself , which we failed to do in @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "all this led to rather different pictures obtained previously and here ( compare figs .",

    "2,3 , and 15 in this paper ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the approach to sb limit has been fixed empirically , while in this paper it has been fixed by the numerical , in fact , solution of the renormalization group equation for the pt effective charge ( see appendix d ) . despite the similarity of some figures there and here , the numbers behind them are significantly different ( compare eqs .",

    "this is also true for the initial renormalization group equation ( d1 ) , which includes only integer powers of @xmath143 .",
    "so one can conclude that the above - discussed composition correctly describes the af approach to the sb limit , i.e. , it should be approached slowly ( logarithmically ) and always from below , not depending on the order of the pt expansion used .",
    "any correctly calculated np contribution has not to change such character of the behavior of the full pressure at very high temperatures ( for more detail discussion go back to subsection vii.a , in particular see fig . 5 and discussion around it ) .",
    "however , the direct analytical derivations in the thermal pt qcd have discovered a non - analytic dependence on the coupling constant in the pt series for the pressure ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so the pt qcd pressure ( normalized to the sb pressure and possessing correct high temperature limit ) in this case can be expressed as follows :    @xmath400    where    @xmath401    for the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath402 ( including their signs ) and analytic expression for @xmath143 itself see @xcite .",
    "a non - analytic dependence of the pt pressure on the temperature - dependent coupling constant means that the above - shown expansion is not convergent .",
    "for example , if somebody will be able to analytically derive the term beyond the last analytically known @xmath403-order term , nevertheless , it may be positive and numerically much bigger than the previous one .",
    "such an effect is clearly seen in fig .",
    "14 , where the @xmath404-order term is numerically bigger than the previous one , indeed . in this case",
    ", the sb limit will be approached from above , which is not acceptable , of course . in other words ,",
    "the expansion for @xmath143 in powers of @xmath6 is convergent , while the expansion ( d9 ) in powers of @xmath143 itself is not .",
    "however , up to the @xmath403-order term the pure gauge lattice qcd @xcite ( and references therein ) is compatible with analytic one as it follows from fig .",
    "14 as well .",
    "so we are going to describe the lattice results for the pure gauge qcd obtained in @xcite in a forthcoming paper . in any case , their simulations need an independent investigation within our general formalism , since they fix the sb limit explicitly , while in the pure gauge lattice qcd simulations @xcite ( used in the present paper ) this limit has not been fixed analytically .",

    "<S> a general approach how to analytically describe and understand @xmath0 lattice thermodynamics in the whole temperature range @xmath1 is formulated and used . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the effective potential approach for composite operators properly extended to non - zero temperature and density . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to introduce into this general formalism the mass gap , which is responsible for the large - scale dynamical structure of the qcd ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the mass gap dependent gluon plasma pressure adjusted by this approach to the corresponding lattice data is shown to be a continuously growing function of temperature being thus differentiable in every point of its domain . at the same time , the entropy and energy densities have finite jump discontinuities at some characteristic temperature @xmath2 with latent heat @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a firm evidence of the first - order phase transition in @xmath0 pure gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity has a @xmath4-type singularity ( an essential discontinuity ) at @xmath5 , so that the velocity of sound squared becomes zero at this point . </S>",
    "<S> all the independent thermodynamic quantities are exponentially suppressed below @xmath5 and rather slowly approach their respective stefan - boltzmann limits at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> those thermodynamic quantities which are the ratios of their independent counterparts such as conformity , conformality and the velocity of sound squared approach their stefan - boltzmann limits rather rapidly and demonstrate a non - trivial dependence on the temperature below @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the trace anomaly relation ( the interaction measure ) and closely related to it the gluon condensate , which are especially sensitive to the non - perturbative effects . </S>",
    "<S> all the calculated thermodynamic quantities have a complicated and rather different dependence on the mass gap and temperature across @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical description of the dynamical structure of @xmath0 gluon plasma is given . </S>"
