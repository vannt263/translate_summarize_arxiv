    "magnetic fields determine observational manifestations of neutron stars . soon after the discovery of the first radio pulsars , the decay of their magnetic field was supposed by  @xcite .",
    "therefore comprehension of magnetic fields behavior aids not only in more accurately finding real pulsar ages , but also helps us understand the physical processes inside isolated neutron stars .",
    "first of all we carefully consider behavior of spin - down age of radio pulsar : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is period of pulsar and @xmath9 is its derivative .",
    "it appears that @xmath1 is highly sensitive to changes in magnetic fields of ns .",
    "we find that it is possible to introduce an additional real pulsar age estimation based on the counts of pulsars with fixed spin - down age @xmath1 .",
    "if we suppose that the law governing magnetic - field decay is identical for all pulsars , and can be present by the formula @xmath10 , then it is possible to restore the dimensionless factor @xmath5 irrespectively of initial pulsar period distribution and initial distribution of their magnetic fields .",
    "this factor can be expressed as @xmath11 the algorithm and detailed description of our method of restoring the function @xmath5 is described in  @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the effects of the observational selection .",
    "results of restoring the function @xmath5 by our method might be distorted by the significant observational selection effects .",
    "in fact , we observe only a small part of all galactic pulsars .",
    "and we can not be sure exactly that this small part correctly reproduces characteristics of the whole galactic ensemble of the nss .",
    "indeed , selection effects are able to hide some group of pulsars from our attention . in this case",
    "the selection effects can change an average and a variance of the parameters of the whole ensemble of the ns distribution .",
    "on the other hand it is difficult to estimate this selection effects theoretically because of our poor understanding of the radiation mechanism for pulsars .",
    "therefore , we will carefully analyze the observational data .",
    "we select the isolated radio - pulsars excluding the millisecond pulsars from the atnf pulsar catalog by  @xcite .",
    "we divide them into five groups , where the spin - down age @xmath1 is expressed in years : @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 $ ] , @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 $ ] and plot their cumulative distribution over their distance from the sun in fig .   [ obser_select ] .",
    "it is clear that for pulsars of middle ages @xmath17 $ ] the radial distributions are similar .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms , with a probability of more than 99% , that these four samples can be described by a single distribution function . on the other hand",
    "the radial distribution of the group of older pulsars with @xmath18 $ ] years is different .",
    "therefore , our conclusions below are correct only for pulsars from the four first age intervals .",
    "let us consider a cylinder in the galaxy , centered on the sun , with a radius 10 kpc and with its axis normal to the galactic plane .",
    "our selection is similar to those by  @xcite , but with a larger cylinder radius .",
    "as we study the relative quantities , the total number of objects which fall in the cylinder is not important .",
    "we can show that the observational selection which does not conceal pulsars with certain ages is harmless for our analysis .",
    "let us divide our cylinder with 10 kpc radius into two parts : the inner cylinder a with radius 1.5 kpc and remained part b of the large cylinder .",
    "the objects in cylinder a are belong to the local pulsar population .",
    "designate the number of pulsars with spin - down ages in the interval @xmath19 $ ] inside the cylinder a as @xmath20 and as @xmath21 for those which are in part b of the large cylinder .",
    "for second interval of the spin - down ages @xmath22 $ ] we designate the corresponding values as @xmath23 in a and @xmath24 . as it known from paper by @xcite the observational selection effects are weak for object in the cylinder a. therefore , we can estimate the ratio @xmath25 with high level of confidence . as it was discussed above the radial distribution function for pulsars of different spin - down",
    "ages are similar .",
    "it means that @xmath26 gathering the pulsars from parts a and b of the large cylinder together we can write the next relation : @xmath27 we find that the count of pulsars in the large cylinder does not change the result . in the other hand ,",
    "the larger number of pulsars located in the large cylinder allows us to make more precise conclusions .",
    "$ ] years , green dashed line  to @xmath28 $ ] years , blue short - dashed line  to @xmath29 $ ] years , violet dotted line  to @xmath30 $ ] years and sky blue dashed and dotted line - to @xmath18 $ ] years .",
    "each interval of ages includes about of 100 pulsars .",
    ", width=460 ]",
    "a new statistical method which allows us to restore history of magnetic fields decay for middle age neutron stars was developed by  @xcite .",
    "this method was applied to a real sample of radio pulsars from the atnf catalog .",
    "we find that the surface magnetic fields of middle age radio pulsars decay following a modified power law : @xmath31 with parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 years .",
    "it was found that observational selection is negligible when we take into consideration only part of all galactic volume .",
    "this effect is connected with similarity of radial distribution for radio pulsars of different ages in range @xmath36 $ ] years .",
    "we also estimate the pulsar birthrate supposing that pulsars with the spin - down age over @xmath37 years have not experienced significant magnetic - field decay .",
    "this produces a birth rate of about @xmath38 pulsars per century ."
