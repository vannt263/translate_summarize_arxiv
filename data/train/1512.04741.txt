    "the multi variate mixture dynamics model ( mvmd ) introduced by brigo , mercurio and rapisarda @xcite and recently described in a deeper way in brigo , rapisarda and sridi @xcite is a tractable dynamical arbitrage - free model defined as the multidimensional version of the lognormal mixture dynamics model ( lmd ) in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the single - asset lmd model is a no - arbitrage model widely used among practitioners , on the basis of its practical advantages in calibration and pricing ( analytical formulae for european options , explicit expression for the local volatility ) , and of its flexibility and accuracy .",
    "in fact , a variant of this model is presently used in the calibration of implied volatility surfaces for single stocks and equity indices on the bloomberg terminal @xcite , and for the subsequent pricing of european , american and path - dependent options on single assets and baskets of assets . the main advantage of the mvmd over other multidimensional models such as the wishart model ( @xcite and @xcite ) stands in its tractability and flexibility which allows the mvmd to possibly calibrate index volatility smiles consistently with the univariate assets smiles .",
    "in addition a full description of its dependence structure ( terminal correlations , average correlations , copula function ) is available .",
    "the mvmd model enjoys also some interesting properties of markovian projection .",
    "first of all , the model can be seen as a markovian projection of a model with uncertain volatilities denominated muvm model . as a consequence ,",
    "european option prices under the mvmd model can be more easily computed under the muvm model instead",
    ". however , the projected model remains superior in terms of smoothness and dynamics .",
    "secondly , the geometric average basket under the mvmd model can be projected into a univariate lognormal mixture dynamics model .",
    "consequently , european option prices on the basket can be easily computed through the black and scholes formula .    finally , under the mvmd model",
    "the terminal correlation between assets and squared volatilities is zero .",
    "this overcomes a common drawback of other local volatility models .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the mvmd model including shifts on the dynamics of the single assets and we study the correlation skew under this framework .    before going into details we recapitulate the definition of mvmd model ( in the non shifted case ) , starting with the univariate lmd model and then generalizing to the multidimensional case .      given a maturity @xmath0",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the price at time @xmath2 of the zero - coupon bond maturing at @xmath3 and by @xmath4 a probability space with a filtration @xmath5}$ ] that is @xmath6-complete and satisfying the usual conditions .",
    "we assume the existence of a measure @xmath7 equivalent to @xmath6 called the risk  neutral or pricing measure , ensuring arbitrage freedom in the classical setup , for example , of harrison , kreps and pliska . in this framework",
    "we consider @xmath8 purely _ instrumental _ diffusion processes @xmath9 with dynamics @xmath10 and a deterministic initial value @xmath11 marginal densities @xmath12 and diffusion coefficient @xmath13 defined as follows @xmath14 = : \\ell^i_t(x )   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath15 deterministic .",
    "we define @xmath16 as the solution of @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a local volatility function , namely a deterministic function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 only , and it is computed so that the marginal density @xmath21 of @xmath22 is a linear convex combination of the instrumental processes densities @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath23 the parameter @xmath24 is completely specified by @xmath7 : if the asset is a stock paying a continuous dividend yield @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the time @xmath3 constant risk - free rate then @xmath27 , if the asset is an exchange rate and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the ( deterministic ) domestic and foreign rates at time @xmath3 respectively then @xmath30 , if the asset is a forward price then @xmath31 .",
    "brigo and mercurio @xcite proved that defining @xmath32 and assuming few additional nonstringent assumptions on the @xmath33 , the corresponding dynamics for @xmath16 admits a unique strong solution .",

    "then the lognormal mixture dynamics model ( lmd ) defined by @xmath39 admits a unique strong solution and the forward kolmogorov equation ( fokker planck equation ) for its density admits a unique solution satisfying , which is a mixture of lognormal densities .",
    "an important consequence of the above construction is that european option prices on @xmath20 can be written as linear combinations of black - scholes prices with weights @xmath40 .",
    "the same combination holds for the greeks at time @xmath2 .",
    "consider now @xmath41 different asset prices @xmath42 each calibrated to an lmd model , as in equation ( [ eq : dcmix ] ) , and denote by @xmath43 , @xmath44 the parameters relative to the @xmath45-th instrumental process of the asset @xmath46 .",
    "there are two possible ways in order to connect the dynamics of the single assets into a multivariate model . the first more immediate way consists in introducing a non - zero quadratic covariation between the brownian motions driving the lmd models of equation ( [ eq : dcmix ] ) for @xmath42 leading to the so - called scmd model .",

    "this is equivalent to the following @xmath41-dimensional diffusion process where we keep the @xmath52 s independent and where we embed the brownian covariation into the diffusion matrix @xmath53 , whose @xmath46-th row we denote by @xmath54 : @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath3 represents the transposition operator .",
    "* assumption .",
    "* we assume @xmath57 to be positive definite .",
    "it is evident from the previous construction that the scmd is consistent with both the dynamics of the single assets @xmath58 and the instantaneous correlation matrix @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , we can easily simulate a path of @xmath20 by exogenously computing @xmath59 for example from historical data , assuming it constant over time and applying a naive euler scheme .",
    "however an explicit expression for the density of @xmath47 $ ] under the scmd dynamics is not available . as a consequence ,",
    "if we aim at computing prices of options whose payoff depends on the value at time @xmath3 only we still need to simulate entire paths of @xmath60 over the interval @xmath61 $ ] , which can be quite time consuming .",
    "a different approach , still consistent with the single assets dynamics , lies in merging the dynamics of the single assets in such a way that the mixture property is lifted to the multivariate density and the corresponding model gains some further tractability property with respect to the scmd model .",
    "this can be achieved by mixing in all possible ways the densities of the instrumental processes of each individual asset and by imposing the correlation structure @xmath59 at the level of the single instrumental processes , rather than of the assets as we did for the scmd model .",
    "this has important consequences on the actual structure of the correlation , see @xcite .",
    "below we summarize the construction leading to the mvmd model , while referring to brigo et al .",
    "@xcite for further details .",

    "this leads to more realistic dynamics .    under mild assumptions , existence and uniqueness of a solution",
    "can be proved through the following theorem .",
    "assume that the volatilities @xmath85 for all @xmath46 are once continuously differentiable , uniformly bounded from below and above by two positive real numbers @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively , and that they take a common constant value @xmath38 for @xmath88 $ ] for a small positive real number @xmath89 , namely @xmath90.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assume also the matrix @xmath59 to be positive definite .",

    "the diffusion matrix @xmath91 in ( [ c ] ) is positive definite for all @xmath19 and @xmath92 .",
    "when modelling a one dimensional asset price through an lmd model , implied volatilities with minimum exactly at a strike equal to the forward asset price are the only possible . in order to gain greater flexibility and",
    "therefore move the smile minimum point from the atm forward we can shift the overall density by a deterministic function of time , carefully chosen in order to preserve risk  neutrality and therefore guarantee no  arbitrage .",
