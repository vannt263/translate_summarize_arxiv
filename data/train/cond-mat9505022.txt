    "<S> a bi - layer quantum frustrated antiferromagnet is studied using an effective action approach . </S>",
    "<S> the action derived from the microscopical hamiltonian has the form of the @xmath0 non - linear sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> it is solved in the mean field approximation with the ultraviolet cut off chosen to fit numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained phase diagram displays a decrease in the critical value of interlayer coupling with increase of in - plane frustration . the critical point for a single - layer frustrated antiferromagnet ( the @xmath1-@xmath2 model ) </S>",
    "<S> is estimated to be .    in the past few years , a lot of attention has been given to order - disorder transitions in two - dimensional antiferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> much of the interest stems from relevance of the problem to high - temperature superconductors where such transitions occur . </S>",
    "<S> although in superconductors the transition is driven by mobile holes , it can also be studied in a frustrated antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnet with frustrating interaction between next nearest neighbours ( the @xmath1-@xmath2 model ) is the simplest case and has often been studied.@xcite    in this paper , i study a _ bi - layer _ frustrated antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the bi - layer problem has emerged from the studies of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 which consists of pairs of close cuo@xmath3 planes . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , there are a number of differences between bi - layer and single layer compounds.@xcite recent infrared measurements@xcite suggest that the antiferromagnet interlayer coupling within bi - layers may be as strong as 60 mev ( about half of the in - plane coupling ) in which case it must be taken into account in any theoretical study . </S>",
    "<S> several authors have discussed pairing in bi - layer models.@xcite this work is restricted to studying magnetic order in the static antiferromagnet .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is taken in the form @xmath6 where the summation is performed over a square lattice , nn denotes nearest neighbours , 2n ( 3n ) stands for second ( third ) neighbours , and the two planes within the bi - layer are labelled as 1 and 2 ( it is assumed that all interactions @xmath7 are positive ) .    in case @xmath8 the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) reduces to a frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> increasing @xmath2 and @xmath9 leads to a quantum phase transition into a disordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of the critical coupling @xmath10 ( at @xmath11 ) is , however , known very poorly .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of @xmath12 ( a bi - layer antiferromagnet ) has also received a lot of attention.@xcite availability of reliable numerical results@xcite for this case makes it a convenient model@xcite for testing theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> the bi - layer antiferromagnet has also been used@xcite to explain some experimental results in bi - layer superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> however , the value of interlayer coupling required for this ( @xmath13 ) is too large to be realistic . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , both in - plane and inter - plane effects are important . in the presence of in - plane frustration the critical value of interlayer coupling </S>",
    "<S> may be drastically reduced .    in both the bi - layer antiferromagnet and single layer frustrated antiferromagnet , the mean field spin wave and mean field schwinger boson theories significantly overestimate the region of stability of the nel ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for this appears to be that these theories assume long range order from the start and do not include some types of fluctuations ( see discussion of longitudinal spin fluctuations in bi - layer antiferromagnet in ref .  ) .    in this study </S>",
    "<S> , i use an effective action approach which is based on mapping the microscopic hamiltonian onto the quantum @xmath0 non - linear sigma model and which has been extensively applied to two - dimensional antiferromagnets . using a @xmath14 expansion of the non - linear sigma model , chubukov , sachdev , and jinwu ye@xcite </S>",
    "<S> have recently presented a comprehensive analysis of the general properties of clean two - dimensional antiferromagnets in the vicinity of the order - disorder transition . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement with numerical and experimental data has been obtained .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> i first derive the effective action for the bi - layer frustrated antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed then that for the purposes of the study , the action can be reduced to that of the standard one - band non - linear sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram is then found using the mean field ( saddle point ) solution with the ultraviolet cut off ( or , equivalently , the critical coupling ) adjusted so as to fit numerical results for the bi - layer antiferromagnet .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several ways to obtain the action . </S>",
    "<S> i follow the derivation based on coherent state representation.@xcite each spin is represented by a single unit vector @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> then all spin configurations are expressed as a combination of four fields ( two fields per layer ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 for the two sublattices , and @xmath19 is the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the unit length fields @xmath20 in the classical limit describe orientation of the local nel ordering and the fields @xmath21 represent small local fluctuations .    now </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is expressed using eq .  </S>",

    "<S> one mode acquires a gap @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no general solution in this case because of the presence of the term @xmath35 in the action . </S>",
    "<S> however , at larger @xmath33 and @xmath36 the action can be simplified due to the fact that it is dominated by configurations with @xmath37 . in this regime of coupled planes , </S>",

    "<S> ( [ velocity ] ) for the bi - layer antiferromagnet the spin wave velocity at the critical point @xmath44 is @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is in good agreement with numerical results@xcite which suggests that @xmath46 corrections are negligible at this point . </S>",
    "<S> the spin stiffness eq .  ( [ rho ] ) is twice as large as in the regime of independent planes . </S>",
    "<S> thus when @xmath33 is introduced the system first becomes more `` classical '' ( in other words , the effective spin @xmath47 increases ) and then evolves towards the quantum disordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was observed in earlier studies@xcite at a fairly small value of @xmath48 . with in - plane frustration </S>",
    "<S> present the crossover will occur at even smaller values of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in a recent exact diagonalisation study of the bi - layer @xmath49-@xmath7 model,@xcite it was noticed that the two layers become essentially correlated at @xmath50 . )    </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ z2 ] ) represents the quantum @xmath0 non - linear sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> not being interested in details of the critical behaviour , i use the simplest mean field solution which is exact for the @xmath51 non - linear sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> an ultraviolet cut off must be introduced in momentum integration and a pauli - villars cut off is a convenient choice.@xcite in the mean field approximation , there are spin-1 excitations with a gapped spectrum and no damping . </S>",
    "<S> straightforward calculations show that the gap @xmath52 is determined form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the critical coupling ( @xmath55 is the cut off ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system is ordered at @xmath32 when @xmath56 . knowing the critical point at @xmath57 allows to eliminate uncertainty from the cut off . </S>",
