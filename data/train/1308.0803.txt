    "laser cooling of atoms or molecules relies on the repeated excitation and spontaneous emission of light  @xcite . when the atom or molecule reaches a dark state , i.e. , a state that does not interact with the laser light , it escapes from the cooling cycle .",
    "if this occurs before the particle is sufficiently cooled , repumping is required .",
    "the presence of too many levels that act as dark states has prevented laser cooling to work for most molecular species .",
    "however , dark states can also be used to an advantage in laser cooling when they are populated only by the cooled particles .",
    "this is utilized for example in subrecoil cooling based on velocity selective coherent population trapping  @xcite .",
    "dark states also play a crucial role in the laser cooling of internal degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the presence of many internal levels requires a broadband optical excitation which can be realized by femtosecond laser pulses .",
    "cooling occurs if the target level is populated by spontaneous emission but remains dark to the laser pulse  @xcite .",
    "the dark state can be realized by destructive interference or simply by removing the frequency components corresponding to excitation of the target level .",
    "the latter has recently been realized experimentally , resulting in successful demonstration of laser cooling of vibrations  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , cooling the internal degrees of freedom by broadband optical pumping was preceded by standard laser cooling of atoms to temperatures of the order of 100@xmath1k and then photoassociating the atoms into weakly bound excited state molecules .",
    "photoassociation  @xcite is followed by spontaneous emission , yielding molecules in the ground electronic state .",
    "depending on the choice of excited state potential , a significant part of the molecules might end up in ground state levels with comparatively small vibrational quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "these molecules can be laser cooled by broadband optical pumping as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pots_cooling ] : an incoherent ensemble of molecules in different vibrational levels of the electronic ground state is excited by a broadband laser pulse to an electronically excited state .",
    "the electronically excited molecules will decay by spontaneous emission back to the ground state .",
    "the branching ratio for the different ground state vibrational levels is determined by the franck - condon factors or , more precisely , transition matrix elements , between ground and excited state levels .",
    "some decay will always lead to the ground vibrational level .",
    "repeated broadband optical pumping then accumulates the molecules in the ground vibrational level  @xcite .",
    "the overall cooling rate is determined by the timescale of the dissipative step , i.e. , the spontaneous emission lifetime  @xcite .",
    "it can not be modified by the coherent interaction of the molecules with the laser pulse .",
    "however , the pulses can be shaped such as to populate those excited state levels which preferentially decay into the target level .",
    "here we show that this minimizes the number of required optical pumping cycles .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that optimal pulse shapes allow for cooling even in cases where the franck - condon map is preferential to heating rather than cooling .",
    "this is the case when the excited state levels show similar einstein coefficients for many ground state vibrational levels . rather than accumulating the molecules in a single target level ,",
    "spontaneous emission then distributes the population incoherently over many levels , effectively heating the molecules up .",
    "we employ optimal control theory to calculate the pulse shapes . instead of treating the full dissipative dynamics of the excitation / spontaneous emission cycle , we take advantage of the timescale separation between the coherent interaction of the molecules with the laser pulse , on the order of 10@xmath2ps , and the spontaneous decay with excited state lifetimes of the order of 10@xmath2ns . seeking a pulse that populates those excited state levels with the largest einstein coefficients with the target ground state level",
    "allows us to treat the decay implicitly .",
    "we formulate two optimization functionals that are independent of the specific initial state .",
    "thus we obtain an optimized pulse shape that remains unchanged over the complete cooling process consisting of many repeated excitation / spontaneous emission cycles .",
    "the two optimization functionals realize different cooling mechanisms : one is based on optical pumping from all thermally populated ground state levels symmetrically , whereas the other one forces the thermally populated ground state levels into an assembly line. only the first level in the line is transferred to the excited state while population from all other levels is reshuffled , one after the other into the first level , via raman transitions . this suppresses heating actively and allows us to answer the question of what is the fundamental requirement of the molecular structure to allow for cooling .",

    "we construct @xmath35 such as to avoid solution of the liouville von neumann equation for the density matrix during optimization .",

    "we discuss two possible choices for the final - time functional .      the main idea of this functional is to excite all vibrationally excited ground state levels symmetrically into those excited state levels which preferentially decay toward the target state @xmath43 while minimizing potential heating .",

    "the initial state for each laser pulse is given by an unknown incoherent distribution over ground state vibrational levels , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "each of these levels is excited by the pulse and subject to the ensuing dynamics , giving rise to wavepackets @xmath46 which decay by spontaneous emission to ground state vibrational levels .",
    "the spontaneous decay of the excited state component of the @xmath47th wavepacket @xmath46 to the target level @xmath48 is determined by the temporally averaged overlap , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the excited state lifetime and @xmath51 is the projector onto the excited electronic state . shifting the time axis by @xmath52 , inserting the completeness relation for vibrational levels on the excited state and denoting the franck - condon factors @xmath53 by @xmath54 , eq .",

    "the integral is readily evaluated , yielding @xmath58 due to the timescale separation , @xmath59 is at most of the order @xmath60 , and the temporally averaged overlap is well approximated by the second term alone , @xmath61    the timescale separation also allows for neglecting the accidental creation of coherences in the ground state density matrix after each cooling cycle .",
    "while the initial ensemble most likely is a completely incoherent mixture , the state obtained on the ground electronic surface after one cooling cycle may contain coherences .",
    "accidentally , this could lead to accumulation of molecules in an undesired dark state , i.e. , a certain coherent superposition of vibrational eigenstates .",
    "however , the free evolution of the molecule introduces rapidly oscillating prefactors for each eigenstate .",
    "these oscillations are much more rapid than the time necessary for decay to the ground surface .",
    "therefore , the system will be in a superposition of eigenstates with a fixed modulus but random phase before the next pulse arrives . if necessary",
    ", this can be strictly enforced by introducing a small , randomized waiting period between cycles . since a dark state",
    "requires a fixed phase relation , accumulation in the dark state is effectively ruled out .    ignoring coherences , the initial ensemble for each pulse",
    "is described only in terms of the vibrational populations , and maximizing the excitation of each vibrational level corresponds to minimizing @xmath62 symmetric excitation of all levels is ensured by balancing the yield with respect to an arbitrarily chosen level out of the initial ensemble , @xmath63 , @xmath64 @xmath65 is required because otherwise the yield could be maximized by very efficiently exciting only some levels in the initial ensemble .",
    "this would result in incomplete cooling .",
    "in addition to efficiently exciting all vibrationally excited ground state levels , the target state must be kept dark .",
    "this is achieved by enforcing the steady - state condition , @xmath66 a further complication arises from the fact that molecules could dissociate during the cooling process .",
    "this is a source of loss and needs to be strictly prevented . the most efficient way of enforcing this requirement is to avoid leakage out of the initial ensemble of ground state vibrational levels , @xmath67 the first term in eq .   suppresses population transfer , via raman transitions , from the initial ground state ensemble into higher excited ground state levels , whereas the second term suppresses population of excited state levels that have large franck - condon factors with ground state levels outside of the initial ensemble .",
    "@xmath68 does not only counter dissociation of the molecules but also undesired heating .",
    "the complete final - time functional is given by the multi - objective target of keeping the target state dark , efficiently exciting all other vibrational levels in the initial ensemble and avoiding leakage out of the initial ensemble , @xmath69 where the @xmath70 allow to weight the separate contributions differently .",
    "the functional   will yield optimized pulses that cool when used in repeated excitation / deexcitation cycles , unless the molecule under consideration has a franck - condon map that strongly favors heating rather than cooling such that simultaneously fulfilling all targets imposed by the functional becomes very difficult .",
    "this raises the question of what is the minimum requirement on the transition matrix elements to obtain cooling .",
    "it has led us to define a second optimization functional .",
    "the main idea of this functional is to optimize population transfer to the electronically excited state only for a single ground state level @xmath71 .",
    "the excited state levels that are reached from @xmath71 need to have franck - condon factors that are favorable to cooling ( in the extreme case , a single excited state level with favorable franck - condon factor is sufficient ) .",
    "the population of all other vibrationally excited ground state levels is simply reshuffled via raman transitions , populating preferentially @xmath71 .",
    "for example , if the cooling target is the ground state and we choose @xmath72 , all higher levels are reshuffled into the next lower level , forming an assembly line which ends in @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding functional contains the steady state and leakage terms just as eq .  .",

    "@xmath87 is a polynomial of fourth order in the states , whereas @xmath88 is quadratic in the states .",

    "the linear version is sufficient , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 can be estimated analytically by evaluating a supremum over the second order derivatives of @xmath87 , and @xmath93 is a non - negative number .",
    "the analytical estimate of @xmath92 usually is much larger than the actual value of @xmath92 required to ensure monotonicity of the algorithm .",
    "since a large value of @xmath92 slows down convergence , it is much better to approximate @xmath92 numerically , using eq .",
    "( 25 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it turned out , however , that the non - convexity of @xmath94 is small in practice , and both the linear and the non - linear version of krotov s method behave very similarly .",
    "this can be rationalized by the fact that only one term in @xmath87 , @xmath65 , is non - convex and its impact on the convergence is small compared to that of the other terms in @xmath87 .",
    "the results presented below were all obtained for @xmath91 in eq .  .    instead of the square modulus in the overlaps of eqs .",
    ", , and , it is also possible to use the real part of the overlap  @xcite .",
    "this sets a global phase which is not neccessary but shows a better initial convergence for bad guess pulses .",
    "the latter is due to the specific form of the initial costates , @xmath95 , which remain constant for real part functionals while depending linearly on the final - time forward propagated states , @xmath96 , for the square modulus functional .",
    "hence real part functionals can not take values close to zero leading to very small gradients as is the case for square modulus functionals .",
    "this is important in particular for the assembly - line term , for which formulating a good guess pulse is difficult , and our results presented below were obtained with the real part instead of the square modulus in eq .  .",
    "we choose our guess pulses such as to avoid small gradients at the beginning of the optimization . in all examples ,",
    "they are taken to be gaussian transform - limited pulses of moderate intensity with central frequency and spectral width chosen to excite a number of transitions that are relevant for the cooling process .",
    "the latter are easily read off the franck - condon matrices in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcf ] .",
    "the choice of the @xmath97 is determined by the relative importance of the individual terms in the optimization functionals .",
    "a large value for the steady - state and leakage terms are impedient since a low value of these functionals will prevent a high repeatability of the excitation / deexcitation steps , effectively reducing the attainable yield .",
    "in contrast , a slightly lower yield for an individualy step can easily be amended by few additional cycles .",
    "consequently , as a rule of thumb , @xmath98 and @xmath99 should be chosen larger than @xmath100 and @xmath101 or @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "this is more important for the symmetrised cooling since in the assembly line case the leakage is much easier to prevent by virtue of the mechanism .",

    "a final value of @xmath108 ensures also for assembly - line cooling accumulation in the target state for 10000 cooling cycles .",

    "the integrated pulse energy amounts to @xmath126j . for @xmath106 , significantly more transitions need to be driven , cf .",

    "we have adapted optimal control theory for cooling internal degrees of freedom to account for the timescale separation between coherent excitation and spontaneous emission .",
    "our approach is based on a basis set expansion of the initial density matrix into vibrational eigenstates .",
    "this has allowed us to carry optimization of vibrational cooling from toy models  @xcite to a first principles description of alkali dimer molecules that are currently studied in cooling experiments  @xcite .",
    "compared to the earlier theoretical predictions where a single long pulse implemented the complete cooling process  @xcite , our approach allows for finding femtosecond pulses that can be repeatedly applied , just as is done in the experiments . shaping the pulses using optimal control allows to significantly reduce the number of excitation / spontaneous emission cycles and reach a high purity of the ground state molecules .",
    "more importantly , it also enables vibrational cooling for molecules where the franck - condon map favors heating rather than cooling .",
    "the derivation of our optimization functionals was based on two different intuitions .",
    "first , simultaneous , symmetric excitation of all ground state levels in the thermal ensemble to the excited state was expected to yield most efficient cooling .",
    "it turned out , however , that this approach has only a limited capability of suppressing leakage out of the initial ensemble to higher lying levels .",
    "in particular for molecules with unfavorable franck - condon map , this algorithm can not avoid vibrational heating and , in extreme cases , dissociation .",
    "we have therefore devised an optimization functional corresponding to assembly - line cooling where only one ground state level is transferred to the excited state while the population of all other vibrationally excited ground state levels is reshuffled via raman transitions . this approach yields pulses that enforce vibrational cooling even for molecules with transition matrix elements favoring heating rather than cooling .",
    "the spectral widths and integrated energies of our optimized pulses are well within the capabilities of current femtosecond technology .",
    "we have demonstrated successful implementation of cooling by calculating the population redistribution over a number of excitation / spontaneous emission steps , proving accumulation of ground state molecules .",
    "our study demonstrates the power of optimal control theory for reaching a control target that might not be accessible by simple , analytical pulse shapes .",
    "however , it also illustrates that optimal control theory is not a black - box tool but requires physical insight , in particular when constructing the optimization functional .",
    "this is crucial when one wants to address fundamental limits for control . in our case",
    ", this corresponds to the question of the minimum requirement on the molecular structure that is necessary to allow for cooling .",
    "the answer to this question determines the controllability of the problem , irrespective of the actual experimental resources such as pulse bandwidth or power .",
    "we find that all that is required is a single excited state level with moderate spontaneous decay probability to the target state and a limited number of significant transition matrix elements for the other ground state vibrational levels .",
    "laser cooling makes use of the simplest quantum reservoir , the vacuum of electric field modes , and has led to the concept of quantum reservoir engineering  @xcite .",
    "analogously , our optimization approach for laser cooling can be generalized to quantum reservoir engineering . since the creation of coherences",
    "can not be neglected in the general case , this requires a basis set expansion in liouville space rather than hilbert space .",
