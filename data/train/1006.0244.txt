    "the primordial helium abundance , @xmath6 , can be determined to a high accuracy thanks to the measurement of cosmological parameters , particularly of the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath7 , by wmap @xcite .",
    "the most recent wmap results @xcite give @xmath8 ( using the analytic formula presented by @xcite relating @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , but rely on the assumption of standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) . on the other hand , empirical determinations of @xmath6 , that can be used to test the sbbn scenario , rely on the determination of helium abundances in metal poor hii regions and extrapolations to zero metalicity , assuming a linear relation between helium and metalicity ( or oxygen ) with a given slope @xmath9 ( see @xcite for a detailed account of the method and uncertainties involved ) .",
    "the results are not exempt of controversy .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath10 , in excellent agreement with wmap+sbbn results , while other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , find higher values , @xmath11 , and suggest deviations from sbbn .",
    "discrepancies are not confined to @xmath6 , but are also found in the given values of @xmath12 .",
    "other attempts to determine @xmath9 , both observationally and theoretically , include the use of the broadening of the lower main sequence ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for recent works ) , the study of galactic stellar populations @xcite , modeling eclipsing binaries @xcite , construction of galactic chemical evolution models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath9 range approximately between 1.4 and 2.5 for different authors and methods .",
    "the initial composition of stars determines their structure and evolution and , by extension , the characteristics of stellar populations .",
    "the initial helium abundance of stars is in most cases impossible to determine directly , hence indirect methods have to be used .",
    "a common approach used in stellar and stellar populations modeling is to assume a value for @xmath9 and use the solar helium and metalicity as an anchor point for the relation .",
    "this is a routine procedure used in , for example , libraries of stellar evolutionary tracks to define the initial composition used in the stellar models ( e.g. , @xcite ) the initial solar helium abundance , however , can not be determined directly .",
    "it is well established that element diffusion takes place in the sun and that the present - day photospheric abundances of helium and metals are lower than the initial ones .",
    "therefore , the initial solar helium abundance is usually obtained from calibrating solar models , which then introduces model dependencies on the determined values .",
    "an illustrative example is the effect of solar photospheric metalicity determinations on the inferred initial solar helium abundance .",
    "solar models that use older solar abundances like those of @xcite or @xcite lead to models with initial helium values in the models in the range @xmath13 @xcite , while models that incorporate newer determinations of solar metalicity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) give @xmath14 @xcite . while the models with the older abundances have present - day surface helium abundances @xmath1 consistent with helioseismic determinations of the helioseismology determinations of the present - day solar convection - zone helium abundance , the models with the lower metal abundances do not .",
    "it is interesting to note also that if we adopt @xmath14 values together with initial solar metalicities derived from the same solar models , i.e. @xmath15 , then values as low as 0.8 are obtained for @xmath9 ( assuming @xmath16 from sbbn ) .",
    "this is in disagreement with all accepted determinations of @xmath9 as we have summarized above .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a simple method to determine the initial solar helium abundance based on the use of solar models to calibrate the relation between the initial and the present - day surface helium abundances .",
    "although derived with the help of solar models , we then show that the predicted initial solar helium abundance ( @xmath3 ; not to be confused by the initial helium abundance @xmath0 resulting from solar model calibrations ) is a robust result , i.e. a very wide range of solar models ( standard and non - standard ) lead to the same @xmath3 value .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in   [ sec : powerlaws ] we determine the effect of changes in the input parameters used in solar models ( including metal abundances , diffusion rate , nuclear cross sections , etc . ) on the initial and present - day helium abundances of the solar models ; in   [ sec : correl ] we derive a simple analytic relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 that minimizes the uncertainties originating in the inputs to solar model calculations ; in   [ sec : results ] we present our main results and discuss their range of applicability ; finally , we summarize our findings and conclusions in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "for this paper , we use the same technique that has been used earlier for analyzing neutrino fluxes ( * ? ? ? * see chap.7 ) .",
    "we express the dependence of the initial ( @xmath0 ) and present - day ( @xmath1 ) helium abundances of solar models as a product of powers of the different input parameters :    @xmath17    @xmath18    in these equations , the input parameters in solar models ( nuclear cross sections , abundances of individual elements , age , etc . )",
    "are represented by a set of parameters @xmath19 with central , or reference , values denoted with the sub - index `` 0 '' .",
    "these parameters comprise : metal abundances , nuclear reaction rates , element diffusion rate , solar surface parameters ( luminosity , age ) ; a detailed list is given in table  [ tab : pwl ] .",
    "the exponents @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively determine the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the input parameters . they are defined as @xmath22    the indices in equations  ( [ eq : index ] ) were calculated for standard solar models ( ssm ) using different determinations of photospheric solar composition .",
    "we chose the compilations by @xcite and @xcite , hereafter gs98 and ags05 respectively , and _ conservative uncertainties _ , according to the definition by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bsb06 ) . a discussion of the central values for all parameters , as well as their uncertainties , is presented in that work . to derive the indices we proceeded as follows : for each input parameter @xmath23 we computed a set of 50 ssms where the value of @xmath23 is drawn from a gaussian distribution , with standard deviation equal to the assumed uncertainty of the parameter , while all other input parameters are kept fixed and equal to their central value .",
    "the logarithmic derivatives defined in equations  [ eq : index ] are then obtained from fits to each of the small monte carlo simulations described above .",
    "some examples are shown in figure  [ fig : fits ] .",
    "the values of these dependencies are tabulated in table  [ tab : pwl ] .",
    "the exponents derived for both gs98 and ags05 solar models are similar .",
    "this is so because relative changes in input parameters produce relative changes in solar model properties that do not , to the first order , depend on the reference solar model . even more important for this work",
    "is that the ratios @xmath24 are almost independent of the reference solar models used .",
    "differences in the values obtained for gs98 and ags05 models will be used later as a way to determine the systematic uncertainty of the method presented in this work .",
    "radiative opacities can not be represented by a single parameter . hence to account for the influence of opacities on @xmath0 and @xmath1 we have proceeded in the following way : for both ags05 and gs98 compositions we have computed two solar models , one with opal opacities and the other one with op opacities , while keeping all other input physics the same in both models . for each composition we define the @xmath25 uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath1 as half the difference in the values obtained for models with the same composition but the two different opacity sources .",
    "we find that for @xmath1 the uncertainty from opacity is 0.23%(0.20% ) , while for @xmath0 is 0.30%(0.28% ) for the ags05(gs98 ) composition .",
    "the uncertainties between @xmath0 and @xmath1 are found to be fully correlated .",
    "we account for opacity uncertainties by adding gaussian dispersions with the above defined standard deviations to the distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 that we generate using equations  [ eq : yini ]  and  [ eq : ys ] .",
    "we have verified that equations  [ eq : yini ]  and  [ eq : ys ] describe the behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in solar models very well by comparing distributions generated with these equations against results obtained with full solar models . in particular , we have used the large set of solar models computed for the monte carlo simulation done by bsb06 , where different assumptions for the reference solar composition and abundance uncertainties were adopted .",
    "results of the comparison are presented in figure  [ fig : ys - yini ] .",
    "the panel on the left shows results for the gs98 composition with conservative ( large ) abundance uncertainties ( see bsb06 for details ) ; while the panel on the right shows results for models using ags05 composition and much smaller uncertainties , as originally given by ags05 . in both cases ,",
    "results from the full solar models obtained from the bsb06 monte carlo simulations and the resulting distributions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 obtained by means of equations  [ eq : yini ]  and  [ eq : ys ] are shown .",
    "we see in both cases that results from full solar models are reproduced very closely by the power - law expressions .",
    "having verified the validity of power - law expressions in reproducing the correct distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in what follows , we concentrate on using these expressions to constrain the solar initial abundance , @xmath3 , in a model independent manner .",
    "we do this by using the helioseismically determined solar convection - zone helium abundance .",
    "in this paper we assume , unless specified otherwise , that only microscopic diffusion of helium and heavy elements modify the composition of the outer layers of the sun . therefore , in the absence of diffusion , @xmath1 would exactly match @xmath0 .",
    "the most evident effect of diffusion , through gravitational settling , is to decrease @xmath1 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "thus @xmath1 and the diffusion rate are anticorrelated . diffusion also modifies the composition in the solar core .",
    "in particular , gravitational settling of metals in the core leads to a higher radiative opacity and hence , to a steeper temperature profile .",
    "the slightly increased temperature in turn increases the rates of nuclear energy production .",
    "however , the solar luminosity is fixed .",
    "thus , the increase in energy production due to the larger temperatures has to be compensated by decreasing the amount of available hydrogen or , equivalently , by increasing the helium abundance in the core . as a consequence , @xmath0",
    "is positively correlated with the diffusion rate .",
    "we call these two combined effects , the negative correlation of @xmath1 the the positive correlation of @xmath0 with the diffusion rate , the ` direct influence ' of diffusion .",
    "as can be seen from the coefficients listed in table  [ tab : pwl ] , the direct influence of diffusion is the only effect that modify @xmath1 and @xmath0 in opposite ways . for this reason , in what follows we treat the effect of diffusion separately . thus equations .",
    "[ eq : yini ]  and  [ eq : ys ] are modified to :    @xmath26 \\label{eq : yi_2}\\ ] ]    @xmath27 \\label{eq : ys_2}\\ ] ]    using the expressions in brackets in the equations above , we obtained distributions for @xmath1 and @xmath0 that exclude the direct effect of diffusion .",
    "the correlation between these two quantities is now very tight as can be seen in figure  [ fig : nodiff ] .",
    "naively , we would expect no dispersion to be present , since the diffusion rates are kept fixed .",
    "however , keeping the diffusion rates fixed does not imply the total amount of helium ( and metals ) diffused out of the convective envelope is constant . the effective rate of diffusion in the solar envelope is directly related to the extension of the convective envelope which acts as a reservoir of helium .",
    "therefore , any changes to the model inputs that have an effect on the mass contained in the convective envelope will be reflected in a deviation of the behavior of @xmath1 with respect to that of @xmath0 ( i.e. , effectively changing the values of the power - law exponents @xmath20 and @xmath21 to a small extent ) , leading to the dispersion seen in figure  [ fig : nodiff ] .    following a procedure analogous to that used by @xcite to study solar neutrino fluxes , we take advantage of the small dispersion in the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 to express the uncertainties in @xmath0 in terms of those in @xmath1 while minimizing the uncertainty in all parameters except for diffusion . to do this",
    "we combine equations  [ eq : yi_2 ] and  [ eq : ys_2 ] to obtain : @xmath28 where @xmath29 the constant @xmath30 is obtained by doing a linear fit to the simulated data for @xmath31 and @xmath32 using the power - law expressions while ignoring the direct dependence on diffusion . for the gs98-c case",
    "we obtain @xmath33 .",
    "the residuals of the fit have a dispersion of 0.4% ( left panels of figure  [ fig : nodiff ] ) . for the exponent in the diffusion factor",
    "we obtain @xmath34 .",
    "we can now write @xmath35 ,   \\label{eq : first_res}\\ ] ] where the uncertainty of 0.4% represents the total uncertainty due to all non - diffusion parameters ( note that only abundance - uncertainties play an appreciable role ) .",
    "if we used optimistic abundance - uncertainties instead , the total non - diffusion uncertainty would be only 0.2% .    to proceed further",
    ", we need to consider the uncertainty of the diffusion rate ( hereafter @xmath36 ) . the best agreement between the structure of solar models and the helioseismically determined solar structure",
    "is obtained when helium and heavy - element diffusion is included in the models @xcite .",
    "however , the actual diffusion rates of helium and metals and , in particular , the associated uncertainties are not well constrained . @xcite",
    "have estimated an uncertainty of about 15% in the diffusion rates .",
    "a similar result was obtained by @xcite by using conditions at the base of the convective zone to constrain the diffusion rates .",
    "a detailed study by @xcite shows that diffusion velocities depend on the different assumptions made in the calculation for different elements and , at different regions of the sun , the variation ranges from a few percent to about 40% . here",
    ", we adopt an intermediate fiducial value @xmath37 as the uncertainty in the diffusion rates .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainty in @xmath0 because of uncertainties in the diffusion rate are only one - twelfth that of uncertainties in the diffusion rate .",
    "then , for @xmath37 , the contribution of diffusion to the total uncertainty in @xmath0 is only 1.7% .",
    "thus , @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{eq : final1}\\ ] ]    we now scale the relation to the sun by adopting the present - day surface helium abundance determined using helioseismology .",
    "we adopt the value determined by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath39 , where the uncertainty accounts for systematics , including those caused by uncertainties in the equation of state ( see @xcite for a recent discussion about the determination of @xmath40 ) .",
    "then , the solar initial helium abundance @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{eq : final}\\ ] ] in the above expression , standard solar models ( ssms ) play a two - folded role .",
    "first , a reference model is used to get the scaling factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "second , models are used to determine the exponent that relate @xmath40 and @xmath43 . however , as we show in the following section , equation  [ eq : final ] has predictive power independent of the ( standard ) solar model used as a reference .",
    "as a first test of equation  [ eq : final ] , we use values @xmath44and @xmath45 obtained from ssm calculations of @xcite . the results are summarized in table  [ tab : results ] where we have identified the solar models by the solar composition adopted for each of them .",
    "the second and third columns give the ssm predictions for the initial and present - day surface helium mass fraction .",
    "the fourth column gives the @xmath3 values estimated using equation  [ eq : final ] ; the uncertainty in all cases is @xmath46 . comparing results for the different standard solar models we find that the dispersion in @xmath3 is about ten times smaller than @xmath47 and",
    "hence we conclude that the estimated values of @xmath3 are consistent with each other , and they are independent of the standard solar model used as reference .",
    "if standard solar models based on ags05 composition are used to derive the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we get @xmath48 instead of 0.836 .",
    "we have used gs98 and ags05 for this comparison in an attempt to bracket what the real solar abundance probably is .",
    "these two compilations represent the two ends of the currently accepted range of values for solar photospheric abundances .",
    "therefore , we also expect that our estimates of @xmath30 for the gs98-c and ags05-op cases represent the two extremes of the possible range of values for this quantity .",
    "replacing @xmath49 in eq .",
    "[ eq : final ] and again using the standard solar models from @xcite , we get the @xmath3 values listed in the last column of table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath3 results obtained with the two values of @xmath50 for each ssm shows that the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath50 has a very minor effect in the predicted @xmath3 values .",
    "the largest difference is found for the agss09ph model , for which @xmath51 , a factor of @xmath52 smaller than @xmath47 estimated above .",
    "we have shown that the predicted @xmath3 values have a very small dependence on the solar model used to determine it .",
    "the choice of standard solar models for deriving the exponent @xmath30 also introduces a small scatter in the resulting @xmath3 values .",
    "therefore , we average all values @xmath3 presented in table  [ tab : results ] to determine the final result and also use the scatter to define the systematic uncertainty of the method .",
    "the final result that we obtain is @xmath53 where the first part of the uncertainty includes contributions from helioseismology and solar input parameters , and the second one is the systematic uncertainty of the method as defined above .",
    "we have tested the robustness of this result by applying equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) to a variety of solar models , standard and non - standard , i.e. including additional physics not considered in ssms .",
    "as a first consistency check , we have applied equation  [ eq : final ] to the two large sets of ssms computed by bsb06 used to assess the validity of the power - law expansions obtained in   [ sec : powerlaws ] .",
    "averaging all results for the ags05-op monte carlo set presented in bsb06 , we find @xmath54 and for the gs98-cons set we get @xmath55 , i.e. results fully consistent with the basic derivation of @xmath3 and its uncertainty based on the four ssms presented in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "these uncertainties do not include errors in the helioseismic results .    to further test the robustness of our derivation of @xmath3 we have resorted to results for standard and non - standard solar models from the literature .",
    "non - standard models have been considered only when the modification to the input physics results in a model that is in better agreement with helioseismic results than its ssm counterpart . as a last test ,",
    "we have computed additional non - standard models to test the influence of turbulent diffusion on the robustness of our predictions .    here is a summary of our observations :    *",
    "@xcite have tested the effect of different diffusion schemes ( including radiative levitation in some cases ) and the use of monochromatic opacities . by applying equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) to their models that include diffusion ,",
    "we obtain an average @xmath56 , where the uncertainty refers to the scatter between models . from all their models",
    "we infer @xmath3 consistent within @xmath25 of our result in equation  [ eq : res1 ] . *",
    "some standard and non - standard models have been presented in @xcite . from these models",
    "( except their models with no diffusion and with a mixed core ; both clearly ruled out by helioseismology ) we determine an average value @xmath57 ( scatter between models ) .",
    "the model that most deviates from this results includes rotation which , by introducing additional mixing , tends to inhibit the efficiency of diffusion . for this particular model",
    "we get @xmath58 , still within @xmath25 of the predicted value in equation  [ eq : res1 ] . * @xcite have computed a large set of different solar models with different variations in the input physics and parameters . for all these models we derive @xmath59 consistent within @xmath25 of the central result shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : res1 ] .",
    "the only exception is their model where the diffusion velocity of helium is increased by 20% , for which we derive @xmath60 , a @xmath61 difference with our derived central value for @xmath40 ; but this model shows a convective envelope too shallow compared to the helioseismic value , and hence , we do not consider the discrepancy to be important . averaging all results , we get @xmath62 .",

    "eliminates the bump in the sound - speed difference between models and the sun below the convective envelope .",
    "we computed models for @xmath68 with both gs98 and ags05 compositions . applying equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) to these models , we find @xmath69 for increasing @xmath66 and irrespective of the composition adopted .",
    "it should be noted that all models with turbulent diffusion predict sound - speed profiles with average root - mean - square deviations from helioseimic results that are comparable to the rms deviations of ssms .",
    "in fact , for models based on the gs98 composition we get an average rms sound speed deviation of 0.0009 for the ssm while for models with @xmath68 we get 0.0009 , 0.0009 , and 0.0010 respectively . for models based on the ags05 composition ,",
    "results are 0.0047 , 0.0053 , 0.0054 , and 0.0055 for the ssm and models with increasing @xmath66 as given above .",
    "this is a result of the fact that , although for models with turbulent diffusion the bump below the cz disappears , the lower central helium abundance in the models lead to a slight worsening of the agreement with the solar sound speed towards the center .",
    "this is also reflected in the frequency separation ratios , particularly @xmath70 @xcite , which in all three cases show worse agreement with the observed solar @xmath70 than the corresponding ssm constructed with the same composition .",
    "larger effects in this direction are found for increasing @xmath66 values . from these results , we conclude that non - ssms accounting for the effect of extra mixing lead to the prediction : @xmath71 consistent with the result from ssms given in [ eq : res2 ] .",
    "we have used standard solar models to study the dependence of the initial ( @xmath0 ) and surface ( @xmath1 ) helium abundances on different input physics and element abundances entering solar model calculations . as expected",
    ", there is a very tight correlation between these two quantities , particularly if direct effects of diffusion are not taken into account .",
    "we have used this tight correlation to express the initial solar helium abundance ( @xmath3 ; not to be confused with the initial value predicted by models ) as a function of the solar surface helium abundance , @xmath40 , determined from helioseismology , while minimizing the uncertainties from solar model input parameters .",
    "this result is expressed in a compact form in equation  [ eq : final ] . a slightly more general expression where the scaling of the helium and metals diffusion rate is still explicit",
    "is given in equation  [ eq : first_res ] .",
    "we have applied equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) to different , recently published standard solar models listed in table  [ tab : results ] , and derive @xmath72 ( equation  [ eq : res1 ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the diffusion rate of elements and those in the helioseismic determination of the solar surface helium abundance .",
    "the dispersion in the results for the different solar models is one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the results are also robust in terms of the standard solar models used to derive equation  [ eq : final ] .    to test further the robustness of our results , we have compiled results from literature for standard and non - standard solar models ( though only those non - standard solar models that improve agreement with helioseismic inferences of solar structure ) . in all cases , even for the non - standard ones , applying equation  [ eq : final ] to results from solar models yield @xmath3 results consistent to within @xmath25 of our central value of @xmath72 .",
    "finally , we have also computed solar models including turbulent diffusion as a phenomenological approach to eliminate the bump in the sound - speed difference between models and the sun that is seen below the convective envelope . for these models",
    ", a small value of the free parameter @xmath66 , @xmath73 , leads to @xmath74 , consistent within @xmath25 with our prediction given in equation  [ eq : res1 ] .",
    "larger values of @xmath66 predict systematically lower values for @xmath3 but lead to slightly degraded agreement with helioseismology , as evinced by frequency separation ratios ( probably a result of the lower central helium abundance predicted by these models ) .",
    "thus , we find no evidence , at least from helioseismology data , that support the need of larger @xmath66 values .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that this formulation of turbulent diffusion represents only a phenomenological approach to eliminating the bump in the sound - speed difference profile .",
    "more realistic models that account for rotationally - induced mixing , like that one derived by @xcite , lead again to @xmath74 .",
    "we conclude that the initial solar helium abundance , as inferred from the present - day solar surface helium abundance determined by helioseismology , is @xmath75 .",
    "although solar models are used to reach this conclusion , we find this result is almost independent of which solar models are used in its derivation . if @xmath3 is determined from non - standard solar models that account for the effects of extra mixing , we obtain @xmath76 . in all cases ,",
