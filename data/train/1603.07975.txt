    "in the first realizations of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the laboratory @xcite and in many experiments ever since , the bose gas is trapped in a potential that can be considered as parabolic to a very good approximation . in the thermodynamic limit , within the ideal gas approximation , the critical temperature for such a system is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the geometric mean of the trap frequencies and all the other symbols have their usual meaning ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "soon after the first experiments , corrections to this expression , @xmath2 , were found . on the one hand , experiments do not take place in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence , finite - size corrections are required . on the other hand ,",
    "the gases are not ideal , having a non - vanishing scattering length .",
    "hence , interaction effects must be taken into account .",
    "the first order shift @xmath3 due to interactions was determined analytically early on in @xcite within a mean - field approximation , in the form of a linear term in the scattering length .",
    "higher order corrections followed in several works @xcite , both numerical and analytical .",
    "expansions for @xmath3 in powers of the scattering length down to second order were determined , both within a mean - field approach @xcite and accounting for critical correlations @xcite .    the first order finite - size induced shift was given in the isotropic case in @xcite and in the general anisotropic case in @xcite as @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "more recently , a higher order result was given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result relies on the local density approximation , in which the discrete energy levels of the finite system are approximated by a continuum , therefore requiring that the typical thermal energy at the transition be much greater than the typical inter - level spacing ( for example , in the case of an isotropic harmonic trap , @xmath6 ) , i.e. , the thermodynamic limit .",
    "moreover , in order to overcome the vagueness ( or non - point - like character ) associated with the critical temperature of the finite system , we believe it would be useful to consider an explicit physical criterion for this critical temperature , related for example to the condensate fraction or the specific heat , when going to the level of detail of higher - order corrections @xcite .    strictly speaking , a finite - size correction to @xmath7 is an ill - defined concept when taken on its own because the effect of finite size is to spread out the phase transition from a point to a narrow temperature interval .",
    "the first order correction ( [ classic ] ) is typically extracted from a high temperature finite - size expansion of the number of particles , which takes into due account the discreteness of the energy levels and which can be obtained in several ways @xcite .",
    "if one attempts to find a second order correction from this expansion , the absence of a true critical temperature makes itself noticed : the next order term in the expansion is divergent at the critical point , ultimately implying the non - existence of bec as a sharp , mathematically defined phase transition in finite systems .",
    "it follows that the first order corrected @xmath8 must not be taken too seriously .",
    "it merely provides a reference value for signaling the transition .    in experimental work where the bec critical temperature is measured @xcite , the expression generally quoted for purposes of comparison with theory , namely for splitting off finite - size effects from interaction effects ,",
    "is the one in ( [ classic ] ) .",
    "now , as mentioned above , this expression should not be taken at face value .",
    "thus , there is the possibility that a misinterpretation of the finite - size related shift can lead to a bias in the reported values of the interaction induced shift .",
    "it would be of interest to make this matter clearer .",
    "what is actually measured in experiments is the number of particles , ground state fraction , trap frequencies and temperature .",
    "it is by performing some polynomial fit to a plot involving these quantities that an experimental value for @xmath8 is usually extracted @xcite . in the landmark experiment reported in @xcite",
    "the fit is performed in the region where the condensate fraction `` noticeably starts to increase '' .",
    "condensate fractions as low as about @xmath9 could be measured in this experiment .",
    "if lower condensate fractions could be measured , higher critical temperatures would have been obtained , even rising above @xmath7 for sufficiently small condensate fractions .",
    "this is because for finite systems the condensate fraction is not zero for temperatures above the critical region .",
    "it is just very small .",
    "this fact becomes more conspicuous for low particle numbers .",
    "another major experiment in what concerns high precision measurements of @xmath8 is reported in @xcite . here , very much the same comments apply . in this case ,",
    "condensate fractions as low as @xmath10 could be detected .",
    "the authors overcome the problem of isolating interaction from finite - size corrections by performing differential measurements with reference to a standard value of the scattering length .",
    "nevertheless , as recently pointed out @xcite , this assumes that finite size and interaction effects are independent . at second order",
    ", it might not be the case .",
    "our aim in the present work is to obtain higher - order finite - size corrections to the critical temperature of a bose gas in a general harmonic trap . to do this in a meaningful way , which at the same time can connect to experimental procedures",
    ", we overcome the non - existence of a true critical temperature by asking instead for the temperature @xmath11 at which the condensate fraction has a given small value @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "other criteria could be used , like defining @xmath8 by the maximum of the specific heat or the inflection point of the @xmath14 curve ; but the one we adopt here is probably the most useful because it uses the condensate fraction and it is very simple . from the well known bulk behaviour of the condensate fraction in the bec regime , @xmath15",
    ", we have in the thermodynamic limit @xmath16 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "this yields @xmath18",
    ". we will provide finite - size corrections to @xmath11 down to third order .",
    "stopping at second order is not accurate enough in some circumstances , as detailed below .",
    "our approach preserves all the finite - size characteristics of the system , with no approximations involved .",
    "the information on the discrete structure of the energy levels is carried in the expansions ( [ condfraction ] ) and ( [ t_k ] ) below .",
    "finally , we note that our expressions are also valid ( and highly accurate ) for @xmath19 not small , i.e. , deep into the bec regime .",

    "@xmath22 and eventually @xmath42 will be our expansion parameters . in the bec regime , we have in addition ( still in the thermodynamic limit ) @xmath43 , from where we see that @xmath23 scales as @xmath44 .",
    "what we need is an expansion for @xmath25 that contains the finite - size corrections and that is valid _ throughout _ the critical region .",
    "this can be achieved by applying a mellin - barnes transform to the exponential inside the @xmath45 summation in ( [ nnew ] ) , as indeed was done before in @xcite .",
    "the same procedure was also applied to a bose gas subject to other confinements @xcite .",
    "an expansion is obtained by solving a contour integral in the complex plane using the theorem of residues . in this case , the riemann and three - dimensional barnes zeta functions , here denoted @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , make their appearance .",
    "knowledge of the residues at the poles of these functions is required .",

    "the expansion for @xmath25 was calculated to subleading order . however , for our purposes we need also the third and fourth terms .",
    "the calculation of the third term , in particular , is more involved due to the existence of a double pole , requiring the knowledge of the finite part at the @xmath49 pole of @xmath47 , not only its residue .",
    "specifically , below we need the quantity @xmath50 defined in the following way .",

    ", the value of @xmath85 can not be chosen too small .",
    "this is because in this situation we will have @xmath110 due to the spreading out of the phase transition , while we require @xmath111 .",
    "this can also be seen by looking at the coefficient of the @xmath94 term in ( [ t_k ] ) , @xmath84 .",
    "it contains a term with factor @xmath112 which becomes large if @xmath85 is very small .",
    "in fact , if we carry on with the expansion , it is seen that at every third term a new factor @xmath112 will appear .",
    "thus , the terms in @xmath94 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 contain the factor @xmath112 , the terms in @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 contain the factor @xmath118 and so on .",
    "it follows that this expansion is valid only if @xmath119 , or equivalently , @xmath120 .",
    "this is a very reasonable condition .",
    "it corresponds exactly to temperatures very close to @xmath7 or below it , confirming in this way the original requirement @xmath111 for the validity of the expansion .",
    "if @xmath121 just holds but the tighter condition @xmath122 ( equivalently , @xmath123 ) does not , then the expansion is valid but the term in @xmath94 is of the same order as the @xmath42 term ( while the terms in @xmath124 , @xmath125 , will be of smaller order ) .",
    "hence , it is very important to include it .",
    "this limiting situation happens for example for @xmath126 and @xmath127 or for @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "all this is very well corroborated by comparing with numerical results as can be seen in the figure . for medium to large @xmath25 ,",
    "the analytical and numerical curves are superimposed or hardly distinguishable , due to the high accuracy of ( [ t_k ] ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath130 and @xmath108 or @xmath131 and @xmath109 the error in @xmath81 from ( [ t_k ] ) is less than @xmath132 ( in the isotropic case ) .",
    "as we lower @xmath25 , the accuracy slowly decreases . as expected",
    ", this happens more quickly for @xmath109 .",
    "the broadening of the phase transition is observed in the rise of @xmath107 for low @xmath25 .",
    "our approximation captures this behaviour . for comparison , we plot the usual first order result , given by eq .",
    "( [ classic ] ) .",
    "we see it provides a useful reference value for the transition for @xmath133 , even though it does not have a precise meaning . for lower values of @xmath25 ,",
    "the new corrections are particularly important .",
    "roughly , in most situations , the new corrections should be important for @xmath134 .",
    "in such cases , if the interaction strength is small , it is quite possible that these effects become of the same order or even dominant over the interaction effects .",
    "we plot @xmath81 for @xmath135 and axially symmetric disc shaped and cigar shaped traps .",
    "@xmath81 is plotted as a function of the aspect ratio @xmath136 . for both shapes ,",
    "the anisotropy causes a decrease in @xmath81 .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the disc shape , which can be understood from the fact that the dependency of @xmath137 ( and hence of @xmath42 ) on the aspect ratio @xmath136 is stronger in the disc case .",
    "the effect seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotropic ] where @xmath81 rises above @xmath105 for low @xmath25 is not seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropic ] because anisotropy lowers the critical temperature without spreading out the phase transition , which remains sharp .",
    "it can also be seen that the accuracy of ( [ t_k ] ) slightly decreases with increasing anisotropy .",
    "this is expected and is due to the fact that @xmath137 decreases with increasing @xmath136 , which causes @xmath42 to increase . naturally , this is more noticeable for @xmath129 .",
    "it is also more noticeable in the cigar shape case .",
    "this should be due to the exact nature of the higher order terms ( @xmath113 and higher ) left out of our expansion ( [ t_k ] ) .",
    "all in all , it can be seen that ( [ t_k ] ) is still quite accurate in most anisotropic situations ( the exception being the highly anisotropic cigar shaped trap with very small @xmath85 ) . as in the isotropic case ,",
    "higher values of @xmath25 lead to higher accuracy .",
    "we also plot the first order result from ( [ classic ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropic ] .",
    "again , we see that for this number of particles , eq .  ( [ classic ] ) works well for providing a reference value for the transition .",
    "let us now take the experimental conditions of smith _ et al _ @xcite : @xmath138 and a nearly isotropic trap .",
    "condensate fractions as low as @xmath139 could reliably be measured in this experiment . for @xmath135 and @xmath109",
    "we have @xmath140 from numerical calculations .",
    "( [ t_k ] ) yields @xmath141 whereas the result from ( [ classic ] ) yields @xmath142 , which is lower than @xmath81 by @xmath143 of @xmath7 . in gerbier _",

    "yields @xmath149 , which is higher than @xmath107 by @xmath9 of @xmath7 . for @xmath150",
    "this difference reduces to @xmath151 of @xmath7 .",
    "if the trap had a larger anisotropy , the difference would be larger . in order to obtain the shift @xmath3 due to interactions",
    ", the authors in @xcite subtracted the finite - size correction as given in ( [ classic ] ) from their experimental values for @xmath8 .",
    "if the authors had used the lowest reliably detected condensate fraction ( @xmath146 ) for defining an experimental critical temperature , the finite - size shift that should be subtracted would be @xmath152 and not the one given in ( [ classic ] ) .",
    "however , the procedure for obtaining this temperature was actually more complex than that , involving linear fits to the plots of @xmath153 , @xmath25 and @xmath154 as functions of the trap depth . the main feature of this idea can perhaps be understood by thinking of a linear fit applied to the experimental points near the @xmath108 region of the familiar @xmath155 curve . in this simplified version , the experimental @xmath8",
    "would then be given by the point of intersection of the straight line of the linear fit with the horizontal ( @xmath154 ) axes .",
    "due to the complexity of the whole procedure , it is not clear exactly what finite - size correction should be subtracted .",
    "nevertheless , we see that an error of the order of 1% of @xmath7 ( not more ) could be involved in the determination of the interaction induced @xmath3 due to the use of eq .",
    "( [ classic ] ) instead of a more precise expression .",
    ", an accuracy of about @xmath151 or less in the reported values of @xmath63 should suffice .",
    "this requirement seems to be quite realistic and , in particular , it seems to hold in the experiment of @xcite . ]",
    "these examples illustrate the relevance of accurate analytical finite - size corrections , while suggesting the usefulness of better defined criteria for measuring the critical temperature , whenever finite - size effects play a role . in particular , in such cases it would seem to us perhaps more relevant to talk about @xmath107 , the temperature at which the condensate fraction is @xmath19 , rather than _ the _ critical temperature . for lower particle numbers ,",
    "these considerations are even more important , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotropic ] .    on another note",
    ", the use of bec experiments to probe planck - scale physics has been suggested in the last few years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "finite - size effects would be crucial in such an experiment . in this context",
    ", the need has been recognized @xcite for higher order finite - size corrections .",
    "we have given these corrections in the present work .",
    "this work took as a starting point a certain criterion for the bec critical temperature of a finite system .",
    "as mentioned above , other physical criteria could be adopted . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to apply the techniques of the present work to these alternative criteria .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to study analytically the interplay between finite size and interaction effects .",
    "it would not be surprising if there is a second order correction cross term containing a dependency on both the finite size and the interaction strength .",
