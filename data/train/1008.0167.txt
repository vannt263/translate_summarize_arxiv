    "within the method of qcd sum rules ,  la shifman  vainshtein  zakharov , the concept of quark  hadron duality is usually implemented by _ assuming _ that above specific continuum thresholds the contributions to suitably defined correlators of interpolating currents at the level of the qcd degrees of freedom equal those at the level of the hadronic bound states .",
    "our approach @xcite seeks to quantify the uncertainty induced by such an _ approximation _ and to improve the accuracy of all predictions by allowing our threshold to depend on the involved momenta and parameters introduced upon application of borel transformations . the borel transformation to a new variable , the borel parameter ( called @xmath0 or @xmath1 hereafter ) , serves to _ remove _ subtraction terms and _ suppress _ excitation and continuum contributions .",
    "any such idea is best tested first in a situation in which the outcome for all bound - state characteristics one is interested in is known exactly .",
    "so let s study a quantum - mechanical model defined by a nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath2 with a harmonic - oscillator interaction : @xmath3this model is _ exactly _ solvable : ground - state energy , decay constant , and form factor read@xmath4we inspect the analogues of a few @xmath5-point correlation functions of interpolating currents . the borelized polarization function or 2-point vacuum ",
