    "during the last twenty years , models with @xmath1 symmetry which are relevant to antiferromagnets have drawn a lot of attention .",
    "in particular spin-1/2 heisenberg - type models have been studied in great detail both analytically and numerically because it is believed that these models are the correct models to describe the undoped precursors of high @xmath13 cuprates ( undoped antiferromagnets ) . beside their phenomenological importance , these @xmath1 models for antiferromagnets are interesting from theoretical perspective as well .",
    "further , because of the availability of efficient monte carlo algorithms and increasing computing power , the physics of these models has been investigated with unprecedented numerical accuracy @xcite .",
    "for instance , using a loop algorithm as well as finite - volume and -temperature predictions from magnon chiral perturbation theory , the corresponding low - energy constants , namely the staggered magnetization density @xmath14 , the spin stiffness @xmath15 and the spin - wave velocity @xmath0 of spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the square lattices are determined with high accuracy and are in agreement with experimental results @xcite . because the properties of these models with @xmath1 symmetry are well - studied ,",
    "they are particular suitable for exploring any new idea .    in analogy to chiral perturbation theory for the pions in qcd , a systematic low - energy effective field theory for the magnons in an antiferromagnet",
    "exists as well and is called magnon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "low - energy effective field theories are based on symmetry constraints of the underlying models and are universally applicable .",
    "results obtained by effective field theories are exact , order by order in a systematic low - energy expansion .",
    "material specific properties enter the effective lagrangian in the form of a priori undetermined low - energy parameters , like the spin stiffness @xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) or the spin - wave velocity @xmath0 .",
    "once the numerical values of these low - energy constants are determined , either by monte carlo simulations or experimental data , the low - energy physics of the underlying models are completely determined . since the low - energy physics of the underlying model only depends on the corresponding low - energy constants , it is important to determine these low - energy constants as precise as possible . from theoretical perspective , to determine the numerical values of these low - energy constants are important as well . for instance , by simulating spin-1/2 heisenberg model with an external staggered field on an exactly cubical space - time box ( which requires a very precise value of @xmath0 ) , in addition to being able to determine the numerical values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such investigation also provides a good opportunity to exam the validity of predictions from the corresponding low - energy effective field theories @xcite .    for ( sub - lattice )",
    "magnetization density and spin stiffness , one can directly measure the related observables and then use experimental finite lattice extrapolation formulae to obtain the bulk values of these 2 low - energy constants . on the other hand , the spin - wave velocity @xmath0 is always determined in a less direct manner conventionally .",
    "motivated by the so - called cubical regime ( defined later ) in magnon chiral perturbation theory @xcite , we propose a new method to calculate the spin - wave velocity @xmath0 of spin-1/2 antiferromagnets with @xmath1 symmetry in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "specifically , we propose that @xmath0 can be calculated by @xmath2 when the squares of spatial and temporal winding numbers are tuned to be the same . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath16 are the spatial box size and the inverse temperature used in the simulations when above condition is met .",
    "since this method allows one to measure @xmath0 in a direct manner , the result is more accurate than other methods . indeed",
    "as we will demonstrate later , for quantum spin-1/2 xy model , the numerical value of @xmath5 we obtain using the new idea is of high precision and is consistent with the known monte carlo results in the literature as well @xcite .",
    "further , by simultaneously fitting our monte carlo data of susceptibilities @xmath6 and spin susceptibilities @xmath7 to their theoretical predictions from magnon chiral perturbation theory @xcite , we find @xmath0 is given by @xmath8 which is consistent with the one we obtain by the new method .",
    "these results confirm the validity and usefullness of our new method .",
    "additionally other two low - energy constants , namely the magnetization density @xmath9 and spin stiffness @xmath10 of spin-1/2 xy model are calculated with high accuracy and are much precise than previous monte carlo estimates @xcite .    the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . after a brief introduction to our motivation of this study ,",
    "we summarize the model and observables investigated here .",
    "follows that we review the corresponding effective field theory predictions relevant to our study .",
    "then we present our numerical results .",
    "in particular we demonstrate the validity of the method we used in our simulations to determine the low - energy constant @xmath0 . along the verification ,",
    "the low - energy constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 are also calculated .",
    "finally a section is devoted to the conclusion of our investigation .",
    "the quantum xy model we consider in this study is defined by the hamilton operator @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the first and second components of a spin- 1/2 operator at site @xmath20 , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 denotes a pair of nearest neighbor sites on a square lattice .",
    "further , @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) is the antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "a physical quantity of central interest is the susceptibility which is given by @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the inverse temperature , @xmath4 is the spatial box size , @xmath24 is the partition function and @xmath25 is the first component of magnetization .",
    "another relevant quantity is the spin susceptibility which is given by @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath27 .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be measured very efficiently with the loop - cluster algorithm using improved estimators @xcite . in particular , in the multi - cluster version of the algorithm",
    "the susceptibility is given in terms of the cluster sizes @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , the spin susceptibility @xmath30 is given in terms of the temporal winding number @xmath31 which is the sum of winding numbers @xmath32 of the loop - clusters @xmath33 around the euclidean time direction .",
    "finally , the spatial winding numbers are defined by @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "due to the spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath36 symmetry , the low - energy physics of antiferromagnets with an @xmath36 symmetry is governed by one massless goldstone boson .",
    "detailed calculations of a variety of physical quantities for the spin-1/2 antiferromagnets with @xmath1 symmetry including the nnlo contributions have been carried out in @xcite .",
    "here we only quote the results that are relevant to our study .",
    "the aspect ratio of a spatially quadratic space - time box with box size @xmath4 is characterized by @xmath37 with which one distinguishes cubical space - time volumes with @xmath38 from cylindrical ones with @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath0 appearing above is the low - energy constant spin - wave velocity . in the cubical regime , the volume- and temperature - dependence of the susceptibility",
    "is given by @xmath40 + o\\left(\\frac{1}{l^3}\\right ) \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the magnetization density and @xmath10 is the spin stiffness .",
    "further the spin susceptibility in the cubical regime takes the form @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ chiscube ] ) , the functions @xmath42 , which only depend on @xmath43 , are shape coefficients of the space - time box defined in @xcite . finally , in the cylindrical regime , the temperature- and volume - dependence of the spin susceptibility @xmath7 at very low temperature , namely when the condition @xmath44 is satisfied , is given by @xmath45 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "conventionally the spin - wave velocity @xmath0 is determinated indirectly in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "for example , magnon chiral perturbation theory predicts that the finite - volume dependence of the ground state internal energy density is given by @xcite @xmath46 by fitting the related monte carlo data to above equation , @xmath0 can be obtained from the coefficient associated with the term of @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ genergyd ] ) .",
    "further , @xmath0 can be calculated by the standard hydrodynamic relation @xmath48 as well .",
    "notice for both methods mentioned above , extrapolations to infinite volume limit are necessary in order to obtain the numerical value of @xmath0 . in other word , @xmath0 is determined indirectly and the step of extraoplations will introduce systematic uncertainties into its numerical value .",
    "because of this , here we propose a new method to calculate the numerical value of @xmath0 for the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic models with @xmath1 symmetry directly in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "our new idea is motivated by the so - called cubical regime in magon chiral perturbation theory @xcite . specifically in magon",
    "chiral perturbation theory , an exactly cubical space - time box is obtained through the condition @xmath49 , here again @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the inverse temperature and the spatial box size , respectively .",
    "further , in a monte carlo calculation , if one simulates the system in an exactly cubical space - time box , then the average of the square of spatial winding numbers @xmath50 and the square of temporal winding number @xmath51 should be the same .",
    "once the condition @xmath52 is met , @xmath0 can be determined by @xmath2 . in practice , to employ this new method to calculate @xmath0 , for a given box size @xmath4 , one varied @xmath3 until the condition @xmath52 is reached .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the method we propose here to determine the low - energy constant @xmath0 applies to any quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic system with a spontaneous symmetry breaking from a global @xmath1 symmetry to its @xmath53 subgroup .",
    "notice since the @xmath0 in the criterion of an exactly cubical space - time box , namely @xmath49 is its bulk value , one would expect the @xmath0 calculated by this new method suffers very mild finite lattice effects . indeed , as we will demonstrate shortly , for the quantum xy model considered in this study , th nunerical value of @xmath0 obtained by the new method is saturated to its bulk value even at @xmath54 .    to verify the validity of the new method we propose here to calculate @xmath0 in monte carlo simulations , we have carried out several simulations using a continuum - time loop algorithm with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "further , by tuning the inverse temperature @xmath3 for each simulations to reach an exactly cubical space - time box , the numerical values for @xmath0 determined from these simulations with @xmath57 are given by @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] demonstrates the results of such calculations .",
    "the 3 values for @xmath0 obtained at different box sizes are consistent with each other and agree with earlier monte carlo result of @xmath0 as well @xcite .",
    "this provides a convinving evidence to support the validity of our new method of calculating @xmath0 from the squares of spatial and temporal winding numbers . by a weighted average over these values of @xmath0 determined at different box sizes , the final result of the numerical value for the low - energy constant @xmath0 in this study obtained by the new method",
    "is given @xmath5 .",
    "we have additionally carried out simulations with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( which corresponds to @xmath63 ) .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 obtained from these new runs are given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this result implies that the method of calculating @xmath0 through the squares of spatial and temporal winding numbers indeed suffers very mild finite volume effects , at least for the model considered in this study .",
    "we notice that the @xmath10 corresponding to these new runs is given by @xmath68 which is statistically consistent with @xmath69 calculated at @xmath54 .",
    "0.3 cm [ fig1 ]    another way to exam whether the new idea of calculating @xmath0 through the squares of winding numbers is quantitatively correct is to extract @xmath0 by fitting monte carlo data of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the cubical regime to their predicted volume- and temperature - dependence , namely eqs .",
    "( [ chiscube ] ) and ( [ chiucube ] ) , respectively .",
    "however notice since @xmath0 always appears as the quantity @xmath70 or @xmath71 in eqs .",
    "( [ chiscube ] ) and ( [ chiucube ] ) , @xmath0 and @xmath10 are highly correlated and it would be a challenge to extract @xmath0 accurately from the fits . fortunately we observe from our monte carlo data that the observable @xmath64 which is exactly @xmath72 when @xmath73 already reaches a constant for @xmath74 . hence in our simultaneous fits , we also include an improved estimate of the @xmath75 data obtained earlier when determining @xmath0 using the new method and fit these data points to a constant . by simultaneously fitting cubical regime data of @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath74 as well as the data of @xmath75 to their predicted volume- and temperature - dependence formulae ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath8 with a @xmath76 .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in figures [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath0 calculated from the chiral fits agree nicely with the one detemined using the new method .",
    "using large volume data points ( @xmath77 ) for the fits leads to consistent results .",
    "this in turn proves the quantitative correctness of the new method of determining @xmath0 using the squares of winding numbers .",
    "notice the values for @xmath9 and @xmath10 we obtain are consistent with the known values from monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "they are in good agreement with the related results from series expansion and spin - wave calculations in the literature as well @xcite .",
    "further , the numerical values of these low - energy constants we obtain are much precise than those calculated in earlier monte carlo study . finally using the values for @xmath10 and @xmath0 determined in the cubical regime as well as eq .",
    "( [ chiucylin ] ) , we have compared the theoretical prediction and monte carlo data for @xmath7 in the cylindrical regime .",
    "the result of such comparsion is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "considering the fact that there is no free parameter , the agreement demonstrated in figure [ fig5 ] is reasonably good .",
