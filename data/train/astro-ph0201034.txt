    "the claim that the measured brightnesses of type ia supernovae at redshifts 0.1 - 1.0 imply @xmath4 ( schmidt et al 1998 , garnavich et al 1998 , riess et al 1998 , perlmutter et al 1999 , fillipenko and riess 2000 , riess et al 2001 , turner and riess 2001 ) has had a dramatic effect on cosmology . the model with @xmath5",
    "= 0.7 , where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 = 0.3 has become a concensus model , believed to be consistent with most evidence from large - scale stucture and cmb fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "i test the strength of the evidence that @xmath4 and show that there are inconsistencies in the way the supernovae data have been analyzed . when these are removed , the strength of the evidence for @xmath4 is much diminished .",
    "to set the scene , fig 1 shows @xmath8 versus log ( cz ) for 117 type ia supernovae since 1956 from the barbon et al ( 1998 ) catalogue ( excluding those labelled * which are discovery magnitudes only ) , together with published supernovae from the high z programmes , corrected for galactic and internal extinction , but not for decay - time effects , together with predicted curves from an @xmath2 = 1 model . at first sight",
    "there is not an enormous difference between the high z and low z supernovae , except that the latter seem to show a larger scatter .",
    "fig 2 shows the same excluding less reliable data ( flagged : , in the barbon et al catalogue , or objects with pg magnitudes only ( leibundgut et al ( 1991 ) ) , correcting for peculiar velocity effects ( see section 3 ) , using the phillips et al ( 1999 ) internal extinction correction ( see section 2 ) where available , and deleting two objects for which the dust correction is @xmath9 1.4 mag .",
    "the scatter for the low z supernovae appears to have been reduced .",
    "finally fig 3 shows the supernovae actually used by perlmutter et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "now the scatter in the low z supernovae is not much different from the high z supernovae and a difference in absolute magnitude between low z and high z supernovae , relative to an @xmath2 = 1 model , can be perceived .",
    "however comparison with fig 2 suggests that the low z supernovae used may be an abnormally luminous subset of all supernovae .",
    "we will return to this point in section 4 .",
    "excellent recent reviews of type ia supernovae , which fully discuss whether they can be thought of as a homogenous population , have been given by branch ( 1998 ) , hildebrand and niemeyer ( 2000 ) and leibundgut ( 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "in this paper i shall assume that they form a single population and that their absolute magnitude at maximum light depends , at most , on a small number of parameters .",
    "i do not , for example , consider the possibility of evolution , discussed by drell et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "absolute magnitudes are quoted for @xmath10 = 100 throughout .",
    "one of the most surprising claims of the high z supernovae teams is that internal extinction in the high z supernovae is small or even negligible ( perlmutter et al 1999 , riess et al 2000 ) .",
    "while some nearby type ia supernovae take place in elliptical galaxies , where internal extinction in the host galaxy may indeed be negligible , the majority take place in spiral galaxies , where internal extinction can not be neglected .",
    "moreover as we look back towards z = 1 , we know from the cfrs survey that there is a marked increase in the fraction of star - forming systems ( lilly et al 1996 ) , and we would expect the average host galaxy extinction to be , if anything , higher than in low z supernovae .    on average , the extinction along the line of sight to a ( non edge - on ) spiral galaxy can be represented by de vaucouleurs s prescription ( de vaucouleurs et al 1976 ) :    @xmath11 = 0.17 + @xmath12 , for t @xmath9 -4 , = 0 for t = -4 , -5 ,    where t is the de vaucouleurs galaxy type , a , b are the major and minor diameters of the galaxy , and @xmath13(t ) = 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 for t = -3 , -2 , -1 , 0 , 1 - 8 , respectively .",
    "i assume @xmath14 = 0.2 where this not known .",
    "the extinction to a particularly supernova can be expected to show marked deviations from this average value , since the dust distributions in galactic discs are very patchy .",
    "because of the cirrus - like distribution of interstellar dust clouds , lines - of - sight to some stars will have much lower extinctions than this average value .",
    "the presence of dense molecular clouds in the galaxy means that other lines - of - sight can have very much higher extinctions .",
    "phillips et al ( 1999 ) have analyzed the extinction to 62 type ia supernovae , using both the colours at maximum light and the colours at very late time , 30 - 90 days after maximum .",
    "their extinction corrections do resolve a number of cases of anomalously faint type ia supernovae ( eg 1995e , 1996z , 1996ai ) .",
    "the agreement of their internal extinction values with those given by the de vaucouleurs prescription is not brilliant in detail ( see table 1 ) , but as expected give broadly the same median values ( median @xmath11 for phillips et al sample : 0.29 , median de vaucouleurs correction for same sample : 0.33 ) .",
    "these median values are broadly consistent with the monte carlo simulations of hatano et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the correlation between @xmath11 and the ( b - v ) colour at maximum light , corrected for galactic extinction , with different symbols for phillips et al ( 1999 ) estimates and those derived from the de vaucouleurs prescription .",
    "the distribution is consistent with an intrinsic ( unreddened ) colour range of ( b - v ) = -0.1 to 0.1 , combined with the usual @xmath11 = 4.14 ( b - v ) relation .",
    "riess et al ( 1998 ) have given estimates of the total extinction ( @xmath15 for their sample of low supernova derived both via the mlcs method and via a set of templates ( their table 10 ) .",
    "we can compare the template estimates directly with those of phillips et al ( 1999 ) for the same galaxies ( fig 5 ) .",
    "the riess et al values are lower on average by 0.22 magnitudes , which implies that the set of templates ( and the training set for the mlcs method ) have not been completely dereddened .",
    "the large scatter in this diagram perhaps indicates the difficulty of estimating the host galaxy extinction for supernovae . if this average underestimate of 0.22 mag .",
    "is added to the riess et al estimates of @xmath11 for high - z supernovae , the average value of @xmath11 for these is almost identical to that for low z supernovae .",
    "thus the claim that high z supernovae have lower extinction than low z supernovae seems to be based on a systematic underestimate of extinction in the high z galaxies .",
    "perlmutter et al ( 1999 ) estimate that host galaxy extinction is on average small both in local and high z supernovae , and neglect it in most of their solutions .",
    "parodi et al ( 2000 ) neglect internal extinction completely , preferring to cut out the redder objects ( b - v@xmath90.1 ) from their samples .",
    "this will not change the relative absolute magnitudes between low and high z ( or between supernovae with cepheid calibration and the others ) provided the two samples end up with the same mean extinction .",
    "this , however , might be difficult to guarantee .",
    "i have preferred to correct the low z supernovae as described above , and then correct the perlmutter et al data by an average host galaxy extinction of 0.33 mag .",
    "ellis and sullivan ( 2001 ) have carried out hst imaging and keck spectroscopy on host galaxies for supernova used by perlmutter et al ( 1999 ) and find that the hubble diagram for supernovae in later type galaxies shows more scatter than those hosted by e@xmath16s0 galaxies , presumably due to the effects of host galaxy extinction .",
    "for nearby supernovae it is important to correct for the peculiar velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "hamuy et al ( 1995 ) tackle this be setting a minimum recession velocity of 2500 @xmath17 for their local sample .",
    "however since peculiar velocities can easily be in excess of 500 @xmath17 this is probably not sufficient for an accurate result . here",
    "i have used the model for the local ( z @xmath18 0.1 ) velocity field developed to analyze the cmb dipole , using data from the iras pscz redshift survey ( rowan - robinson et al 2000 ) .",
    "i estimate the velocity error in estimates from this model to be 100 + 0.2 x v @xmath17 for v @xmath18 15000 @xmath17 , 400 @xmath17 for v @xmath9 15000 @xmath17 .",
    "these errors are incorporated into the subsequent analysis ( points are weighted by error@xmath19 ) .",
    "the code for this peculiar velocity model is available at http://astro.ic.ac.uk/@xmath20mrr .",
    "tables 1 and 2 gives data for the type ia supernovae used in the present study .",
    "the columns are as follows : ( 1 ) supernova name , ( 2 ) host galaxy recession velocity , ( 3 ) same , corrected for peculiar velocity , ( 4 ) blue magnitude at maximum light @xmath8 , ( 5 ) @xmath21 , from schlegel et al ( 1998 ) , ( 6 ) @xmath11 from de vaucouleurs et al ( 1976 ) presciption , ( 7 ) @xmath11 from phillips et al ( 1999 ) , ( 8) absolute magnitude @xmath22 ( @xmath2 = 1 universe ) , ( 9 ) distance modulus , assuming @xmath22 = -19.47 ( gibson et al 2000 ) , ( 10 ) @xmath23 , ( 11 ) @xmath24 .",
    "sources of @xmath8 , in order of preference : hamuy et al ( 1996)/perlmutter et al ( 1999)/riess et al ( 1998 , barbon et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "sources of @xmath23 , in order of preference : phillips et al ( 1999 ) , saha et al ( 1999 ) , riess et al ( 1998 ) , parodi et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "sources of @xmath24 : hamuy et al ( 1996 ) , saha et al ( 1999 ) , parodi et al ( 2001 ) , leibundgut et al ( 1991 ) .",
    "once we have corrected for the effects of internal extinction , we can test whether the absolute magnitude of supernovae at maximum light depends on decay time , or some other parameter like the colour at maximum light @xmath24 , as proposed by tripp and branch ( 1999 ) , and parodi et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "phillips ( 1993 ) proposed that there is a strong dependence of absolute magnitude at maximum light and the decay - time , characterized by the blue magnitude change during the 15 days after maximum , @xmath23 .",
    "specifically he found @xmath25 = 2.70 .",
    "riess et al ( 1995 ) showed that the dispersion in the sn ia hubble diagram was significantly reduced by applying this correction .",
    "tammann and sandage ( 1995 ) used supernovae in galaxies for which distance estimates were available to set a strong limit on the slope of the @xmath26 relation ( @xmath18 0.88 ) .",
    "hamuy et al ( 1996 ) used a new sample of well - studied supernovae to derive a b - band slope of 0.784 @xmath27 0.18 for the @xmath26 relation , consistent with the tammann and sandage limit , and much lower than the original claim of phillips ( 1993 ) .",
    "riess et al ( 1996 ) have discussed a related method of analyzing this correlation , the mlcs method .",
    "however there is a further consideration here .",
    "it is really only valid to carry out this analysis on supernovae which have been detected prior to maximum light .",
    "the process used hitherto by all workers in this field of extrapolating to maximum light assuming an @xmath26 , or equivalently mlcs , relation is assuming that all extrapolated objects adhere to the mean line of the relation , thus underestimating the scatter in the relation .",
    "this is a process which artificially improves the apparent signal - to - noise of the final hubble relation or @xmath4 signal .",
    "hamuy et al ( 1995 ) do make some allowance for this in assigning a larger uncertainty ( and hence lower weight ) to supernova first observed after maximum .",
    "fig 6 shows a plot of the absolute magnitude at maximum light , @xmath22 , corrected by 0.784 @xmath23 , versus @xmath24 , the colour at maximum light corrected for the effects of extinction , using the phillips et al ( 1999 ) estimates of extinction .",
    "no clear correlation remains between these corrected quantities .",
    "thus correction for the @xmath26 relation removes most of the correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "fig 7 shows the relations between @xmath22 , corrected for extinction , and @xmath28 , for objects detected at least 1 day prior to maximum light .",
    "the best fit linear relation is shown , which has slope 0.99 @xmath270.38 , consistent with values reported by hamuy et al ( 1995 ) , 0.85 @xmath270.13 , and by hamuy et al ( 1996 ) , 0.78 @xmath27 0.18 .",
    "however the significance of the relation is reduced , because of the smaller number of data points , and is now only 2.6 @xmath1 . the rms deviation from this mean",
    "relation is 0.44 mag , much larger than is generally claimed for this relation .",
    "for example , riess et al ( 1996 ) claim that the residual sigma after correction for the @xmath26 relation is 0.12 mag .",
    "the spurious reduction in scatter generated by extrapolating supernovae first observed after maximum can be seen in fig 8 , which shows the same relation for supernovae first observed after maximum .",
    "the same effect can in fact be seen in the top panel of fig 4 in parodi et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "the marked difference between fig 7 and 8 suggests that supernovae first observed after maximum should be excluded from the analysis .",
    "perlmutter et al ( 1999 ) have applied a different version of the @xmath26 method , which they call the stretch method , to high z supernovae .",
    "this method appears to give a significantly lower correction to @xmath22 as a function of @xmath23 ( leibundgut 2000 ) .",
    "figure 9 shows the perlmutter et al stretch correction to the absolute magnitude , as a function of @xmath23 , for 18 low z supernovae ( note that they omit the two supernovae with @xmath23 = 1.69 from their solution ) .",
    "the slope is 0.275 @xmath270.04 , only one third of the hamuy et al ( 1996 ) value .",
    "the method has been further discussed by efstathiou et al ( 1999 ) and goldhaber et al ( 2001 ) , but no explanation for the lower slope is given .",
    "with the criteria established above ( i ) that a full and consistent correction must be made for extinction , ( ii ) that if the the @xmath26 relation is used it should only be applied to supernovae detected before maximum light , we can now reexamine the hubble diagram for supernovae .",
    "i consider several different samples :    \\(1 ) all well - observed supernovae , with no correction for the @xmath26 relation .",
    "supernovae with only pg magnitudes are excluded , as also are supernovae first observed after maximum .",
    "the de vaucouleurs extinction correction is used for supernovae not studied by phillips et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "supernovae with @xmath29 1.4 are excluded .",
    "\\(2 ) all well - observed supernovae for which in addition @xmath23 is known , with correction for the @xmath26 relation , using the 0.784 slope of hamuy et al ( 1966 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) as ( 2 ) , but with internal extinction set to zero , as advocated by perlmutter et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) as ( 2 ) , but using the perlmutter stretch correction ( or 0.275 @xmath23 where stretch correction not available ) .",
    "\\(5 ) as ( 2 ) but using the quadratic @xmath23 correction of phillips et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "it was not possible to independently check the effect of applying the mlcs method for correcting for decay - time correlations because the set of training vectors published by riess et al ( 1996 ) is not the one actually being used in the high z supernova analysis ( riess et al 1998 ) .",
    "the mean absolute magnitudes for low z ( z @xmath18 0.1 ) and high z supernovae , in an einstein de sitter model are tabulated for the different samples in table 3 . without the correction for @xmath23 , the significance of the difference in absolute magnitude for 53 low and 52",
    "high redshift supernovae is only 2.8 @xmath1 , hardly sufficient to justify the current wide acceptance of positive @xmath0",
    ". the significance increases to 3.5 @xmath1 if only the 26 supernovae observed since 1990 are used .    including the @xmath23 correction , the significance increases to 4.0 @xmath1 ( 3.9 @xmath1 if we use the perlmutter correction , 4.6 @xmath1 if we use the quadratic @xmath23 correction of phillips et al 1999 , which is the form used by riess et al 1998 ) .",
    "could this increase in significance be due to some bias in the local supernova sample for which @xmath23 has been measured ?",
    "the mean absolute magnitude at maximum light , corrected for extinction but not for @xmath23 , for all 53 good low z supernovae is -18.54 .",
    "the mean for those for which @xmath23 has been measured is -18.64 , 0.1 magnitudes brighter .",
    "in fact the difference in the mean between those for which @xmath23 has been measured and those for which it has not been measured is 0.23 mag .",
    ", almost the size of the whole signal on which the claim for positive @xmath0 is based .",
    "however there is no difference in mean absolute magnitude between the mean absolute magnitude for the 10 local calan tololo supernovae used by by the high - z supernova teams and the 16 other local supernovae studied since 1990 , so there is no evidence that the calan tololo sample is biased .",
    "an alternative explanation of the fainter mean absolute magnitudes seen in the pre-1990 data is a systematic error in the photographic photometry used .",
    "there is another factor which may contribute to the apparent faintness of high z supernovae .",
    "current models of the star formation history of the universe , which show a strong peak in the star formation rate at z = 1 - 2 , imply that the mean dust optical depth in galaxies would be expected to increase with redshift out to z = 1.5 - 2 ( calzetti and heckman 1999 , pei et al 1999 ) .",
    "line 6 of table 3 shows the effect of adopting calzetti and heckman s model 3 for the evolution of @xmath30 , a model which agrees well with models for infrared and submillimetre sourcounts and backgrounds ( eg rowan - robinson 2001a ) and direct evidence from oberved estimates of the star formation history ( rowan - robinson 2001b ) .",
    "this correction , which increases the average @xmath11 for the high z supernovae by 0.15 mag . , is sufficient to reduce the significance of the magnitude difference between high and low z supernovae , in an einstein de sitter model , to 3.0 and 1.5 @xmath1 for cases with and without correction for @xmath23 .",
    "rowan - robinson ( 2001c ) has reviewed distance estimates and the hubble constant . in addition to type ia supernovae , s - z clusters and gravitational lens time - delay methods also give distance estimates at z @xmath9 0.1 .",
    "figure 10 shows a compilation of all these high z estimates .",
    "i have also included the hdf supernova ( 1997ff ) at the redshift 1.7 , proposed by riess et al ( 2001 ) although rowan - robinson ( 2001b ) finds a photometric redshift z = 1.4 for the parent galaxy .",
    "the assumed b band magnitude at maximum light is 25.5 ( fig 7 of riess et al ) and the mean absolute magnitude for type ia supernovae is assumed to be -19.47 ( gibson et al 2000 ) .",
    "the model with @xmath2 = 1 is a good overall fit to these data and the hdf supernova lies right on the @xmath2 = 1 mean line .",
    "a least squares fit to these data , with an assumed @xmath10 of 63 @xmath31 ( rowan - robinson 2001c ) and the spatial curvature parameter k = 0 , yields @xmath32 , where the error in the distance modulus has been taken to be 0.35 mag . for all points .    [ cols= \" < ,",
