    "# 1 almost a hundred years ago , lorentz calculated the self force on a charged particle , that is , the force exerted on the particle by its own radiation field . in an expansion in powers of the radius @xmath3 of the particle",
    ", he found for the force @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position vector of the particle , @xmath7 is a function of @xmath3 that goes like @xmath8 for small @xmath3 , the @xmath9 coefficient is independent of @xmath3 ( @xmath10 is the charge of the particle ) and the higher terms all go to zero as @xmath11 . in order to deal with the problem of the divergence of @xmath7 as @xmath11 , lorentz invented mass renormalization . applying newton s second law @xmath12 or , with @xmath13 fixed and @xmath11 , @xmath14 a finite equation of motion .",
    "however , the divergence problem returns through the back door : ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) has a run - away solution @xmath15 with a run - away time of @xmath16 , @xmath17 seconds for electrons .",
    "a lorentz covariant equation which reduces to ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) in the instantaneous rest system of the particle was proposed by dirac ; however , the run - away problem was not removed .",
    "of course , in the relativistic model it is the momentum , not the velocity , that runs away .",
    "the clearest algebraic insight into the problem , both classical and quantum , is obtained by finding an upper half - plane pole in the laplace transform @xmath18 of @xmath19 : @xmath20 here @xmath21 , with @xmath22 positive and large enough to make the integral converge . in appendix",
    "a we take that path and , following moniz and sharp ,   show that in a suitably cut - off classical theory there are no run - aways , no matter how small the cut - off radius , provided @xmath23 , the bare mass , is positive we then show that the mass renormalization , carried out for @xmath11 as described above , leads to run - aways .    in appendix b , we obtain the same result in a non - relativistic quantum theory .",
    "thus quantum effects per se do not cure the disease , nor does the addition of a confining oscillator potential .    in appendices",
    "a and b we considered , and in the following we consider , the simplest problem that shows the run - away effect : a charged ( in the limit ) point particle , which we shall call an electron , is in a wave - packet state with approximate momentum @xmath24 and energy @xmath25 for times @xmath26 . at @xmath27 , a weak spatially uniform external electric field @xmath28 is switched on , and we follow the electron s motion , calculating the mean value of the coordinate @xmath6 , or of the velocity @xmath29 .    the solution for @xmath18 is given for classical motion in ( [ eq : a.19 ] ) of appendix a and for the non - relativistic quantum case by ( [ eq : b.16 ] ) of appendix b : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the cut - off function , which must go to zero as @xmath32 fast enough to make the integral converge .",
    "@xmath33 is the laplace transform of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the quantum case represents the mean value of the variable .",
    "the absence ( in ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) of an upper half @xmath37 plane pole in the cut - off theory , and its emergence following lorentz s renormalization procedure , are shown in appendix a. the presence of such a pole in the laplace transform produces an exponential run - away in time , via the inversion formula @xmath38    the upper half plane pole appears at a frequency @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the fine structure constant .",
    "we point out here that for weak coupling the energy @xmath42 is deep in the relativistic region where the equations used to describe the system are certainly not valid . since relativistic spin @xmath43 quantum electrodynamics is known to hold accurately in that energy region , we presume that there will be no analogous pole in that theory . in the following",
    "we formulate a way of studying that issue , and indeed find no analogous pole in the relativistic spin @xmath43 theory .",
    "however , if a pole of the type suggested by landau , abrikosov and khalatnikov exists , either in the photon green s function or in the electron photon forward scattering amplitude , there would be a new type of run - away with the characteristic frequency @xmath44 , high enough so that there appears to be no way in which present day experiments can rule it out .",
    "of course , such a pole is already a symptom of a diseased theory .    in the following sections we will be calculating the mean value of the electron velocity , to lowest order in the external field . of course",
    ", the limitation of the electron s velocity to @xmath45 does not automatically occur in this approximation .",
    "however , if the electron momentum does run away , the limitation of the velocity to @xmath45 will appear as a non - linear effect of the external field . correspondingly",
    ", the linear approximation to a run - away momentum would be a run - away velocity , for which we search .",
    "we work in the schroedinger representation with a state vector @xmath46 which satisfies the equation @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the electron - photon hamiltonian , and @xmath49 the interaction hamiltonian with the spatially uniform external field : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the electron current density @xmath53 where @xmath54 have their usual meaning .",

    "with @xmath79 we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 so that @xmath82 as just described , we replace @xmath59 by @xmath83 and leave the @xmath76 integral in ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) undone .",
    "the mean value of the velocity is then given by @xmath84 with @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 understood to be zero for @xmath58 .",

    "however , since the theory is not finite , we are not justified in drawing that conclusion .",
    "we must rather deal with the mass and charge renormalized theory , which in practise means order by order perturbation theory in @xmath41 . in the next section",
    "we will show how the expression @xmath95 in ( [ eq:2.26 ] ) can be calculated order by order from feynman diagrams .",
    "before we turn to that , we exploit ( [ eq:2.26 ] ) to calculate the zeroth order ( in the fine structure constant ) motion of the electron in the weak external field .",

    "it is @xmath137 here we recognize the operator @xmath138 so that @xmath139 is the velocity expressed in the interaction representation , and @xmath140 where the @xmath141 matrix @xmath142 , and where we have used the unitarity of @xmath143 and its group property : @xmath144 the @xmath141 matrix is diagonal on one particle states . since there is no self - energy correction , it must be a phase , which is canceled by disconnected diagrams .",
    "in ( [ eq:3.7 ] ) we see @xmath145 expressed in a way which allows us to make use of the dyson technique and feynman diagrams .",

    "the sum of all such diagrams is @xmath152 since @xmath153 .",
    "thus , @xmath154 is both ultra - violet and infra - red finite , and equal to its expected free particle value , @xmath155 the closed fermion loop diagrams cancel because @xmath156 and @xmath56 carry the same charge renormalization .",
    "we turn next to the effect of the external field as given by ( [ eq:2.23 ] ) .",

    "the high @xmath163 dependence of each of the diagrams ( 1b ) , ( 1d ) , ( 1e ) and ( 1f ) is @xmath169 .",
    "however , when the four diagrams are added the logarithms cancel , leading to a high @xmath37 dependence in the odd amplitudes @xmath170 which therefore can not in weak coupling produce the upper half plane singularity which classically leads to the run - away solutions .",
    "note however that the above simple asymptotic calculation only shows a cancellation in the @xmath107 odd amplitude .",
    "the logarithms in the @xmath107 even amplitudes fail to cancel , leaving the possibility of a singularity of order @xmath171 in the even amplitudes , and a run - away @xmath172 in the even amplitudes .",

    "the second order results of these calculations are given in appendix c.    the relativistic theory brings in a new effect , the electron - positron vacuum polarization .",
