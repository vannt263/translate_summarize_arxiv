    "recently a wealth of x - ray observations has provided more detailed information about spectra of x - ray sources and short - time variability .",

    "the new observations put more stringent constraints on the modelling of accretion processes . in this connection the change from accretion in a standard cool disk to a hot coronal flow is an important feature .",

    "the description of an optically thick , geometrically thin disk , now often called `` standard thin disk '' , goes back to work of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) , lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ) and others .",
    "a much hotter self - consistent solution of optically thin gas was discovered by shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) , but found to be thermally unstable by piran ( 1978 ) . a solution for even super - eddington accretion rates in which the large optical depth of the inflowing gas prevents radiation to escape",

    "ichimaru 1977 and rees et al .",
    "detailed theoretical work on this solution by several authors has proven that this optically thin regime of solutions for low accretion rates is relevant for accretion in many cases ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , b , abramowicz , chen & kato et al .",

    "the model of an optically thin advection - dominated flow ( adaf ) allows to explain the accretion in soft x - ray transients during quiescence . assuming the old picture of a standard thin accretion disk reaching inward towards the black hole the amount of x - ray flux is clearly inconsistent with the accretion rate estimated from the outer optically thick disk ( mcclintock et al .",
    "an interior adaf allows to understand the observations but requires the change from a standard thin disk to the hot flow at a certain transition radius . the black hole x - ray transients are a laboratory for accretion on to black holes .",
    "the physics of the accretion processes around supermassive black holes in agn is similar , which makes the investigation of adaf even more important and fruitful .",
    "the change from a geometrically thin disk to the hot flow is an essential feature in this overall picture of accretion .",
    "the `` strong adaf principle '' , formulated by narayan & yi ( 1995b ) , suggests that , whenever the accreting gas has a choice between a standard thin disk and an adaf , the adaf configuration is chosen .",

    "the situation is the same in disks around black holes ( meyer 1999 ) , both stellar and supermassive .",

    "heat released by friction in the corona flows down into cooler and denser transition layers .",
    "there it is radiated away if the density is sufficiently high .",
    "if the density is too low , cool matter is heated up and evaporated into the corona until an equilibrium density is established .",

    "this evaporation rate increases steeply with decreasing distance from the central compact star . when the evaporation rate exceeds the mass flow rate in the cool disk , a hole forms up to the distance where both rates are equal .",

    "the mass flow in the corona is similar to that in the thin disk .",

    "we model the equilibrium between corona and thin disk in a simplified way using a one - zone model as described in sect .",
    "this is possible since the evaporation process is concentrated near the inner edge of the thin disk and we can choose a representative radial region from @xmath46 to @xmath47 such that the main interaction between cool disk and corona occurs there and evaporation further outward is not important . in fig .",

    "( 1 ) near the inner edge of the thin disk the gas flows towards the black hole .",
    "( 2 ) at larger @xmath1 wind loss is important taking away about 20% of the total matter inflow . ( 3 ) at even larger distances some matter flows outward in the corona as a consequence of conservation of angular momentum .",

    "this yields the further proportionalities @xmath267 @xmath268 this may serve as a guide on how the results depend on the choice of these parameter values . for values of @xmath242 discussed in the literature see sect .",
    "8 .      for our numerical computations we took @xmath22=0.3 .",
    "values discussed in the literature include 0.1 to 0.3 from spectral fits of adaf models to soft x - ray transients ( narayan et al .",
    "1996 ) , @xmath22=0.25 obtained from applying detailed calculations to luminous black hole x - ray binaries ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ) , and @xmath22=0.1 obtained from global magnetohydrodynamical simulations of accretion tori ( hawley 2000 ) .",
    "the above scaling relation shows how our results change if other @xmath22-values are chosen .",
    "x - ray irradiation can cause a corona above the thin disk ( e.g. london et al . 1981 ) .",
    "this can interfere with the assumptions underlying the present model .",
    "we note that optically thick scattering layers in the inner corona can prevent such radiation to reach the disk surface ( e.g. see schandl & meyer 1994 ) .",
    "this can become a complex situation which requires a detailed analysis to clarify under what circumstances this affects the applicability of our model . in general , models like ours should be good for black hole systems with adaf type internal accretion",
    ". aspects of formation of a disk corona have been investigated by de kool & wickramasinghe ( 1999 ) .",
    "these calculations are more detailed with respect to ionization equilibrium than ours , but do not include thermal conduction , sidewise advection and wind loss in the energy balance .",
    "it is therefore difficult to compare with our results .",
    "here we have considered the spatial co - existence of disk and corona and its gradual fading into a corona / adaf only region at its inner boundary .",
    "honma ( 1996 ) in an apparently very different approach considered the effect of a turbulent diffusive heat flow outwards from a hot and mainly non - radiative advection - dominated inner region to an outercool accretion disk . in his simplified modelling",
    "both regions are treated as one disk with radially varying thickness , and optical depth .",
    "he found a steep transition in the disk thickness and temperature at a radius that depends on the mass flow rate . in this radially thin transition layer",
    "most of the systems luminosity is radiated .",
    "though at first sight very different , the two approaches have a basic physical similarity , though in an inverted geometry : what is vertical in the disk+corona system is radial in honma s approach .",
    "heat generated by friction is conducted outward ( downward ) from a hot inner ( upper ) region to a cool outer ( lower ) region where it is radiated away . in both cases",
    "this establishes the condition where the cool disk ends and the hot , adaf type flow takes over .",
    "we note that honma s diffusive heat conductivity bears resemblance to the thermal electron heat conductivity .",
    "the rapid increase of the cooling with density leads to a similarly steep temperature profile in honma s model as at the base of the corona in the disk+corona model .",
    "we have calculated the ratio of honma s effective turbulent heat conductivity to that of electron thermal heat conductivity and obtain the value 1/6 for pressure and temperature at the peak of the coronal mass flow rate in table 1 .",
    "we think that the evaporation model is a more realistic description of the transition from the cool disk to an corona / adaf only flow . in sect .",
    "2.5 we estimated the radial heat inflow and showed that it is a minor contribution . generally , the turbulent outward diffusion of specific energy reduces the inward advective transport ( which is also diffusive ) of energy .",
    "thus the inward flow of energy is somewhat less than the inward flow of mass times the specific energy .",
    "our approximate treatment of the inward flows of mass and energy in the derivations of eqs .",
    "( 39 ) and ( 46 ) in effect leads to such a distinction , for radial power laws as discussed by a factor of 2 .    in spite of the very different geometry and simplification honma s model",
    "captures the same physical effect .",
    "his conclusion that his results shed light on the soft - hard transitions of black hole accretors is thus substantiated by the disk+corona model , though quantative differences exist . in sect .",
    "5 we have already remarked on where the `` strong adaf proposal '' agrees with and where it deviates from the results of the disk+corona model .",
    "this brings the `` strong adaf proposal '' , honma s diffusive heat transport model , and the disk+corona model under a common physical aspect and makes a surprising similarity of some of their results results understandable .",
    "our model describes the interaction between the geometrically thin accretion disk and the corona above .",
    "we have derived simplified equations , which include the relevant processes determining the accretion via the cool disk together with the hot coronal flow which yields the matter supply for the adaf towards the black hole .",
    "we determine the structure of the corona which is in equilibrium with the cool disk .",
    "the equilibrium demands the evaporation of a certain amount of matter from the cool disk and we compute the evaporation rate as a function of the distance @xmath1 from the central black hole .",
    "this gives the rate of accretion of matter towards the inner region ( part of the matter is lost by a wind ) . the evaporation efficiency becomes higher with decreasing @xmath1 , but reaches a maximum at some hundred schwarzschild radii . for low accretion rates in the cool disk",
    "the evaporation uses up all matter at the distance where the evaporation rate is equal to the mass flow rate in the cool disk .",
    "the standard thin disk emits a near black body spectrum and , for high enough accretion rates the disk extends inward to the last stable orbit , the total radiation is soft .",
    "but if , for lower accretion rates the thin disk is truncated , the coronal flow / adaf in the inner region provides a hard spectrum .    these features of disk evaporation apply to galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( x - ray transients , high - mass x - ray binaries ) and also to agn ( truncated disks were found in low - luminosity agn and elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "the mass accretion rates derived by spectral fits based on the adaf model and the location of the inner disk ( deduced from observations or determined by the fitting ) allow to check the predictions of the model for the location of transition to the coronal flow .",
    "these tests show good agreement for most cases of x - ray transients and the features connected with the maximum evaporation efficiency ( see sect . 9 ) .",
    "we want to point out that our model gives qualitative results for relations between mass accretion rate , location of disk truncation and spectral transitions rather than exact values .",
    "the division in an outer advection - dominated regime and an inner radiation - dominated regime of the coronal structure gives insight to basic features .",
    "computed values for the edge location might differ by a factor of two to three from the \" true  values .",
    "an investigation of the detailed effect of simplifications in the equations as well as the effect of the @xmath22-value and of magnetic fields will be carried out later .",
    "a truncation of the thin disk farther in than 100 schwarzschild radii is in contrast to the predictions of our model .",
    "the reflecting component observed for cyg x-1 seems to indicate such an inward extent of the thin disk .",
    "but , also for cyg x-1 , another investigation of observations leads to an inner edge location near 100 schwarzschild radii ( see sect .",
    "this situation needs further clarification . but also from the theoretical side the possible existence of an `` interior '' thin disk below a corona in the innermost regions ( closer in than the location of the evaporation efficiency maximum , compare fig .",
    "3 ) needs further investigation .    for agn it was found , based on adaf spectral modelling that the truncation of the thin disk can be at very different distances from the supermassive black hole for mass accretion rates which differ much less ( see sect . 9 ) .",
    "our model only predicts the large distances . also here",
    "additional investigations are needed to understand the physical reason for such divergent results .",
    "_ note added after submission of the manuscript : in a parallel investigation , very similar to our approach , raska & czerny ( astro - ph/0004158 , a&a in press ) have also studied the coronal structure and the transition to an adaf .",
    "they take into account the possibility of different temperatures of electrons and ions and include compton cooling by the soft radiation from the underlying disk . in our computed models for the parameters @xmath269 , that means log @xmath270 ( compare table 1 ) , the energy equilibration time between electrons and ions is shorter than the heating time , thus establishing temperature equilibrium between electrons and ions . for the same parameters also",
    "the rate of compton cooling by the radiation from the underlying disk is small compared to the frictional heating rate and thus negligible . _",
