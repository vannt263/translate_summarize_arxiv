    "in this paper we study a general discrete framework for control of two - phase fluids governed by the thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model proposed in @xcite . for the discretization we use the approach of @xcite , where the authors propose a time discretization scheme , that preserves this important property in the time discrete setting and , using a post - processing step , also in the fully discrete setting including adaptive mesh discretization . as control actions we consider distributed control , dirichlet boundary control , and control with the initial condition of the phase field .    for the practical implementation we adapt the adaptive treatment developed in @xcite to the optimal control setting .",
    "on the discrete level , special emphasis has to be be taken for the control with the intial value of the phase field , since the distribution of its phases is an outcome of the optimization procedure and thus a - priori unknown . in this case",

    "the focus of the present work is different in that we consider numerical analysis of the fully discrete problem , propose a tailored numerical adaptive concept for the control problem , and present numerical examples which clearly show the potential of our approach .",
