    "decays of b mesons to final states containing charmonium constitute a very sensitive laboratory for the study of electro - weak interactions , as well as the dynamics of strong interactions .",
    "the semi - inclusive @xmath6 productions in b decays had ever risen tough challenges for understanding its large rate@xcite which require large contribution beyond color singlet model for charmonium production at @xmath7 scale@xcite . currently its large production rate could be understood in the framework of non - relativistic qcd(nrqcd ) effective field theory@xcite .",
    "however , the momentum spectrum of @xmath6 , especially the excess of slow @xmath6 meson , is still hard for theoretical explanation , which may reveal interesting phenomena of the possible intrinsic charm component of the b@xcite , the decay @xmath8 baryon anti - baryon@xcite and the production of @xmath9 hybrid@xcite .",
    "the exclusive decays @xmath10 have also attracted very extensive theoretical and experimental studies , which involve more complicated strong dynamics .",
    "the recent studies@xcite have shown that it is hard to account for its large rates and polarizations theoretically .    in this paper , we present a study of the radiative annihilation decays @xmath11 , which is much rarer than @xmath12 , however , involve simpler hadronic dynamics .",
    "in naive factorization approach , these decays involve the form factors which are similar to those of the radiative leptonic decays@xcite .",
    "it is shown that the form factors could be described simply in terms of a convolution of the b meson distribution function with a perturbative kernel@xcite .",
    "beyond naive factorization approach , non - factorization contributions only arise from one loop vertex qcd corrections which can be calculate properly in the framework of qcd factorization@xcite .",
    "we find @xmath13 and @xmath14 in naive factorization approach .",
    "with qcd factorization approach , these branching ratios are reduced to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , because the effective coefficient @xmath17 gets smaller than it in naive factorization .",
    "such effects have also been found in two body b non - leptonic decays@xcite where the vertex - type one loop qcd corrections make @xmath18 much smaller than it naive one , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "compared with two body non - leptonic b decays , the troublesome hard spectator scattering contribution is absent and only the well defined vertex type nonfactorizable corrections are encountered . to this extend , the decays @xmath20 could be used to test factorization schemes . on the other hand",
    ", these decays could serve as probes for new physics activities as low energy scale . as an example , we take these decays as probes of the chirality of weak currents induced the decays @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we present our study of @xmath22 in the standard model(sm ) . in sec.3",
    ", we will calculate the effect of the possible admixture of @xmath23 current @xmath24 to the standard @xmath25 current @xmath26@xmath27 in the decays @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "this admixture could lead to enhancement of the decays branching ratios .",
    "the effects of the small value of @xmath28 could show up signals of the activity of new physics .",
    "we start our study from the effective hamiltonian relevant to @xmath29 @xmath1 decays in the sm @xcite @xmath30   -v_{tb }   v^{*}_{tq}\\sum_{i=3}^{10}c_{i}(\\mu)\\mathcal{o}_{i}(\\mu)\\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where q = s , d and @xmath31 ( i=1,@xmath32,10 ) are the effective wilson coefficients at next - to - leading order evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath33 .",
    "the effective operators can be expressed explicitly as follows@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the su(3 ) color indices .",
    "@xmath1 decays .",
    "the photon radiated from other quarks are suppressed by power of @xmath37 . ]    under naive factorization , the @xmath38 @xmath1 decays are represented by fig.1 .",
    "the dominant mechanism is the radiation of the photon from the light quark in the b meson .",
    "generally the amplitude is suppressed by one order of @xmath39 because @xmath6 meson must be transversely polarized and b meson is heavy .",
    "radiation of the photon from the remaining three quark lines is further suppressed additionally by power of @xmath40 , which will be neglected in this paper .    in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the decay amplitude of @xmath41 @xmath1 to leading order is @xmath42\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the approximation @xmath43 has been made , the parameter @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are transverse polarization vectors of photon and @xmath6 meson respectively .",
    "the form factor @xmath50 is defined by @xcite @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at leading order of @xmath52 , the two form factors are given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the first inverse moment of the b - meson s distribution amplitude @xmath55 now we can write down the helicity amplitude @xmath56 from the helicity amplitude in eq.[eq1 ] , the branching ratio reads @xmath57 is the c.m .",
    "momentum and @xmath58 is the lifetime of @xmath59 meson .    for numerical analysis , we use the following input parameters@xcite :    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     using the @xmath60 , branching ratios are @xmath61 we can see that the branching ratios of these decays are very sensitive to the possible presence of the admixture of right hand current",
    ". comparing with the sm predictions , these decays are enhanced .",
    "the numerical results are displayed as an illustration in fig.3 .",
    "we have studied the radiative annihilation decays @xmath62 @xmath1 within the framework of qcd factorization approach .",
    "physically , the factorization method is applicable because the transverse size of @xmath6 is small in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we have shown that the non - factorizable radiative corrections at order @xmath63 change the magnitude significantly compared to the leading - order result corresponding to the naive factorization . in naive factorization , we find @xmath64 and @xmath65 which are much larger than @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the framework of qcd factorization at order of @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these decays involve simpler hadronic dynamics than two - body b non - leptonic decays .",
    "experimental measurements would be very useful for understanding the mechanics of @xmath6 productions and testing the factorization frameworks .",
    "simultaneously these decays also are the background for the interesting decays @xmath69 . on the other hand",
    ", these decays may be sensitive to new physics . as an illustration",
    ", we have investigated the effects of the admixture of right - hand currents .",
    "we find that these decays are sensitive to admixture of the right - handed ( @xmath70 ) current and the effect of the admixture of right - handed ( @xmath71 ) current is negligible small .",
