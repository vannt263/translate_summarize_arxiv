    "there is growing concern in the numerical relativity community about the accuracy that can be achieved as robust implementations of the einstein equations become available .",
    "as has been discussed a number of times , the simulation of strongly gravitating astrophysical systems in 3d requires the stable and accurate handling of a large range of time and length scales  @xcite . in the context of finite difference schemes ,",
    "increasing resolution by using more grid points in a uniform grid quickly becomes prohibitively expensive , particularly with multiple spatial dimensions .",
    "two ways of achieving better accuracy include ( i ) the use of higher order methods for derivative approximations and time integration , and ( ii ) the use of a grid hierarchy which adapts to provide resolution only where and when needed , so called _ adaptive mesh refinement _ ( amr ) . both strategies have been adopted by the community largely following two independent paths . on one hand higher derivative operators are being introduced @xcite and on the other amr techniques within a second order accurate implementation have been adopted for over a decade @xcite .",
    "( for recent efforts implementing second order amr / fmr see for instance @xcite/@xcite )    one key reason behind these independent developments lies in the complications encountered when implementing amr techniques , especially related to the way the ( artificial ) interface boundaries are treated .",
    "special care must be taken when dealing with the conditions at these boundaries , in particular how derivative operators should be modified near them . in the case of second order accurate implementations",
    ", there is little ambiguity on what these modifications can be as they need only be done at interface points . for higher order implementations ,",
    "the strategy is far less clear .",
    "however , there are strong reasons to combine amr and implementations of higher orders . for instance , although higher order operators ( be they within finite difference , finite elements or spectral approximations ) do in principle provide an approximation with errors which are considerably smaller , they do so only if the underlying solution involved is well resolved by the adopted grid .",
    "certainly , the required grid can be anticipated for linear problems but this is hardly the case in non - linear ones where finer features induced by the non - linear nature of the problem can appear during the evolution .",
    "hence , an adaptive gridding mechanism which reacts to the solution itself is crucial .",
    "the combination of amr with higher order operators then provides lower errors for a given grid while being able to react to unanticipated features in the solution in addition to providing a more efficient use of computational resources.    in order to combine these techniques , one must face how to treat the derivative operators near boundaries , and how to deal with the artificial boundaries themselves . a clean way to approach",
    "this problem is to consider operators satisfying summation by parts ( sbp ) which have recently been incorporated successfully in strongly / symmetric hyperbolic systems in numerical relativity  @xcite .",
    "these techniques guarantee that a large set of problems can be implemented stably .    having stability of the unigrid evolution , however , is not sufficient to guarantee a fully discrete energy estimate for an amr implementation .",
    "the analysis of the time integration , in particular how different grids communicate with each other to provide boundary conditions , becomes quite involved .",
    "nevertheless , one can argue strongly for adopting as a starting point an implementation in which a semi - discrete estimate is guaranteed since a necessary condition for an amr implementation to be stable is that its unigrid version be stable . as discussed in the literature , the latter",
    "is guaranteed when employing runge kutta operators of orders higher than 2 @xcite ( in conjunction with suitable boundary conditions ) .",
    "we thus adopt a strategy where spatial derivative operators satisfying sbp , along with runge kutta time integrators , are employed on all levels of the amr hierarchy .",
    "this choice , of course , does not dictate the treatment of the interface boundaries , and we consider various options for this treatment .",
    "for instance , in the standard berger ",
    "oliger strategy , the solution obtained at a parent grid is employed to define boundary conditions for the child grid . leaving the stability issue aside for a moment",
    ", an immediate observation is that when employing a two - level implementation , this strategy can not generically give better accuracy than second order if boundary values are obtained by linear interpolation in time of the parent grid values .",
    "additionally , the definition of all field values via interpolation without regard for their propagation features is a likely source of inconsistencies making stability a delicate issue .    in this work",
    "we examine alternative treatments of grid boundaries and derivative operators to deal with these issues .",
    "we pay particular attention to the stability of the system by effectively implementing a toy model problem within a fixed two - grid hierarchy and analyzing the spectrum of the overall update operator .",
    "these studies demonstrate that implementations with accuracy orders greater than two , employing the standard berger ",
    "oliger scheme have unstable modes .",
    "furthermore , related schemes share this unfortunate feature . this instability can be remedied , with some caveats , with the addition of dissipation though at the expense of larger errors in the approximation . additionally , we observe that a simple modification of the standard strategy yields a stable scheme without requiring the addition of dissipation , albeit at additional computational cost . in this new strategy ,",
    "a child grid effectively never requires boundary points from a parent .",
    "this can be achieved if the solution at level @xmath0 is obtained by integrating using the past domain of dependence of the child grid only . at first sight",
    "this is more computationally demanding as it requires the area of the child grid at level @xmath1 to be larger than that at @xmath0 so that the intersection of the numerical domain of dependence of the solution at the level @xmath0 is completely contained in the refined region at level @xmath1 .",
    "this is achieved simply by defining an ` extended ' child grid at level @xmath1 and discarding a buffer zone at level @xmath0 .",
    "as we will see later in appendix  [ sec : cost ] , this extra cost need not be relevant at all , as for a given target error , a coarser base grid treated this way might be comparable to a finer base grid treated with the standard berger ",
    "oliger scheme plus the addition of dissipation .",
    "this work is divided as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : technique ] , we detail different boundary treatments and describe our method to assess their stability properties . in section",
    "[ sec : tests ] , we present one and three dimensional tests which illustrate the behavior observed . section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes with some final comments , and we defer to appendix [ sec : cost ] the discussion of the cost associated with 2nd vs. 4th order implementations .",
    "in searching for a stable amr implementation , a basic requirement is to have a stable implementation of the equations in the uniform grid case .",
    "this requirement is perhaps the most important building block , without which an amr implementation will suffer even more in terms of stability .",
    "unfortunately , even when ensuring the unigrid scheme is stable , no results are available on what guarantees the stability of an amr / fmr implementation with ` sub - cycling ' for arbitrary accuracy orders . such a scheme which advances a grid with a time step defined by its grid spacing stands in contrast to one which advances all points by a global time step determined by the finest resolution in use . the latter is considerably less efficient than the former ( becoming more so with more refinement levels ) but is simpler to analyze .",
    "we concentrate here on the former case , i.e. one that involves sub - cycling , as this is the method one would like to employ .    in order to develop a stable amr / fmr scheme ,",
    "we analyze different natural options from their fully - discrete point of view and study their stability properties .",
    "we begin by adopting a strategy that ensures stability for a uniform grid case for first order ( non - constant coefficient ) symmetric hyperbolic linear systems .",
    "this strategy calls for employing derivative operators satisfying `` summation by parts '' ( sbp ) together with an appropriate time integrator such as 3rd/4th order runge ",
    "kutta schemes@xcite .",
    "the first ingredient allows one to derive a semidiscrete energy estimate while the second one guarantees this estimate will be preserved in the fully discrete case . following this strategy ,",
    "we employ such operators here as our main building blocks ; as mentioned above , they provide a strong platform for developing a useful amr / fmr prescription .",
    "having defined the constituents of the basic update routine , we now turn our attention to the creation and update of a child grid and how updated field values on this grid are to affect those in the parent one .",
    "our goal is to obtain a recipe that will allow us to distinguish among different possibilities , the ones that guarantee stability for a simple model problem .",
    "as we will show , even when applied to a simple model problem , the analysis we present does well at predicting either stability or instability , suggesting applicability for more general problems .",
    "although our analysis applies to a simple model problem , the scheme it reveals to be stable is one that will naturally yield a stable scheme if it is so for a unigrid implementation . since the adoption of operators satisfying sbp together with an appropriate runge ",
    "kutta update scheme guarantees stability for generic non - constant coefficients first order linear systems@xcite , the higher order amr scheme will preserve this property .    to fix ideas and to simplify the presentation of our analysis",
    ", we restrict to the case where second and fourth order accurate schemes are employed .",
    "this is sufficient to illustrate the salient aspects of the analysis and main results ; the conclusion can be trivially extended to arbitrary orders of accuracy .      in order to explore different possible ways to implement an amr strategy we analyze what a full discrete step involves for the simple equation @xmath2 on the region @xmath3 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions , and where a refined region ( the child grid ) is included within this domain .",
    "this can be assumed without loss of generality as the operators employed ( satisfying sbp ) and a suitable runge kutta time update ( together with suitable boundary conditions ) guarantee the stability of the implementation .",
    "thus , to avoid unnecessary clutter in the analysis we examine the periodic case for the coarsest grid involved . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the case of _ fixed mesh refinement _ with the child grid @xmath4 refined with respect to the parent grid .",
    "we then compute the eigenvalues of the full amplification matrix ( @xmath5 ) corresponding to the update scheme of field values on the parent level .",
    "clearly , if all the absolute values of this matrix are bounded by unity , amplification at each step is bounded by one ( i.e. modes are either kept constant or damped ) and stability follows for the problem under consideration if the matrix can be diagonalized . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is an eigenvalue with absolute value larger than unity , the amplification per step is unbounded and the algorithm is therefore unstable .",
    "since this applies already to the simplest first order problem , the conclusion that the system is unstable will naturally hold for generic ones .",
    "note that it is sufficient to consider a single refinement level ( and the corresponding coarse grid ) in this analysis , as in a generic case consisting of several child grids the total amplification matrix will be a composition of several @xmath5 matrices .",
    "the specific form of @xmath5 depends on several different ingredients .",
    "the cleanest way to construct @xmath5 is to express it as a composition of different matrices , each representing the action of an operator performing a specific task involved in the overall update strategy . for the problem under consideration , we need to consider the matrices    * @xmath6 which defines the grid values on the child level by knowing those at the coarse level , usually referred to as prolongation or interpolation .",
    "* @xmath7 and @xmath8 the derivative operators used on the parent and child grids respectively . *",
    "@xmath9 , the specific time stepping algorithm .",
    "* @xmath10 which restricts the values obtained on the child grid at the new coarse time level at appropriate points of the coarse grid ; usually referred to as restriction or injection .",
    "* @xmath11 a restriction operator which , when acting on an overall update scheme , restricts its values to the region in the coarse grid which needs no refinement .",
    "hence , @xmath12 restricts the action of any operator to the points in the coarse level which do require refinement . *",
    "@xmath13 , boundary points definition at intermediate child grid time levels which , depending on the strategy adopted , one might have to consider .",
    "an update step in a two - level scheme which takes values on the @xmath1-th level of the coarse grid ( @xmath14 ) and yields values at the @xmath0-th level ( @xmath15 ) can be expressed as @xmath16 , with : @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 the update steps on the parent and child grids .",
    "for instance , for the advection equation above , and employing a 3rd order runge kutta scheme , @xmath18 becomes ( for a periodic boundary problem ) @xmath20 the expression for @xmath19 is more delicate and depends crucially on the scheme adopted .",
    "for instance , when employing @xmath21 order derivative operators , and the standard berger - oliger strategy for treating interface boundaries , one schematically has @xmath22 with @xmath23 denoting the intermediate steps of the runge - kutta algorithm , @xmath13 the identity operator at the interior points of the child grid , but zero at interface boundaries ; @xmath24 the interpolation of field values at points on the coarse grid ( at interface boundary points ) providing values at the @xmath25-th time level required by the time stepping algorithm .",
    "the above is just an example of what a typical procedure entails as there certainly are many alternatives for the injection / prolongation , update , derivatives operators and boundary definition that will be part of the amr / fmr strategy .",
    "a partial restriction is introduced when choosing the accuracy order desired as this fixes the derivative operators at interior points ( by adopting the standard centered operators ) .",
    "however this still leaves considerable freedom related to the way derivatives are to be defined at points at , and close to , the boundaries , in addition to the definition of the interpolating operators @xmath26 to be used ( if so desired ) in defining interface boundary points , the injection and prolongation operators , etc .",
    "the analytical investigation of every option is an involved task . to reduce the number of possibilities we adopt some simplifying , yet natural and commonly used , assumptions . throughout this work we concentrate on two - level schemes .",
    "we consider interpolating operators acting only at interface boundary points and , at most , a few additional points at each side of the refined grid . as much as possible",
    "we adopt the same basic integration step for all grids to ensure that a recursive type algorithm can be easily employed .",
    "finally we concentrate on vertex - centered schemes and child grids having points lying on a coarse grid points . even with these simplifications , obtaining the eigenvalues of the amplification matrix is a cumbersome task .",
    "for this reason , we perform our investigations with the aid of a computer algebra package ( maple ) to numerically calculate the eigenvalues . to do this",
    ", we define a grid composed of @xmath27 points describing the coarse level and where @xmath28 points will be refined ( the child grid has @xmath29 points ) .",
    "we construct the matrices defined above , obtain the amplification matrix and numerically calculate the eigenvalues . since we perform these calculations for a fixed number of grid points ( though we have varied @xmath27 and @xmath30 over several values ) , a negative result ( all absolute values less or equal than unity ) does not constitute a stability proof , but certainly a positive result , ( at least one eigenvalue with larger than unity absolute value ) shows that the proposed algorithm is unstable .",
    "we can thus substantially narrow the search for likely stable ones and the tests considered in section  [ sec : tests ] lend additional strength to our analysis . as we will see , our analysis indicates a preferred option which , intuition suggests , will be stable for any problem where the unigrid case is stable . the construction of the amplification matrix proceeds in the following way .",
    "first a whole time step is taken in the coarser grid , so that we can use , if so desired , the values at the next time step to impose boundary conditions for the intermediate time steps taken on the finer grid . once the recipe to provide these boundary conditions is given and the difference operator on the finer grids chosen , the algorithm is pretty much fixed .",
    "other alternatives include not providing boundary conditions at all but rather to taper off the child grid as subsequent intermediate child time levels are obtained .",
    "additionally , one might consider other variants at the level of the interpolation order on @xmath6 , a possible averaging at the injection level , @xmath10 , or at the coarser grid , etc .",
    "we analyzed several of these options and report on their results in the following subsections .",
    "finally , as mentioned , we limit ourselves to runge - kutta time integrators of order larger than two as these are known to lead to stable schemes if the semi - discrete system is stable @xcite .      here",
    "we use a third order runge - kutta time integrator ( rk3 ) as the second - order runge - kutta method is not known to guarantee the fully - discrete stable scheme if the semi - discrete scheme is stable .",
    "the population of the finer grid , given by the operator @xmath6 , is carried out using four - point stencil interpolation ( having an @xmath31 error ) on the child grid points lying in between coarse ones and using a direct copy of field values where the grid points coincide ( see appendix b for the interpolator s specific form ) .",
    "we consider the following cases :    * * berger oliger : ( @xcite ) * here we reproduce the `` standard '' berger - oliger scheme and check its stability when used with rk3 . figure [ fig:1 ] illustrates the points involved in this scheme . here",
    "the values at the diamond points , needed for the intermediate rk steps of the finer grid ( squares ) , are obtained via linear interpolation in time employing values at the top and bottom points of the coarse grid ( circles ) .",
    "the coarse grid points are already known at the advanced time step because it takes a full time step before the fine grid is advanced .",
    "the dotted lines represent the rk steps intermediate to a full time step of the child grid . on the fine grid ,",
    "only the square points are evolved , using centered difference operators , and at the end of the cycle the values of the fine grid coincident with coarser points are _ directly injected _ into the corresponding coarse grid points . * * penalty method : * in this case , in contrast to the previous one , we pay close attention to the propagation modes defined by the equation of motion . in this simple case , the single characteristic propagates from right to left ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "thus , only boundary values at the right end of the fine grid are required .",
    "these are provided by linearly interpolating coarse field values at the top and bottom levels and used as boundary conditions in a scheme enforcing these via penalty terms as described in @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "boundary values are incorporated by modifying slightly the right hand side of the ( first order ) equations .",
    "for our test problem this results in @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the discrete derivative operator ( satisfying sbp ) employed ; @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 ( i.e. only non - zero at the right interface boundary point ) ; @xmath38 is a free parameter and @xmath39 is related to the norm / derivative operator employed in ensuring sbp is satisfied ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "+ the penalty technique provides a clean and efficient method to provide boundary values which , coupled with the use of operators satisfying sbp , guarantees the stability of the implementation .",
    "furthermore , within this approach , all points are updated and the boundary conditions are imposed via a simple addition of suitable penalty terms to the right hand side at boundary points . for these reasons it represents , at first sight , a convenient approach to handle characteristic modes within an amr / fmr implementation . as with the berger - oliger scheme , after the child grid update to the same time as the parent , field values coincident with the parent are directly copied . * * tapered boundary method : * in this case , we adopt restriction operators which effectively remove points that have been influenced by the interface boundary . in practical terms",
    ", this means that if the child grid at the advanced @xmath0 level is defined as @xmath40 \\}$ ] , the update from level @xmath1 must take place in the region @xmath41 \\}$ ] with @xmath42 given by a sufficient number of points to insure that the numerical domain of dependence of @xmath43 $ ] starting at @xmath0 is _ completely _ contained in @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "this is illustrated in fig [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the size of @xmath45 is determined by the order of accuracy of the discrete operators involved and the maximum speed of the hyperbolic problem considered .",
    "+ incidentally , note that this is not the same as an alternative approach where ghost zones populating a region around the refined region ( with values obtained via linear interpolation from the coarse values at levels @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) are defined .",
    "that approach is relatively straightforward to implement and reduces the complexity of the derivative operators employed , but does not satisfy the requirement that what is done at the boundary has no influence on the final injected point . as we will see later , this scheme also has unstable modes .",
    "the analysis of the eigenvalues of the amplification matrices corresponding to each of the three cases discussed above must be examined carefully as we are considering the fully discrete case . here a competition among the unstable modes and the possible inherent dissipation of the update scheme determines whether the eigenvalues magnitude of the full amplification matrix are indeed larger than unity . in particular , for large cfl values , the inherent dissipation grows and the eigenvalues might be bounded by unity while for smaller cfl values this might not be the case . as we are interested in establishing stability with at most an upper bound for the cfl value we have examined several possible values of cfl ( ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ) and observe when unstable modes arise . for instance , for a cfl value of @xmath46 all eigenvalues for the three approaches lie within the unit circle as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bo2_eigenv ] .",
    "however , as this value is decreased unstable modes do appear for the penalty case while not for the other two options .",
    "one can exploit the free parameter @xmath38 to alleviate the instabilities in the penalty case ( in the sense that the magnitude of the eigenvalues gets closer to unity ) but not completely remove them with the addition of artificial dissipation .",
    "additionally , it is instructive to investigate the behavior of the error as a function of position to obtain some indication of the effect the artificial boundaries have . to this end",
    ", we compute the error in the evolution of @xmath48 after a single step for each case . here the solution after a step is @xmath49 and a point - wise error calculation is straightforward to compute .",
    "the results are indicated in fig .",
    "[ o2_error ] .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> efforts to achieve better accuracy in numerical relativity have so far focused either on implementing second order accurate adaptive mesh refinement or on defining higher order accurate differences and update schemes . here , we argue for the combination , that is a higher order accurate adaptive scheme . </S>",
    "<S> this combines the power that adaptive gridding techniques provide to resolve fine scales ( in addition to a more efficient use of resources ) together with the higher accuracy furnished by higher order schemes when the solution is adequately resolved . to define a convenient higher order adaptive mesh refinement scheme </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss a few different modifications of the standard , second order accurate approach of berger and oliger . applying each of these methods to a simple model problem , we find these options have unstable modes . </S>",
    "<S> however , a novel approach to dealing with the grid boundaries introduced by the adaptivity appears stable and quite promising for the use of high order operators within an adaptive framework . </S>"
