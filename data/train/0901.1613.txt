    "blocks cluster together to form a core , and the _ solvophilic _ blocks spread outwards as a corona .",
    "a certain minimum concentration is needed for micelles to form : this is the _ critical micelle concentration _ , or cmc @xcite .",
    "these block copolymer micelles have been the subject of growing recent interest , from the points of view of both fundamental polymer physics @xcite and potential applications , particularly in drug delivery @xcite .    a closely related system , which is the subject of this paper , is a blend of block copolymer and homopolymer . here",
    ", the block copolymers may also form micelles , with the homopolymer acting as the solvent @xcite .",
    "this system is more easily controlled and better characterized than an aqueous solution of diblocks , and so is more suitable for a study of the fundamentals of micelle formation .",
    "in particular , the interaction strengths between the different components are well described by the standard @xmath2 parameter @xcite , and can be obtained from the literature @xcite .",
    "detailed experimental data are available on spherical micelle formation in these blends @xcite .",
    "these data have been modeled using scaling theories @xcite .",
    "however , whilst qualitatively reproducing the general trends seen in these systems ( for example , the increase in the micelle core radius as the homopolymer length is increased ) , scaling often fails to predict the shape or magnitude of these variations quantitatively . in this paper",
    ", we use a more microscopic approach which involves less severe approximations : _ self - consistent field theory _ ( scft ) @xcite .",
    "scft , a mean - field theory of an ensemble of flexible polymers , is probably the most successful theoretical method for the modeling of the structures formed by polymers , and provides quantitative results on polymer melts @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", the properties of micelles in copolymer / homopolymer blends have not been studied in detail , using experimentally - determined polymer properties , with scft .",
    "although a considerable body of work exists on the self - consistent field theory of micelle formation , this mostly focuses on diblocks dispersed in _ monomer _",
    "solvent @xcite or on diblock copolymer melts @xcite ( although see the paper by duque on intermediate states in micelle formation @xcite and that by monzen _",
    "@xcite on _ triblocks _ in homopolymer ) .",
    "a further motivation for the study of micelles using scft is that much previous research using this approach has concentrated on periodic structures @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , our work is a detailed test of the theory for isolated aggregates , and provides an assessment of the suitability of scft for the investigation of the self - assembly of polymers in solution and the design of macromolecules for applications .",
    "we focus on the x - ray scattering experiments of kinning , thomas and fetters @xcite , which study poly(styrene - butadiene ) diblocks in homopolystyrene .",
    "we compare our predictions with their results on the core and corona radii and the critical micelle concentration .",
    "our scft results are also compared with the scaling theory predictions of leibler , orland , wheeler and others @xcite .",
    "kinning , thomas and fetters @xcite studied blends of poly(styrene - butadiene ) diblock copolymer and polystyrene homopolymer . in order to determine the effects of the molecular weight of the polymers and the relative amounts of styrene and butadiene in the diblocks ,",
    "several samples were considered .",
    "we adopt the notation used by these authors @xcite to label the samples . as an example , a diblock sample of polystyrene molar weight 60 kg / mol and polybutadiene molar weight 10 kg / mol is referred to as sb 60/10 . a polystyrene homopolymer sample of molar weight 2.1 kg / mol is labeled 2100 ps .",
    "note that these values are quite rough : more precise molecular weights for the individual samples are tabulated in the original paper @xcite .",
    "the polymer samples are characterized by their specific volumes , the root mean square end - to - end distances of the polymer molecules , and the polystyrene - polybutadiene _ interaction energy density_. we now introduce and discuss these quantities .",
    "the specific volume of pb as a function of temperature is given empirically by @xcite @xmath3 while that of ps has been found @xcite to be @xmath4 the temperature @xmath5 is measured in degrees celsius , and is equal to @xmath6 in all experiments considered here .",
    "scft is more naturally written in terms of the volumes of individual molecules @xmath7 , with @xmath8 representing either pb or ps .",
    "these can be calculated from equations [ v_pb ] and [ v_ps ] by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the molar weight of substance @xmath8 .",
    "the polymer root - mean - square end - to - end distances are given , also empirically , by @xcite @xmath11 where the molecular weights are measured in g / mol .",
    "the work of kinning _ et al _ differs from much of the polymer literature in that it characterizes the strength of the interaction between the two polymer species via the _ interaction energy density _",
    "@xcite , rather than the corresponding @xmath2 parameter .",
    "the energy of this interaction is given by @xmath13 where the @xmath14 terms are the local volume fractions of the two polymer species at position @xmath15 .",
    "the definition of the @xmath2 parameter involves the introduction of an arbitrary reference volume @xmath16 , such as the average of the repeat unit volumes of the two polymers @xcite .",
    "however , it is always possible to write terms involving the interaction strength in such a way that the numerical value of @xmath16 need not be specified .",
    "thus @xmath12 , which requires no reference volume , is preferred by some authors . for reference , @xmath2 and @xmath12",
    "are related by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "data on the temperature dependence of the polystyrene - polybutadiene interaction energy density may be fitted by the empirical formula @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters described here ( molecular volumes , end - to - end distances and interaction energy density ) are the required input for our scft calculations .",
    "they are all determined from experiments that do not involve micelle formation ",
    "it is not necessary for any parameters specific to micellization to be measured in order to predict the structure of micelles .    to our knowledge , the only approach that has previously been used to provide detailed , system - specific predictions of micelle structure in copolymer / homopolymer blends is scaling theory . in the paper of kinning _ et al _ discussed above",
    ", the experimental data is compared with a scaling approach developed by leibler and others @xcite .",
    "like scft , this theory predicts the micelle properties from the system parameters introduced above . since scaling theory",
    "will be compared with our scft calculations later in this paper , we outline it briefly now .    scaling theory assumes that the micelle consists of two distinct and uniform regions : the core and the corona , which in turn are completely distinct from the surrounding solution .",
    "the core is taken to contain b - type ( solvophobic ) monomers mixed with a homopolymer .",
    "similarly , the corona is assumed to be composed of a - type monomers ( belonging to the copolymer molecules ) mixed with a homopolymer .",
    "the surroudings of the micelle are modeled as a homogeneous solution of homopolymer and copolymer chains .",
    "making these clear divisions between the different regions of the micelle and the surrounding polymer solution allows the free energy of a blend containing @xmath22 micelles to be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the free energy of a single micelle , @xmath25 is the free energy of mixing of the homopolymers and diblocks _ outside _ the micelles , and @xmath26 is the translational entropy of the gas of micelles .",
    "@xmath25 is calculated from the standard flory - huggins expression @xcite .",
    "the translational entropy @xmath26 is calculated from a lattice model @xcite where each lattice cell has the volume of a single micelle @xcite .",
    "the number of occupied cells is calculated from the fraction of copolymer chains that aggregate into micelles .",
    "the free energy of a single micelle @xmath24 can then be split into separate contributions as follows : @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the radius of the core and @xmath29 is the interfacial tension at the core - corona boundary .",
    "the use of this expression for the interfacial energy assumes that the interface has the same properties as the interface between two incompatible homopolymers and allows @xmath29 to be simply expressed in terms of the monomer length and the @xmath2 parameter @xcite .    the _ deformation energy _",
    "@xmath30 arises from the stretching of the copolymer chains confined to the spherical micelle .",
    "finally , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the free energies of mixing of the homopolymer with the copolymer blocks in the corona and core regions respectively . like the bulk mixing term @xmath25 in equation [ scaling_total ] ,",
    "these are assumed to be given by the flory - huggins theory of polymer blends @xcite .    to find the equilibrium state of the system , equation [ scaling_total ]",
    "is minimized , keeping the temperature and total volume fraction of copolymer fixed and allowing all other quantities ( such as the size and number of micelles ) to vary .",
    "this yields predictions for the core and corona radii , the critical micelle concentration and the composition of the various regions . in this paper",
    ", we compare our scft results with the scaling predictions of kinning _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "self - consistent field theory ( scft ) @xcite predicts the equilibrium structures formed in a melt or blend of polymers .",
    "it is a mean - field theory , neglecting composition fluctuations .",
    "the description of the polymers is coarse - grained : the configuration of an individual polymer molecule is modeled as a random walk in space @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a curve parameter specifying the position along the polymer backbone .",
    "an ensemble of many such polymers is considered .",
    "the interactions between polymers are included in two ways : by assuming that the blend is incompressible and introducing a contact potential between molecules of different species .",
    "the strength of this potential is specified by the interaction energy density @xmath12 .",
    "the first step in finding an approximation method ( scft ) for the above system is to view each molecule as being acted on by a field produced by all other molecules in the system @xcite .",
    "this transforms the @xmath35-body problem of modeling an ensemble of @xmath35 polymers into @xmath35 @xmath36-body problems .",
    "since we wish to compute the partition sum over all possible system configurations , all molecules of a given species may be treated as equivalent .",
    "therefore , we need only introduce one field @xmath37 for each species @xmath8 and have only to solve @xmath8 @xmath36-body problems .",
    "note that this involves no approximation  the complexity of the system is hidden in the field terms @xmath37 .",
    "the utility of the scft approach lies in the fact that approximations may be found more easily for the fields than for the original formulation of the problem .    for definiteness",
    ", we now focus on our diblock copolymer / homopolymer blend , and introduce fields @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 acting on the polystyrene blocks , polybutadiene blocks and homopolystyrene respectively .",
    "this converts the partition sum into an integral over field configurations , with the original hamiltonian replaced by an effective hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "following the procedure described in the recent review by matsen @xcite , we find that @xmath41 is given by @xmath42[1-\\phi_\\text{ps}(\\mathbf{r})-\\phi_\\text{hps}(\\mathbf{r})]}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{v_\\text{ps}+v_\\text{pb}}\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\,\\{w_\\text{ps}(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_\\text{ps}(\\mathbf{r})+w_\\text{pb}(\\mathbf{r})[1-\\phi_\\text{ps}(\\mathbf{r})-\\phi_\\text{hps}(\\mathbf{r})]\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{v_\\text{hps}}\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\,w_\\text{hps}(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_\\text{hps}(\\mathbf{r})-\\frac{\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{hps}v}{v_\\text{hps}}\\ln q_\\text{hps}-\\frac{(\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{ps}+\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{pb})v}{v_\\text{ps}+v_\\text{pb}}\\ln q_\\text{ps , pb } \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath43 are the local volume fractions of the various polymer species @xmath8 ( @xmath44 , pb or hps ) and @xmath45 is the total volume of the system .",
    "the terms @xmath46 are the mean volume fractions of species @xmath8 .",
    "the first term ( with prefactor @xmath47 ) describes the interaction between the different polymer species . in this term , and throughout , the polybutadiene block volume fraction @xmath48 is replaced by @xmath49 .",
    "this follows from the incompressibility of the blend : the local volume fractions must add to @xmath36 at every point .",
    "the next three terms all involve the @xmath37 , and arise from the unit operators that are inserted into the partition function to convert the partition sum into an integral over fields . in the penultimate term",
    ", @xmath50 is the partition function of a single homopolymer chain in the field @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , @xmath52 is the partition function of a single copolymer chain in the fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "these are given by ( again following the review referenced above @xcite ) @xmath55=\\int\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\,q_\\text{hps}(\\mathbf{r},s)q_\\text{hps}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r},s ) \\label{single_chain_partition}\\ ] ] where the @xmath56 and @xmath57 terms are single chain propagators @xcite .",
    "the partition function @xmath52 of a single copolymer chain is determined similarly .",
    "recall that the polymer molecules are modeled as random walks subject to an external field that incorporates their interactions with the rest of the melt .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the propagators satisfy modified diffusion equations . in the case of the homopolymer",
    ", we have @xmath58q_\\text{hps}(\\mathbf{r},s ) \\label{diffusion}\\ ] ] with initial condition @xmath59 .",
    "the copolymer propagators are computed in a similar way , with the copolymer architecture entering into the theory through the fact that the corresponding diffusion equation for the copolymer is solved with the field @xmath37 and the prefactor of the @xmath60 term appropriate to each of the two sections of the copolymer @xcite .",
    "all steps until now have been exact , and we now introduce the main approximation of scft .",
    "this consists of extremizing @xmath41 with respect to all fields @xmath37 and all densities @xmath43 , yielding a saddle - point approximation to the system partition function @xmath61 .",
    "if the polymers are long and fluctuations are weak , this method successfully isolates the dominant contribution to @xmath61 , and the predictions of scft are in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "extremizing @xmath24 produces a set of simultaneous equations linking the values of the fields and densities at the minimum . denoting these values by lower - case letters @xmath14 and @xmath62",
    ", we find @xmath63&=&\\frac{2\\lambda}{k_\\text{b}t}\\left[\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{ps}+\\overline{\\phi}_\\text{hps}-\\phi_\\text{ps}(\\mathbf{r})-\\phi_\\text{hps}(\\mathbf{r})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ w_\\text{hps}&=&\\frac{v_\\text{hps}}{v_\\text{ps}+v_\\text{pb}}w_\\text{ps}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\label{scft_equations}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the ( mean ) volume fraction of species @xmath8 .",
    "the first of these equations arises directly from the incompressibility of the melt .",
    "the homopolymer density is evaluated from the propagators ( see equation [ diffusion ] ) according to @xcite @xmath64}\\int^1_0\\mathrm{d}s\\ , q_\\text{hps}(\\mathbf{r},s)q_\\text{hps}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r},s ) \\label{density}\\ ] ] the copolymer densities are calculated similarly , with the integration limits set to give the correct proportions of each species .    in order to calculate the scft density profiles for a given set of mean volume fractions , the set of simultaneous equations [ scft_equations ] must be solved with the densities calculated as in equation [ density ] .",
    "this is achieved using a standard relaxation procedure @xcite . to begin",
    ", we make a guess for the form of the fields @xmath62 and solve the diffusion equations to calculate the propagators and hence the densities corresponding to these fields ( see equations [ diffusion ] and [ density ] ) .",
    "new values for the fields are now calculated using the new @xmath14 .",
    "however , if we then recalculate the densities with these new @xmath65 , we find that the relaxation algorithm becomes unstable . to avoid this problem ,",
    "we ( heavily ) damp the iteration , replacing the @xmath62 with a mixture of the old and new values ( @xmath66 ) and then calculate the @xmath67 .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the difference between the left and right hand sides of equations [ scft_equations ] is less than @xmath68 . for several systems , we have confirmed that the iteration converges to the same solution for different initial guesses for the @xmath65 .",
    "since we focus on isolated spherical micelles , the diffusion equations themselves are solved in a spherically - symmetric geometry . reflecting boundary conditions are imposed at the origin and at the boundary of the system .",
    "a finite difference method @xcite is used to generate approximate numerical solutions to the diffusion equations .",
    "the calculations are performed in real space , in contrast to much of the scft literature @xcite .",
    "a step size of @xmath69 is used .",
    "it has been checked that using a finer grid does not significantly change the @xmath14 .    in the above discussion",
    ", we considered a simple system of fixed volume and fixed copolymer volume fraction containing one micelle . to find the micelle with the lowest free energy , we must consider how a system of many micelles minimizes its free energy .",
    "consider a macroscopic copolymer / homopolymer blend whose copolymer volume fraction @xmath70 , total volume @xmath71 and temperature @xmath5 are all fixed .",
    "the equilibrium state of this system can be found by minimizing the total free energy @xmath24 .",
    "if the copolymer concentration is above a certain value ( the _ critical micelle concentration _ ) , copolymer chains can either exist as monomers or in micelles .",
    "the number density of micelles is thus an internal degree of freedom and the macroscopic system varies this quantity ( subject to the constraint of fixed copolymer volume fraction ) in order to minimize the free energy .",
    "explicit calculations on this many - micelle macrosopic system are extremely time - consuming even using scft .",
    "however , we can reduce the problem to one involving only a single micelle if we neglect inter - micellar interactions and the translational entropy of the micelles .",
    "the former is applicable if the micellar solution is sufficiently dilute while the latter introduces a ( small ) correction term to the free energy which will be included by hand later in this section . in this case",
    ", we can reduce the many - micelle system to a one - micelle system of volume @xmath45 and copolymer volume fraction @xmath70 , where @xmath45 corresponds to the volume per micelle .",
    "we can then effectively vary the number density of micelles by varying @xmath45 .",
    "specifically , if the free energy of this subsystem is @xmath72 , the total free energy of the macroscopic system is given by @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath71 is fixed , we can find the equilibrium state of the whole system by minimizing the free energy density @xmath74 with respect to @xmath45 . in the appendix ,",
    "we show using a simple two state model that this procedure automatically yields the optimum micelle , that is the micelle with the lowest free energy per chain@xcite .    to our knowledge , this method of varying the size of the calculation box containing a single micelle in order to obtain information on a system of many micelles has not been used before : in earlier work , the box size is fixed @xcite .",
    "although having to minimize @xmath75 with respect to @xmath45 for each system parameter adds to the numerical burden of the calculation , the advantage of this method is that , by minimizing the free energy density , we avoid the awkward problem of trying to define the free energy per chain in the micelle , which is the basic quantity in simple theories of micellization @xcite .",
    "taking this latter approach would involve making ad hoc definitions concerning the boundary of the micelle in what is essentially a continuum calculation .",
    "another advantage of our approach is that it yields a well - defined value for the volume occupied by a micelle .",
    "this allows us to take into account the translational entropy of spherical micelles@xcite .",
    "an estimate of the translational entropy per micelle can be obtained from a simple lattice model where the system is divided into cells of the volume of a single micelle .",
    "we adapt the results of mayes and de la cruz @xcite and leibler @xcite and find that the translational entropy per micelle is @xmath76\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the volume of the micelle and @xmath45 is the volume of the subsystem containing the micelle .",
    "note that the lattice model leading to equation [ trans entropy ] implicitly assumes that micelles are impenetrable .",
    "equation [ trans entropy ] thus also partially corrects for inter - micellar interactions which were neglected in the preceding discussion .",
    "to estimate the micelle volume , we use the working definitions of the core radius @xmath0 and the corona thickness @xmath1 explained in the next section ; @xmath77 can then be calculated directly from @xmath78 .",
    "we now have all the necessary techniques to calculate the optimum micelle for each system parameter .",
    "to begin , we perform an scft calculation at fixed subsystem volume , giving the density profile of a micelle and the free energy density of the subsystem .",
    "we then adjust the subsystem volume",
    ". this is achieved by changing the number of points on the grid on which we solve the diffusion equations whilst keeping the grid step size constant .",
    "this is repeated until we have located the minimum of the free energy density for the geometry under consideration .",
    "this procedure yields the density profile of the micelle with the minimum free energy per chain @xmath79 .",
    "as shown in the appendix , it also results in the chemical potential of bulk copolymers outside the micelle being equal to @xmath80 .",
    "our approach therefore also allows us to estimate the critical micelle concentration ( more accurately the critical micelle volume fraction ) which we define via the equation @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the bulk copolymer concentration that coexists with the micelle at total copolymer fraction @xmath83 .",
    "note that , in the original definition @xcite , @xmath82 is the total volume fraction of copolymers that exist as isolated molecules , rather than the bulk copolymer concentration that coexists with the micelle .",
    "however , provided the micelles are well - separated , these two quantities are very close and we shall treat them as equivalent . strictly speaking , in the above definition for @xmath84 , we should also use the bulk copolymer concentration _ at cmc _ rather than at @xmath83 .",
    "this is because the cmc is defined as the value of @xmath83 where the volume fraction of micelles equals the volume fraction of bulk copolymer .",
    "however in practice using the bulk copolymer fraction at @xmath83 rather than at cmc yields a very good approximation for @xmath84 since the bulk copolymer volume fraction remains pinned close to the cmc value for @xmath85 .",
    "this is most readily illustrated using a simple bimodal model for micelle formation where we assume that copolymers can exist either as single molecules or as micelles with the optimum aggregation number @xmath86 @xcite . denoting the micelle and single molecule fraction at @xmath83 as @xmath87 and @xmath82 respectively and",
    "the micelle and single molecule fraction at @xmath84 as @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively , it is easy to show that for @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath86 is typically large , the volume fraction of copolymers outside the micelle remains pinned close to its cmc value . for comparison with experimental data , @xmath84 is converted to weight fraction using specific volumes ( equations [ v_pb ] and [ v_ps ] ) .    in the results presented in next section , the core and corona thicknesses of the spherical micelle",
    "are calculated at 10% weight fraction of copolymer , i.e. , the weight fraction used in the original experiments @xcite .",
    "however the cmc values are calculated at 2.5% weight fraction of copolymer . for the copolymers with the lighter core blocks",
    "( sb 10/10 , sb 40/10 ) , the choice of weight fraction makes relatively little difference to the calculated cmc , as we would expect from the argument in the previous paragraph .",
    "however for the copolymers with the heavier core block ( sb 20/20 ) , we need to use the dilute ( 2.5% weight fraction ) system in order for the copolymer concentration to have reached a constant value at the edge of the system .",
    "decreasing the copolymer weight fraction further has only a very small effect on our prediction for the cmc .",
    "we begin by comparing our predictions for the core radii and corona thicknesses with experiment and scaling theory for a variety of poly(styrene - butadiene)/homopolystyrene blends . in contrast to scaling theory , the borders between the core , corona and bulk regions are not perfectly sharp in scft , and we require working definitions of the core radius @xmath28 and corona thickness @xmath92 . we define the core radius as that at which the volume fractions of the solvophobic and solvophilic blocks are equal : @xmath93 .",
    "other definitions , such as @xmath94 @xcite are equally valid . however , since the boundaries are quite sharp , the difference between the two definitions for a given system is quite small ( see [ cross_section_fig ] ) .",

    "full line : volume fraction profile for pb blocks ; dashed line : ps ; dotted line : homopolystyrene .",
    "the core radius @xmath28 and the corona thickness @xmath92 are also marked . ]",
    "the main panel shows a comparison of scft predictions with experiment and scaling at @xmath6 and copolymer weight fraction @xmath96 for core radii @xmath28 , as a function of homopolystyrene molecular weight .",
    "the data in the top left are for copolymers sb 20/20 ; those in the bottom right are for sb 40/10 .",
    "the inset shows corona thickness @xmath92 as a function of homopolystyrene molecular weight for sb 20/20 . in both the main panel and the inset , solid lines with circles",
    "show experimental results , dashed lines with squares show scft predictions and dotted lines with crosses show scaling . ]    in contrast , the corona is very diffuse ( see [ cross_section_fig ] ) , and it is less clear how to define its outer boundary .",
    "to proceed , we calculate the radius of gyration of the corona from @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the bulk polystyrene concentration which must be removed to isolate the corona .",
    "we now calculate the thickness @xmath92 of the hollow sphere with inner radius @xmath28 ( the core radius as defined above ) which has the same radius of gyration as the corona .",
    "this is taken as an estimate of the corona thickness .",
    "@xmath92 is related to @xmath28 and @xmath99 by @xcite @xmath100 and can be determined numerically .",
    "we now examine the effect of homopolymer molecular weight on core and corona size for the samples sb 20/20 and sb 40/10 @xcite .",
    "the experimental data ( alongside scaling theory and our scft predictions ) are shown in [ coremhps_fig ] as a plot of the logarithm of the core radius against the logarithm of the homopolymer molecular weight . as the homopolystyrene molecular weight",
    "is decreased at a fixed polystyrene block molecular weight , we see that the corona thickness increases and the core radius decreases .",
    "this is because decreasing homopolystyrene length leads the entropy of mixing between the homopolystyrene and the polystyrene block to increase , increasing the tendency of the homopolystyrene volume fraction profile to be uniform .",
    "this can be achieved by making the corona region larger and the core smaller @xcite .",
    "these data also show the effect of core block molecular weight : if a copolymer with a larger pb block ( sb 20/20 rather than sb 40/10 ) is used , the core radius is naturally larger .",
    "the shape of these experimentally - observed trends are reproduced much more accurately by scft ( see [ coremhps_fig ] ) compared to scaling theory , where the predicted variation of @xmath0 with @xmath101 is too shallow . on the other hand for both sb 20/20 and sb 40/10 , scft overestimates",
    "@xmath0 by about 20 - 30% ; this discrepancy is comparable to that found in scaling theory .",
    "however , we emphasize that our calculations contain no adjustable parameters : all the required input concerning polymer properties ( such as the interaction density @xmath12 ) has been determined from experiments that do not involve micelle formation .",
    "given this fact , we believe that the agreement between scft and experiment for @xmath0 is good .    with our corona definition , scft reproduces the experimentally observed fall in corona thickness as the homopolymer molecular weight is increased for the sample sb 20/20 ( see inset to [ coremhps_fig ] ) .",
    "however both scft and scaling theory predict a variation of @xmath1 with @xmath101 that is too shallow . in terms of the magnitude of @xmath1 , scaling theory is marginally more accurate compared to scft , though the difference between either scft or scaling theory with experiment is small .",
    "we also note that the corona is very diffuse and its radius is measured in experiments by an indirect procedure ( it is inferred from the inter - particle interactions ) @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the corona thickness do not therefore constitute as stringent a test of the theory as those of the core radius .    in terms of the variation of @xmath0 or @xmath1 with @xmath101 ,",
    "experimental data are available for heavier copolymers ( sb 80/80 ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately we have not been able to test scft for this system because @xmath102 is too high and the core density profile too sharp so that our extremization procedure becomes unreliable due to numerical errors .",
    "next , we consider the dependence of the core radius on the polystyrene block molecular weight ( rather than the homopolystyrene weight considered above ) . as",
    "before , the scft predictions , scaling theory and experimental data are shown in a log - log plot ( [ coremps_fig ] ) .",
    "the pb block molar weight is fixed at approximately 10 kg / mol , whilst the ps block molar weight is increased from around 10 kg / mol to 60 kg / mol .",
    "the homopolymer is always 7400ps . from the experimental data ,",
    "the pb core is seen to shrink as the ps block molecular weight is increased .",
    "this behavior can be understood ( see the explanation given above ) by considering the effect of the polystyrene molecular block weight ( this time at fixed homopolystyrene weight ) on the entropy of mixing outside the core @xcite .    for the scft curve",
    "labeled `` scft 1 '' , the pb block molar weight for each copolymer sample is fixed at the value quoted in the original paper@xcite , i.e. , the copolymer samples considered in [ coremps_fig ] do not all have the same pb block molar weight , but instead have a range of molar weights in the region of 10 kg / mol . in this case",
    ", scft does not predict the shape of @xmath0 vs @xmath103 very well .",
    "in particular the predicted @xmath0 is no longer a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath103 .",
    "the scatter in the scft points comes from the fact that within scft , @xmath0 is very sensitive to the exact molecular weight of the core block so any scatter in the input pb block weight is amplified in the final @xmath0 results .",
    "in particular , the sample sb 23/10 ( the second point in [ coremps_fig ] ) has the rather lower value of 9 kg / mol which leads to an apparent minima in the @xmath0 values .",
    "if on the other hand we fix the core block for all the samples to be 10 kg / mol , we obtain the curve labeled `` scft 2 '' which now predicts the shape of @xmath0 vs @xmath103 much more accurately .",
    "in fact , fixing the pb block weight of all the samples to be 10 kg / mol lies well within the experimental accuracy of the measured molecular weights since the polydispersity for all the copolymer samples can be as high as @xmath104 @xcite which translates to an uncertainty in the molecular weight of @xmath105 ( recall @xcite that @xmath106 ) .",
    "we note that the curve scft2 predicts the shape of @xmath0 vs @xmath103 much more accurately than scaling theory , where the predicted variation of @xmath0 with @xmath103 is too shallow .",
    "however as before , scft overestimates @xmath0 by about 30% , similar to scaling theory .",
    "we now move to the dependence of the core radius and corona thickness on the overall copolymer molecular weight for _ symmetric _ copolymers .",
    "we consider the samples sb 10/10 and sb 20/20 in 7400ps homopolymer , and , as before , show experimental , scaling @xcite and scft results in a log - log plot ( [ corempb_fig ] ) .",
    "as would be expected , the core radius and corona thickness both increase as the molecular weight of the symmetric diblocks is increased .",
    "for the available points , both scft and scaling theory predict the slope of @xmath0 vs @xmath107 well .",
    "however both theories once again overestimate the magnitude of @xmath0 , though scaling theory is marginally more accurate than scft in this case .",
    "the situation is reversed for the corona thickness ( inset of [ corempb_fig ] ) where scft is marginally more accurate than scaling theory .",

    "however , for the copolymer sample with the longest solvophobic block ( sb 20/20 ) , the scft values for the cmc are very low and are in fact inferior to those predicted by scaling theory ( see inset to [ cmc_fig ] ) .",

    "wijmans and linse argued that this was due to the effect of the mean - field approximation on the bulk chemical potential .",
    "the argument is as follows @xcite . in mean - field theory , the effect of compositional fluctuations where an individual copolymer interacts with itself are neglected , so that a copolymer in the bulk region interacts almost exclusively with the solvent .",
    "the solvophobic b section of the copolymer therefore interacts largely with the a solvent , and the number of repulsive contacts is very high .",
    "however , in monte carlo simulations or experiment , the b block minimizes contact with the solvent by collapsing into a globule , so that the number of repulsive interactions is smaller than that predicted by mean - field theory .",
    "this means that the bulk phase is more energetically unfavorable in scft , and micelle formation is hence more favorable in comparison .",
    "the cmc is therefore underestimated by scft .",
    "if the above argument is correct , we would expect the disagreement to worsen sharply when we consider polymers with longer solvophobic blocks .",
    "this is indeed seen for sb 20/20 .",
    "interestingly , the agreement between scaling theory and experiment for sb 20/20 is not as bad , despite the fact that a mean field flory - huggins model is employed for the bulk free energy @xcite ( see the inset to [ cmc_fig ] ) .",
    "we speculate that the better agreement may be due to a fortuitous cancellation of errors due to the approximate nature of the free energy used in scaling theory for both the micelle and the bulk .",
    "in contrast , we expect the scft free energy to be very accurate for the micelle ( as evidenced by the excellent agreement of core dimensions ) but significantly poorer for the bulk for the reasons explained in the previous paragraph .    by plotting density profiles of the micelles for the sb 20/20 and sb 40/10 samples blended with the heaviest and lightest homopolymers considered in the experiments",

    "the volume fraction profiles of the core pb blocks , corona ps blocks and homopolystyrene are shown by full lines , dashed lines and dotted lines respectively .",
    "for this system , the small homopolymer has a high entropy of mixing with the polystyrene corona .",
    "this means that the corona is strongly swollen by the homopolymer , and the core shrinks to compensate @xcite .",
    "the opposite extreme may be seen in panel ( b ) of [ cuts - ex ] , where cuts are shown through the volume fraction profile of a micelle in a blend of sb 40/10 copolymer with the heavy homopolymer 35000ps . here , the large homopolystyrene molecules mix much less well with the corona ps blocks , and the volume fraction of homopolymer in the corona region is much lower .",

    "we note however that our calculations contain no adjustable parameters .",
    "given this fact , we believe that the agreement between scft and experiment for @xmath0 is good . since the core radius is the quantity most accurately measured experimentally , the success of scft here is clear validation of the use of this approach to model micelle formation in block copolymer / homopolymer blends . for the corona thickness @xmath1 , we find that the accuracy of our scft results is at least as good as those of scaling theory",

    "the predictions improve on scaling theory by around an order of magnitude . for heavier core blocks ,",
