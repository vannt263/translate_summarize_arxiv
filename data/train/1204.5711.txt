    "the formation of planets remains one of the most challenging problems of contemporary astrophysics .",
    "the current paradigm in planet formation theory describes a hierarchical growth of solid bodies , from interstellar dust grains to rocky planetary cores .",
    "a particularly difficult phase in the process is the growth from centimeter sized pebbles and meter - sized boulders to planetary embryos the size of our moon or mars .",
    "objects in the pebble to boulder range are expected to drift inward extremely rapidly in a protoplanetary disk , so that they would generally fall into the central star well before larger bodies can form by simple accumulation @xcite .",
    "ways to bypass this problem have focused on inhomogeneities in the flow , in order to trap particles in their migrating path .",
    "@xcite proposed a model in which mm - sized particles are trapped in the smallest eddies in the flow , forming `` sandpile '' planetesimals in the 10 - 100 km range ( though that model has been criticized by and @xcite )",
    ". particles may also be trapped in mesoscale `` zonal flows '' @xcite that are local inversions in the angular velocity profile , brought about by spatial variations in magnetic pressure .",
    "the particles themselves can give rise to the necessary inhomogeneities , as their migrating streaming flow develops into a traffic - jam instability , leading to intense particle clumping and subsequent planetesimal formation at the ceres - mass range @xcite .",
    "it has also been recently proposed that icy planetesimals may form from direct coagulation @xcite due to the enhanced sticking properties of ices .",
    "another process has been suggested , that combines several of the advantages ( as well as many of the problems ) of the scenarios described above , and is the subject of this work .",
    "turbulence in the largest scales of the flow , in the form of large scale vortices , has been independently proposed by and @xcite as fast routes for planet formation , for two main reasons .",
    "first , vortices are equilibrium solutions of the navier - stokes equations , and thus are persistent structures in hydrodynamic flows , as seen in the great red spot of jupiter , a remarkable high pressure vortex stable since first spotted , over three hundred years ago @xcite .",
    "the second is that the equilibrium is geostrophic , i.e , between the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force .",
    "as solids do not feel the pressure force , the coriolis force will lead them out of the vortex if cyclonic and into the eye if anticyclonic . as the shear enforces that only anticyclonic vortices persist ,",
    "this becomes a very effective mechanism to concentrate solid particles @xcite , as also observed in numerical simulations .",
    "it was further shown by @xcite that in the limit where turbulence in the vortex core is absent and the fragmentation of particles is ignored , the concentration of solids easily reaches the conditions necessary to gravitationally collapse them into planets .",
    "nevertheless , as exciting as the vortex hypothesis may be , for a long time no plausible mechanism for the formation and sustenance of such storm systems in disks could be found .",
    "it is well known that three - dimensional vortices fall prey to elliptical instabilities , a general name given to parasitic instabilities of closed elliptical streamlines ( see e.g. the review of * ? ? ?",
    "fluids in rigid rotation support a spectrum of stable inertial waves , the simplest ones being circularly polarized transverse plane waves oscillating at twice the base frequency ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "strain is introduced when the motion passes from circular to elliptical , and some three - dimensional modes find resonance with the underlying strain field .",
    "because of its intrinsic three - dimensional character , the absence of elliptic instability modifies the turbulent energy cascade from direct to inverse in 2d @xcite .",
    "the result is that the series of viscous mergings that turn small and mesoscale eddies into large vortices in the integral scale is not expected to occur in systems that significantly depart from two - dimensionality . in other words",
    ", vortices do not spontaneously develop in three dimensions from initial small scale noise as they do in two dimensions , and must therefore be the result of some instability . because the keplerian shear provides stabilization of linear axisymmetric disturbances at all reynolds numbers ( rayleigh criterion ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in non - magnetized disks any such instability must be either non - axisymmetric , non - linear , or rely on a modification of the angular velocity profile to circumvent the stabilizing effect of the shear .    based on these ideas ,",
    "two main processes have been proposed for the formation of vortices in disks .",
    "one is the non - linear radial convection process that has been referred to as global baroclinic instability , subcritical baroclinic instability , and simply baroclinic instability .",
    "this shall not be dealt with in this barotropic paper .",
    "we will focus here on what has become known as rossby wave instability ( rwi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rwi relies on a modification of the angular velocity profile , brought about by a local extremum of an entropy - modified potential vorticity quantity ( or simply the potential vorticity in the case of a barotropic flow ) .",
    "the extremum in potential vorticity launches inertial - acoustic waves , akin to rossby waves in planetary atmospheres , and traps modes in its co - rotational singularity ( see fig 1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mechanism was first discussed by in the context of self - gravitating galactic disks , and mentioned en passant by @xcite , who called them `` edge modes '' .",
    "the instability was discussed again by in the context of so - called `` slender torus '' models , hot disks around quasars modeled locally in radius .",
    "the first non - linear numerical simulation of the instability , done by @xcite , found that the trapped non - axisymmetric modes evolved into anticyclonic vortices , but could not follow the calculation until full saturation .",
    "the interest on the instability waned after the re - discovery of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) by and its rise to paradigmatic status as the source of angular momentum transport and turbulence in disks .",
    "the rwi was re - analyzed by @xcite , who expanded the linear analysis of to non - barotropic disks , and gave the mechanism its modern name .",
    "subsequent work showed that a localized bump in surface density or pressure would cause the instability @xcite , and numerical simulations @xcite confirmed its saturation into vortices , with most unstable azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath1=4 - 5 .",
    "raised the possibility that such surface density jumps would naturally occur at the boundaries between the magnetized and unmagnetized regions of accretion disks . in this boundary , because the unmagnetized region constitutes a `` dead zone '' to the mri @xcite , there exists a transition in turbulent viscosity .",
    "the viscous torque at the transition has a component proportional to the negative of the viscosity gradient , so material is accelerated outward in the inner dead zone boundary ( negative viscous gradient ) and inward in the outer dead zone boundary ( positive viscous gradient ) .",
    "this modifies the potential vorticity profile at these transitions , triggering the rwi . because this component of the viscous torque is also proportional to the shear rate",
    ", this process occurs at the shear timescale , not on the much longer viscous timescale .",
    "this two - dimensional scenario , modeling the turbulent transition as jumps in alpha - viscosity was used by to argue for accumulation of particles in that region , and by @xcite to demonstrate their collapse into planets .",
    "the test of this scenario in three - dimensional , magneto - hydrodynamical calculations has yet to be performed .",
    "that is the goal of this paper .    in particular , we focus on three questions . first , whether the rwi will drive angular momentum transport .",
    "previous works show that although turbulence in the active upper layers drives waves that propagate into the dead zone , the amount of stress generated is too low to drive significant angular momentum transport , due to the low inertia of the upper active layers . in this work",
    "we investigate the effect of a radial , not vertical , resistive transition . as in the midplane",
    "the densities are much higher , perhaps the degree of angular momentum transport changes significantly . moreover ,",
    "strong anti - cyclonic vortices provide an exciting possibility .",
    "vorticity generates spiral density waves that would have the right velocity correlation to transport angular momentum outwards .",
    "it has been shown in local models of unmagnetized disks that by radiation of waves , vortices can maintain a relatively high accretion rate , at the level of @xmath2 .",
    "showed proof - of - concept alpha - disk models that the dead zone can be `` revived '' by vortices excited in the active / dead boundary , but that still has to be confirmed by mhd simulations .",
    "the second question pertains to the width of the transition .",
    "lyra et al .",
    "( 2009 ; see also regly et al .",
    "2012 ) show that the maximum width where one expects a pressure bump to trigger the rwi is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pressure scale height .",
    "the outer edge of the dead zone undergoes a gradual transition , where the density falls monotonically , until the point that it gets so thin that ionizing agents ( stellar x - rays or external cosmic rays ) can penetrate all the way to the midplane . as this transition should be very smooth , extending through tens of au",
    ", we can exclude that as a possible location for rwi excitation . the inner edge , on the other hand , houses a more exciting possibility , since there the transition in ionization is sharp , set by the collisional ionization of potassium , that occurs at @xmath5 .",
    "the other question is whether the magnetic field would in any way inhibit the growth of the rwi .",
    "@xcite find that a density bump develops at the inner edge of the dead zone , but in the timespan of their simulation , no appreciable growth of non - axisymmetric modes is observed . the same negative result is found in the models of @xcite who model inhomogeneous mri , mimicking the effects of a dead zone .",
    "this is curious , since non - axisymmetric modes trapped in the pressure bump should develop counter - rotation , as the fluid element ahead of the bump is accelerated , and the fluid element behind it is decelerated @xcite .",
    "these negative results could be due to the limited azimuthal extent modeled by both works ( @xmath6 by @xcite , local box in the works of @xcite ) , of stratification in the case of @xcite , or inhibition by the magnetic field .",
    "although vortices have been reported in mri - active disks , the magneto - elliptic instability was shown by to be powerful enough to disrupt vortices otherwise stable in non - magnetized environments . in this work we present models where the dead zone is modeled by a resistive jump in a magnetized disk , and show that the rwi is excited at the dead side of the transition , leading to a giant vortex that survives until the end of the simulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect  2",
    "we present the model equations , and in sect  3 the initial conditions .",
    "the results are shown in sect  4 , followed by a discussion and conclusions in sect  5 .",
    "we perform three - dimensional mhd simulations in the cylindrical approximation , i.e. , neglecting the disk vertical stratification and switching off gravity in that direction . the equations solved are    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the density , @xmath9 the velocity , @xmath10 is the magnetic potential , @xmath11 is the magnetic field , @xmath12 is the current density , and @xmath13 is the pressure .",

    "the resistivity passes from @xmath19 to zero over a width @xmath20 centered at an arbitrarily chosen distance @xmath21 .",
    "we solve the equations with the pencil code   which integrates the evolution equations with sixth order spatial derivatives , and a third order runge - kutta time integrator .",

    "( [ eq : continuity])-eq .  ( [ eq : induction ] ) , to provide extra dissipation near the grid scale , explained in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fiducial ] . in the density plot",
    "we see the vortex as an enhancement at the dead size of @xmath21 .",
    "it weakens with time but attains a steady state after @xmath55=60 .",
    "the vorticity plot shows that the density enhancement is traced by anticyclonic vorticity .",
    "conversely the density dips are spatially correlated with regions of cyclonic vorticity . though the resistivity impedes the growth of the mri in the dead zone , it experiences diffusion of some magnetic field from the active zone .",
    "it thus appears weakly magnetized instead of completely demagnetized .",
    "interestingly , in the same plots we see that vortices are excited in the magnetized regions . a weak vortex is seen in the middle of the active zone at very early times , @xmath56 .",
    "it eventually decays , after 20 orbits .",
    "other intermittent vortices are also seen to be excited , at @xmath17=0.7 , between 40 and 70 orbits , and again after 85 orbits .",
    "these vortices exist in the midst of mri turbulence , as in the models of . strictly speaking , state that vortices that are excited by the baroclinic instability and survive in hydrodynamical models",
    "are destroyed when a magnetic field is abruptly introduced in the simulation .",
    "they do not exclude excitation of mhd vortices by other ways .",
    "still , these magnetized vortices should host magneto - elliptic instabilities , and given their strength , should not exist ; unless vorticity injection by the rwi is faster than destruction by the magneto - elliptic instability in the relevant scales .",
    "the origin of the vortex at @xmath17=0.7 lies in the initial condition , because we used a field with a peak in magnetic pressure around that radius .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rwi - conditions ] as the peak in magnetic pressure translates into an azimuthal velocity inversion and a peak of potential vorticity .",
    "this incurs a non - equilibrium configuration , that induces sub - keplerian motion inwards of the peak , and super - keplerian motion outwards .",
    "it triggers a localized zonal flow , that in turns excites the non - axisymmetric modes of the rwi .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : stresses ] the measured maxwell and reynolds stresses .",
    "the reynolds stress is shown for both the active and dead zone .",
    "we see that the maxwell and reynolds stresses in the active zone reach the @xmath57 level , agreeing with previous studies .",
    "the novel result of our model is that the reynolds stress in the dead zone is also at the @xmath57 level , only slightly lower than in the active zone .    without viscous dissipation ,",
    "the angular momentum is transported to the outer boundary , where it is damped , while the matter accretes . as a result of outward angular momentum transport",
    ", the vortex should migrate inwards however , this is not observed in the simulations .",
    "the vortex keeps radiating waves , yet it sits in the pressure maximum that generated it , which acts as a migration barrier .",
    "the same is seen in the models of @xcite .",
    "according to the results of , the magneto - elliptic instability should not allow the formation of the vortices seen in the mri - active region .",
    "this suggests that the models presented are under - resolving the mei - modes . to examine this possibility , we run models with twice ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) and four times ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) the midplane resolution of the fiducial model . the flow pattern after 12 orbits",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolution ] .",
    "we see that the inner vortex in the magnetized region has shrunk in size while the outer one in the dead zone has not .",
    "this is evidence that the mei is being excited , and the vortex core shrinks to a size where it is under - resolved .",
    "the size of the scale height in all models is @xmath64 , so @xmath4=0.08 for the location of the inner vortex .",
    "the low resolution model resolves that scale with @xmath65=9 points , the middle resolution one with 19 points and the highest resolution model with 38 points .",
    "we see that even in the highest resolution model , the density enhancement persists .",
    "we conclude that this vortex is either magnetically stable ( which is problematic in view of the claims of ) or the resolution requirement to capture the unstable modes has not been met .",
    "as we could not push the resolution even further ( the highest resolution model already consumed 2 million computer hours ) , the question of the stability of the inner vortex will be addressed in a future work , in local box models , to satisfy the resolution requirement .",
    "as shown by @xcite the main features of the mri can be captured with a domain spanning @xmath26 in azimuth as well as they can in a domain spanning @xmath27 .",
    "that statement , however , though applying for the axisymmetric mri , does not automatically apply to the non - axisymmetric rwi , for which the most unstable wavelengths are @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "viscous mergings then transfer the power towards lower wavenumbers , in a cascade leading to @xmath68 , i.e. , a single vortex mode can cascade further , back to @xmath69 , thus turning the rwi into a cycle ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this development occurs only over long evolution times and will not be dealt with in this work . ] .",
    "we check if there are significant differences pertaining to azimuthal domain size by performing a simulation spanning 2@xmath26 radians and comparing the result with the fiducial model .",
    "the model has the same numerical resolution , using twice the grid points in @xmath70 , [ @xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30=[192,768,64 ] .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pi ] .",
    "it is seen that at 12 orbits the @xmath27 model shows a conspicuous @xmath1=2 mode , whereas the @xmath26 model contains a single vortex at the same time .",
    "the two vortices in the @xmath27 model later merge into a @xmath68 mode , and as a result the flows in both cases are very similar at @xmath71=26 orbits .",
    "we also measure the angular momentum transport in the @xmath27 model , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stresses-2pi ] .",
    "the stresses are very similar to the ones shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : stresses ] , for the @xmath26 model .",
    "this means a box size of @xmath25=@xmath26 already provides enough azimuthal spacing so that the vortex does not interact with itself in a way that significantly affects the stresses ( the same is not true for local boxes ) .",
    "we conclude that studies concerning the linear growth of the instability require full @xmath27 simulations , yet @xmath26 suffices if the interest is in the saturated , @xmath68 , state .",
    "we performed the first simulation of a rwi - unstable boundary between dead and active zones in a protoplanetary disk with 3d resistive - magnetohydrodynamical models .",
    "we use a sharp resistive transition , that should be characteristic of the inner dead zone boundary .",
    "we find that rossby vortices are excited on the dead side of the transition .",
    "they first appear in an @xmath66 mode , as expected from the rwi , then quickly merge viscously into a @xmath72 mode , and finally reach @xmath68 , becoming a single giant vortex immediately outside of the transition .",
    "this lends credence to previous works that relied on alpha disk models with angular velocity transitions to trigger the rwi .",
    "we also assess the mass accretion rate in the dead zone , which is a result both of waves propagating from the active zone and of waves radiated by the vortex .",
    "we find normalized reynolds stresses of similar magnitude in both the active and in the dead zones , at the @xmath73 level .",
    "vortex - free transitions develop dead zone stresses two orders of magnitude quieter than the active zones , so this high accretion rate is a manifestation of the ability of the vortex to maintain high accretion rates . the same level is found for angular momentum transport in baroclinically unstable local disk models . because the vortex is born in a high pressure ridge , it does not migrate further in ; the ridge acts as a migration barrier .",
    "a puzzling aspect of our model is the development of a weak vortex in the middle of the active zone .",
    "the vortex was driven by the rwi at the peak in magnetic pressure due to the artificial initial condition . yet according to a recent study by , rotating magnetized vortices should be host to a set of unstable centrifugal hydromagnetic modes ( magneto - elliptic instability ) that should ultimately break closed elliptic streamlines . if that is the case , then our models are either under - resolving these modes , or vorticity injection by the rwi is faster than destruction by the magneto - elliptic instability .",
    "we pushed the resolution of the global model to the limit allowed by current computational power .",
    "the vortex shrank with increasing resolution , but we could not quench it completely . a conclusive test will require local models , which we plan to undertake in future work .",
    "a study of convergence with dead zone size , and an assessment of how wide the resistive jump can be while still allowing for rossby vortex excitation are also lacking .",
    "the models presented leave room for exciting developments .",
    "first , we used a static resistivity profile .",
    "though this is shown by to produce acceptable results , we plan to include dynamic resistivity in future models , following the reduced recombination network of , used by and @xcite .",
    "effects of hall mhd and ambipolar diffusion may also impact significantly on the nature of the active / dead radial transition .",
    "future work will also include stratification , shown through numerical @xcite and analytical work @xcite to matter significantly for the internal dynamics of 3d vortices .",
    "finally , interacting particles should be included to assess the ability of three - dimensional rossby vortices in dead zones to assist on planet formation .",

    "<S> it has been suggested that the transition between magnetorotationally active and dead zones in protoplanetary disks should be prone to the excitation of vortices via rossby wave instability ( rwi ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the only numerical evidence for this has come from alpha disk models , where the magnetic field evolution is not followed , and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by laplacian viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the transition in 3d resistive - magnetohydrodynamical models . </S>",
    "<S> we model the transition by a sharp jump in resistivity , as expected in the inner dead zone boundary , using the pencil code to simulate the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we find that vortices are readily excited in the dead side of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the mass accretion rate finding similar levels of reynolds stress at the dead and active zones , at the @xmath0 level . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex sits in a pressure maximum and does not migrate , surviving until the end of the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> a pressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the rwi . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetized vortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto - elliptic instabilities , yet it subsists in high resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that either the parasitic modes are still numerically damped , or that the rwi supplies vorticity faster than they can destroy it . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the resistive transition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks , if sharp enough , can indeed excite vortices via rwi . </S>",
    "<S> our results lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha - disk approximation , and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverage on modeling this transition . </S>"
