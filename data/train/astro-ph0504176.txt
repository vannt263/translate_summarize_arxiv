    "the spatial distribution of emission from various molecular tracers in star forming clouds depends not only on the physical conditions within the clouds but also on the ( time - dependent ) chemistry .",
    "this is very clearly the case for ccs and nh@xmath6 , where a pronounced spatial anticorrelation in the emission from these two species has been reported for quiescent , starless cores @xcite .",
    "a spatial anticorrelation has also been observed on large scale maps in several individual sources , such as @xcite , ( kuiper , langer , & velusamy 1996 ) , and @xcite .",
    "the lines of ccs are very appropriate for studying the structure and the physical conditions in dark clouds because they are not very opaque @xcite , and yet they are intense and abundant @xcite .",
    "its lack of hyperfine splitting and the fact that it is heavier than other high - density tracers ( thus showing intrinsically narrower lines ) make ccs a very well - suited molecule for carrying out dynamical studies .",
    "nh@xmath6 emission tends to trace the inner , denser regions of molecular cores , while ccs shows up slightly outside these central regions with a clumpy distribution @xcite .",
    "this relative distribution has been explained in terms of chemical and dynamical evolution of the protostellar core : ccs lines are intense in cold quiescent cores , but when the cloud evolves and star formation begins , high velocity outflows and radiation from protostars destroy carbon chain molecules . at the same time , these conditions favor the desorption of nh@xmath0 from dust grains . for this reason ,",
    "the abundance ratio [ ccs]/[nh@xmath6 ] has been considered as an indicator of evolution in protostellar cores @xcite .",
    "ccs is rarely found to be associated with evolved star - forming regions . on the other hand ,",
    "emission from both ccs and nh@xmath6 has been detected from the class 0 protostar ( @xcite ; velusamy , kuiper , & langer 1995 ) suggesting that a combination of both molecules can be used as a means of identifying the youngest protostars , and of studying their environments over a range of physical and chemical regimes .",
    "class 0 protostars have been proposed to be in the earliest stages of low - mass stellar evolution ( andr ' e , ward - thompson , & barsony 1993 ) .",
    "processes related to mass - loss phenomena occur prominently during this phase : collimated jets , powerful molecular outflows , and protoplanetary disks of hundreds of au are commonly detected in this kind of source @xcite .",
    "ccs and nh@xmath6 may therefore trace the interaction of these phenomena with the surrounding environment , providing information about the kinematics , temperature , and density in the close vicinity of very young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "water maser emission has also been shown to be a good tracer of mass - loss activity in ysos @xcite .",
    "previous studies suggest that water maser emission provides a good characterization of the age of low - mass ysos , with class 0 sources being the most probable candidates to harbor water masers @xcite .",
    "water masers have been detected in both circumstellar disks and outflows .",
    "this dichotomy has also been suggested to be a time - dependent effect , with masers tracing disks in younger objects and tracing outflows in somewhat more evolved sources @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared source b1-irs ( iras 03301 + 3057 ) is one of the few sources known to exhibit both ccs and water maser emission in the studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is a class 0 source @xcite located in the perseus ob2 complex at a distance of 350 pc ( bachiller , menten , & del rio ' alvarez 1990 ) .",
    "the cloud contains a large amount of molecular gas , as shown by the strong c@xmath8o(10 ) emission detected by @xcite .",
    "there is no optically visible counterpart of b1-irs , but 850 micron dust continuum emission has been detected by @xcite using scuba .",
    "there are two compact sio clumps in the vicinity of b1-irs @xcite , and blueshifted co(10 ) emission observed by @xcite , who suggested the presence of a pole - on molecular outflow .",
    "the sio clumps are located at the interface between the co outflow and the dense gas traced by the c@xmath8o , suggesting that the outflow , probably driven by the iras source , is interacting with the surrounding medium , thus yielding the sio emission through shocks .    in this work",
    ", we have used the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory to study the properties of the ccs , nh@xmath6 , and water maser emission from b1-irs , in order to obtain information about its circumstellar dynamics and stage of evolution .",
    "the rest frequencies of the ccs and h@xmath1o transitions are sufficiently close together that they can be observed simultaneously with the vla , also offering the possibility of using the water masers to track tropospheric phase fluctuations , if the masers are strong enough . unfortunately this was not the case at the time of the observations presented here , but the atmosphere was in any case very stable .",

    "@xcite detected moderately - high velocity blueshifted co emission centered close to the position of the iras source and consisting of many clumps at different blueshifted velocities .",
    "no redshifted emission was obvious in their data . given the distribution of the blueshifted gas around the iras position ( fig .",
    "[ ccs_co ] ) , @xcite suggested the existence of a molecular outflow driven by the iras source , and oriented pole - on with respect to the observer . in order to explain the absence of",
    "the redshifted co lobe , these authors suggested that higher density material is slowing down that component of the outflow .",
    "our results , however , do not support the pole - on geometry for the outflow .",
    "the 2mass source , which is within the error box of the iras position , is located at the tip of the blueshifted outflow , rather than at its center ( see fig .  [ ccs_co ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the 2mass source is actually tracing the powering source of the outflow ( confirmed by its association with the water masers ) , its blueshifted lobe would flow towards the southwest from the central source .",
    "the low velocity of the co blueshifted emission with respect to the @xmath45 of the cloud ( @xmath67 8 km s@xmath23 ) , and the lack of a significant amount of redshifted gas , are more compatible with the molecular outflow being close to the plane of the sky .",
    "the absence of a coherent velocity gradient of the water masers along their linear structure is also consistent with this geometry .",
    "the water masers are distributed in the direction of the extended infrared nebula , approximately ne - sw .",
    "this is the same orientation as the blueshifted co lobe with respect to the central source , and suggests that the masers are tracing the base of the outflow .",
    "note , however , that most of the maser components are redshifted with respect to the cloud velocity , and yet their location primarily to the south and west of the infrared source means that they coincide with the blueshifted co lobe .",
    "this apparent kinematic discrepancy could be explained if the masers are tracing the background walls of a cavity evacuated in the cloud by a molecular outflow close to the plane of the sky .",
    "the existence of such a cavity was suggested by @xcite form their c@xmath8o map . in the proposed geometry of an outflow close to the plane of the sky",
    ", the background walls could show redshifted motions , assuming a finite opening angle .",
    "the fact that no corresponding blueshifted masers are shown tracing the foreground walls could be due to different physical conditions of the gas , with denser gas in the background ( that probably corresponds to the region that goes deeper into the molecular cloud ) , and would produce a stronger interaction with the outflow in that area .",
    "proper motion measurements of the b1-irs water masers will help to clarify wether our proposed geometry , with the outflow close to the plane of the sky and evacuating a cavity in the cloud , is correct .",
    "the ccs clumps show a clear velocity gradient , with less redshifted velocities towards the central source ( see fig .",
    "[ ccsvelocity ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the ambient cloud velocity is 6.3 km s@xmath23 @xcite , these clumps would be redshifted with respect to the cloud velocity .",
    "this velocity pattern can not be explained purely by foreground clumps with infalling motions , for which we would expect more redshifted velocities closer to the source .",
    "nevertheless , if we consider that the ccs clumps may be interacting with the outflowing material , the infalling clumps could be slowed down closer to the central source due to this interaction , explaining in this way the less redshifted velocities at these positions .",
    "an alternative scenario to explain the ccs kinematics is outflowing clumps driven by a wind .",
    "if this wind exhibits a hubble - flow type velocity , that increases with distance from the driving source ( as it is observed in other outflows from class 0 protostars , @xcite ) , we could explain the velocity pattern by background clumps interacting with , and being accelerated by the outflowing material . in order to have redshifted ccs emission at both to the ne and sw from the central source",
    ", the outflow must lie near the plane of the sky , and the ccs clumps should be associated with the back side of the outflow , both for the southwestern blueshifted co lobe , and the ( as yet ) undetected northeastern redshifted co lobe .    a way to distinguish between these two models ( foreground infalling clumps decelerated by the outflow vs. background outflowing accelerated clumps ) , is to ascertain whether the motions observed in the ccs clumps can be gravitationally bound .",
    "there are two main components in the observed motions : the internal velocity gradients within the clumps , and the bulk velocity of the whole clump with respect to the central source .",
    "for the first component , the mass m needed to gravitationally bind a cloud of size @xmath68 with velocity gradient @xmath69 is @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "this means that the masses needed to bind the internal gradient within each clump are 1.3 , 0.3 , and 0.4 @xmath72 for clumps sw , nw , and ne , respectively .",
    "the masses derived for the clumps ( table  [ tbl - physical ] ) are of the same order of those necessary for the clumps to be bound , although we must consider this result carefully due to the very large uncertainties involved in these calculations .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider an average velocity of each ccs clump with respect to that of the ambient cloud , and the distance from the infrared source to the center of each clump , the masses needed to bind the motions respectively for sw , nw , and ne ccs clumps as a whole are 6 , 0.4 , and 6 @xmath72 respectively",
    ". the mass of gas contained in a region of radius equal to the distance to the central source would be 13 - 30 @xmath72 for the sw clump , 5 - 11 @xmath72 for the nw clump , and 51 - 120 @xmath72 for the ne clump , depending on the values of @xmath73 obtained from either averaged values for nh@xmath6 or ccs .",
    "therefore , we see that the observed motions in the ccs clumps can be gravitationally bound , a fact that does not allow us to discard either of the alternative models .",
    "regardless of the real geometry and dynamics of the region , it seems that there is an important interaction of the ambient gas with the molecular outflow .",
    "we must point out that the observed ccs clumps may not really be physical entities .",
    "these clumps are likely to represent regions of enhanced abundance of ccs @xcite .",
    "this chemical gradient of ccs is a result of variations in the local conditions of the cloud @xcite .",
    "however , our mass estimates to check if the motions are gravitationally bound are still valid even if the enhanced ccs emission are not physical clumps , given that we are calculating the mass of the region of gas enclosed by the ccs emission .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty is the value of the molecular abundance , which is a common problem when deriving column densities using other molecular tracers . in our calculations",
    "we consider a fractional abundance of ccs with respect to the h@xmath15 of 0.9@xmath2710@xmath74 , that is the mean value reported by @xcite for this region .",
    "single - dish observations show that the ccs is more abundant in starless , cold , quiescent dark cores ( such as , , or ; @xcite ) while ammonia emission tends to be intense in star - forming regions .",
    "these results suggested that ccs is a tracer of early time chemistry ( t @xmath4 10@xmath75 yr ) , while ammonia is a tracer of more evolved gas @xcite .    the abundance ratio @xmath76 has therefore been proposed by @xcite as an indicator of the evolutionary stage of molecular clouds .",
    "our single dish data provides column densities of @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath76 is @xmath335 , which is significantly lower than the value @xmath79 found by @xcite in most of the star forming regions in their survey .",
    "this relative lack of ammonia , or enhanced ccs , may be an indication of the early evolutionary stage of b1-irs . however",
    "this result could depend on the particular chemistry of each region , and we must be careful in this interpretation .    in previous single - dish works ,",
    "a spatial anticorrelation between ccs and ammonia was found , both by comparing detections of those molecules in surveys of sources @xcite , and by mapping their emission in the same region @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to check whether this anticorrelation still stands when we map a source at high resolution .",
    "the overlay of our ccs and ammonia maps ( fig .",
    "[ ccs - nh3 ] ) shows a clear anticorrelation between them throughout the b1-irs region , except @xmath80 to the north of the ammonia maximum ( which coincides with the ne ccs clump ) , where there is some superposition .",
    "this is the first time that this anticorrelation is observed at such a high - resolution ( @xmath81 = 1750 au ) in a star - forming region , and illustrates that the chemistry is not only time - dependent , but also exhibits small - scale spatial structure that can potentially seriously affect the interpretation of derived physical and dynamical properties if it is not properly taken into account .",
    "the chemical gradients traced by these molecules may be the result of changing the local conditions . at this moment , most of the theoretical chemical models considering the age and distance to the cloud center , include a large number of physical parameters to study the variation of the column density , the distribution , and the fractional abundance of molecules like ccs and nh@xmath6 among other species . some of these models include the strength of magnetic fields , initial chemical composition of the cloud , the probability of molecules sticking to dust grains , cosmic - ray ionization rate , and cloud mass @xcite , uv photodisociation , cosmic - ray induced photoionization and photodisociation reactions , co depletion onto grains , and desorption by cosmic - rays @xcite , or core geometry and view angles @xcite .",
    "until now , these chemical studies focused on starless cores and did not consider the effects of a central star , probably because most of the ccs studies have been made toward starless cores @xcite .    the way in which all of these factors and the activity of protostars ( in the case of star forming regions ) can modify the classical ion - molecule or radical / neutral pathways of production of molecules like ccs @xcite needs to be studied in theoretical works to give a better interpretation of our results .",
    "the development of models that implement the onset of energetic activity associated with the formation of a star and how this affects the ccs and nh@xmath6 production will be the key to ascertain the evolutionary stage of b1-irs .",
    "models treating consistently both ccs and nh@xmath6 and considering the effect of young stars could provide more reliable values of the relative abundances and column densities of both molecules as a function of the distance from the source . on the other hand , our data on b1-irs could be used as a reference work to test the predictions of those calculations in detail .",
    "future comparison with other regions observed with high angular resolution will be vital for understanding the precise meaning of the ratio between ccs and nh@xmath6 abundances in star - forming regions , in terms of chemical evolution .",
    "moreover , detailed chemistry studies in molecular clouds are an important science driver for the development of new interferometers ( e.g. sma or alma , see @xcite ) .",
    "our anticorrelation result at small scale proves that chemistry studies is indeed a promising line of research for these new telescopes .    the clumpy distribution of ccs emission detected in b1-irs ,",
    "has already been observed by other authors in several molecular clouds such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the case of b1-irs ,",
    "this clumpy distribution was first detected by @xcite in the ccs j@xmath9= 3@xmath15 - 2@xmath10 transition at 33.8 ghz with the bima interferometer with an angular resolution of @xmath3 30@xmath37 .",
    "in particular , there seems to be a spatial coincidence between bima clumps f and b and our vla clumps sw and ne respectively .",
    "moreover our vla observations reveal a lack of ccs emission at the position of b1-irs .",
    "this absence of emission has been suggested to be due to a lower abundance of the molecule , rather than to a density decrease , since this molecule needs high density to be excited and the density is expected to be higher towards the center @xcite .",
    "the clumpy distribution could be due to an episodic infall ( as suggested by @xcite for b335 ) .",
    "another possibility that it is worth considering is that ccs might be locally enhanced in shocked regions .",
    "in fact , the observed ccs clumps show kinematical signs of interaction with the outflow , which suggests that the ccs emission could be originated from gas affected by the impact of shocks .",
    "the outflow could squeeze low density gas to the higher densities ( @xmath3 10@xmath75 @xmath82 ) needed to produce the ccs , and trigger the formation of the molecule .",
    "such low density gas exists around dense clouds like b1 , and the outflow associated to b1-irs could interact with fresh material around the dense core .",
    "although there is currently no chemical model that includes this kind of phenomena related to the star formation , to support the suggested enhancement , observations of other molecules have suggested that their abundance is enhanced in the environment of jets and outflows , by shock - induced chemistry , as in the case of cs @xcite , nh@xmath0 @xcite , or hco@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "theoretical chemistry models support those findings @xcite .",
    "in particular , for hco@xmath83 it has been proposed that in some cases its abundance may be increased by a fast outflow impinging on fragments of dense gas @xcite , and this type of interaction between outflow and dense gas is also suggested by our ccs data , although the chemical reactions involved will certainly be different .    if this abundance enhancement takes place in short timescales ( @xmath3 10@xmath75 yr ) , one could expect to find clumps of the order of 5@xmath37 at the distance of b1 ( 350 pc ) , considering a typical sound speed of @xmath3 0.1 km s@xmath23 .",
    "therefore , new interferometric observations of ccs in other star - forming regions would be necessary to study these processes .",
    "the association of the central source with water maser emission ( which typically lasts for @xmath3 10@xmath75 yr in star forming regions ; @xcite ) and the existence of ccs , a molecule characteristic of early time chemistry @xcite confirm the early stage of evolution of b1-irs .",
    "the presence of ccs can be used as a marker of extreme youth among class 0 protostars ( de gregorio - monsalvo 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "furthermore , this combination of spatial , kinematic , and dynamical information from the ccs and ammonia may be used as a powerful tool to study the processes taking place in the vicinity of very young class 0 protostars and not just in quiescent cores .",
    "clearly , further interferometric ccs observations of the environment of other young stellar objects as well as theoretical chemistry models will be useful to determine whether ccs emission tends to selectively trace regions of interaction of the outflow with its surrounding medium .",
    "these studies combined with high - resolution data of nh@xmath0 and other molecular tracers will also help to determine the spacial distribution and dinamical evolution of these species .",
    "we have presented high resolution observations of ammonia , ccs , and water masers toward the class 0 object b1-irs ( iras 03301 + 3057 ) .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * there is a 2mass infrared point source located @xmath84 ne from the nominal position of the iras source , and at the ne tip of a blueshifted co outflow lobe .",
    "fainter infrared emission extending towards the sw from the point source is also detected .",
    "* there is a group of water masers associated with the infrared point source . their elongated distribution ( in the ne - sw direction ) ,",
    "and their unbound motions suggest that these masers are tracing the base of the outflow . *",
    "the infrared and water maser data suggest that the infrared point source traces the position of the powering source of the mass - loss phenomena in the region , and that mass is ejected along the ne - sw direction . *",
    "we detect three clumps of ccs emission surrounding the infrared source , all redshifted with respect to the systemic cloud velocity .",
    "they show clear velocity gradients , with less redshifted gas towards the central source .",
    "we interpret these gradients in terms of clumps that are strongly interacting with a molecular outflow that lies almost in the plane of the sky . *",
    "ammonia emission is weak and extended .",
    "it shows a spatial anticorrelation with ccs .",
    "although this kind of anticorrelation is known to be present in other star - forming regions , this is the first time that it has been observed with such a high - angular resolution ( @xmath81 ) . *",
    "the abundance ratio between ammonia and ccs is significantly lower than that found in other star - forming regions . given the fast disappearance of ccs in star - forming regions , this low ratio might be an indication of b1-irs being an extremely young stellar object ( @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr ) . *",
    "we suggest the possibility that ccs abundance is enhanced via shock - induced chemistry . however , theoretical calculations will be needed to confirm this hypothesis .",

    "<S> in this work we present vla observations of the nh@xmath0 , ccs , and h@xmath1o maser emission at 1 cm from the star forming region ( ) with @xmath2 ( = 1750 au ) of angular resolution . </S>",
    "<S> ccs emission is distributed in three clumps around the central source . </S>",
    "<S> these clumps exhibit a velocity gradient from red- to blueshifted velocities toward b1-irs , probably due to an interaction with the outflow from an embedded protostar . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow and its powering source are traced by a reflection nebula and an associated infrared point source detected in a 2mass k - band image . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this infrared point source is associated with water maser emission distributed in an elongated structure ( @xmath3 450 au size ) along the major axis of the reflection nebula and tracing the base of the outflow of the region . </S>",
    "<S> ammonia emission is extended and spatially anticorrelated with ccs . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that this kind of anticorrelation is observed in a star forming region with such a high angular resolution , and illustrates the importance of time - dependent chemistry on small spatial scales . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively large abundance of ccs with respect to ammonia , compared with other star forming regions , suggests an extreme youth for the b1-irs object ( @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the possibility that ccs abundance is enhanced via shock - induced chemistry . </S>"
