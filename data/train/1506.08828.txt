    "the classic distinction between galaxies and star clusters was riven by the discovery of stellar systems with intermediate sizes and luminosities : the ultracompact dwarfs ( ucds ; @xcite ) . the nature and origins of these novel objects",
    "have been debated ever since , with potentially important implications for how star clusters and galaxies form and evolve  tracing novel modes of star formation , cluster merging , and/or episodes of satellite galaxy accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ucds were previously overlooked , not because they were extremely rare , nor especially difficult to observe , but because they did not fit in with preconceptions about known object types .",
    "they were , therefore , filtered out during the focused search process ( cf .",
    "similar oversights discussed in @xcite ) . to those using ground - based imaging to study extragalactic globular clusters ( gcs ) ,",
    "the ucds were deemed too bright , and assumed to be foreground stars . to those using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , whose fine spatial resolution is well suited for appreciating the extended nature of the ucds , they appeared too diffuse , and were seen as background galaxies .    despite this lesson in selection bias , years of research on ucds ensued without questioning whether or not the parameter space of their properties had been adequately mapped out .",
    "the impact of this shortcoming was exemplified by the emphasis on an apparent size ",
    "luminosity relation for ucds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which was later argued to be merely a consequence of observational limitations at low surface - brightnesses , with the population of large ucds actually extending to much lower luminosities @xcite .",
    "it was also assumed that ucds were restricted to high - density environments , as they were first identified around the central galaxies in the fornax and virgo clusters , and indeed had earlier been predicted to form in this context @xcite .",
    "however , ucds were subsequently found around ordinary field galaxies , implying that their formation does not require such particular circumstances ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter n+14 ) .    as a recent step toward a broader understanding of ucds and other compact stellar systems",
    ", @xcite analyzed a mosaic of _ hst_/advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images of the virgo giant elliptical galaxy m60 ( ngc  4649 ) , and scrutinized _ all _ the detected objects to consider whether they might be associated with m60 rather than being discardable as foreground or background contaminants .",
    "consequently , in this single galaxy , spectroscopic follow - up revealed two new varieties of ucds : very low - luminosity , diffuse objects that bridged the gap between ucds and extended star clusters @xcite , and the densest galaxy yet discovered , m60-ucd1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s+13 ) .",
    "m60-ucd1 has a luminosity of @xmath4 , a stellar mass of @xmath5 , a half - light radius of @xmath6pc , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath7properties that are intermediate between the classical ucds and the compact elliptical galaxies ( ces ) .",
    "this area of parameter space is being studied by the archive of intermediate mass stellar systems ( aimss ) project , which uses archival _ hst _",
    "images in the first systematic survey for ucds across the sky ( n+14 ) .",
    "aimss has so far yielded the independent discovery of m60-ucd1 along with somewhat larger objects that now fully bridge the gap between ucds and ces and establish a firm link between these seemingly disparate families of stellar systems .",
    "ce transition objects have taken on a new dimension of importance with the discovery of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in m60-ucd1 that accounts for a remarkable 15% of its host galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "these `` overweight '' smbhs may be a pervasive phenemonon among ucds , based on their elevated mass - to - light ratios @xcite .",
    "it is therefore timely to search for new objects in this class , some of which have been hiding in plain sight for decades , as they are bright enough to be visible on digitized sky survey images and are included as `` stars '' in the usno catalogs .",
    "for example , m60-ucd1 has an apparent magnitude of @xmath8 , is visible in early photographs @xcite , and could easily have been discovered through serendipitous spectroscopy , had it been a target in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , as was its fainter cousin m59co @xcite .",
    "one limitation of aimss is its confinement to the narrow _ hst _ camera footprints , covering out to @xmath12@xmath9 in galactocentric radius ( @xmath1  10  kpc in virgo ) .",
    "the natural venue for continuing the search to larger radii and across a wide swath of the sky is the sdss , which is the basis for our new ucd data - mining program , with initial results reported here .",
    "these include the identification of remarkable , compact stellar systems around two virgo galaxies : m59 ( ngc  4621 ) and m85 ( ngc  4382 ) , at distances of @xmath10 and @xmath11mpc , respectively @xcite .",
    "the discoveries of these objects are presented in section  [ sec : search ] , the implications discussed in section  [ sec : context ] , and a summary provided in section  [ sec : end ] .",
    "we have used fairly simple methods to carry out a very rapid search for novel objects in sdss , as we describe below , with a photometric approach in section  [ sec : phot ] and a spectroscopic approach in section  [ sec : spec ] .",
    "we began by using sdss to search for objects similar to m60-ucd1 and m59co around giant early - type galaxies ( etgs ) in virgo .",
    "the defining characteristics were apparent magnitude ( @xmath12 ) , color ( @xmath13 ) , and size .",
    "although such objects are not resolved in sdss imaging , we noticed that they had `` galaxy '' classifications , and petrosian radii of 2@xmath143@xmath14 ( compared to @xmath11.5@xmath14 for point sources ) , so their extended envelopes are detectable in ground - based imaging .",
    "we started by calibrating our detection techniques on m60 and m59 , given their known ucd - like objects .",
    "remarkably , the sdss color  magnitude diagram of sources around m59 immediately showed m59co plus another , similiar object ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "this second one , m59-ucd3 , appears relatively close to m59 ( 2.2@xmath9 or 9.3kpc projected distance ; figure  [ fig : images ] ) , but was 10@xmath14 beyond the nearest _",
    "its photometric properties , from sdss - dr10 @xcite , are listed in table  [ tab : info ] . assuming the m59 distance ( confirmed below ) , the absolute magnitude is @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath140% more luminous than m60-ucd1 .",
    "m59 was imaged as a bonus galaxy in the sages legacy unifying globulars and galaxies survey ( sluggs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sluggs ground - based imaging from subaru / suprime - cam included both long and very short ( 10s ) exposures , to prevent saturation of bright gcs / ucds .",
    "we used @xmath16 filters , with 0.6@xmath140.9@xmath14 seeing .",
    "we reduced these images using a modified version of the sdfred2 pipeline @xcite , and found that m59-ucd3 is clearly extended when compared to a nearby bright star ( figure  [ fig : images ] ) . to measure the size",
    ", we use ishape @xcite , which fits the two - dimensional image of the object with a model surface - brightness profile convolved with an empirical point - spread function ( psf ) .    using the nearby star for psf reference",
    ", we find a good fit with a king model , and a size of @xmath17 or 20pc ( with uncertainties dominated by systematics ) . for a reliability check",
    ", we also analyze m59co and m60-ucd1 from the same series of suprime - cam images , and find sizes @xmath18 lower than the _ hst_-based measurements ( @xcite ; s+13 ; n+14 ) . more robust size and profile information for",
    "m59-ucd3 will require _ hst _ follow - up , which could reveal a two - component profile as in m59co and m60-ucd1 .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of m59-ucd3 with the goodman high - throughput spectrograph @xcite on the 4.1 m southern astrophysical research ( soar ) telescope , on 2014 february 9 .",
    "we used a single 600  s exposure with a 400  l  mm@xmath19 grating and a 1.03@xmath14 slit , giving a wavelength coverage of @xmath131007000  and a resolution of 5.7 .",
    "the spectrum was optimally extracted and wavelength calibrated in the standard manner using iraf , with skylines used to check for flexure , and has a signal - to - noise ratio of s / n@xmath155@xmath19 ( see top panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the heliocentric recession - velocity of @xmath20was derived through cross - correlation with an early k - giant spectrum taken with the same setup .",
    "this velocity differs by @xmath21  from the center of m59 , further indicating an association between this large galaxy and m59-ucd3 .      after identifying m59-ucd3 , we continued searching for ucds around other nearby , luminous etgs .",
    "in addition to sdss imaging , we now incorporated information from the sdss spectroscopic database .",
    "while far less complete than the photometry , the spectra , where available , allow immediate categorization of many objects without the time - consuming need for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "such a `` virtual observatory '' approach was used to look for ces ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but to our knowledge there has been no systematic search for ucds via sdss spectroscopy ( the discovery of m59co was serendipitous ; @xcite ) .",
    "our spectroscopic search made use of sdss - dr10 , with its expansion of the original sdss spectral database as part of the sdss - iii surveys @xcite .",
    "the first galaxy we checked was m85 , a virgo cluster lenticular with disturbed isophotes ( we selected it because it was the most luminous candidate not among the well - studied virgo ellipticals such as m87 and m49 ) .",
    "we noticed an intriguing object adjacent to this galaxy ( at 0.6@xmath9 or 3.3kpc ) , which was classified as a `` star '' photometrically ( with a petrosian radius of 1.4@xmath14 ) , but with a spectrum classified as a `` galaxy '' , and a recession velocity of @xmath22kms@xmath19too high for a normal galactic star , and similar to the velocity of m85 ( @xmath23730kms@xmath19 ) .",
    "this object was also included in an _",
    "hst_/acs image ( figure  [ fig : images ] ) .",
    "here it appeared very bright and compact but with much less of a diffraction - spike than obvious stars of similar brightness .",
    "our initial ishape analysis , using a few psf - reference stars , yielded a barely resolved size of @xmath112pc , depending on the detailed fit - parameters .",
    "a literature search revealed that the object was previously reported as a photometric gc - candidate with @xmath0 of 1.81.9pc , after detailed mapping of psf variations ( @xcite).50% in @xmath0 , which should be revisited with future data .",
    "] this was the brightest gc candidate cataloged by the acs virgo cluster survey , just barely making it past their @xmath24 selection limit @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the next section , the properties of this object are unusual enough to motivate a new term , the  hypercompact cluster , \" and we have named it m85-hcc1 .",
    "its spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "after confirming the new objects , and measuring some basic properties , here we present additional analyses , and discuss them in the context of other stellar systems .",
    "first , we place the objects in a diagram of size and luminosity for nearby , spheroidal stellar systems , along with reference lines of constant surface brightness ( figure  [ fig : uber ] , upper left ) . for m59-ucd3 , the surface brightness ( averaged within ) is @xmath25pc@xmath26 .",
    "this is twice as high as the previous galactic record - holder , m60-ucd1 , making m59-ucd3 a prime target for smbh follow - up .",
    "m59-ucd3 is a younger system ( see below ) , reducing its stellar mass - to - light ratio , with a stellar surface mass density of @xmath27pc@xmath26 that is @xmath150% higher than that of m60-ucd1 . for volume densities , we use scalings from @xcite , and estimate @xmath28pc@xmath29 in luminosity , and @xmath30pc@xmath29 in mass .",
    "scaling to the few - thousand visible stars of the solar neighborhood @xcite , an observer in the core of m59-ucd3 would see around a million stars in the sky .    turning to m85-hcc1 , its compactness combined with its luminosity places it nearly in a class of its own among confirmed , free - floating old stellar systems , with a luminosity like the brightest classical ucds but with a size like the smallest gcs ( figure  [ fig : uber ] ) .",
    "although fading with age would place it close to the previously densest - known star cluster , ngc  4494-ucd1 @xcite , that object also shows signs of fading youth @xcite .",
    "the mean surface brightness and mass density of m85-hcc1 are @xmath31pc@xmath26 and @xmath32pc@xmath26 , which is @xmath33 denser than m59-ucd3 .",
    "the volume densities are @xmath34 higher : @xmath35pc@xmath29 and @xmath36pc@xmath29 .    for additional context",
    ", we compare to two classes of object with possible evolutionary connections to ucds and gcs : young massive clusters ( ymcs , generally formed during galactic starbursts ) , and galactic nuclei  also called nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) .",
    "stellar masses should be compared , rather than luminosities , since young objects will naturally fade with time ( a key issue for the ymcs and nscs , not so much for the gcs / ucds ) .    for our new objects stellar masses ,",
    "we use spectral model fitting ( below ) . for ymcs and nscs ,",
    "n+14 have provided a compilation .",
    "these objects have a wide range of densities , making them plausible as progenitors of both gcs and ucds . however , the maximum reported ymc density is @xmath37pc@xmath26lower than m85-hcc1 by half .",
    "nscs , on the other hand , reach higher densities , with the densest one ( in the low - luminosity etg ngc  4476 ) even surpassing m85-hcc1 .",
    "we thus conclude that m85-hcc1 is most likely a tidally stripped galaxy - center , and also argue the same for m59-ucd3 based on its properties that are closely analogous to m60-ucd1 .    more evidence for the galactic - center origins of both objects would come if overweight smbhs were detected , as in m60-ucd1 .",
    "we note that the original motivation for sdss - iii spectroscopy of m85-hcc1 was its x - ray source , which has fairly soft emission and a luminosity of @xmath38ergs@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however , this emission might simply reflect a low - mass x - ray binary , as the estimated stellar encounter rate is extremely high .",
    "we turn next to clues from stellar populations , using stellar population synthesis with full spectral fitting and variable abundance ratios , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we fit over the wavelength range 40506550 , using a high - order polynomial to normalize the continuum , and a markov chain monte carlo algorithm to explore parameter space and return uncertainties .",
    "the resulting ages , metallicities , and alpha - element enhancements ( traced by [ mg / fe ] ) are reported in table  [ tab : info ] .",
    "both objects have near - solar metallicities , and probably mildly elevated [ mg / fe ] , implying fairly rapid timescales of star formation .",
    "their inferred ages are relatively young : @xmath1611gyr for m59-ucd3 , and @xmath39gyr for m85-hcc1 . for comparison",
    ", we have re - modeled the available spectra from m60-ucd1 ( mmt / hectospec ) and m59co ( sdss ) , and placed them in plots of metallicity versus age and [ mg / fe ] ( figure  [ fig : uber ] , lower - panels ) .",
    "m59-ucd3 shows similar properties to m59co , suggesting they may be coeval ( perhaps arising from the same or associated merger event ) .    for additional context , we also plot other objects from the literature .",
    "m59co , m59-ucd3 , and m60-ucd1 follow a high - metallicity trend seen in other massive ucds ( as discussed in @xcite ) , and in the centers of large etgs  in contrast to dwarf - galaxy nuclei and to gcs .",
    "m85-hcc1 is an ambiguous case , and might have originated in either a dwarf or giant galaxy .",
    "a more detailed discussion of individual elements is postponed , while here we only note an intriguing finding that nitrogen and sodium are elevated in m59co and m60-ucd1 ( see also s+13 ) , but not in m59-ucd3 and m85-hcc1 .",
    "we also consider the current environments of these four unusual objects .",
    "m60 shows indications of substructure in its gc system @xcite , although m60-ucd1 may have formed in a different , earlier event .",
    "the host galaxy m85 is well known to show large - scale disturbances in its stellar light , signifying a merger within the past few gyr , which is also reflected in a @xmath11.52.0gyr age for both its central stars and the bulk of its central gcs @xcite .",
    "it is furthermore the `` poster - child '' for red , diffuse star clusters , with @xmath1160 of these curious objects within the central @xmath110kpc @xcite .",
    "these are generally thought to be residues either of gas - rich mergers or of faded open clusters from spiral disks .",
    "m59 is a less apparent merger case , as may be expected given the older ages of m59-ucd3 and m59co .",
    "however , it hosts a dramatic , coherent central gc substructure @xcite .",
    "we speculate based on all the available information that m59 and m85 experienced fairly recent mergers with intermediate - mass early - type and late - type galaxies , respectively .",
    "we have presented the discoveries of two unique compact stellar systems , m59-ucd3 and m85-hcc1 , based initially on publicly available photometric and spectroscopic data from sdss / sdss - iii and _ hst_. further confirmation and characterization have come from subaru imaging and soar spectroscopy .",
    "these two objects were found to be the densest galaxy and densest free - floating star system , respectively  raising questions about how many more such objects exist , and how well the boundaries for stellar systems in size  luminosity parameter space are known .",
    "the objects may also provide clues to the physics underlying the observed maximum central surface density for stellar systems of @xmath40pc@xmath26 @xcite .    through examination of density , age , metallicity , alpha - elements , and x - ray emission , along with evidence for recent mergers in the host galaxies ,",
    "we conclude that the two new objects , plus two from the literature , are most likely the stripped centers of galaxies .",
    "there is strong potential for confirming this scenario in m59-ucd3 by adaptive - optics search for an overmassive smbh .",
    "we also emphasize that the post - merger indestructibility of such dense objects may in general allow them to be used as tags for the assembly histories of their host galaxies .",
    "we thank the sjsu astr-117b class for their endurance through ucd fever , katy murphy for helpful discussions , cindy tsui for artistic assistance , and the referee for a quick and helpful report .",
    "we are immensely grateful for the efforts of sdss , sdss - iii , and the hubble legacy archive in making their data easily accessible to anyone in the world with an internet connection .",
