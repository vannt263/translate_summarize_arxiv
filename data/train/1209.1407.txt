    "a precise knowledge of semi - leptonic decays of b mesons brings several advantages to flavour physics .",
    "they can be studied in the context of the heavy flavour effective theory .",
    "leptonic and hadronic contributions factorize , and we have a better control of the effects of strong interactions , compared to non - leptonic decays . on the experimental side , they are not helicity suppressed as leptonic decays .",
    "semileptonic decays contribute considerably to the analysis of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the so - called unitarity clock , the circle around the origin in the @xmath0 plane@xcite , is proportional to the ratio @xmath1 , which is most cleanly determined from semi - leptonic decays .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 normalize the whole unitarity triangle .",
    "a clean determination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 from tree level processes , that are generally assumed not significantly affected by new physics at the current level of precision , is a valuable input for other new physics sensitive estimates .",
    "the inclusive and exclusive determinations of @xmath2 rely on different theoretical calculations , each with different ( independent ) uncertainties .",
    "the former employs a parton - level calculation of the decay rate as a function of the strong coupling constant and inverse powers of the b - quark mass @xmath4 .",
    "the latter hinges on a parameterization of the decay form factors using heavy quark symmetry and a non - perturbative calculation of its normalization .",
    "the inclusive and exclusive experimental measurements make use of different techniques and have , to a large extent , uncorrelated statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "this independence makes the comparison of @xmath2 from inclusive and exclusive decays a powerful test of our understanding of semileptonic decays .",
    "the values of @xmath3 extracted from exclusive and inclusive decays differ by about two standard deviation , and a lot of effort , from both experimental and theoretical side , has been devoted to solve this long - standing puzzle . in this short review",
    "we discuss semileptonic @xmath5 decays , focussing on features where recent progress has been reported semileptonic decays are a counterpart of the @xmath5 ones in the charm sector : for a very recent review see e.g.@xcite ] .",
    "to extract @xmath2 we analyze the tree level driven @xmath6 weak decays . the starting point are their differential ratios , needed for taking into account experimental cuts .",
    "they can be parameterized in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 according to the formulas ( |bdl | ) & = & ( m_b+m_d)^2 m_d^3 ( ^2 - 1)^3/2 |v_cb|^2 ( g())^2 + ( |bd^l | ) & = & ( m_b - m_d^)^2 m_d^^3 ( ^2 - 1)^1/2 |v_cb|^2 ( ) ( f())^2 neglecting the charged lepton and neutrino masses . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are a linear combination of the form factors which parameterize the matrix elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ( @xmath13 refers to the @xmath14 polarization ) .",

    "the values of @xmath19 are constrained by kinematics : @xmath22 , with largest value @xmath23 .",
    "the experiments allow to fit only the product of the form factors multiplied by the ckm parameter , that is @xmath24 or @xmath25 and @xmath26 , data are taken at @xmath27 .",
    "the results are then extrapolated to @xmath28 , the so - called nonrecoil point , where @xmath29 , with leptons back to back and the mesons at rest . at the nonrecoil point ,",
    "heavy quark symmetries play a useful role in constraining the form factors ; with the additional input of @xmath30 and @xmath31 coming from theory , a value for @xmath2 can be obtained .",
    "the main theoretical problem is the non perturbative evaluation of the operator matrix elements .",
    "lattice and qcd sum rules are the two more common routes toward such evaluation .",
    "lattice determinations for @xmath6 decays are generally more precise than in most leptonic and semileptonic decays .",
    "form factors can be described to high accuracy by a normalization and a slope .",
    "it is possible to connect @xmath2 with the semileptonic form factors via ratios ( or double ratios ) where most uncertainties cancel in the heavy - quark symmetry limit .",
    "such ratios tend to reduce most of the normalization uncertainty in the lattice currents , as well as highly correlated statistical errors in the numerator and denominator .",
    "the most recent unquenched lattice calculation for @xmath32 adopts a 2 + 1 dynamical gauge configurations generated by the milc collaboration , and an action with the fermilab interpretation . after correcting by a factor of 1.007 for qed ,",

    "an alternative lattice approach consists in calculating the form factor normalization directly at values @xmath33 , that may allow more precise determinations , avoiding the large extrapolation to @xmath34 and reducing model dependence .",
    "it is currently available only in the quenched approximation , that neglects @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 quark loops @xcite .",
    "this approach , by using 2009 babar data @xcite , gives the estimate |v_cb| = ( 41.6 1.8 1.4 0.7_ff ) 10 ^ -3 a slightly higher value than ( [ lattice2 ] ) .",
    "the errors are respectively statistical , systematic and due to the theoretical uncertainty in the form factor @xmath38 .",
    "measuring the differential rate for @xmath39 is easier than for @xmath40 since the rate is higher and there is no background from mis - reconstructed @xmath39 .",
    "the most recent hfag experimental fit @xcite gives |v_cb| |f(1)| = ( 35.90 0.45 ) 10 ^ -3 [ vcbexpf1 ] while one can obtain @xcite ( 1 ) = 0.9080.017 [ f11 ] by using lattice with the fermilab action for @xmath41 and @xmath42quarks , the asqtad staggered action for light valence quarks , and the milc ensembles for gluons and light quarks .",
    "it includes the enhancement factor 1.007 , due to the electroweak corrections to the four - fermion operator mediating the semileptonic decay .",
    "this is the latest lattice result and updates , one year later , the first ( 2 + 1)-flavor lattice calculation of @xmath43 @xcite , reducing the total uncertainty on @xmath44 from 2.6% to 1.7% .",

    "the deviations are estimated to be parametrically larger in the case of @xmath51 with respect to @xmath52 . in order to get a more precise prediction for the form factor @xmath53 ,",
    "it has been suggested @xcite to combine the heavy quark expansion with a  bps \" expansion .",
    "the latter is an expansion in the limit where the kinetic energy @xmath54 is equal to the chromomagnetic moment @xmath55 : in this limit ( 1 ) = 1.04 0.02 with such estimate one finds @xcite |v_cb| = ( 40.7 1.5 _ 0.8 _ ) 10 ^ -3 the larger experimental uncertainty with respect to eq .",

    "the open charm system can be classified as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the radial quantum number , @xmath65 corresponds to the eigenvalue of the relative angular momentum between the c - quark and the light degrees of freedom , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the spin of the light valence quark and @xmath37 the eigenvalue of the heavy quark spin . the experimentally observed charmed mesons are associated with the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 states of the meson wave function .",

    "the rates for the @xmath90 narrow states are in good agreement with the 2005 measurements by 0 @xcite ; the ones for the broad states are in agreement with delphi @xcite , but do not agree with the @xmath100 limit of belle @xcite . measurements also indicate that the relation expected in the heavy mass limit @xcite ( b d^ ( j_l = ) l | ) ( b d^ ( j_l = ) l | ) may be violated ; this is known as the `` 1/2 vs 3/2 puzzle '' .",

    "the analysis of exclusive charmless semileptonic decays is currently employed to determine the ckm parameter @xmath3 . here",
    "we focus on the channel @xmath111 , where recent progress has been reported from both experimental and theoretical sides .",
    "other interesting channels are @xmath112 @xcite and @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath111 decay is the simplest to interpret , as it is affected by a single form factor @xmath114 ( in the limit of zero leptonic mass ) = |v_ub|^2    and @xmath115 is the momentum of the pion in the @xmath5 meson rest frame .",
    "most studied routes to calculate the form factor are once again lattice and light - cone qcd sum rules .",
    "theoretical predictions for the form factor split into two : predictions for the form factor normalization @xmath116 and for the functional form of the @xmath117 dependence .    by using current lattice qcd methods ,",
    "the hadronic amplitudes for @xmath111 can be calculated quite accurately because there is only a single stable hadron in both the initial and final states .",

    "such high - statistics calculations have been performed in the kinematic region where the outgoing light hadron carries little energy ( @xmath118 ) . at low @xmath117 , with light hadrons carrying large momentum of order 2 gev , direct simulations require a very fine lattice which is not yet accessible in calculations with dynamical fermions . such fine lattice would also be required to simulate heavy quarks ; alternately , one can resort to effective heavy quark theory .",

    "the results are compatible with the value of @xmath3 determined from the @xmath122 @xcite , while a value of @xmath3 is not extracted from the @xmath123 decays because the theoretical partial decay rate is not sufficiently precise for these decays .    in the sum rule approach , the @xmath124 matrix element is obtained from the correlation function of quark currents , such that , at large spacelike external momenta , the operator - product expansion ( ope ) near the light - cone is applicable . within ope ,",
    "the correlation function is factorized in a series of hard - scattering amplitudes convoluted with the pion light - cone distribution amplitudes of growing twist .",

    "direct calculations , without extrapolations , hold in the kinematic region of large recoil , with an upper limit for @xmath117 varying between 6 and 16 gev@xmath125 .",
    "the qcd sum rules provide an approximation for the product @xmath126 , and therefore the decay constant @xmath127 represents a necessary input for the extraction of the form factor . in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in several other papers , @xmath127 is calculated for consistency within the qcd sum rule approach , that is replacing @xmath127 by its two - point qcd ( svz ) sum rule @xcite . in this way",
    "one expects that radiative corrections affect in the same way @xmath127 and @xmath126 , and cancel in the ratio @xmath128 , together with some theoretical uncertainty from input parameters in common , e.g. , the @xmath129 mass . using the form factor results in ref . @xcite and the latest babar data @xcite , the estimate value is @xmath130 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the three uncertainties are statistical , systematic and theoretical , respectively .",
    "last year , babar performed a simultaneous fit to the data over the full @xmath117 range and the fnal / milc lattice qcd results , publishing the following average value @xmath131 @xcite .",

    "this fairly large difference has been explained by the fact the determination of @xmath3 from the combined data - lattice fit is most sensitive to the points at high @xmath117 , where the changes due to the improved hybrid treatment have lead to differences larger than those expected on the basis of the variation in the total branching fraction value .",
    "let us consider the @xmath135 decays , where the final state @xmath136 is an hadronic state originated by the quark @xmath137 . in inclusive decays ,",
    "we sum over all possible final states @xmath136 , no matter if single - particle or multi - particle states .",
    "since inclusive decays do not depend on the details of final state , quark - hadron duality is generally assumed .",
    "we can factorize long distance dynamics of the meson using an ope approach .",
    "another advantage , due to the large mass of the @xmath129-quark , is the possibility of using the systematic framework provided by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",

    "it is basically the same cast of operators , albeit with different weights , that appears in semileptonic , radiative and nonleptonic rates as well as distributions .",
    "the short distance coefficients @xmath139 contain the masses of the final state quarks ( from phase space , etc . ) , that require definition in a chosen scheme .",
    "the hadronic expectation values of the operators @xmath140 encode the nonperturbative corrections . while we can identify these operators and their dimensions , which then determine the power of @xmath143 , in general we can not compute their hadronic expectation values from first principles , and we have to rely on a number of hqet parameters , which increases with powers of @xmath143 .",
    "the hadronic expectation value of the leading operator @xmath144 incorporates the parton model result which dominates asymptotically , i.e. for @xmath145 . a remarkable feature of eq.([hqe ] )",
    "is the absence of a contribution of order @xmath143 , due to the absence of an independent gauge invariant operator of dimension four .",
    "the fact that nonperturbative , bound state effects in inclusive decays are strongly suppressed ( at least two powers of the heavy quark mass ) explains a posteriori the success of parton model in describing such processes .",
    "the phase space region includes a region of singularity , also called endpoint region , corresponding to a kinematic region near the limits of both the lepton energy @xmath146 and @xmath117 phase space , where the rate is dominated by the production of low mass final hadronic states .",
    "the region of singularity is a cut , since the hadronic final mass can vary , in contrast with exclusive decays . near the cut , and especially near the endpoints of the cut",
    ", the use of the ope can not be rigorously justified because there will be propagators that have denominators close to zero .",
    "corrections can be large and need to be resummed at all orders .",
    "a resummation formalism analogous to the one used to factorize sudakov threshold effects for parton distribution functions in usual hard processes , such as deep inelastic scattering or drell - yan , can be applied to the case of inclusive heavy meson decays ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this expansion is valid only for sufficiently inclusive measurements and away from perturbative singularities , therefore the relevant quantities to be measured are global shape parameters ( the first few moments of various kinematic distributions ) and the total rate .",

    "some traditional schemes for masses are not as advantageous in the present context .",
    "the pole scheme is most convenient from the point of view of computation , but plagued by large misbehaved higher - order corrections . the minimal subtraction scheme ( ms )",
    "sets the scale of order of the @xmath129 quark mass , which is considered unnaturally high , due to the presence of typical scales significantly below , down to the order of 1 gev .",
    "alternative schemes are the so called low subtracted mass schemes , where non perturbative contribution to the heavy quark pole mass can be subtracted by making contact to some physical observable . in recent literature ,",
    "the latter schemes are commonly used , in particular the kinetic @xcite and 1s scheme @xcite .",
    "care must be taken in converting from one mass scheme to another due to the presence of truncated perturbative expression .    as mentioned in the previous section , a common feature to many processes in qcd",

    "this requires knowledge of the fraction of the total @xmath179 that lies within the utilized section of phase space , which complicates the theoretical issues considerably .",
    "the region where the background is forbidden overlaps with the end - point , or singularity , region , where the energy and mass of the hadron final state are of order @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively .",
    "this kinematic region has sufficient phase space for many different resonances to be produced in the final state , so an inclusive description of the decays is still appropriate .",
    "however , here , the differential rate is very sensitive to the details of the wave function of the @xmath129 quark in the @xmath57meson .",
    "the non  perturbative effects related to a small vibration of the heavy quark in the @xmath57meson ( the so - called fermi motion ) are enhanced .",
    "the parton level differential distribution at the end - point region has its own problems , as well , related to the presence of soft and collinear singularities .",
    "large logarithms appear , which spoil the perturbative expansion and need to be resummed at all orders .",
    "a way to remedy the previous difficulties is to introduce a non - perturbative form factor , the shape function ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . it can be interpreted , from a physical point of view , as the distribution of the effective mass of the heavy quark at disintegration time . at leading order in @xmath182",
    ", the shape function can be extracted from a reference process , such as the radiative @xmath183 , and used to predict other inclusive @xmath5-meson decays . at higher orders , the shape function is no more universal",
    ", its functional form is unknown and one has to resort to model functions to interpret the measured differential distributions .",
    "the discrepancy between the values of @xmath3 extracted from inclusive and exclusive decays is a long standing problem , and a lot of effort has already been devoted to find possible solutions .",
    "two main routes to progress in the extraction of @xmath3 can be identified .",
    "the first one is to enlarge the experimental range , so as to reduce , on the whole , the weight of the endpoint region .",
    "latest results by belle @xcite access @xmath184% of the @xmath179 phase space , claiming an overall uncertainty of 7% on @xmath3 .",
    "a similar portion of the phase space is covered also by the most recent babar analysis @xcite .",
    "the second route is to enlarge our theoretical prospective , by comparing results obtained in several available theoretical schemes .",
    "all of them are tailored to analyze data in the threshold region , but differ significantly in their treatment of perturbative corrections and the parameterization of non - perturbative effects .",
    "the latest experimental determinations of @xmath3 come from babar @xcite and hfag @xcite collaborations .",
    "they both extract @xmath3 from the partial branching fractions relying on at least four different qcd calculations of the partial decay rate : blnp by bosch , lange , neubert , and paz @xcite ; dge , the dressed gluon exponentiation , by andersen and gardi @xcite ; adfr by aglietti , di lodovico , ferrara , and ricciardi @xcite ; and ggou by gambino , giordano , ossola and uraltsev @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the above approaches generally leads to roughly consistent results when the same inputs are used and the theoretical errors are taken into account . in fig.[fig1 ] we plot the values for @xmath3 ( without the errors ) and each point correspond to a different experiment ( sensible to a different experimental cut ) used as an input in the hfag average @xcite .",
    "the listed experiments and cuts are respectively , from left to right : cleo , where the cut imposed on the leptonic energy has been @xmath185 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; belle , where the analysis has been performed with limits on both the invariant mass ( @xmath186 gev ) and the lepton pair squared momentum ( @xmath187 ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) or with @xmath188 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; babar , with a constraint @xmath189 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; belle , with a cut on the lepton energy at 1 gev ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; the remaining points refer to babar , where various cuts have been imposed , as can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "other proposed theoretical approaches @xcite have not been included in fig.[fig1 ] , since they do not provide the same extensive list of @xmath3 determination for each experiment as the previous approaches .",
    "the latest method advanced @xcite aims at providing a global fit to the available data in inclusive @xmath171 and @xmath190 decays .",
    "no estimate of @xmath3 within this approach is available at the moment .    notwithstanding the proliferation of theoretical methods and approaches ,",
    "the values of @xmath3 extracted from inclusive decays maintain about two @xmath191 above the values given by exclusive determinations .",
    "also indirect fits prefer a lower value of @xmath3 .",
    "very recent ckmfitter results give @xcite v_ub = ( 3.42^+0.2_- 0.1 ) 10 ^ -3 [ vubckmf ] for utfit @xcite v_ub = ( 3.62 0.14 ) 10 ^ -3 [ vubutf ]    in fig .",

    "( [ vubckmf ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ vubutf ] ) , and babar latest exclusive fit , eq .",
    "( [ exclus ] ) . the closest value to",
    "the exclusive determination comes from the adfr approach and reads v_ub = ( 4.03 0.13^+0.18_-0.12 ) 10 ^ -3 where the errors quoted correspond to experimental and theoretical uncertainties , respectively .",
    "@xmath193 decays are attracting a lot of attention , due to the avalanche of recent data and to the expectation of new ones . apart from standard form factors and branching ratio computations ,",
    "the inclusive @xmath193 decays can be usefully compared with the inclusive @xmath5-decays to check quark - hadron duality and evaluate heavy quark expansion parameters , while exclusive decays represent an interesting probe to analyze the ( expected sizable ) @xmath194 breaking .",
    "there are well known differences between the @xmath192 and the @xmath102 system .",
    "the mixing parameter @xmath195 is about 30 times larger than @xmath196 , and the mass and width difference are sizable .",
    "another important difference is that the cp violating mixing phase probes the angle @xmath197 in the unitarity triangle , which is about two order of magnitudes smaller than @xmath156 in the standard model , and hence negligibly small .",
    "any large variation due to new physics can produce observable effects , and that alone would be enough to motivate the study of cp violation in the @xmath192 system .",
    "for a very recent brief review on cp violation in the @xmath192 system see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .    in 2010",
    "a discrepancy with the standard model has been reported in the measurement of the ( like - sign ) dimuon charge asymmetry @xmath198 of semi - leptonic decays of @xmath129 hadrons .",
    "the anomalous @xmath198 , found by the experiment 0 with @xmath199 of data , deviated @xmath200 from the sm  @xcite .",

    "is the semileptonic charge asymmetry @xmath204 , defined as a_sl = = [ asimsemi ] testing the `` wrong '' final state , accessible only through mixing . the asymmetry @xmath205 measures cp violation in mixing and it is independent from time and from the final state ( to within a sign ) , as it can always be ascribed to a property of the decaying states . at lowest order in @xmath206",
    ", we have | |^2 = 1-a a ( ) = _ s where @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "notice that the symbol @xmath210 is overloaded , since in literature it is used also for the cp violating phases defined in a slight different way .",

    "an addition of a non - standard phase , e.  g. @xmath214 , it is often used to parameterize effects of new physics or non - leading hadronic contributions .    since it arises from the meson mixing , if there is not a separation of the asymmetry due to @xmath102 and @xmath192 , @xmath198 can be written as _",
    "sl^b= c_d a_sl^d + c_s a_sl^s where the coefficients depend on mean mixing probability and the production rates of @xmath102 and @xmath192 mesons . here",
    "@xmath215 is the semileptonic charge asymmetry in the @xmath102 system , which has been measured since 2001 at @xmath216 machines .",
    "the actual averaged value from cleo , babar , belle , opal and aleph collaborations is @xmath217  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath218 , semileptonic charge asymmetry in the @xmath192 system , extracted from the 0 measurement  @xcite reads a_sl^s= ( -1.81 1.06 ) % the semileptonic charge asymmetry @xmath219 has also been directly measured by the experiment 0 via the decay @xmath220 , using data corresponding to @xmath221 of integrated luminosity @xmath222  @xcite .",
    "a new and improved measurement of @xmath219 using the full tevatron data sample with an integrated luminosity of @xmath223 gives @xcite a_sl^s= ( -1.08 0.72 _ ( ) 0.17 _ ( ) ) % the value of the standard model prediction for @xmath224 @xcite is negligible compared with current experimental precision .",
    "the extracted value for @xmath218 is in agreement with the direct and the standard model determinations .",
    "first lhc - b results are already available , from measurements of @xmath225 and @xmath226 asymmetries , giving @xcite a_sl^s= ( -0.24 0.54 _ ( ) 0.33 _ ( ) ) % recent precise determinations of the cp asymmetry in several non - leptonic decays already severely constrain a possible interpretation of the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in terms of non - standard cp - violating contributions to @xmath193 mixing , while more precision in traditional and new channels is expected soon ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . greatly improved precision or , even better , independent measurements of semileptonic asymmetries are needed to establish evidence of cp violation due to new physics in semi - leptonic @xmath192 decays .",
