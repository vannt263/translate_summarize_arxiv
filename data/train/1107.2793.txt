    "the motion of classical spinning test particles in a given gravitational background is described by the well known mathisson - papapetrou ( mp ) model @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be the timelike unit tangent vector to the `` center of mass line '' @xmath1 of the spinning particle used to perform the multipole reduction , parametrized by the proper time @xmath2 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total 4-momentum of the particle and the antisymmetric tensor @xmath5 denotes the spin tensor ( intrinsic angular momentum ) associated with it ; both fields are defined only along this center of mass world line .",
    "this system of 10 equations evolves @xmath6 and @xmath7 along @xmath1 but contains 13 unknown quantities : @xmath8 ( 3 ) , @xmath6 ( 4 ) , @xmath7 ( 6 ) .",
    "consistency of the model is ensured by imposing the tulczyjew - dixon @xcite supplementary conditions [ tconds ] s^p_=0 .",
    "moreover , implicit in the model is the requirement that the spin structure of the particle should produce very small deviations from geodesic motion , in the sense that the length scale naturally associated with the spin should be very small when compared with the one associated with the curvature tensor of the spacetime itself .",
    "otherwise , large values of spin would require taking into account the particle backreaction on the spacetime metric , i.e. , the problem should be approached from a completely different point of view .",
    "let us consider a spinless test particle orbiting a star which emits radiation .",
    "the radiation pressure of the light emitted by the star , in addition to the direct effect of the outward radial force , exerts a drag force on the particle s motion .",
    "this usually causes the body to fall into the star unless it is so small that the radiation pressure pushes it away from the star , a phenomenon called the poynting - robertson effect since it was first investigated by poynting @xcite using newtonian gravity and then calculated in the framework of linearized general relativity by robertson @xcite .",
    "successively many authors studied the poynting - robertson effect in more concrete situations , starting from the case of slowly evolving elliptical orbits for meteors @xcite , to more recent works @xcite , where rotation of the emitting star is taken into account . more recently the poynting - robertson effect for a spinless test particle orbiting a black hole was studied in both the schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes @xcite without the restriction of slow motion , but ignoring the finite size of the radiating body .    here",
    "we generalize the above discussion to the more realistic case of a spinning test particle subject to the poynting - robertson effect by including the radiation forces in the mathisson - papapetrou model .",
    "today we have evidence of the existence of accreting matter around massive compact objects , e.g. , active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the dynamical behavior of particles in close orbits around massive objects , while interacting with their radiation field , can be relevant when studying the evolution of shell or disk - like configurations of dust around intense radiative relativistic sources , where the loss of angular momentum via the poynting - robertson effect could act as a dust accretion mechanism .",
    "the radiation mechanism around a real accreting compact object is generally very complicated .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the case of a coherent flux of photons traveling along geodesics in some preferred direction .",
    "possible scenarios include a hot neutron star , a black hole accreting radiation or a system with an accretion disk which radiates .",
    "when the approximation of point - like test particles is no longer valid , we expect that the real poynting - robertson effect offers a different behavior with respect to the standard poynting - robertson effect for small dust particles .",
    "the mathisson - papapetrou model allows us to take into account the actual size of the particle in the framework of general relativity by introducing a characteristic length of the particle itself through its spin .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there also exists a wide literature concerning pseudo - classical test spinning particles , whose equations of motion reduce under certain limit to the classical mp equations @xcite .",
    "in fact , spinning particles can be equivalently described by pseudo - classical mechanics models in which the spin degrees of freedom are characterized in terms of anticommuting grassmann variables , associated  in the semiclassical limit  with the components of the spin tensor of the particle .",
    "the lagrangian formulation can be used as well to study spinning particle motion in external fields . here",
    ", however , we consider only classical test bodies , leaving for future work further generalizations of this analysis to the case of pseudo - classical particles .",
    "consider a schwarzschild spacetime , whose line element written in standard coordinates is given by [ metric ] s^2 = -n^2t^2 + n^-2 r^2 + r^2 ( ^2 + ^2 ^2 ) , where @xmath9 denotes the lapse function , and introduce the usual orthonormal frame adapted to the static observers ( or zero angular momentum observers , zamos ) following the time lines [ frame ] e_t = n^-1_t , e_r = n_r , e_= _ ,",

    "note also that @xmath24 , i.e. , the conserved angular momentum associated with the rotational killing vector field @xmath25 is assumed to vanish .",
    "this is consistent with having a non - rotating light source in a non - rotating spacetime .",
    "since @xmath16 is completely determined , the coordinate dependence of the quantity @xmath26 then follows from the conservation equations @xmath27 , and will only depend on @xmath28 in the equatorial plane due to the axial symmetry .",

    "consider now a test particle moving in the equatorial plane @xmath11 accelerated by the radiation field , i.e. with 4-velocity [ polarnu ] u=(u , n ) [ n+ ( u , n ) ] , ( u , n)^re_r+^e _ = ( e_r+ e _ ) , where @xmath29 is the lorentz factor and the abbreviated notation @xmath30 has been used . similarly @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the magnitude of the spatial velocity @xmath33 and its polar angle measured clockwise from the positive @xmath34 direction in the @xmath28-@xmath34 tangent plane respectively , while @xmath35 is the associated unit vector .",

    "in fact , by taking the mean values over a period of the perturbed radius we can estimate the amount of variation of the radial distance = _ k .",

    "therefore , in this case the effect of the spin on the orbit dominates with respect to the friction due to the radiation field .",
    "we have studied the motion of a classical spinning body in the field of a central radiating object .",
    "the model adopted is the standard mathisson - papapetrou model suitably modified by accounting for the contribution of the poynting - robertson radiation force in the equations of motion .",
    "we have numerically integrated the whole set of mathisson - papapetrou equations in the case of equatorial motion and coherent flux composed of radially emitted photons .",
    "the spin vector turns out to have only a constant nonvanishing component orthogonal to the motion plane .",
    "we have shown some typical solution orbits in comparison with the spinless case .",

    "this feature has been proved to be maintained also in presence of spin .",
    "dust particles would congregate at this radius leading to rings of matter to form .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed the interplay between spin and radiation forces by analyzing the deviation from circular geodesic motion on the equatorial plane when also the contribution due to friction can be treated as a small perturbation .",
    "the features of the motion thus depend on two different parameters , the spin parameter and the friction parameter , which are taken as small in order to avoid backreaction .",
    "the presence of the spin causes a slight change in the radius of the circular orbit about which the solution oscillates and an increase / decrease of the angular velocity depending on whether the particle is co / counter rotating ( i.e. , moving clockwise or anticlockwise with respect to the positive @xmath34 direction , respectively ) .",
