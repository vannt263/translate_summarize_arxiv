    "in a number of commonly considered supersymmetric ( susy ) models , strongly - interacting sparticles will be abundantly pair - produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and the resulting events containing jets and missing energy will stand out above the standard model background . the next challenge will be to make sense of the events , which will typically involve cascade decays through several intermediate sparticles",
    ". it will be particularly desirable to obtain information on the susy masses and branching ratios .",
    "it has been demonstrated that cascades involving lepton emission often provide relatively clean signals , which can be used to reconstruct several sparticle masses in some favourable benchmark scenarios , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , these decay channels often suffer from branching ratios that are low compared to hadronic decay modes , reducing the available sample size and therefore restricting access to high - mass sparticles .",
    "moreover , the charged leptons are often associated with neutrinos , for example in chargino ( @xmath6 ) decays .",
    "the presence of the neutrinos would confuse the interpretation of the missing - energy signal provided by escaping neutralinos in scenarios with @xmath7-parity conservation , as we assume here , and make the reconstruction of chargino masses difficult .",
    "some progress on techniques for measuring chargino masses has been reported for scenarios with one leptonic and one hadronic decay chain  @xcite , but these require models with a favourable combination of the corresponding branching ratios .",
    "the ability to reconstruct purely hadronic cascade decays would facilitate the discovery and measurement of charginos in more general cases , as well as enable heavier sparticle masses to be reconstructed .    in this paper , we take a new approach to the reconstruction of fully - hadronic sparticle events , starting from the missing - energy signal provided by the neutralino in @xmath7-conserving models , which suppresses standard model ( sm ) backgrounds .",
    "we use jet analysis techniques based on the  algorithm to identify the hadronic decays of massive bosons such as the @xmath8 , @xmath9 or higgs boson ( @xmath10 ) . in general , the majority of sparticle cascade decays yield fully - hadronic final states containing such massive sm particles decaying to @xmath11 jet pairs  @xcite . a certain fraction of these bosons , dependent on the sparticle masses in the scenario considered ,",
    "are highly boosted and the jets from the decays are closely aligned , indeed overlapping , in pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath12 ) - azimuthal angle ( @xmath13 ) space .",
    "such a situation presents both a challenge and an opportunity .",
    "the challenge is that the choice of jet finder becomes crucial : the treatment of jet overlaps can be sensitive to rather soft and subtle qcd effects , and yet somehow one needs to retain the information that the jet arises from the two - body decay of a massive particle .",
    "the opportunity is that , since the jets are close together , there is no combinatorial background ; no need , for example , to combine all pairs of jets to see if they reconstruct to the @xmath14 mass .",
    "we address the reconstruction issue using the sub - jet technique that was proposed previously as a way to identify high - energy @xmath15 events  @xcite .",
    "this technique and its extension to hadronic sparticle decays are described in section  [ sec : subjet ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : benchmarks ] some specific benchmark susy scenarios and the specific decay chains of interest are described : these involve typical decays of intermediate heavy charginos or neutralinos such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the simulations and analysis method are described in section  [ sec : analysis ] , and the subsequent section contains the results and conclusions .",
    "the identification of jets which originate from a decaying massive particle begins by using a jet algorithm to define the jet . in this analysis the  algorithm  @xcite",
    "is used , in the inclusive mode with the @xmath18 reconstruction scheme . for each particle @xmath19 and pair of particles @xmath20 ,",
    "the algorithm calculates the quantities @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transverse momentum of particle @xmath19 with respect to the beam axis and @xmath23 the parameter @xmath7 is a number of order one . if it is set below unity , it is less likely that a given particle will be merged with a jet , which in turn leads to narrower jets",
    ". thus @xmath7 plays a somewhat similar role to the adjustable cone radius in cone algorithms . in this analysis",
    ", initial studies indicated that @xmath24 provided a good compromise between efficiency and the mass resolution , and this value is used throughout .",
    "returning to the algorithm : all the @xmath25 values are then ordered .",
    "if @xmath26 or @xmath27 is the smallest , then particle @xmath19 or @xmath28 is labelled a jet and removed from the list . if @xmath29 is the smallest , particles @xmath19 and @xmath28 are merged by adding their four - momenta . the list is recalculated and the process is repeated until the list is empty . thus the algorithm clusters all particles into jets , and a cut on transverse momentum can then be used to select the hardest jets in the event .",
    "the algorithm is infrared safe , and has the additional benefit that each particle is uniquely assigned to a single jet . recently",
    "a fast implementation of the algorithm has been developed  @xcite which makes it practical for use even in the very high multiplicity events expected at the lhc .    in selecting a candidate for a hadronic decay of the @xmath0 or @xmath10 , first cuts on the @xmath30 and the pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath12 ) of the jet",
    "are applied so as to ensure that they are energetic enough to contain a boosted heavy - particle decay and are in a region of good detector acceptance .",
    "a cut is then applied on the mass of the jet ( calculated from the four - vectors of the constituents ) to ensure that it is in a window around the nominal mass of the desired particle .",
    "the next step is to force the jet to decompose into two sub - jets .",
    "the main extra piece of information gained from the sub - jet decomposition is the @xmath31 cut at which the sub - jets are defined : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the transverse momentum of the candidate jet containing the sub - jets @xmath19 and @xmath28 . in the case of a genuine @xmath0 or @xmath10 decay ,",
    "the expectation is that the scale at which the jet is resolved into sub - jets ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) will be @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the @xmath0 or @xmath10 mass . for qcd jets initiated by a single quark or gluon , the scale of the splitting is expected to be substantially below @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 , since in the region around the jet strongly - ordered dglap - like  @xcite qcd evolution dominates .",
    "this distinction provides new information in addition to the jet mass itself , as is illustrated in figures  [ fig : scale]a and  [ fig : scale]b , where the correlation between the jet mass and the splitting scale is shown for @xmath8 jets and qcd jets respectively .",
    "the events shown are @xmath8+jet events and susy events generated using pythia 6.408  @xcite , and @xmath8 + 3jet events generated using alpgen  @xcite for the matrix element , herwig  6.510  @xcite for parton showering and jimmy  @xcite for the underlying event .",
    "the parameters for the underlying event and the parton showers were those of the atlas tune of pythia and the cdf tune a of herwig and jimmy , taken from  @xcite  . ] .",
    "these models have been shown to give a good description of a wide variety of data .",
    "in particular , the modelling of the internal jet structure by leading - logarithmic parton showers is known to be good for jets produced in @xmath39 collisions  @xcite , @xmath40 collisions and photo - production  @xcite , and in @xmath41 annihilation events and @xmath42 collisions  @xcite .    although there are some differences between the results of the pythia and herwig / alpgen simulations , the conclusions are similar . fig .",
    "[ fig : scale]a confirms that the splitting scale in @xmath8 decays is relatively large , typically @xmath43  gev , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig : scale]b shows that the splitting scale for qcd jets with masses @xmath44  gev is typically @xmath45  gev .",
    "the distributions of of @xmath46 and of @xmath31 are shown in figures  [ fig : scale]c and  [ fig : scale]d for @xmath8 jets and qcd jets .",
    "the distributions are qualitatively similar , whether they are generated in susy events or in conventional @xmath8+jets events , and whether ( in the latter case ) they are generated using pythia or herwig . the scale of the splitting is seen to be peaked close to the @xmath8 mass for genuine @xmath8 decays , whichever the environment in which they are produced , and to be softer for qcd jets which just happen to reconstruct to the @xmath8 mass , again in both environments .    this distinction was noted and successfully used to identify @xmath8 decays in simulations of @xmath47 scattering at lhc energies in  @xcite . here , this information is used in the analysis described in section  [ sec : analysis ] to refine the selection of @xmath0 and @xmath10 candidates in sparticle decay cascades .",
    "although no detector simulation is employed in this analysis , the cut on the scale has been shown previously to be robust against the effects of the underlying events  @xcite , as well as effects due to the calorimeter granularity and resolution  @xcite .",
    "the pair - production of heavy sparticles in generic susy models yields on - shell electroweak gauge bosons or higgs bosons via the decays of heavy gauginos that appear as intermediate steps in cascades , e.g. , @xmath48 or @xmath49 , followed by @xmath50 or @xmath51 decays .",
    "exceptions are cases with gaugino masses that are nearly degenerate , in which there may be large branching ratios for decays via off - shell heavy bosons . since the largest branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath10 decays are those into hadronic @xmath52 final states , purely hadronic final states dominate in cascade decays via on - shell bosons , and these are also potentially important in off - shell decays .    for the decay chain @xmath53 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qw ] , one can demonstrate that the invariant mass distribution of the quark-@xmath14 system has a minimum and maximum given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath14 momentum in the chargino rest frame .",
    "if measurable , these endpoints give a model - independent relationship between the three susy masses , modulo the existence of the decay chain . if both endpoints can be determined experimentally , the squark mass can be eliminated , giving the chargino mass in terms of the lightest neutralino .",
    "supplementary model - dependent assumptions , such as the relationship @xmath56 that holds approximately in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , can then be used to determine individual masses of all three sparticles in specific theoretical frameworks .",
    "the decay chains @xmath57 and @xmath58 involving the second lightest neutralino , have endpoint formulae with the same structure , given by the substitutions @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively , in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : endqw ] ) and ( [ eq : pw ] ) .    in  @xcite benchmark models with such cascade decays were explored in a more generic setting than that allowed in the cmssm . relaxing the gut - scale universality of the higgs scalar masses or introducing a gravitino dark matter candidate admits values of the ( supposedly universal ) scalar squark and slepton mass @xmath61 outside the narrow range allowed by the cold dark matter density  @xcite within the restrictive cmssm framework .",
    "this , in turn , allows for a wide range of values for the branching ratios of the lightest chargino and the next - to - lightest neutralino into @xmath0 and @xmath10 . in our study",
    ", we use the benchmark points @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 from  @xcite to illustrate these possibilities .",
    "the points @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 are scenarios with relatively light susy masses , that should be easy to probe at the lhc , while @xmath65 represents a more challenging scenario with lower cross sections .",
    "common to all four points is the large branching ratio for squark to chargino / neutralino decays , @xmath66% and @xmath67% .",
    "the corresponding chargino and neutralino bosonic branching ratios are shown in table  [ tab : brs ] .",
    ".branching ratios for @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the selected susy benchmark models .",
    "the decays are calculated using sdecay  1.1a  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that the endpoint estimates have statistical errors which are in the @xmath70% region for benchmarks @xmath71 and slightly below @xmath72% for @xmath65 .",
    "the statistical errors are in general smaller without the cut on the sub - jet separation scale , particularly in the case of benchmark @xmath65 , due to somewhat larger statistics .    in the case of the @xmath62 benchmark point ,",
    "the fitted values are both fairly close to the nominal value , but with indications of larger systematic errors when not using the scale cut . both fits overestimate the endpoint , which could be expected as the reconstructed jets from squark decays have not been calibrated for the algorithm s tendency to overestimate the jet . for @xmath63 both fits are very close to the nominal value , while for @xmath64 the fits again overestimate the edge position . from the three benchmarks considered here",
    "this systematic error seems to increase for lower values of the endpoint , barring other more important hidden systematics . in the case of the @xmath65 benchmark",
    "both fits underestimate the endpoint , but here the statistical errors are large .",
    "considered as a whole , the results of table  [ tab : qwmax ] indicate that the systematical errors on the endpoints in our fitting procedure are comparable to the statistical errors .    for most of the distributions",
    "it is impossible to estimate the lower endpoint , since any structure at low invariant masses is washed away by the hard kinematical cuts on jet energies used to isolate the signal .",
    "the exception is the relatively high lying lower endpoint of the @xmath73 distribution for the @xmath64 benchmark , where a similar fitting technique to the one used for the upper endpoint yields a lower endpoint estimate of @xmath74  gev before and @xmath75  gev after the sub - jet cut is applied , compared to the nominal value of @xmath76  gev .",
    "the difference in endpoint estimate originates from a worse fit of the sideband distribution at high invariant masses when the sub - jet cut is used .",
    "we have in addition estimated both the lower and upper edge of the @xmath77 distribution for the @xmath62 benchmark point , where we reconstruct the @xmath78 from a lepton pair .",
    "after a similar sideband subtraction we estimate @xmath79  gev and @xmath80  gev , to be compared to the nominal values of @xmath81  gev and @xmath82  gev , respectively .    for the @xmath83 distributions ,",
    "fitting is difficult with the low statistics available both at the @xmath63 and @xmath65 benchmarks . from sideband subtracted distributions we make estimates by visual inspection , giving values of @xmath84  gev for @xmath63 and @xmath85  gev for @xmath65 , compared to the nominal values of @xmath86  gev and @xmath87  gev , respectively . as has been noted earlier",
    ", the feasibility of measuring these edges depends on the @xmath88-tagging achievable , and on the use of the sub - jet separation scale cut .",
    "the positions of the edges of the invariant mass distributions may be used to extract information on the spectrum of the susy particles involved . whilst the four equations giving the edges of the @xmath73 and @xmath89 distributions may in principle be solved to obtain the four masses involved , extracting accurate values of the absolute masses - as opposed to mass differences",
    "- will be difficult in practise because of the degeneracies between the masses of the bosons and of the gauginos , respectively , and thus in the upper edges , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imtruth ] .",
    "however , for the four benchmarks considered here this is an academic problem , as neither of the benchmarks have four measurable edges . given both the lower and upper edge of a single distribution",
    "the squark mass can be eliminated from eq .",
    "[ eq : endqw ] , and one can solve for the mass of the chargino or the next - to - lightest neutralino in terms of the mass of the lightest neutralino .",
    "this can in turn be used to arrive at the squark mass .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses_alpha ] the squark and @xmath68 masses determined using the upper and lower @xmath77 edge measured for the @xmath62 benchmark point , as functions of the undetermined @xmath90 mass .",
    "we also show the @xmath91 error bands on the masses resulting from the statistical uncertainty of the edge measurements , assuming that the errors on the two edges are independent .    with the squark mass known in terms of the @xmath90 mass , the upper edge of the @xmath73 distribution",
    "can also be used to give the @xmath69 mass . because of the quadratic nature of eq .",
    "[ eq : endqw ] two solutions result , none of which can be rejected out of hand   mass , but one can be rejected as unphysical since it is always less than the @xmath90 mass . ] .",
    "we show both solutions in fig .  [",
    "fig : masses_alpha ] . for values of the @xmath90 mass below @xmath92  gev",
    "there are no solutions .    for the @xmath64 benchmark point the same procedure",
    "can be followed for the two endpoints of the @xmath73 distribution , and we show the resulting squark and chargino masses as functions of the lightest neutralino mass in fig .  [",
    "fig : masses_gamma ] . for the remaining two benchmarks ,",
    "extracting masses is more difficult since only one edge is well measured .",
    "however , the lhc experiments have the potential for measuring other susy mass - dependent quantities , such as the effective mass  @xcite , whose determination would give complementary relations between the involved masses .",
    "given an accurate measurement of the @xmath90 mass , for example at a future linear collider , the heavier neutralino , chargino and squark masses could then be found with statistical errors in the range of @xmath93% , using lhc data , even if the particles themselves are too heavy to be produced at the linear collider .",
    "we have shown in this paper , we believe for the first time , that it is possible to extract a susy signal solely from the hadronic decays of @xmath8 bosons produced in cascade decays involving charginos , and that the measurement of this signal may provide useful information about the sparticle mass spectrum . in each of the benchmarks studied , the upper edge of the @xmath73 mass distribution in the decay chain @xmath94 can be measured , with a statistical error of @xmath70% for the relatively light sparticle masses of benchmarks @xmath71 and @xmath72% for the heavier @xmath65 , with squark and gluino masses above @xmath95  tev .",
    "systematic errors in the background and fitting are estimated to be of the same order as the statistical errors . in the case of benchmark @xmath64 , we are also able to extract the position of the lower edge of the @xmath73 mass distribution , and in the case of point @xmath62 we extract both the upper and the lower edges of the @xmath77 mass distribution , using the leptonic decays of @xmath78 bosons .",
    "there are also clear indications in benchmarks @xmath63 and @xmath65 for the possibility of observing the upper edge of the @xmath83 mass distribution using @xmath96 decays with collimated @xmath88-jets , but conclusions on such a signal require further analysis and better understanding of the @xmath88-tagging efficiency for these jets in a full detector simulation .",
    "the hadronic signals were extracted using the  algorithm for jet reconstruction , including the single - jet mass and the proposal of  @xcite to improve the identification of hadronic decays of heavy bosons via a cut on the sub - jet separation scale .",
    "the  algorithm is shown to be well suited for reconstructing edge features in the considered invariant mass distributions .",
    "the sub - jet cut procedure improves quantitatively the signal - to - background ratio , and while the loss of statistics increases the statistical errors , fits to the edges of the @xmath73 distribution show improved results with respect to the nominal values when using the sub - jet cut . for the @xmath83 distributions with their small signal - to - background ratio ,",
    "the sub - jet cut is crucial in reducing the background to a manageable level .    a detailed exploration of the capabilities of the lhc experiments to measure and use all the information that could be gained from these benchmark points , and hence a more detailed display of the value added to the global fits by the measurements described here , lies beyond the scope of this study .",
    "however , we do note that this technique provides novel information on chargino and neutralino spectroscopy , e.g. , the difference between the @xmath97 and @xmath69 mases , and in at least one case the @xmath98 mass difference .",
    "these pieces of information are useful for potentially constraining susy models and perhaps foreseeing the locations of interesting thresholds in @xmath99 annihilation .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , similar techniques for analysing hadronic final states arising from the decays of heavy particles should be useful in other situations .",
    "examples include the analysis of top physics , the search for @xmath7-violating hadronic decays of sparticles , or in the isolation of a generic susy signal from qcd sm backgrounds .",
    "indeed , some recent studies have highlighted the potential of single - jet mass cuts in exotic searches  @xcite , and we note that the @xmath31-scale cut should also be useful in these cases .",
    "we believe this to be an area meriting much further experimental and phenomenological study .",

    "<S> consequently , measurements of the supersymmetric mass spectrum at the per - cent level can be obtained from cascades including the hadronic decays of such massive intermediate bosons .    ` </S>",
