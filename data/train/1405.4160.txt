    "the emergence of compressive sampling has renewed the interest in spectral analysis .",

    "power spectrum reconstruction from compressive measurements becomes more appropriate  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "compressive power spectrum reconstruction for a wide - sense stationary ( wss ) signal is possible , even for a non - sparse power spectrum , by exploiting the toeplitz structure of its correlation matrix  @xcite . unlike  @xcite",
    ",  @xcite considers a multiband signal ( which is not necessarily wss ) , where the spectra at different bands are uncorrelated .",
    "this allows  @xcite to exploit the diagonal structure of the correlation matrix of the entries at different bands .    in wireless communications ,",
    "the received user signal might suffer from fading and the use of a single receiver to compressively reconstruct either the spectrum or the power spectrum of the user signal might be insufficient to reach the required performance . in order to exploit channel diversity ,",
    "@xcite proposes a cooperative compressive wideband spectrum sensing method for cr networks , which also reduces the required sampling rate per sensor .",

    ", the exploitation of the cross - spectra between the compressive measurements at different sensors reduces the required sampling rate per sensor without requiring the power spectrum to be sparse , but it builds upon the knowledge of the channel state information ( csi ) . as in  @xcite , our work focuses on cooperative compressive power spectrum estimation but we do not need csi as we do not exploit the cross - spectra between different sensors .",
    "we consider groups of sensors where different groups employ different sub - nyquist sampling patterns .",
    "each group estimates the temporal correlation only for certain lags and not for the entire correlation support .",
    "the fusion centre ( fc ) collects the correlation estimates at different lags produced by different groups of sensors .",
    "the combined correlation values at the fc , which should include all the lags in the considered correlation support , are then used to estimate the power spectrum . the required sampling rate per sensor",
