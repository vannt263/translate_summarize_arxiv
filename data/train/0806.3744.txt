    "in einstein s theory of gravitation space - time is relative in the sense that the metric depends on the distribution of matter . however , long before the einstein theory poincar showed that geometry of space depends also on the properties of measuring instruments .",
    "only an aggregate `` geometry + measuring instruments '' has a physical meaning , verifiable by experience .",
    "after minkowski this can be also said about geometry of space - time .",
    "some results of the attempt to actualize these ideas , and a generalization of the vacuum einstein s gravitation equations are considered in @xcite .",
    "such approach allows to consider gravitation both as a field in flat space - time and as a space - time curvature .",
    "the equations do not contradict the existing observations data .",
    "however , the physical consequences resulting from them are radically different from the ones of general relativity at distances of the order of the schwarzschild radius or less than that from a dot mass .",
    "it is very important that this fact provides a natural explanation of modern data of the universe expansion .",
    "however , this fact leads also to another important physical consequence , which still has no confirmation .",
    "observations give evidences for the existence of supermassive compact cold objects in galactic centers @xcite .",
    "standard conditions of the equilibrium of selfgravitating degenerate fermi - gas forbid the existence of very massive objects . for this reason they are usually identified with black holes",
    ". however lack of the evidence of the existence of an event horizon admits also other explanations of the nature of such objects .    in @xcite the possibility of the existence of supermassive equilibrium configurations of the degenerate fermi gas with radii less than the schwarzschild one has been considered .",
    "such objects have no event horizon and are an alternative to the hypothesis of the existence of black holes .",
    "it is later , in @xcite , some observable consequences of the existence of such object in the galaxy center have been considered .",
    "however , it is seems that a theoretical justification of the existence of such objects is insufficiently convincing for observers as it is based on conclusions resulting from the author s gravitation equations considered only in a brief note @xcite . in the present paper , being based on the recent paper @xcite a simple and a clear justification of possibility of the existence of such objects is given .",
    "unlike electrodynamics , einstein s equations are not invariant with respect to a wide class of transformations of field variables in use ( christoffel symbols or metric tensor ) leaving the equation of motion of test particles ( geodesic lines ) invariant @xcite .",
    "for example , all christoffel symbols @xmath0 obtained by the transformations @xmath1 where @xmath2 are an arbitrary differentiable vector - function , describe the same gravitational field because the geodesic equations@xmath3 remain invariant under transformation ( [ transformchristoffels ] ) in any given coordinate system .",
    "( the points denote differentiation with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath5 is speed of light ) .",
    "however , einstein s equations are not invariant under such transformations because the ricci tensor is transformed under ( [ transformchristoffels ] ) as follows @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a covariant derivative with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "each transformation ( [ transformchristoffels ] ) induces some mapping @xmath10 of the metric tensor @xmath11 which can be obtained by solving some partial differential equation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such mappings leave the equations of motion of test particles invariant , and , consequently , all metric tensors resulting from a given @xmath11 by a geodesic transformation describe the same gravitational field .",
    "thus , such transformations are gauge transformations of the tensor @xmath11 .",
    "for this reason , one can suppose that in any gravitational theory , based on einstein s hypothesis of the motion of test particles along geodesic lines , only geodesic - invariant objects can have a physical sense .",
    "the simplest geodesic - invariant tensor @xmath12 can be formed as follows @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14\\ ] ] and @xmath15\\ ] ] are the thomas symbols for the riemannian space - time @xmath16 and for the minkowski space - time @xmath17 in a used coordinate system , respectively .",
    "the thomas symbols are formed by the christoffel symbols @xmath18 and @xmath19 of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .    in paper",
    "@xcite a theory in which geodesic mappings play a role of gauge transformations is considered .",
    "the investigation of the problem leads to the conclusion that is of interest to explore physical consequences from the following bimetric geodesic - invariant generalization of einstein s vacuum equations to @xmath22 : @xmath23 the symbol @xmath24 denotes a covariant derivative in @xmath17 with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the derivation of basic equations , they physical interpretations , and a correct utilization are possible only owing to reconsider of a deep problem of space - time relativity with respect to measuring instruments , going back to poincar fundamental ideas . according to @xcite both the space - time , @xmath17 and @xmath16 , have physical meaning since only aggregate `` space - time geometry + frame of reference '' have a physical meaning .",
    "we can consider space - time both as the minkowski one in an inertial reference frames , and as the riemannian space - time with curvature other than zero  in the so - called proper reference frames of the field , the body of reference of which is formed by particles moving in this gravitational field . for purpose of this paper",
    "it is essentially only the important conclusion that an observer , which explores gravitational field of a distant massive compact object in an inertial reference frame , can consider global space - time as the minkowski one .    in order to see better the relationship between ( [ myvacuumeqs ] ) and the einstein vacuum equation",
    ", it should be noted that we can select a gauge condition for the christoffel symbols as follows : @xmath25 at such covariant gauge condition eq .",
    "( [ myvacuumeqs ] ) coincides with the vacuum einstein s equations .",
    "( at least locally ) . therefore , the observer which is located in an inertial reference frame far away from a compact object can describe gravity of the object field by the spherically - symmetric solution of the vacuum einstein equations in the minkowski space - time ( in which @xmath26 is simply a tensor field ) at the additional condition @xmath27 .",
    "such equations somewhat resemble the equations of classical electrodynamics for 4-potential together with some specific gauge conditions .",
    "it is that will be used in the next section .",
    "if a matter sphere is considered as formed by means of consecutive injections of thin spherically - symmetric layers of the matter from infinity @xcite , an equation for finding of the gravitational energy of the sphere can be found by using the vacuum solution of the gravitational equations @xcite for a dot source .",
    "the differential equations of the motion of a test particle in the spherically - symmetric gravitational field of a dot mass @xmath28 from the point of view of a distant observer can be found from the lagrangian @xmath29^{1/2 } \\label{lagrtestparticls},%\\ ] ] where @xmath30 are the spherical coordinates , @xmath31 is the particle mass , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the functions of the radial coordinate @xmath35",
    ".    the equations of the motion of a test particle in the field of a point mass @xmath28 , based on the solution of the einstein equations under the condition @xmath27 in minkowski space - time , are of the form @xcite",

    ", @xmath47 is the gravitational constant .",
    "if the radial distance @xmath35 from the dot massive object is many larger than the schwarzschild radius @xmath48 of the object , physical consequences following from ( [ myvacuumeqs ] ) are very close to the ones resulting from einstein s equations",
    ". however , they are very different when @xmath35 is of the order of @xmath48 , or less than that .    from point of view of a distant observer free - falling particles move up to the center .",
    "the spherically - symmetric solution has no event horizon @xcite , and this fact is not a consequence of some specific coordinate system .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqsmotiontestpart1 ] ) that at @xmath49 the energy of a rest particle at the distance @xmath35 from the center is : @xmath50 at the condition @xmath51 it yields @xmath52 if @xmath53we obtain at first order to @xmath54@xmath55 in this case the gravitational energy of the test particle tends to zero when @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , the difference between the gravitational energy of the thin matter layer of mass @xmath57 at the distance @xmath35 from the center and the one at infinity is @xmath58 .",
    "the gravitational energy of a material sphere , formed by means of consecutive additions of thin spherically - symmetric layers of the matter @xcite is equal to @xmath59 where @xmath60and @xmath61 is the mass - energy density .",
    "if the matter sphere is an isentropic ideal fluid in equilibrium state , ( [ egr_integral ] ) can be transformed to more useful form .",
    "the equilibrium condition of the ideal isentropic fluid is of the form @xcite @xmath62 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath35 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 is matter rest - density , where @xmath65 is the neutron mass and @xmath66 is the particles number density , @xmath67 is the enthalpy per unit volume .",
    "therefore , we can use the following equation of the sphere equilibrium:@xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 is the presure,@xmath71 where @xmath72 is the schwarzschild radius of the sphere .",
    "by using ( [ equilibriumequationsphere ] ) , eq .",

    "because usually @xmath80 by using a polytropic equation of the fluid state we obtain that the gravitational energy of the object with radius @xmath81 is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a volume element .",
    "the gravitational energy is very small as compared with full energy @xmath84 of the object    for the object with radius @xmath85 the situation is another .",
    "if @xmath86 the value of @xmath87 is close to zero , and the gravitational energy is close to @xmath88",
    "for the total energy of the uniform sphere we obtain the relationship @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91 is the internal energy of the fluid . thus , @xmath92 the magnitude @xmath87 contains the total mass of the object @xmath93 where @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 . if @xmath97 @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 for this reason in ( [ finalenergyequation ] ) we can replace approximately @xmath28 in @xmath87 by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a parameter which lays in the range @xmath103 .",
    "for an uniform sphere of a nonrelativistic degenerate electronic or neutron ideal gas @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the total number of particles , and @xmath106 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 can be considered as the function of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "figures 1 - 4 show the total energy of uniform spherical configurations of degenerate fermi - gas , considered as an ideal isentropic fluid , as a function of @xmath106 for the several values of @xmath105 .",

    "it follows from the figures that the total energy has the minimum not only at @xmath108 ( neutron star ) , but also at many larger values of @xmath105 .",

    "the first three configuration are polytropic neutron configurations , and the configuration at last line is the electronic one . according to the used simple model the maximal mass of the purely neutronic configurations is approximately @xmath110 of the sun mass .",
