    "<S> the dependence of the lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) of charged , thermosensitive copolymers on their charge fraction and the salt concentration is investigated by employing systematic cloud - point experiments and analytical theory . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is based on the concept of the donnan equilibrium incorporated into a thermodynamic expansion of a two - state free energy around a charge - neutral reference homopolymer and should be applicable for weakly charged ( or highly salted ) polymer systems . </S>",
    "<S> very good agreement is found between the theoretical description and the experiments for aqueous solutions of the responsive copolymer poly(nipam__-co-__evimbr ) for a wide range of salt concentrations and charge fractions up to 8% , using only two global , physical fitting parameters .    in the last years </S>",
    "<S> we have witnessed a massive increase in the development of stimuli - responsive copolymers with various architectures for the potential use in smart functional materials , such as drug carriers , antifouling coatings , soft biomimetical tissue , nanoreactors , and carbon nanotube dispersions .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the virtue of stimuli - responsive copolymers is that close to their lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) , a stimulus can easily switch the copolymer s hydration properties from being mainly hydrophilic to hydrophobic leading to substantial changes in its physicochemical properties . </S>",
    "<S> thus , near the lcst the material is easily tuneable to possess the functional behavior adequate for a desired application .    a very important tool to control the lcst of a polymer is the copolymerization to introduce electrostatically charged groups and the subsequent fine - tuning by salt concentration and the solution s ph value .  @xcite analytical formulas which describe and predict lcst changes with charge fraction and salt concentration could be highly useful for the guidance of these effects . </S>",
    "<S> in this contribution we present a starting point for such a theoretical framework for slightly charged polymers and compare to novel , well - controlled and systematic lcst estimates by cloud - point measurements of the responsive copolymer poly(n - isopropylacrylamide__-co-__1-ethyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide ) ; poly(nipam__-co-__evimbr).@xcite we find excellent agreement of our theoretical approach with the experiments for a large parameter space covering charge fractions up to 8% and the millimolar to molar range of salt concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> our description may serve as a guide for the optimization of stimuli - responsive copolymer architectures in the future design of soft functional materials .    </S>",
    "<S> in our theoretical model we assume that the copolymer volume transition at the lcst can be understood as a transition from a dense collapsed state of the copolymer to an expanded , coil - like state in a bimodal free energy landscape  @xcite as a function of polymer size , for instance , the copolymer specific volume @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> schematically , the free energy @xmath1 of such a two - state model is shown in fig .  1 , with the corresponding minima in the compact globular ( g ) and the extended coil ( c ) states at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .     </S>",

    "<S> the free energy of the compact globule state is elevated by a small amount @xmath5 by charging a small fraction @xmath6 of copolymer monomers ( dashed red curve ) , thus favoring the coil over the globule state . </S>",
    "<S> this perturbation can be compensated by a change @xmath7 of the temperature leading to a new lcst . in the illustrative conformations , </S>",

    "<S> we assume very narrow free energy minima such that in equilibrium @xmath1 is dominated by its values right at @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is accompanied by a transition entropy per monomer @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> if we identify @xmath12 with the gibbs free energy , then the usual thermodynamic relation @xmath13 provides @xmath14 at the lcst , where @xmath15 is the corresponding transition enthalpy per monomer .    charging the copolymer by a small fraction @xmath16 , defined by the charge valency @xmath17 times @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio between the numbers of chargeable copolymer monomers and total monomers @xmath19 , will lead to a perturbation of the bimodal free energy distribution . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we denote @xmath6 as _ charge fraction _ and @xmath18 as the _ copolymer fraction_. for weak charging the effects in the compact globule will be much larger than for the expanded state due to the close spatial proximity of the charged groups and the resulting electrostatic repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume in the following that charging elevates the compact state by an electrostatic energy @xmath5 , while the expanded state remains unperturbed , cf . </S>",
    "<S> the illustration in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> this small shift @xmath5 will be a function of charge fraction @xmath6 and the salt concentration @xmath20 and can be reversed by a small temperature change @xmath7 , which controls the equilibrium weight between coil and globule states . for small temperature changes and weak copolymerization , @xmath21 can now be expressed by a taylor - expansion viz . @xmath22 where the subscript 0 denotes the expansion around the electroneutral and salt - free reference state of the homopolymer at @xmath23 , @xmath24 . in our study this reference state is the pure poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) homopolymer . </S>",
    "<S> we expanded to second order in @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> as will become clearer in the remainder of the manuscript , it is also important to expand @xmath26 in specific copolymerization @xmath18 and salt concentration @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion in @xmath18 and @xmath20 considers _ nonelectrostatic _ effects on @xmath26 due to the specific change in chemical solvation thermodynamics upon copolymerization or the addition of salt , respectively . in other words , even for a neutral copolymer , copolymerization and the addition of salt will specifically change the lcst . </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning behind our expansion is illustrated also in the si for the convenience of the reader . </S>",
    "<S> all nonspecific , _ purely electrostatic _ charging and salt screening effects are included _ </S>",
    "<S> nonlinearly _ in the term @xmath5 which will be defined later .    using the thermodynamic relations @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the isobaric transition heat capacity , and defining the thermodynamic slopes @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and enforcing @xmath33 at the new lcst with value @xmath34 , it is @xmath35 we rearrange to obtain an explicit expression for the change in lcst @xmath36 where we have neglected heat capacity effects . the latter is a valid measure for small changes @xmath37 as is the case in our study . </S>",
    "<S> the full equation including a discussion of heat capacity effects is shown and discussed in the supplementary information ( si ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now estimate the purely electrostatic free energy change @xmath5 upon charging the copolymer in the solution with monovalent salt concentration @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we make the mean - field assumption that the collapsed copolymer globules can be modelled as homogeneous , compact entities with a mean monomer number density @xmath38 and the salty environment will readily lead to a complete electrostatic neutralization of the globule . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the free energy change is just based on the changes of ionic osmotic pressure , called the donnan pressure . </S>",
    "<S> given the globule with volume @xmath39 in contact with the salty reservoir at constant chemical potential , the free energy change per monomer is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the thermal energy , and @xmath42 is the net osmotic pressure inside the globule , that is , the difference between osmotic pressure inside the globule and bulk , respectively . for a simple salt at low concentration </S>",
    "<S> the ions can be well treated as an ideal gas and thus @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are the cation and anion concentration inside the globule , respectively , determined by the donnan potential @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter describes the difference between the electrostatic potentials in the globule and the reference bulk solution . </S>",
    "<S> it is determined by the electroneutrality condition @xmath46 which leads to @xmath47 where @xmath48 . with that we finally find for the purely electrostatic free energy change @xmath49 the final result for the change @xmath7 of the lcst in a monovalent salt reads @xmath50 where we abbreviated @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1st_order ] ) is the key equation derived in this work . for high salt concentrations or very small charge fractions ( @xmath52 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1st_order ] ) further simplifies to @xmath53 in the limit of very weak copolymerization and no ion - specific effects we can set @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , and one obtains a quadratic scaling with charge fraction @xmath6 and an inversely linear scaling in @xmath20 as @xmath57 which represents a limiting law for very weak perturbations by charge effects only . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it has the same scalings as mean - field descriptions of the second virial coefficient of polyelectrolytes .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    apart from the electrostatic external control parameters , such as the salt concentration @xmath20 and the charge fraction @xmath6 , the other determinants in the theory are intrinsic material constants specific to the _ neutral _ reference homopolymer , such as the lcst @xmath8 , the transition entropy per monomer @xmath58 , the globule density @xmath59 , and the specific changes induced by copolymerization and ions as expressed by @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss experimental values of those and our fitting procedure in the following .    </S>",

    "<S> higher order ion - specific effects are not important in this work but could be for more complex salts . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite for our salt kbr and pure pnipam , which is our reference polymer , this @xmath62-value has been measured and is @xmath64j / mol/(mol / l ) , i.e. to the slope @xmath65 k/(mol / l ) and @xmath66 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for our poly(nipam__-co-__evimbr ) we calculated this slope from the data at high salt concentrations ( @xmath67  m ) , where nonspecific charge effects have vanished , and find @xmath68  j / mol/(mol / l ) in very good agreement with the one in the pure pnipam system . </S>",
    "<S> the found @xmath62-value stays fixed in our fitting procedure .    from subtracting the specific ion effects ( @xmath63 ) from our experimental data </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lcst is @xmath69  k for the pnipam homopolymer reference state , independent of the the particular choice of copolymer fraction @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this lcst value is very close to the experimentally known lcst of pure pnipam of about @xmath70  k.  @xcite we conclude that specific copolymerization effects on the free energy are small for our system , that is , @xmath71 , and can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we keep the value of @xmath72  k fixed in our global fitting procedure .    </S>",
    "<S> the transition entropy per monomer @xmath73 for pure pnipam chains has been experimentally measured for various chain length with data summarized in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> i. the spread in the data is relatively narrow and we fix @xmath58 in our fitting procedure to the mean experimental value @xmath74  j / mol / k . </S>",
    "<S> previous experiments , however , show a very sensitive dependence of @xmath58 on functionalization .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this change is expressed in the parameter @xmath75 and depends on the specific chemical nature of the copolymerization . since measurements are unavailable , we will use @xmath61 as one of the global fitting parameters in our study .    </S>",
    "<S> .@xmath73 is the transition entropy per monomer of the pure pnipam homopolymer as collected from sources in the literature . </S>",
