    "the higher order derivative expansion is required especially for the analyses of many - body systems at higher temperature , because the multipole contribution to the correlation functions is significant for describing the decay of them .",

    ", our epac approximation can reproduce the long time oscillating behavior which originates from the quantum coherence of the system",
    ". therefore , the epac should be very effective for the system in which quantum coherence is significant , such as the quantum double well system considered here .",
    "we have also suggested that the epac method can be improved by the higher order derivative expansion , and have shown , as an example , the result of the second order improvement at zero temperature .",
    "it has been seen that this improvement procedure works very well for this example .    in this paper",

    "furthermore , it is interesting to find possible relationship between the effective potential - based methods of the present type and the other approaches to quantum dynamical correlations @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to pay attention to the fact that , for example , the effective potential - based quantum dynamics has been discussed in the context of the projection operator approach @xcite .",
    "finally we mention the direction of the applications of the epac to real molecular systems of chemical interest . from the results given in sec .",
    "iv , it is suggested that the epac should be very effective for the systems where quantum coherence plays an important role .",
    "for example , proton transfer reactions @xcite are typical phenomena of such category , because the small mass of proton makes quantum coherence significant even at room temperature . the epac will properly represent the quantum oscillating behavior accompanied with proton transfers .",
    "for example , for a molecular reaction system where the intrinsic reaction coordinate ( irc ) @xcite is well - defined , once the irc and the potential energy surface along it are provided , it is straightforward to calculate the approximate real time quantum correlation function by use of the epac method .",
    "however , for reactions occurring in solvents , not only the irc but the full quantum calculations treating many degrees of freedom should be implemented .",
    "for the application of the epac to such many - body systems including quantum coherence , more efficient sampling algorithms or novel approximation schemes must be developed to calculate the effective classical potentials needed in the epac .",

    "<S> we propose a new quantum dynamics method called the effective potential analytic continuation ( epac ) to calculate the real time quantum correlation functions at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the effective action formalism which includes the standard effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> the basic notions of the epac are presented for a one - dimensional double well system in comparison with the centroid molecular dynamics ( cmd ) and the exact real time quantum correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that both the epac and the cmd well reproduce the exact short time behavior , while at longer time their results deviate from the exact one . </S>",
    "<S> the cmd correlation function damps rapidly with time because of ensemble dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> the epac correlation function , however , can reproduce the long time oscillation inherent in the quantum double well systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the epac correlation function can be improved toward the exact correlation function by means of the higher order derivative expansion of the effective action . </S>"
