    "this paper highlights some of the applications of nuclear physics to problems in astrophysics .",
    "there are two primary reasons why nuclear physics plays a fundamental role in astrophysics : ( 1 ) nuclear reactions are an important source of energy and ( 2 ) nuclear reactions alter the isotopic composition of matter .",
    "the close connection between these research areas has a long history .",
    "the fields of experimental and theoretical astrophysics have experienced considerable progress in recent years which in turn has contributed to the vitality of nuclear astrophysics .",
    "we now have many probes of the universe and it s history .",
    "the photon spectrum contains a wealth of information , for example allowing measurements in optical and @xmath2-ray astronomy as well as of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "neutrinos from our sun and distant supernovae have now been detected ; the prospects for future measurements from these and other sources are most promising . in addition",
    "important information comes from cosmic rays and measurements of the isotopic composition of objects found within our solar system .",
    "several areas of current interest in nuclear astrophysics have recently been reviewed at the lake louise winter institute by hendrik schatz@xcite ( 2003 ) and richard boyd@xcite ( 2000 ) ; this review will mostly focus on somewhat different topics .",
    "the considerable progress in this field which has taken place since the seminal work for burbige , burbige , fowler , and hoyle@xcite in 1957 is summarized in the review by wallerstein _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "an important and common theme is that the observed elemental abundances in the universe can be understood to result from nuclear processing in big - bang , stellar , and cosmic - ray scenarios .",
    "we will begin with a discussion of big bang nucleosynthesis , which is responsible for the synthesis of the lightest elements .",
    "then some recent nuclear physics results relating to the production of neutrinos by our sun will be discussed .",
    "a discussion of explosive nucleosynthesis , such as takes place in novae and x - ray bursts , will follow next .",
    "we then cover some aspects of heavy - element nucleosynthesis and close out with a discussion of some aspects nuclear physics relevant to neutron stars .",
    ".cosmological parameters deduced from cmbr measurements@xcite . [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : bbn ]    comparisons between bbn calculations and observed abundances have been performed by several recent workers@xcite . for the most part the conclusions are in good agreement .",
    "burles _ et al._@xcite report a baryon - to - photon ratio of @xmath3 which is in good agreement with the value deduced from the cmbr discussed in the beginning of this section .",
    "this concordance is considered a major triumph for cosmology .",
    "there is however one aspect to this story which is somewhat puzzling : the observations of primordial lithium are only marginally consistent with the other abundances and the cmbr .",
    "if the lithium observations are taken by themselves , they would indicated a baryon - to - photo ratio of @xmath4 .",
    "although the origin of this discrepancy is not presently known , it may be an indication of new physics or some as yet unknown mechanism which has universally depleted the lithium in the old stars where it is measured .",
    "the experimental data are from ref.@xcite and the curves are theoretical calculations@xcite using different assumptions to generate the scattering wavefunctions.,width=384 ]",
    "nuclear physics also plays an important role in the production and detection of solar neutrinos .",
    "nuclear reactions in the core of our sun are both a source of energy and neutrinos . the relevant nuclear physics for neutrino production has been discussed in a recent review article@xcite .",
    "while it is possible to analyze solar neutrino measurements in manner which is independent of nuclear cross section assumptions@xcite , more information ( e.g. concerning neutrino properties ) can be deduced if the cross sections are understood . in the case of the @xmath6 reaction , we are dependent on theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions are particularly important for calculating the flux of neutrinos from the @xmath10 decays of @xmath11 and @xmath12 which in turn supply most of the signal measured at homestake ( chlorine ) , super kamiokande , and the sudbury neutrino observatory .",
    "the @xmath7 reaction has been measured recently in the laboratory at the relevant energies@xcite ; in the cases of @xmath8 and @xmath9 the cross section measurements must be extrapolated to lower energies . a solid theoretical and experimental understanding of these reactions is thus required .    as discussed by adelburger _",
    "et al._@xcite our present understanding of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 cross sections have not reached the desired level of precision .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath12 neutrino flux has been measured with an absolute uncertainty of less than 4%@xcite , while the predicted flux has a much greater uncertainty ( @xmath13% ) primarily due to nuclear physics@xcite . in the case of @xmath8 ,",
    "further experiments are planned , while the theoretical approach of nollett@xcite discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bbn ] helps to better understand the extrapolation to lower energies and the relationship to the mirror reaction . in the case of the @xmath9 reactions",
    "there have been several recent direct@xcite and indirect experiments@xcite .",
    "while these measurements have helped the situation , there are some disagreements between the various approaches  the indirect approaches seem to indicate a @xmath14% lower cross section than the direct measurements .",
    "it is hoped that additional experiments will clarify this situation .",
    "the reader is directed to the recent papers for further discussions and references to earlier experiments .",
    "we will next briefly discuss the role of nuclear physics in the detection of neutrinos via reactions on deuterium .",
    "they sudbury neutrino observatory has now detected both charged - current and neutral - current events from solar neutrinos reacting on deuterium@xcite which provide strong evidence for neutrino oscillations . in order to determine",
    "the neutrino fluxes it is necessary to to understand the @xmath15 reaction cross sections .",
    "calculations of the charged- and neutral - current cross sections have been carried out using two approaches .",
    "the first `` traditional '' method@xcite uses non - relativistic nuclear wavefunctions generated from nucleon - nucleon potentials along with one- and two - body current operators .",
    "the second method approach utilizes effective field theory@xcite .",
    "the two approaches agree at the level of 1% , providing considerable confidence in the calculated cross sections .",
    "there is presently a high level of interest in understanding the nuclear processes which take place in explosive environments such as novae and x - ray bursts@xcite . in explosive situations",
    "the nuclear reactions take place very quickly , often on a timescale much shorted than radioactive decay .",
    "it is then essential that nuclear reactions involving radioactive species be taken into account . in order to address these questions a number of radioactive - beam facilities",
    "have recently come on line and more are planned for the future .",
    "novae are understood to result in binary systems in which a white dwarf is accreting matter from its main - sequence companion star@xcite .",
    "once sufficient material has accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf a thermonuclear runaway ensues and the accreted material burns very quickly ( @xmath16  s ) .",
    "the luminosity of the system increases by a factor of @xmath17 during this time .",
    "in addition convection is predicted to bring the long - lived @xmath18-emitting nuclei to the surface where they may perhaps be seen by @xmath2-ray telescopes .",
    "x - ray bursters are a understood to result from a similar scenario in which the white dwarf is replaced by neutron star . in both scenarios the most important nuclear processes are proton- and @xmath1- capture reactions and @xmath18 decay .",
    "the rates of these processes are needed to understand the rate of energy production in novae and x - ray bursts as well as to understand the elements produced .",
    "we will now focus on novae ; for more information regarding x - ray bursts the reader is referred to the review of schatz@xcite .",
    "it is thought that novae produce a significant fraction of certain elements with @xmath19 , e.g. @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22@xcite .",
    "in addition they may produce detectable fluxes of @xmath2 rays from the decays of @xmath11 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the nuclear processing starts with the accreted material as well material dredged up from the white dwarf .",
    "this dredge - up material consists primarily of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 in the case of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 in the case of an oxygen - neon - magnesium dwarf@xcite .",
    "the reaction network generally lies along the proton - rich side of stability .",
    "the extent of the network and the nature of the cycling depends on the seed material and the temperature profile .",
    "= 4.1 in    considerable attention has recently been focused on reactions involving the isotopes @xmath30 and @xmath23 .",
    "these reactions are important for determining fluxes of 511-kev @xmath2 rays from @xmath23 and 1275-kev @xmath2 rays from @xmath31 .",
    "in addition beams of these isotopes have recently become available at argonne national laboratory and the holifield radioactive ion beam facility at oak ridge national laboratory ( ornl - hribf ) .",
    "the reaction @xmath32 has been studied indirectly by measuring the @xmath33 and @xmath34 reactions . in the former case the excitation energy and proton width of an important s - wave resonance",
    "were determined for the first time@xcite .",
    "while these parameters do not completely determine the reaction rate , they are of great importance as the rate is exponentially dependent on the resonance energy .",
    "the @xmath34 proton transfer reaction provides important information about the structure of bound states in @xmath35 which improves our understanding of the ( non - resonant ) direct capture process@xcite .",
    "it now appears that the direct capture mechanism dominates the reaction rate for nova temperatures ( @xmath36  k )",
    ". it would be highly desirable to measure directly the @xmath32 cross section , but the cross section very small .",
    "the first step of measuring this cross section at the peak of the aforementioned s - wave resonance appears feasible for the ornl - hribf facility .",
    "proton - induced reactions of @xmath23 have also been studied via the @xmath37 and @xmath38 reactions@xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : hribf ] these measurements accurately determine the several properties of the observed resonance : the resonance energy @xmath39  kev , the total width @xmath40  kev , the proton width @xmath41 , and the @xmath42 resonance strength @xmath43  kev .",
    "the reaction rate for the @xmath44 reaction is now known within 10% for @xmath45  gk , but is still uncertain for lower temperatures due to the uncertainties associated with low - energy resonances .",
    "although @xmath46 for the 665-kev resonance has net yet been determined it can be concluded that the @xmath44 reaction is much faster than the @xmath47 in both novae and x - ray bursters .    the best opportunity for observing a nuclear @xmath2-ray line produced by a nova appears to be with the 1275-kev line from @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath2-ray flux prediction depends on several reaction rates , including the proton - induced reactions of fluorine isotopes mentioned above .",
    "in addition , the @xmath48 reaction plays a very important role ( note that @xmath49 decays into @xmath31 ) .",
    "model calculations of oxygen - neon - magnesium novae@xcite indicate the uncertainty in the @xmath48 reaction rate is the dominant source of uncertainty in calculated 1275-kev @xmath2-ray flux .",
    "fortunately the strength of the key 206-kev resonance in this reaction was recently measured at the triumf - isac facilty@xcite .",
    "these measurements support the prediction that maximum detectability distance for the european space agency s integral spectrometer ( spi ) is approximately 1  kpc@xcite .",
    "the more abundant heavy nuclei are primarily synthesized by neutron capture reactions .",
    "these processes can be categorized into the `` slow '' and `` rapid '' neutron capture process , depending on how the neutron - capture timescale compares to the @xmath50 decay time .",
    "these mechanisms are dubbed the s - process and r - process , respectively .",
    "some proton - rich isotopes are thought to be synthesized by a succession of rapid proton captures ( rp - process ) . in addition",
    "other mechanisms including photodissociation and neutrino spallation also play a role@xcite . although certain parameters can be deduced from the observed abundances ,",
    "the sites of these nucleosynthetic processes is not always clear .",
    "many of these scenarios are likely associated with core - collapse supernovae ; however a unified description of these phenomena is still a work in progress .",
    "the main component of the s - process ( @xmath51 is relatively well - understood to occur in low - to - intermediate - mass [ @xmath52 thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars@xcite .",
    "the so - called weak component is produced in heavier @xmath53 stars which are burning helium in their cores . at the present time research in this area",
    "is focused on two major areas : ( 1 ) measurements of neutron capture cross sections and ( 2 ) better determinations of the neutron source reactions .",
    "particular attention is being focused on neutron capture cross sections on _ unstable _ isotopes in the s - process path . in some of these cases",
    "neutron capture can compete with @xmath50 decay .",
    "these branch points can provide important information about the neutron density during the s - process .",
    "the measurements are difficult because radioactive targets are involved , but efficient techniques for measuring cross sections with small samples are under development@xcite .",
    "the neutrons for the s - process are produced via the @xmath54 and @xmath55 reactions . at the temperatures involved in the s - process [ @xmath56  k ] the corresponding energies of the colliding nuclei are far below the coulomb barrier and the cross sections are very small very difficult if not impossible to measure directly .",
    "more experimental and theoretical work is needed to determine the rates of these reactions at astrophysical energies@xcite .",
    "the r - process is responsible for the peaks in the solar - system abundances seen at @xmath57 and  160 .",
    "these peaks are thought to result from the neutron shell closures and @xmath58 and  126 .",
    "nuclei consisting of a closed neutron shell plus one neutron have very low neutron separation energies and are much more likely to undergo @xmath59 reactions than further neutron captures .",
    "considerations of statistical equilibrium thus favor the build - up of abundances at the closed neutron shells .",
    "as the high - temperature environment cools the reactions fall out of equilibrium and the nuclei @xmath50 decay back to the stability line .",
    "although this general framework has been understood for a long time , the details concerning nuclear physics and the astrophysical site remain largely unknown .",
    "several possible sites for the r - process have been put forward , including neutron star mergers@xcite , the ejecta of core - collapse supernovae heated by neutrino wind@xcite , and in the accretion disks of neutron stars following core - collapse supernovae@xcite . at the present time",
    "the site remains an open question .",
    "measurements of the abundances of several r - process elements have recently been carried out in ultra - metal - poor halo stars@xcite .",
    "these stars show an r - process abundance pattern which closely matches the ( scaled ) solar r - process abundances , indicating that the r - process may be universal in nature .",
    "hardly any of the isotopes in the projected path of the r - process have been studied in the laboratory .",
    "knowledge of the neutron separation energies and half - lives are critical for determining the nature of the statistical equilibrium .",
    "the emission of @xmath10-delayed neutrons , fission , and the neutron - capture cross sections will impact the final abundance pattern@xcite . depending upon the site , neutrino oscillations may also have a very significant effect on the r - process@xcite . a new facility",
    "is has been proposed to be built in the united states , the rare isotope accelerator , would be able to produce the majority of the isotopes expected to be involved in the r - process .",
    "in addition to measurements of @xmath60-values and decay properties , other nuclear structure information such as level densities and @xmath2-ray strength functions can be determined which are important for estimating neutron capture cross sections@xcite .",
    "nuclear physics also plays an important role in neutron star interiors . of particular interest",
    "are the equation of state and cooling by neutrino emission .",
    "the nuclear equation of state largely determines the mass versus radius curve for neutron stars@xcite .",
    "since the core density of neutron stars is several times normal nuclear density , this environment provides unique tests of nuclear physics which can not be carried out in terrestrial laboratories . in principle",
    "the mass and radius are measurable so that the equation of state can be tested . at present many neutron star masses are accurately known , but there are no radius determinations  although there is promise for future measurements .",
    "interestingly the vast majority of measured neutron star masses are clustered around 1.4@xmath61 which may be an indication that neutron stars are usually formed with near - maximal mass .",
    "theoretical calculations@xcite indicate that the maximum possible neutron star mass is in the range @xmath62 even if rather exotic nuclear physics is allowed for . in light of the fact that radius determinations will soon be possible ,",
    "the prospects for an observational constraint on the nuclear equation of state are good@xcite .",
    "the ages and temperatures of neutron stars can be determined in many case by the morphology of the supernova remnant and x - ray spectra , respectively .",
    "the age versus temperature trajectory is closely related to cooling rate of neutron stars .",
    "of particular interest here are the neutrino - producing processes@xcite @xmath63 many - body effects are very important due to the extremely high densities in neutron star cores .",
    "it is very likely that the neutrons are in a superfluid state@xcite , and the effects of strong magnetic fields may be important@xcite .",
    "it is expected that the fruitful interplay between astronomy and few - nucleon dynamics will continue in the future as better observations and calculations become available .",
    "some applications of nuclear physics to big bang nucleosynthesis , solar neutrinos , explosive nucleosynthesis , the production of elements heavier than iron , and neutron stars have been reviewed .",
    "the future in all of these areas is very exciting as improved measurements of the elemental abundances , solar neutrino fluxes , galactic @xmath2 rays , and neutron star properties are planned . on the nuclear physics side new facilities such as",
    "the rare isotope accelerator will improve our understanding of the underlying nuclear physics .",
    "together these efforts will lead to a greater understanding of both our universe _ and _ nuclear physics .",

    "<S> nuclear physics has a long and productive history of application to astrophysics which continues today . </S>",
    "<S> advances in the accuracy and breadth of astrophysical data and theory drive the need for better experimental and theoretical understanding of the underlying nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> this paper will review some of the scenarios where nuclear physics plays an important role , including big bang nucleosynthesis , neutrino production by our sun , nucleosynthesis in novae , the creation of elements heavier than iron , and neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> big - bang nucleosynthesis is concerned with the formation of elements with @xmath0 in the early universe ; the primary nuclear physics inputs required are few - nucleon reaction cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleosynthesis of heavier elements involves a variety of proton- , @xmath1- , neutron- , and photon - induced reactions , coupled with radioactive decay . </S>",
    "<S> the advent of radioactive ion beam facilities has opened an important new avenue for studying these processes , as many involve radioactive species . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear physics also plays an important role in neutron stars : both the nuclear equation of state and cooling processes involving neutrino emission play a very important role . </S>",
    "<S> recent developments and also the interplay between nuclear physics and astrophysics will be highlighted . </S>"
