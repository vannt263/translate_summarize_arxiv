    "however , because of unfortunate placement behind considerable extinction , it has been difficult to get information on the system s true shape , orientation , breadth , etc .",
    "even the location of the structure s center ( presumably corresponding to a `` nucleus '' ) remains uncertain ; thus we refer to the entire system here as the galactic anticenter stellar structure ( gass ) .    the origin of gass",
    " originally described as a `` ring '' around the galaxy ( i03 , y03 )  is also not definitively established , with a number of potential scenarios outlined , e.g. , by i03 : a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy , an outer spiral arm , or ( their preference ) a resonance induced by an asymmetric galactic component . from among possibilities involving accretion , @xcite explore the extremes of dynamically young and old tidal debris , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c03 ) argue , as did y03 earlier , that the most straightforward interpretation is that gass is a disrupted satellite galaxy , resembling in many ways the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , m03 ) system . as evidence , c03 point to : ( 1 ) a velocity - longitude trend indicating a slightly non - circular orbit , ( 2 ) a velocity dispersion smaller than even that of thin disk stars , ( 3 ) a wide metallicity spread from [ fe / h ] @xmath5 ( y03 ) to at least @xmath6 dex , and ( 4 ) at least four star clusters apparently associated with the stream based on position _ and _ radial velocity ( rv ) .",
    "these clusters ( pal 1 , ngc 2808 , ngc 5286 , ngc 2298 ) , plus a fifth having no rv measurement ( bh 176 ) , lie in an unusual , arc - like configuration not seen elsewhere among low latitude , outer globular clusters ( gcs ) , but one resembling configurations expected for tidal debris systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several unusual gcs are identified by c03 as potential gass members .",
    "pal 1 is both very small ( @xmath7 ) and relatively metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) for an @xmath9 kpc gc .",
    "@xcite derive a pal 1 age of @xmath10 gyr and suggest it is either the youngest gc or one of the oldest open clusters ( ocs ) in the galaxy .",

    "coincident with gass , and find an interesting potential connection with the milky way ( mw ) old oc system .",
    "because bh 176 has no measured rv to check against the apparent @xmath14 trend of gass , observations of candidate bh 176 giant stars were obtained with the r - c spectrograph and 600 line mm@xmath15 grating ( 4.3   per resolution element ) on the ctio 1.5-m telescope on ut 2003 august 02 .",
    "three obvious stars along the bh 176 red giant sequence , redder than the typical field stars , and at the cluster center were selected from the ortolani et al .",
    "( 1995 , obb hereafter ) database . however , only the spectrum of the star at @xmath16(15:39:07.8,@xmath1750:03:11 ) proved of sufficient quality for a reliable rv .",
    "the spectrum from @xmath18   was cross - correlated against spectra of stars gl 803 ( spectral type m0 ) and gl 643 ( m3.5 ) , using both iraf s fxcor task and our own software ( c03 ) .",
    "weak mgh+mgb absorption in the spectrum of the target star strongly suggests that it is a giant ( of spectral type m2-m3 ) .",
    "an average @xmath19 km s@xmath15 is obtained , where a 30 km s@xmath15 error is estimated from the spread of results using different rv standards and software . while not highly precise , and of only one giant star in the cluster field , the @xmath20 for this star tantalizingly suggests ( if it is a bh 176 member ) that bh176 follows the @xmath14 trend of gass ( c03 ; see fig .  2 below ) .",
    "therefore , we include bh176 among more likely gass clusters .",

    "the four ocs with @xmath22 kpc  am-2 , tombaugh 2 , berkeley 29 and sau a  are _ also _ exceptional for lying in a string - like configuration ( large circles in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the unusual @xmath23 of the first three have long been recognized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* obb ) , but the extreme @xmath23 of sau a has only recently been noted @xcite .",
    "considering spatial biases in the known oc sample ( due , e.g. , to extinction ) , four clusters in one part of the sky might not be considered too unusual . however , these four extreme ocs also lie along the gass m giants ( see fig .  4 of r03 and fig .  1 of c03 ) and extend the spatial trend of the gass gcs from c03 . moreover , tombaugh 2 s measured rv , @xmath24 km s@xmath15 , places it squarely on the @xmath25 trend observed for gass stars and clusters ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "in addition , sau a @xcite and am-2 ( * ? ? ? *",
    "obb ) have ages and metallicities ( table 1 ) similar to pal 1",
    ". am-2 , like bh 176 and pal 1 , has been discussed as a possible `` transitional cluster '' ( tc ) by obb .",
    "these similarities strongly suggest these four  open \" clusters may also be associated with gass .    these nine `` primary '' gass candidate clusters  though spread over dozens of kiloparsecs , three galactic quadrants , and @xmath26 kpc ( table 1 gives adopted coordinates )  also lie close to a single , inclined plane : a least squares fit finds all nine within 2.35 kpc of @xmath27 , with an rms of only 1.39 kpc .",
    "because these nine clusters were first identified on the basis of their @xmath28 configuration ( though , admittedly , clusters with extreme @xmath21 were ruled out by c03 ) , and further winnowing of the sample relied only on available rvs ( c03 ) , there should be no reason to expect these clusters to lie as close to one plane as they do ; yet this rms is smaller than that for association to the _ galactic _ plane ( gp ) : 2.15 kpc .",
    "cohesion to this plane ( with pole @xmath29=[79.2 , -72.7]{\\arcdeg}$ ] ) is further support for dynamical association of these clusters .",

    "the alignment of the nine primary gass clusters can be extrapolated to search for additional associated clusters in the more crowded inner galactic regions .",
    "this exercise , while intended simply to identify other interesting possible members for future study , does turn up an interesting coincidence (  5 ) .",
    "for now we exclude consideration of : ( 1 ) the many clusters with @xmath96 kpc , many of which , by chance , fall near the gass cluster plane because its line of nodes with the gp lies nearby , and ( 2 ) the populous `` disk '' gc system with @xmath97 kpc . adopting this conservative `` volume of avoidance '' ( voa )",
    "is consistent with : ( 1 ) an expectation that , if tidal debris , gass must arc to the other side of the galactic center , and ( 2 ) a presumption , based on the @xmath28 distribution of the gass clusters and m giants , along with the c03 velocities , that the gass orbit is only slightly elliptical with perigalacticon @xmath98 kpc . a search through the cluster catalogues for other objects within 2.35 kpc of the best - fit plane ( 2.35 kpc is the largest deviation of the nine plane - defining clusters ) yields six more ocs and six more gcs .    the total sample of 21 clusters have an rms of only 1.03 kpc about the  3 plane , and represent an overdensity of clusters along any plane",
    "statistical tests of the parent sample and scrambled versions thereof find randomly placed planes to typically have only 8.2 clusters within 2.35 kpc .",
    "the cluster catalogues were scrambled to preserve the combined density law and discovery function ( and tested with the voa above ) : gcs were randomly rotated about the @xmath99-axis through the galactic center , preserving @xmath23 and @xmath21 , while ocs were randomly rotated about the @xmath21-axis , preserving @xmath21 and @xmath100 .",
    "the tests show that probability of finding 20 or more clusters in a poisson distribution with mean of only 8.2 is 0.04% .",
    "however , these statistics also suggest @xmath101 chance `` interlopers '' lie among the 21 clusters .",
    "seven of the new clusters have rvs useful to prune ( as in c03 ) to the most interesting candidates based on correlation to the previously found @xmath25 trend ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "thus , we `` demote '' as less likely to be associated the globulars ngc 6205 , ngc 6341 , ngc 6426 and ic 1257 and the oc berkeley 31 , but find the globulars ngc 6284 and ngc 6356 to nicely fall along the fig",
    ".  2 trend .",
    "the latter two gcs , together with the five new clusters without rvs plus nine primary gass clusters ( i.e. , all clusters in table 1 ) collectively define an asymmetric distribution in space : for example , 14 of the 16 clusters have @xmath102 and almost all define an arcing sequence in various fig .  1 projections , strengthening the impression of an inclined , tidal tail - like trail in three - dimensional space ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the seven new candidate clusters are actually _ even more _ tightly confined to the nominal plane ( rms @xmath103 kpc , and with all clusters within 1.3 kpc ) than are the nine clusters that defined it ( rms @xmath104 kpc ) ! the net rms about the  3 plane for all table 1 clusters is 1.15 kpc .    despite some affinity of the outer clusters for",
    "the gp , only 16 from the parent population have @xmath105 kpc , and these with a larger rms(@xmath21 ) @xmath106 kpc .",
    "thirteen of these 16 `` gp clusters '' overlap with the sample of 21 above .",
    "the probability of finding more than 21 clusters in a plane from a parent population whose average is 16 is 13.2% . while it might still be argued that the  3 plane merely reflects a concentration of clusters to the gp , given the",
    "_ stronger _ cluster alignment along the  3 plane , it seems a fair ( and as we show below , _ interesting _ ) exercise to at least consider the converse supposition .",
    "how the relatively high @xmath21-distributed , old oc system was formed has remained a challenging problem . among the two most plausible models",
    ", @xcite concludes that old oc creation during evolution of the mw disk requires `` fine tuning '' of formation and destruction processes , whereas in accretion `` one finds a natural mechanism for open cluster formation '' , particularly the high @xmath107 ocs . in this context",
    "we find several interesting coincidences regarding the 15 known oc / tc objects with @xmath108 kpc and @xmath109 kpc : ( 1 ) remarkably , 13 of these 15 clusters are confined to the third and fourth galactic quadrants , something that would occur by chance only 4.3% of the time .",
    "such a lopsided distribution is easily accommodated by an accretion origin , but not by a disk formation model .",
    "( 2 ) eleven of these 15 clusters are among the gass candidate clusters in table 1 , while one more , berkeley 22 , lies right in the m giant gass tracing by r03 and would have been included in our sample had we used a planar distance limit only 20 pc larger .",
    "although clearly old ( 0.7 to 7 gyr ) for ocs , the table 1 tc / oc objects are generally poorly studied and have unknown rvs ; their proposed association with one another and with the gass field star overdensities must therefore be considered tentative .",
    "nevertheless , their arcing spatial sequence and planar alignment (  4 ) is tantalizingly suggestive of an origin relating to the interaction of a satellite galaxy with the mw .",
    "an alternative view might hold that the arcing spatial sequence of star clusters and the correlated overdensities of field stars defining gass merely represent an outer mw spiral arm . however , if a spiral arm , it is strangely inclined by 17@xmath110 to the gp .",
    "additionally , spiral arms characteristically have _ young _",
    "star clusters , yet no table 1 cluster is younger than 0.67 gyr .",
    "there is also no gass correlation with the galactic warp ( c03 ) .",
    "on the other hand , star clusters in the fornax ( for ) and sgr satellite galaxies have sizes and luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that span those of the typical old oc @xcite and table 1 objects ; that for and sgr clusters are called `` globular '' seems mainly to reflect a difference in age , but _",
    "young _ clusters of similar @xmath111 are prevalent @xcite in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) . under the premise that the table 1 objects represent the cluster system of a dwarf galaxy , one can use them to explore the age - metallicity relation ( `` amr '' ) of that putative system .",
    "3 shows an amr typical of that expected for an independently evolving , `` closed - box '' system with protracted star formation ( compare fig .  3 to the similar amr of sgr field stars and clusters in fig .",
    "18 of * ? ? ?",
    "apart from bh 176 , the fig .  3 ,",
    "outer tc / oc clusters show a relatively tight amr ( even including be 22 ) , especially compared to that for _ all _ old mw ocs ( e.g. , fig .  8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in comparison to the lmc cluster amr ( e.g. , fig .",
    "2a of * ? ? ?",
    "a large metallicity spread among these clusters mimics the spread among non - cluster gass stars discussed by c03 .",
    "together , the various ensemble properties of the gass clusters lend further circumstantial support to the `` tidal debris '' explanation for gass . however , while sharing a similar overall amr to sgr , gass appears to have star clusters much younger than in the mw - accreting cluster system of sgr , for which the youngest and most metal - rich known cluster is terzan 7 ( age @xmath112 gyr , [ fe / h ] @xmath113 ; layden & sarajedini 2000 ) .",
    "clearly such differences in the selective production and/or destruction of clusters within mw satellites is not a problem since differences in the distribution of cluster ages are already observed between the systems in for , sgr and the mcs , all galaxies with continuing star formation up to the near present .",
    "but the lower inclination and apparently smaller orbit of gass compared to these other mw satellites suggests consideration of an additional mechanism for the constant production of new star clusters through the continuous interaction of a `` gasseous '' dwarf galaxy with the gaseous disk of the mw ."
