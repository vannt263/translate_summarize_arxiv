    "the phase transition process of non - crystalline materials from a glassy to molten state has remained an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics especially when these materials are confined in nanometer length scale .",
    "this is a subject of intense research for macromolecules like polymers as the confinement effect becomes prominent even in films having thickness of tens of nanometers .",
    "the effect of nano - confinement on the glass transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) of ultrathin polymer films is being studied extensively @xcite as the results may influence our basic understanding about glass transition mechanism in general @xcite and dynamics of polymer chains near glass - melt transition , in particular @xcite .",
    "these studies are also important for technological applications of nanometer - thick polymer films @xcite . in most of these investigations",
    "the thicknesses of polymer films are measured using ellipsometry technique @xcite as a function of temperature across glass - melt transition .",
    "the @xmath0 in these measurements was defined @xcite using temperatures at which thermal expansion deviates from linearity above ( @xmath1 ) and below ( @xmath2 ) the glass transition with @xmath0 = 0.5 ( @xmath3 ) . in ellipsometry measurements , @xmath1 were found to be constant and @xmath2 exhibited rapid reduction as the thicknesses of the polymer films approached 10 nm | a thickness below which @xmath0 could not be determined from thickness measurements due to contrast problem @xcite . as @xmath1 was constant , both broadening of glass transition @xmath4 (= @xmath5 ) and @xmath0 itself were found to follow the variation of @xmath2 with thickness in polystyrene thin films .",
    "it was assumed that for thin polymer films a top layer of thickness around 5 nm is in molten state even at room temperature .",
    "the effect of the molten top free surface on reduction of @xmath0 has been confirmed by capping the polymer films by a metal layer @xcite .",
    "the measurements were performed on primarily polystyrene films having thickness between 10 to 100 nanometer and the values of @xmath0 thus obtained from various different measurements could be parameterized with an empirical relation @xmath6\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are glass transition temperatures for bulk polymer and for a film of thickness _",
    "h _ respectively @xcite .",
    "this equation obviously indicates finite @xmath0 above a thickness a and its value was found to be 3.2 nm . it is indeed very interesting to note that except one data set @xcite , large number of measurements @xcite performed in different experimental conditions with variety of surface treatments of silicon substrates , which were used for depositing polystyrene films of various molecular weights , followed this empirical relation with a = 3.2 nm and @xmath9 = 1.8 .",
    "the implication of this intriguing result is that a film of 3.2 nm will not show finite @xmath0 and even for a 8 nm film @xmath8 will be below room temperature .",
    "our results however exhibit evidence of glass transition for films having even 4 nm thickness and the obtained value of @xmath8 remains close to @xmath7 though transition becomes broad as the thickness is reduced .",
    "we also demonstrate that one has to use the concept of distributed glass transition temperature @xcite to explain the dramatic increase in @xmath4 as the thickness becomes comparable to the radius of gyration ( @xmath10 ) of the polymer . in a recent calorimetric measurement ,",
    "ultrathin ( 1 to 10 nm ) polymer films exhibited @xcite pronounced glass transition temperature and this measurement also showed minor change in @xmath0 with thickness but confirmed the broadening of glass transition with reduction of film thickness , which is in agreement with our findings . moreover , the results presented here are consistent with the earlier thickness measurement studies using conventional x - ray reflectivity and ellipsometry techniques except for the films less than 20 nm for which sensitivity of earlier thickness measurements were not satisfactory @xcite .",
    "we have studied thermal expansion behaviour of spin coated ultrathin poly - styrene films in the thickness range of 4 to 31 nm . polystyrene ( aldrich , usa , @xmath11 = 212,400 , radius of gyration @xmath10@xmath1212.6 nm and @xmath7 = 373k ) thin films were deposited by spin coating solutions of the polymer in toluene at around 3000 rpm onto hydrophilic silicon ( 100 ) substrates prepared following rca cleaning procedure . in this chemical treatment , substrates were first heated with 30% ammonium hydroxide ( @xmath13 ) and 30% hydrogen peroxide ( @xmath14 ) solution ( 1:1 volume ratio ) for 10 minutes followed by a rinsing with acetone and alchohol and finally washed with purifies water having 18.2 mohm cm resistivity ( millipore , usa ) .",
    "the film thickness was controlled by changing the rotation speed and by choosing appropriate concentration of the solution from 1 - 6.5 mg / ml of toluene .",
    "it is known that any property of polymer films determined through thickness measurements is sensitive to dewetting phenomena and one has to be careful especially for ultrathin polymer films @xcite .",
    "we present here results of polymer films deposited on hydrophilic silicon ( 100 ) substrate , which do not show any dewetting even after repeated thermal cycling .",
    "the polymer films were heated in a sample cell under vacuum ( 3@xmath15 10@xmath16 mbar ) at a temperature ( 403k ) above @xmath7 of ps and we have monitored the top surface of the film with optical microscope .",
    "we have performed these measurements for both thick and ultrathin ps films down to 4.3 nm range reported here . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the obtained adr profiles and corresponding fits are presented as a function of temperature for a 4.3 nm thick polymer film . from our analysis",
    ", it is seen that the roughness values of this film of 4.3 nm thickness measured at 303 k and 403 k come out to be 2.8    and 3.3    respectively ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) and we could get back same parameter after repeated thermal cycling .",
    "dewetting of film would have increased the roughness drastically @xcite and we could not have got back same reflectivity profile after thermal cycling .",
    "we have also performed energy dispersive x - ray spectrometry measurements on chemically treated silicon substrate and the polymer films . in the inset of fig .",
    "1(a ) , part of edx spectra of a substrate and polymer film collected at 5 kev energy in scanning electron microscope are shown to indicate that the film is free from other contaminants and our impression is that clean environment should be used to avoid dewetting of the polystyrene films deposited on hydrophilic silicon substrates .",
    "we have studied the in - plane correlation present in polymer films by measuring transverse x - ray diffuse scattering as a function of temperature at x22c beamline of national synchrotron light source , brookhaven national laboratory . in fig .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) we have shown data collected at two temperatures as a function of @xmath17 $ ] at three fixed @xmath18 $ ] values , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are incidence and exit angle of x - rays of wavelength @xmath21 .",
    "capillary waves are of particular importance in case of soft matter interfaces and polymer films are known @xcite to exhibit charactaristic of capillary wave correlation @xcite . from theory of capillary waves ,",
    "the height - height correlation function can be expressed as @xmath22    where @xmath23 is modified bessel function , @xmath24 is low wave vector cut off and @xmath25 with @xmath26 as the surface tension at temperature t and @xmath27 = 1.3806 @xmath15 10@xmath28",

    "1(b ) and ( c ) ) with this line shape . from our analysis ,",
    "the values of b come out to be 1.1   @xmath34 and 2.1   @xmath34 for 333 k and 393 k respectively .",
    "dewetting of films would have generated different line shapes as observed earlier @xcite .",
    "we find that the films retain this line shape through thermal cycling confirming that dewetting is not taking place .",
    "thermal expansion studies of the polymer thin films were carried out in the temperature range of 308 k to 433 k using both energy ( edr ) and angle ( adr ) dispersive x - ray reflectivity techniques @xcite . in specular condition , the intensity of reflected x - ray beam is measured as a function of wave vector transfer @xmath35 with hc = 12.3986 kev   ) where the incident and exit angle @xmath36 are kept equal .",
    "the adr experiments were performed by changing the angle @xmath36 in a laboratory set up @xcite and the edr measurements were carried out at the edr beamline @xcite of bessy - ii synchrotron ( berlin , germany ) by keeping the angle @xmath36 constant ( 1@xmath37 here ) .",
    "all the reflectivity measurements both in angle and energy dispersive mode were carried out keeping the samples in vacuum ( 10@xmath16 mbar ) .",
    "we have already demonstrated @xcite that the polymer films deposited on hydrophilic si(100 ) substrate exhibit reversible negative and positive thermal expansion below and above @xmath7 respectively .",
    "our observation has been confirmed in an independent measurement and predicted large relaxation time has also been measured @xcite .",
    "negative thermal expansion was also observed in polycarbonate ultrathin film while cooling the films below apparent @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the existence of positive and negative thermal expansion @xcite coefficients above and below @xmath0 improved the sensitivity of measurement of glass transition temperature .",
    "moreover , we used here the edr technique , which allowed us to collect large number of reflectivity profiles around @xmath7 in quick succession .",
    "edr technique is ideal method to investigate small thermal expansion in thin polymer films . in fig .",
    "2 we have shown the measured adr and edr profiles collected from a polymer film at room temperature along with the fit giving us a thickness of 4.5 nm . the procedure of edr data extraction and other experimental details of edr beamline of bessy - ii synchrotron has been described earlier @xcite .",
    "we have also shown some of the representative edr profiles at three different temperatures along with the fitted curves in the inset of fig .",
    "the change in thickness is apparent in the shift of minimum of reflectivity curves itself . in the analysis @xcite of normalized edr and adr data ,",
    "we have used a model of a polymer film of constant electron density with two roughness profiles at film - air and film - substrate interfaces . the obtained thickness as a function of temperature for this film",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "initially , the 4.5 nm ps film showed negative thermal expansion with the coefficient of -3.7@xmath15 10@xmath38 k@xmath39 over @xmath1230 k temperature range starting from 308 k. near @xmath12339 k , negative thermal expansion decreases to give rise to a flat region up to @xmath12408 k in the thickness vs. temperature curve . above @xmath12408",
    "k , the film thickness increases and the resultant expansion coefficient comes to be 2.5@xmath15 10@xmath38 k@xmath39 , much greater than that of bulk ps @xcite .",
    "the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 were determined by fitting two straight lines at high and low temperature region respectively as shown in the fig .",
    "the calculated @xmath8 obtained from 0.5 ( @xmath3 ) ( indicated as @xmath40 ) and from the intersection of the two fitted lines as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) were found to be very close for all the films . in fig .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) we have shown results of the films having room temperature thickness of 5.7 nm and 23.1 nm respectively .",
    "we find that values of @xmath8 remains very close to that for the bulk polymer @xmath7 for all films but broadening of glass transition @xmath41 reduces as the film thickness increases .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that for ultrathin films one can expect two types of diffusion processes , the first one is standard motions controlled by the free volume and the second one is sliding ( _ reptation _ ) motions for chains having end points at the free surface .",
    "one can expect increase in the sliding motions for molecules having centre of mass near surface giving rise to decrease in @xmath0 towards free surface of a film . in a recent fluorescence measurement of multilayer polymer films , systematic reduction of @xmath0",
    "was observed for the molecules close to free surface @xcite .",
    "we have used this concept for explaining observed thickness variation with temperature and large broadening ( @xmath4 ) of glass transition . in our simple model",
    ", we have assumed that a film is composed of small pseudo - layers of equal thickness having different glass transition temperatures ( @xmath0 ) . each of these pseudo - layers continues to show negative thermal expansion up to the corresponding @xmath0 , independent of other pseudo - layers and then expands giving rise to positive thermal expansion .",
    "the negative and positive thermal expansion coefficients in each of these pseudo - layers were kept equal to that of the total film .",
    "the @xmath0 -s , obtained from best fit of the measured curve corresponding to the @xmath0 of six pseudo - layers used here for the 4.5 nm and 5.7 nm ps films , are indicated in the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) . the generated curve by adding all these six pairs of straight line match quite well with experimental data .",
    "the fit can be improved by using more number of pseudo - layers but the basic feature is quite clear even in this simple model . in case of 23.1 nm film ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) we used five pseudo - layers instead of six as @xmath42 has reduced significantly .",
    "the molecules near surface have enhanced probability of sliding motion and thereby lower effective @xmath0 .",
    "effective @xmath0 of pseudo - layers progressively approach bulk value @xmath7 as the position of the pseudo - layer lowers and this value becomes even more than @xmath7 for the pseudo - layer situated near film substrate interface due to strong interaction between polymer and substrate . in our model ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 are effective @xmath0 of the top and bottom pseudo - layers in each film .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath8 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for all the films are shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we have presented obtained absolute value of thermal expansion ( @xmath43 ) both below and above @xmath0 and the extracted @xmath4 for the five ps films of different thicknesses .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath43 in these films decreases exponentially as the film thickness is increased and from @xmath12 2@xmath10-thick ps films , the thermal expansion above @xmath0 become close to the volume expansion of bulk ps as observed earlier @xcite .",
    "the broadening of glass transition @xmath4 also exhibit an exponential dependence and we could parameterized all the curves with a function @xmath44 + a_3 $ ] .",
    "the values of fitting parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 for negative and positive thermal expansion coefficients come out to be 4.1@xmath15 10@xmath16 k@xmath39 , 1.8 nm , 2.2@xmath15 10@xmath48 k@xmath39 and 5.6@xmath15 10@xmath38 k@xmath39 , 4.4 nm , 4.5@xmath15 10@xmath48 k@xmath39 respectively . for the @xmath4 data , we obtain these parameters as 85.46 k , 10.8 nm and 15.1 k respectively .    in fig .",
    "4(a ) we have also shown variation of @xmath8 with thickness and found that there is a reduction of 7 k as the thickness of the film is reduced to 4 nm with an error bar around 3 k. our results agree with the calorimetric results @xcite which indicated no appreciable dependence of glass - transition temperature on film thickness .",
    "in fact one averaged value of @xmath0 for the ultrathin films having large @xmath4 is an ill - defined parameter . referring back to eq .",
    "( 1 ) and its remarkable success in explaining large number of ellipsometry results , we note that this equation represents essentially variation of @xmath2 as @xmath1 was found to be constant in ellipsometry measurements .",
    "we extracted the values of @xmath2 as a function of thickness from the published values @xcite of @xmath8 knowing the constant values of @xmath1 in those ellipsometry measurements .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath2 are shown with the obtained values of @xmath2 from our measurements in the inset of fig .",
    "4(a ) . excluding the present data",
    ", one can indeed get respective values of _ a _ and @xmath9 as 3.76 @xmath49 0.88 nm and 1.76 @xmath49 0.35 , by fitting ( dashed line ) the eq .",
    "( 1 ) as reported @xcite . for fitting the data set over the entire thickness range shown in inset of fig .",
    "4(a ) with the eq . ( 1 ) one has to ignore the earlier measured ellipsometry data below 20 nm that had problem of contrast @xcite .",
    "we obtained the values of 0.47 @xmath49 0.21 nm and 1.13 @xmath49 0.23 for _ a _ and @xmath9 respectively from this fitting ( solid line ) .",
    "it may be noted that the obtained value of _ a _ here is close to the segment length of polystyrene 0.67 nm indicating that polymer film of finite thickness will always have finite @xmath2 .",
    "moreover increase in @xmath1 for ultrathin films will keep @xmath8 close to @xmath7 .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown by measuring thickness of ultrathin polystyrene films as a function of temperature that conventional glass transition takes place even for a 4.5 nm film and we do not observe an appreciable dependence of average @xmath0 as a function of thickness .",
    "we find large broadening of glass transition temperature occur as the film thickness reduces below radius of gyration .",
    "we could explain this broadening by invoking continuous glass transition temperature as a function of depth arising due to variation of the contribution of sliding motion in the diffusion process .",
    "probability of having _ ends _ of a polymer chain at the free surface , the essential requirement for sliding motion , increases as the centre of mass of the chain comes closer to the free surface @xcite giving rise to lowest but finite @xmath0 , marked as @xmath2 in a film .",
