    "transverse single - spin and azimuthal asymmetries in high - energy hadronic reactions have raised a lot of interest in the last years ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "huge spin asymmetries have been measured in the inclusive forward production of pions in high - energy @xmath2 collisions at moderately large transverse momentum .",
    "the general trend of the early pioneer measurements of the e704 collaboration at fermilab  @xcite has been recently confirmed at much larger center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratories ( bnl ) in similar kinematical configurations  @xcite .",
    "a surprisingly large transverse polarization of @xmath3 hyperons produced in the forward region was also measured in unpolarized @xmath2 , @xmath4 fixed - target experiments , see e.g. ref .",
    "also in this case it will be hopefully possible in the near future to check if this intriguing effect survives at the much larger energies reachable at rhic and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "similar effects , leading to azimuthal asymmetries both in the polarized and unpolarized case , have been measured in drell - yan ( dy ) processes  @xcite , in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis )  @xcite , and in hadron - pair production in @xmath5 collisions  @xcite .",
    "these results can not be explained at leading - twist ( lt ) approximation in the usual collinear approach of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , based on factorization theorems , to inclusive particle production in hadronic collisions . here",
    "collinear means that intrinsic parton motion is neglected in the hard scattering processes and integrated over up to the large energy scale in the soft functions involved . on the contrary , at least in the kinematical regimes under consideration at rhic ,",
    "collinear next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd gives a fair account of unpolarized cross sections ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "two different main theoretical approaches have been proposed in the framework of perturbative qcd in order to account for these measurements .",
    "one is the so - called twist - three collinear approach , which generalizes the leading order ( lo ) collinear framework with the inclusion of higher - twist quark - gluon correlations  @xcite .",
    "this involves a new class of universal nonperturbative twist - three quark - gluon distribution and fragmentation functions that need to be modeled by fitting experimental data .",
    "another formalism , which will be adopted in this paper , is the so - called transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) approach , which takes into account spin and intrinsic parton motion effects .    although the large single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) of interest here were originally observed in single inclusive particle production in hadronic collisions , it is now clear that from the theoretical point of view these are not the cleanest processes to consider",
    ". first of all , these ssas are twist - three effects in a series expansion in inverse powers of the large energy scale ( here , the transverse momentum of the observed single hadron or jet ) .",
    "several competing mechanisms can therefore play a role and mix up .",
    "moreover , in the tmd formalism factorization has not yet been proved for these processes and its validity is much under debate presently , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for inclusive two - hadron production .",
    "factorization breaking would in turn imply non universality of the soft tmd distribution and fragmentation functions required to explain data . in the case of single particle production in hadronic collisions , therefore , the tmd approach can be seen at present as a useful generalization of the parton model where factorization is assumed as a reasonable starting point to be carefully scrutinized by comparison with available experimental results .    as mentioned above ,",
    "similar spin and azimuthal asymmetries were subsequently observed in sidis and dy processes , where two energy scales are involved , the required large energy scale ( the momentum transfer @xmath6 in sidis , the lepton - pair invariant mass , @xmath7 , in dy ) allowing use of pqcd , and a small energy scale sensitive to intrinsic parton motion ( the transverse momentum respectively of the final lepton pair in dy and of the produced hadron in sidis ) . for these classes of processes both the twist - three collinear formalism and a full gauge invariant tmd approach",
    "have been developed and factorization has been proven  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that when the value of the small observed scale is intermediate between the typical qcd nonperturbative scale and the large factorization scale , the two approaches are mutually consistent  @xcite .    in the tmd approach",
    "to dy(sidis ) processes color gauge invariance is ensured by the inclusion of gauge links ( wilson lines ) , accounting for initial(final ) state interactions among the struck partons involved in the hard process and the remnants of the parent hadrons ( additional final state interactions are also present in the fragmentation process ) .",
    "single - spin and azimuthal asymmetries are generated by tmd polarized partonic distribution and fragmentation functions , among which the most relevant from a phenomenological point of view are the sivers distribution  @xcite and , for transversely polarized quarks , the boer - mulders distribution  @xcite and the collins fragmentation function  @xcite ( similar functions can be defined for linearly polarized gluons , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for inclusive forward pion production the large transverse single spin asymmetry observed can be generated both by the sivers and the collins effects ; unfortunately these contributions can not be disentangled and one has to consider alternative measurements in order to separate the different mechanisms .",
    "this is at variance with the case of sidis and dy processes , where the sivers and collins effects ( and several other possible contributions to the azimuthal asymmetries ) can be disentangled . in hadronic collisions",
    "one has to resort to different processes , like e.g.  the dy process ( no fragmentation ) , single photon or jet production , two particle(jet ) production with transverse momentum imbalance and so on .    from this point of view ,",
    "a very interesting process is @xmath8 , where one observes a large @xmath0 jet and looks for the azimuthal distribution of leading pions inside the jet . in this case",
    ", one should observe a symmetric pion distribution for the fragmentation of an unpolarized parton jet , and a @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , distribution for a transversely(linearly ) polarized quark(gluon ) parton jet ( @xmath11 indicates the azimuthal angle of the leading pion distribution around the jet axis ) .",
    "therefore , despite the complexity of the measurement ( which is however at reach and presently under active investigation at rhic ) , this process might offer plenty of new information as compared to single inclusive pion production .",
    "it would in principle allow us to disentangle the contributions coming from the sivers and the collins effects .",
    "other contributions involving different combinations of tmd distribution and fragmentation functions could also be disentangled .",
    "finally , it could also help in identifying jets coming from quark or gluon fragmentation , since the pion azimuthal distribution is different in the two cases . at rhic kinematics",
    "a careful tuning of the kinematical configuration considered can help from this point of view .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we will present , in the approach of the tmd generalized parton model , and allowing for intrinsic parton motion both in the initial colliding hadrons and in the fragmentation process ( which is crucial ) , the general expression for the polarized cross section for the process @xmath12 , and the structure of the azimuthal asymmetries that can be measured in the distribution of leading pions around the jet thrust axis ( coinciding in our scheme with the final scattered parton direction of motion ) .",
    "a very preliminary version of this study was first presented in ref .",
    "a similar analysis was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which however considered intrinsic parton motion only in the fragmentation process , drastically reducing the possible contributions to the asymmetry .",
    "indeed , in that case , only the collins effect for quarks is at work .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite aimed at studying only the collins fragmentation function ( ff ) , which should be universal , in a more simplified theoretical scheme for which factorization has been proven .",
    "our approach is different in some respects .",
    "it is more general and has in principle a richer structure in the observable azimuthal asymmetries , since intrinsic motion is taken into account in the initial hadrons also .",
    "however , since factorization has not been proven in this case , but is rather taken as a reasonable phenomenological assumption , the validity of the scheme and the universality of the tmd distributions involved require an even more severe scrutiny by comparison with experimental results . on the other hand , at the present theoretical and experimental stage , we believe that combined phenomenological tests of different approaches are required to clarify the validity of factorization and , related to this , the relevance of possible universality - breaking terms for the tmd distributions .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sect .",
    "[ sec - formalism ] we will summarize the tmd generalized parton model approach , which has been presented and discussed at length in a series of papers , see e.g.  refs .",
    "we will then present the expression of the polarized cross section for the process of interest , discussing in detail the different partonic contributions to the process ; we will finally list the azimuthal asymmetries that can be measured and their physical content . in sect .",
    "[ sec - results ] we will present phenomenological results for the azimuthal asymmetries discussed in the kinematical configuration of the rhic experiments , at different c.m .  energies and for central and forward rapidity jet production . in particular , we will first present results for the totally maximized effects , by taking all tmd functions saturated to natural positivity bounds and adding in sign all possible partonic contributions .",
    "this will assess the potential phenomenological relevance of each effect .",
    "we will then consider more carefully those effects involving the sivers and boer - mulders distributions and the collins fragmentation function , for which phenomenological parameterizations obtained by fitting combined data for azimuthal asymmetries in sidis , drell - yan and @xmath5 collisions are available .",
    "section  [ sec - conclusions ] contains our final remarks and conclusions .",
    "in this section we present and summarize the expressions of the polarized cross section and of the measurable azimuthal asymmetries for the process @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are typically a @xmath2 or @xmath16 pair . since most of the formalism has been already presented in refs .",

    "@xmath29 is the helicity density matrix of parton @xmath28 .",

    "( [ kpi - cm ] ) we easily see that @xmath59    notice that , for central - rapidity jets ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 . therefore ,",
    "azimuthal asymmetries modulated in terms of @xmath62 are artificially suppressed in the central rapidity region , while the physically relevant angle is @xmath50 . instead , in the forward rapidity region , when @xmath63 , the two angles are practically coincident .",
    "notice also that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the forward rapidity region was considered , the angle @xmath62 ( called @xmath64 there ) was adopted .",
    "let us now come back to the soft tmd partonic distribution and fragmentation functions entering the differential cross section for the process @xmath65 , eq .",
    "( [ ds - pi - jet ] ) .",
    "consider first the polarized soft process at the distribution level , @xmath66 ; as said , in eq .",
    "( [ ds - pi - jet ] ) all information on this process is encoded in the factor @xmath27 .",
    "this factor depends on the polarization state ( fixed by experimental conditions ) of the parent hadron @xmath14 , described by its own helicity density matrix @xmath67 , and on generalized soft distribution functions for the process @xmath66",
    ", @xmath68 : @xmath69 the functions @xmath70 are related to the well - known leading - twist hand - bag diagram for deeply inelastic scattering .",
    "analogous relations hold for parton @xmath30 inside the ( un)polarized hadron @xmath15 .",
    "rotational invariance and parity conservation for strong interactions imply some very general relations for these nonperturbative functions : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the azimuthal angle of parton @xmath28 intrinsic transverse momentum , @xmath73 , in the parent hadron @xmath14 helicity frame ( coinciding in the present case with the hadronic c.m .",
    "notice that the _ reduced _ soft functions @xmath74 on the right - hand side ( without the hat ) do not depend anymore on azimuthal phases .",
    "moreover , @xmath75 where @xmath35 and @xmath76 are the spins of the parent hadron and of the parton respectively . notice that for spin 1/2 colliding hadrons , @xmath77 , the factor @xmath78 is positive(negative ) for quark(gluon ) partons , and therefore some parity properties of the soft functions are different for quarks and gluons . by combining complex conjugation and parity properties",
    ", one can show that some of these functions are purely real or purely imaginary . as a result , for spin 1/2 hadrons only eight independent soft distributions survive at leading twist .",
    "they can be easily related to the tmd distributions widely discussed in the literature . before listing them for completeness ,",
    "let us recall another important property of the hadronic functions @xmath79 , coming from total angular momentum conservation in the forward direction , that is for @xmath80 : @xmath81 where @xmath7 is a typical hadronic mass scale and the @xmath82 s stay for the remaining part of the functions that , depending on the details of dynamics , may or may not vanish in the collinear configuration .",
    "the relevant hadronic functions and their connection with the leading - twist tmd distributions is therefore , in the quark case ( for clarity we adopt here both the notation of ref .  @xcite and that of the amsterdam group  @xcite ) @xmath83    analogous relations hold for gluon partons with the changes discussed above , due to the different spin of the parton and leading to different parity properties .",
    "notice that instead of transversely polarized quarks we will have linearly polarized gluons . of course , the same relations hold also for the @xmath84 process . however , this time the @xmath85 and @xmath86 axes of hadron @xmath15 helicity frame are opposite to those of the hadronic c.m .",
    "concerning the fragmentation process , since here we are considering only pions ( in general , unpolarized hadrons ) , the discussion of the soft fragmentation functions , @xmath87 , is much simplified . in practice ,",
    "only two independent tmd fragmentation functions survive : one with diagonal parton helicity indexes , related to the tmd unpolarized ff , @xmath88 and a second one with off - diagonal parton helicity indexes , @xmath89 .",
    "this second function is purely imaginary for quark partons and is related to the well - known collins function  @xcite , describing the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into a non collinear unpolarized hadron . instead , for gluon partons",
    "the analogous collins - like function is purely real and is related to the fragmentation of linearly polarized gluons again into an unpolarized hadron .",
    "it is very important to realize that these off - diagonal quark and gluon tmd ffs have different behaviours as a function of the azimuthal angle of the observed pion around the direction of motion of the fragmentation jet .",
    "more specifically , for quarks we have : @xmath90 while for gluons the analogous relation reads @xmath91 as mentioned above , the azimuthal independent parts of these tmd ffs are related to the probability for a transversely(linearly ) polarized quark(gluon ) of fragmenting into a non collinear unpolarized hadron , the collins(collins - like for gluons ) fragmentation function  @xcite , @xmath92    again , total angular momentum conservation in the forward direction dictates the power behaviour of the tmd ffs for @xmath93 : @xmath94 also in this case , the behaviour of the off - diagonal ffs is different for quarks and gluons .",
    "let us finally comment on the helicity amplitudes for the partonic hard scattering processes entering eq .",
    "( [ ds - pi - jet ] ) .",
    "again , details have been already presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and we limit here to summarize some useful properties . due to intrinsic partonic motion in the distributions and in the fragmentation process , the general kinematical configuration for the partonic process @xmath20 is not planar in the hadronic c.m .  frame .",
    "since partons can be in general polarized in the process , azimuthal phases are therefore essential and must be properly taken into account .",
    "for massless partons , due to helicity conservation in the quark - gluon vertex and parity invariance only three independent helicity amplitudes survive : @xmath95 here @xmath96 stays for @xmath97 for quarks and @xmath98 for gluons .",
    "@xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) are the three independent helicity amplitudes in the canonical partonic c.m .  frame , that is a frame where partons @xmath28 , @xmath30 move along the @xmath101 direction respectively and the scattering plane coincides with the @xmath102 plane .",
    "the phases @xmath103 collect all azimuthal phases coming from rotations and boosts connecting the canonical partonic c.m .",
    "frame with the hadronic c.m .",
    "frame adopted in the paper .",
    "their general expression is rather involved .",
    "all details and the explicit expressions of the @xmath99 and @xmath103 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we limit ourselves to notice that for parton @xmath19 lying in the @xmath41 plane , as in the present case , the phases @xmath103 are odd under @xmath104 .",
    "this property , as we will see below , is very helpful in selecting physically observable effects out of the many contributions present in eq .",
    "( [ ds - pi - jet ] ) because of the nonplanarity of the partonic process , which however do not survive at the hadronic level under integration over intrinsic parton momenta .",
    "we now concentrate on the partonic kernels entering the expression of the polarized cross section , eq .",
    "( [ ds - pi - jet ] ) : @xmath105    one has to evaluate the kernels for each of the eight distinct partonic channels contributing to the cross section , @xmath106 where in the first line @xmath107 stays for both quarks and antiquarks in all allowed combinations .    in practice , the calculation is performed by summing explicitly over all helicity indexes and inserting the appropriate expressions for the helicity density matrices of partons @xmath28 , @xmath30 and for the polarized distribution and fragmentation functions , as detailed above .",
    "furthermore , after factorizing explicitly all azimuthal dependences , including those coming from the hard - scattering helicity amplitudes , collecting them and using symmetry properties under @xmath108 , one gets the final expression for the kernels , containing only physically allowed terms at the hadronic level .",
    "we will not present explicitly the kernels for all channels .",
    "instead , we limit ourselves to give the kernels for the @xmath109 and @xmath110 channels , which contain the maximal number of terms and give examples of possible contributions involving both quark and gluon distribution and fragmentation functions . moreover , we will directly present the combination of kernels , @xmath111 entering the numerator and the denominator of the single spin azimuthal asymmetries discussed in the sequel .",
    "we will also omit for shortness the explicit dependences on the light - cone momentum fractions and intrinsic momenta of all tmd distribution and fragmentation functions . on the contrary ,",
    "all azimuthal dependences are explicitly shown .",
    "in particular , terms are collected according to the azimuthal dependence in the fragmentation process which directly enter the azimuthal asymmetries we want to study . therefore , we get for the @xmath109 channel : @xmath112^{qq\\to qq } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sim\\big\\{\\,f_{a / a}f_{b / b}\\,[\\,|\\hat{m}^0_1|^2+|\\hat{m}^0_2|^2+|\\hat{m}^0_3|^2\\,]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad -2\\delta^{\\!n}f_{a^\\uparrow / a}\\delta^{\\!n}f_{b^\\uparrow / b } \\hat{m}^0_2\\hat{m}^0_3\\cos(\\varphi_2-\\varphi_3)\\,\\big\\}d_{\\pi / q}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\,\\big\\{\\,\\delta^{\\!n}f_{a^\\uparrow / a}f_{b / b } \\hat{m}^0_1\\hat{m}^0_2\\cos(\\varphi_1-\\varphi_2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad - f_{a / a}\\delta^{\\!n}f_{b^\\uparrow / b } \\hat{m}^0_1\\hat{m}^0_3\\cos(\\varphi_1-\\varphi_3)\\,\\big\\}\\delta^{\\!n}d_{\\pi / q^\\uparrow } \\cos\\phi_\\pi^h\\ , .",

    "could then be a clear indication for a sizable gluon contribution .",
    "however , one must not forget that , as mentioned above , recent phenix results for @xmath200 in the central rapidity region put much more stringent bounds on the gluon sivers distribution than the simple positivity bound adopted in the maximized scenario .",
    "we have checked that even adopting this more stringent bound , a potential gluon - generated sivers asymmetry of the order of 2% might survive in this region , being possibly measurable . in the forward rapidity region , on the contrary , the quark and gluon contributions are comparable at low @xmath179 values , while the maximized asymmetry is dominated by the quark contribution for @xmath201 gev .",
    "therefore , a large sivers asymmetry in this kinematical range could be ascribed unambiguosly to the quark sivers effect .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained at the other c.m .",
    "energies considered or adopting the dss set of fragmentation functions , with some changes in the total size and in the relative weights of the quark and gluon contributions .         in fig .",
    "[ asy - an - siv - par200 ] we show , for both neutral and charged pions , the quark and gluon contributions to the sivers asymmetry , obtained adopting respectively the parametrization sets sidis  1 ( quark contribution : solid red line ; gluon contribution : dashed green line ) and sidis  2 ( quark contribution : dotted blue line ; gluon contribution : dot - dashed cyan line ) , and the updated version of the bound on the gluon sivers asymmetry derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , at @xmath180 gev and in the forward rapidity region , as a function of @xmath179 .",
    "the dotted black vertical line delimits the region beyond which the sidis parameterizations for the quark sivers distribution are extrapolated outside the @xmath202 region covered by sidis data and are therefore plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "this reflects on the fact that below this limit the two sets give comparable results , while above it they differ remarkably .",
    "in particular , at the largest reachable @xmath179 values the sidis  1 set gives a sivers asymmetry of the order @xmath203 , while the sidis  2 set leads to a negligible asymmetry .",
    "therefore , a measurement of this asymmetry might help in clarifying the behaviour of the quark sivers distribution in the large @xmath126 region , which is not covered by present sidis data from hermes and compass experiments .",
    "future planned measurements at the jefferson lab ( jlab ) 12 gev upgrade will also be very useful in this respect ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us first briefly discuss the quark generated asymmetry @xmath206 .",
    "it comes from two distinct contributions , see e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ delta - sig - qq-2 ] ) for the @xmath109 channel : one involving the convolution between the term of the tmd transversity distribution suppressed in the collinear configuration ( @xmath207 ) and the collins function ; another term involving the convolution of the sivers and boer - mulders distributions for the initial quarks with the collins function for the final quark [ an analogous term appears also in the @xmath208 asymmetry , see eq .",
    "( [ delta - sig - qq-2 ] ) ] .",
    "we have explicitly checked that for the process under study and the kinematical configurations considered both these contributions are always negligible already in the maximized scenario .",
    "therefore we will not consider the @xmath209 asymmetry in the sequel .",
    "a similar situation holds also for the gluon generated @xmath210 asymmetry , where two contributions analogous to the quark ones discussed above but for linearly polarized gluons are involved .    in fig .",
    "[ asy - an - coll - max200 ] we present the quark @xmath208 collins asymmetry ( solid red lines ) and the gluon @xmath211 collins - like asymmetry ( dashed green lines ) in the maximized scenario for the @xmath212 process , at @xmath180 gev c.m .",
    "energy in the central ( left panel ) and forward ( right panel ) rapidity region as a function of @xmath179 , from @xmath193 gev up to the maximum allowed value , adopting the kretzer ff set . in the central rapidity region",
    "the quark collins asymmetry is very small at the lowest @xmath179 values , then increases almost linearly reaching about 8% at the upper range . at @xmath213 gev c.m .",
    "energy the behaviour is similar and the largest reached size , at large @xmath179 values , is about half ( twice ) respectively .",
    "results with the dss fragmentation function set are slightly lower in size . instead ,",
    "in the forward rapidity region the asymmetry is ( potentially ) always large and increases almost linearly from about 25% to about 70% going from the lowest to the largest @xmath179 values .",
    "results are very similar at @xmath184 gev and when adopting the dss fragmentation function set .    concerning the gluon collins - like asymmetry , both in the central and in the forward rapidity regions it is of the order of 5% at the lowest @xmath179 values , then starts decreasing slowly and becomes negligible at large @xmath179 values .",
    "very similar results hold at different energies and when adopting the dss set .",
    "let us now consider , for both neutral and charged pions , numerical results for the quark collins asymmetry obtained adopting the parameterizations sidis  1 and sidis  2 for the transversity distribution and the collins fragmentation function ( no parameterizations are available yet in the analogous gluon case ) .",
    "it turns out that in the central rapidity region the estimated asymmetry is practically negligible in all cases considered ( different c.m .",
    "energies and ff sets ) . only for the sidis  2 parametrization and at @xmath145 gev the asymmetry for charged pions can reach about @xmath214% in size at large @xmath179 values .    concerning the forward rapidity region , in fig .  [ asy - an - coll - par200 ] we present , for both charged and neutral pions , some results at @xmath180 gev c.m .",
    "energy as a function of @xmath179 , adopting the sidis  1 ( left panel ) and the sidis  2 ( right panel ) parameterizations .",
    "the collins asymmetry for neutral pions ( dashed green lines ) results to be practically negligible .",
    "this can be easily understood since in the available parameterizations the favoured ( e.g.  @xmath215 ) and unfavoured ( e.g.  @xmath216 ) collins fragmentation functions are comparable in size and opposite in sign . due to isospin symmetry the @xmath176 ffs are half the sum of those for charged pions , therefore the @xmath176 collins ff is always very small .",
    "moreover , the @xmath174 , @xmath175 quark transversity distributions are also opposite in sign , leading to additional cancellations among quark contributions . for charged pions ,",
    "similarly to the case of the sivers asymmetry , the two parameterizations give comparable results ( notice the different scale adopted in the two panels ) in the @xmath179 region where the transversity distribution is reasonably constrained by sidis data ( see the dotted black vertical line ) , while they lead to completely different estimates in the large @xmath179 region where the parameterizations are basically unconstrained by sidis data .",
    "in particular , in this region the sidis  1 set gives almost negligible results , while the sidis  2 set leads to an asymmetry of about 8%  ( @xmath1 ) and 15%  ( @xmath217 ) in size , which should be hopefully measurable .",
    "a measurement of this asymmetry would be then very important and helpful in clarifying the large @xmath126 behaviour of the quark transversity distribution .",
    "a qualitatively similar situation is obtained at @xmath184  gev .          for completeness",
    "we have extended our analysis to the transverse single spin asymmetry for inclusive jet production in polarized @xmath2 collisions , @xmath218 . in principle , this case can be obtained by the jet + pion production process by integrating over the full pion phase space .",
    "of course , in this case the unobserved fragmentation process in the final state plays no role in the azimuthal asymmetries , which can only be originated by mechanisms , like the sivers effect , acting in the initial state .",
    "moreover , we have verified that for the kinematical configurations considered in this paper all contributions but the sivers effect play a negligible role already in the maximized scenario .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we limit our discussion to the sivers asymmetry .",
    "as already mentioned , in this case quark and gluon contributions can not be disentangled since they add up leading to a @xmath119 asymmetry .",
    "let us first discuss the maximized scenario . in the central rapidity region ,",
    "the maximized gluon contribution is of the order 20% at the lowest @xmath179 values , decreasing fast to about 3% at large @xmath179 for all c.m .",
    "energies considered .",
    "the maximized quark contribution is of the order 1 - 3% in the full @xmath179 range , slowly decreasing with the increase of the c.m .",
    "the total potential effect is therefore sizable only at small @xmath179 values due to the gluon component .",
    "the situation is different in the forward rapidity region . here",
    "both quark and gluon maximized contributions can be very sizable , showing as expected an opposite , respectively increasing and decreasing , behaviour vs.  @xmath179 .",
    "the total maximized sivers effect is therefore large in the full @xmath179 range with little dependence on the c.m .",
    "energy .",
    "concerning numerical estimates obtained adopting the available parameterizations sidis  1 and sidis  2 for the quark sivers function , and the updated bound on the gluon sivers function , the situation is the following : + 1 ) in the central rapidity region , for both sidis  1,2 sets and all energies considered the quark contribution is practically negligible .",
    "instead , the gluon contribution can be at most of the order @xmath219% at the lowest @xmath179 values but decreases quickly with the increasing of @xmath179 .",
    "however , at least for @xmath180 and 500 gev , it can still be about 2 - 4% in the upper @xmath179 range .",
    "the measurement of a comparable sivers asymmetry in these kinematical configurations could then be a clear indication for a gluonic contribution to the sivers effect .",
    "+ 2 ) in the forward rapidity region the quark contribution is small and negative at @xmath193 gev for both sets adopted , while at large @xmath179 values it is negligible for the sidis  2 set and positive and of the order 2 - 4% for the sidis  1 set .",
    "the gluon contribution can be sizable at very low @xmath179 values but becomes negligible quickly as @xmath179 increases .",
    "as an example , in fig .",
    "[ asy - siv - jet-200 ] we show the estimated quark and gluon sivers contributions to the transverse single spin asymmetry for inclusive jet production in the central ( left panel ) and forward ( right panel ) rapidity regions at @xmath180 gev , obtained adopting the sidis  1 and sidis  2 parameterizations for the quark sivers function and the updated bound for the gluon sivers function ( assumed to be positive ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the azimuthal asymmetries measurable in the distribution of leading unpolarized or spinless hadrons ( mainly pions ) inside a large-@xmath0 jet produced in unpolarized and single - transverse polarized proton proton collisions for kinematical configurations accessible at rhic . to this end , we have adopted a generalized tmd parton model approach with inclusion of spin and intrinsic parton motion effects both in the distribution and in the fragmentation sectors .",
    "we have shown how a detailed phenomenological analysis of these effects can be very useful in shedding light on several aspects of azimuthal and transverse single spin asymmetries in ( un)polarized hadronic collisions .",
    "it may also help in clarifying the role played by the quark(gluon ) sivers distribution and by the collins(-like ) fragmentation function in the sizable single spin asymmetries observed at rhic for forward pion production .",
    "available parameterizations for the tmd quark transversity and sivers distribution functions , obtained by fitting sidis and @xmath5 data , are presently largely unconstrained for light - cone momentum fractions @xmath220 , that is the region playing a fundamental role for forward pion production at rhic .",
    "the transverse single spin asymmetry for inclusive particle production is a complicate higher - twist effect involving several tmd mechanisms that can not be easily disentangled as in the case of sidis and dy processes . on the contrary ,",
    "the leading - twist azimuthal asymmetries discussed in this paper allow one , in close analogy with the sidis case , to discriminate among different effects by taking suitable moments of the asymmetries .",
    "moreover , we have shown that in principle quark and gluon originating jets can be distinguished , at least in some kinematical regimes .",
    "neglecting intrinsic motion in the distribution sector leaves at work only the collins azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "as already shown by yuan  @xcite , the measurements proposed in this paper would allow one to determine unambiguously the role played by the collins effect .",
    "universality properties of the collins function have been proved , so that this process can be complementary to the sidis and @xmath5 measurements in order to constrain the quark collins fragmentation function and , as an important by - product , the large @xmath126 behaviour of the tmd transversity distribution function .    for the quark and gluon sivers function and for the boer - mulders",
    "function the situation is more complicate . since factorization has not been proven yet for inclusive particle production in hadronic collisions , the use , based on universality , of the parameterizations obtained by fitting sidis and @xmath5data might be questionable .",
    "the phenomenological analysis proposed in this paper gives us the opportunity of testing the factorization and universality assumptions , and of gaining information on the size and _ sign _ of the tmd functions discussed .",
    "this can be very useful also for further developments of the tmd approach , since it is difficult a priori to assess at which values of the factorization scale the role and the size of possible factorization - breaking terms become relevant and non negligible .",
    "let us finally stress again that the unambiguous measurement of any of the asymmetries , other than the collins one , discussed in this paper would be a clear indication of the role played by intrinsic parton motion in the initial colliding hadrons for the spin asymmetry sector in polarized hadronic collisions .",

    "<S> using a generalized parton model approach including spin and intrinsic parton motion effects , and assuming the validity of factorization for large-@xmath0 jet production in hadronic collisions , we study the azimuthal distribution around the jet axis of leading unpolarized or ( pseudo)scalar hadrons , namely pions , produced in the jet fragmentation process . we identify the observable leading - twist azimuthal asymmetries for the unpolarized and single - polarized case related to quark and gluon - originated jets . </S>",
    "<S> we account for all physically allowed combinations of the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distribution and fragmentation functions , with special attention to the sivers , boer - mulders , and transversity quark distributions , and to the collins fragmentation function for quarks ( and to the analogous functions for gluons ) . for each of these effects </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate , at central and forward rapidities and for kinematical configurations accessible at bnl - rhic , the corresponding potentially maximized asymmetry ( for @xmath1 production ) , obtained by saturating natural positivity bounds ( and the soffer bound for transversity ) for the distribution and fragmentation functions involved and summing additively all partonic contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we then estimate , for both neutral and charged pions , the asymmetries involving tmd functions for which parameterizations are available . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the role of the different mechanisms , and the corresponding transverse single spin asymmetries , for large-@xmath0 inclusive jet production . </S>"
