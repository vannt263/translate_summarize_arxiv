    "in the course of hunting the skies for supernovae ( sne ) , modern surveys have revealed a growing sample of transients that peak at significantly fainter luminosities than normal sne and exhibit outflow velocities well below the @xmath810@xmath9kms@xmath10 speeds typically observed . these so - called `` sn impostors '' ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ; smith et al .",
    "2011 ) are generally thought to be extragalactic analogs of the historic nonterminal eruptions of the luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) @xmath7 carinae and p cygni .",
    "some well - known extragalactic examples include sn1954j , sn1997bs , and sn1999bw ( kochanek et al .",
    "the mass loss associated with these nonterminal eruptions can be very substantial , ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( smith & owocki 2006 ) , and it can dramatically punctuate the more persistent loss of h - rich matter driven by relatively steady stellar winds .",
    "the physical processes that trigger and drive the large outbursts remain unexplained , yet are undoubtedly a critical component of the post - main - sequence evolution of massive stars , providing a potential pathway to the wolf - rayet phase ( see smith 2014 for a review ; but also see smith & tombleson 2014 )",
    ".    observations of sn impostors have revealed a broad range of spectral morphologies , peak luminosities , and outburst timescales ( smith et al .",
    "this suggests that there could be multiple physical channels for generating giant outbursts .",
    "possibilities include a massive star exceeding its eddington luminosity ( owocki & shaviv 2012 ) , turbulent energy transport during the late stages of core and shell burning ( smith & arnett 2014 ) , or violent binary interactions ( smith 2011 ) .",
    "diversity in sn impostors could also result from the varying degrees of dense circumstellar matter ( csm ) ejected by the stellar precursor before a major outburst .",
    "interaction between the csm and the relatively fast ensuing outflow can dramatically affect the luminosity , duration , and spectral characteristics of the event , operating much like a scaled - down sniin ( e.g. , smith 2013 ; see filippenko 1997 for a review of sn spectral classification ) .",
    "all of the physical processes mentioned above can presumably operate in massive stars over a broad range of initial masses , which implies that sn impostors could stem from a wide variety of stellar types beyond classical lbvs such as @xmath7 car and p cygni .    to date",
    ", there are only a few direct detections of the stellar precursors to extragalactic sn impostors . by far",
    "the most well - studied example is sn2009ip .",
    "the precursor was a hot and extremely luminous star with @xmath13 and 5080@xmath14 ( smith et al .",
    "2010 ; foley et al .",
    "after a decade of documented variability and multiple lbv outbursts between 2009 and 2011 , the object underwent an unprecedentedly bright and energetic event in 2012 , likely to be a terminal sn explosion ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a , 2014 ; smith , mauerhan , & prieto 2014 ; however , also see pastorello et al .",
    "2013 ; fraser et al . 2013 ; margutti et al .",
    "the stellar parameters of the progenitor of sn2009ip place its effective initial mass well above the upper mass limit for red supergiants , so the object was likely to be a more luminous but also more compact blue supergiant , which is also consistent with the parameters of its purported sn light curve in 2012 ( see smith , mauerhan , & prieto 2014 ) .",
    "the source ugc  2773-ot is another example of a sn impostor with an observed stellar precursor ( smith et al .",
    "2010 ; foley et al .",
    "the star had a luminosity of @xmath15 and estimated initial mass of @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "the observed colour of the star was similar to that of an early a - type supergiant , which is a spectral type observed for some lower - luminosity lbvs .",
    "however , the object also had a dusty circumstellar environment revealed by its infrared excess , so the star could have been hotter and bluer than the source colours suggested at face value .    other examples of sn impostors which have documented observations of pre - outburst variability are sn1954j , sn1961v , sn2000ch , and the peculiar lbv + wolf - rayet binary hd5980 ( smith et al . 2011",
    "; van dyk & matheson 2012 ) . the case of sn1961v , however , remains controversial ; it is unclear whether the object exploded as a true sn ( smith et al .",
    "2011 ; kochanek et al .",
    "sn1997bs is another example , for which there is a single pre - outburst observation of a luminous supergiant star at the position of the event ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "transients with pre - outburst detections of relatively low - mass progenitors that are apparently not consistent with classical lbv phenomena include ngc300-ot ( prieto et al .",
    "2009 ; thompson et al .",
    "2009 ; berger et al . 2009 ) and sn2008s ( prieto et al . 2008 ) , both of which had a luminous mid - infrared counterpart indicative of a heavily dust - enshrouded object , perhaps a super asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) star .",
    "sn2010u and m85-ot are other luminous outbursts that potentially arose from a relatively low - mass stars , although the uncertain influence of extinction associated with these objects has complicated the characterisation of their stellar precursors .    here",
    "we present observations of a new sn impostor , snhunt248 , which experienced a luminous multi - stage outburst beginning may 2014 .",
    "this object is particularly interesting because the precursor star was detected on multiple occasions in space - based archival images with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , and the multi - colour data indicate that the star was in a cool hypergiant phase . snhunt248 thus provides the first direct connection between cool hypergiants and eruptive lbv phenomena , a result which has important implications for the evolution of massive stars .",

    "two integrations of 450s each were obtained at an airmass of 1.05 , with the slit at the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) .",

    "a spectrum was obtained on 2014 june 16 using lcogt s floyds robotic spectrograph ( sand et al .",

    "this observation provided our first epoch of the 2014b event , near peak brightness .",
    "floyds uses a 235linesmm@xmath10 grating and cross - dispersing prism to provide a spectral resolving power ( @xmath26 ) approximately in the range 300 to 700 over a wavelength range of 320010,000 .",

    "the spectra have been extinction corrected assuming @xmath31 ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) . on may 25 , during the 2014a phase , the source exhibits a blackbody temperature of @xmath32  k and is dominated by h@xmath30 p - cygni and numerous transitions of fe  , most of which exhibit p - cygni profiles .",

    "weak [ ca  ii ] emission at @xmath337291 , 7323 and o  i p - cygni ( absorption - dominated ) at 7774   are detected as well , in addition to weak p - cygni features of sc  ii and si  ii , and weak emission from fe  i. near the blue end of the spectrum , strong line blanketing from metals , including ca  ii h&k , suppresses the flux shortward of 5000   .",
    "overall , the 2014a spectrum exhibits the characteristics of a cool , dense outflow , very similar in appearance to the sne  iin - p 1994w and 2011ht during their cooler post - peak phases ( mauerhan et al .",
    "however , the detection of [ ca  ii ] , which normally de - excites back to the ground state in a cool , dense gas such as this , implies the presence of an additional low - density component in the flow .",
    "the line profiles of snhunt248 are shown more clearly in figure  [ fig : spec_ha ] .",
    "on may 25 , h@xmath30 exhibits a line core having a fwhm velocity of @xmath34kms@xmath10 , while the bases of the lines exhibit broad lorentzian wings that extend out to @xmath35kms@xmath10 . on the blue side of the h@xmath30 line ,",
    "the superposition of the extended lorentzian wing and multiple fe  ii transitions might ( at first glance ) give the false appearance of a high - velocity edge to the broad h@xmath30 emission .",
    "the flux minima of the p - cygni absorption components indicate an average outflow velocity of @xmath36kms@xmath10 during 2014a .",
    "the blue edges of the absorption components , particularly na  i  d , extend to @xmath37kms@xmath10 , indicating the presence of faster material .    the spectrum of snhunt248 near the peak of the 2014b phase on june 16 exhibited some substantial changes from the 2014a phase .",
    "balmer emission lines became dominant , while na  i , fe  ii , and the metal line blanketing features at the blue end of the spectrum weakened , giving rise to a stronger blue continuum .",
    "this implies that line blanketing must have also significantly decreased in the uv , which could explain the @xmath38 colour evolution shown in figure  [ fig : color ] .",
    "but the overall slope of the spectrum at wavelengths @xmath39   has not changed significantly from the earlier spectrum on may 25 , and it is consistent with a blackbody temperature of @xmath40  k , only a little hotter than the 2014a phase . the fe  ii lines near 5000   are still evident as p - cygni profiles , though the balmer p - cygni absorption components seen earlier are no longer obvious . but lorentzian wings extending to @xmath41kms@xmath10 remain present in the balmer profiles . at this stage ,",
    "snhunt248 closely resembles the impostor sn1997bs , having a very similar continuum slope and a balmer - dominated emission spectrum .",
    "the 2014b spectrum also shares spectral similarities with sn2009ip during its discovery eruption in 2009 ( smith et al .",
    "2010 ) , but snhunt248 is not quite as blue in the continuum and not as high in ionisation temperature ( e.g. , sn2009ip exhibited substantial emission from he i ) .",
    "the h@xmath30 profile during the 2014b phase also appears similar to that of sn1997bs and sn2009ip , having comparable core fwhm values and similarly broad lorentzian wings .",
    "the velocity implied by snhunt248 s h@xmath30 profile , however , is not nearly as fast as that of sn2009ip during its 2012a event ( i.e. , the onset of sn2009ip s sn explosion ; mauerhan et al .",
    "2013a ) .    by june 26 , the balmer lines increased further in strength relative to the continuum , but this time the fe  ii p - cygni lines near 5000   and na  i have become stronger as well .",
    "narrow emission features of fe  ii blueward of h@xmath30 also become prominent , though without obvious p - cygni profiles . at first glance , the blue edge of the na  i  d line appears to extend to higher velocity at this stage ( @xmath42kms@xmath10 ) than during 2014a , but it is likely that he  i is influencing the line profile ; in fact , the absorption component of the p - cygni line near na  i / he  i appears to have a double trough , whose two minima are separated by @xmath43   , which is consistent with the wavelength separation between na  i and he  i. the h@xmath30 profile on june 26 developed an asymmetric shape with a red shoulder , but does not redevelop a p - cygni absorption component , as the fe  ii transitions do .",
    "our most recent spectrum on june 29 appears very similar to that on june 26 , although the more extended short - wavelength coverage on this date shows that the blue continuum has weakened since june 21 and the effective temperature of the source has become slightly cooler .",
    "if snhunt248 were a bona fide sn explosion , it would be spectroscopically classified as a type iin , based on the presence of namesake `` narrow '' emission lines ( schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1997 ) . however , the collective characteristics of this object , including its comparatively low peak luminosity , its slow outflow velocities , and relatively weak uv continuum , suggest that the 2014 events were substantially less energetic than what we would normally expect from a core - collapse sn .",
    "it thus appears very likely that snhunt248 is a sn impostor  that is , a nonterminal outburst from a massive star in a post - main - sequence phase of its evolution .",
    "indeed , the @xmath44mag variability of the stellar precursor observed from 1997 through 2005 is also consistent with this interpretation , as such behaviour is reminiscent of the s  doradus brightness variations exhibited by lbvs and their kin .",
    "below , we explore the nature of the culprit star and the physical processes that could have led to the recent outbursts .",
    "to estimate the physical parameters of the precursor star of snhunt248 , we used the _ hst _ photometry from the `` quiescent '' epoch on 2005 mar .",
    "10 to place the star on the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram ( correcting for _ galactic _ foreground extinction only , and assuming a single star ) .",
    "the results indicate a stellar luminosity of @xmath45 ( uncertainty dominated by distance ) and an effective temperature of @xmath46k , which corresponds to a blackbody radius of @xmath47  cm ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we estimated this temperature by comparing the reddened @xmath49 colours to castelli & kurucz ( 2003 ) supergiant model atmosphere spectra , using synphot in the iraf / stsdas package .",
    "models of 6750k and 6250k did not produce satisfactory fits , which is how the uncertainty of 300k was estimated .",
    "no combination of the stellar models ( nor pure blackbody curves ) and reddening would simultaneously fit both the @xmath49 and @xmath50 colours , which we suspect is attributable to intrinsic excess emission in the @xmath51 band .",
    "the @xmath51-band data point exhibits an excess of @xmath52mag over our best fit to the @xmath49 colours .",
    "comparison of @xmath53 and @xmath54 for snhunt248 to geneva rotating stellar models ( ekstrm et al .",
    "2012 ) is illustrated in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "the results suggests an initial stellar mass of @xmath55 for the precursor of snhunt248 .",
    "this value uncertainty was estimated by eye from a visual comparison of the position of snhunt248 in figure  [ fig : hr ] with respect to the red termini of the 25m@xmath56 and 32m@xmath56 models .",
    "however , our mass estimate should be taken with caution , as our analysis was performed under the assumption that the extinction - corrected ( galactic only ) colours represent the true colour of the stellar photosphere .",
    "we have not accounted for the possibility of additional reddening from material local to the source . to investigate the variations in extinction in the vicinity of the source",
    ", we examined the colour distribution of neighboring stars in the _ hst _ images , within @xmath57 pc , in projection , of snhunt248 ; however , the results were not very illuminating , as the sample of stars from which to draw this information were few and faint , and exhibited a very large scatter in @xmath49 and @xmath50 colour space . still , there is spectral evidence that the extinction from host - galaxy ism along the line of sight to the source is very low , which we present later .",
    "erstwhile extinction from pre - existing dusty csm that was only present during the precursor phases ( before the recent uv - bright eruptions ) , although purely speculative , is another potential source of error of which we should be cautious , for reasons described below .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr2 ] is a reproduction from smith et al .",
    "( 2004 ; their figure  1 ) showing the distribution of lbvs and related stars in the hr diagram .",
    "the precursor of snhunt248 lies within a region of @xmath53@xmath54 space where the cool hypergiants reside , such as @xmath6 cas , irc  @xmath5810420 , hr  8752 , and var a in m33 .",
    "it is thus plausible that snhunt248 was in a cool hypergiant phase during the decade before its 2014 eruption .",
    "our estimated initial mass is also consistent with this interpretation , as it is very similar to the inferred initial mass of the cool hypergiant @xmath6 cas ( 30@xmath17 ; de jager 1998 ) .",
    "cool hypergiants produce dense , opaque winds ( davidson 1987 ) , and this could explain the colour evolution of the precursor to snhunt248 .",
    "for example , as the source decreased in brightness by @xmath59mag between its relatively bright phase in 2001 and its `` quiescent '' state in 2005 , it exhibited an increasingly red colour , from @xmath60 to 1.2mag .",
    "classical lbvs and supergiants , on the other hand , generally get bluer as they fade , not redder  but in these cases the decreasing brightness is usually associated with the physical contraction of the stellar radius and an increase in the effective temperature .",
    "thus , the reddening of the star as it dimmed could actually be the signature of a dense , opaque wind in the process of formation between 2001 and 2005 .    on a related note",
    ", the condensation of dust in the outer wind or in shells of csm could also have played an important role in the colour evolution .",
    "indeed , dusty csm shells have been observed around cool hypergiants , including @xmath6  cas ( sargent 1961 ) , and are also a common feature of lbvs , such as @xmath7 car , ag car , hr car , p cygni , r 127 , and candidate lbvs ( clbv ) such as hd168625 ( ohara et al .",
    "2003 ) and the large sample of clbvs surrounded by mid - infrared shells detected with the mips instrument aboard the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( wachter et al . 2010 ) . in the case of snhunt248 ,",
    "_ spitzer _ warm mission data at 3.6@xmath61 and 4.5@xmath61 wavelengths were obtained for the host galaxy ngc 5806 , and we have analysed these data to constrain the infrared flux density to @xmath62jy and @xmath63jy , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , at the distance of ngc  5806 , the limits at these wavelengths do not place meaningful constraints on a potential thermal dust source .",
    "for example , at the distance of ngc 5806 , a dusty csm shell similar to that around the lbv hd168625 ( @xmath64jy at 1200pc ; robberto & herbst 1998 ) would exhibit a flux of @xmath65jy in a comparable wavelength domain , four orders of magnitude fainter than our _ spitzer _ limits .",
    "even a very dusty ir - luminous hypergiant such as nml cygni ( schuster et al .",
    "2009 ) , if placed at the distance of ngc5806 , would exhibit fluxes less than 0.1 times our limits .    the amount of extinction from the host ism can be estimated by examining the strength of the narrow nai doublet absorption feature at the redshift of ngc 5806 .",
    "figure[fig : nad ] shows this region of the spectrum from our highest spectral resolution data obtained with keck / deimos on june 26 .",
    "both the galactic and host - galaxy absorption profiles can be seen , but the weakness of these features results in a low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "both components of the doublet are discernible for the galaxy , but only the stronger shorter - wavelength feature of the doublet ( @xmath66 at @xmath67 ) can be distinguished clearly at the redshift of ngc 5806 .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of this feature is @xmath68 for both the galaxy and for ngc  5806 . according to poznanski , prochaska , & bloom ( 2012 )",
    ", this corresponds to a small colour excess of @xmath69mag for each , or @xmath70mag total , corresponding to @xmath71mag , assuming an @xmath31 extinction relation ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "this is consistent with our adopted @xmath72mag for the galaxy , suggesting a comparably small amount of extinction in the host .",
    "therefore , additional absorption from the host ism is not likely to have a significant impact on our photometric analysis , or on interpretation of the precursor star s evolutionary state .",
    "there could , however , have been additional reddening from csm dust back in 2005 that has since been destroyed by uv photons ( e.g. , wesson et al .",
    "2010 ) , either from the recent 2014a event or earlier outbursts between 2005 and 2014 that were not observed .",
    "if so , we would not see the absorbing effect of this dust in the more recent spectra of snhunt248 , and we would thus have no way of accounting for it in our photometric analysis of the stellar precursor .",
    "however , we can consider the potential influence of csm dust by asking what amount of additional reddening , if accounted for , would cause snhunt248 s location in the hr diagram to be moved out of the cool - hypergiant section  that is , moved hotter than 8500k . according to flower ( 1996 ) , the intrinsic colour of a supergiant with , for example , @xmath73k is @xmath74mag .",
    "hypothetically , if snhunt248 were this hot in 2005 and had this same intrinsic colour , then the observed colour of @xmath75mag would imply a total extinction of @xmath76mag , or @xmath77mag , assuming @xmath78 . subtracting the galactic foreground value",
    "would then imply @xmath79mag of unaccounted extinction . in this case",
    ", the inferred luminosity would be a factor of @xmath80 higher , or @xmath81 .",
    "this would place the precursor of snhunt248 near r143 or s dor during their cool states ( see figure  [ fig : hr2 ] ) .",
    "we remind the reader , however , that there is no evidence for this hypothetical amount of additional circumstellar extinction in any of the available data .",
    "we thus move forward in favour of the cool - hypergiant classification for the precursor star in 2005 .        in its quiescent state during 2005 , the stellar precursor s luminosity and estimated initial mass indicate that the electron - scattering eddington ratio at that time was @xmath82 .",
    "note , however , that the actual stellar mass for this eruptive variable star has probably decreased substantially from its initial value , as a result of mass loss via winds and , perhaps , former eruptions over the course of its post - main - sequence life . for a significantly lower mass of , say , @xmath83 ( near the lower mass end for stars that become cool hypergiants with opaque winds ; smith et al .",
    "2004 ) , the eddington ratio would have been @xmath84 , very near the tipping point for the star .",
    "nine years later , at the onset of the 2014a outburst , the increase in luminosity implies that the eddington ratio had already climbed to a value in the range @xmath8512 ( for the same conservative range of stellar masses used above , 1132m@xmath56 ) .",
    "it is thus very plausible that the 2014a eruption resulted from the star crossing over the eddington limit , with which it appears to have been flirting during 19972005 .",
    "a super - eddington wind with @xmath86 can drive strong mass loss on the order of @xmath87yr@xmath10 ( owocki et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the average outflow velocity of 1200kms@xmath88 during the 2014a phase is several times faster than lbv winds and an order of magnitude faster than the winds of cool hypergiants , but is in the observed range for sn impostors ( smith et al .",
    "this velocity , in addition to the range of possible eddington ratios ( @xmath5 to 12 ) , suggests that the 2014a event could have been explosive , as opposed to wind - like .",
    "consistently , the spectral evidence for fast outflowing material having @xmath89kms@xmath10 , as indicated by the blue edges of the p - cygni absorption components , suggests that there could be a fast blast wave of tenuous matter at radii farther out in the flow ; this could be where the [ ca  ii ] emission originates ( see figure  [ fig : spec_wide ] ) .",
    "the rapid onset of the 2014b phase , which followed a rather slow , modest increase in brightness during 2014a , implies that a relatively sudden event took place .",
    "csm interaction is an attractive possibility that could explain both the quick luminosity jump and the subsequent strengthening of the blue continuum and balmer lines in the spectrum near peak on june 16 .",
    "snhunt248 during 2014b could thus be similar to a sn iin , albeit with a much lower energy shock ( e.g. , smith 2013 ) .",
    "indeed , most sne  iin , such as sn2011ht , begin hot and uv bright and _ later _ become cool and dense , with the uv flux declining ahead of the optical .",
    "snhunt248 appears to evolve in the other direction , beginning cool and dense and subsequently peaking late in the uv .",
    "then again , snhunt248 was discovered in an early phase several weeks before the 2014b phase began and climbed to peak brightness .",
    "had we taken our first spectrum nearer to the 2014b peak , there would have been no clear indication of the initial cool , dense phase .",
    "still , the uv evolution relative to the optical , illustrated in figure  [ fig : color ] , would still have appeared noticeably different than a sn iin .",
    "lbv - like stars and cool hypergiants are known to have extended winds and are commonly surrounded by circumstellar nebulae .",
    "csm interaction in the case of snhunt248 would thus be unsurprising if a blast wave was generated by the giant outburst .",
    "if interaction began in 2014b , when the 2014a outflow encountered an outer wind or a csm shell that was moving at a substantially lower velocity , we might have expected to witness a change in the velocities associated with the p - cygni absorption minima ( e.g. , in the fe  ii lines ) , once the shock hit the slower outer wind and illuminated the pre - shock gas .",
    "no such velocity shift was seen in the spectra between may 25 ( 2014a phase ) and june 16 ( peak of 2014b phase ) .",
    "however , in the absence of a strong luminous shock like a typical sn iin , there may have been insufficient flux of uv / x - ray photons to illuminate the outer wind and imprint its emission - line signature on the source s spectrum ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "additionally , if the csm geometry was aspherical and different from that of the impinging outflow , then the spectral features present during 2014a could remain more or less unchanged during the 2014b interaction , aside from dilution by the added continuum from csm - interaction luminosity .",
    "alternatively , the 2014b phase could have begun as material from a second outburst plowed through slower dense material from the 2014a outflow . in this case",
    ", the observational signature of the inner fast component would be obscured by the outer envelope from 2014a , the kinematics of which would determine the morphology of spectral line profiles during both stages .",
    "eventually , if the shock is strong enough , we might expect to see a velocity transition once it overruns the edge of the 2014a outflow and encounters the wind / csm from an earlier phase ( assuming that the 2014a outflow was from a discrete eruption and not a more slowly developing super - eddington wind )",
    ". such a transition might not be detectable , however , if the shock is severely weakened by then , and/or if the outer csm does not have sufficient density to create an observable interaction .    in either of the two csm - interaction scenarios considered above , the majority of the 2014b luminosity is generated by the conversion of kinetic energy into radiation . between the onset of the 2014b phase through july 12 ( the end of the coverage presented here ) , the total radiated energy of the source ( without bolometric correction ) is @xmath90erg .",
    "the efficiency of the conversion of kinetic energy into radiation is not reliably inferable from the available data .",
    "however , if we were to hypothetically assume an efficiency factor of 0.1 , then this would imply a kinetic energy of @xmath91erg for the 2014 eruption .",
    "thus , for an average outflow velocity on the order of 1000kms@xmath10 , the implied ejected mass is on the order of @xmath92 .      the likely conjecture that snhunt248 was in a cool hypergiant phase before undergoing a giant outburst has interesting and important consequences for stellar evolution , for reasons described as follows .",
    "the hr diagram in figure  [ fig : hr2 ] shows the location of the so - called s doradus instability strip , a diagonal stretch of @xmath53@xmath54 space that is populated by lbvs in their hotter states of relative quiescence , near their visual minima . within a particular region on this strip",
    "there is a dearth of lbvs having effective temperatures in the range of 15,000k to 21,000k and luminosities in the range of log  @xmath93 . coincidentally , this is the same range of luminosities exhibited by the cool hypergiants that lie directly to the right ( at cooler temperatures ) of this vacant region of the hr diagram .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2004 ) proposed that the deficit of lbvs in this section of the s doradus instability strip could be the result of the so - called `` bistability jump '' ( lamers et al .",
    "1995 ; vink et al . 1999 ; vink & de koter 2002 ) .",
    "cooler than @xmath94 21,000k ( spectral type b1 ) there is a sudden ionisation - dependent jump in the line - driving parameters within the stellar wind , resulting in an abrupt increase in mass - loss rate and a substantial drop in the terminal velocity of the wind ( @xmath95 ) with respect to the escape speed ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this leads to a catastrophic increase in wind density . as a result ,",
    "an opaque pseudo - photosphere develops in the wind , which presumably can cause lbvs that would otherwise lie on the s doradus instability strip to shift cooler than 8500k in the hr diagram , into the cool hypergiant realm .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested this to be the evolutionary path for @xmath6  cas and the other cool hypergiants mentioned above  i.e. , they _ are _ the missing hot lbvs from the s doradus strip , masquerading as cool supergiants by means of their dense , opaque winds .",
    "if the proposed connection between cool hypergiants and lbv phenomena described above is correct , then we might expect cool hypergiants to be capable of generating violent super - eddington outbursts , like lbvs do .",
    "the 2014 eruption of snhunt248 is thus extremely interesting in this regard , providing the first observational example to solidify this connection .",
    "furthermore , the case of snhunt248 demonstrates not only that cool hypergiants can experience giant outbursts , but that they can rival in peak luminosity the giant eruptions from stellar behemoths like @xmath7 car , even though they stem from stars of relatively low initial mass . this achievement could have been made possible by the boost in luminosity provided by csm interaction .",
    "the case of snhunt248 provides a valuable new addition to the small sample of sn impostors for which we have information on the precursor . the 2014 eruption appears to have been the result of a super - eddington outburst which experienced a subsequent phase of csm interaction that resulted in a large boost in luminosity .",
    "snhunt248 provides the first observational connection between cool hypergiant stars and explosive lbv phenomena , lending credence to the hypothesis that cool hypergiants are the missing lbvs from the s  doradus strip , hidden behind cool , dense , opaque envelopes ( smith et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the looming fact remains that there is still no satisfactory explanation for what drives massive stars to generate super - eddington outbursts or other explosive processes that produce luminous transient events .",
    "multiple possibilities have been outlined by smith et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and smith & arnett ( 2014 ) , some of which might be applicable to snhunt248 .",
    "these include runaway stellar pulsations , geyser - like eruptions caused by large opacity variations during post - main - sequence evolution , turbulent and explosive nuclear shell - burning , the pair - instability mechanism ( probably only important for extremely massive stars ) , electron - capture sne ( probably important only for 8@xmath97 stars ) , or failed sne .",
    "close stellar encounters in binary systems are another potential pathway for giant outbursts ( e.g. , see smith 2011 ) .",
    "this is an interesting possibility in the case of snhunt248 , as nonconservative mass transfer in a massive binary could have led to the formation of the extended cool hypergiant envelope ( e.g. , see chesneau et al",
    ". 2014 ) , preceding the recent eruption .    a more complete sample of sn impostors and higher",
    "cadence photometry and spectroscopy during multiple phases of their evolution will help elucidate the nature of these outbursts .",
    "the near - future development of deep high - cadence sky surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope will undoubtedly lead to a significant improvement in our understanding of these objects .",
    "in addition , a more thorough investigation of massive stars in the galaxy having resolved circumstellar nebulae that resulted from giant outbursts will help connect the observables of extragalactic transients to the physical properties and energetics of the outflows they produce . once accompanied by a firmer theoretical foundation regarding the late stages of stellar evolution",
    ", the myriad of potential physical processes involved in generating sn impostors and other luminous transients may begin to be narrowed down with some confidence .",
