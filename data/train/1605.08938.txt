    "the strong goldbach s conjecture refers to christian goldbach s theory which was represented by him with a letter to the great swiss mathematician leonard euler in 1742 .",
    "he asked him for solving this problem .",
    "he spent much time trying to prove it , but never succeeded . in this theory , he claims that `` every even integer greater than two could be a sum of two prime numbers '' . the word `` strong '' is opposition to word `` weak '' where refers to `` every odd number greater than five could be a sum of three prime numbers '' . since two hundreds years ago , several relevant proofs on this subject have been conducted . using the sieve method ,",
    "a lot of mathematicians as brun [ 1 ] in 1920 have verified various results who expressed  every even integer is a sum of product at most 9 primes and product at most another 9 primes `` . wang [ 2 ] expressed in 1962 , ' ' every even integer is a sum of 1 prime and product at most 4 primes \" .",
    "pan [ 3 ] obtained in 1962 that every even integer is a sum of 1 prime and product at most 5 primes .",
    "richert [ 4 ] obtained same result in 1969 , but product at most 3 primes instead at most 5 primes .",
    "chen [ 5]in 1973 proved same for 1 prime and product at most 2 primes . renyi [ 6 ] in 1947 represented that every even integer is a sum of 1 prime and product at most c primes .",
    "montgomery and vaughan found an exceptional set in goldbach s problem by the circle method [ 7 ] .",
    "we presented [ 8 - 9 ] by the two papers in 2009 and 2010 stating 5 new functions,11 new lemmas , a novel explicit formula for computing @xmath0 , several methods , a new conjecture and some new experimental computations to prove goldbachs conjecture experimentaly .",
    "c.d . pan and c.b .",
    "pan in [ 10 ] made the proof of some theorems in analytic number theory so that we make use of some of them here .",
    "most of these theorems are about the proof of the prime number theorem .",
