    "it has long been known that the nonlinear frequency shifts @xmath0 of collisionless plasma waves can depend on the wave amplitude @xmath1 in various ways , even at small @xmath1 .",
    "the contributions to @xmath2 that stem from fluid effects typically scale as @xmath3 @xcite , whereas kinetic effects can produce contributions scaling as @xmath4 @xcite or even decreasing with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the interest to such nonlinear dispersion relations ( ndrs ) has been revived recently in connection with laser - plasma interactions @xcite and the evolution of energetic - particle modes in tokamaks @xcite .",
    "however , each of the existing theories that offers an explicit formula for @xmath0 describes just one type of nonlinearity .",
    "the possible effect of multiple coexisting nonlinearities that yield different scalings in @xmath1 was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , but only heuristically and for an artificial plasma model .",
    "the more general existing theories , such as that of bernstein - greene - kruskal ( bgk ) waves @xcite , rely on formal solutions of the vlasov - maxwell equations and are not always easy to apply in practice due to their complexity .",
    "but is it possible to derive a comprehensive and yet tractable asymptotic ndr for general collisionless plasma ?",
    "the answer is yes , and here we show how to do it explicitly .",
    "we build on the theory that was developed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite and represents a fully nonlinear kinetic version of whitham s average - lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "( we assume that , when present , resonant particles are phase - mixed , so the corresponding waves are of the bgk type @xcite . )",
    "this allows deriving the ndr directly from the wave lagrangian , which is known , without solving any differential equations .",
    "in fact , all wave properties can be traced to the properties of a single function characterizing individual particles , namely , the normalized action @xmath5 of a particle as a function of its normalized energy @xmath6 .",
    "we focus on langmuir waves in one - dimensional electron plasma , but extending the theory to general waves is straightforward to do .    unlike in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a related theory was constructed under the sinusoidal - wave approximation , we now allow for a nonzero amplitude of the second harmonic ( higher - order harmonics are assumed negligible ) and find this amplitude self - consistently .",
    "kinetic and fluid nonlinearities are hence treated on the same footing , and two types of distributions are studied in detail : ( i ) first , we consider particle distributions , @xmath7 , that are smooth enough near the resonance .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is small in this case ; then kinetic nonlinearities scale as half - integer powers of @xmath1 , and fluid nonlinearities scale as integer powers of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it is shown for the first time that the fluid nonlinearity can be expressed in terms of the plasma dielectric function and , contrary to the common presumption , can have either sign .",
    "( ii ) next , we consider the effect of abrupt trapped - particle beam distributions superimposed on smooth @xmath7 .",
    "the small parameter in this case is not @xmath1 but rather the appropriately normalized trapped - particle density .",
    "we show that such beams contribute additively to the ndr .",
    "we revisit the case of flat - top trapped beams @xcite , as an illustration , and demonstrate that our asymptotic theory yields predictions for both the wave frequency and the second - harmonic amplitude that are virtually indistinguishable from those given by the exact solution of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "our theory then can be considered as advantageous over such solutions .",
    "this is because , while offering a reasonable precision , it is more transparent and flexible , i.e.,can be used also when exact analytical formulas do not exist .",
    "nonlinearities with both smooth particle distribution ( including fluid and kinetic effects ) and distributions with abrupt changes near the resonant region ( beam distribution ) are treated on the same footing . in particular ,",
    "we show , for the first time , that the fluid nonlinearity can be expressed in terms of the plasma dielectric function and , contrary to the common presumption , can have either sign",

    "otherwise , one can always choose @xmath25 such that , locally , its velocity relative to the true laboratory frame be zero , even though the relative acceleration may be nonzero .",
    "also keep in mind that the laboratory frame of reference is not necessarily the plasma rest frame .",
    "the oc hamiltonians of passing particles ( denoted with index @xmath35 ) and trapped particles ( denoted with index @xmath36 ) , which enter eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , can be expressed as follows : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the wave phase velocity ( we use the symbol @xmath39 for definitions ) , @xmath40 is the local frequency , @xmath41 is the local wave number , and @xmath42 is the wave phase . also , @xmath43 is the oc canonical momentum of a passing particle in the laboratory frame @xmath25 , @xmath44 is the particle total energy in the frame @xmath45 that moves with respect to @xmath25 at velocity @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the particle velocity in @xmath45 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the electron mass and charge .",

    "( [ eq : hpht ] ) , one can cast eq .",

    "yet @xmath71 is also advantageous in the sense that it is _ easier _ to calculate or model in many cases of interest , especially those that are of interest to approach analytically .",
    "this is because @xmath59 is _ the _ natural variable for phase - mixed distributions .",
    "for example , @xmath59 is an adiabatic invariant for trapped particles , and passing particles often conserve @xmath43 or @xmath50 , which are expressible through @xmath59 .",
    "models of the distribution functions in such variables are therefore particularly robust .",
    "hence , the problem of modeling @xmath71 often can be decoupled from the problem of finding the ndr . in other words , it can be meaningful to search for @xmath77 for a given @xmath71 .",
    "( the situation is similar to calculating linear dispersion for a given `` unperturbed '' velocity distribution ( * ? ? ? * chap .  8) , but nonlinear calculations involving velocity distributions usually do not enjoy this property . ) apart from the examples considered in this paper , see also refs .",

    "we postpone considering beam distributions until sec .",
    "[ sec : trapped ] , whereas the bulk plasma will be modeled as follows .",
    "let us assume that a wave is excited by a driver with homogeneous amplitude , so the oc canonical momenta @xmath43 are conserved and equal the initial momenta , @xmath78 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) , one gets @xmath79 so the action distribution is given by @xmath80,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the initial velocity distribution .",
    "this is also known as the adiabatic - excitation model @xcite .      before we proceed to a general calculation ,",
    "notice the following .",
    "the conservation of @xmath43 implies that , as a result of the wave excitation , the plasma generally changes its average velocity , @xmath81 , by some @xmath82 .",
    "this leads to a nonlinear doppler shift , @xmath83 , by which the frequency @xmath77 in the laboratory frame @xmath25 differs from that in the plasma rest frame @xcite .",
    "the shift can be calculated using that @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is considered as a function of @xmath59 and of the wave parameters @xcite .",
    "however , the concept of the plasma rest frame is meaningful mainly when the resonant population is negligible , in which case the following simple derivation is possible .",
    "( also see appendix  [ app : hydro ] for an alternative derivation under the same condition . )    by combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : pphi ] ) with eq .  ( [ eq : pmv0 ] ) , one gets for an initially - resting plasma that @xmath87 one can also reexpress the right hand side as follows : @xmath88 f_0(v_0)\\ , dv_0 \\notag \\\\ & \\approx -\\frac{e^2 k \\phi_1",

    "hence , one eventually arrives at the following expression for the nonlinear doppler shift : @xmath92 where we introduced @xmath93 .",
    "also notably , the momentum density associated with the nonlinear doppler shift is @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the wave amplitude , and @xmath96 is the wave energy density ( * ? ? ?",
    "one may recognize @xmath97 as the canonical @xcite momentum density of a linear wave ( * ? ? ?",
    "it is seen then that the nonlinear doppler shift is precisely the effect that allows a linear electrostatic wave carry momentum .",
    "( the additional acceleration caused by a lf field , if any , changes the momentum of the oc motion rather than the wave momentum . )",
    "some calculations reported in literature ignore the nonlinear doppler shift and present the ndr as a relation between @xmath2 and @xmath98 in the plasma rest frame @xcite . keep in mind , however , that this frame is by default unknown .",
    "hence , calculating @xmath0 in the plasma rest frame generally says nothing about the frequency shift that could be directly measured in laboratory .",
    "( defining the wave momentum is also problematic in this case . )",
    "although it is in principle possible to excite a wave without accelerating plasma , such scenarios are not typical for traveling waves that we consider @xcite . of course , there are geometries where the average flow is bound to vanish eventually , e.g.,to prevent the growth of the lf field ( appendix  [ app : e ] ) .",
    "but this effect is not universal and , in any case , is restricted to stationary waves .",
    "in contrast , our lagrangian formulation allows calculating a more fundamental , _ local _ ndr , since @xmath22 is treated as an independent function . as a result ,",
    "our theory automatically accounts for plasma acceleration associated with the wave excitation in the frame @xmath25 for a given particle distribution .",
    "( as we explained in sec .",

    "_ already includes _ the nonlinear doppler shift , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndop ] ) will be used only to establish connections between our results and other theories .",
    "it is to be noted that integration by parts in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eps0 ] ) is justified only by the assumption of having no resonant particles , in which case the integrand is analytic .",
    "more generally , we will define @xmath99 as the following real function , @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the cauchy principal value .",

    "since large amplitudes typically result in rapid deterioration of waves through various nonlinear instabilities , the very concept of the ndr is of interest mainly for waves with small enough amplitudes , i.e.,when the wave shape is close to sinusoidal .",
