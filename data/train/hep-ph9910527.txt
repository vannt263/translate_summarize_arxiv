    "recently the problem of the definition of @xmath0 boson mass and width has been discussed @xcite .",
    "the problem refers to the definition of the physical parameters of unstable particle .",
    "the @xmath0 boson s _ in _ and _ out _ states can not be considered as the eigenvectors of the energy - momentum operator ( clearly this is true for any unstable system ) .",
    "thus we have no unambiguous theoretical prescription for the definition of @xmath0 boson mass .",
    "the conventional way is to extract the mass and the width from the amplitudes of processes containing the corresponding resonance in the @xmath5-channel .",
    "e.g. the amplitude of the process @xmath6 near its peak position is often parameterized as @xcite : @xmath7 or @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the residue , the remainder , less singular part of the amplitude is designated by @xmath10 and it is assumed that the first term numerically exceeds @xmath11 .",
    "the parameterization ( 1)-(2 ) may be obtained from the conditions on the green function of @xmath0 boson field .",
    "these conditions define the renormalization scheme , and as a consequence , the resonance parameters .    in consideration of the mass and width two schemes",
    "are prevalent .    in the framework of the first scheme the resonance parameters are defined as @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is the position of the pole of propagator in a a complex @xmath5-plane @xcite : @xmath15 in ( 2 ) @xmath16 is the denominator of the exact propagator of the @xmath0 boson .    in the another , so called on mass - shell scheme , the variable @xmath5 remains real and the definition is following @xcite : @xmath17    of course , many different schemes can be introduced .",
    "e.g. the mass can be defined as the peak position of the amplitude , but in this case it would depend on the process under consideration . from the theoretical point of view",
    "it is preferable that the mass of an unstable particle , in a full analogy with the case of stable one , is defined without referring to any particular element of the @xmath5 matrix but the propagator .",
    "the condition imposed on the propagator of an unstable particle is a realization of the scheme defining mass and width .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the gauge dependence of the resonance parameters , defined in schemes ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "note , that the gauge independence of the physical mass and width is the separate requirement , not being the direct consequence of the gauge independence of amplitude ( 1)-(2 ) .",
    "in other words , from the requirement of gauge independence of observables ( in our case - @xmath0 line shape ) it does not follow necessarily that the resonance parameters should be gauge invariant . in discussing the gauge dependence",
    "one expects that since the pole of the amplitude is a physical quantity , the mass and the width , defined through scheme ( 3 ) are gauge independent , while it is not evident in case of scheme ( 4 ) .",
    "below we check this argument in the framework of perturbation theory .    in section",
    "* 2 * we demonstrate that @xmath18 and @xmath19 , defined in scheme ( 3 ) , are gauge independent in the two - loop approximation while the scheme ( 4 ) leads to the gauge dependence of these parameters ( from @xcite we have learned that a. sirlin has arrived to the same conclusion about the scheme ( 4 ) . unfortunately at the present time the publication @xcite is not available to us and hence we are not able to compare our arguments ) .    in section * 3 * it is argued that if we use the scheme ( 4 ) or any other scheme with the gauge dependent @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the scattering amplitude is still gauge independent .",
    "we use the bare lagrangian in which the higgs field condensate @xmath20 and the @xmath21 mixing are chosen in the tree approximation @xcite .",
    "the input parameters are the bare electromagnetic charge @xmath22 and the bare masses @xmath23 .",
    "calculations are performed in @xmath24 gauge in the framework of dimensional regularization .",
    "we use feynmann rules from the review @xcite .",
    "to investigate the gauge dependence of @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined in the scheme ( 3 ) let us express @xmath25 as follows : @xmath26 where the complex numbers @xmath27 do not depend on @xmath22 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the contributions from terms with the gauge parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are factorized in the expression for @xmath31 .",
    "the most time - taking part of calculations in @xmath24 gauge is that with the gauge parameter @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the two - loop approximation where there is no factorization we will investigate only the sector with @xmath28 to which we refer throughout this paper as @xmath32 .",
    "this parameter appears in the free propagators of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( for the denotions see @xcite ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 correspond to the pseudogoldstone and ghost degrees of freedom appearing in @xmath24 gauge ) : @xmath36 and @xmath37 for brevity we will term the denominators with @xmath38 as @xmath38-terms .",
    "one loop correction to the @xmath0 boson self energy contains terms , linear in @xmath38 ( i.e. integrand contains only one @xmath38-denominator ) as well as @xmath39-terms ( the product of two @xmath38-denominators ) .",
    "two loop correction contains @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 terms .",
    "the simple calculation based on ward identities demonstrates that @xmath40 , @xmath41 terms cancel trivially , and the technique is exactly the same as in the case of stable particles .",
    "further we will discuss only @xmath38 and @xmath39-terms which are present in one - loop and two - loop corrections and interfere with each other .",

    "even now two - loop calculations are still tedious .",
    "to proceed further let us note that in the sense of the gauge dependence the crucial difference between the results following from the schemes ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is caused by fermion loops , leading to @xmath45 . since our goal is to establish the ( possible ) gauge dependence of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in the gauge independent part of @xmath31 we retain the contribution from the lepton sector only .",

    "summarizing , we consider only @xmath38 and @xmath39 terms from the `` @xmath38-sector '' and in the expression for @xmath31 only the contributions from the electron and neutrino loops are taken into account .",
    "after these introductory remarks we are in a position to discuss the gauge dependence of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "let us consider first the one - loop contribution to @xmath46 - self energy of the @xmath0 boson . to extract parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "it is enough to consider the coefficient of @xmath47 .",

    "the @xmath38-terms is canceled in the sum of the expressions ( 16 ) and ( 24 ) , and it turns out that @xmath93 is gauge invariant in order of @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sum of the real parts of ( 18 ) and ( 23 ) still depends on @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the scheme ( 3 ) , in distinct with ( 4 ) , defines the gauge independent parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the cancelation of the gauge dependent terms occurs in a full analogy with the case of @xmath24 gauge .",
    "a few words about @xmath21 mixing : when we define the mixing scheme by the requirement that green s function @xmath95 has no poles ( i.e. the mass - shell for the photon is defined only from @xmath96 and @xmath14 is defined only from @xmath97 ) , there arise a new effective vertices but @xmath14 does not change .",
    "note that the same value of this parameter is obtained as a position of pole of the green s functions @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the original gauge fields of the gauge groups @xmath103 and @xmath104 leading after mixing to @xmath105 and @xmath0 .    note also that if we take into account the quantum corrections in the definition of the higgs condensate in the bare lagrangian , i.e. @xmath106 , then @xmath107 , but the parameter @xmath14 would be the same .",
    "moreover , the replacement @xmath108 does not affect the green s function which does not contain the higgs field @xmath44 on external lines .",
    "as we have demonstrated in section * 2 * , the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined in scheme ( 3 ) do not depend on the gauge parameter in the two - loop approximation .",
    "since the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined in the scheme ( 4 ) are gauge dependent , it might seem that the scheme ( 3 ) is preferable .",
    "below we show that the requirement of the gauge independence as well as the requirement of numerical convergence does not lead in principle to the preference of one particular scheme .",
    "let us express @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the framework of regularized theory ( i.e. @xmath109 ) as follows : @xmath110 it is possible to resolve @xmath111 and @xmath112 in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath113 and @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the mass and width renormalization factors .",
    "clearly , the coefficients in expressions ( 25 ) - ( 27 ) are gauge independent when calculated in the scheme ( 3 ) and depend on a gauge in the case of scheme ( 4 ) .",
    "if we substitute ( 26)-(27 ) in the expression for the physical quantity , e.g. the amplitude @xmath117 we obtain the ultraviolet finite result which may be parameterized as ( 1)-(2 ) , or as follows : @xmath118 the gauge independence of @xmath119 in a scheme ( 3 ) is evident since the coefficients @xmath120 do not depend on gauge parameters . in scheme ( 4 )",
    "the coefficients @xmath120 contain @xmath38 explicitly but this does not lead to the gauge dependence of amplitude @xmath119 . indeed , for this case , in the expression @xmath121 every term is non vanishing but in the sum they cancel since the scheme ( 4 ) is connected with the scheme ( 3 ) via the renormalization group equations with respect to the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "these equations can be obtained from ( 26)-(27 ) : @xmath122 where @xmath123 the similar equations for the other masses @xmath124 can be easily obtained .",
    "it is evident that if we consider the scheme where @xmath125 , the independence of physical quantities on @xmath38 appears in a full analogy with the independence on a renormalization point .",
    "if we use ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) , we would obtain from ( 28 ) that @xmath126\\ ] ] in each order of @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , the same relations hold for the remaining gauge parameters .",
    "relation similar to ( 32 ) with respect to renormalization point @xmath127 states that ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a physical quantity calculated up to order @xmath130-th order in renormalized coupling @xmath131 . in any particular order of perturbation theory",
    "the response of a physical quantity on @xmath132 is of a _ next order _ in @xmath131 .",
    "evidently , the exact expression is the renormalization point ( and gauge parameter ) independent .",
    "so , the requirement of the gauge independence of the amplitude @xmath117 is not sufficient to prefer scheme ( 3 ) .",
    "let us consider the problem of numerical analysis .",
    "the peak position of the amplitude , @xmath133 , is defined as the solution of the equation : @xmath134 it is easy to show that in a scheme ( 3 ) we obtain @xmath135 while the scheme ( 4 ) leads to @xmath136 evidently , if the series ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) converge fast enough , the scheme ( 3 ) is preferable when @xmath137 .",
    "but from the theoretical point of view this is rather troublesome to confirm .",
    "indeed , the coefficient functions @xmath138 and @xmath139 depend on the masses of all the particles of the standard model , so their values can not be estimated with the help of the current data .",
    "note that there exists other scheme which leads to the same results in a two - loop approximation as the scheme ( 3 ) .",
    "for example one can define a new scheme by the relation : @xmath140 the simple calculation shows that @xmath18 , defined by ( 37 ) differs from the result of scheme ( 3 ) only in order @xmath141 . in other words , in a two - loop approximation the scheme ( 37 ) leads to the gauge independent @xmath18 and this @xmath18 satisfies relation , similar to ( 3 ) .",
    "the results following from these two schemes differ only in three - loop approximation .",
    "in this paper , based on the gauge independence and numerical analysis we have investigated the schemes defining the mass and the width of @xmath0 boson .",
    "the relations ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) demonstrate that the schemes ( 3 ) and ( 37 ) may be preferable . on the other hand , since in a scheme ( 4 ) the arbitrary parameter @xmath38 remains , the problem of convergence in ( 36 ) requires the consideration of the renormalization group equations ( 30 ) .",
    "it may occur that for some numerical values of @xmath38 the series ( 36 ) would converge faster than the series ( 35 ) .",
    "it is not surprising since from ( 29)-(30 ) it is evident that the gauge parameter @xmath32 plays the role , analogous of renormalization point and thus , in principle , the variation of @xmath32 can improve the convergence of series in @xmath142 .",
    "hence , the requirement of the numerical convergence can not be used in defining the physical mass and the width of the @xmath0 boson , since this requirement may be in contradiction with requirement of gauge invariance of these parameters .",
    "note also that the result of numerical analysis depends essentially on the process under consideration .    from the requirement of gauge independence",
    "the schemes ( 3 ) and ( 37 ) are preferable .",
    "unfortunately , this principle is necessary but not sufficient and therefore does not leads to the unique choice of a scheme . indeed , besides ( 3 ) and ( 37 ) , infinitely many schemes for defining the gauge independent parameters can be pointed out . for example",
    "let us express the @xmath0 boson propagator as @xmath143 where @xmath144 stands for the contribution of physical degrees of freedom ( i.e. @xmath144 is gauge independent ) and @xmath145 varies from gauge to gauge .",
    "consider now any conditions on real and imaginary parts of @xmath144 , leading to the ultraviolet renormalization .",
    "it is evident that these conditions define two gauge invariant parameters which may be treated as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    despite of this non uniqueness ,",
    "the schemes ( 3 ) and ( 37 ) are remarkable .",
    "indeed , @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined in scheme ( 3 ) are connected with the position of the pole of propagator on the complex plane and in scheme ( 37 ) they can be obtained from the position of the peak of amplitude on real axis . apparently it is the scheme ( 3 ) that defines the physical mass and the width of @xmath0 boson , since , from our point of view , only this scheme allows us to formulate the lehmann - symanzik - zimmermann ( lsz ) reduction technique @xcite for the processes involving @xmath0 boson in initial or final states .",
    "some papers contain attempts to generalize lsz technique for unstable particles ( see e.g @xcite ) but we think that more thoroughful analysis is necessary .",
    "our recent calculations show that the residue of the amplitude @xmath117 in a two - loop approximation is gauge independent at @xmath146 .",
    "this fact already indicates the incontrovertible preference of scheme ( 3 ) since the gauge independence of the residue apparently leads to the gauge independent amplitude for the decay @xmath147 .",
