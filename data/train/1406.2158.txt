    "the classical approach combining finite element ( fem ) with boundary element methods ( bem ) for solving exterior boundary value problems in continuum mechanics , usually known as the coupling of fem and bem , has been extensively employed since its creation during the second half of the seventies up to nowadays .",
    "the usual procedure is as follows .",
    "the underlying domain is first divided into two subregions by introducing an auxiliary boundary @xmath0 , if necessary , so that the original exterior problem can be reformulated as a transmission problem through @xmath0 .",
    "next , the latter is reduced to an equivalent problem in the bounded inner region by imposing nonlocal boundary conditions on @xmath0 that are derived by employing boundary integral equation methods in the unbounded outer domain .",
    "the resulting nonlocal boundary value problem is then solved by a conventional galerkin method , in which the boundary integral operators involved are discretized using finite element spaces on @xmath0 .    while detailed surveys on most of the different ways of coupling bem and fem can be seen in @xcite and (",
    "* chapter i ) , we simply recall here that the most popular ones correspond to the _ johnson & ndlec _ ( j & n ) and _ costabel & han _ ( c & h ) procedures ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , which employ the green representation of the solution in the unbounded region .",
    "the success of the j & n method , being based on a single boundary integral equation on @xmath0 and the fredholm theory , hinged on the fact that certain boundary integral operators are compact , which usually requires @xmath0 to be smooth enough . according to it ,",
    "it was not possible , at least from a theoretical point of view , to employ this approach when the coupling boundary was non  smooth , say for instance polygonal , which left out the possibility of utilizing classical finite element discretizations",
    ". moreover , the j & n idea seemed to be applicable only to the laplace operator since for other elliptic systems , such as the elasticity one , and irrespective of the smoothness of the boundaries , the aforementioned compactness did not hold .",
    "one attempt to overcome this was suggested in @xcite where the underlying transmission problem was replaced by one employing the pseudostress instead of the usual stress . as a consequence",
    ", the foregoing mapping property was achieved , but the coupling boundary was still required to be smooth enough .",
    "one has to admit , however , that the above described drawbacks were mainly theoretical since no failure of the corresponding discrete schemes was ever reported by users of the method in problems where those hypotheses were not met . any way , in order to circumvent these apparent difficulties , suitable modifications of the original j & n method , in which neither the compactness nor the smoothness play any role , were proposed by _",
    "costabel _ and _ han _ in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "both techniques are based on the addition of a boundary integral equation for the normal derivative ( resp .",
    "traction in the case of elasticity ) .",
    "the former leads to a symmetric and non - positive definite scheme , while the latter , on the contrary , yields a positive definite and non - symmetric scheme . nevertheless , and since the only difference between these formulations lies on the sign of an integral identity , from now on we simply refer to either one of them as the c & h approach .",
    "further and later contributions in this direction , including applications to nonlinear problems and coupling with mixed - fem , non  conforming fem , local discontinuous galerkin , and hybridizable discontinuous galerkin methods , can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .    the whole picture on the coupling of fem and bem , and particularly the widely accepted fact since the eighties concerning the lack of further applicability and usefulness of the j & n method , changed dramatically with @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it was proved in this paper , without any need of applying fredholm theory nor assuming smooth domains , that all galerkin methods for this approach are actually stable , thus allowing the coupling boundary @xmath0 to be polygonal / polyhedral . as a consequence , the classical j & n",
    "method was begun to be considered as a real competitor of the c & h approach . in other words ,",
    "the appearing of @xcite gave rise to several new contributions within this and related topics .",
    "indeed , we first refer to @xcite where the corresponding extension to the combination of mixed - fem and bem on any lipschitz - continuous interface @xmath0 was successfully developed .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the quasi ",
    "symmetric procedure from @xcite was improved in @xcite by showing that the interface @xmath0 can also be taken polygonal / polyhedral , and that in the case of the elasticity problem , the coupling can be performed by employing the usual stress instead of the pseudostress . in addition , a new and extremely simplified proof of the main result in @xcite , by showing directly ellipticity of the operator equation , was provided in @xcite .",
    "an alternative proof of this ellipticity result has been recently given in @xcite , using a particular expression of the steklov ",
    "poincar operator , which is based on a schur complement of a perturbation of the caldern projector .",
    "some comments on the consequences of the new theory of non - symmetric coupling of bem and fem can be found in the republishing of @xcite as @xcite . nevertheless , the utilization of mixed - fem instead of the usual fem , and the application of the j & n coupling procedure to the 3d stokes and similar elliptic systems such as lam , is still missing .",
    "moreover , most of the related works available in the literature involve either 2d problems or just the coupling of bem and the usual fem ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the analysis of the c & h approach for the coupling of mixed - fem and bem has not yielded too satisfactory results when it has been applied to the elasticity problem ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    according to the above bibliographic discussion , and specially motivated by the recent results from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we now aim to analyze the coupling of mixed - fem and bem , as applied to the 3d exterior stokes problem , by utilizing both the j & n and the c & h approaches .",
    "more precisely , we extend the first method to the present case , without assuming any smoothness requirement on the interface , but only lipschitz - continuity . furthermore , and differently from the analysis in @xcite for the elasticity problem , we are also able to extend the second coupling procedure to the 3d stokes problem by providing a direct proof of the required coerciveness property , that is without argueing by contradiction , and by using the natural norm of each space instead of mesh - dependent norms .",
    "our results here can be easily extended to the 2d and 3d lam systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we introduce the exterior boundary value problem of interest by describing it as the transmission problem between the non - homogeneous stokes equation ( holding in a bounded annular domain @xmath1 ) and the homogeneous stokes equation ( holding in an unbounded exterior region @xmath2 ) .",
    "the incompressibility condition is employed here to eliminate the pressure so that the stress tensor and the velocity vector become the main unknowns of the resulting transformed problem .",
    "the dual - mixed formulations in @xmath1 for different boundary conditions on the interior boundary of this region are derived in section [ section3 ] .",
    "then , in section [ section4 ] we recall the main aspects and properties of the boundary integral equation approach as applied to the homogeneous stokes equation in @xmath2 .",
    "next , in section [ section5 ] we derive and analyze the coupled variational formulations that arise from the combination of the dual - mixed approach in @xmath1 with the boundary integral equation method in @xmath2 .",
    "we first identify the solutions of the associated homogeneous problems and then establish the well - posedness of the continuous formulations . in particular , the classical johnson & nedelec procedure , which employs a single boundary integral equation and yields a non - symmetric scheme , is extended to the present case by requiring only a lipschitz - continuous coupling boundary .",
    "in addition , the costabel & han approach , which makes use of two bounday integral equations and leads to a symmetric formulation , is also successfully analyzed with the natural norms of the spaces involved and through direct proofs of the required continuous and discrete coeciveness properties .",
    "finally , in section [ section6 ] we consider the galerkin schemes arising from the coupled formulations studied in section [ section5 ] , and provide explicit hypotheses to be satisfied by the respective discrete spaces in order to guarantee their corresponding solvability and stability .",
    "moreover , concrete examples of finite element and boundary element subspaces verifying those conditions are also identified here .",
    "we end this section with some notations to be used below . given any hilbert space @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , the space of vectors and square matrices of order @xmath6 with entries in @xmath3 . in particular , the identity matrix of @xmath7 is @xmath8 , and given @xmath9 , @xmath10 , we write as usual @xmath11 also , in what follows we utilize the standard terminology for sobolev spaces and norms . however , given a domain @xmath12 , a closed lipschitz curve @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , we simplify notations and define @xmath15 ^ 3\\,,\\quad \\mathbb h^r(\\mathcal",

    "the resulting arnold - falk - winther ( afw ) element with the lowest polynomial degrees , which is referred to as of order @xmath599 , and which certainly constitutes another feasible choice verifying @xmath593 , @xmath524 , and @xmath582 , consists of piecewise linear approximations for the stress @xmath50 and piecewise constants functions for both the velocity @xmath48 and vorticity @xmath326 unknowns .    in turn",
    ", the bilinear form @xmath131 involved in @xmath551 corresponds also to the one arising from the mixed formulation of the linear elasticity problem in @xmath1 , but now with dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath0 and non - homogeneous neumann boundary condition on @xmath42 .",
    "as stated at the beginning of section [ section63 ] , we recall here that a different meshsize @xmath477 is assumed to define the finite element subspace @xmath600 of @xmath546 . in other words ,",
    "we consider a partition @xmath601 of @xmath42 that is independent of the partition @xmath602 of @xmath42 inherited from a regular triangulation @xmath603 of @xmath1 . in this case ,",
    "given an integer @xmath604 , and denoting the classical peers from @xcite by peers@xmath605 , we first take either peers@xmath598 or bdms@xmath598 ( when @xmath597 ) to define the triple @xmath595 , and then let @xmath600 be the space of continuous piecewise polynomials on @xmath601 of degree @xmath606 .",
    "similarly , one could also take the above described afw element of order @xmath599 and set @xmath600 as the space of continuous piecewise polynomials on @xmath601 of degree @xmath607 .",
    "hence , proceeding analogously as in the proofs of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmata 4.1 , 4.2 , and 4.3 ) , one can easily show that for each one of the foregoing choices there exist @xmath608 , independent of @xmath387 and @xmath477 , such that whenever @xmath609 , the hypothesis @xmath551 is satisfied with the constant @xmath610 .",
    "we can also refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 7.5 ) for a closely related argument .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see that the above described pairs of finite element subspaces @xmath611 ( or @xmath612 ) also verify the respective hypotheses @xmath613 , @xmath527 , @xmath554 , and @xmath584 , which imply that the first components of the discrete kernels of @xmath131 and @xmath107 become all free divergent .",
    "in addition , it is clear that the corresponding subspaces @xmath614 satisfy the approximation property required by @xmath615 .",
    "moreover , it is quite straightforward to notice that the first condition in @xmath529 , and @xmath555 , are both satisfied by any of the previously mentioned choices of @xmath516 .",
    "next , with respect to the boundary element subspaces of @xmath389 and @xmath468 , we first let @xmath616 and @xmath617 be independent partitions of @xmath0 , with @xmath616 being the one inherited from a regular triangulation @xmath603 of @xmath1 . hence , in order to satisfy the regularity assumption @xmath618 and the inverse inequality @xmath619 , it suffices to consider an integer @xmath604 , set @xmath465 as the space of continuous piecewise polynomials on @xmath617 of degree @xmath606 , and define @xmath469 as the intersection of @xmath468 with @xmath465 .",
    "similarly , defining @xmath517 as the space of continuous piecewise polynomials on @xmath616 of degree @xmath606 , we find that the second condition in @xmath529 , and @xmath585 , follow straightforwardly from the fact that @xmath620 is certainly contained in the space of continuous piecewise polynomials on @xmath616 of degree @xmath607 . on the other hand , concerning @xmath532 and @xmath556 , we just remark that the existence of @xmath621 and @xmath622 satisfying the required conditions in those hypotheses , follows by simply adapting the procedure suggested in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paragraph right before lemma 8) to the present 3d case ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.2 ) ) . to this end , we just need to define @xmath517 ( resp .",
    "@xmath600 ) as any subspace of @xmath389 ( resp .",
    "@xmath546 ) containing the space of continuous piecewise polynomials on @xmath616 ( resp .",
    "@xmath602 ) of degree @xmath607 .    finally , while the definitions of @xmath469 and @xmath316 ( cf .",
    ", , , and ) are theoretically correct , we remark that for the sake of the computational implementation of the corresponding galerkin schemes , it will be better off to introduce lagrange multipliers handling the orthogonality conditions defining these boundary element subspaces .",

    "<S> in particular , following a similar analysis given recently for the laplacian , we are able to extend the classical johnson & ndlec procedure to the present case , without assuming any restrictive smoothness requirement on the coupling boundary , but only lipschitz - continuity . in addition , and differently from known approaches for the elasticity problem , we are also able to extend the costabel & han coupling procedure to the 3d stokes problem by providing a direct proof of the required coerciveness property , that is without argueing by contradiction , and by using the natural norm of each space instead of mesh - dependent norms . finally , we briefly describe concrete examples of discrete spaces satisfying the aforementioned hypotheses .    </S>",
