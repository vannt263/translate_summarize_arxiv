    "the revolution in the understanding of the present universe has become possible due to the research in observational cosmology in the past two decade .",
    "recent observational data from plank collaboration @xcite , baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) @xcite and atacama cosmology telescope polarimeter ( actpol ) collaboration @xcite provides relevant experimental evidence about the acceleration of our universe . in the last century",
    ", modern cosmology reached a new vision to establish considerable advancements in the account of the current accelerated expanding universe .",
    "the two crucial observational groups including supernovae cosmology project and the high - redshift supernovae search team have provided the main evidence for the cosmic acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "the other cosmic observations like cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations @xcite , large - scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , cosmic microwave radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite indicate that the present universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "it is also believed that the universe changed with time from early deceleration phase to late time acceleration phase @xcite .",
    "now , a team of scientists led by professor subir sarkar @xcite has raised the question on this standard cosmological concept about the acceleration , which is also supported by shariff et al .",
    "+ the two promising approaches confirmed by the cosmological research community for discussing the cosmic expansion of the universe are : the first one is the introduction of the most exotic entity of mysterious universe dubbed as dark energy , which has positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "recently , from plank cosmological results and wilkson microwave anisotropic probe ( wamp ) 9 years results @xcite , it may be concluded that the universe embodied with 68.5% dark energy , 26.5% of dark matter and 5% of baryonic matter .",
    "dark energy can be represented either in terms of cosmological constant or by the help of equation of state parameter ( eos ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the pressure and @xmath7 is the energy density .",
    "+ the second approach to picturize the evolution of the universe is a modified version of einstein s field equations of general relativity , which can be established through the einstein - hilbert action principle . in this process , the matter lagrangian is replaced by an arbitrary function .",
    "thereafter , these modified theories become most attractive aspirant to observe the accelerated expansion of the universe as well as the effective causes related to dark energy .",
    "+ in addition , it has been postulated that the standard einstein - hilbert action is modified by an arbitrary function @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is ricci scalar curvature .",
    "the @xmath8 gravity become an adequate theory to provide the gravitational alternative for dark energy and about the early inflation plus late - time cosmic acceleration of the universe @xcite . in 2007 ,",
    "the @xmath8 gravity theory is restructured by merging the matter lagrangian density @xmath9 with initial arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the unification of dark energy and early time inflation with late time acceleration from @xmath8 theory to all lorentz non - invariant theories is discussed by nojiri and odintsov @xcite . through continuation of this work of coupling , in 2011 , harko et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new modified theory named as @xmath0 theory , where the gravitational part of the action still depends on the ricci scalar @xmath1 like @xmath8 theories and also a function of trace @xmath2 .",
    "it is suggested that due to the matter - energy coupling , the leading model of this theory depends on source term representing the variation of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "indefinitely many modified gravitational theories such as @xmath10 gravity , @xmath11 gravity , and @xmath12 gravity etc . were developed to achieve the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "myrzakulov et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the inflation in @xmath13 theories of gravity where the scalar field is coupled with gravity .",
    "sebastiani and myrzakulov @xcite have briefly reviewed various @xmath8 gravity models for inflation , in particular , starobinsky - like inflation .",
    "after that , @xmath0 gravity become most prominent theory for investigating the fate of the late time accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "a phase transition also occurred from matter - dominated era to an accelerated phase during the reconstruction of @xmath0 gravity theory @xcite .",
    "in the context of common perfect fluid matter , an axially symmetric cosmological model was constructed in the framework of @xmath0 gravity @xcite . in @xmath0 gravity theory , many cosmological models can be constructed changing choices in matter source .",
    "sahoo and mishra @xcite constructed kaluza - klein dark energy model by considering the wet dark fluid matter source .",
    "recently , moraes et al .",
    "@xcite derived the starobinksy model in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "+ by considering the metric dependent lagrangian density @xmath9 , the respective field equation for @xmath0 gravity is formulated from the hilbert - einstein variational principle in the following manner : @xmath14where , @xmath15 is the usual matter lagrangian density of matter source , @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of ricci scalar @xmath1 and the trace @xmath2 of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath16 of the matter source , and @xmath17 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath18 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath16 from lagrangian matter is defined in the form @xmath19and its trace is @xmath20.here , we have assumed that the matter lagrangian @xmath15 depends only on the metric tensor component @xmath18 rather than its derivatives .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath21by varying the action @xmath22 in eq .",

    "we get @xmath29where @xmath30.from eqs ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , the @xmath0 gravity field equations takes the form @xmath31it is worth mentioning here that the physical nature of the matter field through @xmath32 is used to form the field equations of @xmath0 gravity . to construct different kinds of cosmological models according to the choice of matter source , harko et al .",
    "@xcite constructed three types of @xmath0 gravity as presented below @xmath33the individual field equations for each frames of @xmath0 gravity is given as + case - i : @xmath3 @xmath34",
    "case - ii : @xmath4 @xmath35 most of the researchers constructed cosmological models in the presence of perfect fluid matter to analyse the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "recent observations provide the evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe due to the presence of an unknown form of energy ( dark energy ) having negative pressure . on that account",
    ", we need to construct a cosmological model for expanding universe without considering dark energy and dark matter , while choosing most reliable matter component .",
    "it is believed that the cosmic viscosity acts as the dark energy candidate which may play an important role in causing the accelerated expansion of the universe by consuming negative effective pressure @xcite . at present , there is great interest in formulating the cosmological model with dissipative fluid matter rather than with dust ( a pressure - less distribution ) or with a perfect fluid matter , which gives more realistic model instead of others and most effective to pay attention to the dynamical background of homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "it is commonly accepted that , in the early phase of the universe , the matter behaved like a viscous fluid during the neutrino decoupling in radiation era @xcite .",
    "the nature of singularity occurred for perfect fluid can be modified through the dissipative mechanism of viscous fluid .",
    "this viscous fluid cosmological model helps to explain the matter distribution on the large entropy per baryon in the present universe .",
    "also , the phase transition and string creation are involved with viscous effects as per the grand unified theories ( gut ) .",
    "it has been found that the mixture of minimally coupled self - interacting scalar field can successfully derive an accelerated expansion of the universe , while the same mixture with perfect fluid unable to do it @xcite .",
    "hence , many cosmological models with viscous fluid in the early universe have been widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "again , observations have been conducted to obtain the homogeneity and isotropic properties of the universe .",
    "it is believed that at the end of the inflationary era , the geometry of the universe was homogeneous and isotropic @xcite , where the flrw models played an important role is representing both spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe . but the theoretical argument and the anomalies found in cmb provide the evidence for the existence of an anisotropic phase , which is later called isotropic one . after the announcement of plank probe results @xcite , it is believed that the early universe may not have been exactly uniform .",
    "thus , the existence of inhomogeneous and anisotropic properties of the universe has gained popularity when it comes to constructing cosmological models under the supervision of anisotropic background .",
    "therefore , bianchi type models are very relevant for describing the early universe with the anisotropic background . due to some analytical difficulties in studying the inhomogeneous models , many researchers considered the bianchi type models for investigating the cosmic evolution of the early universe as they are homogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "there exist nine types ( @xmath36 ) of bianchi space - times in literature . here , we consider bianchi type - i space - time , as it is the simplest spatially homogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "it is also known as the immediate generalization of the flrw flat metric with different scale factors in each spatial direction . in some special cases ,",
    "the bianchi type - i models include _ kasner metric _ , which helps to govern the dynamics near the singularity .",
    "the bianchi type - i cosmological models are more compatible with the simplest mathematical form which attracts various researcher to study different aspects .",
    "the nature of bianchi type - i cosmological model has been studied in the context of a viscous fluid .",
    "it has been observed that viscosity can cause the qualitative behaviour of solutions near the singularity without removing the total initial big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "recently , the bulk viscous matter content has been discussed along with cosmological constant in the framework of bianchi type - i space time @xcite .",
    "later , the spatially homogeneous anisotropic bianchi type - i model with bulk viscous fluid matter was studied with the assumption of constant deceleration parameter in the framework of @xmath0 gravity theory through the explanation of the energy conditions @xcite.this work is motivated by the aforesaid literature .",

    "<S> the objective of this work enclosed with the study of spatially homogeneous anisotropic bianchi type - i universe in @xmath0 gravity ( where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar and @xmath2 is the trace of stress energy momentum tensor ) in two different cases viz . @xmath3 and @xmath4 with bulk viscosity matter content . in this study , we consider a time varying deceleration parameter , which generates an accelerating universe to obtain the exact solution of the field equations . </S>",
    "<S> the physical and kinematical properties of both the models are discussed in detail for the future evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we have explored the nature of wec , dec , sec and energy density for both the cases . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that both the models , with bulk viscosity matter component , show an acceleration of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the cosmic jerk parameter is compatible with the three kinematical data sets . </S>"
