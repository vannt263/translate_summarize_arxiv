    "there has been a significant increase of interest in the foundations of quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "this owes undoubtedly to the technological progress achieved during the last decades in experimental investigation of how quantum systems behave not only statistically , but on an individual level .",
    "in fact , there are experimental results for microscopic systems which appear to be naturally explained by resorting to collapse of wave function@xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , wave function collapse has ever been the source of the problem in understanding and interpreting qm , and there is still no definitive consensus on the `` measurement '' problem . accordingly , along with those which accept the collapse postulate , there are many other interpretations , such as de broglie - bohm causal interpretation@xcite , statistical interpretation@xcite , decoherence@xcite , modal interpretations@xcite , consistent ( decoherent ) histories@xcite , many - worlds / minds interpretations@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we aim to investigate a realistic model of wave function collapse .",
    "first of all , it is totally unsatisfactory to connect wave function collapse with an act of measurement , because the concept of measurement is ill - defined@xcite . to describe wave function collapse from a realistic standpoint",
    ", we have to specify a well - defined dynamics of the stochastic process of collapse . in this regard , there are long - standing studies on stochastic nonlinear equations to realize collapse effectively .",
    "on the one hand , models to cause rapid but continuous collapse in the sense of brownian motion were studied by bohm and bub@xcite , pearle@xcite , disi@xcite , and gisin@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a model postulating discontinuous instantaneous collapse was elaborated in the pioneering work by ghirardi , rimini and weber ( grw)@xcite . at present",
    ", the grw model and the pearle model have been jointly developed to the continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model@xcite .",
    "mathematically , csl is based on a stochastically modified schrdinger equation .",
    "the current status of studies on what are and have to be achieved in their models has been reviewed extensively@xcite . on the basis of the idea of spontaneous collapse ( sc ) , which may have a clue to the measurement problem , a good deal of related works are published indeed@xcite .",
    "the task of theories based on and accounting for sc is to specify when , how and how often the collapse occurs , and to investigate the physical consequences .",
    "this is particularly important because the effect of sc must be physically relevant , in striking contrast to the other interpretations .",
    "the predictions of collapse theories should more or less deviate from those of standard quantum mechanics ( sqm ) .    in this paper , we propose and investigate another such model of similar physical implications as the original grw model .",
    "we also introduce two constants to characterize the dynamics of collapse . in the grw model , a wave function is subjected to incessant spontaneous localizations , or the wave function is multiplied by a localization function , e.g. , the gaussian function , of which the frequency and the localization width are postulated to be universal constants , @xmath0sec@xmath1 and @xmath2 cm , respectively .",
    "the grw localization mechanism is such that its frequency increases as the number @xmath3 of constituents of a composite system increases , so that a macroscopic object comprising an avogadro number of constituents collapses extremely rapidly , at a rate of @xmath4sec@xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , we propose to postulate a constant collapse rate @xmath5 , while we model that the localization functions , particularly its length scale , are variable and depend on the wave function to suffer collapse . in effect",
    ", we introduce an energy scale @xmath6 so that the stochastic collapse should occur to the effect to cost energy @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , in our model , the macroscopic number @xmath3 does not play any essential role , so that the effect of collapse may manifest itself even in microscopic systems@xcite .    after introducing our collapse model in section [ sec:2 - 1 ] ,",
    "we discuss the physical implications of the model in section [ sec:2 - 2 ] and in section [ sec:3 ] . by way of illustration , in section [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we apply the modified dynamics to obtain numerical results for one - dimensional systems .",
    "although we are mainly interested in the individual dynamical evolution of a particular system , we briefly discuss the statistical description of the system in terms of the density matrix in section [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "we state our conclusion in section [ sec : conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "[ ap : vari ] , we give an analytical treatment of a simple special case of the model to support general discussions in the main text .",
    "we discuss a generalization required to treat many particle systems in appendix [ ap : many ] .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that the proposed model provides us with a consistent picture of crossover between quantum and classical mechanics .",
    "we discuss a non - relativistic model of spontaneous collapse .",
    "let us consider the normalized state @xmath8 as a function of space @xmath9 and time @xmath10 , where the indices representing internal quantum degrees of freedom like spins are suppressed for simplicity .",
    "we postulate that @xmath11 after the infinitesimal elapse of time @xmath12 is determined from @xmath8 stochastically as follows : ( i ) with the probability @xmath13 , @xmath14",
    "while ( ii ) @xmath15 with the probability @xmath16 , where @xmath17 in ( [ wndef ] ) , the sum over the suppressed indices is implicit in the definition of the modulus square @xmath18 , which thus represents the density in ordinary space . unlike ( i )",
    ", the process ( ii ) is discontinuous by postulate , so that it can not be put into a differential equation , though we can take the limit @xmath19 without affecting the physical content of the model .",
    "the branching structure of the proposed dynamics is schematically summarized in fig .  [ fig : chart ] . according to the modified dynamics ,",
    "the quantum state @xmath20 is subjected to collapse ( ii ) with the constant rate @xmath21 .",
    "the probability to keep following the deterministic evolution ( i ) for @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "the collapse rate @xmath21 , or the time @xmath25 , is the first parameter of our model .        in ( [ 2ndlaw ] ) ,",
    "the effect of collapse is described by the real - valued continuous envelop functions @xmath26 , which we call the localization functions , following the grw model .",
    "the factor @xmath27 in ( [ 2ndlaw ] ) is to normalize the collapse outcomes , @xmath28 .",
    "the functions @xmath26 have to satisfy @xmath29 in order to meet the conservation of probability , @xmath30 to achieve spontaneous localization , the grw model assumes @xmath26 to be the gaussian functions with a fixed width centered at random positions .",
    "we postulate rather that a set of the real functions @xmath26 is determined optimally depending on the state @xmath31 so as to maximize @xmath32 under the constraint @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the physical changes of entropy and energy due to collapse .",
    "they are defined customarily in terms of the density matrix @xmath36 of the collapse outcome . in real space representation ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath37 are given by @xmath38    the above is the procedure that we propose to fix the collapse outcomes @xmath39 resulting from an arbitrary state @xmath40 . from our standpoint to regard wave function collapse as a real process , ( [ deltas ] ) and ( [ deltae ] ) represent the physical changes accompanied by the collapse , both of which are the important quantities to characterize the stochastic irreversible process . thus ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) and ( [ sumnpnp2=1 ] ) respectively represent statistical conservation of ` free energy ' @xmath41 and the density , @xmath42 under these statistical constraints , we obtain the set of collapse outcomes @xmath43 by modifying to replace the squared amplitude @xmath44 of the initial state @xmath45 with @xmath46 without affecting the phase @xmath47 .",
    "thus , in a sense , we envisage the collapse as a kind of fragmentation of wave packet @xmath48 in real space .    in case where there happens to be non - equivalent sets of the localization functions @xmath49 for given @xmath31 , e.g. , by reason of symmetry",
    ", we require another postulate that a single set is chosen from among them at random with equal a priori probability .",
    "it would be clear that these postulates to formulate the probabilistic ` second law ' ( [ 2ndlaw ] ) are adopted on the analogy drawn from thermodynamics of the irreversible process of open systems immersed in a heat bath at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the constant @xmath6 is the second parameter of our model .",
    "we adopt ( [ s0 ] ) as a proper expression to implement the spontaneous tendency of collapse to reduce the spatial extent of the quantum state , @xmath50 thus we take account of the special role of the position basis in terms of @xmath51 . in effect , to minimize the variance @xmath52 means to maximize the second term in ( [ delr^2 ] ) , @xmath53 for the first term is independent of @xmath54 , @xmath55 the expression in ( [ sumnwn|int|2 ] ) is not easy to treat with formally . to serve our purpose of localization equally well , we shall rather adopt the expression ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "the positive sign in ( [ s0 ] ) is opposite to the conventional definition of entropy with a minus sign ( cf .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) ) .",
    "this is because we intend to describe the spontaneous tendency toward compact localization ( instead of diffusion ) of quantum states in terms of the physical quantity @xmath56 to be maximized . for simplicity , for the same purpose",
    ", we might as well maximize a simpler expression like @xmath57 nevertheless , ( [ s0 ] ) has a physically preferable feature for the purpose of generalization ( see appendix  [ ap : many ] ) .",
    "it is stressed that the physical implications of the proposed modified dynamics , which are discussed in what follows , are not affected qualitatively by whichever quantity one shall adopt to realize localization .",
    "the results of our primary concern are essentially the consequences of the very idea that stochastic collapse tends to reduce the spatial extent of wave packet as small as possible to the extent to cost energy @xmath7 by ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) , or that the collapse outcomes are variably determined depending on the state @xmath40 to be reduced .      by construction ,",
    "the non - trivial effect of collapse becomes negligible in the limit @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , in the time regime appreciably shorter than @xmath59 , the quantum results based on the deterministic evolution ( i ) remain intact .",
    "hence , we may regard the short time regime @xmath60 as a quantum regime .    in the long run @xmath61 , however , the standard quantum predictions based on the strict validity of the unitary evolution ( i ) alone have to be modified more or less .",
    "one of the most notable consequences of the collapse model is the violation of energy conservation @xmath62@xcite , which is taken for granted in the above model through ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) . with the physical entropy @xmath63 created upon collapse ,",
    "the rate of energy production is given by @xmath64 , which must be negligibly small in practice .",
    "for definiteness , let us discuss the system described by the hamiltonian @xmath65 for which we obtain @xmath66 without approximation .",
    "it is noted that ( [ deltae2 ] ) depends on the potential @xmath67 only implicitly through the ` probability ' density @xmath68 in general , for an observable @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70_- \\psi_t({\\bf r } )   % \\langle \\psi|   [ \\hat{o},p_n({\\bf r})]_-|\\psi\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] even when @xmath69 and @xmath26 commute , @xmath71_- = 0 , $ ] the collapse ( [ 2ndlaw ] ) conserves the expectation value @xmath72 only statistically , @xmath73 , so that we should generally expect @xmath74 individually . for instance , the center of mass @xmath75 will fluctuate as we follow the individual behavior of a particular state evolving according to the modified dynamics ( cf .",
    "[ fig : free2 ] ) .    according to ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) and ( [ deltae2 ] ) , in the limit @xmath76",
    ", we conclude @xmath77 constant if @xmath78 for any @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , in this case , we recover not only the energy conservation @xmath79 , but also the quantum limit with no collapse effectively .",
    "this is because the collapse ( [ 2ndlaw ] ) with the constant @xmath80 has no physical effect at all , for the collapse outcomes become physically all equivalent to the pre - collapse state , @xmath81 .",
    "hence , as well as @xmath58 , the limit @xmath76 may also be called the quantum limit . nevertheless ,",
    "in contrast to the former limit , all the standard quantum results are not recovered in the latter .",
    "as discussed below in section [ sec:3 - 3 ] , our modified dynamics eventually gives predictions against sqm even at @xmath82 .",
    "according to the modified dynamics presented above , the spatial extent of the wave packet @xmath20 is regularly truncated down to a finite size . without detailed calculation ,",
    "we can make an order estimate of the length scale of the wave packet under spontaneous collapse .",
    "owing to the constraint ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) , even in free space @xmath83 , the energy scale @xmath6 introduces the length @xmath84 which is nothing but the thermal de broglie wavelength at `` temperature '' @xmath6 .",
    "accordingly , we conclude the finite wave packet width of order @xmath85 , which brings about our purpose to reproduce classical mechanics of the point mass @xmath86 in the macroscopic limit @xmath87 where @xmath88 , without introducing any external observer . the finite width ( [ lam0 ] ) from ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) is just as expected by the thermodynamic analogy mentioned above . in effect , the degree of localization @xmath52 depends on the energy @xmath89 required for the localization . if it were not for the constraint ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) , or if we let @xmath90 , the hypothetical spontaneous collapse would reduce @xmath52 without limit , and the established results of quantum mechanics at a short length scale must be spoiled altogether .",
    "thus , in the present model , the crossover length scale presumed between classical and quantum regimes is brought in by the non - trivial scale @xmath6 in a controlled manner .",
    "the position @xmath75 of the free particle fluctuates with the amplitude of the order of @xmath91 . in principle",
    ", the finite value of @xmath92 should give rise to non - trivial quantum corrections to newton s equation of classical mechanics for the approximately well - defined position @xmath93 of the body .",
    "nevertheless , it has to be remarked that the non - trivial effects due to @xmath91 can not necessarily be conspicuous in real situations , because they may be completely masked by environmental decoherence , the effects of which have been intensively discussed for decades@xcite . in effect , as we see below , the scale @xmath6 of collapse should be substantially subtler than any perturbations of practical relevance .",
    "still it would not be impractical to expect that the non - trivial predictions of the model , namely , the intrinsic decoherence of the constant rate @xmath21 , might survive the extrinsic disturbances in some controlled situations .",
    "let us turn our attention to the microscopic system for which @xmath94 defined in ( [ lam0 ] ) is substantially larger than the typical length scale @xmath95 of the system .",
    "the latter is determined by the kinetic as well as potential terms in the hamiltonian .    to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the wave packet whose linear dimension is of order @xmath96 .",
    "we represent by @xmath97 the typical length scale over which the localization functions @xmath80 change appreciably . as we noted at the end of the last section ,",
    "if @xmath78 for any @xmath9 , then we should obtain @xmath98 .",
    "as a result , we conclude that the collapse has little effect on the quantum state , viz . , @xmath99 .",
    "for example , in the limit @xmath100 , the localized wave packet @xmath101 is hardly affected by the postulated collapse . hence the effect of ( ii ) may be schematically expressed as @xmath102 we conclude @xmath103 accordingly .",
    "next , we consider the case in which the opposite limit @xmath104 may be realized , where the postulated collapse has a drastic effect .",
    "since @xmath105 in ( [ deltae2 ] ) takes a finite value @xmath106 for @xmath9 in the domain where @xmath80 varies , we obtain @xmath107 in which the factor @xmath108 denotes the spatial integral over the ` boundary ' of @xmath109 where @xmath110 for @xmath111 ( see ( [ varep = q ] ) ) .",
    "hence , by the constraint @xmath112 , we obtain @xmath113 or @xmath114 in terms of the density per length @xmath115 defined by @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , @xmath97 can be scaled down by the factor @xmath117 or @xmath115 , which may happen to be exponentially small , e.g. , when @xmath118 is represented by a linear superposition of well separated wave packets .",
    "for example , let us consider a typical case of an ` unstable ' linear superposition of the localized wave packet ( [ gaussian ] ) , @xmath119 where @xmath120 . for @xmath20 with @xmath121 , we find @xmath122 to give @xmath123 . as a result of collapse , therefore , we obtain @xmath124 with the probabilities @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "the point is that the two states @xmath127 and @xmath128 have little spatial overlap , so that it hardly costs energy to reduce @xmath129 of the initial wave packet ( [ psi = c+phi+c- ] ) down to @xmath95 for ( [ psitophisigma ] ) , which is ` stable ' in the sense of ( [ phisigtophisig ] ) . indeed , for definiteness , owing to @xmath130 , we obtain @xmath131 for @xmath121 .",
    "thus the localization functions are approximately represented by the step functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : doublewell2 ] and [ fig : pn ] ) .",
    "this is essentially how born s rule follows from our modified dynamics .",
    "the above argument is based on the emergence of the different scales @xmath138 through ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) . as a function of the separation @xmath139 ,",
    "the qualitative change of behavior from ( [ phisigtophisig ] ) to ( [ psitophisigma ] ) occurs around @xmath140 , which is independent of @xmath6 . in other words , according to ( [ lambdasimeqlambda0q ] ) , the microscopic scale @xmath97 for @xmath80 may be derived as the product of @xmath94 , which must be larger than any other length scales of a microscopic quantum system , times the exponentially small factor @xmath141 .",
    "although the former depends on @xmath6 , it is essentially the latter factor @xmath117 that provides us with the smallest scale @xmath97 of @xmath80 .",
    "thus the qualitative features discussed above do not depend sensitively on the precise value of @xmath6 , but are mainly determined by the density distribution of the state @xmath20 .       before the recombination , e.g. , if the length @xmath142 of the impenetrable partition slab separating the two paths is made larger than a coherence length @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the velocity of the incoming wave packet . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the modified dynamics describes the ` measurement ' involving wave function collapse as a stochastic process to minimize @xmath92 of the wave function @xmath40 .",
    "it serves our purpose that those classically inadmissible superposition states of well separated wave packets like ( [ psi = c+phi+c- ] ) are destabilized to decay with the finite lifetime @xmath59 . in principle , the non - trivial physical effects of the model should be manifested themselves in the interference experiments which are devised to distinguish the pure state @xmath40 from the statistical mixture of the collapse outcomes @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , we are led to an unconventional prediction of the destruction of the quantum interference pattern , as schematically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds ] .",
    "since such an intrinsic decoherence is concluded independently of the actual distance between the separated wave packets in superposition , we must also conclude seemingly unfavorable consequences for the microscopic single - particle states with nodes along which the density vanishes , @xmath145 .",
    "in contrast to ( [ phisigtophisig ] ) for ( [ gaussian ] ) , e.g. , the wave function @xmath146 for @xmath100 can not but be halved to result in the effectively nodeless collapse outcomes @xmath147 ; @xmath148 as one obtains @xmath149 in this case .",
    "in short , the modified dynamics predicts that wave functions with nodes generally have to be nodeless eventually .",
    "it is clear that such drastic unconventional collapse processes must not intervene the conventional schrdinger time evolution too frequently .",
    "thus we have to require the collapse time @xmath59 to be substantially slower than any practical coherence time scales for the quantum interference of spatially separated wave packets .      in practice",
    ", the numerical value for @xmath6 must be properly chosen such that the characteristic length @xmath94 for microscopic particles like electron and neutron must be too large while the intrinsic wave packet widths @xmath94 for macroscopic bodies , which may be effectively regarded as material points , are too small to be unexpectedly detected experimentally . to put it concretely , in order to guarantee @xmath150 m for electron while @xmath151 m for a tiny particle of a nanogram , we estimate @xmath152 hence there is a relatively wide range open for @xmath6 , owing to the above note that the model is relatively insensitive to @xmath6 .    on the other hand , we must assume the collapse time @xmath59 to be larger than a typical coherence time scale of microscopic quantum phenomena , as mentioned in the last subsection .",
    "nonetheless , at the same time , @xmath59 must be shorter than a typical scale of macroscopic classical phenomena in order to warrant definite outcomes for classical bodies approximately at any time , i.e. , to prevent such an embarrassing superposition state of ` classical ' states with ` distinct ' spatial configurations from developing and lasting for a long while",
    ". therefore one may make a rough estimate like @xmath153 , so we find that the parameter range allowed for @xmath59 is more restricted than @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , we consider that whether we could assume @xmath59 properly would be the crucial point for the present model to be viable physically . in",
    "what follows , we discuss the implications of the model assuming that experiments do not exclude room for the model parameters .    without being affected by the collapse",
    ", the wave packet evolves according to ( [ 1stlaw ] ) for the duration of order @xmath59 . in the meantime",
    ", the width @xmath154 for a free particle grows up to @xmath155 , so that the second length scale must be introduced if @xmath156 .",
    "however , with the above estimate of @xmath6 taken for granted , this limit must be rejected physically , because we hardly accept @xmath59 as long as @xmath157  second on physical grounds .",
    "hence it is valid to use the single length scale ( [ lam0 ] ) in free space , since we can consistently assume @xmath158 without invalidating the model .",
    "to give shape to the model , we investigate motion of a particle in one dimension .",
    "the unmodified schrdinger equation may be written in a dimensionless form , @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 . as discussed above , for macroscopic classical bodies ,",

    "the suppression of a coherent quantum motion by frequent `` measurements '' is generally known as the quantum zeno effect@xcite .",

    "to realize such , we solved a simple model as indicated in fig .",

    "this behavior corresponds to the transition from ( [ phisigtophisig ] ) to ( [ psitophisigma ] ) . in general , we associate the `` measurement '' of a quantum particle with such an unordinary leap caused by a specially prepared external potential .",
    "these results demonstrate that the effect of collapse becomes conspicuous when the linear width @xmath191 of the wave packet exceeds the characteristic length scale @xmath94 , and that the collapse hardly affects the wave packet when @xmath192 . therefore ,",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , we obtain a picture in that quantum ( wave ) mechanics obtains in the one limit @xmath193 , while classical ( particle ) mechanics ( with a definite path ) emerges in the other limit @xmath88 .",

    "consequently , in the statistical ensemble , the phenomenological effects of collapse apparent at the individual level can be completely masked by environmental decoherence@xcite .",
    "in other words , the discontinuity due to collapse as indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig : free2 ] and [ fig : doublewell2 ] would be averaged out at the statistical level .",
    "last but not least , the theory discussed throughout the paper is essentially non - relativistic .",
    "this is evident from a special role we assigned to time @xmath10 .",
    "it is still noteworthy that the model formulated with @xmath118 is galilei invariant .",
    "the conflict of the instantaneous collapse with special relativity has been elucidated@xcite . in this regard ,",
    "we only note a consistent if naive attitude to fit with the present model , that is , to assume a special frame of reference , as noted by eberhard@xcite and bell@xcite , in which the collapse dynamics applies specifically@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we addressed ourselves to the problem of how the classical world as we experience it emerges from the underlying laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "we investigated the motion of a quantum particle on the basis of the proposed modified dynamics of wave function collapse . in effect",
    ", the proposal may look complicated in practice , owing to the task of solving for the localization functions , but the model is simple in principle , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : chart ] .",
    "we describe the collapse dynamics in terms of physical quantities such as energy , entropy , and density in real space .",
    "the model contains two material - independent constants @xmath25 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is suggested on the analogy of the second law of thermodynamics in order to destabilize those linear superpositions of spatially separated wave packets , which are hardly interpretable from an ordinary , classical , realistic standpoint . on the basis of the proposal ,",
    "the numerical results are obtained as displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : free2]-[fig : doublewell2 ] .",
    "the model reproduces classical mechanics as a limit , yet it does not use the classical limit for its own formulation . according to the model , we obtain a unified mechanical picture in that the classical picture emerges on a long and large scale , @xmath208 and @xmath209 , while the quantum picture applies in the opposite limits , @xmath60 and @xmath210 , where @xmath97 denotes the natural linear dimension of the wave packet determined according to the model .",
    "in fact , the length scale @xmath97 of collapse depends on circumstances , and it can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "this is particularly the case for a microscopic particle subjected to measurement - related situations , where one can devise an apparatus to make @xmath97 as small as one likes , in principle .",
    "in principle , it is possible to write down the equations for @xmath26 , that is , the equations to determine the collapse outcome states @xmath211 .",
    "however , it is generally difficult to solve them for an arbitrary state @xmath20 analytically . in this appendix",
    ", we investigate the simplest tractable case where a wave packet is justly halved with equal probability by collapse .",
    "we obtain the localization functions @xmath212 and @xmath213 under the condition that the collapse probabilities to the two outcomes are equal , viz . , @xmath214 .",
    "to this end , the auxiliary function @xmath215 , ranging from 0 to @xmath216 , is introduced by @xmath217 and @xmath218 to take account of the constraint @xmath219 . in general , the collapse outcomes @xmath220 are not orthogonal , or the overlap integral @xmath221 does not vanish .",
    "hence the entropy production by the collapse is given by @xmath222 which takes the maximum value @xmath223 for @xmath224 , while the minimum is @xmath225 for @xmath226 .    in order to achieve the localization of wave function , to maximize @xmath227 in ( [ rho2 ] )",
    "is more easily implemented than to work with @xmath52 , ( [ delr^2 ] ) .",
    "hence , to start with , let us maximize @xmath228 under ( [ t0deltas = deltae ] ) , for which @xmath229 in terms of a lagrange multiplier @xmath230 , the equation for @xmath231 is obtained by the variation principle , @xmath232 from which we obtain the equation @xmath233 in particular , we are interested in the case @xmath234 and @xmath235 , where the model predicts the non - trivial result that the collapse outcomes @xmath236 and @xmath237 are distinctly different from each other , @xmath238 . to discuss this case further in depth , regarding @xmath231 as a function of @xmath185 for simplicity",
    ", we obtain the one - dimensional equation @xmath239 where @xmath240    the equation of a pendulum ( [ pendulum ] ) can be solved analytically . the solution with a proper boundary condition",
    "is given by @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the jacobian elliptic function .",
    "the origin of the @xmath185 axis has to be consistently chosen to give @xmath214 , i.e. , by @xmath243 the solution ( [ solutionsn ] ) for @xmath244 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] with the solid curve .",
    "note that the curve essentially represents the localization function @xmath245 , because @xmath246 to estimate the energy cost ( [ varepsilon0 ] ) to fix @xmath97 , we can make use of ` energy conservation ' of the pendulum motion ( [ pendulum ] ) , @xmath247 where @xmath248 from the last equations , we obtain @xmath249 hence , @xmath250 where @xmath251 with respect to the last approximation , we should note @xmath252 , while @xmath253 , and @xmath254 for @xmath255 .",
    "similarly , we may write ( [ overlap - p ] ) as @xmath256 with which @xmath257 must meet @xmath258 as well as ( [ inttanh=0 ] ) for consistency . given such @xmath118 , the parameter @xmath97 for @xmath26 is determined by @xmath259 , as in ( [ lambdasimeqlambda0q ] ) . in consequence ,",
    "we obtain the collapse outcomes @xmath260 .",
    "note in particular that @xmath80 becomes the step function in the limit @xmath261 , e.g. , as a result of the low density at @xmath262 , @xmath263 .",
    "then we recover the borns - rule probabilities @xmath264 together with the non - overlapping collapse outcomes @xmath54 , owing to @xmath265 . as is clear from the qualitative discussion in section  [ sec:3 - 2 ]",
    ", this feature is generic and not specific to the assumption @xmath266 .",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath185 .",
    "the solid and dashed curve are the solutions of ( [ pendulum ] ) and ( [ pendulum2 ] ) for @xmath244 , respectively .",
    "the dotted curve is a sine curve , which is added for reference .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in a similar manner , we can fix @xmath80 by maximizing ( [ s0 ] ) instead of @xmath227 , ( [ rho2=2int ] ) . to obtain @xmath54 from @xmath40 ,",
    "our task is to maximize @xmath267 where @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and @xmath270 is the lagrange multiplier to keep the postulated constraint @xmath271 . in the same approximations as above , in place of ( [ pendulum ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath272 where @xmath273 . a numerical solution @xmath274 for @xmath244 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] with the dashed curve .",
    "we find that the optimal shape of the localization function @xmath275 is not severely modified . for reference , a sinusoidal function @xmath276 for @xmath277",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] with the dotted curve .",
    "it is noted that the solution of ( [ pendulum2 ] ) gives a finite value for @xmath278 , which is the overlap width of @xmath279 .",
    "this is because the ` potential ' @xmath280 for ( [ pendulum2 ] ) makes the integral @xmath281 convergent , while ( [ vtheta ] ) makes this expression divergent .",
    "thus we obtain compact support of @xmath54 , which is a favorable feature of the model . moreover , from ( [ energy - conservation ] ) , we obtain @xmath282 as @xmath283 for the solution of ( [ pendulum2 ] ) , by which follows the continuity of @xmath284 as well as their derivatives as a function of @xmath185 . furthermore",
    ", as discussed below , the expression ( [ s0 ] ) is generalized adequately to describe independent collapse of many particle systems .",
    "in the main text , we focused on single - particle problems of the modified dynamics . to describe collapse of a many particle system , we have to generalize the localization functions to @xmath285 , which are to be multiplied with the @xmath3 particle wave function @xmath286 . accordingly",

    ", one should maximize @xmath290 instead of ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "in particular , when the @xmath3 particles are independent from each other , the wave function of the whole system is represented by the product of wave functions , @xmath291 for which one can regard formally that each of the states @xmath292 collapses independently , @xmath293 since ( [ sn ] ) is decomposed into a sum of @xmath3 independent terms , @xmath294 owing to @xmath295 .",
    "this is a feature to be expected physically .    for indistinguishable particles",
    ", the symmetry of the wave function @xmath40 must be respected , so that the localization functions @xmath285 must be symmetric under the exchange of the arguments .",
    "for definiteness , they are approximately given in terms of @xmath26 for a single particle state as follows .",
    "the simplest assumption is to regard them simply as functions of the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath296 , @xmath297 otherwise , they may be represented as symmetrized products of @xmath26 , @xmath298 where @xmath299 represents a set of integers @xmath300 and the sum in the right - hand side is taken over all different permutations of them , so that @xmath301 for identical particles , the following expression may equally serve our purpose , @xmath302 where @xmath303 denotes the particle density in terms of the number operator @xmath304 . in any case , the @xmath3 identical particles must evolve simultaneously as @xmath305 as they are not strictly independent from each other .    to treat the case where the particle number @xmath3 is variable",
    ", we have to generalize the collapse prescription furthermore to realize the localization on the number basis as well .",
