    "quantum computation is an attractive field on precision control of quantum systems . but",
    "quantum systems are inevitably influenced by the decoherence effect induced from the environment , which stands in the way of physical implementation of quantum computation . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", there are many strategies to correct or avoid errors during the implementation of the gate operations .",
    "the geometric phases @xcite and their non - abelian extensions , quantum holonomies @xcite , accompanying in evolutions of quantum systems , unveil important geometric structures in the description of the dynamics of quantum states .",
    "geometric phases depend only on global geometric properties of the evolution paths so that they are largely insensitive to many types of local noise . based on this distinct merit ,",
    "holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) , first proposed by zanardi and rasetti @xcite , has emerged as a promising strategy to implement universal quantum computation in a robust way @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the geometric phases , either abelian or non - abelian , consist of both adiabatic and non - adiabatic parts . in adiabatic evolution",
    ", it requires that quantum evolutions fulfill the famous adiabatic condition , and thus quantum gates constructed in this way generally have very slow speeds .",
    "this is unacceptable as the time needed for an adiabatic quantum gate maybe on the order of the coherence time of the used quantum two - level systems in typical systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , one needs to consult quantum gates based on non - adiabatic evolution @xcite , which does not require the adiabatic condition so that the gate speeds will only depend on the merits of the employed quantum systems . in this case , the built - in fault - tolerance of the non - adiabatic geometric phases provide a more practical way in implementing quantum computation .",
    "therefore , many renewed efforts have recently been given in this direction both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , as an another promising way to avoid the effect of decoherence , decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) can suppress the collective dephasing noise caused by the interaction between quantum systems and their environment @xcite .",
    "therefore , many efforts have been paid to combine the hqc with dfs encoding @xcite . in this way",
    ", one can consolidate the best of the two quantum computation strategies , i.e. , resilient against environment induced collective decoherence of the dfs approach and the operational robustness of the hqc against local noises .    here , we propose a non - adiabatic hqc ( nhqc ) scheme with dfs encoding based on nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers coupled commonly to the whispering - gallery mode ( wgm ) of a fused - silica microsphere cavity .",
    "the nv center system is considered as a promising candidate for physical implementation of quantum computation , due to its sufficiently long electronic spin lifetime as well as the possibility of coherent manipulation even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "since the electronic spins of the nv centers can be well initialized and manipulated in an optical way , quantum gates acting on the single - spin state can be obtained with very high efficiently @xcite .",
    "based on the symmetry structure of the system - environment interaction , we propose an encoding method of the logical qubits in the dfs , where any logical qubit state that undergoes a cyclic evolution will end up with a new state in the same subspace , without going out of the subspace .",
    "moreover , based on the numerical simulation under realistic conditions , we show that our nhqc scheme in dfs can realize a universal set of quantum gates with high fidelity .",
    "the setup we consider and the energy level configuration of the nv centers are schematically shown in fig . [ setup ] . in the cavity , the lowest - order wgm , corresponding to the light traveling around the equator of the microsphere , offers exceptional mode properties for reaching strong light - matter coupling . as shown in the fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) , @xmath1 nv centers , from separate diamond nano - crystals , are strongly coupled to the wgm of a microsphere cavity @xcite .",
    "the nv centers we considered can be modeled as three - level systems , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are encoded as our qubit states @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the state @xmath6 is labeled by @xmath7 and leave aside the metastable @xmath8 state , which has not yet been fully understood @xcite . in our implementation , the optical transition @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( with transition frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are coupled by the wgm with frequency @xmath13 and a classical laser filed with frequency @xmath14 @xcite , respectively .",
    "both coupling is far - off resonant from their transition frequencies so that the @xmath15 state can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "note that there is a degenerate state @xmath16 for the qubit state @xmath17 , these two degenerated states can be selectively addressed by the polarization of the optical field @xcite .",
    "the nv centers are fixed and the distance of two nv centers is much larger than the wavelength of the wgm , so that each driven laser field , with frequency @xmath18 and initial phase @xmath19 , can interact individually with an nv center and the direct coupling among the nv centers can be negligible .",
    "then the interaction of the whole quantum system , in units of @xmath20 , can be written as @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the wgm of the cavity , @xmath23 is the frequency of @xmath24th energy level of the identical nv centers with @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the coupling strength between @xmath28th nv center and the cavity ( laser ) . in the interaction picture with respect to the free hamiltonian @xmath29 , under the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , the interaction can be written as @xmath30 where we have assumed @xmath31 for simplicity , the effective cavity assisted interaction strength are @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "when two laser fields are applied to a pair of nv centers ( for example the @xmath37th and the @xmath38th ) , one can obtain the effective hamiltonian , under the condition of @xmath39 , as @xmath40 where @xmath41 . neglecting the level shift terms , which can be compensated by using additional lasers @xcite , the effective hamiltonian between the two nv centers reduces to @xmath42 with this hamiltonian ,",
    "we next show how a universal set of non - adiabatic holonomic gates can be implemented .",
    "now we turn to construct universal single logical qubit operations for the nhqc in dfs .",
    "it is noted that a logical qubit consists of two physical qubits is not sufficient for a dephasing environment @xcite .",
    "we here utilize three physical qubits to encode a logical qubit .",
    "the interaction between three physical qubits ( nv centers ) and the dephasing environment can be described by the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the collective dephasing operator and @xmath45 is an arbitrary environment operator . in this case , there exist a three - dimensional dfs of @xmath46 where the computational basis , i.e. , the logical qubit states , are encoded as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is used as a third ancillary state .    in order to implement the single logical qubit operation , we apply operation @xmath50 $ ] , which can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) for an operate time of @xmath51 , to the nv centers @xmath52 and @xmath53 by tuning laser beams with the same detuning @xmath54 from their respectively transition and phase difference @xmath55 .",
    "meanwhile , we also apply @xmath56 $ ] on nv centers @xmath53 and @xmath57 by tuning laser beams with the same detuning @xmath58 and identical phase .",
    "then , in the dfs @xmath59 the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath60 where the effective rabi frequency @xmath61 with @xmath62 and the phase @xmath63 can be tuned by the amplitude of the incident lasers .",

    ", the evolution operator @xmath70 can realize the holonomic gates with following two conditions .",
    "the first one is that controlling the operation time to meet @xmath71 .",
    "this condition will ensure the states evolving in the subspace @xmath72 undergo the cyclic evolution @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , the relation @xmath74 is always hold , which means the evolution is pure geometric and the parallel - transport condition is natural satisfied .",
