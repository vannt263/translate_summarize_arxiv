    "in quantum information we are often operating in a framework of separate distant laboratories , and the questions of what is possible or impossible under these local restrictions is crucial for understanding how we can use quantum resources in the best way . through these considerations",
    "we have come to see entanglement as a resource for example for quantum cryptography @xcite , teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite and measurement based quantum computing @xcite . beyond this",
    "however , when considering local access of information encoded onto quantum states , we have also seen non - local features without the presence of entanglement @xcite .    we now turn to consider the complement of this problem , that of local encoding of information . as well as being interesting in its own",
    "right as a local restricted task , and as a complement to local access of information ( and associated notions of locality ) , the ability to locally encode information is in fact an important part of many quantum information protocols . indeed",
    "the first stage of dense coding ( in fact , the encoding part ) is precisely local encoding of classical information .",
    "it is also strongly connected to the problem of local unitary equivalence which plays a large role in entanglement theory ( as we will see below ) .    in this paper",
    "we raise the question `` can we locally encode on all states ? '' .",
    "that is , given an arbitrary state , can we use this as a quantum resource and encode the maximum classical information possible .",
    "although this is a simple question , the answer is surprisingly difficult to find , and we find that we can not give a positive or negative answer , other than to give a large set of examples where we can encode , and show how to encode and we are unable to find any example that we can not locally encode .",
    "since classical information is completely distinguishable , the problem of encoding classical information on a state , becomes the problem of generating an orthogonal bases from that state .",
    "then , our question becomes `` is it possible to locally generate a complete basis from all states ? '' . in this way",
    "local encoding is related to local unitary equivalence of states . though we may naively expect this to be simple to answer , there are hints that it is a hard question , explaining why we have been unable to find the solution .",
    "the strongest such hint comes from the existence of unextendible product bases @xcite .",
    "this is a set of orthogonal product states who s compliment must be entangled - that is , it is impossible to find another state orthogonal this set which is product .",
    "this is an example where if we do not choose appropriate encoding operators , full local encoding is not possible ( even though there may exist another set of local operations to encode full classical information ) .",
    "we begin in section [ scn : general ] by considering the local encoding of general product states .",
    "our approach is then to take this encoding and extend it to sets of entangled states generated by unitaries which obey certain commutation relations .",
    "we concentrate on using pauli operations to encode on the states , where we develop the notion of _ pseudo _ clifford operations whose properties allow us to give a general sufficient condition for the ability to locally encode on a state . in particular this gives a method for locally encoding on all stabiliser states , including cluster states used in measurement based quantum computation @xcite , css error correction code states and all graph states @xcite . in section [ scn : symm states ] we show local encoding for sets of symmetric states as examples of non - clifford but pseudo clifford states . in section [ scn : group analysis ]",
    "we use group analysis to investigate what states can be locally encoded by the methods we have introduced .",
    "we note that although in our methods we are restrictive on the allowed encoding operations ( i.e. pauli and derived from the product state case ) , our approach manages to cover all the states we consider here , and we have no example of states which we can show can not be encoded by our methods .",
    "the problem of local encoding of classical information is equivalent to that of generating a basis by local operations .",
    "we begin by giving a formal definition of local encoding :    [ def : localencoding ] a @xmath0-qubit quantum state @xmath1 is said to be _ locally encodable _ if there exists a set @xmath2 of local unitary operations such that @xmath3 for all @xmath4 .",
    "we call such @xmath5 _ local encoders _ , and the set @xmath6 the _ local encoder set_.    by this definition , we can always ignore the global phase of the encoded state @xmath7 , since we only require orthogonality between the encoded states .",
    "the difficulty of finding the local encoder set lies in that the condition @xmath8 in definition [ def : localencoding ] is a weak condition , it only restricts the property of a local encoder set @xmath9 applied to the given state @xmath1 .",
    "given a state @xmath1 it is difficult to check if there exists an encoding set , since we must search over all possible local unitaries . in this sense",
    "it is too weak to be easily checkable .    in this paper",
    ", we take another approach to understand the properties of local encoding ; first we pose a restriction on the local encoder to be tensor products of the pauli operations @xmath10 represented by @xmath11 in the computational basis @xmath12 and obtain sufficient conditions for locally encodable states .",
    "then we consider gradually relaxing the restriction to find wider classes of states which are locally encodable and construction of the local encoder sets .",
    "our restriction of the local encoder set to consist of the pauli operations allows group theoretical analysis .",
    "the set of @xmath13 @xmath0-tensor product operations consisting of the pauli operators @xmath14 , together with their overall phase of @xmath15 or @xmath16 forms a group , which is called the _ pauli group _ , denoted by @xmath17 ( here we say the pauli group on @xmath0-qubits is given by the tensor products of all qubit pauli operators ) . including the phase factor ,",
    "the number of elements of the @xmath0-qubit pauli group is @xmath18 . for local encoding ,",
    "we ignore the global phase factor and only care about @xmath13 elements of pauli group operators .    to investigate local encoding",
    ", we use the properties of the pauli group and another group , the _ clifford group_. the clifford group is a group consisting of all operators which leave @xmath17 fixed under conjugation , and is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "formally , we write it as the set of operators @xmath20 .",
    "the clifford group is generated by combinations of the hadamard gate @xmath21 , the phase gate @xmath22 and the control - not gate @xmath23 represented in the computational basis by @xmath24 in addition to the pauli operations .",
    "we first consider encoding onto product states .",
    "we denote a local encoder for a zero state , which is @xmath0-tensor products of zero states defined by @xmath25 , by @xmath26 . for a simple product state such as @xmath27 ,",
    "it is apparent that a local encoder set is given by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , .... , @xmath31 .",
    "this construction is based on the fact that we can `` flip '' each single qubit state @xmath32 to @xmath33 by performing a pauli operation @xmath34 .",
    "all combinations of @xmath35 for @xmath0-qubits acting on @xmath27 give a set of states , which is a complete orthonormal set of the states denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "for convenience , we express this local encoder of the zero state by @xmath37 where a set of indices @xmath38 is a binary representation of @xmath39 .",
    "we now generalize this way of local encoding to any product state .",
    "a general @xmath0-qubit product state @xmath40 is represented by @xmath0-tensor products of single qubit states @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are positive parameters for @xmath44th qubit satisfying @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these parameters represent the angles of the state vector @xmath47 on the bloch sphere .",
    "we consider how to perform a flip operation using a _ minimum _ number of parameters for a general @xmath47 to make it as simple and general as possible .",
    "it is known that there is no universal flip operation for arbitrary states @xcite . if we know the two real parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we can always transform @xmath47 back into @xmath48 , so it is trivial to find the flip operation .",
    "in fact , we can describe a flip operation with just a single real parameter , since a state in the form of @xmath49 can be flipped by @xmath34 operation irrespective of the parameter @xmath42 . in the bloch sphere picture ,",
    "the state @xmath50 is on the @xmath51-plane , therefore the @xmath34 operation ( which is proportional to a @xmath52-rotation around the @xmath53-axis ) transforms @xmath50 into its orthogonal state @xmath54 . noting that a general single - qubit state @xmath47 is transformed to @xmath55 by a modified phase gate ( a rotation around the @xmath56-axis until the state lies on the @xmath57 plane ) @xmath58 the flip operation for each @xmath47 is given by @xmath59 .",
    "thus a possible local encoder set of a general product state @xmath40 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "our strategy now is to try to use our knowledge about the local encoder set of arbitrary product states for constructing the local encoders of entangled states . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a representation of a @xmath0-qubit state @xmath1 by using a ( generally non - local ) unitary operation @xmath62 on the zero state @xmath27 , namely , @xmath63 . we note that by this relation , the unitary operation @xmath62 is not uniquely determined , only the first column of @xmath62 is determined ( in the computational basis ) .    using the unitary representation ,",
    "the conditions for local encoding are written by @xmath64 .",
    "we rewrite this condition as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an arbitrary ( non - local ) unitary operator and @xmath67 .",
    "although the operators of @xmath68 are not necessary to be local in general , we investigate the cases where they are restricted to be local , therefore , they are given by the local encoder @xmath69 , for our purpose .",

    ". then we can immediately see that if @xmath62 is clifford , i.e. it maps every tensor product of pauli operators into another tensor product of pauli operators , thus if @xmath74 are pauli , then @xmath83 are also pauli .",

    "thus , @xmath62 can be taken to be in a larger class of operators than the clifford group operators .",

    "in this work we have looked at the possibility of encoding classical information onto quantum states by local unitary operations .",
    "we have presented explicit encodings for large sets of states including all stabiliser and various symmetric basis states .",
    "we have introduced the notion of pseudo clifford which unifies these states under one general local encoding method . finally , by resorting to group",
    "theoretic analysis we have given a method to find large sets of states with the same local encodings .",
    "although the methods used for local encoding presented here are not as general as possible , they do cover many interesting sets of states .",
    "it seems to be a difficult problem to describe the extent to which states are covered by our encoding strategies .",
    "it remains an open problem wether all states are locally encodable at all .",
    "we may also be interested in different ways of local encoding for other reasons and applications .",
    "for example in dense coding @xcite we wish to encode the information by acting on only a subset of the parties ( the idea being that then by sending that same subset through a quantum channel , we can communicate more information than the that allowed by the holevo bound ) .",
    "the local encoding presented here could not be used for such a protocol .",
    "we can then ask can we extend these results to consider such protocols , or what can our results say about when we can or can not .    for example , we know that for optimum dense coding , we must have a maximally entangled state between the senders and receivers .",
    "imagine we try to dense code using the state @xmath294 , where @xmath295 are the product states of the computational basis over the senders and receivers spaces for subscripts @xmath296 and @xmath297 respectively , and @xmath62 acts on @xmath22 only .",
    "the schmidt basis on the side of the senders ( subscript @xmath296 ) is in general entangled across the set of senders by unitary @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath62 is just identity , then we can encode simply using the pauli operators @xcite .",
    "surprisingly we can see that the senders can still encode the full basis locally , independent of @xmath62 .",
    "this can be easily shown , since for optimal dense coding , we would require @xmath298 for all @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath62 drops out and the condition is equivalent to simply @xmath299=0 $ ] .",
    "this is satisfied for the local pauli , hence they allow dense coding for these states . thus maximum entangled states can be always optimally locally dense coded independent of the schmidt basis .",
    "the same result can be obtained by using the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism @xcite by bringing the unitary over to the receiver s side @xmath300 . in this way",
    "it is clear that the standard pauli approach will work from @xcite .",
    "we can also note that some of the states considered here have mirror results in local decoding .",
    "it is known that the ability to decode such encoded classical information is bounded by the entanglement @xcite , and explicit bounds are given for @xmath301-states and large sets of graph states ( which , in the case of graph states , can be made tight @xcite ) .",
    "we can thus compare the amount of information we can encode to that we can decode @xmath302 . for graph states",
    "this gives @xmath303 ( where @xmath304 is the geometric measure of entanglement @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , from @xcite for all states where we can locally encode we have @xmath305 .",
    "this allows us to talk about a kind of irreversibility of local information - we can encode much easier than decode locally , and the difference is bounded by the entanglement .",
    "it is interesting to consider what such a quantity would mean in relation to other tasks such as measurement based quantum computing , error correction e.t.c .",
    "we see then that there are many open questions remaining , and that these results may have potential interest in various areas of quantum information processing and studies of locality .",
    "in addition we may also consider the usefulness of the task directly in many - party quantum cryptographic scenarios where we have distributed encoders and decoders .",
    "these will be the topics of ongoing study .",
