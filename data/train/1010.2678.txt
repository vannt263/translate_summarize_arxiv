    "<S> theoretical calculations indicate that this effect originates from a linear magnetoelectric effect related to spin - orbit coupling induced by the applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these properties make bifeo@xmath0 a promising medium for spin wave generation , conversion and control in future magnonics architectures .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetoelectric multiferroics possess coexisting magnetic and ferroelectric phases , with cross - correlation effects between magnetic and electric degrees of freedom@xcite . as such </S>",
    "<S> , they can potentially be used to control spin - based properties by electric fields@xcite , with very low associated power dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this feature appears promising not only for spintronics , in which information is encoded by the spin - polarization of the electrical current@xcite , but also for magnonics that use magnetic excitations ( spin waves ) for information processing@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , just as coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters exists in multiferroics , coupled spin and lattice excitations termed electromagnons have also been demonstrated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such mixed excitations exist at low temperature in multiferroic manganites@xcite and are suspected at room temperature in bifeo@xmath0@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the calculated curves show that cyclon and extra cyclon mode frequencies converge to two fixed points at the critical field @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between theory and experiment ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) gives an estimate of @xmath67  kv / cm ( above the maximum electric field of @xmath68  kv / cm that could be applied to our sample without damage ) . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data in the low field region ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , but a clear deviation occurs at high fields . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , cyclon and extra cyclon modes seem to merge for @xmath69 . this effect and </S>",
    "<S> the difference between theory and experiment at high fields might be due to other magnetoelectric interactions such as the dm and the flexoelectric interactions discussed above .    </S>",
    "<S> the demonstration of electrical control of spin wave states represents a significant step towards making new spin wave - based technologies . </S>",
    "<S> the cyclon spin wave dispersion can be written as @xmath70 , and the extra - cyclon dispersion as @xmath71 . for @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> the spin wave velocities are equal , @xmath73  cm / s @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , under an electric field of @xmath74  kv / cm the @xmath26 and @xmath27 spin wave velocities are tuned by @xmath75  cm / s , and @xmath76  cm / s respectively . while the speed of electron spin precession in a magnetic field is generally fixed by intrinsic properties of the materials considered </S>",
    "<S> , our work shows that in a multiferroic the spin wave speed can be continuously adjusted and in a different way depending on the spin propagating mode by the applied electric fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the frequency of spin waves can been tuned electrically by over 30% at room temperature in multiferroic bifeo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this electric - field dependence mimics that of the ferroelectric polarization , providing a handle for the non - volatile , low - power control of spin waves . </S>",
    "<S> thus , aside from its potential for spintronics@xcite and photonics@xcite , bifeo@xmath0 emerges as an exciting platform for testing novel magnonic device concepts , which further confirms it as a key multifunctional material for beyond - cmos technology . </S>"
