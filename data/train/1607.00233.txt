    "the first gravitational - wave detection by the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) on gw 150914 confirmed the existence not only of gravitational wave from astronomical objects but also a binary black hole system with a several tens of solar masses @xcite .",
    "based solely on the gravitational - wave signals recorded by two ligo detectors , the current hypothesis is that gw 150914 was the result of a merger of two black holes with initial masses of @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the luminosity distance of @xmath13 mpc .",
    "the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( fermi - gbm ) reported a possible weak gamma - ray transient source above 50 kev at 0.4 s after the gw 150914 trigger @xcite .",
    "however , the deeper upper limit provided by the _",
    "integral _ acs instrument in a gamma - ray energy band similar to the _ fermi_-gbm energy band is not consistent with a possible gamma - ray counterpart of gw 150914 suggested by the _ fermi_-gbm @xcite .",
    "no electromagnetic counterpart of gw 150914 was found in radio , optical , near - infrared , x - ray and high - energy gamma - ray @xcite .",
    "gw 151226 ( ligo - virgo trigger i d : g211117 ) is the 2nd gravitational - wave candidate identified by both ligo hanford observatory and ligo livingston observatory with a high significance ( the false alarm rate of less than one per 1000 years by the on - line search ) at 3:38:53.647 ut on december 26 , 2015 @xcite .",
    "according to a bayesian parameter estimation analysis , the event is very likely a binary black hole merger with initial black hole masses of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and final black hole mass of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the luminosity distance of the source is estimated as @xmath17 mpc which corresponds to a redshift of @xmath18 .",
    "as far as the electromagnetic counterpart search of gw 151226 in the gamma - ray regime is concerned , _",
    "fermi_-gbm @xcite , _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite , high - altitude water cherenkov observatory ( hawc ) @xcite , and _",
    "@xcite reported no detections around the gw trigger time .",
    "the calorimetric electron telescope ( _ calet _ ; @xcite ) mission , which was successfully launched and emplaced on the japanese experiment module - exposed facility ( jem - ef ) of the international space station ( iss ) in august 2015 , was fully operational at the time of gw 151226 . _",
    "calet _ consists of two scientific instruments .",
    "the calorimeter ( cal ) is the main instrument which is capable of observing high energy electrons from @xmath01 gev to @xmath020 tev , protons , helium and heavy nuclei from @xmath010 gev to 1000 tev , and gamma - rays from @xmath01 gev to @xmath010 tev .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of cal is @xmath0@xmath19 from the zenith direction .",
    "another instrument , _ calet _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( cgbm ; @xcite ) , is a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) monitor using two different kind of scintillators ( labr@xmath20(ce ) and bgo ) to achieve a broad energy coverage .",
    "the hard x - ray monitor ( hxm ) using labr@xmath20(ce ) covers the energy range from 7 kev up to 1 mev , and two identical modules are equipped in the same direction in _",
    "calet_. the soft gamma - ray monitor ( sgm ) based on bgo covers the energy range from 40 kev to 20 mev .",
    "the fov of hxm and sgm are @xmath0@xmath21 and @xmath0@xmath22 from the boresight respectively .",
    "the cgbm has been detecting grbs at an average rate of 3 - 4 events per month .    around the trigger time of gw 151226 , _ calet",
    "_ was performing regular scientific data collection . between 3:30 and 3:43 ut ,",
    "the cal was operating in the low - energy gamma - ray mode , which is an operation mode with a lower energy threshold of 1 gev .",
    "the high voltages of cgbm were set at the nominal values around 3:20 ut and turned off around 3:40 ut to avoid high background radiation area .",
    "there was no cgbm on - board trigger at the trigger time of gw 151226 .",
    "at 3:38 ut , the cgbm was operating in nominal operational mode in which continuous light curve data in 0.125 s time resolution were recorded at eight different energy bands for each instrument .",
    "the boresight directions of hxm and sgm were ( r.a .",
    ", dec . ) ( j2000 ) = ( 35.6@xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and ( 43.5@xmath23 , @xmath25 ) at the onset of gw 151226 . around the gw 11226 event time , no cgbm on - board trigger occurred .",
    "therefore , the available data to investigate the possible counterpart are the continuous light curves mentioned above . if there is the on - board trigger , the time - tagged event data with 62.5 @xmath26s resolution will be generated .",
    "figure [ fig : cgbm_lc ] shows the light curves in the 0.125 s time bins in the time range between @xmath2710 s from the gw 151226 trigger time . as seen in the figure , no significant excess is seen in the cgbm data around the trigger time .",
    "we calculate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in sliding the time bins of the light curves by selecting the background interval as 8 s , 16 s , 32 s and 64 s and the foreground interval as 0.125 s , 0.25 s , 0.5 s , 1 s and 4 s. the snr is calculated as , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the counts in the foreground interval , @xmath30 is the integration time of the foreground interval , @xmath31 is the counts in the background interval and @xmath32 is the integration time of the background interval .",
    "the background interval is always prior to the foreground interval and there is no time gap between the background and the foreground interval .",
    "we search the light curve data for finding signals of individual instrument ( hxm1 , hxm2 and sgm ) and the sum of the hxm1 and the hxm2 .",
    "the searched energy bands are all the combinations of 7 - 10 kev , 10 - 25 kev , 25 - 50 kev , 50 - 100 kev for the high - gain data and 60 - 100 kev , 100 - 170 kev , 170 - 300 kev and 300 - 3000 kev for the low - gain data of the hxm . in the sgm ,",
    "40 - 100 kev , 100 - 230 kev , 230 - 450 kev and 450 - 1000 kev for the high - gain data and 560 - 840 kev , 840 - 1500 kev , 1.5 - 2.6 mev and 2.6 - 28 mev for the low - gain data are investigated .",
    "the highest snr between @xmath2710 s window is 4.7 at 7.5 s after the ligo trigger in the 7 - 10 kev band of the hxm1 ( the 1 s foreground and the 16 s background interval ) .",
    "using 38,900 trials the false - detection probability at the level of 4.7 @xmath5 was evaluated as @xmath00.02 which is too high to claim a detection . in the hxm2 data , the snr of the same time bin in which the highest snr is found in hxm1 data is @xmath33 .",
    "the highest snr is still found in the same time bin even if we extend the search window up to @xmath2760 s. therefore , we concluded that there are no significant signals in the cgbm data associated with the gravitational - wave event . note that , however , our search is limited by the available continuous light curve data in the 0.125 s time resolution and might not be sensitive to an event with duration shorter than 0.125 s.    the flux upper limits of hxm and sgm are evaluated by using a cgbm monte - carlo simulator based on the _ geant4 _ software package .",
    "the simulations are performed by emitting the photons at incident angles from 0@xmath23 to 110@xmath23 in 1@xmath23 steps with respect to the detector .",
    "the source spectrum assumes following three cases .",
    "the first case is a typical grb spectrum for the batse short grbs ( s - grbs ) . in this case",
    ", we use the averaged batse s - grb spectral parameters in a cutoff power - law model reported by @xcite , with a photon index of @xmath34 and @xmath35 = 355 kev .",
    "the second assumed spectrum corresponds to the possible grb candidate of gw 150914 reported by _",
    "the spectral model is a cutoff power - law model with a photon index of @xmath36 and @xmath35= 3.5 mev @xcite .",
    "the third case is the crab - like spectrum : a power - law with a photon index of @xmath37 .",
    "the background spectrum is estimated using the real data over three days around the event , normalized to the actual background level at the trigger time .",
    "the exposure time of the input and the background spectrum is one second .",
    "the source flux is evaluated to be in a range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "the energy ranges for calculating the upper limits are determined as the best energy band to detect typical batse s - grbs : 7 - 500 kev for hxm and 50 - 1000 kev for sgm .",
    "we also include the systematic uncertainties in the detector energy response function in the estimations of the upper limits of each detector .",
    "the sky maps of the 7 @xmath5 upper limit overlaid with the shadow of iss are shown in figure [ fig : cgbm_sen ] .",
    "the 7 @xmath5 threshold is the same setup parameter as the on - board trigger system .",
    "the upper limits assuming the typical batse s - grb spectrum for the hxm and the sgm are 1.0 @xmath40 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 7 - 500 kev ) at the incident angle of 30@xmath23 and 1.8 @xmath40 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 50 - 1000 kev ) at the incident angle of 45@xmath23 , respectively . if we assume the spectrum of _ fermi_-gbm candidate of gw 150914 , the 7 @xmath5 upper limits of the hxm and the sgm are 1.3 @xmath40 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 7 - 500 kev ) at 30@xmath23 off - axis and 3.0 @xmath40 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 50 - 1000 kev ) at 45@xmath23 off - axis . in the case of the crab - like spectrum ,",
    "the 7 @xmath5 upper limits of the hxm and the sgm are 5.1 @xmath41 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 7 - 500 kev ) at 30@xmath23 off - axis and 1.4 @xmath40 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 50 - 1000 kev ) at 45@xmath23 off - axis .",
    "our upper limits correspond to the k - corrected luminosity of @xmath42 erg s@xmath4 for hxm and @xmath43 erg s@xmath4 for sgm in the 1 kev - 10 mev band at the rest frame using the redshift of 0.09 and assuming a typical batse s - grb spectrum .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent luminosity of s - grbs is in the range from @xmath44 erg s@xmath4 to @xmath45 erg s@xmath4 with the mean of @xmath46 erg s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if s - grbs occur within 440 mpc , cgbm could detect a signal from a majority of s - grbs .",
    "the cgbm coverage of the ligo sky probability is estimated as follows .",
    "first , we define the sky region by adding the probability of each pixel of the ligo probability map ( lalinference_skymap_2.fits ) from the highest pixel until the summed probability reaches a 90% level . then , the pixel values inside the overlapping region between this 90% ligo probability map and the fov of cgbm are integrated to estimate the ligo summed probabilities .",
    "furthermore , the shadow due to the iss structure is taken into account for the estimation of sgm .",
    "the coverages of the summed ligo probability are estimated as 32.5% for hxm and 49.1% for sgm .",
    "a search for gamma - ray events associated with gw 151226 was carried out using the cal data in the time interval from @xmath47 s to @xmath48 s around the ligo trigger .",
    "the cal was operational in low - energy gamma - ray mode in which the energy threshold is 1 gev ( compared to 10 gev in high - energy mode ) in this time period .",
    "we apply a gamma - ray selection by tracking pair creation events in the imaging calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray event selection used in this analysis is basically the same as the one of @xcite although a stronger cut was applied by using more than two hits in each tracking layer .",
    "three or more hits in each tracking layer ensure a higher tracking quality in exchange for a reduction of 1 radiation - length in conversion materials ( tungsten ) usable for pair creation in the imaging calorimeter . the highest gamma - ray efficiency is achieved around 10 gev with an efficiency of 50% relative to a geometrical factor of 420 @xmath49 sr which is estimated by applying the geometrical acceptance condition on isotropically generated simulated events .",
    "the effective areas for incident angles of 0@xmath23 , 20@xmath23 and 30@xmath23 are 74 @xmath49 , 44 @xmath49 , and 17 @xmath49 at 1 gev , respectively .",
    "the effective areas are increasing with energy and reach around 10 gev their maxima of 260 @xmath49 , 180 @xmath49 and 80 @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "our long - term cal observation of galactic diffuse gamma - rays in the low - energy gamma - ray mode clearly identified a peak at the galactic equator on the count map as a function of the galactic latitude .",
    "this matches the expectation estimated based on a galactic diffuse radiation model @xcite when considering above mentioned effective areas and observation exposure . as a result",
    ", it was proven that the _ calet _ observation in low - energy gamma - ray mode has achieved detection of the galactic diffuse gamma - rays . since the searched location for the gw 151226 counterpart is significantly far from the galactic plane , the number of background gamma - rays is negligibly small , 0.0024 events according to the calculation based on the model of @xcite .",
    "another expected background might , however , result from misidentification of cosmic - ray events at lower energies .",
    "the number of such events in the time - window of the gw 151226 counterpart search is also estimated using the diffuse gamma - ray model in comparison with the observed data .",
    "a conservative upper limit of this background is obtained by the assumption that all of the excess in observed data to the model originates from the background .",
    "then , the possibility of such a misidentification is confirmed to be less than 0.035 events .",
    "therefore , the cal observation is virtually background free in such a short time window .",
    "we found no gamma - ray candidate inside this time window with negligible contamination from other events .",
    "the upper limit of the cal observation in this 736 s long period is estimated as follows .",
    "first , we calculated the effective area and the resultant exposure map in the time window for the 1 - 100 gev band . at lower energies",
    ", the effective area gradually decreases below 10 gev and reaches zero around 500 mev .",
    "next , we estimated the limiting flux corresponding to 2.44 events , which is the 90% confidence limit for null observation , assuming a single power - law model with a photon index of @xmath50 by applying the estimated exposure map .",
    "the assumed photon index of @xmath50 is a typical photon index of the _ fermi_-lat grbs in the gev energy range @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : cal_sen ] shows the sky map of the flux upper limit at 90% confidence level .",
    "the estimated 90% upper limit is @xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 in the 1 - 100 gev band where cal reaches 15% of the integrated ligo probability ( @xmath01.1 sr ) .",
    "the cal upper limit in luminosity is estimated as @xmath51 erg s@xmath4 for a source distance of 440 mpc .",
