    "the integrated light of elliptical galaxies contains many clues to their star formation histories .",
    "currently , the most popular approach to deciphering the broad band colors and spectral features of elliptical galaxies and star clusters is evolutionary population synthesis ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ; bressan , chiosi , & fagotto 1994 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "this technique models the integrated light for a stellar population of a given age and metallicity by summing up the light from individual stars along theoretical isochrones .",
    "the resulting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is dependent on the libraries of stellar evolutionary tracks and stellar fluxes , the chosen star formation rate and initial mass function ( imf ) , and in the case of multi - metallicity populations , the chemical enrichment history .",
    "charlot , worthey , & bressan ( 1996 ) examined the differences between several recent models and found that they are seriously limited by the dearth of reliable libraries for cool and non - solar composition stars and by the uncertain properties of post main sequence stars .",
    "nevertheless , population synthesis is appealing because of its ability to prescribe a fundamental recipe for a galaxy .",
    "attempts to unravel the history of star formation in elliptical galaxies via spectral synthesis are plagued by the `` age - metallicity degeneracy '' ( worthey 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "the effective temperature of the red giant branch ( rgb ) decreases with increasing age and metallicity in such a way that the rgb of an old solar metallicity population looks nearly identical to that of a more metal - rich , slightly younger population . because the rgb dominates both the integrated line strength and broad band color longward of 4000  , a degeneracy of these properties in age and abundance results for stellar populations older than 1 gyr .",
    "the most promising attempts to disentangle age and metallicity from integrated spectra have involved use of the balmer absorption lines @xcite and mid - uv colors ( dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 ) .",
    "all of these methods rely on spectral diagnostics for which the main sequence begins to dominate over the rgb .",
    "the contribution of the main sequence turn - off to the integrated light is greatest in the mid - uv region ( @xmath5 2500 - 3500  ) ; the contribution of the far - uv bright hb and post hb stars to the integrated light is less than 50% at 2500  ( worthey , dorman , & jones 1996 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the spectral break at 2900  is correlated with spectral type of the turn - off population but weakly influenced by metallicity . also , the continuum of mid - uv is affected by the metallicity of the stellar population . @xcite",
    "found that the color ( 2500-v ) was correlated with metallicity and fanelli et al .",
    "( 1990 , 1992 ) found @xmath6 ( 2600-v ) 10 times more sensitive to [ fe / h ] than @xmath6 ( b - v ) . because the spectral type of the main sequence turn - off stars dominates the absorption features of the mid - uv and the continuum is highly sensitive to chemical content , a detailed investigation of the integrated mid - uv light of stellar populations may help break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "one observational result population synthesis models have sought to explain is the correlation between the `` uv upturn '' shortward of 2000  and the optical mg@xmath0 absorption line strength in elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the brightest galaxies in uv also have the strongest mg@xmath0 absorption ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 ) , suggesting that these uv strong galaxies are metal - rich and possibly enhanced in @xmath7 element abundances . in the most metal - rich galaxies , the primary source of far - uv emission appears to be extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars and their descendants , the agb - manqu  stars . while the bulk of the evidence favors a metal - rich origin for the ehb stars @xcite , models with a distribution of metallicities including a metal - poor tail @xcite can not be excluded . in any case , the models for hot populations are strongly dependent on mass loss on the red giant branch and on the helium abundance .",
    "small changes in these two parameters can give wildly different uv upturns at fixed age and metallicity .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , the uv upturn is simply an underlying continuum that must be subtracted from the galaxy spectra prior to analysis of the spectral features .",
    "the star formation history of nearby ellipticals , particularly m32 , has been in the subject of much debate . in 1980",
    ", @xcite proposed that a 5 gyr stellar sub - population is responsible for the relatively blue @xmath8 color of m32 .",
    "the idea that m32 contains a large intermediate age population was supported by detailed comparison of m32 and 47 tuc ( an old `` metal - rich '' globular cluster ) near uv spectra ( 3800 - 4400  ) @xcite .",
    "the study of h@xmath9 and h@xmath10 absorption lines , which are dependent on the main sequence turn - off stars in old stellar populations , suggest intermediate ages for many ellipticals @xcite .",
    "however , recent hst observations of m32 s red giant branch implies that at least half of m32 s stars are older than 8 gyr @xcite . the metallicity distribution of m32 and other ellipticals has also been investigated .",
    "@xcite found evidence for a hot metal - poor population in an otherwise metal - rich population in the mid - uv spectra of m32 .",
    "the width of m32 s rgb requires that the stars span a substantial range in metallicity @xcite .",
    "the estimated metallicity distribution has a low metallicity tail extending down to [ fe / h ] = -1.5 but is strongly skewed to solar metallicity and is much narrower than expected from a closed box chemical enrichment scenario .",
    "comparisons to synthetic spectra suggest that other galaxies , including ngc 1404 , ngc 4649 , and the bulge of m31 , also show a deficit of low metallicity stars relative to closed box models @xcite .",
    "the ages of distant elliptical galaxies has been the subject of some debate as well .",
    "@xcite determined an age of @xmath5 3.5 gyr ( assuming a solar metallicity ) for lbds 53w091 ( z @xmath5 1.55 ) by comparing the rest frame mid - uv spectral features to solar metallicity f and g stars and population synthesis models .",
    "a galaxy this old at a redshift of 1.55 would rule out a @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 universe .",
    "a later comparison of this galaxy s spectra to improved f star models gave an age of 1 - 2 gyr ( assuming z @xmath14 @xmath15 ) , relaxing the cosmological constraints ( heap et al .",
    "because galaxies with 0.5 @xmath2 z @xmath2 1.5 have their mid - uv spectra redshifted into the visible range , a better understanding of the mid - uv features of old stellar populations will be useful for dating distant galaxies .    using simple population synthesis models , we examine the mid - uv features and mg@xmath0 strengths of four nearby elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges . in order to study the spectral properties of the underlying main sequence and",
    "rgb branch stars , we exclude the uncertain hot hb and post hb stars from our models isochrones and attempt to subtract out the far - uv component from the galaxies spectra .",
    "specifically we use the blend feature at 2538  ( bl2538 ) and mg@xmath0 line indices and introduce a new tool for examining the mid - uv continua , the slope between 2600 and 3100  ( @xmath4 ) , to determine the galactic properties .",
    "the investigation of the mid - uv dependence on age and abundance via population synthesis is severely limited by inaccuracies in our model stellar fluxes .",
    "however , bl2538 and @xmath4 appear to be adequately modeled by the kurucz fluxes .",
    "we find for our simple population models that populations older than 3 gyr separate out in the s2850 v. bl2538 and s2850 v. mg@xmath0 planes .",
    "although globular cluster spectra agree with simple , single metallicity , single age populations , a small but mid - uv bright component of low metallicity ( z @xmath2 0.001 ) stars may explain the spectral features of ngc 1399 .",
    "m32 s uv features can not be explained purely by a significant population of intermediate age ( 1 - 3 gyr ) solar metallicity stars ; a small number of metal - poor stars are suggested by the mid - uv in this case as well .",
    "because metal - poor stars are so much brighter than metal - rich stars in the mid - uv , we can not ignore the effects of the metallicity distribution on our population synthesis models .    the rest of the paper is arranged as follows : first , in section 2 we test our library of stellar fluxes ( lejeune , cuisnier , & buser 1997 ) for inaccuracies and determine the influence of these inaccuracies on our model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . in section 3 , we explain our population synthesis models , their mid - uv and optical properties , and compare them to the mid - uv features of several composite globular cluster iue spectra ( bonatto , bica , & alloin 1995 ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we present the fos spectra of ngc 1399 and ngc 3610 and the iue spectra of ngc 1399 , m32 and the bulge of m31 .",
    "we compare our models to these galaxies . in section 5",
    "we examine the effects of a metal - poor sub - population on the integrated spectra of an otherwise metal - rich population .",
    "in order to examine the effect of abundance on the integrated light of old stellar populations , kurucz model stellar fluxes @xcite with [ fe / h ] = -1.5 , -1.0 , -0.5 , 0.0 , and + 0.5 were used for our population synthesis models . due to the paucity of non - solar abundance stars in empirical libraries , the kurucz models offer the advantage of the studying the effects of a full range of metallicity on the model stellar populations . however , at cooler temperatures the model fluxes do suffer from serious limitations .",
    "@xcite compared late g and k solar chemical composition giants and found that , while the optical and infrared observations matched the kurucz fluxes , significant discrepancies existed in the uv .",
    "they concluded that the models failed to account for chromospheric emission and thus underestimated the flux at wavelengths less than 3100  .",
    "also , the optical mg@xmath0 index of cool , metal - rich giants may not be well modeled by the kurucz stellar fluxes . when the kurucz 1992 models were compared to the improved kurucz 1993 models , chavez , malgnini , & morossi ( 1995 ) found that for @xmath16 @xmath2 5000k and [ fe / h ] @xmath14 0.0 , the newer models predicted a mg@xmath0 values up to 0.58 magnitudes stronger than the 1992 models .",
    "the kurucz 1993 fluxes corrected an error in the fei continuum opacity for cool stars , had more optical depth points , and included detailed modeling of scattering effects in the source function not accounted for in the 1992 fluxes .",
    "clearly , while the kurucz models are powerful tools for the modeling of stellar populations , a detailed understanding of their limitations is necessary to interpret the results of our model stellar populations correctly .",
    "here we quantify the accuracy of the kurucz model stellar fluxes in the mid - uv and the optical .",
    "we test the mid - uv spectra and optical features mg@xmath0 and h@xmath9 of the solar abundance kurucz 1992 models against the composite iue stellar main sequence spectral energy distributions complied by @xcite and standard stars in the @xcite catalog .",
    "the importance of the cool giants on the mid - uv and optical portions of our model seds is determined .",
    "we have used the un - calibrated kurucz model fluxes presented by @xcite as our stellar library .",
    "lejeune et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have calculated correction functions for each of the kurucz models in order to yield synthetic broad - band colors which match the empirical color - temperature relations .",
    "however , they note that the dwarf stellar fluxes have a negligible optical color correction for @xmath16 @xmath14 3500 k , and that the color correction is significant for the giants only for @xmath16 @xmath2 4000 k. because we use the non - color corrected fluxes , we first tested the un - calibrated solar metallicity model colors against the colors of the stars in the gunn - stryker catalog @xcite .",
    "the broad band colors u - b and b - v of the kurucz fluxes match both the giant and dwarf stars in the gunn - stryker catalog to within @xmath18 0.2 magnitudes ( figure 1a & b ) .",
    "the coolest red giant colors are least well fit by the kurucz fluxes , with a discrepancy of @xmath5 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "fanelli et al .",
    "( 1990 , 1992 ) examined the mid - uv spectral morphology of 218 normal stars observed by iue and found that the spectral lines in the uv are sensitive to and change significantly with spectral types ranging from o to k. we measured the spectral indices fe2402 , bl2538 , fe2609 , mg2800 , mg2852 , mgwide , and fe3000 as defined by @xcite ( table 1 and figure 2 ) for the kurucz model fluxes corresponding to solar , main - sequence ( ms ) stars and compared them to the indices of the iue stellar spectra measured by @xcite . unfortunately , few non - solar metallicity stars were observed , and so our discussion is limited to the comparison of solar abundance stars and the corresponding kurucz models .",
    "it is important to note that the `` continuum '' band passes for these indices contain very little true continuum . due to the strong line blanketing in the uv",
    ", we are forced to use pseudo - continuum band passes around the absorption features to compute indices and our results will depend on the accuracy of the pseudo - continuum as well as that of the absorption features of the stellar models .    in figure 3a - g",
    ", we plot the b - v color against the mid - uv line indices for both the iue composite spectra ( triangles ) and kurucz fluxes ( connected crosses ) .",
    "the b - v colors for the kurucz models were measured using iraf task synphot.calcphot .",
    "only the bl2538 feature is well matched ( to better than 0.05 magnitudes ) by the full temperature range of kurucz main sequence model fluxes ( figure 3b ) .",
    "( when the individual iue spectra are compared to the kurucz fluxes , the stellar bl2538 values show a great deal of scatter about the kurucz values ( dorman , oconnell , & rood 1997 )",
    ". this may be due to noise in the individual iue spectra or metallicity and gravity variations .",
    "the difference in bl2538 between a g0v and g0iii star is @xmath5 0.4 magnitudes ; the difference between a g0v and g0iv star is much less , @xmath5 0.03 magnitudes . we examine the composite iue spectra of stars identified as luminosity class v because these stars will dominate the mid - uv light . ) in general , the kurucz model fluxes for b - v @xmath2 0.1 ( @xmath16 @xmath14 8000 k ) match the observed line strengths of iue data , but overestimate the line strengths for cooler stars ( b - v @xmath14 0.2 , @xmath16 @xmath2 7000 k ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath16 = 6000 k , log g=4.5 solar kurucz model is too strong by 0.6 magnitudes for fe2404 , 0.4 for fe2609 , 0.4 for mg2800 , 0.4 for mg2852 , 0.3 for mgwide , and 0.15 too weak for fe3000 .",
    "these discrepancies may be due in part to the inevitably incomplete atomic line lists .",
    "they may also be the result of departures from lte , chromospheric emission filling in the mid - uv absorption lines for cooler dwarfs , and opacity due to tri - atomic molecules , none of which are modeled by the kurucz stellar fluxes .",
    "the continuum of the mid - uv range is strongly sensitive to the metallicity of the stellar population @xcite age may also influence the mid - uv continuum : the spectrum of an old stellar population at 2500  is dominated by flux from main sequence turn - off stars , and thus may be used to constrain this turn - off population more closely than the k and m giant dominated optical region of the spectrum .",
    "again , it is important to realize that the vast number of atomic absorption lines in the uv suppress most of the true continuum and what we observe is a pseudo - continuum .    to examine the dependence of this region s pseudo - continuum on age and metallicity , we have measured the slope of the pseudo - continuum ( @xmath19 magnitude/1000  ) in the 2600 to 3100  range of our model simple populations ( section 3 ) .",
    "the slope of the pseudo - continuum between 2600 and 3100 ( hereafter @xmath4 ) was estimated using the iraf v2.11.1 task onedspec.continuum with high rejection set at 3 @xmath20 and low rejection set at 1 @xmath20 in order to exclude the effects of the magnesium features at 2800 and 2852  on the spectral shape .",
    "again , to determine possible inaccuracies in the model fluxes , we tested @xmath4 of the kurucz models against @xmath4 of the iue observations .",
    "in figure 3h , the @xmath4 for the main sequence iue spectra and kurucz models are plotted against @xmath8 for the range of slopes observed in the galaxies .",
    "the kurucz models pseudo - continua closely match that of the observations ( to better than 0.5 @xmath19 magnitude/ 1000  ) , except for the coolest stars ( @xmath21 1.1 ) .",
    "( note : the color - corrected lejeune et al .",
    "1997 version of the stellar models do not reproduce s2850 ; the shifts in b - v are small but the s2850 feature is shallower by up to 2 mag/ 1000  . )",
    "we also examine the robustness of the kurucz models line strengths at optical wavelengths for solar metallicity giants .",
    "the mg@xmath0 feature is primarily a measurement of the galaxy s metallicity , but is also strongly linked to age .",
    "the h@xmath9 feature at 4860  is sensitive to main sequence turn - off temperature , and hence may be an indicator of age @xcite .",
    "observed elliptical galaxy h@xmath9 and h@xmath10 absorption strengths suggest intermediate ages ( @xmath2 8 gyr ) .",
    "we seek to determine the relationship between the mid - uv properties and these optical line strengths for elliptical galaxies ( section 4 ) .    in figure 4a - d ,",
    "we compared the mg@xmath0 and h@xmath9 features of the kurucz solar ms dwarfs and giants models to a number of standard ms dwarfs and giants taken from the gunn - stryker atlas .",
    "the kurucz models have an h@xmath9 equivalent width @xmath5 1 - 2  less than the standard stars , so we do not use this optical feature for our analysis .",
    "although mg@xmath0 is well modeled by the kurucz models with @xmath16 @xmath14 4500 k , cooler giants increasingly overestimate the feature by 0.2 magnitudes or more ( figure 4a ) .",
    "the coolest dwarf models also overestimate mg@xmath0 strength . given",
    "that @xcite found that the cool metal - rich giant kurucz models mg@xmath0 values were strongly sensitive to small changes in the scattering parameter , we will also not use the mg@xmath0 values estimated by the kurucz models .",
    "instead we use the empirical fitting formula given by @xcite ( the dashed line in figure 4a , b ) . @xcite",
    "determined the dependence of @xmath5 eighty stars mg@xmath0 on effective temperature , gravity , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / h ] .",
    "our model seds were created using the technique of `` isochrone synthesis '' , whereby a stellar population is created by summing up stellar fluxes along isochrones for a given age and metallicity ; in section 3 we describe this process in greater detail . comparing the isochrones of different ages and metallicity @xcite",
    ", we see that old , metal - rich populations possess a significant number of k and m giants .",
    "since the kurucz stellar fluxes poorly model these stars in the uv , we examined the importance of the cool giants to the total integrated light of our oldest , most metal - rich ( 20 gyr , z=0.05 ) model population .",
    "we have removed the contribution from giant stars with @xmath16 @xmath2 4500 k from a 20 gyr , z=0.05 sed and compared it to the un - modified sed ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we see that the giants contribute very little light to the mid - uv ( 1800 - 3200  ) , and become significant for wavelengths @xmath14 4000  .",
    "thus we are confident that the mid - uv continuum of our synthetic populations is not significantly affected by the known inaccuracies of cool giants .    in summary , after close investigation of the mid - uv and optical line strengths of the main sequence and giant solar metallicity kurucz models , we are left with only the blend feature of fei and mgi at 2538  in the mid - uv ( @xmath22 ) and the slope of the continua between 2600 and 3100  ( @xmath4 ) as features reproduced well by the kurucz models .",
    "we are satisfied that the mid - uv is not significantly influenced by the discrepancies in the cool giant stellar models . however ,",
    "if further detailed investigation of the narrow band absorption features in the mid - uv is to be done , new model stellar fluxes with more accurate mid - uv and optical line strengths need to be constructed .",
    "it is important to note that our tests of the bl2538 and @xmath4 features have only shown that the relative fluxes of the pseudo - continuum over small wavelength regions are reasonably matched by the kurucz models . for bl2538",
    ", we have only examined the relative flux of the local pseudo - continuum to the blend absorbtion feature , and for @xmath4 , we have tested the average slope of the pseudo - continuum over a 500   range .",
    "a 10 % error in the mid - uv pseudo - continuum would introduce a 0.1 magnitude error in bl2538 and a 0.2 magnitude/ 1000   error in @xmath4 .",
    "problems with the mid - uv pseudo - continuum over larger wavelength regions and its normalization relative to the optical pseudo - continuum may still exist .",
    "single metallicity , single age simple stellar populations were constructed using the `` isochrone synthesis '' technique , which sums up model stellar fluxes using a given set of isochrones , imf and star formation rate .",
    "we used kurucz model fluxes for stars with 3500 k @xmath2 @xmath16 @xmath2 40000 k , the padova isochrones @xcite , a salpeter imf , and an exponentially decaying star formation rate with @xmath23 = @xmath24 .",
    "spectral energy distributions were created for z=0.0004 , 0.001 , 0.008 , 0.02 , and 0.05 and ages 3 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 15 , and 20 gyrs .",
    "further details of the isochrone synthesis code are given in @xcite .",
    "the padova isochrones only contain `` normal '' p - agb stars and do not model post - early agb ( pe - agb ) , agb - manqu  or `` extreme blue horizontal branch '' stars ( hb stars with zahb @xmath16 @xmath14 16,000",
    "k ) which are all possible contributors to the uv upturn found in elliptical galaxies @xcite . while the existence of ehb stars and their descendents in elliptical galaxies is reasonably secure observationally , theoretical models of how the ehb is populated are uncertain .",
    "the number of ehb stars depends on parameters such as the metallicity , age , helium abundance of the stellar population , and on the details of mass loss at the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "while it is possible to choose plausible values for these parameters and construct synthetic spectra , the dependence on the poorly constrained rgb mass loss rate means that the uv upturn is not yet useful for constraining the age and chemical content of the stellar population .    for galaxies with a strong uv upturn ,",
    "the mid - uv portion of the spectrum contains flux both from ehb stars ( @xmath16 @xmath5 25,000 k ) and from cooler hb and ms turn - off stars .",
    "because we are interested in the ms turn - off stars , we have chosen to subtract the hot stellar component from both the models and the data ( section 4 ) .",

    "note the difference between the the `` blue '' z=0.0007 cluster and the `` red '' z=0.0006 cluster in bl2538 .",
    "again , this may be the result of the blue component of stars washing out the bl2538 feature .",
    "the effects of interstellar extinction on the @xmath4 and bl2538 were found to be less than the uncertainty of the model seds and galaxy data .",
    "galactic extinction curves with a@xmath30 = 0.0 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.25 , 0.50 , and 0.75 @xcite were used to redden the seds of solar metallicity models of ages 1 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 15 , and 20 gyr and the seds of a 7 gyr population with z= 0.0004 , 0.001 , 0.008 , 0.02 , and 0.05 . in all cases , @xmath19 bl2538 @xmath2 0.05 magnitudes . for a@xmath30 @xmath2 0.50 ,",

    "ngc 1399 and ngc 3610 were observed with the hst faint object spectrograph on 1993 17 january and 1992 30 november , respectively ( figure 11 ) .",
    "gratings and exposure times are shown in table 3 .",
    "all observations used a 1.0  diameter circular aperture .",
    "the observations were with the aberrated hst optics , prior to installation of costar . in this paper",
    "we focus on the g270h data .",
    "the target acquisition procedure involved measuring the flux a 4x4 grid for spaced at 0.25 `` intervals , and choosing the brightest spot in the grid .",
    "this procedure thus centered the galaxy to an accuracy of 0.25 '' in the aperture , and also resulted in the observations with the red channel and the blue channel being slightly offset from each other ( in retrospect a 5x5 grid would have been better ) .",
    "the fos data were reduced following standard pipeline procedures .",
    "this involves correcting for geomagnetic - induced image motion ; correcting for particle - induced dark current based on the geomagnetic position of the spacecraft ; correcting for scattered light via subtraction of a constant count - rate determined from diodes that are unilluminated by the selected grating ; flat - field correction ; wavelength calibration ; and flux calibration based on observations spectrophotometric standards .",
    "a full correction for grating - scattered light is in principle much more complex than the simple subtraction of a constant we have adopted here ( bushouse , rosa , & mueller 1995 ) . in particular , due to the high sensitivity of the fos detectors to long - wavelength photons ,",
    "the fos spectra contain a component of light scattered from wavelengths longward of 3000  .",
    "we have used bspec @xcite to estimate the uncertainty introduced by ignoring the wavelength dependence of the scattered light correction .",
    "for ngc1399 we use a composite spectrum constructed from the the hut spectrum , the iue spectrum of ngc4649 , and an optical spectrum from the las campanas observatory ( kimble , davidsen , & sandage 1989 ) , normalized to agree in the wavelength regions where they overlap .",
    "for this model , the average scattered light contribution to the measured flux from 1700 - 3270  is less than 1% .",
    "we have obtained uv spectra for ngc 1399 , m32 and the bulge of m31 , extracted from the iue database by d. calzetti ( figure 11 ) .",
    "all the spectra have been corrected for redshift obtained from ned using the iraf v 2.11.1 task onedspec.dopcor .",
    "literature values for mg@xmath0 ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 ; worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ) may overestimate the galaxy s",
    "mean mg@xmath0 index strength because the spectra are often taken with a narrow aperture centered on the inner - most ( and probably most metal - rich ) regions of the galaxy .",
    "we measure the mg@xmath0 values from the optical spectra of @xcite which were taken with an aperture matched to the 10  @xmath31 20  iue aperture . for ngc 1399",
    ", 20  corresponds to @xmath5 2 kpc .",
    "however , for m 31 and m 32 , 20  corresponds to @xmath5 80 pc , so for these galaxies even with the wide aperture slit we are observing only the very central regions .    in the case of ngc 3610 ,",
    "wide aperture optical spectra were not available and the mg@xmath0 value taken with the lick 1.4@xmath31 4  aperture @xcite was compared to our models .",
    "if we assume ngc 3610 has a metallicity gradient typical of other elliptical galaxies @xcite , no appreciable age gradient , and an age @xmath5 10 gyr , at a 10  radius , ngc 3610 should have a slope 0.5 magnitudes/1000   less steep , bl2538 0.05 magnitudes weaker , and an mg@xmath0 0.05 magnitudes weaker than measured in a 1  aperture .",
    "our goal is to examine the main sequence and cooler stellar sub - population of these galaxies , and not the hot horizontal and post hb populations .",
    "we must therefore determine which galaxies possess significant uv upturns and attempt to subtract away this hot component of the spectra .",
    "we estimated the strength of the uv upturn by measuring the @xmath32 color of the galaxies with the iraf task onedspec.sband .",
    "the 1550 and 2500 bands were centered at 1550 and 2500  respectively and were both 600  wide .",
    "our calculations of @xmath32 agreed with previously published values for the galaxies .",
    "m32 had the reddest @xmath32 color ( @xmath5 1.5 ) .",
    "the rest of the galaxies have significant uv upturns indicative of a hot stellar population . @xcite found that the far - uv flux of m31 shows a drop - off blue - ward at 1000  , which requires that the @xmath16 be @xmath5 25,000 k for the uv emitting stars .",
    "thus , for the `` normal '' galaxies with no recent star formation , the uv upturn can be roughly approximated by a @xmath16 @xmath5 20000 - 30000 k star .",
    "between 1350 and 3200  , the spectral shape changes very little with temperature for stars hotter than 20,000 k. for the galaxies with 1550 - 2500 colors @xmath2 0.5 magnitudes , we fit a 20,000k log g=5 kurucz model to the galaxies flux between 1350 and 1650  and subtracted the stellar spectrum from the galaxies spectra ( figure 12 ) . to test whether this method did a good job of eliminating the light from the hot component , models of a simple single metallicity population where created using the original isochrones with hot hb and p - agb stars .",
    "then the 20,000 k stellar model was fit and subtracted from this model sed .",
    "the resulting spectra had an identical slope and bl2538 strength as the model created using the modified isochrones ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "thus if a galaxy s uv upturn is due to a @xmath5 20,000 k hot stellar component , the subtracted galaxy spectra should have @xmath4 and bl2538 which reflect the metallicity and ages of the cooler stars .",
    "if a significant population of `` blue stragglers '' with @xmath33 exists , the resulting spectra will still have contamination from this non - msto population .",
    "however , like the hot hb and post hb population , the blue straggler population in galaxies is not well constrained .",
    "spinrad et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimate that if elliptical galaxies have blue straggler populations similar to that of old metal - poor clusters , blue stragglers may contribute as much as 20 - 50 % of flux at 2600  . on the other hand , for the higher metallicity cluster 47 tuc , the blue straggler contribution to the mid - uv flux has been estimated to be 7% @xcite .",
    "figures 7 - 9 show the measured spectral indices for the four galaxies in our sample .",
    "while the sample is small and the error bars are large , there are at least hints of some general trends . in particular , as mg@xmath27 increases , the @xmath22 feature tends to get weaker and the slope @xmath4 tends to get shallower .",
    "this is clearly evident in the comparison of ngc 1399 ( mg@xmath27 = 0.312 ) and ngc 3610 ( mg@xmath27 = 0.271 ) in figure 11 .",
    "it is also clear in figure 7 - 9 that the galaxies do not follow the behavior expected for simple stellar populations .",
    "the galaxies are generally displaced from the model locus and the trends are nearly orthogonal to those expected for simple variations of age and metallicity .",
    "our understanding of chemical evolution dictates that galaxies , unlike star clusters , have complex chemical make - ups , and so the comparison of single metallicity seds to real galaxies is limited in its usefulness . color and mg@xmath0 line strength gradients with galactic radius @xcite and the width of the rgb in m32 @xcite are evidence of stellar populations of varying metallicities within ellipticals .",
    "however , the details of the metallicity distribution in ellipticals are not well understood . comparing the mg@xmath0 and fe line strengths for synthetic populations and observed galaxies",
    ", @xcite finds high average metallicities , small metallicity dispersions and old ages for ellipticals .",
    "@xcite find that for m31 and m32 and @xcite find that for ngc1404 and ngc4649 only @xmath2 10% by mass of stars are metal poor ( z @xmath2 0.008 ) , which suggests that the ` g dwarf problem ' is not limited to the disk of the galaxy .",
    "because simple , single abundance seds did not match the mid - uv features of the majority of the galaxies in our sample , we looked to see how a spread in metallicities affects the light of a single stellar population .",
    "we consider a very simple bi - modal metallicity scenario for old stellar populations .",
    "two different bi - modal metallicity models are created by combining the spectra of the metal - poor z=0.0004 12 gyr population with the metal - rich spectra z=0.05 or z=0.02 12 gyr populations .",
    "the models are constructed so that 0.5% , 1% , 5% , 10% , and 15% of the total galaxy mass originates from the metal - poor z=0.0004 sub - population .",
    "these bi - modal metallicity models are then measured for bl2538 , mg@xmath0 , and @xmath4 .",
    "figure 13 shows the combined 10% z=0.0004 mass and 90% z=0.05 mass 12 gyr model ( solid line ) and each of its sub - population seds ( short dashed line for z=0.0004 , long dashed line for z=0.05 ) .",
    "while the metal - rich component dominates the visible light , the metal - poor component dominates the mid - uv .",
    "( table 5 )    in figures 14a , b , c we show the single metallicity models for a given age and the results of the bi - modal metallicity populations .",
    "the z=0.05 / z=0.0004 models are represented by the pentagons where the model with the highest slope and smallest pentagon has 0.5% of its mass from the metal - poor sub - population and the model with the lowest slope and largest pentagon has 15 % of its mass from the metal - poor sub - population .",
    "the z=0.02 / z=0.0004 models are represented by stars , again with the smallest star representing the 0.5% metal - poor mass model and the largest star representing the 15% metal - poor mass model .",
    "comparing the bi - modal models with the galaxies , we see that the positions of most of the galaxies in the @xmath4 v. bl2538 plane may be explained by a significant contribution of a metal - poor stellar population to the flux at 2600  ( figure 14a ) . on the other hand , contamination by `` blue stragglers '' or problems with the hot component subtraction may also result in weaker mid - uv features .",
    "but it is important to note that a small percentage of metal - poor stars can contribute most of the light at 2600  . while our results do not predict the number of low metallicity stars needed to `` solve '' the g - dwarf problem , it is not unreasonable to expect a few low metallicity stars in ellipticals",
    "however , except for ngc 1399 , for which the bi - modal metallicity tracks fit particularly well in all three planes , the mg@xmath0 strengths are slightly too strong to agree with most of the galaxies .",
    "the combination of bl2538 , @xmath4 , and mg@xmath0 provides a unique tool for investigating elliptical galaxy evolution .",
    "the uv features are most responsive to changes in the effective temperature of the turn - off population , while mg@xmath27 to first order measures the effective temperature of the giant branch .",
    "the positions of the galaxies in the line - strength vs. line - strength diagrams suggest : ( a ) these galaxies are not well represented by simple ( single - age , single - metallicity ) populations , and ( b ) that the star - formation and chemical enrichment histories were unique and complex .",
    "the addition of a small metal - poor component to a dominant old , metal - rich component helps to reconcile the models to the data .",
    "part of the difficulty in understanding the observations probably stems from the heterogeneous nature of the sample of galaxies in our sample , which to a certain extent represent the extremes of phenomena seen in elliptical galaxies , rather than the norm .",
    "it is thus worth considering each galaxy in turn , and examining the uv results in the context of other information about the galaxy .",
    "_ m32 : _ m 32 , a compact e1 satellite of m 31 , is the closest example of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "m 32 is unusual in that it has a very weak mg@xmath0 feature and no uv upturn .",
    "the stellar population in this galaxy has been the subject of intense study , both via integrated light and via the resolved stellar population . based on its blue ( b - v ) color , and on spectral synthesis ,",
    "@xcite has suggested that it contains a @xmath5 5 gyr subpopulation .",
    "the population synthesis study of @xcite found that m 32 spectrum is dominated by a 13 - 15 gyr , z @xmath2 @xmath15 population , and has evidence for an additional 5 gyr stellar population .",
    "the mid - uv region of m 32 s spectrum is not well fit by the closed box enrichment model and is more closely matched when the contribution from z @xmath2 0.008 stars is removed . in @xcite and later in @xcite , the infall of gas is suggested as a mechanism for increasing the galaxy s metallicity quickly and preventing the formation of a significant number of metal - poor stars .",
    "hst photometry a few arcminutes from the m 32 s nucleus @xcite seems to have confirmed the dominance of old solar metallicity stars and the deficiency of metal - poor stars .",
    "the observed width of the red giant branch requires that at least half of the stars in m 32 be older than 8 gyr .",
    "grillmair et al.s study also requires that the stars span a wide metallicity range but are strongly skewed to solar abundances .",
    "based on the comparison of iue mid - uv observations of m 32 s nucleus with the globular cluster 47 tuc , @xcite found the mid - uv spectrum of m 32 was best fit by a combination of a solar metallicity msto , a solar giant branch , and a hot a star component consisting of metal - poor stars and possibly some p - agb stars .",
    "the mid - uv spectral breaks 2609/2660 and 2828/2923 and absorption features mg2800 and mg2852 are weaker in m 32 than in 47 tuc , but the c26 - 30 color ( similar to our @xmath4 ) is redder in m 32 . while rose & deng ( 1999 ) were able to reproduce the spectral breaks and absorption lines with a solar msto population with a @xmath5 25 % metal - poor contribution of the mid - uv light , the simulated c26 - 30 color was @xmath5 0.1 magnitude bluer than m 32 .",
    "since this color is dominated by the msto whereas the other features are influenced more by the hotter population , a slightly higher metallicity msto may reconcile the simulation with m 32 .    from the simple single age , single metallicity seds ( figures 7 - 9 ) , we see",
    "the mid - uv and mg@xmath0 are not consistent with a single metallicity .",

    "we have also modeled the mid - uv features for composite z=0.05 populations with both a 12 gyr and 3 gyr population ( figure 15 ) . while the @xmath4 of m 32 is matched by 5% 3 gyr/ 95 % 12 gyr z=0.05 composite population",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of abundance and age on the mid - uv spectra and mg@xmath0 strengths of stellar populations using simple population synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> these models are used to constrain the star formation history of four nearby elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges . </S>",
    "<S> the mid - uv ( 1800 - 3200  ) light of evolved stellar populations ( @xmath1 1 gyr ) is dominated by the main sequence turn - off , unlike the optical light which is dominated by the red giant branch . because the main sequence turn - off is sensitive to age and metallicity in ways different from the rgb , a detailed investigation of the mid - uv features of elliptical galaxies may help break the age - metallicity degeneracy that plagues optical techniques . also , a better understanding of this wavelength region is useful for the studies of 0.5 @xmath2 z @xmath2 1.5 galaxies for which the rest frame mid - uv is redshifted into the visible . </S>",
    "<S> we create simple , single age ( 3 - 20 gyr ) , single metallicity ( z @xmath3 0.0004 - 0.05 ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) extending into the uv using the kurucz model stellar fluxes . comparison to standard stars mid - uv spectra reveals that the kurucz model fluxes accurately model a blend feature of fei and mgi at 2538  ( bl2538 ) and the slope of the continuum between 2600 and 3100  ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our simple single age , single metallicity seds agree well with these mid - uv features of globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> however , the majority of the galaxies do not agree with the bl2538 , @xmath4 , and mg@xmath0 values given by these simple models . </S>",
    "<S> the mid - uv features appear to require both an old metal - rich and an old metal - poor ( z @xmath2 0.001 ) population . </S>",
    "<S> the implied metal - poor population is less than 10% of the total mass for all the galaxies but dominates the seds shortward of 3000  . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate age ( 1 - 5 gyr ) populations are not required to match the uv for any of the galaxies , but are not ruled out . despite being limited by the quality of the model stellar fluxes , </S>",
    "<S> our study has yielded two promising mid - uv spectral diagnostics ( bl2538 and @xmath4 ) and suggests unique and complex star formation histories for elliptical galaxies . </S>"
