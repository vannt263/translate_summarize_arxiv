    "in the nearby universe , the morphology , color , star formation rate ( sfr ) , and mass of galaxies is correlated with local environmental density .",
    "specifically , galaxies tend to be earlier types , more massive , redder and to have lower sfrs and specific sfrs ( ssfr @xmath5 sfr / m@xmath6 ) in higher density environments ( dressler 1980 ; oemler 1974 ; balogh et al . 2001 ; blanton et al .",

    "; blanton et al . 2003 ; baldry et al . 2004 ) , kauffmann et al . ( 2004 ) bins galaxies by mass and finds that star formation history ( sfh ) depends on the local density at any galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the first evidence that the galaxy population in clusters may evolve with redshift was found by butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) , who observed that galaxies in clusters beyond @xmath0@xmath70.4 tend to be bluer than galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "however , the butcher & oemler observations did not compare the cluster to the field populations at high redshift , while later observations showed that galaxies in all environments had higher sfrs in the past ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ; wilson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "using large surveys able to probe a range of environments at high redshifts , recent observations have found that the sfr - density and color - density relations may be reversed at @xmath0@xmath71 compared to those at @xmath0@xmath70 ( e.g. cucciati et al .",

( 2007 ; e07 ) compare local star - forming sdss galaxies to star - forming galaxies in the goods - s and goods - n fields at @xmath0@xmath7 1 .",
    "they find a reversal of the sfr - density relation : specifically that the median @xmath8sfr@xmath9 decreases with increasing galaxy density in the local sample , while at @xmath0@xmath71 , the median @xmath8sfr@xmath9 first increases with increasing galaxy density before peaking and then decreasing again at the highest densities .",
    "they claim that the increase of @xmath8sfr@xmath9 with local galaxy density is caused by increases of both m@xmath6 and ssfr with galaxy density . because in general ssfr decreases with increasing m@xmath6 ( e.g. blanton et al .",
    "2003 ; baldry et al .",
    "2004 ) , they conclude that at @xmath0@xmath71 the environment must enhance the sfr of galaxies in order for ssfr to increase while m@xmath6 increases .",
    "cooper et al .",
    "( 2008 ; c08 ) also observed the reversal of the sfr - density relation by comparing a local sdss sample to the @xmath0@xmath71 deep2 sample ( not limited to star - forming galaxies ) , but came to a somewhat different conclusion .",
    "because they find that the ssfr decreases with local density at both @xmath0@xmath70 and @xmath0@xmath71 , they conclude that the reversal of the sfr - density relation is mainly due to the different luminosity - density ( and mass - density ) relations of the blue galaxies in their samples at the two redshifts : at @xmath0@xmath71 m@xmath10 increases with local density , while at @xmath0@xmath70 , m@xmath10 is constant with local density .",
    "several observations of individual clusters at @xmath0@xmath71.5 find that they already have a significant passive galaxy population ( e.g. mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ; kurk et al . 2009 ; wilson et al . 2009 ; strazzullo et al . 2010 ) , indicating that at least the color - density relation extends beyond @xmath0@xmath71 .",

    "( 2012 ; q12 ) use a mass - selected sample to show that galaxies with quenched sf tend to reside in dense environments out to as least @xmath0@xmath71.8 . specifically , they find that the quiescent fraction increases with local density , even at high redshift .",
    "it is difficult to synthesize these observational results into a single coherent picture , as they use different wavelengths to measure color and/or sfr , use different methods to measure local density , observe different fields and define their galaxy samples differently .",
    "in addition , semi - analytic models ( sams ) have not reproduced observations of the reversal of the sfr - density or color - density relations ( e07 ; cucciati et al .",
    "2006 ; 2012 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the sfr - density , ssfr - density , and quiescent fraction of galaxies at @xmath0 = 0 and @xmath0 @xmath12 1 in a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation .",
    "we choose these redshifts in order to compare our results to recent work , specifically e07 , c08 , and q12 .",
    "we focus on one region centered around a cluster within a large simulation with box side of 120 @xmath4 mpc , with size 21@xmath1 24@xmath120 @xmath2 mpc@xmath3 , which gives us a broad range of local environments to study .",
    "our goal is to gain physical insight into what sets galaxy sfrs by comparing the sfr , ssfr , and quiescent fraction as a function of environmental density on the same galaxy sample .    after a brief description of our simulations ( section [ sec : boxes ] ) , we discuss our galaxy selection technique and our method for determining quantities for each galaxy in section [ sec : galaxyselection ] . in section [ sec : localdensity ] we define our local density parameter . in section [ sec : obscomparisons ] we compare our results to e07 ( section [ sec : e07 ] ) , c08 ( section [ sec : c08 ] ) and q12 ( section [ sec : q12 ] ) .",
    "we then discuss and interpret our results in terms of the halo mass (  [ sec : story ] ) , and highlight why our results differ from those based on semi - analytic models in section [ sec : simcomparison ] .",

    "for the details of our simulations , we refer the reader to cen ( 2012 ) , although for completeness we reiterate the main points here .",

    "we first ran a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of 120 @xmath4 mpc on a side , and identified a region centered on a cluster at @xmath21 .",
    "we then resimulated the region with high resolution , but embedded within the outer 120 @xmath4 mpc box to properly take into account large - scale tidal field effects and appropriate fluxes of matter , energy and momentum across the boundaries of the refined region .",
    "the refined region we discuss in this paper is 21@xmath124@xmath120 @xmath2 mpc@xmath3 centered on a cluster of @xmath72@xmath110@xmath22 m@xmath23 with a virial radius ( r@xmath24 ) of 1.3 @xmath4 mpc .",
    "we emphasize that this highly - resolved box is much larger than the cluster at its center , and that therefore there are galaxies in a range of local densities . in tonnesen & cen ( 2012 )",
    "we compare the local densities of galaxies in this refined region to a different refined region in the same large periodic box centered around a void , and showed that there is substantial overlap in the distribution of local densities found in the two very different large - scale environments .",
    "we consider two refined simulations of the same region that differ in their level of maximum refinement . in the refined region in the low resolution simulation ,",
    "the minimum cell size is 0.46 @xmath4 kpc , using 11 refinement levels at @xmath21 .",

    "we only have the @xmath0@xmath121 output of the hr simulation , because it has not yet run to @xmath0@xmath120 .",
    "the simulations include a metagalactic uv background ( haardt & madau 1996 ) , a model for shielding of uv radiation by neutral hydrogen ( cen et al . 2005 ) , and metallicity - dependent radiative cooling ( cen et al . 1995 ) . the fraction and density of neutral hydrogen is directly computed within the simulations .",
    "star particles are created in gas cells that satisfy a set of criteria for star formation proposed by cen & ostriker ( 1992 ) , and reiterated with regards to this simulation in cen ( 2012 ) .",
    "once formed , the stellar particle loses mass through gas recycling from type ii supernovae feedback , and about 30% of the stellar particle mass is returned to the ism within a time step .",
    "supernovae feedback is implemented as described in cen ( 2012 ) : feedback energy and ejected metal - enriched mass are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the star particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell , which is to mimic the physical process of supernova blastwave propagation that tends to channel energy , momentum , and mass into the least dense regions ( with the least resistance and cooling ) .",
    "we allow the whole feedback process to be hydrodynamically coupled to surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes , such as cooling and heating , as in nature .",
    "the low resolution simulation used in this paper has compared several galaxy properties that depend critically on the feedback method to observations and found strong agreement ( cen 2011a - c ; cen 2012 ) .",
    "we do not include a prescription for agn feedback in this simulation , and as a result , our simulation overproduces luminous galaxies at the centers of groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "this is discussed in detail in cen ( 2011c ) , who shows that the luminosity function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with observations at @xmath0=0 except at the high - luminosity end .",
    "when cen ( 2011c ) adds an agn feedback correction in the post - simulation analysis for halos with masses greater than 10@xmath27 m@xmath28 or for galaxies with stellar masses above 4@xmath110@xmath29 m@xmath28 , the simulated luminosity function also agrees with observations at the high luminosity end . in the low resolution run ,",
    "each star particle has a mass of @xmath710@xmath30 m@xmath23 , which is similar to the mass of a coeval globular cluster . in the high resolution run",
    ", each star particle has a mass of @xmath710@xmath31 m@xmath23 .",
    "we use hop ( eisenstein & hut 1998 ) to identify galaxies using the stellar particles .",
    "hop uses a two - step procedure to identify individual galaxies .",
    "first , the algorithm assigns a density to each star particle based on the distribution of the surrounding particles and then hops from a particle to its densest nearby neighbor until a maximum is reached .",
    "all particles ( with densities above a minimum threshold , @xmath32 ) that reach the same maximum are identified as one coherent group . in the second step , groups are combined if the density at the saddle point which connects them is greater than @xmath33 ) .",
    "we use hop because of its physical basis , although we expect similar results would be found using a friends - of - friends halo finder .",
    "this has been tested and is robust using reasonable ranges of values ( e.g. tonnesen , bryan , & van gorkom 2007 ) .    after we identify galaxies using stellar particles , we create our sample using only well - resolved galaxies within our refinement region .",
    "first , we restrict our sample to galaxies that have resided in the refined region since the beginning of the simulation . to do this , we require that all of the dark matter particles within the virial radius ( in detail , we use r@xmath24 , the radius within which the average density is 200 times the critical density , which is directly calculated using simulation output ) of each galaxy be the low - mass dark matter particles with which we populated the refined region of our simulation .",
    "second , we only consider those galaxies with a stellar mass greater than 5@xmath110@xmath34 m@xmath23 . we choose this lower limit to our stellar mass because we have found that above this mass our sample is more than 75% complete ( cen 2014 ) .",
    "we have tested that including lower mass galaxies down to 10@xmath25 m@xmath28 has little quantitative and no qualitative effect on our results .",
    "implementing these two criteria leaves 61% of the originally identified galaxies at @xmath0=0 in the low resolution run .",
    "we plotted projections of the star particles of each of the galaxies identified by hop at @xmath0=0 in order to verify first that hop was identifying galaxy - like objects ( with a stellar density peak ) , and second , that hop was not grouping multiple galaxies together .",
    "only a few of the galaxies above our minimum mass that hop identified had density profiles without a strong density peak , and a small number of hop - identified galaxies in fact had two density peaks , and one had three peaks .",
    "both of these problems add up to a misidentification of only 2% .",
    "in this paper we measure the stellar mass ( m@xmath6 ) , dark matter halo mass ( m@xmath35 ) , cold gas mass ( m@xmath36 ) , sfr , m@xmath10 , and @xmath37 @xmath11 @xmath38 color .",
    "stellar mass is determined by adding the mass of each star particle identified by hop to belong to a galaxy .",
    "the dark matter halo mass is calculated by summing the mass of all the dark matter particles out to r@xmath24 .",
    "the cold gas mass is defined slightly differently in the low resolution versus the high resolution simulation due to differences in how the galaxy data sets were originally made , although as we now discuss the differences are minor for the purposes of this paper . in the low resolution",
    "simulation , m@xmath36 is the sum of all hi gas within r@xmath24 . as noted in section [ sec : boxes ] , the fraction and density of neutral hydrogen is directly computed within the simulations .",
    "the high resolution data set includes values of the total gas within 100 kpc and 300 kpc with a temperature less than 10@xmath31 k. because this gas is at the peak of the cooling curve it quickly cools to @xmath710@xmath39 k , and there is therefore little effective difference in the temperatures of the two cold gas definitions .",
    "however , rather than use one or the other of these set radii , in order to compare with the m@xmath36 from the low resolution run we want to include all of the cold gas within r@xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the cold gas within the virial radius of galaxies in the high resolution simulation , we separate the galaxies into low - mass galaxies with m@xmath35 @xmath8 2.5@xmath110@xmath40m@xmath28 ( and therefore virial radii at or less than 100 kpc ) , high - mass galaxies with m@xmath35 @xmath9 6@xmath110@xmath29m@xmath28 ( and virial radii at or greater than 300 kpc ) , and galaxies that fall between these two extremes .",
    "the two extreme cases are simple , and m@xmath36 is either the gas within 100 kpc for the low - mass galaxies or within 300 kpc for the high - mass galaxies . for all other galaxies ,",
    "we use the halo mass to determine the fraction of gas between 100 - 300 kpc that we will include in m@xmath36 , using m@xmath36 = m@xmath41 + ( m@xmath35/6@xmath110@xmath29)@xmath1(m@xmath42-m@xmath41 ) . with these definitions , m@xmath36 is consistent between the low- and high - resolution simulations at @xmath0=1 .",
    "the luminosity of each stellar particle at each of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) five bands is computed using the gissel stellar synthesis code ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) , by supplying the formation time , metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "m@xmath10 is calculated as m@xmath10 @xmath12 @xmath43 + 0.313@xmath1@xmath44 ( lupton 2005 ) .",
    "the sfr for a galaxy is calculated based on the creation time and mass of each star particle .",
    "we choose to use dark matter mass to define the local environment because it is a fundamental measure of the local mass in a region .",
    "further , using dark matter mass is not plagued by the uncertainties in using galaxy counts as a measure of local density . in simulations",
    "the galaxy number count could be affected by resolution issues that may affect galaxy number counts , while in observational samples local galaxy counts may be affected by projection effects due to lack of means to distinguish between peculiar velocity and hubble velocity .",
    "we define the local environment by measuring the dark matter mass in spheres with a comoving radius of 1 @xmath4 mpc . in this paper",
    "we focus on how galaxy sfrs and gas content may be affected on scales larger than the virial radius ( all halos except the cluster halo have virial radii less than 1 @xmath4 mpc ) , for example whether residing in collapsed filaments and pancakes would affect these properties ( cen 2011c ) .",
    "this is done by summing the dark matter mass directly , not demanding that it is within the virial radius of any galaxy .",
    "we randomly select 27 000 positions within the refined region ( with a 2 @xmath4 mpc buffer at each edge ) to be the center of the spheres .",
    "thus we oversample our box and end up with a total of 27 000 environments that we probe , which we differentiate by the dark matter mass in the sphere , m@xmath45 .",
    "however , not every r=1 @xmath4 mpc sphere will contain a galaxy , so when we determine galaxy properties as a function of environment , we only consider those spheres that contain galaxies .",
    "this technique of choosing random spheres in space rather than spheres centered on galaxies differs from that used by many observers , however , e07 compare average sfrs found in regions centered on galaxies to those found in regions centered on grid points independent of galaxy positions , and find negligible difference between the two techniques .",
    "we first determine whether our sfr - density relation evolves from @xmath0@xmath120 to @xmath0@xmath121 . to facilitate comparisons to e07 we use similar galaxy selection criteria and methods .",
    "e07 study the evolution of the sfr - density relation by comparing local sdss galaxies to the goods - s and goods - n fields at @xmath0 @xmath7 1 .",
    "they use a magnitude cut in both samples , m@xmath10 @xmath46 -20 , which they state is equivalent to a stellar mass cutoff of m@xmath6 @xmath47 10@xmath34 m@xmath28 at @xmath0@xmath120.8 and m@xmath6 @xmath47 10@xmath48 m@xmath28 at @xmath0@xmath12 1.2 ( the two extremes of their high - redshift range ) .",
    "the local galaxy density is determined by counting all the galaxies within boxes centered on each galaxy of 1.5 comoving mpc on a side , in a velocity interval @xmath49@xmath50 @xmath12 @xmath49@xmath0/(1 + @xmath0 ) , @xmath49@xmath0 @xmath120.02 .",
    "e07 only include star - forming galaxies in their sample , down to sfr@xmath51 limits of 0.5 m@xmath28 yr@xmath19 for the @xmath0@xmath71 sample .",
    "they use the star - forming galaxy sample and sfrs calculated in brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the low - redshift sdss sample .",
    "e07 first calculates an average sfr ( @xmath8sfr@xmath9 ) and local galaxy density in boxes centered on every galaxy .",
    "then they group the galaxies into local density bins and find the median of the distribution of @xmath8sfr@xmath9 .",

    "these results are not reproduced by a sam using the millennium simulation . in the sam , there is never a reversal of the sfr - density relation , just a gradual flattening ( it is not flat by @xmath0@xmath121 ) .",

    "2006 ) , which may lead to low levels of star formation in galaxies that would otherwise have no star formation . in high density environments , like the inner regions of clusters , cold gas may be used too quickly to form stars , and , as we have suggested above , decreasing the star formation efficiency may also reduce this discrepancy between our simulation and observations .",

    "there are not enough galaxies with high sfrs to drive a dramatic increase in the median sfr . as we argue in  [ sec : c08 ] , this agrees with the observational finding by cooper et al . ( 2006 ) of a population of brighter blue galaxies in high local density environments at @xmath0@xmath71 .",
    "we also find that , using the same galaxy sample that shows an evolution in the sfr - density relation , there is an increasing fraction of red , quiescent galaxies as m@xmath45 increases ( bottom panel of figure [ fig - quadri ] ) .",
    "until the red fraction increases to 50% of the galaxies in the sample , much of the median sfr value will depend upon the distribution of the sfrs of the star - forming galaxies .",

    "the m@xmath36 of the low- and high - density samples seems to be very different at high m@xmath35 , but some of this is probably due to the higher mass of galaxies at higher local densities , which is corrected for in the m@xmath36/m@xmath66 plot .",
    "in addition to the median m@xmath36 and m@xmath36/m@xmath6 tending to be higher at high m@xmath45 than at low m@xmath45 , we see a tendency in all panels for the 25th-75th percentile range of the high - density galaxy sample to be higher than that of the low - density galaxy sample .    at @xmath0=0 ( figure [ fig - z0mhalo ] ) ,",
    "the low- and high - density samples lie close enough to one another that again it is difficult to immediately determine whether the environment directly impacts the sfr and/or m@xmath36 of galaxies . in both the sfr and m@xmath36 panels",
    ", the main difference between low- and high - density galaxies is the larger 25th-75th percentile range of galaxies in high - m@xmath45 regions .",
    "however , when comparing sfr to ssfr and m@xmath36 to m@xmath36/m@xmath6 , it becomes clear that the sfr and m@xmath36 of high - m@xmath45 galaxies is enhanced by a larger fraction of high - m@xmath6 galaxies .",
    "the differences between the low - density and high - density medians normalized by m@xmath6 are larger than the absolute sfr and m@xmath36 .",
    "indeed , the difference between the ssfr of low- and high - density galaxy samples in the lowest or highest m@xmath35 bin is similar to the difference between the ssfr in neighboring m@xmath35 bins .",
    "in addition , opposite to the trend at @xmath0@xmath121 , the 25th-75th percentile range of values differs in the ssfr plot with a consistently higher range of ssfrs in the low - density subsample than in the high - density subsample . also , when we normalize for m@xmath6 , we see that in the two lowest m@xmath35 bins , the difference in median m@xmath36/m@xmath6 between galaxies in low- and high - density environments is twice that between galaxies in the same environment .",
    "it seems that at @xmath0@xmath120 local density has a similar level of impact on the sfr and m@xmath36 of galaxies as the halo mass itself , particularly for lower mass halos ( m@xmath35@xmath810@xmath67 m@xmath28 ) .",
    "when comparing figures [ fig - z1mhalo ] and [ fig - z0mhalo ] , we see that the difference between low- and high - density galaxies in any individual m@xmath35 bin tends to show the opposite trends at the two redshifts . at @xmath0=0 , galaxies in high local density regions tend to have lower sfr , ssfr , m@xmath36 and m@xmath36/m@xmath6 than galaxies in low local density regions .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath0=1 , galaxies in high local density regions tend to have _ higher _ ssfr and m@xmath36/m@xmath6 than galaxies in low local density regions . at @xmath0=1 m@xmath35",
    "is a much stronger driver of galaxy sfr and m@xmath36 than m@xmath45 , and we have provided clear evidence that the effect of the environment becomes more important at lower redshift .      why does our fully hydrodynamical simulation succeed in reproducing the observed increase in @xmath8sfr@xmath9 with increasing local density at @xmath0=1 while sams do not ( as shown in elbaz et al .",
    "2007 ) ? before we consider how the inclusion of hydrodynamics will affect our results , we consider the difference in dark matter resolution in our simulation versus the millennium simulation . in our low resolution",
    "refined region , dark matter particles are @xmath710@xmath25 m@xmath28 , about an order of magnitude better than the mass resolution of the millennium simulation .",
    "thus , we can resolve smaller dark matter halos . as we show in the bottom panel of figure [ fig - dmhiall ] ,",
    "the increase in the median galaxy halo mass is one of the main causes of the increasing sfr with increasing m@xmath45 at @xmath0@xmath121 . in the lowest m@xmath45 , while we find @xmath8m@xmath35@xmath9@xmath71 - 2@xmath110@xmath40 m@xmath28 , the number of @xmath710@xmath40 m@xmath28 halos in the millennium simulation may be significantly under - estimated due to mass resolution .",
    "guo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) compare the dark matter halo mass functions in the millennium simulation and in ms - ii , which has more than two orders of magnitude better resolution .",
    "they find that at m@xmath35= 10@xmath40 the mass density of halos in ms is 75% that in ms - ii ( while at m@xmath35= 10@xmath29 they nearly agree ) .",
    "if , due to this resolution - dependent underdensity of low - mass halos , @xmath8m@xmath35@xmath9 is forced to be an order of magnitude higher at low local densities , there may be no increase in @xmath8sfr@xmath9 with increasing local density",
    ". it may be possible to check whether resolution is the main issue by determining if sams can reproduce the reversal of the sfr - density relation when halos from the millenium - ii simulation are included in the analysis .",
    "our different results may also be due to differences in the treatment of gasphysics , including sne feedback processes and large - scale structure collapse induced shock heating .",
    "we find some correlation between m@xmath45 and the m@xmath36 and sfr of galaxies ( figures [ fig - dmhiall ] , [ fig - z1mhalo ] , & [ fig - z0mhalo ] ) .",
    "cen ( 2011c ) discusses how gravitational heating can be important outside of virialized regions , for example in collapsed filaments and pancakes .",
    "this may be more likely to affect the reservoir of cold gas available to galaxies in high - density large - scale environments . because we self - consistently include gravitational heating , our simulations include these affects while sams can not .      here",
    "we will address the effects of agn feedback and resolution on our results .",
    "first , as discussed in section [ sec : boxes ] , we do not include agn feedback in this analysis .",
    "cen ( 2011c ) included a feedback prescription in which star formation is suppressed by a factor @xmath68 = @xmath69 post simulation , which results in better agreement between the simulated and observed @xmath0=0 @xmath38-band luminosity functions .",
    "this suppression factor only has a large effect on galaxies in halos with masses at or above 10@xmath27 m@xmath28 , so as is clear from figure [ fig - dmhiall ] , it only has a strong effect on the highest density bin .",
    "this agn feedback implementation lowers the @xmath8sfr@xmath9 in figure [ fig - elbaz ] by 45% in the final bin of @xmath0=1 lr , resulting in a flat @xmath8sfr@xmath9-density relation across the two highest density bins .",
    "the change is 30% in final bins of the @xmath0=1 hr and @xmath0=0 outputs , and the shape of the @xmath8sfr@xmath9-density relation stays unchanged .",
    "the general shape of figure [ fig - cooper ] also remains unchanged , although the decrease of sfr and ssfr is slightly steeper in the final two bins for all outputs , which is at densities higher than observed in c08 .",
    "the differences in all of our other figures when we include this agn feedback are also minor with no qualitative change in our results .",
    "while it is useful to point out that our results do not change when we include this form of agn feedback , because of uncertainties in how agn feedback should be implemented it is more clear to present our results without post - processing .",
    "importantly , it is not clear that using the same relation between agn feedback and halo mass is appropriate at @xmath0=0 and @xmath0=1 ( see discussion in the review by kormendy & ho 2013 & references therein ) .",
    "if black holes grow before bulges , then the agn might be more massive at @xmath0=1 than at @xmath0=0 .",
    "kormendy & ho ( 2013 ) argue that black holes are twice as massive relative to the bulge mass using @xmath0@xmath472 quasars ( but see , e.g. , schulze & wisotzki 2014 ; kisaka & kojima 2010 ) .",
    "if the suppression of sf by agn feedback is directly proportional to agn mass , then we can test the importance of this difference by suppressing sf by an extra factor of two at @xmath0=1 .",
    "even if we suppress star formation in the @xmath0=1 outputs by a factor of two more than at @xmath0=0 , the difference between @xmath0=1 and @xmath0=0 remains .",
    "testing every permutation of star formation suppression by agn feedback is beyond the scope of this paper , but the fact that our results remain unchanged when including these two possible forms of agn feedback lead us to believe that the large difference in the sfr - density relation we find at @xmath0=1 and @xmath0=0 is robust to variations in the prescription used to implement agn feedback .",
    "resolution can have several impacts on our results , and we are able to examine these effects by comparing our results in the @xmath0=1 lr output to the @xmath0=1 hr output .",
    "overmerging , discussed in detail in reference to these simulations in lackner et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , is a resolution issue in which a lower resolution is in general more conducive to merging among galaxies in crowded environments , such as clusters of galaxies ( white 1976 ; moore et al .",
    "because overmerging will have more of an effect at larger local densities , the higher resolution run may naturally have a flatter m@xmath6-density relation . as we see in the bottom panel of figure [ fig - essfr ]",
    ", overmerging does not seem to have caused a difference between the low resolution and high resolution runs by @xmath0=1 .",
    "if overmerging occurs between @xmath0=1 and @xmath0=0 , and results in galaxies that are too massive at @xmath0=0 , the simulated sfrs will be higher than observed sfrs - which is indeed what we see in our comparisons .",
    "however , lowering the sfrs in our simulation at @xmath0=0 will only serve to increase the difference in the relation between the two redshifts , so will only strengthen our result .",
    "resolution may also impact the effect of sn feedback on galaxies . in our implementation of supernovae feedback",
    ", energy is channeled into the 27 gas cells surrounding the star particle . with lower resolution",
    ", this energy input will not heat the gas to as high temperatures and may allow it to cool relatively more quickly , hence may result in a reduced negative feedback effect in comparison to the higher resolution simulation .",
    "as with overmerging , we see that this can not be a large effect up to @xmath0=1 because the low and high resolution runs have similar galaxy mass distributions .",
    "however , at @xmath0=1 the sfrs , particularly at high densities and in higher mass halos , are larger in the low resolution run than in the high resolution run . by this",
    "late in the simulation the galaxies may be massive enough that in the high density central regions of halos rapid cooling is occurring . while in the high resolution run supernovae feedback may result in lower sfrs , the lower resolution run has higher sfrs .",
    "it is noteworthy that the difference in the low and high resolution runs at @xmath0=1 begins at higher m@xmath45 than the difference between the @xmath0=1 outputs and the @xmath0=0 output .",
    "_ these differences due to resolution do not outweigh the differences in the sfr - density relation at low and high redshift .",
    "_    it is not immediately clear how a difference in supernovae heating would affect @xmath0=0 sfrs .",
    "if more gas is able to cool in the low resolution run and supernovae continue to heat the gas more efficiently in the high resolution run , the sfrs may be higher than in a high resolution run .",
    "however , if more of the available gas is used quickly in the low resolution run , the sfrs may be lower at @xmath0=0 in the lower resolution run because of a lack of fuel .",
    "schaye et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find a lower sfr at late times ( @xmath0@xmath461 ) in higher resolution runs , in agreement with our findings .",
    "as they use a lower resolution sph simulation and a different feedback scheme , we can not simply assume their results apply to our simulation , but as we have noted above , a lower sfr at @xmath0=0 better matches observations and strengthens our results .",
    "in this paper we examine the sfr - density and color - density relations at @xmath0=0 and @xmath0=1 in high resolution cosmological simulations with a refined region of size 21@xmath124@xmath120 @xmath2 mpc@xmath3 centered on a cluster of mass @xmath70m@xmath28 at @xmath0=0 .",
    "this refined region has a large range of local densities , which allows us to separate the halo - scale from the larger - scale environment .",
    "we have utilized the high resolution ( 0.114 - 0.46 @xmath4 kpc ) in these simulations to examine the sfr of a large sample of galaxies in detail to determine how galaxy properties are related to environment on a 1 @xmath4 mpc scale at @xmath0=0 versus @xmath0=1 .",
    "our results are summarized below .",
    "+ 1 ) at z=1 , our simulations produce sfrs that increase strongly with increasing local density , as in the observations of e07 ( figure [ fig - elbaz ] ) .",
    "we also find strong evolution in our sfr - density relation from @xmath0=1 to a much flatter sfr - density relation at @xmath0=0 .",
    "in addition , we reproduce the results of cooper et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that the ssfr decreases with increasing density at both @xmath0=1 and @xmath0=0 ( figure [ fig - cooper ] ) .",
    "however , as in elbaz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , when we only consider the massive galaxies in our sample , 5@xmath110@xmath48 @xmath8 m@xmath6/m@xmath28 , both ssfr and m@xmath6 increase with local density ( m@xmath45 ) up to @xmath73@xmath110@xmath29 ( figure [ fig - essfr ] ) .",
    "we find that the increase in median sfr with increasing local density ( m@xmath45 ) at @xmath0=1 is caused by an increasing fraction of highly - star forming galaxies at a given local density at higher local densities .",
    "massive ( 5@xmath110@xmath48 @xmath8 m@xmath6/m@xmath28 ) star - forming galaxies drive the increasing sfr - density relation .",

    "( 2007 ) , we find that the red fraction increases as a function of local density ( m@xmath45 ) at both @xmath0=0 and @xmath0=1 ( figure [ fig - quadri ] ) . there is no tension between the dramatic difference in the sfr - density relation at @xmath0=1 compared to @xmath0=0 and the consistency of the color - density relation .",
    "+ 3 ) we find that the relationship between median m@xmath35 and local density ( m@xmath45 ) is an important cause of the redshift - dependent behavior of the sfr - density relation ( figure [ fig - dmhiall ] ) .",
    "the sfr and m@xmath36 values at @xmath0=0 begin to diverge from those at @xmath0=1 at lower m@xmath45 , @xmath74@xmath110@xmath29 , than the m@xmath35 values diverge , at m@xmath45@xmath78@xmath110@xmath29 .",
    "we also show that the local environment on scales of 1 @xmath4 mpc is more important at @xmath0@xmath120 than at @xmath0=1 , and affects galaxy sfrs as much as halo mass at @xmath0=0 ( figures [ fig - z1mhalo ] & [ fig - z0mhalo ] ) .",
