    "when cooper pairs from a superconductor ( s ) penetrate a ferromagnet ( f ) at a sf interface the spin - up electron decreases its spin energy because of zeeman splitting whereas the spin - down electron increases its spin energy . as a consequence the spin - up electron accelerates and the spin - down electron decelerates so that cooper pairs acquire a finite center of mass momentum @xmath11 .",
    "this induces spatial oscillations of the pair amplitude in the ferromagnet . if the length @xmath3 of the ferromagnet is well chosen the josephson relation of a sfs junction can be inverted , giving rise to a @xmath2-junction  @xcite . the determination of the current - phase relation in sns ( where n is a normal metal ) and sfs junctions is a long standing problem ( see the recent review by golubov",
    "_ et al . _",
    "the oscillations of the transition temperature of fs superlattices  @xcite as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnet are another consequence of the @xmath2-coupling .",
    "sfs @xmath2-junction have been probed recently in experiments in which the ferromagnet is a magnetic alloy with a sufficiently small exchange field  @xcite so that the period of the spatial oscillations of the pair amplitude is large enough . in the following",
    "we discuss a recent experiment  @xcite in which half - integer shapiro steps were observed in a nb / cuni / nb junction at the @xmath1-@xmath2 cross - over , indicating a @xmath10 current - phase relation . for highly transparent interfaces and without decoherence",
    "the current - phase relation is related to the derivative of the energy of the andreev bound states with respect to the superconducting phase difference between the two superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the exchange field in the ferromagnet generates a zeeman splitting of the spectrum of andreev bound states , which was the explanation of the @xmath0 harmonics at the @xmath1-@xmath2 cross - over proposed by sellier _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . to explain the tiny magnitude of the residual supercurrent at the 0-@xmath2 cross - over , sellier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested the existence of a strong decoherence in the magnetic alloy .",
    "however within this assumption the andreev bound states are broadened so that the supercurrent can not be anymore evaluated as the derivative of the bound state energies .",
    "this calls for a specific modeling of @xmath2 junction involving decoherence in the ferromagnet .",
    "the origin of decoherence in a magnetic alloy is not well characterized experimentally , because it is not possible to carry out weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations as a function of an applied magnetic field .",
    "quantum coherence in a ferromagnet was however studied in a recent experiment using time - dependent universal conductance fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "one source of decoherence in a ferromagnet is spin waves but other effects can play a role such as spatial heterogeneities of the exchange field or domain wall motion  @xcite .",
    "we discuss here the effect of decoherence in the magnetic alloy , motivated by the experimental observations of a very small residual supercurrent at the @xmath1-@xmath2 cross - over and more generally to a huge reduction of the supercurrent compared to a model not involving decoherence  @xcite .",
    "we show that decoherence in the ferromagnet implies the existence of a length @xmath4 , intermediate between ( i ) the elastic mean free path @xmath5 due to elastic scattering on impurities in the absence of decoherence , and ( ii ) the coherence length @xmath6 due to decoherence in the magnetic alloy in the absence of elastic scattering on impurities .",
    "the @xmath9 harmonics due to the coherent transfer of a charge-@xmath12 is proportional to @xmath13 , and the @xmath10 harmonics due to the coherence transfer of a charge-@xmath14 is proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath3 is the length of the ferromagnet .",
    "the length scale @xmath4 can be smaller than @xmath3 even though @xmath6 is larger than @xmath3 .",
    "therefore we base our description on the first two terms of an expansion in the coherent transfer of multiples of a charge-@xmath16 . similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite the dressing by multiple local andreev reflections is described non perturbatively so that our description is valid for highly transparent interfaces .",
    "we also treat rigorously the geometrical effects related to propagation parallel to the interfaces .",

    "we add to ( [ eq : stoner ] ) a term describing elastic scattering by impurities .",
    "the ferromagnet is connected to the superconducting layers by the hamiltonian @xmath22 where the label @xmath18 runs over all sites at the interface .    to describe propagation in the ferromagnet we use the advanced green s function of a bulk ballistic 3d ferromagnet @xmath23 where @xmath6 is the phase coherence length .",
    "a similar expression is obtained for @xmath24 .",
    "we will discuss how to incorporate disorder in the ferromagnetic electrode .",
    "the green s functions of a superconductor can be found in the literature  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : sp - i - def ] ) can be derived from keldysh formalism  @xcite by noting that in equilibrium the keldysh green s function takes the simple form @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the fully dressed green s functions @xmath31 are determined through the dyson equation @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the self energy corresponding to the bonds @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath29 denotes a summation over the sites @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( see fig .  [",

    "@xmath66 is proportional to @xmath71 and @xmath72 is proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "we now evaluate the average over disorder of @xmath74 and show that , like for crossed andreev reflection  @xcite , disorder changes the value of the exponent in the geometrical prefactor compared to the ballistic case and therefore enhances the supercurrent through the ferromagnet compared to the ballistic case .",

    "_  @xcite .",
    "the value of the bulk hopping amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 are chosen equal to avoid multiplying the number of parameters , and such that the diffusion constant of the ferromagnet is close to @xmath89  @xmath90s@xmath91  @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath92  k and the elastic mean free path is @xmath93    @xcite .",
    "the fermi wave - vector @xmath94 in the superconductor is chosen equal to @xmath95  @xmath91 , and the lattice parameter is chosen equal to @xmath96   . since the interfaces are highly transparent we choose @xmath97 .",
    "we fix the ratio between @xmath6 and @xmath98 in the ballistic system to be smaller than unity , and determine the exchange field in such a way that the @xmath9 harmonics vanishes for the same value of @xmath3 as in the experiment .",

    "this fit is not compatible with the three experimental points with the largest values of @xmath3 and the residual value of the supercurrent at the @xmath1-@xmath2 cross - over is far too large ( curve ( a ) on fig .",

    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "the agreement of the fits of the amplitudes of both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 harmonics suggest the validity of the fit ( c ) .",
    "the renormalization of the coherence length @xmath4 compared to its value @xmath8 in the absence of decoherence may depend on the quality of the magnetic layer since it is expected qualitatively that decoherence is reduced with less inhomogeneities in the exchange field .",
    "to conclude we have provided a modeling of the @xmath10 current - phase relation in sfs junctions at the @xmath1-@xmath2 cross - over .",
    "this model is motivated by the fact that the residual supercurrent at the 0-@xmath2 cross - over is very small , therefore suggesting that decoherence in the ferromagnet plays a relevant role , as suggested by sellier _",
    "et al _  @xcite .",
    "decoherence was introduced through a phenomenological coherence length @xmath6 .",
    "elucidating precisely its microscopic origin is difficult experimentally but several factors ( spin waves , inhomogeneities in the exchange field , motion of domain walls ) may play a role .",
    "the supercurrent was calculated through an expansion in the number of non local processes connecting the two interfaces .",
    "lowest order processes correspond to a coherent transfer of a charge-@xmath16 contributing to the @xmath9 harmonics and the next order corresponds to a coherent transfer of a charge-@xmath116 contributing to the @xmath10 harmonics .",
    "like for crossed andreev reflection  @xcite these non local processes are dressed by multiple local andreev reflections that were included in a non perturbative fashion .",
    "we also included the geometrical effect of propagation parallel to the interfaces .",
    "we found that in the ferromagnet disorder effects ( characterized by the elastic scattering length @xmath5 in the absence of decoherence ) and decoherence ( characterized by the coherence length @xmath6 in the ballistic limit ) generate a new coherence length @xmath4 , intermediate between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and smaller than the exchange length @xmath8 evaluated in the diffusive limit in the absence of decoherence .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath9 harmonics is proportional to @xmath13 and the amplitude of the @xmath10 harmonics is proportional to @xmath117 so that @xmath13 is a small parameter in the expansion in non local andreev processes .",
    "the approach is consistent in the sense that the fit to experiments shows that @xmath13 is a very small parameter [ we have @xmath118 for the fit ( c ) on fig .  [",
    "fig : fit ] ] so that the @xmath119 and higher harmonics can indeed be neglected .",
