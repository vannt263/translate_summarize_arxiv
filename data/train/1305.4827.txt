    "the former implies a kind of quark - lepton symmetry , or unification , or common horizontal symmetry which lead to equality of the 1 - 2 mixings in the quark and lepton sectors .",

    "the latter case is referred as the tribimaximal - cabibbo mixing .",
    "the permutation is needed to reduce the mixing matrix to the standard form .",
    "the relation was first realized at the purely phenomenological level  @xcite and then in the quark - lepton complementarity ( qlc ) framework  @xcite .",

    "@xmath34 this equality is similar to the one in the quark sector : @xmath35 .",
    "it may indicate that the mixing patterns of quarks and leptons are organized in the same way but with certain rescaling .",
    "that would testify for ( i ) a kind of fritzsch ansatz for mass matrices ; ( ii ) normal mass hierarchy ; ( iii ) relation between masses and mixing ; ( iv ) flavor ordering or alignment in the mass matrix .",
    "the later means that values of elements of the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis gradually decrease from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , due to deviation of the 2 - 3 mixing from maximal sharp difference of the elements of the dominant @xmath38-block and the sub - dominant @xmath39line is washed out .",
    "it seems that neutrino mass matrix is rescaling of the charged fermion mass matrices with weaker hierarchy of the elements .",
    "this can originate from power dependence of elements on large expansion parameter @xmath40 .",
    "it looks like another complementarity : @xmath41 .",
    "the power dependence could testify for a kind of froggatt - nielsen mechanism .",
    "no one of these results explicitly testifies for discrete flavor symmetries , although , as we will see later , consequences of symmetry can be hidden in rather complicated relations between mixing parameters .",
    "it seems that relations @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 have no connection to discrete symmetries at all , the relation @xmath45 may require the symmetry to explain the maximal 2 - 3 rotation from neutrino sector , finally @xmath46 may or may not be a consequence of symmetry .",
    "existence of sterile neutrinos with the ev - scale mass can strongly affect our considerations .",
    "their mixing with active neutrinos is not a small perturbation of the @xmath47 pattern : all theoretical constructions should be reconsidered unless further complications and fine tunings are introduced @xcite .",
    "future developments in the field will be related ( apart from better measurements of known parameters ) to    * clarification of the situation with sterile neutrinos ; * checks of the claim of the neutrinoless double beta decay observation in the heidelberg - moscow experiment ; and * establishing neutrino mass hierarchy .    all this will have serious impact on our understanding of mixings and masses and relevance of the discrete flavor symmetries .",
    "as far as the mass hierarchy is concerned , in the @xmath48 approximation changing the hierarchy means flip of the sign : @xmath49 .",
    "the discrete symmetry transformation can be introduced which makes this flip .",
    "the case of inverted hierarchy is the special since it implies strong degeneracy of the two mass states @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 .",
    "this strong degeneracy can be a consequence of certain discrete symmetry .",
    "however it is not accompanied by maximal mixing , which leads to certain tension .",
    "a number of proposals are participating in the `` race '' for the mass hierarchy . many are related to influence of matter effects on the 1 - 3 mixing : in uniform or nearly uniform medium the resonance enhancement of oscillations driven by the 1 - 3 mixing is in the neutrino channel for nh and in the antineutrino channel in the case of ih . to some extend this can be explored using the beam experiments , e.g. , in nova  @xcite .",
    "the measured relatively large 1 - 3 mixing ensures that in supernova the 1 - 3 level crossing ( h resonance ) is highly adiabatic .",
    "consequently , conversion effects in the cases of nh and ih are strongly different @xcite . that determines also the oscillation effects of sn neutrinos in the matter of the earth .",
    "observation of the oscillation effect in the antineutrino channel would be the proof of nh @xcite .",
    "huge atmospheric neutrino detectors with low ( @xmath53 gev ) energy threshold such as pingu  @xcite and orca have good chance to be the first and the cheapest ones @xcite .",
    "these experiments have also good potential to measure precisely the 2 - 3 mixing and mass splitting .",
    "we assume that neutrinos are majorana particles , and that the discrete flavor symmetry can be embedded into @xmath54 .",
    "the latter requires that determinants of the transformation matrices should be 1 .",
    "in what follows we will consider the framework of the residual symmetries  @xcite in details .",

    "( iii ) the formalism can be generalized to include non - generic neutrino symmetries @xmath2 which lead to relations between mixings and neutrino masses .",

    "the formalism presented here can be used in various ways . in specific model ,",
    "once the residual symmetries are identified the consequences on mixing and masses can be obtained immediately .",
    "the formalism allows to analyze systematically possible mixing patterns that can be extracted from the finite groups or subgroups of the von dyck type .",
    "inversely , for a given pattern of mixing the formalism allows to perform the `` symmetry building '' - identify the residual and covering symmetry groups .",
    "the formalism allows also to explain various features of mixing matrix which follow from symmetries . in particular , in the case of klein group in the neutrino sector",
    "it can explain appearance of mixing patterns in which two or three columns of @xmath73 have equal but permuted elements .",
    "further generalizations of the formalism are possible . on the other hand ,",
    "discrete symmetries can be realized in some other way in frameworks which differs from ( [ framework ] ) .",
    "mixing ( or its zero order structure ) can originate from different nature of the mass terms of the charged leptons ( dirac ) and neutrinos ( majorana ) , or from neutrino mixing with new degrees of freedom ( e.g. , singlets of sm ) .",
