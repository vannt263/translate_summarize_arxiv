    "recent experiments on dynamical fracture @xcite have shown that cracks in brittle materials become unstable above a critical velocity .",
    "this instability is associated with the formation of a roughened fracture surface , with an increased dissipation of elastic energy , and with complicated velocity dynamics - for a review , see @xcite .",
    "although there are hints of such an instability in the traditional continuum formulations of ideally brittle cracks @xcite , a systematic treatment does not appear possible .",
    "indeed , recent attempts @xcite to utilize a cohesive stress modification @xcite of the continuum elastic equations in order to address this problem have been rather unsuccessful .    in the absence of a compelling continuum approach",
    ", one must deal in some manner with discrete dynamics on the  atomic scale \" . in this",
    "regard , slepyan @xcite pioneered the idea of studying lattice models in which atoms interact ( via piece - wise linear springs ) with their neighbors in a predetermined lattice geometry .",
    "this conceptual framework was further developed by marder and collaborators @xcite . here",
    ", one can directly obtain the relationship between the crack tip velocity and the imposed driving and furthermore one can search for conditions which do not allow stable steady crack motion .",
    "clearly , lattice models are not fully realistic , especially at displacements that are not small compared to the underlying lattice spacing ; to be more realistic , one must resort to molecular dynamics simulations including all possible atomic interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the analytic tractability of these models as well as indications @xcite that they do contain the essential mechanism responsible for the observed dynamical instability make them well worthy of serious attention .",
    "slepyan recognized that in an ideally brittle material ( where each spring is linear until a displacement at which it completely breaks ) one can use fourier methods to find the lattice analog of a traveling wave solution .",
    "in this solution , each point on the lattice ( at the same transverse coordinate ) undergoes the same time history of motion as any other , albeit with some time delay .",
    "once one obtains the solution , one must check that all springs assumed to be linear have displacements that are in fact below the breaking threshold .",
    "the violation of this assumption by the steadily propagating solution signals the onset of more complex dynamical behavior , at least in qualitative accord to what is seen experimentally @xcite . using the wiener - hopf technique ,",
    "slepyan solved for the velocity - driving curve in the limit where the width of the lattice transverse to the crack direction goes to infinity .    one important consideration in all models of brittle fracture concerns dissipation mechanisms . from our perspective",
    ", it makes sense to put in dissipation at the lattice scale in such a way so as not dominate the large - scale continuum elastic field .",
    "if in addition one demands an equation that is local in time , one is led @xcite to the introduction of a kelvin viscosity which dissipates energy proportional to the rate of change of spring lengths . in the naive continuum limit , this gives rise to a third derivative ( two space , one time ) term .",
    "that means that if the viscosity is chosen to be o(1 ) on the lattice scale , it will scale to zero as far as the macroscopic dynamics is concerned .",
    "we saw this explicitly in a previous set of papers @xcite which solved this problem for finite width lattices and considered the nature of the solution as the width became large .",
    "nevertheless , the viscosity can have a considerable effect on aspects of the solution which depend on the microscopic details , namely the crack speed ( for a fixed stress intensity factor ) and the self - consistency of the traveling wave ansatz .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we formally define the model , employing slepyan s idea @xcite of replacing the driving at some external boundary with some local forcing on the crack surface .",
    "this allows for the solution in section iii of the strictly infinite lattice model ; the connection to a finite problem with some displacement driving is made by appealing to the universality of the microscopic crack solution given a fixed stress intensity factor . in the following section",
    ", we discuss the numerical evaluation of the velocity curve from its formal expression . following that , we turn to the aforementioned self - consistency condition and study the effect of dissipation on the critical velocity .",
    "we conclude with some observations in the final section .",
    "we wish to study mode iii cracks and the effects thereupon of kelvin viscosity .",
    "our model thus consists of a square lattice of mass points undergoing ( scalar ) displacements out of the plane .",
    "the lattice extends infinitely long in both the @xmath0 ( along - crack ) and @xmath1 ( transverse ) directions .",
    "the lattice points are connected to their nearest neighbors by ideally brittle springs which behave linearly with spring constant 1 until some threshold elongation @xmath2 at which point they irreversibly crack .",
    "all the ( uncracked ) springs have a viscous damping @xmath3 .",
    "let us assume that the crack corresponds to a sequential breaking of the vertical bonds between the mass points at rows @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the equation of motion for the masses in rows @xmath6 reads @xmath7 we allow the vertical bonds along the crack surface to have a different spring constant @xmath8 and damping parameter @xmath9 , to model the effect of having weak links along the crack surface .",
    "the equation for @xmath4 then reads , using the assumed symmetry @xmath10 , @xmath11 it is easily verified that the equations for @xmath12 are consistent with the above symmetry .",
    "we can , without loss of generality choose @xmath13 ( so that the threshold elongation is unity ) .",
    "note that in these units , the elastic wave speed is unity , so all velocities are dimensionless , expressed as fractions of the wave speed .",
    "we are interested in steady - state cracks , described by the slepyan traveling wave ansatz , @xmath14 which implies that every mass point in a given row undergoes the same time history , translated in time .",
    "we choose the origin of time such that @xmath15 , so that it represents the moment of cracking of the spring in column 0 .",
    "if we define @xmath16 , the equations of motion for @xmath6 become @xmath17 for @xmath4 , we separate out the terms proportional to @xmath18 , giving @xmath19 the driving term for this equation has the form @xmath20 \\ .\\ ] ] in this expression , we have inserted an external force @xmath21 which acts on the crack boundaries .",
    "this force is an artifice which serves as an inhomogeneous source term , in place of introducing the driving through the boundary condition on the top and bottom surfaces .",
    "we will see later how to choose this function .",
    "we fourier transform with respect to @xmath22 ( see the appendix for our conventions regarding fourier transforms and fourier integrals ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath23^{y-1 } $ ] for @xmath24 , we obtain from eqn .",
    "( [ eomy ] ) the dispersion relationship @xmath25 this can be rewritten as @xmath26 which therefore implies that @xmath27 .",
    "if we define @xmath28 then we can write @xmath29 note that we have must choose the sign that corresponds to a decaying solution in the @xmath1 direction , i.e. @xmath30 .    if we substitute this ansatz into eqn .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) , we get @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fourier transform of @xmath33 . noting that @xmath34",
    ", we obtain @xmath35 with @xmath36    this equation is implicit , since the driving term @xmath32 on the right hand side still depends on the displacement field @xmath37 . in the next section , we solve this equation via the wiener - hopf technique .",
    "let us define @xmath38 , the bond elongation between rows @xmath5 and @xmath4 . in the appendix , we define @xmath39 and @xmath40 as the decomposition of @xmath41 into terms which are analytic in the upper and lower half planes respectively .",
    "this allows us to write eq .",
    "( [ forcek ] ) as @xmath42 where we have employed a similar breakup for the driving term @xmath21 , and where we have utilized eq .",
    "( [ derivative ] ) .    substituting the formula for @xmath43 into eqn .",
    "( [ chi ] ) for @xmath44 leads to a closed form equation for @xmath45 ; namely @xmath46 defining @xmath47 by @xmath48 we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ rawk ] ) as @xmath49    we will solve this equation using the wiener - hopf technique . the key is to factor @xmath47 into a product of two pieces , @xmath50 , each of which is regular in the upper ( @xmath51 ) or lower ( @xmath52 ) half plane .",
    "doing so , we get @xmath53 we then have to deal with the extra singularity at @xmath54 .",
    "we do this by a simple subtraction @xmath55 we have now to choose @xmath21 , our external forcing . in taking the width to infinity , in essence",
    "we are solving for the `` inner '' solution in the sense of boundary - layer theory ; i.e. , only on the scale of the lattice spacing . the external forcing in the finite width problem only acts on the large scale , and does not vary on the lattice scale .",
    "thus , @xmath21 must have support only at @xmath56 . following slepyan , then",
    ", we choose @xmath21 such that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a constant .",
    "this then gives us the the two separate equations    [ vpm ] @xmath59    as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ limp ] ) and ( [ limm ] ) we can solve for @xmath60 from eqs .",
    "( [ vp ] ) or ( [ vm ] ) by multiplying the first by @xmath61 or the second by @xmath62 .",
    "this yields @xmath63    substituting this back into eqns .",
    "( [ vpm ] ) , and defining @xmath64 , we find    @xmath65    these equations directly determine the displacements given the strength of the external driving , @xmath58 . to get a physical handle on the meaning of this constant",
    ", we note that eqns .",
    "( [ vpm ] ) can be directly solved for the leading behavior of @xmath66 as @xmath67 goes to @xmath68 , using the fact that in this limit , @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a constant , reflecting the arbitrariness in how we perform the decomposition of @xmath47 .",
    "we find    @xmath72    this is just the expected ( fourier transform of ) the singular solution of continuum elasticity as one approaches the crack tip .",
    "thus , as in all boundary - layer problems , the large - distance limit of the `` inner '' solution matches on to the short - distance limit of the `` outer '' solution , confirming the justification of the choice of @xmath21 above . we need to relate the strength of the short - distance singularity of the continuum solution to the driving displacement @xmath73 .",
    "this can be done directly by solving the continuum elastic equations .",
    "it is easier , however , to follow slepyan and derive this relation by energy considerations .",
    "one can calculate @xcite the flux of energy into the boundary - layer , or  process \" zone , obtaining @xmath74 now consider the flux of energy @xmath75 being used to break bonds , which is simply related to @xmath60 @xmath76 then , using the idea that the griffith s displacement is determined by exactly the condition that all the energy flux is needed just to break the bonds , we have @xmath77 notice that the factor of @xmath71 guarantees that the result is invariant with respect to how the decomposition of @xmath47 is performed .    in order to make contact with other treatments , we consider the standard case @xmath78 and @xmath79 , in which all bonds are equivalent . in this case , the function @xmath47 has a particularly simple form , @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 . we can represent these functions in term of the products over all their roots @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the ( nonzero ) roots of @xmath85(@xmath86 ) in the lower half plane and @xmath87 are corresponding roots of @xmath85(@xmath86 ) in the upper half plane .",
    "this decomposition allows us to write down explicitly the factors @xmath51 , @xmath52 :    @xmath88    examining the small @xmath67 behavior , we find the @xmath89 , so that substitution of @xmath51 into eqn .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) the one imaginary @xmath91 , which we will denote as @xmath92 , we get @xmath93 this formula was obtained by @xcite , who started from a finite lattice of transverse size @xmath94 and considered the @xmath95 limit .",
    "note that this can be done for @xmath78 on a square lattice , ( the case being considered here ) , but not for general @xmath8 or for modes i or iii on a triangular lattice ; the method here works for these cases as well @xcite .",
    "next , it is easy to see that in the limit @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 and that therefore @xmath98 furthermore , in this limit @xmath99 .",
    "all other complex roots cancel out , leaving only real roots .",
    "hence , @xmath100 a result originally obtained by slepyan .",
    "note that in our treatment , the presence of one of these real roots in either the numerator or the denominator of the product expression depends entirely on the half - plane from where it came as we took the limit @xmath96 .",
    "to see what this condition implies , let us denote by @xmath85(or @xmath86 ) as @xmath101 ; then the small imaginary part of a specific real root , @xmath102 , satisfies the equation @xmath103 which gives as the determining factor @xmath104 this condition is exactly what appears in slepyan s work .",

    ", we proceed as discussed in the last section for a similar semi - infinite integral ; this leaves us with having to integrate numerically a function which behaves as @xmath172 near infinity . finally ,",
    "for the integral near @xmath137 we add an integral with @xmath173 replaced by @xmath174 ; this added integral is done analytically and the resultant subtracted integral with the integrand now containing @xmath175 is done numerically .    applying the described procedure",
