    "<S> skyrmions are nanometric spin whirls that can be stabilized in magnets lacking inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of isolated skyrmions embedded in a ferromagnetic background have been intensively studied . </S>",
    "<S> we show that single skyrmions and clusters of skyrmions can also form in the helical phase and investigate theoretically their energetics and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the helical background provides natural one - dimensional channels along which a skyrmion can move rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to skyrmions in ferromagnets , the skymion - skyrmion interaction has a strong attractive component and thus skyrmions tend to form clusters with characteristic shapes . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters are directly observed in transmission electron microscopy measurements in thin films of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> topological quantization , high mobility and the confinement of skyrmions in channels provided by the helical background may be useful for future spintronics devices .    in crystals lacking inversion symmetry , subtle relativistic interactions lead to the formation of exotic spin textures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in chiral magnets such as cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , ferrimagnetically ordered spins spontaneously ca nt to form helixes with a pitch of @xmath2 nm @xcite . upon applying a tiny magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> lattices of stable magnetic whirls emerge @xcite . due to the nanometer confinement and sensitivity to electromagnetic control , </S>",
    "<S> these magnetic structures have potential for new spintronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the spin direction of a magnetic skyrmion wraps once around the unit sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the spin configuration can not be continuously deformed to another magnetic state i.e , skyrmions are topologically protected particles @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . therefore they can be created and destroyed only by singular magnetic configurations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for sufficiently small temperatures and magnetic fields , skyrmions can have practically an infinite lifetime @xcite . as a very smooth magnetic configuration , skyrmions couple only weakly to local defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , they couple extremely well to external forces . in metals and heterostructures , skyrmions can be manipulated by small electric or thermal currents @xcite while in magnetoelectric insulators they can be manipulated dissipationlessly with electric fields @xcite , heat currents @xcite , and laser pulses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , skyrmions are repelled from the edges of nanostructures and react very fast to external control @xcite .    from the application perspective , research has mainly focused on the manipulation of skyrmions in a ferromagnetic background . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it has been suggested to build memory devices @xcite based on skyrmions arranged in a nanowire where information is encoded in the distance between skyrmions . </S>",
    "<S> alternative designs use nanostructures with lanes for skyrmions where the information is stored in the lane number @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting alternative is to consider skyrmions in a helical background . </S>",
    "<S> this problem , first studied by ezawa @xcite , has , up to now , received little attention . </S>",
    "<S> such states naturally occur when the phase transition from the skyrmion crystal phase to the helical phase is investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that four major properties distinguish skyrmions in a helical background from their cousins in a ferromagnetic environment : ( i ) skyrmions naturally move along the tracks defined by the helical order . </S>",
    "<S> currents perpendicular to these naturally formed tracks are expected to drive skyrmions to very high speeds especially in materials with low gilbert damping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) in the helical phase , skyrmions are metastable even for vanishing magnetic field . in contrast , skyrmions in the ferromagnetic state require either a sufficiently strong external magnetic field or sufficiently strong easy - axis anisotropy to guarantee local stablility @xcite . ( </S>",
    "<S> iii ) while in the ferromagnetic state only one type of skyrmion is preferred by the background magnetization @xcite , in the helical phase skyrmions and antiskyrmions can coexist moving on different tracks in the helical background . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) while the skyrmion - skyrmion interaction is typically repulsive in the ferromagnetic case , there are strong attractive components in the helical phase which naturally lead to the formation of skyrmion dimers and larger skyrmion clusters .     </S>",
    "<S> +    in the following , we will first develop the theory of skyrmions in the helical phase , their interactions , and the formation of clusters of skyrmions . </S>",
    "<S> energies and magnetic fields will be measured in units of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these are set by the exchange coupling and the critical field stabilizing the ferromagnet , see the supplemental material . to observe these clusters experimentally , we acquired real space and real time movies of the helical - skyrmion phase transition in a thin film of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 using lorentz transmission electron microscopy ( ltem ) . </S>",
    "<S> the movies reveal the nucleation of skyrmions in the helical background and their tendency to arrange in clusters of different configurations .    _ single skyrmions in a helical phase : _ to investigate the energetics of skyrmions in a helical background , we performed micromagnetic simulations , see supplemental material @xcite . figure [ fig1 ] depicts the different skyrmion configurations : top panels represent single skyrmions and the characteristic skyrmion dimer . </S>",
    "<S> bottom panels show the different multiskyrmion cluster configurations . </S>",
    "<S> while the `` interstitial '' skyrmion in panel ( a ) resembles the well - known skyrmion in a ferromagnetic background , the h - shaped skyrmion of panel ( b ) can be viewed as a bound state of two half - skyrmions ( merons ) defined by the ends of a helical strip . </S>",
    "<S> an antiskyrmion ( panel ( c ) ) with opposite winding number can be obtained by time reversal . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( d ) represents the formation of a two - skyrmion dimer bound state due to the presence of attractive interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2](a ) shows the energetics of four configurations of skyrmions ( solid lines ) and the corresponding antiskyrmions ( dashed lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> blue and red lines represent the energetics of the `` interstitial '' and the h - shaped configuration , respectively , and the green lines describe the dimer state . </S>",
    "<S> the h - shaped state requires much less distortion of the helical background lattice and has a significantly lower energy than the interstitial state . </S>",
    "<S> however , both states have the same winding number @xcite and can be smoothly deformed into each other . for @xmath5 , skyrmions and antiskyrmions </S>",
    "<S> are degenerate but since each skyrmion configuration carries a finite magnetization , they split linearly in the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> above a critical field @xmath6 the energy of a single skyrmion becomes negative with respect to the pure helical background implying that above this field the system energetically favors the proliferation of skyrmions . </S>",
    "<S> the exact critical field for the phase transition to the skyrmion lattice is , however , slightly lower due to attractive interactions between skyrmions ( explained below ) .    by translational symmetry it costs no energy for a single skyrmion to move parallel to the track defined by the helical background . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a huge energy barrier of several exchange coupling constants ( per layer of the material ) prohibits the motion to the parallel lane as can be estimated from the large energy value of the interstitial skyrmion configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this confinement has also important consequences for the velocity of the skyrmion when it is driven by a spin - current perpendicular to the confining walls where we assume that the helix is pinned by disorder . in a ferromagnet , </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion would flow in the direction of the spin current with a velocity of the order of @xmath7 , the velocity characterizing the spin current @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the helical background acts as a confining potential@xcite and accordingly one finds a velocity of the order of @xmath8 , if @xmath7 has a component perpendicular to the track . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the gilbert damping constant , which can be smaller than @xmath10 in insulating materials like cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is somehow similar to a sailing boat which can obtain velocities larger than the velocity of the wind : in this analogy the keel of the boat takes over the role of the helical background .    _ </S>",
    "<S> interactions and cluster formation : _ skyrmion - skyrmion interactions determine the collective behavior of skyrmions and the nature of phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> attractive interactions , for example , induce the formation of bound states and clusters and render the phase transition into the skyrmion phase to be of first order . to investigate collective skyrmion states in the helical background , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xcite the skyrmion - skyrmion interaction potential @xmath11 for two skyrmions in the h - type configuration and the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> red and blue solid lines describe the potential for skyrmions on the same track and on neighboring tracks , respectively . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is characterized by a weak long - ranged repulsion and a much stronger short ranged attraction . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the formation of a bound state of two skyrmions , the dimer state depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also show the interaction potential for two skyrmions in a polarized background ( gray dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that this potential is purely repulsive , which is in sharp contrast to the situation in a helical background . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive potential in the helical background is strongest when the two skyrmions are on the same track ( n = 0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the attractive potential on neighboring tracks , @xmath12 , is only about 25% lower than on the same track , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal energy is thereby obtained for a relative displacement of the two skyrmions of about half the helical wavelength either to the right or to the left . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive skyrmion - skyrmion interaction implies that it is energetically favourable to form clusters of skyrmions . </S>",
    "<S> their energy can be estimated with high accuracy by adding the interaction potential of neighboring skyrmions . for @xmath14 , for example , we obtain from this simple estimate @xmath15 for the binding energy of three skyrmions in the same track , three skyrmions distributed on two tracks , and a 12-skyrmion cluster shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1](h ) . </S>",
    "<S> these values can be compared to @xmath16 obtained from direct minimization . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that similar results hold for @xmath17 .        _ </S>",
    "<S> experiments : _ to experimentally detect the different skyrmion configurations predicted above , we have investigated a 110 nm thin plate of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic textures were imaged using a cryo - ltem , see methods in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> the applied magnetic field and temperature of the sample were held constant at 33mt and 13k , respectively , such that the system is close to the phase transition between the helical and the skyrmion phase . </S>",
    "<S> we recorded several movies and analyze here a selected movie of 100 frames with an integration time of 125ms per frame . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a coexistence of helical and skyrmion domains which fluctuate with time , see supplemental material @xcite . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a - d ) represents a @xmath18  @xmath19m@xmath20 zoom of the total @xmath21  @xmath19m@xmath20 micrograph at four different time points . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly identify large regions dominated either by skyrmion crystals or the helical phase . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting feature here is the appearance of smaller clusters of skyrmions inside the helical phases . for clarity , </S>",
    "<S> we show a zoom of the real - space images marked by red squares in the lower panels ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](e - h ) ) . to highlight the different configurations of skyrmions , </S>",
    "<S> some of the helical regions are marked in red .    </S>",
    "<S> we can identify several frequently occurring defect clusters that can be related to the theoretical states shown in fig.[fig1](e)-(h ) . </S>",
    "<S> the configurations i forming a line of skyrmions correspond to the state shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e ) . also lines of dimers , </S>",
    "<S> compare fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](f ) , are often found and labeled by ii in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . averaging over several such configurations of i and ii </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the angle between the defect orientation and the ordering vector of the helix is given by @xmath22 for a line of skyrmions and @xmath23 for a line of dimers . </S>",
    "<S> this can be compared to @xmath24 and @xmath25 obtained within our simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find one further type of defect marked by iii in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] which can not be interpreted as a bound state of skyrmions in a given helical background . instead , in this `` zipper '' configuration the helical background on one side </S>",
    "<S> is shifted by half a lattice period . </S>",
    "<S> a simulation of such a structure is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](g ) . in our simulation the binding energy per skyrmion for this configuration </S>",
    "<S> is lowered by approximately @xmath26 compared to the skyrmion line of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e ) which implies that long defects of type i may transform into defects of type iii . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe all types of irregularly shaped clusters denoted by iv in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to compare the formation of skyrmions in the helical and the ferromagnetic state . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> skyrmion - skyrmion interactions are repulsive @xcite and therefore no formation of skyrmion clusters is expected . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked this by performing experiments at magnetic fields of 100mt to 150mt , where only skyrmions in a ferromagnetic background occur . as expected , </S>",
    "<S> no cluster formation was observed by us , see supplemental material @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also observe regions where the image is blurred at the location of defects . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this effect arises from the motion of defects . assuming a gilbert damping of the order of @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the 1d diffusion constant of a cluster of @xmath27 skyrmions @xcite in the absence of defects to be of the order of @xmath28m@xmath20/s . within the capturing time of a frame of our movie ( @xmath29 ) </S>",
    "<S> a freely moving cluster can therefore move distances of the order of @xmath30 @xmath19 m . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is consistent with large fluctuations which we see from frame to frame captured within our movie . </S>",
    "<S> sharply resolved images correspond to clusters which are temporarily bound to defects presumably arising either from lattice defects or height variations of our films .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions : _ while sharing the same topology , skyrmions embedded in a helical or a ferromagnetic environment have very different properties . </S>",
    "<S> our studies highlight one aspect of this : attractive interactions in the helical background let skymions arrange in lines and clusters . these lines and clusters have characteristic shapes and orientations which we identified both in our micromagnetic simulations and electron microscopy experiments . from the viewpoint of application , skyrmions in a helical background </S>",
    "<S> are potentially attractive since the helical stripes provide natural lanes along which skyrmions can be driven fast . </S>",
    "<S> however , one has to avoid the formation of zipper configuration which can , for example , be achieved in nanowires of suitable dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the energy barrier for passing skyrmions between parallel lanes could be controlled for example with tailored light pulses or electric fields and will be explored in future experiments .    </S>",
