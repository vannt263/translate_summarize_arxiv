    "the optical properties of a medium can be drastically modified by strong coherent interaction with a laser field , and one of the most prominent examples of the kind is electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , which allows light transmission with large dispersion and gives rise to fascinating phenomena , such as extremely slow group velocity and light storage @xcite . besides extensive investigations of the temporal dynamics ,",
    "the spatial effects resulting from eit have also been studied such as the focusing and de - focusing of transmitted probe light in the presence of a strongly focused coupling beam @xcite and the deflection of probe light when passing through an eit medium in the presence of a magnetic field gradient @xcite .",
    "recently , cancellation of optical diffraction was obtained for a specific detuning of the probe beam where the doppler - dicke effect compensates for diffraction @xcite .",
    "while studies of eit generally focus on @xmath0 type energy level configurations , more recently , there has been considerable interest with eit in a ladder scheme involving rydberg energy levels @xcite ( rygberg eit ) .",
    "strong dipolar interaction between rydberg atoms in such eit schemes is responsible for the so - called photon blockade , which offers promising means to realize deterministic single photon sources @xcite , to induce effective interactions between photons @xcite , and to realize photonic phase gates @xcite .",
    "rydberg eit has also attracted attention with the demonstration of interaction enhanced absorption imaging ( ieai ) @xcite .",
    "this imaging technique detects rydberg excitations via their modification on eit transparency due to the strong interaction between rydberg atoms .",
    "it confers great potential for the study of many - body physics with rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "rydberg eit experiments generally require strongly focused coupling fields in order to obtain sufficiently strong rabi frequencies on the transition involving the rydberg state .",
    "this focusing inevitably produces strongly inhomogeneous coupling fields .",
    "while lensing effect on the probe field associated with this inhomogeneity has been studied using a hot vapour @xcite , until now this effect in cold rydberg ensembles has received little attention . however , since the probe field is to be strongly modified by interaction induced nonlinearity in cold rydberg ensembles , having a good understanding and control of the lensing effect is necessary .",
    "we present in this paper a precise study of the lensing effect on the probe light by a tightly focused coupling beam in a rydberg eit scheme and its dependence on the probe detuning .",
    "in contrast to most previous studies on rydberg eit , the spatial structures are imaged in our experiment by a diffraction limited optical system .",
    "we use @xmath1 rydberg state of @xmath2rb atoms so that the effect of interaction between rydberg atoms is minimal hence the experimental results can be accurately compared with numerical solutions of maxwell - bloch equations .",
    "this study sets clear delimitation on the possibilities offered by rydberg eit .",
    "the preparation of an ultracold @xmath2rb atomic sample for our experiment starts with loading a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) from a zeeman - slowed atomic beam , followed by further molasses cooling of the atomic cloud .",

    "the population in @xmath3 state is controlled by de - pumping a certain fraction of atoms into @xmath4 level during this optical pumping stage .",

    "the spot in the middle of each image is the transmitted probe light through eit area while the uniform background indicates the absorption level of probe light by the atomic cloud with absence of the coupling light .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the intensity of the transmitted probe light at the red probe detuning @xmath75 is enhanced while the intensity on the blue side with a detuning @xmath76 is reduced , compared with the incoming probe intensity , which is about the same as the intensity of the transmitted probe beam on resonance ( @xmath77 in fig .",
    "[ pic ] ) .",
    "moveover , the spot size of the red - detuned probe light is smaller than that of the blue - detuned with a similar @xmath78 .",
    "both the intensity and the size indicate the focusing of the red - detuned probe light and the defocusing of the blue - detuned one , since , if not due to the lensing effect , the transmitted spots would have similar intensity and size at detunings symmetric with respect to the resonance . it should be noted that the dark ring around the bright transmitted spots is not due to the lensing effect .",
    "instead , it comes from the spatially varying coupling rabi frequency as a result of the gaussian intensity profile of the coupling beam .",
    "this spatial dependent rabi frequency gives rise to a larger autler - townes splitting at the center of the coupling beam and smaller ones towards the edge of the beam .",
    "consequently , the transmitted spot of on - resonance probe light ( @xmath77 in fig .  [ pic ] ) has the largest size , since there is no autler - townes enhanced absorption throughout the whole eit area , whereas the transmitted spots of off - resonance probe light have smaller sizes with surrounding dark rings due to enhanced absorption at autler - townes splitting frequencies .",
    "because of this change of transmitted spot size vs. detuning , the focusing ( defocusing ) of the red ( blue)- detuned probe light can not be defined relative to the transmitted probe beam on resonance , but should rather be defined relative to the transmitted probe beam at that particular detuning with no lensing effect . in the experimental observation of fig .  [ pic ] where the lensing effect is present , this can only be acknowledged by comparing the transmitted probe beam size and intensity at the detunings symmetric with respect to the resonance .    in order to obtain eit transmission spectra , the transmission of the probe light is extracted by taking the ratio between the probe intensity at the center of such images ( @xmath79 ) and that of the incoming probe beam without the atomic cloud ( @xmath80 ) . the transmission spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] are generated by plotting the probe transmission ( @xmath81 ) as a function of the probe detunings @xmath19 for atomic densities and coupling beam sizes detailed in the figure caption .",
    "as expected , there is a transparency spectral window near the probe resonance due to the coherent interaction between the coupling light and atoms , and the two absorption peaks are from the autler - townes splitting .",
    "the lensing effect within this transparency spectral range can be clearly seen from the greatly enhanced transmission at the red detuning @xmath82 0 and the somewhat reduced transmission at the blue detuning @xmath83 0 .",
    "this enhanced transmission at the red detuning highly depends on the atomic density @xmath84 and the coupling beam size @xmath33 . with the same coupling beam size @xmath33 and the same peak rabi frequency @xmath44 , the atomic cloud with a higher density in fig .",
