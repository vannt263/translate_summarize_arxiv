    "it is well known that criticality in simple fluids with short - range potentials can be described by the ising universality class with critical exponents accessible via renormalization group calculations @xcite . however , for coulomb systems , where particles interact through long - range potentials , the nature of criticality remains open to question @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical , experimental and computational investigations of electrolyte systems have not yet produced a clear picture of the thermodynamics in the critical region .",
    "early experiments on criticality in electrolytes suggested a strong dichotomy : namely , some electrolytes @xcite , termed solvophobic and typically having large solvent dielectric constant , are satisfactorily characterized by ising critical exponents .",
    "this suggests , that the principal interactions driving the phase separation in such systems are of short - range character . on the other hand , a number of organic salts in appropriate solvents , typically of low dielectric constant , were found to exhibit classical or close - to - classical behavior @xcite , and have been called coulombic , stressing the importance of the dominant electrostatic interactions .",
    "moreover , in sodium - ammonia solutions @xcite ( and some other systems : see @xcite and references therein ) , crossover from classical to ising behavior had been observed , but at a reduced temperature @xmath0 , unusually close to the critical point .",
    "this led to the idea @xcite that the true asymptotic critical behavior of ionic fluids is always of ising character but that crossover from nonasymptotic , close - to - classical behavior occurs at scales that may sometimes be experimentally inaccessible @xcite .",
    "monte carlo computer simulations provide another useful method of investigating the properties of ionic systems . in the last decade",
    "substantial progress has been achieved in this field , with primary effort focused on the coexistence curves @xcite .",
    "however , some special attention has also been devoted to the heat capacity which is significant for elucidating the critical region @xcite . nevertheless , because of the long - range character of the interactions and the low values of the critical temperatures , which lead to many strongly bound ion pairs @xcite , computer simulations for finite systems still lack the ability to clearly determine critical exponents and hence to identify the nature of the criticality .",
    "the success of the renormalization group ( rg ) approach in describing non - ionic fluids @xcite suggests that it might also be applied to coulombic criticality .",
    "however , to implement an rg treatment , the existence of a physically well based mean - field theory turns out to be crucial @xcite .",
    "the simplest model for theoretical investigations of ionic systems is the so called restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , which considers particles of equal sizes and positive and negative charges of equal magnitude .",
    "two main theoretical approaches have emerged .",
    "the first employs an extension @xcite of the basic debye - hckel ( dh ) theory @xcite , developed in the early 20th century for dilute solutions of strong electrolytes .",
    "the second approach rests on integral equations for correlation functions , typically employing the ornstein - zernike equations in combination with some truncation , as in the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) @xcite .",
    "neither of these two approaches has any known independent basis , such as an overall variational principle for the ionic free energy , that might help justify its reliability .",
    "however , compared to the values predicted by dh - based treatments , msa - based theories yield relatively poor agreement with the critical parameters found by current monte carlo simulations , namely , in reduced units @xcite , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to 0.085 .",
    "careful analysis @xcite , utilizing thermodynamic energy bounds , etc . , also suggests that dh - based theories promise a better description of the critical region of model electrolytes .",
    "since the ising model , which is equivalent to a lattice gas , has played a crucial role in understanding critical phenomena in non - ionic systems , lattice models of electrolytes deserve attention .",
    "although clearly artificial as regards the description of real ionic solutions , which possess continuous rather than discrete spatial symmetry , they are attractive for various reasons . first , by virtue of the lattice character one can incorporate the behavior of dense phases , at least one of which should be an ordered ionic crystal .",
    "lattice models may also be effective for describing defects in real crystals @xcite .",
    "second , even finely discretized lattice systems present a computational advantage over their continuous - space counterparts in monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "last but not the least , discrete - state lattice models facilitate the derivation of equivalent field - theoretical descriptions and , thereby , the study of the significance of various terms in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , coulomb interactions can be exactly represented in terms of a nearest - neighbor hamiltonian via the sine - gordon transformation that yields both low fugacity and high - temperature expansions of the equation of state .",
    "( for a recent overview and results see ref.@xcite and references therein . )    despite their distinct theoretical advantages , lattice models of electrolytes have not been studied systematically .",
    "the aim of the work reported below has been to repair this omission .    most of the previous analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite work on lattice ionic systems has addressed the question of tricriticality and of order - disorder transitions .",
    "while the overall density is the order parameter which suffices to reveal gas - liquid critical behavior in ionic solution , the presence of an underlying lattice allows naturally for the appearance of another order parameter . in bipartite lattices , such as the simple cubic ( sc ) and body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattices , ions of opposite charges can distribute unequally between the sublattices , thereby reducing the electrostatic part of the free energy . at the same time , the entropy is also reduced which increase the free energy .",
    "this competition leads to the appearance of a phase with long - range order resembling an ionic crystal ; second - order phase transitions are then a likely consequence . in the continuum case",
    "analogous oscillations appear in the charge - charge correlation functions @xcite at certain values of density - temperature ratio .",
    "however , such ordered phases may turn out to be thermodynamically so stable , that a gas - liquid phase transition predicted by a continuum theory may not survive in a lattice model : the lattice system tends to `` solidify '' before forming a `` proper '' liquid .",
    "indeed , this scenario has been observed in numerical studies . on the other hand ,",
    "the possible presence of both gas - liquid and tricritical points has been predicted theoretically by ciach and stell for a model with additional short - range interactions added to the lattice coulomb forces @xcite .",
    "as indicated , we present in this article a study of the simplest , single - site hard core model of lattice ionic system with charges @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the basic dh theory on general , @xmath4-dimensional bravais lattices .",
    "our analysis focuses on @xmath5 in sec .",
    "iii . after presenting the results for pure dh theory ,",
    "the crucial phenomenon of bjerrum ion pairing is introduced in sec .",
    "iii.b ; but , following fisher and levin @xcite , this must be supplemented by explicit dipole - ion solvation effects : see sec .",
    "iii.c . then , in sec .",
    "iv the possibility of sublattice charge ordering is discussed .",
    "unlike previous treatments @xcite , we account for both electrostatic screening and sublattice ordering in a unified framework .",
    "our conclusions are summarized briefly in sec .",
    "our derivation for general @xmath4-dimensional lattices follows closely the debye - hckel approach @xcite . we confine ourselves to the lattice restricted primitive model ( lrpm ) , which consists of oppositely charged ions with charges @xmath6 and @xmath7 which occupy single lattice sites of a @xmath4-dimensional bravais lattice . in this simplest model the ions interact only through the electrostatic field and",
    "otherwise behave as ideal particles , subject only to on - site exclusion .",
    "thus the total free energy density , which plays the central role in the thermodynamics of the system , can be written @xmath8 .",
    "as the overall system must be neutral , the average densities of the positive and negative ions are equal : @xmath9 .",
    "correspondingly , for the reduced chemical potential and pressure @xcite we have @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the ideal lattice gas contribution to the free energy is , up to a constant term , given by @xmath13 with the corresponding chemical potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total lattice volume while @xmath16 is the reduced dimensionless density of ( free ) ions and @xmath17 is the volume per site of the lattice .",
    "next we determine the contribution to free energy arising from the coulombic interactions .",
    "however , the lattice form of the potential , which takes into account the discreteness of the space , should be used .",
    "this lattice coulomb potential will approach the continuous @xmath18 potential asymptotically at large distances , but it differs significantly at small distances .",
    "we start with the linearized lattice poisson - boltzmann equation , which determines the average electrostatic potential at point @xmath19 . following the standard dh approach @xcite",
    ", we easily find @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inverse debye screening length , with @xmath22 .",
    "the constant factor @xmath23 is determined by the dimensionality of the lattice system @xcite . in this equation",

    "the lattice function @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 in the dh approach , we need only the potential felt by an ion fixed at the origin due to all the surrounding ions . because of the bravais symmetry",

    ", the possibility of phase transitions and criticality can be investigated by analyzing the spinodals , and the phase coexistence curves may be obtained by the matching pressure and chemical potential in coexisting phases .",
    "spinodals are specified by setting the inverse isothermal compressibility @xmath45 to zero , so that @xmath46 which , on taking ( [ mu.pure ] ) into account , reduces to @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "one can show that when @xmath49 becomes large ( which corresponds to @xmath50 ) , one has @xmath51 .",
    "eqs.([f.el])-([spinodal.d ] ) can be used to investigate the phase behavior of electrolytes in any dimension .",
    "we mention briefly here the critical parameters obtained for @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the one - dimensional case",
    "the lattice green s function gives @xmath54 which yields a spinodal of the form @xmath55 } , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;   x=\\kappa a.\\ ] ] this specifies a critical point with parameters @xmath56 in accordance with the general principle that one - dimensional systems do not display phase transitions .",
    "however , since @xmath57 in a one - dimensional system , the dh method fails and describing the one - dimensional ionic lattice model demands a different approach : one may note the continuum analysis @xcite .    for @xmath58 dimensions",
    "the lattice green s functions are given in ref . @xcite .",
    "then for both for triangular and square lattices the predicted critical parameters are found to be @xmath59 precisely , the same values as for the continuum model @xcite .",
    "let us now examine @xmath60 cubic lattices in more detail .",
    "we address three cases : simple cubic ( sc ) , body centered cubic ( bcc ) and face centered cubic ( fcc ) ; for convenience their geometrical parameters are listed in table [ table.3dlat ] .",
    ".lattice parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this completes the principal task and allows the construction of coexistence curves : these are shown in fig .",
    "2 . clearly , in the lattice models the dipole - ion interactions are also crucial to repair the unphysical banana - like form produced by bjerrum association alone .",
    "the numerical estimates are presented in table iii . for comparison ,",
    "the predictions of continuum - space dhbjdi theory and of the rpm simulations are also listed .",
    "the predicted lattice critical temperatures are now 1.5 - 1.65 times greater than the value given by the simulations and the theoretical results of levin and fisher @xcite .",
    "the critical densities , however , are quite close to the continuum model predictions , but are significantly lower than the simulations @xcite .",
    "so far we have dealt only with an intrinsically low - density picture of the system .",
    "our description of the dense phases , although partially represented by the liquid side of the coexistence curve , has been seriously incomplete . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice theories provide a particularly natural first approach to studying ordering in solid phases .",
    "indeed , the question of principal interest for us will be the possibility of ordering similar to that observed in ionic crystals .",
    "we will , in fact , find that a dh - based theory yields a phase diagram with no gas - liquid criticality but , rather a tricritical point @xcite .",
    "let us start by considering a general @xmath4-dimensional bipartite lattice , that can be divided into two sublattices of the same form .",
    "suppose , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the numbers of positive and negative ions on sublattice @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , subject to the neutrality constraint @xmath67 .",
    "consider the sublattice with an excess of positive ions ( say , `` @xmath65 '' for the definiteness ) , and define the corresponding order parameter by @xmath68 this will have a vanishing mean value in a disordered phase but will be positive in an appropriately ordered phase .",
    "the entropic part of the free energy density corresponds to ideal ions and is thus now given by @xmath69 .\\ ] ] to estimate the electrostatic part of the free energy , the extended dh approach @xcite suggests that we begin with an inhomogeneous version of poisson s equation for the potential at a general site @xmath19 due to all the ions when an ion of type @xmath70 is fixed at the origin : this states @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the bulk density of ions of species @xmath73 while @xmath74 is the ion - ion correlation function .",
    "approximating the correlation functions by simple boltzmann factors and then linearizing provides a dh equation .",
    "however , we must now allow for an overall nonzero charge density on each sublattice given by @xmath75 these charge densities generate an additional `` background '' potential , @xmath76 , which does not contribute to the correlation functions since it is independent of what type of charge is placed at the origin . for sublattice @xmath65 we thus have a linearized poisson - boltzmann or dh equation @xmath77 recalling the definition of the lattice laplacian ( [ lat.lap ] ) , and taking into account the symmetry between the sublattices we have @xmath78 and conclude that the background potentials are @xmath79    if we now put @xmath80 and accept the approximation @xmath81 in ( [ eq.or ] ) , the equation for the local induced potential @xmath82 reduces to the lattice version of pure dh theory ( [ linpb ] ) .",
    "this reflects the electrostatic superposition principle , i.e. , the total potential is simply the sum of a `` background '' potential due to nonzero average charge density and the dh screening potential so that @xmath83 now , following the dh approach combined with a mean - field description of the ordering , we find the potential @xmath84 due to all ions except the one fixed at the origin to be @xmath85 , \\\\",

    "this can be found by computing @xmath102 with @xmath98 defined by ( [ y.order ] ) , equating to zero and setting @xmath103 after taking the derivative .",
    "a more readily justifiable , but also somewhat more sophisticated procedure is to study the stability matrix for the free energy , which is now a function of two order parameters , namely , @xmath98 and @xmath49 .",
    "both methods lead to the same equation for tricritical point , which reads @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the lattice green s function ( [ latgreen ] ) .      in @xmath5 dimensions simple cubic and body centered cubic lattices",
    "are bipartite and sublattice ordering is possible .",
    "note , that the calculations presented above did not use any extra properties of lattice symmetry .",
    "indeed , the electrostatic interaction energy of the `` charged '' sublattices depends only on the excess charge density , that is on @xmath98 , and is thus the same for both lattices .",
    "this is also true as regards the entropy of sublattice ordering .",
    "we find that the tricritical point parameters are @xmath106 while the @xmath100-lines may be written @xmath107 the full predicted phase diagrams are presented in fig .",
    "3 .    ( 4.5,3.5 )    it is instructive to compare our results with previous simulations for the sc lattice @xcite .",
    "these yield @xmath108 which is only about 40% of our theoretical estimates ( [ tri ] ) . on the other hand , for the tricritical density the higher estimate @xmath109 of ref .",
    "@xcite is probably more reliable than @xmath110 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( which compares rather well with our theoretical values ) , since the former simulations used larger lattice sizes and computed more points on the coexistence curve .",
    "it must also be noted , however , that both these simulations employed the discretized continuum or @xmath18 coulombic potential in place of the lattice form we have used .",
    "fitting a straight line at low @xmath111 to the @xmath100-line data of stell and dickman @xcite yields a slope @xmath112 which may be compared with our value of 1.047 .",
    "( for another comparison one might note that the generalized dh theory for the continuum rpm @xcite predicts damped charge - density oscillations setting in on a locus @xmath113 while undamped oscillations are predicted beyond the locus @xmath114 . )    also of interest is the value of @xmath115 at close packing , i.e. , @xmath116 . for the sc lattice our treatment predicts @xmath117 which , by virtue of the mean - field character of the theory , is likely to be a significant overestimate .",
    "indeed , extrapolation of the dickman - stell data suggests @xmath118 while almarza and enciso @xcite obtain @xmath119 ; but , again , these simulations employ a discretized @xmath18 potential .",
    "our analysis indicates higher values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 for the bcc lattice than for the sc .",
    "but , perhaps , surprisingly , this is just the opposite of what almarza and enciso find @xcite .",
    "in addition to using the lattice coulomb potential , our treatment at this point has neglected the formation of bjerrum ion pairs .",
    "in fact , it seems quite feasible to include pairing in the theory along with allowance for sublattice ordering ( since the ions of a dimer pair will reside on complementary sublattices ) .",
    "it is possible that this improvement of the theory will result in lower transition temperatures for the bcc lattice relative to the sc lattice .",
    "previous theoretical discussions of the sc lattice rpm have been presented by stell and colleagues @xcite . in an initial mean field approach @xcite , the long - range coulomb potential ( taken in discretized @xmath18 form )",
    "was first reduced to an effective nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "the value of the tricritical temperature , @xmath122 , obtained by direct mean - field lattice calculations , was then scaled down by a factor derived by comparing energy magnitudes .",
    "this approach suggested @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the latter value being merely a consequence of using a nearest - neighbor mean - field approximation .",
    "more recently , ciach and stell @xcite have adopted a single - ion lattice potential , as , in fact , given by ( [ phiofr ] ) and ( [ phiofa ] ) .",
    "this corresponds more closely to our treatment but they entirely neglect the cooperative screening which must occur and which is included in our dh - based treatment .",
    "( note that at higher densities the screening effectively takes place via `` holes '' in the ordered or close - to ordered lattice charge configurations ) . the new treatment",
    "@xcite reproduces @xmath124 ( for the previous reasons ) but gives @xmath125 , which is worse than the previous result as compared with the simulations ; however , no energy rescaling is now performed .    as we have seen , both by our own theoretical analysis and through the simulations , the sc and bcc pure coulomb lattice systems display _ no _ gas - liquid phase separation as such .",
    "indeed , in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the coexistence curves for the two lattices that are predicted by pure lattice dh theory with no allowance for the possibility of sublattice ordering . evidently , these coexistence curves lie entirely within the two - phase coexistence region of dilute disordered vapor and the high density ordered `` crystal '' .",
    "consequently , the order - disorder transition entirely suppresses gas - liquid criticality in the simplest discrete ionic system with only _ single - site _ hard cores .",
    "if , instead , the hard - core repulsions extend over more lattice sites  or , equivalently , if a finer level of spatial discretization is employed ( as , of course , is more - realistic for continuum systems )  then , as revealed by simulations @xcite , a normal gas - liquid transition and critical point is restored . at the same time , ordered , crystal - like phases appear only at relatively higher densities as characteristic of real solids .",
    "while a dh ( or , even , a dhbjdi ) theory might be attempted for a more finely discretized model , the clearly evident complications do _ not _ make this a promising prospect . on the other hand , by adding to a purely ionic lattice system strong short - range attractive potentials ( say , designed to represent neutral solvent properties @xcite ) , more elaborate phase diagrams can be anticipated .",
    "indeed , by approximations that again neglect all screening effects , systems displaying _ both _ a tricritical point and a normal critical point have been obtained @xcite .",
    "our more complete treatment could readily be extended in the same spirit .",
    "by solving exactly lattice versions of the usual debye - hckel equation , we have derived closed expressions for the free energy of general , @xmath4-dimensional ionic lattice systems with single - site hard core repulsions . for @xmath126 ,",
    "gas - liquid transitions are predicted at low temperatures and densities . as in the corresponding dh - based theory for",
    "the continuum restricted primitive model @xcite , improvement of the theory at low temperatures demands both allowance for @xmath127 ion pairing , to form nearest - neighbor dipolar dimers , _ and _ the solvation of the resulting dipolar pairs by the residual free ions .",
    "the predicted critical temperatures for the sc , bcc and fcc lattices in @xmath5 dimensions then lie @xmath128 higher than given by continuum dh - based theories ; but the critical densities are relatively closer .",
    "these results accord with the general tendency of lattice theories to overestimate the stability of the corresponding low - temperature continuum phases .    at higher densities in a lattice theory",
    "it is imperative to allow for sublattice ordering of the positive and negative ions . by introducing an appropriate order parameter",
    "we have extended analysis to treat general , @xmath4-dimensional bipartite lattices at a _ combined _ debye - hckel and mean - field ordering level . our unified theory yields , in an accord with recent lattice simulations , a complete suppressiion of gas - liquid phase separation and criticality by order - disorder transitions that occur at higher temperatures . at high densities and temperatures",
    "a classical second - order @xmath100-line is predicted ; but this terminates at a _",
    "tricritical _ point at a density , for the sc and bcc lattices , @xmath129 and a temperature , @xmath130 . at lower temperatures",
    "the first - order transition is from an exponentially dilute vapor to an almost close - packed ordered ionic lattice .",
    "our treatment can be extended in various directions .",
    "indeed , there are preliminary indications that by considering strongly anisotropic three - dimensional lattices , gas - liquid separation may be restored , possibly , together with distinct order - disorder transitions .",
    "it is relevant to note in this connection that dh theory for continuum ionic systems predicts _ increasing _ values of gas - liquid critical temperatures when the dimensionality is decreased @xcite .",
    "thus lattice anisotropy might mimic lower dimensionality .",

    "iv may prove helpful in describing the behavior of defects in ionic crystals @xcite .",
