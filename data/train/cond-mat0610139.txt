    "the relationship between superconductivity and magnetism has been a central issue in strongly correlated electron systems including heavy - electron ( he ) , cuprate , ruthenate and organic superconductors .",
    "the superconducting ( sc ) state of these systems develops , to varying extents , in the proximity of a magnetically ordered phase , and thus magnetic fluctuations have been believed to mediate ( or at least play an important role in ) the cooper pairing .",
    "one of the characteristic features seen in the he superconductors is perhaps that the sc state occurs clearly under magnetically ( or some other ) ordered phases . here ,",
    "f electrons take part in both the orders . limiting to pure ( undoped ) compounds and ambient pressure ,",
    "such cases have been discussed in the antiferromagnets with relatively large staggered moments ( upd@xmath9al@xmath10 @xcite , uni@xmath9al@xmath10 @xcite , cept@xmath10si @xcite ) , a very weak ( probably short - range - ordered ) antiferromagnet ( upt@xmath10 @xcite ) , a ferromagnet ( urhge @xcite ) and a so - called hidden order ( ho ) compound ( @xcite ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus our attention on , and report on our latest high - pressure studies .",
    "the experimental results obtained demonstrate that the superconductivity of this compound coexists with ho , but not with the af order induced by applying pressure . we also show that the weak antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism , both observed around ho , are extrinsic to the ho and sc states .    is crystallized in the thcr@xmath9si@xmath9 type structure with space group i4/mmm .",
    "the ho mentioned above occurs at @xmath1 17.5 k , where a portion of the fermi surface disappears due to a gap opening , which is indicated by , for example , a reduction of the linear specific - heat coefficient from @xmath11 mj / k@xmath12mol at @xmath13 to @xmath14 mj / k@xmath12mol at @xmath15 k @xcite . in 1987 , broholm et al . found from elastic neutron - scattering ( ns ) experiments that the 5f magnetic moments of u ions order at around , with a propagation vector @xmath16 @xcite . the moments align along the @xmath17 direction with a saturation value of @xmath1 0.03 /u . the 5f electrons on the remnant fermi surface further undergo the sc transition at @xmath1 1.2 k. therefore , in the early stage of investigation this system was regarded as a he compound where superconductivity coexists with a weak af ordering .",
    "however , the internal fields which should be generated by the af order were not detected in @xmath18si - nmr @xcite and @xmath19sr measurements @xcite .",
    "this might imply that the order is short range with fluctuating moments , but such an interpretation is inconsistent with the fact that a very sharp anomaly is seen in various macroscopic quantities at , particularly the mean - field like behavior of @xmath20 with a large entropy reduction of @xmath21 .",
    "( this provides a remarkable contrast to the weak af order of upt@xmath10 , where the order is characterized by the moments of similar magnitude , but not accompanied by any macroscopic anomaly at its onset temperature @xmath1 5 k. )    to resolve this contradiction , so far a variety of theoretical models have been put forward .",
    "they can be classified into two groups depending on whether the order parameter ( op ) is ( a ) a magnetic dipole @xmath22 @xcite or ( b ) some other degree of freedom @xmath23 @xcite . in the former group ,",
    "the af order is regarded as intrinsic and the models involve a mechanism for decreasing the effective @xmath24 value to account for the difference between and @xmath25 . on the other hand",
    ", the models of the group b assume the af order to be basically unnecessary for freezing the primary op . in this case",
    ", the af order further admits of two different interpretations : ( b1 ) _ a secondary order _ induced by the development of @xmath26 , and ( b2 ) a _ second phase _",
    "independent of ( or competing with ) the ho .",
    "it is thus very important to clarify the origin of the weak af order , to identify the hidden op .",
    "in 1999 , we performed elastic and inelastic ns measurements on under hydrostatic pressure , and observed that the af bragg scattering intensity @xmath27 is significantly enlarged by roughly 100 times with increasing pressure @xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure is unchanged , and estimated reaches @xmath1 0.39 /u at 1.5 k for @xmath28 2 gpa .",
    "the ns measurements , however , provide magnetic signals averaged over the crystal volume , i.e. , @xmath29 @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the af volume fraction and the true magnitude of the staggered moment , respectively .",
    "nmr can distinguish these two quantities , and matsuda et al .",
    "established from their high-@xmath33 @xmath18si - nmr measurements that what varies with pressure is not @xmath32 but @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "our succeeding zero - field @xmath19sr measurements also shown that the af and the seemingly non - magnetic ho phases are distributed in separate regions of the crystal @xcite .",
    "motoyama et al .",
    "provided the thermodynamical evidence for the presence of the @xmath33-induced phase transition by measuring the coefficients of linear thermal expansion on a single crystal under hydrostatic pressure @xcite .",
    "they observed that the @xmath34 ratio exhibits a significant increase when the system enters into the high-@xmath33 af phase .",
    "they also showed that the location of the phase boundary line between the ho and af phases sensitively depends on the sample quality .    in parallel",
    ", we performed the ns measurements under uniaxial stress @xmath35 , and observed that @xmath27 increases only when @xmath35 is applied along the basal @xmath17 plane @xcite . from the detailed strain analyses on both the @xmath33 and @xmath35 effects",
    ", we proposed that the axial strain @xmath36 is the key parameter to drive the ho - to - af transition .",
    "the critical value of @xmath37 is estimated to be very small ( @xmath38 ) , implying that the heterogeneously ordered state observed may be ascribed to a weak distribution of strain in a crystal .",
    "recently , bourdarot et al . also presented a @xmath33-@xmath8 phase diagram based on the high-@xmath33 ns measurements performed by using a hydrostatic helium cell as well as a clump - type pressure cell @xcite .",
    "they determined the first - order phase transition temperature as a midpoint of the increase in @xmath39 , and suggest that the first - order phase boundary line may have a critical end point , not meeting the second order phase boundary line @xmath40 .",
    "they consider the symmetry of op to be unchanged by pressure , and call the low and high-@xmath33 phases the small - moment and large - moment af phases , respectively .",
    "they also reported that the transition was sharpened by using the helium pressure cell .",
    "through these high-@xmath33 studies , one can safely say that undergoes a first - order phase transition by applying @xmath33 and @xmath35 at low temperature .",
    "however , at least the following three points remain unclear .",
    "first , there is an inevitable debate on whether the first - order phase boundary line terminates at a critical end point or a bicritical point : topology of the @xmath33-@xmath8 phase diagram is very important for analyzing the symmetry of op as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is unclear how the sc state behaves under pressure . in an earlier experiment ,",
    "it was reported that linearly decreases with increasing @xmath33 , but still remains finite at @xmath28 1.2 gpa @xcite , where we now know the af phase to be dominant . on the other hand , very recently uemura et al .",
    "have presented a new @xmath33-@xmath8 phase diagram based on thermal expansion and ac - susceptibility measurements , and suggested that the superconductivity does not coexist with the high-@xmath33 af phase @xcite .",
    "the third question has also been raised by their new phase diagram : the nature of a weak ferromeganetic ( fm ) phase developing below @xmath1 35 k. the phenomenon itself has been known for a long time , but they found that its onset temperature decreases with @xmath33 and shows a tendency to merge into the nel temperature above @xmath1 1 gpa .    in short ,",
    "those three issues require further investigation to obtain the correct @xmath33-@xmath8 phase diagram of this system . a major difficulty to do this arises from the strong dependence of the @xmath33-induced phenomena on the sample and pressure quality , which prevents us from comparing simply the experimental data taken for different samples and/or different pressure conditions .",
    "we now adopt the same combination of a sample and a pressure cell throughout our investigation to obtain a reliable phase diagram .",
    "a cylindrical single crystal was grown in a tetra - arc furnace under a pure argon atmosphere by the czochralski method .",
    "the dimensions of the grown crystal were about 25 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter ( the cylindrical axis was parallel to the @xmath17 axis ) .",
    "the crystal was cleaved along the @xmath17 plane to a 6-mm - long cylinder to fit a pressure cell used for the present study , and subsequently annealed for 7 days at 1000 @xmath41c .",
    "no spark - erosion process was applied .",
    "ns measurements were performed on the general purpose triple - axis spectrometer ( gptas ) installed at the beam port 4 g of the jrr-3 m reactor in japan atomic energy agency .",
    "pyrolytic graphite pg(002 ) crystals were used as a monochromator and an analyzer .",
    "elastic scans were made down to 1.5 k under several pressures up to 1.07 gpa , with a neutron wavelength @xmath42 = 2.334  and a 40-40-40-80 horizontal collimation .",
    "higher - order reflections were suppressed by using two 40-mm - thick pg filters .",
    "hydrostatic pressure was applied by using a cu - be clamp cell ( length 25 mm , inner diameter 2.6 mm , outer diameter 10 mm ) with fluorinert 70 & 77 pressure - transmitting medium .",
    "the applied pressure was monitored in situ by measuring the ac susceptibility on the superconducting transition of a small piece of lead , which was encapsulated together with the sample in the pressure cell . for the ac susceptibility measurements ,",
    "the standard hartshorn - bridge technique was used with an external ac field of @xmath1 1 oe ( peak to peak ) and 70 hz .",
    "the coaxial coils were wounded on an aluminum bobbin surrounding the pressure cell .",
    "the low-@xmath8 ac - susceptibility measurements for studying the superconductivity were performed in the @xmath43 range 0.12 @xmath44 10 k and @xmath0 0.76 gpa , using the same and lead with the same pressure cell .",
    "the amplitude and frequency of applied field are the same as those given above , and a bakerite coil bobbin was used to avoid the generation of induction heat .",
    "the dc - magnetization measurements for studying fm anomalies were performed down to 2 k on different batches of and rh - doped crystals , using a commercial squid magnetometer ( mpms , quantum design co. ) .",
    "1 shows temperature dependence of the ns bragg scattering intensity @xmath27 of the ( 100 ) magnetic reflection for , observed at ambient pressure by ourselves and four other groups .",
    "this is so - called the weak or small - moment antiferromagnetism of this system .",
    "the difference seen in the temperature dependence as well as the saturation value @xmath45 is striking . the single crystal prepared for the present study exhibits the smallest magnitude of @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , its onset temperature is the lowest ( @xmath1 13.5 k ) among the reports , and apparently lower than the ho transition temperature = 17.6(1 ) k , which is defined as the midpoint of the @xmath20 jump .",
    "in contrast to the reports of ns measurements , previous studies on the macroscopic properties have never indicated such strong sample dependence of the 17.5 k transition .",
    "these ns data thus strongly suggest that the weak af order with @xmath16 is not intrinsic to the ho .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the @xmath39 data taken for our new single crystal at several pressure points up to 1.07 gpa .",
    "we observed that @xmath27 remains very small in the @xmath33 range below 0.6 gpa , and exhibits a dramatic increase between 0.6 and 0.8 gpa .",
    "the @xmath46 curve at @xmath47 k is characterized by a single - step increase at @xmath33 = 0.7 gpa , which provides a remarkable contrast to our previous ns data @xcite showing a nonmonotonous increase over a wide @xmath33 range ( fig .",
    "good agreement is seen in the saturation values of @xmath27 between the present and previous results , from which one can estimate @xmath32 to be 0.41 and 0.39 /u , respectively .",
    "it can also be seen from fig .",
    "3 that the increase in the present @xmath46 is much sharper than that in @xmath48 obtained by nmr and @xmath19sr measurements @xcite , if plotted on a normalized scale . on the basis of nmr and @xmath19sr studies , the @xmath46 curves at this low @xmath8",
    "simply represent the pressure dependence of @xmath31 .",
    "the observations thus indicate that the new sample has the narrowest @xmath33 range of the phase separation .",
    "we speculate that this has been brought about by the use of a small single crystal .",
    "it is expected that a smaller crystal will have a narrower strain distribution at ambient pressure , and also allow us to perform more homogeneous pressurization .",
    "in other previous studies shown in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "3 , the original single crystals have larger dimensions ( @xmath49 4 mm in diameter ) than the present crystal ( @xmath1 2 mm ) .",
    "the sharpening of the transition achieved now allow us to determine the transition point @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) from the @xmath46 curves , with reasonable accuracy . here , we define @xmath52 as the midpoint of the increase in @xmath46 at each constant temperature .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 4 by open circles .",
    "the phase boundary line obtained starts at @xmath53 0.7 gpa , and runs upward in a very steep gradient . in the present study ,",
    "however , the above definition of @xmath52 can be adopted up to @xmath1 16 k , because @xmath46 does not reach the saturation for higher temperatures , within the present @xmath33 window .",
    "in addition , and can not be detected by the present techniques , so that we plotted in fig .",
    "4 the data points obtained by electrical resistivity measurements using a different sample and pressure conditions .",
    "therefore , we do not confirm the presence or absence of the bicritical point from the present study .",
    "nevertheless , the significant decrease in @xmath27 for @xmath54 concomitant with the sharpening of the @xmath33-induced transition strongly suggests that the ho breaks different symmetry from the af order , i.e. , the presence of the bicritical point .",
    "the superconductivity of the present sample also exhibits a dramatic change at @xmath1 0.7 gpa .",
    "we define the sc transition temperature as the peak position of @xmath55 and as the onset of decrease in @xmath56 , where @xmath56 denotes the real part of the ac susceptibility .",
    "the sc volume fraction @xmath57 was simply estimated by the magnitude of decrease in @xmath56 . as seen in fig .",
    "5 , the sc transition is very sharp for @xmath58 0.53 gpa , but becomes abruptly suppressed at @xmath1 0.7 gpa . at 0.76 gpa , the transtion can not be detected at least down to @xmath1 0.1 k. pressure dependences of , and @xmath57 are summarized in fig .",
    "the experimental results clearly demonstrate that the sudden termination of sc phase is caused by the evolution of af phase , and that they are not coexistent .",
    "interestingly , the obtained @xmath59 curve agrees fairly well with that reported by uemura et al .",
    "@xcite , if they are normalized by @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( the broken lines in fig . 6 ) . by contrast",
    ", the @xmath62 curves disagree with each other . the gradual change of their @xmath57 data reflects a wider phase - separation range in their sample .",
    "these comparisons also confirm that the superconductivity occurs only in the ho region of the crystal .",
    "considering the upper critical fields and the coherence lengths of this compound , the suppression of the superconductivity in the af phase probably can not be ascribed to the generation of the staggered internal fields .",
    "the development of the af order may rather be linked to a complete suppression of the pairing interactions .",
    "it might be suggestive that the strong magnetic excitations in the ho state vanish in the high-@xmath33 af phase , at least for @xmath63 and ( 1 , 0.4 , 0 ) @xcite .",
    "because of the strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy , the low - energy magnetic fluctuations of this system are limited to the longitudinal modes . therefore , once the moments are frozen , there will remain only high - energy magnetic fluctuations , which may not contribute to the pairing interactions .    finally , we briefly comment the fm behavior of .",
    "in addition to the anomaly at @xmath1 35 k ( @xmath64 ) pointed out by uemura et al . , we now show that the system may exhibit at least two other fm behavior below @xmath5 120(5 ) k and @xmath7 16.5(5 ) k ( fig",
    "we checked several batches of single crystals and alloys u(ru@xmath65rh@xmath66)@xmath9si@xmath9 ( @xmath67 ) , and observed that all the anomalies strongly depend on the sample quality .",
    "we also found from the ns measurements that at least the order developing below @xmath68 is not fm but af with the same @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the fm behavior below @xmath68 probably arises from the stacking faults of this af phase .",
    "it is known that the rh- doping suppresses both the ho and sc states and leads to a normal he state at @xmath69 0.04 @xcite .",
    "also in the range @xmath70 , the af order appears similarly to the effects of hydrostatic pressure . in spite of such variations of the low - temperature phases ,",
    "the three kinds of fm behavior remain nearly the same , except that their onset temperatures are slightly increasing ( not shown ) .",
    "although their origin remains open , we can thus safly say that the fm anomalies are extrinsic due to the existence of the residual impurity phases which may not be important to the intrinsic physical property of this compound .",
    "the neutron - scattering experiments using a thinner single crystal have revealed that improving the quality of sample and pressure may significantly weaken the low-@xmath33 af behavior and sharpen the @xmath33-induced transition between the ho and af phases .",
    "this implies that the af signal at the low-@xmath33 range is irrelevant to ho , and that ho breaks different symmetries from those for the high-@xmath33 af order , suggesting the possibility of scenarios in category b2 given in sec .",
    "the so - called `` small - moment antiferromagnetic phase '' will be unlikely to be present as the uniform order .",
    "the ac - susceptibility measurements performed by using the same sample under the same pressure conditions have clearly shown that an abrupt and complete suppression of the sc phase occurs simultaneously with the development of the af phase under high pressure .",
    "we thus conclude that the sc phase does not coexist with the af phase in this system , supporting the proposal in ref .",
    "we have also pointed out that the samples may contain , at least , three magnetic impurity phases of the order of 1 - 10 ppm in concentration .",
    "they exhibit very weak ferromagnetic behavior not only below @xmath1 35 k , which was previously known , but also below @xmath1 120 k and @xmath1 16.5 k. contrary to the recent suggestions @xcite , the strong sample - quality dependence of the phenomena and the rh - doping effects imply that all these phases do not essentially coupled to the ho , af and sc phases .    since the present investigations clearly demonstrated that a volume fraction of the low temperature af long range order phase below 0.7 gpa can be minimized , the intrinsic properties of ho phase , such as the superconductivity will be able to be clarified in near future .",
    "further experimental studies are planning in our group .",
