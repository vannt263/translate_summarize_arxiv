    "our construction is a generalization of the first author s work in @xcite , where he used yukio matsumoto s genus two lefschetz fibrations on @xmath3 over @xmath4 , arising from the elliptic involution of the genus two surface with two fixed points , along with the fake symplectic @xmath5 construction in @xcite obtained via knot surgery along the fibered knots . in the aforementioned paper @xcite , using the symplectic connected sum along the genus two surfaces , the first author has constructed the first known exotic minimal symplectic @xmath0 and minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifold that is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath2",
    ". a straightforward generalization of these symplectic examples to an exotic @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) , using matsumoto s genus two fibration , can be found in @xcite , where the geography problem for simply connected minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds with signature less than equal @xmath16 studied in details . considering that mustafa kormaz s and yusuf gurtas higher genus lefschetz fibrations on @xmath6 , arising from the involution of the genus @xmath17 surface , are the generalizations of matsumoto s genus two fibration , it was a natural question whether the similar construction can be carried out using these higher genus lefschetz fibrations .",
    "the fundamental group of these lefschetz fibrations are not abelian if @xmath7 and the relations in the fundamental group coming from the vanishing cycles are far more complicated , thus the fundamental group computations become more difficult and delicate than in @xcite . in this article , by carefully analysing the fundamental group ,",

    "the luttinger surgery will have some advantages for us in the computation of the fundamental groups , since the presentation of the fundamental groups look much simpler via luttinger surgery .",
