    "the problem of the thermodynamic behavior of diatomic molecules which are adsorbed on two - dimensional surfaces has attracted the interest of researchers already in the thirties @xcite . in the simplest model of this kind , only excluded volume interactions are taken into account , and the relevant quantity is the entropy of placing dimers ( which occupy two first neighboring sites ) on the lattice , which is a fundamental equation of the system . for the particular case of full occupancy and two - dimensional lattices ,",
    "this problem was solved exactly by kasteleyn and temperley and fisher @xcite .",
    "the model may be generalized in many ways .",
    "for example , an energy may be associated to the configurations of dimers on the lattice , and such models may display rather peculiar phase transitions @xcite . also , we may generalize the athermal model allowing for chains of more than two monomers ( @xmath0-mers ) and also considering only a fraction @xmath1 of the sites of the lattice occupied by monomers .",
    "the entropy of @xmath0-mers ( chains of molecular weight @xmath0 ) , as a function of the fraction of lattice sites occupied by monomers @xmath1 , is a fundamental equation of this system , and thus contains all thermodynamic information .",
    "the entropy may be defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of ways to place @xmath4 chains with @xmath5 monomers in each on the lattice with @xmath6 sites , and the thermodynamic limit is taken with fixed density of occupied sites @xmath7 . besides the exact result mentioned above for @xmath8 in two dimensions , in the literature we may find series expansions estimates @xcite , closed form approximations ( bethe and husimi lattices ) @xcite and transfer matrix calculations with finite size extrapolations @xcite on the square lattice .",
    "it is frequent in polymeric systems that the chains do not all have the same number of monomers , that is , a _",
    "polydisperse _ set of chains is found .",
    "one particular model for polydisperse chains is the equilibrium polymerization model proposed by wheeler , kennedy and pfeuty @xcite and applied to the study of equilibrium polymerization of sulfur .",
    "the system is is defined on a lattice ( celular model ) , so that each of the @xmath6 cells is occupied by a monomer ( a @xmath9 ring in the case of sulfur ) .",
    "each monomer may be _ active _ or _ inactive _ ( open and closed rings for sulfur ) , and active monomers in adjacent sites may connect , forming linear polymers which are self - and mutually avoiding walks .",
    "active monomers which are not connected to any other ones are considered one - site polymers .",
    "the statistical weight of chain composed by @xmath5 monomers ( and therefore by @xmath10 bonds ) is given by @xmath11 the additional factor 2 in the weight of multi - site chains is necessary for the exact correspondence of the equilibrium polymerization model to the @xmath12-vector of magnetism in the formal limit @xmath13 , but it may also be justified by a combinatorial argument @xcite .",
    "this model , as well as related ones , was studied in some detail in the literature @xcite , and experimental realizations of this situation are found in equilibrium polymerization of sulfur and in the so called living polymers @xcite .",
    "it is expected that for the polydisperse case the entropy is higher as compared to the monodisperse case , due to the additional degrees of freedom .",
    "another relevant point is the distribution of molecular weights @xmath0 .",
    "recently the entropy of polydisperse chains and the distribution of molecular weights of the chains were calculated in the one - dimensional case @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address these questions for the solution of the model on the bethe lattice with coordination number @xmath14 . as in the one - dimensional case , on the bethe lattice",
    "it is also possible to reach closed form expressions for the entropy and for the distribution of molecular weights .",
    "i the section [ mods ] the problem is defined in more detail and the relation of the equilibrium polymerization model to a simpler version , without the presence of one - site polymers , is shown .",
    "the entropy and the distribution of molecular weights on the bethe lattice is obtained .",
    "final discussions and comments may be found in section [ fdc ]",
    "the partition function for model for equilibrium polymerization described above may be written as : @xmath15 where the sum is over all possible configurations of the polymers on the lattice , @xmath4 is the number of polymers ( including one - site chains ) of the configuration , @xmath16 corresponds to the number of bonds and @xmath17 is a factor which assures the proper counting of configurations , as discussed above .",
    "we may now perform a partial sum over configurations in this partition function .",
    "let us consider a particular configuration of the polymers which occupy more than one site ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the number of monomers in internal site of the chains will be called @xmath19 and the number of the monomers on endpoints of the chains is @xmath20 .",
    "the number of bonds in this configuration is @xmath21 the total number of chains is @xmath22 and the number of chains with more than one monomer is equal to @xmath23 . we may now write the partition function as : @xmath24 where the first sum is restricted to configurations of multi - site chains and the second sum is over the configurations of the one - site polymers for a fixed configuration of the other chains .",
    "it is now trivial to perform the second sum , which is equal to @xmath25 , where we notice that @xmath26 is the number of sites not occupied by monomers in multi - site chains and each of these sites may be either empty ( weight 1 ) or occupied by a one - site polymer ( weight @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , the partition function of the equilibrium polymerization model may be written as : @xmath28 where the sum over configurations is now restricted to chains with more than one monomers , the variable @xmath29 is equal to @xmath30 and the activities of endpoint and internal monomers are @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "we may now restrict our discussion to the model without one - site monomers , described by the grand - canonical partition function @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] a possible configuration of the chains is shown .    .",
    "]    if the lattice has @xmath6 sites , the density of endpoint monomers is @xmath34 , the density of internal monomers is @xmath35 , and the total density of monomers is @xmath36 . the densities may be obtained from the partition function : @xmath37 and @xmath38    let us now consider the model defined on a cayley tree with coordination number @xmath14 . due to the hierarchical structure of this lattice , we may define partial partition functions on rooted subtrees , and it is not difficult to write down recursion relations for subtrees with an additional generation @xcite . for the present model , we may define two partial partition functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , without and with a polymer bond on the root bond of the subtree , respectively . considering the operation of attaching @xmath41 @xmath12-generations subtrees to a new site and bond , we obtain recursion relations for the partial partition functions of a subtree with @xmath42 generations .",
    "the contributions to this recursion relations are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , and the resulting expressions are @xmath43     and the second line shows the contributions to @xmath44 . ]    if we now define the ratio of partial partition functions @xmath45 , we will find the following recursion relation : @xmath46 in the thermodynamic limit , the fixed point of this recursion relation is reached .",
    "the partition function of the model on the cayley tree may be obtained if we consider the operation of attaching @xmath14 subtrees to the central site of the tree .",
    "the result is : @xmath47 the bethe lattice corresponds to the central region of the cayley tree , and therefore we concentrate our attention on the densities of endpoint monomers and of internal monomers on this site .",
    "the results are : @xmath48 and @xmath49 for given values of the activities @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the fixed point value of the ratio @xmath52 may be found using eq .",
    "( [ rrr ] ) and thus the corresponding densities of endpoint and internal monomers at the central site of the tree are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ rhoe ] ) and ( [ rhoi ] ) , respectively . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the densities are smooth functions of the activities , but in the polymer limit ( infinite chain ) @xmath54 a continuous phase transition is found between a non - polymerized phase @xmath55 and a polymerized phase @xmath56 , at @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "if we call @xmath58 the entropy per site of the model , we notice that the ratios of the chemical potentials and @xmath59 are given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 we then may obtain the entropy integrating the chemical potentials . to do this ,",
    "we start inverting equations for the densities ( [ rhoe ] ) and ( [ rhoi ] ) , which leads to : @xmath62 and @xmath63 if these activities are now substituted into the fixed point equation @xmath64 , we obtain , from eq .",
    "( [ rrr ] ) the fixed point value of the ratio : @xmath65 substituting this result in eqs .",
    "( [ zer ] ) and ( [ zir ] ) , we obtain the activities as functions of the densities in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath66 and @xmath67 the entropy may now be calculated integrating the eqs .",
    "( [ se ] ) and ( [ si ] ) in the @xmath68 plane .",
    "we choose the trajectory @xmath69 , so that : @xmath70 d\\rho -\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\int_0^{\\rho_e } \\ln \\left[\\frac{\\rho\\sqrt{q-2\\rho_i-\\rho } }    { q(1-\\rho_i-\\rho)\\sqrt{2\\rho_i+\\rho } } \\right ] d\\rho.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the result of this integration is : @xmath71    the entropy may be compared to results in the literature in some particular cases . for @xmath72 the case of infinite polymers is obtained , and the expression reduces to eq . ( 26 ) in reference @xcite .",
    "the entropy of dimers on the bethe lattice ( eq . ( 27 ) in reference @xcite , where in the correct result @xmath73 should be replaced by @xmath74 ) is obtained for @xmath55 . finally , the one - dimensional result ( eq .",
    "( 9 ) in reference @xcite ) is recovered for @xmath75 . to compare the result with the monodisperse case , it is convenient to rewrite the entropy eq .",
    "( [ srhoie ] ) as a function of the mean molecular weight @xmath76 and the total density of monomers @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting expression is : @xmath78 we may now find the contribution to the entropy of polydispersivity , calculating @xmath79 for @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the entropy of the monodisperse case ( eq .",
    "( 22 ) of reference @xcite ) .",
    "we find a result which is independent of @xmath14 : @xmath82,\\ ] ] and therefore this result is identical to the one obtained in the one - dimensional case studied in reference @xcite .",
    "finally , we may find the distribution of the molecular weights in the polydisperse case . to obtain this result ,",
    "we must keep track of the number of monomers incorporated into each chain , and we may define multiple subtree partial partition functions @xmath83 ,",
    "@xmath84 , in such a way that @xmath39 corresponds to a subtree with no polymer bond at the root , as before , and @xmath83 stands for a subtree with a polymer bond on the root connected to @xmath0 monomers above .",
    "the recursion relations for these partial partition functions will be : @xmath85 we proceed defining the ratios of partial partition functions @xmath86 , for @xmath87 . the recursion relations for the ratios will be : @xmath88 where @xmath89 inspection of these set of recursion relations leads to the following ansatz for the fixed point values of the ratios @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "the ratios @xmath92 are related to the ratio @xmath52 defined above through @xmath93 . using the fixed point value for @xmath52 found in eq .",
    "( [ fpr ] ) , we may then find the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the results are : @xmath96 and @xmath97 now we consider the operation of attaching @xmath14 subtrees to the central site of the tree . the probability that an endpoint of a chain with @xmath0 monomers is located on the central site will be equal to @xmath98 , and the probability to have an endpoint of a chain located on the central site is equal to @xmath99 . therefore , the probability to find a chain with exactly @xmath0 monomers among all chains on the lattice with mean molecular weight @xmath100 will be given by : @xmath101 this exponential distribution of molecular weights is again independent of the coordination number @xmath14 and therefore is identical to the one obtained in @xcite for the one - dimensional case @xmath75 .",
    "although the equilibrium polymerization model was extensively studied in the literature , the main focus of these studies was its critical behavior , which occurs in the limit @xmath102 ( @xmath54 ) , where the mean molecular weight of the chains diverges . here ,",
    "similarly to what was done by dudowicz et al @xcite for a similar model , which essential differs from the present one only by the fact that it is canonical with respect to the iniciator molecules , we turn our attention to the region of parameters where the model is non critical .",
    "the calculations performed by dudowicz et al were in the flory - huggins approximation , which for simple polymer models is equivalent to the bethe lattice solution .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that boths calculations lead to an exponential distribution of molecular weights of the chains .",
    "the model studied by dudowicz et al is canononical with respect to the initiator molecules , while the present model is grand - canonical with respect to the endpoint monomers . in the polymer limit , the distribution of molecular weights should in general be described by the scaling behavior @xcite @xmath103 in the limit of small overlap , reducing to an exponential decay at large overlaps .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath104 is in general larger than 1 , but its classical value is 1 . since the flory - huggins approximation and bethe lattice calculations should lead to classical exponents , the exponential decay of the distribution of molecular weights",
    "is expected in the polymer limit @xmath105 , but nonexponential decay would be allowed for finite @xmath100 .",
    "we are presently innvestigating if this actually occurs when the model is studied using better ( mean field ) approximations .",
    "although the details of the calculations above were presented for the restricted equilibrium polymerization model , without the presence of one - site chains , it is easy to obtain the correpondin results for the original model , using eqs .",
    "( [ yxi ] ) , ( [ ze ] ) and ( [ zi ] ) .",
    "for example , the density of sites occupied by the one - site polymers is @xmath106 making @xmath17 .",
    "the result is @xmath107 a similar calculation may be done for the density of polymers ( including the one - site chains ) @xmath108 , leading to : @xmath109 while the density of bonds is given by : @xmath110",
