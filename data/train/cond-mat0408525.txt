    "for the past several years , the relationship between charge stripe correlations@xcite and high-@xmath8 superconductivity has been intensively studied to clarify whether the role of the stripes for the superconductivity is positive or negative .",
    "systematic studies on the la@xmath9nd@xmath10sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lnsco ) system have shown that for the low - temperature tetragonal ( ltt ; @xmath11 ) phase , incommensurate ( ic ) charge- and magnetic orders are stabilized and compete with superconductivity@xcite .",
    "this result provided a qualitative explanation for the long - standing mystery of the `` 1/8-problem '' in la-214 cuprates@xcite , namely , the _ ordered state _ of charge stripes induced by the ltt transformation has a negative impact with high-@xmath8 superconductivity .    in the 1/8-hole - doped la@xmath0ba@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lbsco ) system , the crystal structure at the lowest temperature changes from ltt to a low - temperature - orthorhombic ( lto ; @xmath12 ) phase via the low - temperature - less - orthorhombic ( ltlo ; @xmath13 ) phase , as sr - concentration @xmath14 increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "fujita  _ et al_. have composed a detailed phase diagram of the crystal structure , ic charge / magnetic order , and @xmath8 for this system@xcite ,    = 2.25 in    where the charge order is stabilized only in ltt and ltlo phases ( gray - hatched region in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and competes with superconductivity . on the contrary , the magnetic order in this system , which is robust in all the structural phases , shows a weak competition with the superconductivity .",
    "the momentum structure and the temperature evolution of the charge order in the lbsco system have been studied by neutron diffraction@xcite as well as x - ray diffraction@xcite . in the ltt phase for @xmath5 , the ic modulation wave vector ( @xmath15 ) of the charge order is @xmath16 with high - temperature - tetragonal ( htt ; @xmath17 ) notation .",
    "however in the ltlo phase for @xmath7 , @xmath18 shifts away from the tetragonal - symmetric position to an orthorhombic - symmetric position , giving the wave vector of @xmath19 .",
    "the charge order in this system is stabilized just below the temperature where the structural phase transition from lto into ltt or ltlo phase occurs @xmath20 .",
    "further , the ordered state evolves as the order parameter of the ltt or ltlo structure increases .",
    "these facts clearly show that a strong correlation exists between the charge order and the crystal structure , giving rise to suppression of superconductivity .",
    "the charge order is detectable as lattice distortions in neutron and x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "recently , our preliminary x - ray diffraction measurements showed that the ic superlattice peaks at @xmath21 are @xmath2210 times stronger in intensity than that at @xmath23 .",
    "this is due to the amplitude of the scattering wave vector @xmath24 and the strong @xmath25-dependence of the structure factor for the superlattice peak@xcite , suggesting the importance of lattice distortions along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "this result indicates that the superlattice peak at higher-@xmath27 positions is much more sensitive to the charge order ( or the lattice distortion ) than that at lower-@xmath27 positions observed previously@xcite .",
    "this motivated us to conduct detailed measurements of ic superlattice peaks at higher-@xmath27 position , especially at @xmath21 or @xmath28 , for la@xmath0ba@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 using a synchrotron x - ray source for diffraction studies , which can elucidate detailed differences between the nature of charge stripes in the ltt and ltlo phases . in this paper , we show that for @xmath7 and @xmath29 , short - range charge correlation starts appearing even above @xmath6 while the correlations appear just at @xmath6 for @xmath5 .",
    "the results imply that the evolution of the charge stripes in the ltlo phase is different from that in the ltt phase , which relates to the order of the structural phase transition from the lto to the ltt or ltlo phase .",
    "we also show the possibility that the displacement pattern of the atoms induced by the charge stripe order in the ltt phase is different from that in the ltlo phase .",
    "single crystals of lbsco with @xmath5 , 0.075 , 0.09 , and 0.10 were cut into a cylindrical shape with dimensions of 0.43  mm diameter and 5  mm height , where the longest axis was parallel to the @xmath26-axis .",

    "the x - ray energy was tuned to 20  kev and 32.6  kev using a si(111 ) double monochromator at bl46xu and bl02b1 , respectively .",

    "the line - width along the @xmath33-direction is broader than the instrumental resolution while the line - width along @xmath32-direction reaches the resolution limit .",
    "thus the correlation length for the ltt structure , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are estimated to be @xmath55    and 196@xmath525   , respectively , indicating a large anisotropy of the structural coherence or a mosaic spread due to a local disorder at the ltt phase . at @xmath56",

    "structural phase transitions from the lto to ltlo , and from the lto to ltt phase , in la-214 cuprates can be understood in terms of the landau - ginzburg free energy of the order parameter , which is described by the amplitude of the tilting of cuo@xmath93 octahedra@xcite . in this framework",
    ", the lto - ltt transition shows a first - order phase transition while the lto - ltlo transition should be a second - order phase transition , which depends on the sign of the eighth - order term in expanding the landau free energy .",
    "therefore , the structural phase transition in @xmath5 is a first - order while @xmath7 and @xmath29 should show a second - order phase transition .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction analyses have shown that the lto - ltt transition in la@xmath0ba@xmath94cuo@xmath3 is a first order transition , where both the lto and ltt phases coexist and the volume fraction of the ltt phase increases with decreasing temperature@xcite . therefore , the temperature dependence of ( 5 , 0 , 0 ) intensity and @xmath54 for @xmath5 , shown in fig .",

    "based on the stripe model , @xmath61 denotes the deformation of the periodicity or the discommensuration for charge stripes and @xmath51 corresponds to the mosaicity of stripes . from this point of view , the results for @xmath7 and @xmath29 indicate that the deformation of the stripe - periodicity and the stripe - mosaicity are reduced as temperature decreases and 2@xmath102 is pinned finally at the value of hole concentration .",
    "if the 1/4-filling is robust in the charge stripes , the temperature variation of 2@xmath102 indicates that the number of localized holes increases with decreasing temperature , which immobilizes charge stripes .",
    "the locking of the incommensurability is also seen in lnsco@xcite and striped nickelates@xcite . however , the connection between the locking effect and the structural phase transition was not observed in either case . note that the temperature dependence of the incommensurability for magnetic order should be compared with that of 2@xmath102 in the @xmath7 and @xmath29 samples to clarify the microscopic interrelation between the spin- and charge correlations .",

    "<S> the nature of charge stripe order and its relationship with structural phase transitions were studied using synchrotron x - ray diffraction in la@xmath0ba@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . for @xmath5 , as temperature increased , incommensurate superlattice peaks associated with the charge order disappeared just at the structural phase transition temperature , @xmath6 . however , for @xmath7 and 0.09 , the superlattice peaks still existed as a short range correlation even above @xmath6 , indicating a precursor of charge ordering . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , temperature dependences of the superlattice peak intensity , correlation length , and incommensurability for @xmath5 are different from those for @xmath7 and 0.09 . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the transition process into the charge stripe order strongly correlates with the order of the structural phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative comparison of the structure factor associated with the charge order have been also made for all the samples .    </S>"
