    "[ fig : syretrender ] , are : + * 1 : * below @xmath2=0 $ ] the thin and thick disks show distinct and smooth abundance trends .",
    "this indicate that the thin and thick disks formed at epochs that are separated in time and in space , and from interstellar gas that were reasonably homogeneous . +",
    "* 2 : * the presence of sne type ia signatures in the thick disk .",
    "this shows up as a  knee \" in the abundance trend at @xmath2 \\sim -0.4 $ ] , and is interpreted as being due to the time delay between the sne type ii and the long - lived sne type ia in the elemental enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "star formation must therefore have continued in the thick disk after sne type ia rate peaked , since we see thick disk stars with @xmath2>-0.4 $ ] that have been born out of interstellar gas with a lower @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this means that the sfr in the thick disk must have initially been fast to allow the build - up of oxygen from sne type ii at high metallicities before the enrichment from sne type ia , producing none or little oxygen , set in . + * 3 : * quiet evolution in the thin disk . the abundance trend shows a decline when going from overabundances of @xmath3 \\simeq 0.2 $ ] at @xmath2 \\simeq -0.7 $ ] and reaching @xmath3 \\simeq -0.2 $ ] at @xmath2=0.4 $ ] . that the  knee \" is not present in the thin disk implies that the star formation rate in the thin disk was quite low , with sne type ii and type ia going off in an alternative manner . + * 4 : * at @xmath2>0 $ ] the linear trend found at sub - solar metallicities continous for the thin disk stars .",
    "in contrast nissen and edvardsson  ( 1992 ) found the @xmath3 $ ] to level out at these metallicities .",
    "however , they did not take the nii blend in the [ oi ] line into account , which becomes severe at these metallicities , see fig .",

    "the nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) @xmath3 $ ] trend also levels out at @xmath2>0 $ ] even though they considered the ni blend .",
    "they did however assume a solar ratio for [ ni / fe ] which according to our ni results ( bensby et al .",
    "2003a submitted ) will lead to an underestimation of the ni contribution .",
    "our ni trend show a prominent increase in [ ni / fe ] at @xmath2>0 $ ] .",
    "the results we find for oxygen are fully consistent with the results we obtained for other @xmath13-elements , mg , si , ca , and ti , for the same stars from feros spectra , bensby et al .",

    "we have derived , using equivalent width measurements , abundances for the other @xmath13-elements , mg , si , ca , and ti ( bensby et al . 2003a submitted ) . at @xmath14<0 $ ]",
    "the thick disk trends for these elements are mainly flat when compared to oxygen .",
    "this indicate the common origin of the @xmath13-elements , namely from massive stars that become sne type ii . for the thin disk the trends look different , showing an increasing @xmath15 $ ] ratio with increasing @xmath14 $ ] and a flat trend at @xmath14>0 $ ]",
    ". this could be due to that sne type ia play a role in the synthesizing of these elements .",
