    "electron spin dynamics in mesoscopic devices has been attracting a lot of attention recently in the context of spintronics @xcite and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a crucial feature of this dynamics is the relaxation of the electron s spin due to the interaction with an environment . generally speaking , the coherence of an electronic spin state vanishes during the time @xmath0 , which limits the possibility of coherent manipulation of qubits , while relaxation to thermal equilibrium occurs during another time @xmath1 , which is usually larger than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "several types of spin - dependent interactions can give rise to electron spin relaxation , e.g. the electron spin - orbit interaction @xcite and the electron - nuclei hyperfine interaction @xcite .",
    "their action depends essentially on the dimension of the system .",
    "systems of zero dimension , i.e. quantum dots ( qds ) , are characterized by a discrete electron energy spectrum . in this case energy conservation in the spin - flip process usually can be fulfilled only by transferring the energy to another subsystem , e.g. phonons .",
    "the energy transfer includes both the zeeman energy of the electron spin in an external field and possibly the energy of an orbital transition .",
    "a discussion of other electron spin relaxation mechanisms not mentioned above and relevant to qds can be found in ref .",
    ", for example .",
    "electron spin relaxation in a qd due to hyperfine interaction alone , in the absence of an external magnetic field , was investigated recently in refs . .",
    "many years ago , the phonon - assisted electron spin - flip transition between zeeman sublevels due to hyperfine interaction with an impurity nucleus and lattice nuclei was considered for impurity - bound electrons in silicon @xcite , where the authors investigated the nuclear polarization in the overhauser effect .",
    "the process that has been considered in that paper is associated with a crystal dilation and a corresponding adiabatic change in the electron effective mass and , as a consequence , in the electron envelope wave function and the hyperfine coupling constant .",
    "recently , electron spin relaxation due to the hyperfine contact interaction has been readdressed with an application to gaas qds @xcite .",
    "the transition amplitude was calculated in second - order perturbation theory , describing the action of the hyperfine contact interaction and a spin - independent piezoelectric electron - phonon coupling .",
    "in this paper we will analyze another spin relaxation mechanism provided by the combination of hyperfine contact interaction and the influence of phonons on the electron inside a qd . in our approach",
    "we take into account directly the phonon - induced motion of nuclei which are coupled to the electron spin through the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction appears via the displacement field shifting the positions of the nuclei , and therefore is independent of the piezoelectric coupling that applies only to crystals without inversion symmetry ( such as gaas , but not si ) .",
    "moreover , this mechanism allows the electron - nucleus spin flip - flop with a simultaneous emission of a phonon to appear already in first - order perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , it will turn out that it is necessary to keep as well the second - order terms associated with the motion of the electron confining potential , since they lead to a crucial cancellation of first - order terms at low frequencies of the emitted phonon , thereby suppressing the relaxation rate .",
    "the physical reason behind this is the following : long - wavelength phonons displace both the lattice nuclei and the electron s confining potential in the same way .",
    "however , it is only the relative motion of the electron with respect to the nuclei that enables a transition .",
    "therefore , the influence of long - wavelength phonons is suppressed .",
    "if , on the other hand , the confining potential can be considered as fixed or it moves independently from the lattice nuclei , this suppression does not apply any more , and the destructive interference between first - order and second - order terms is broken .",
    "the present article is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we introduce the hamiltonian of our model , including the effect of lattice vibrations on the hyperfine coupling and the confining potential .",
    "after that , we derive the electron spin flip transition amplitudes due to this perturbation , discussing the partial cancellation of terms and the dominating contribution .",
    "we calculate the transition rate , eq .",
    "( [ zeeman - t1 ] ) , for the case of zeeman - split sublevels of the electron ground state ( sec . [ zeemansec ] ) , and perform an analogous derivation for the case of a triplet - singlet transition ( sec .",
    "[ tripletsec ] ) . finally , in section [ numestsec ] we look at numerical estimates for realistic system parameters .",
    "in our model , we will assume the displacement of the qd confining potential to be described by the phonon displacement field evaluated at the center of the dot ( which we take to be the origin ) .",
    "note that this is analogous to the case of an impurity - bound electron . any more detailed description ( e.g. allowing for a distortion of the potential )",
    "would require further specifications concerning the way this potential is applied to the dot , but would not add significantly to the realism of the present model .    in the effective mass approximation",
    "the hamiltonian of the system of electrons and phonons in the qd has the following form , if the perturbations due to electron - phonon and hyperfine interactions are excluded : @xmath2      { \\nonumber}\\\\      & + & \\!\\ ! \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i\\neq",

    "the corresponding transition matrix element is provided by first order perturbation theory in the potential @xmath52 : @xmath53    it is important that an alternative process is possible for the transition between the same two states , where the remaining two terms in @xmath54 ( namely @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) contribute in second order perturbation theory , yielding an amplitude that is of the same order of magnitude as eq .",

    "note that the complete electronic energy includes the zeeman energy as well , and the difference between initial and final electron energies is accounted for by the energy of the emitted phonon , @xmath59 .",

    "however , this experiment dealt with a nonequilibrium transport situation , with a resulting spin - flip mechanism whose rate turns out to be orders of magnitude larger than the one discussed in the present article ( see ref . ) .",
    "in summary , we have considered a specific mechanism for inelastic electron spin relaxation in a qd induced by the electron - nuclei hyperfine interaction in combination with lattice vibrations .",
    "we have found that the interference between first and second orders of perturbation theory is essential for a correct description of the suppression of relaxation at small transition frequencies . the relaxation rate has been calculated both for the transition between zeeman sublevels of the orbital ground state and for the triplet - singlet transition .",
    "we have obtained estimates based on these general results and realistic system parameters .",
    "the estimates demonstrate that the relaxation rate due to this particular mechanism is very small : for the spin relaxation between zeeman sublevels it is much less than the rate calculated earlier in second order perturbation theory with an emission of a phonon through piezoelectric electron - phonon coupling in a gaas qd @xcite , and it is less than ( or at most comparable with ) the relaxation rate due to the change in the localized electron effective mass induced by the lattice dilation in silicon @xcite . for the triplet - singlet transition , the rate in gaas qds is still smaller by an order of magnitude than the corresponding rate of the piezoelectric mechanism ."
