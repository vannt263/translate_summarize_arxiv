    "the substantial evolution of laser sources during the last decades has permitted to monitor , and even control processes taking place in a broad range of time scales .",
    "more recently , the efforts in the development of coherent sources of ultrashort pulse duration , i.e. , attosecond ( as ) and femtosecond ( fs ) , together with the increase control over the laser pulses , have provided an ideal tool for recording snapshots of ultrafast evolving systems ( see for example @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "nowadays , experiments with femtosecond resolution in the fields of chemistry , physics and biology are carried out routinely by using a great variety of pump probe methods , e.g. , transient ionization , fluorescence up conversion , fluorescence dip spectroscopy , and femtosecond time resolved raman @xcite . in these techniques ,",
    "the system is excited by one ( or more ) photons of the pump pulse triggering simultaneously in all the particles the process of interest . after a variable temporal delay ,",
    "the absorption of another ( or more ) photons from the probe laser produces a measurable signal .",
    "the dependence of the system response on the pump probe delay contains the desired information on the dynamics of the process .    modeling the collected time dependent signals is pivotal for the correct extraction of the information contained in the experimental data .",
    "there are two possible approaches for this task : an incoherent treatment based on rate equations , and a coherent model where the interaction of the system with the pump pulse is described by the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation ( or the equivalent bloch equations ) .",
    "let us consider that the system can be described by a two - state model .",
    "three different regimes can be distinguished .",
    "if the losses dominates the dynamics of the system , the coherence induced by the laser is lost very rapidly , i.e. , we can apply adiabatic elimination @xcite , and therefore the incoherent treatment provides an accurate description of the dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "if the losses are much slower than the pump pulse duration , the incoherent treatment can be applied once again if one is not interested in reproducing the excitation process .",
    "finally , in a situation where the dynamics of interest is of the order of the excitation pulse , the temporal information is given by the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "however , this simple two - state model is in principle not applicable when the pump laser bandwidth is large enough to couple more than one single state , as it is usually found in molecules , clusters , and solids . in this scenario ,",
    "a full theoretical treatment requires of very expensive quantum dynamical calculations , and it is usually not accessible , being the ordinary approach to reduce this coherently excited multistate system to an incoherently excited two - state system . the accuracy of this approximation has been tested elsewhere @xcite , proving to be very effective as long as the determination of the zero delay between pump and probe laser pulses is made correctly .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to explore the applicability of the coherent and incoherent approximation to the modeling of femtosecond transients derived from molecular dynamics .",
    "although the coherent excitation of quasicontinuum systems has been a matter of intense research , and the effect of dephasing and density of states well documented experimentally , and rigorously described theoretically ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , herein we adopt a different simpler approach from the perspective of the adiabatic evolution of the levels outside the laser bandwidth .",
    "this phenomenon is generally known as coherent population return ( cpr ) @xcite . in this model",
    "a coherently excited multistate system is treated as the sum of independent coherently excited two - state systems with variable detuning from the central wavelength of the excitation laser .",
    "this procedure will allow us to justify qualitatively , and analytically with the help of fourier analysis , the use of the incoherent approximation for such complex systems .",
    "we will provide analytical expressions to quantify the error carried out by this treatment , demonstrating that the critical parameter that determines the validity of this approach is the distribution of states with respect to the laser bandwidth , rather than the density of states as it is commonly accepted .",
    "furthermore , this treatment underlines the importance of considering cpr for a correct description of laser - matter interaction @xcite",
    "for coherent interactions the description of the population dynamics is provided by the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the statevector of the system , and @xmath2 the hamiltonian including the interaction with a radiation field .",
    "let us consider a two - state system interacting with the electric field of a laser pulse with carrier frequency @xmath3 , detuned from the transition frequency by @xmath4 .",
    "this situation is described by fig[twolevelsytem ] .",

    "the energies of the excited and ground states are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively.,width=151,height=132 ]    the time dependent hamiltonian in the electric dipole approximation can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the two - state field free hamiltonian with energies @xmath6 and @xmath5 @xmath9,\\ ] ] and @xmath10 is the interacting hamiltonian @xmath11,\\ ] ] with @xmath12,\\ ] ] being @xmath13 the dipole moment , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 the polarization direction and the slow varying envelope of the electric field respectively .",

    "these adiabatic eigenstates can be written as @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mixing angle @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are the bare states .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies are @xmath28.\\ ] ]    let us assume @xmath17 to be negligibly small outside a finite time interval @xmath29 , i.e. , outside the pulse duration @xmath30 .",
    "consider now the case of the laser frequency detuned from exact resonance , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "if at the beginning of the interaction all the population is in the ground state , the statevector of the system @xmath1 at time @xmath32 is aligned parallel to the adiabatic state @xmath33 because @xmath34 .",
    "if the evolution of the system is adiabatic , that means the hamiltonian varies sufficiently slow in time , the statevector of the system @xmath1 remains always aligned with the adiabatic state @xmath33 .",
    "thus , during the excitation process when @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the statevector @xmath1 is a coherent superposition of the bare states ( see eq.[phiminus ] ) . therefore , some population is transiently excited to the upper state .",
    "however at the end of the interaction when @xmath37 , the statevector of the system becomes once again aligned with the initial state @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "the population transferred during the process from the ground state to the excited state returns completely to the ground state after the excitation process .",
    "no population resides permanently in the excited state , no matter how large the transient intensity of the laser pulse may be ( see fig.[popubare ] ) .",
    "this coherent phenomenon is called coherent population return ( cpr ) @xcite .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the condition for smooth adiabatic evolution  and hence cpr is just the adiabatic condition @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to notice that the adiabatic condition is independent of @xmath17 , and therefore of the laser intensity .",
    "population dynamics in the case of coherent population return ( see eq.[popu ] for the analytical expressions of the populations ) .",
    "p@xmath41 is the population of state i ( i=1 , 2).,width=264,height=226 ]    it is necessary to consider now a probe process to detect the population transferred to state @xmath42 , e.g. , by ionization of the excited state with a short probe laser pulse .",
    "according to our previous discussion , if the systems evolves adiabatically ( @xmath40 ) no population remains in the excited state once the pump pulse is over due to cpr , and the ionization signal is produced exclusively when pump and probe pulses overlap in time .",
    "on the other hand , if the evolution of the system is diabatic , meaning @xmath43 , there is a permanent population transferred to the excited state , and consequently , ionization signal when pump and probe pulse do not temporally overlap",
    ".       multistate system as the sum of independent two - state systems with different detunings.,width=302,height=196 ]    so far , we have assumed a two - state system .",
    "however , this simple model can not be usually applied to real systems where inside the laser bandwidth a substantial number of states are excited , being necessary to consider a more general situation . if as a first approximation we neglect any interaction between the excited states , and assume that the losses of the system are much slower than the excitation process , we can model a multistate system by means of the sum of multiple individual two - state systems with different detunings with respect to the excitation laser ( see fig.[twolevelsytem_multiple ] ) .",
    "it is worth to notice that the mechanisms that couple different excited levels as internal vibrational redistribution ( ivr ) in the case of vibronic levels , take place usually on hundreds of femtoseconds .",
    "thus , for fs laser pulses this approximation is valid .",
    "+     ionization signal versus detuning and delay between pump and probe laser ( 1 + 3 ) .",
    "the parameters chosen for the simulation were : pump pulse duration ( full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the peak intensity ) @xmath44 fs , probe pulse duration @xmath45 fs , peak rabi frequency @xmath46 , peak ionization loss rate @xmath47 , number of states per @xmath48 @xmath49.,width=302,height=211 ]    figure[detunings ] shows the ionization signal versus detuning of the pump pulse , and temporal delay between pump and probe pulses , for the system proposed in fig.[twolevelsytem ] .",
    "as we have previously discussed , we can see that only for those detunings that do not fulfilled the adiabatic condition ( @xmath50 ) , there is a permanent transfer of population to the excited state , and therefore , a transient ionization signal when pump and probe laser pulses do not temporally overlap . according to the model described in fig.[twolevelsytem_multiple ]",
    ", the total ionization signal will be the sum of the ionization signals obtained for different @xmath4 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[comparison ] together with the solution to the time dependent schrdinger equation on resonance ( coherent limit ) , and the solution of the kinetic model ( incoherent limit ) for a two - state system .",
    "we can see that the coherent excitation of a multistate system , under certain conditions that will be discussed in the next section , is equivalent to the incoherent excitation of a two - state system .",
    "this well known result @xcite simplifies enormously the analysis of pump probe experiments involving a large number of states .",
    "additionally , for the reliable interpretation of the experimental data , it is necessary an exact determination of the zero delay between pump and probe laser pulses . a widely used method to determine the zero delay is to assign it to the position where the excitation signal of a long living state reaches half of its maximum value .",
    "figure[comparison ] shows that this criterion is only valid in the case of the incoherent limit , while for the coherent treatment the 1/2 value is shifted @xmath51 respect to the zero delay position .",
    "therefore , in establishing the zero delay time is necessary to know beforehand what kind of behavior the problem system presents .",
    "normalized ionization signal as a function of the delay between pump and probe pulses , for the different possible approaches to the problem : solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation for a two - state system on resonance ( black solid line ) , solution of rate equations ( red solid line ) , and multiple two - state approximation ( green circles ) .",
    "@xmath52 is the pulse duration full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the peak intensity.,width=302,height=211 ]         ionization signal versus delay between pump and probe pulses for different detunings .",
    "all the signals are normalized with respect to the maximum signal obtained at @xmath53.,width=302,height=211 ]    according to our previous discussion , the ionization signal of a quasi continuum system has two different contributions : a step - like transient signal for those detunings that do not fulfilled the adiabatic condition , and a symmetric signal with respect to the delay between pump and probe laser pulses , for those detunings that fulfilled the adiabatic condition ( see fig.[diff_detunings ] ) .",
    "when both contributions are added up , the latter is the responsible for the change in the slope that shifts the transient signal to earlier times ( see fig.[comparison ] ) .",
    "since the contributions to the signal coming from the non adiabatic region ( @xmath54 ) , is much more intense than the one coming from the adiabatic region ( @xmath55 ) , it is necessary to have a large number of states inside the adiabatic region , i.e. , outside the pump laser bandwidth , to reach the convergence to the incoherent limit .",
    "if this is not the case , the final situation will be an intermediate case between the coherent and the incoherent limits , being necessary a more elaborated analysis of the experimental results .",
    "the convergence of the incoherent and the coherent treatments can also be demonstrated analytically .",
    "let us define the intensity like    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the peak intensity , and @xmath52 the pulse duration ( fwhm ) , the rabi frequency like    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the peak rabi frequency , and let us suppose a two - state system ( see fig.[twolevelsytem ] ) .",
    "in the case of incoherent excitation , it can be easily shown that the evolution of the population in the target state is described by    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the absorption coefficient @xcite .",
    "+ considering a situation where the population of the ground state is barely perturbed , which is a reasonable approximation for fs pulses excitation , the population in the excited state reads : @xmath62    for coherent excitation the description of the population evolution is based on the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation with an appropriate hamiltonian .",
