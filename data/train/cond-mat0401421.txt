    "transport properties of deeply cooled liquids may change by several orders of magnitude when one reduces the temperature @xcite .",
    "indeed , a liquid undergoing a deep quench below its melting transition may stay in a metastable supercooled state . in this state ,",
    "the relaxation time is much larger than the experimental time scale , and the system is always out of equilibrium .",
    "experiments suggest that in `` fragile '' glass formers , there is a temperature @xmath3 at which the relaxation time diverges .",
    "even if the mere existence of a divergence of the relaxation time @xmath4 at finite temperature is still controversial , the experimental data can be often fitted by the so - called vogel - fulcher - tammann law @xmath5 .",
    "since such a glassy behavior has been observed in a wide range of materials , there have been huge efforts dedicated to computing the transport properties in supercooled liquids . among them , the mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite appears to give results and predictions which fit remarkably well with data for many different systems @xcite .",
    "however , despite its successes , the derivation of mct either from the mori - zwanzig formalism @xcite or from fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite remains quite obscure , and systematic improvements seem difficult to implement and control .",
    "hence , with the aim of understanding better the structure of the dynamics , alternative methods of computing transport properties of systems of many interacting particles such as supercooled liquids are worth examining . in this paper , we will develop a method to compute the long time self - diffusion constant which allows systematic double perturbative expansions , in the strength of the interaction and in the density of particles .",
    "the approach is based on the langevin dynamics for @xmath6 particles with two - body interactions , though this approach may be generalised easily to three - body interactions .",
    "such markovian langevin dynamics can be invoked in liquids over length and time scales where inertial effects become negligible .",
    "the langevin equation thus represents a course grained image of the system and the effective parameters and interactions used in the langevin approach require microscopic derivation .",
    "the langevin approach also naturally describes the dynamics of colloids in solution @xcite , the brownian noise is induced by the solvent and the effective interaction between particles is composed of a pairwise direct interaction between the colloids plus additional hydrodynamic interactions induced via the solvent .",
    "we consider the interacting set of langevin equations for particles @xmath7 interacting via a pairwise potential @xmath8 depending only on the distance between the particles at temperature @xmath9 in @xmath10 dimensions :    @xmath11    the units of time are chosen such that the white noise field @xmath12 has correlation function @xmath13 where the angled brackets indicate averaging over the thermal noise .",
    "the term @xmath14 is thus the bare diffusion constant of the particles in the absence of interactions .",
    "the fluctuation dissipation theorem or einstein relation implies that @xmath15 .",
    "this system of equations can be used to describe a colloidal system of interacting particles suspended in solution when hydrodynamic interactions are neglected .",
    "the neglecting of hydrodynamic interactions is justified where the direct two body interaction @xmath16 is of much longer range than the hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "a commonly cited example is charged colloids in a solution when the debye length is very large with respect to the particle sizes .",
    "the effective macroscopic diffusion constant @xmath17 of particle @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19    it is the aim of this paper to develop a new technique for the calculation of @xmath17 .",
    "there are two basic routes to calculate @xmath17 .",
    "the first is based on the direct calculation of the diffusion constant @xcite .",
    "the second is based on the calculation of the modification of the response to a small external force on a given particle due the interaction with the other particles - the so called relaxation effect ; the resulting value of @xmath17 is then determined from the einstein or fluctuation dissipation relation @xcite .",
    "one approach to studying the dynamics of a tracer particle is to write an effective one particle langevin equation with a non - markovian memory kernel , derived via projection operator techniques @xcite .",
    "this kernel must then be computed by invoking approximation or closure schemes such as mode coupling - like approximations @xcite , cluster expansions @xcite , or weak coupling expansions @xcite .",
    "other approaches are based on closure schemes for the smoluchowski equation @xcite , which normally involve closing the hierarchy of equations for the joint probability density functions by replacing , for instance , the three body joint probability density function by its corresponding kirkwood superposition approximation .",
    "both techniques can be handled to produce results which are exact to first order in the particle density @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "here we use a technique based on a perturbative weak coupling expansion of the smoluchowski or fokker - planck equation for the @xmath6 particles in interaction .",
    "the form of this perturbation expansion is identical to that used to calculate the effective diffusion constant of a particle in a random potential .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the probability density function for the particle displacements from their original positions at @xmath21 at time @xmath22 , that is to say the density of @xmath23 .",
    "we take initial conditions @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are independently and uniformly distributed throughout the volume @xmath16 of the system . in principal one could take other initial conditions for the @xmath25 , notably one could take their equilibrium distribution .",
    "however if the system is ergodic then the resulting behavior of the diffusion effective constant should be independent of this distribution .",
    "the disorder induced by the random initial conditions shows the link with diffusion in a random potential .",
    "the forward fokker planck or generalized smoluchowski equation for @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gradient operator on @xmath29 where @xmath10 is the spatial dimension and @xmath6 the number of particles .",

    "* in the corresponding static approximation @xcite it was shown that the structure function is given by @xmath242 although the authors of @xcite express @xmath243 in terms of the mayer function of the potential @xmath16 , the result is the same at the order of accuracy of the calculation .",
    "we see that the condition above for a dynamic transition , defined by the vanishing of @xmath17 , coincides in the same approximation scheme by the appearance of a diverging correlation length and a second order phase transition .",
    "however as pointed out in @xcite this apparent second order transition may be preceded by a first order freezing transition when the free energy of the ordered crystal phase is lower than that of the free energy of the liquid phase described by the terms in the chain re - summed virial expansion .",
    "the analysis above thus may apply to a supercooled liquid and the temperature @xmath230 is the limit of the thermodynamic stability of the liquid phase .",
    "there has been some experimental evidence of a diverging correlation length at the vogel - fulcher - tammann temperature @xmath230 from the study of the dielectric susceptibility of supercooled liquids @xcite , though these results seem at odds with earlier numerical studies @xcite studying this question .",
    "in order to test the accuracy of the different schemes explained above , we have carried out monte carlo simulations of particles interacting via the potential ( [ potgauss ] ) in two dimensions .",
    "here we have fixed the density at the value @xmath244 , and the number of particles at @xmath245 .",
    "we have evaluated the macroscopic diffusion constant by using eq .",
    "( [ defk ] ) . the result is shown on fig .",

    "( [ eqkappas ] ) and ( [ eqkappas1 ] ( a ) , one - loop renormalization - group ( b ) , one - loop renormalization - group @xmath247 first two - loops diagram ( c ) and monte carlo simulations ( d ) . ]    from fig .",
    "( [ fig8 ] ) we see that the @xmath0-expansion is valid only at very small @xmath0 , however the one - loop rg result is much nearer the simulated values of the diffusion constant over quite a broad range .",
    "we expect that a rg analysis including more interactions , for example including functional renormalization of the interaction @xmath16 , would provide better agreement .",
    "the two - loop diagrams include the one indicated as type 1 in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the effect of the addition of this diagram to the one - loop rg calculation is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig8 ] ) as well .",
    "the other diagrams of the two - loop expansion are at least of order @xmath248 .",
    "hence , the good agreement observed indicates that the two - loop calculation which includes additional interactions will improve the approximation to the diffusion constant .",
    "we note that the value of the density used here ( @xmath244 ) is not very small , and the reasonably good agreement obtained is a hint that the rg calculation catches the @xmath1 dependence of the diffusion constant in the case of soft or bounded potentials .",
    "we have developed a perturbative expansion of the self - diffusion constant of langevin interacting particles .",
    "the expansion is a weak coupling expansion which is suitable for soft or bounded interaction potentials .",
    "the perturbation expansion can be seen to be a double expansion in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and we have shown how it can be dealt with diagrammatically . as an example of a partial re - summation of this expansion , a one - loop renormalization group analysis has been carried out and tested on a simple form of the interaction , and compared to numerical simulations . it was found that this calculation gives considerably better agreement than the straight expansion to @xmath249 .",
    "in addition , in some cases the one - loop rg calculation predicts a divergence of the relaxation time ( or vanishing of the self diffusion constant ) at some positive temperature .",
    "however we have seen that when such a dynamic transition occurs it is accompanied by a diverging correlation length in the statics when one uses equivalent approximations in the statics and dynamics .",
    "the possible forms of the divergence of the relaxation time have been discussed and it has been argued that the vogel - fulcher - tammann law emerges under relatively weak additional assumptions to the basic calculation carried out here . the two - loop calculation should provide a better quantitative approximation for the diffusion constant , but it would also indicate the form or robustness of the divergence of the relaxation time as higher - loop contributions are taken into account , this calculation is in progress .",
    "various other re - summation methods may be developed on the systematic perturbation expansion expounded here , as we have mentioned earlier the series may be re - summed at order @xmath1 to recover existing low density results , one may use self consistent perturbation theory and also explore renormalization group schemes based of calculating the effect of integrating out the effect of a small density of other particles rather than the fourier modes of the interaction potential ."
