    "there are many lattice models of a single polymer in solution that take account of different physical scenarios and capture different aspects of such a system , for example by modelling the inclusion of hydrogen bonding or stiffness .",
    "the first ingredient in these models is the type of lattice path that is considered .",
    "the simplest example is the unrestricted random walk , which is a lattice path that may visit sites and bonds of the lattice multiple times . on the other hand the classical model of polymers",
    "is based on the _ self - avoiding walk _ , which is a lattice path that can not visit either bonds or sites of the lattice more than once .",
    "there are however several configuration systems used that lie between these two extremes .",
    "one commonly used for modelling polymers is the self - avoiding trail , which is a lattice path that is bond avoiding but may visit sites multiple times .",
    "importantly , this path may both touch at a site , or may cross .",
    "consider the subset , @xmath1 , of @xmath2-step trails @xmath3 on the square lattice with the added restriction that no crossings are allowed .",
    "this is an important type of configuration since they appear in the high temperature expansion of the @xmath4 model on the square lattice ( see @xcite for a recent example ) .",
    "let us call these configurations _",
    "grooves_.    the second ingredient in a lattice model of polymers in solution is the set of interactions that are associated with various combinatorial features of the configurations . given a groove @xmath5 , we associate the following set of boltzmann weights : a weight @xmath6 for _ site interaction _ ,",
    "i.e.  for a site that the groove visits more than once , such as occuring in the interacting self - avoiding trail model ( isat ) , a weight @xmath7 for every straight segment , which moderates stiffness in the polymer , and finally a weight @xmath8 for each _ nearest - neighbour interaction",
    "_ , i.e.  for a pair of visited sites that are nearest - neighbours on the lattice but non sequential in the groove .",
    "this nearest - neighbour interaction occurs in the canonical interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model of polymer collapse .",
    "figure  [ fig : configuration1 ] shows an example of a configuration belonging to @xmath9 and its associated weights .",
    "steps with one ( @xmath10 ) collision , five ( @xmath11 ) straight segments , and four ( @xmath12 ) nearest neighbours .",
    "there are @xmath13 singly visited sites and @xmath14 doubly visited sites .",
    "the total weight of this configuration is @xmath15 . ]",
    "there has been long term interest in special cases of this model over and above the canonical isaw model , which has a weak second order phase transition between a high temperature expanded phase and a low - temperature phase .",
    "one can distinguish these phases for example by the different scaling of the size of the polymer as given by its radius of gyration .",
    "the associated exponent takes the value @xmath16 in the high - temperature phase and @xmath17 in the low - temperature phase . in the low temperature phase the polymer is disordered and dense , but not maximally dense : it has been described as a liquid - like disordered drop . the phase transition known as",
    "the @xmath18-point is conjectured in two dimensions to have a cusp singularity in a convergent specific heat with the associate finite length exponent @xmath19 .",
    "the size exponent at the transition is @xmath20 .",
    "the isaw model is realised by letting @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand setting @xmath23 and @xmath22 gives the so - called  vertex interacting self - avoiding walk \" ( visaw ) , which is a misnomer since the configurations are actually grooves ( as described above ) and not self - avoiding walks .",
    "this model first arose as a specialisation of an integrable lattice model introduced by blte and nienhuis in 1989 @xcite related to the izergin - korepin vertex model . in fact , that model included more generally a stiffness parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the model was studied numerically @xcite for various values of @xmath7 including @xmath22 .",
    "it has also been studied as part of a generalisation of the interacting self - avoiding trail model ( asymmetric isat ) that distinguishes collisions from crossings , using transfer matrix calculations @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo work @xcite concluded that the transition in the visaw @xmath24 would apparently seem to be a strong second order transition .",
    "the exponent describing the finite length singularity in the specific heat has been estimated @xcite as @xmath25 , which is in accord with the divergence seen in the isat model of @xmath26 @xcite , estimated from much longer configurations .",
    "the size exponent of visaw has not been measured using monte carlo , though the isat model has @xmath17 with a scaling form containing multiplicative logarithmic corrections : this clearly differs from the @xmath18-point isaw value of @xmath27 . in work on the asymmetric isat @xcite the low temperature phase of visaw ( with @xmath22 )",
    "was considered ; it was found to have a similar structure to the low temperature phase in the isat model .",
    "this low temperature phase is not the same as the globular , liquid - like phase in the low temperature region of isaw : for visaw and isat the low temperature phase is maximally dense , i.e.  every site of the path , apart from those on the outside of a dense ball , is associated with a doubly visited site of the lattice .    in contrast",
    ", setting @xmath28 excludes the possibility of straight segments and by also setting @xmath29 the model is known as interacting self - avoiding trails on the l - lattice ( _ lsat _ ) . note that by setting @xmath30 the trails do not cross themselves and so are actually _ grooves_. the model",
    "can also be mapped onto isaw on the manhattan lattice @xcite . a kinetic growth algorithm that produces long l - lattice trails maps to configurations with boltzmann weights",
    "@xmath31 : an analysis of simulations of very long configurations @xcite has shown that the transition is @xmath18-like with a weak second order transition with an exponent conjectured to be the same as the @xmath18-point value of @xmath19 .",
    "the scaling of the size of the polymer given by the radius of gyration or similar is described by the exponent @xmath20 .",
    "interestingly , the low temperature phase of the lsat model has not been previously considered .",
    "of course it has been implicitly assumed that it would be like the isaw model , i.e.  disordered and dense but not maximally dense .",
    "the parameter space of the semi - flexible visaw model ( @xmath29 ) also includes the special multi - critical point of the @xmath4 model found in @xcite , known as the blte - nienhuis point or bn - point .",
    "the location of this point is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "recently there have been various investigations of the bn - point itself @xcite . in the monte carlo work",
    "@xcite the size exponent was estimated as close to @xmath20 in agreement with earlier work @xcite . the specific heat exponent was not estimated and since the study looked at just that point the low temperature phase was not considered . very recently",
    ", a theoretical framework for the bn - point has been elucidated where it has been proposed that this point is related to a particularly unusual conformal field theory with continuous exponents @xcite .",
    "so while the semi - flexible visaw model has been studied previously by monte carlo at several values of @xmath7 , there are clearly some outstanding gaps in our knowledge . to gain a wider perspective",
    ", the generalised model we study here allows us to interpolate between the semiflexible visaw model and the canonical interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model directly .",
    "the set of @xmath2-step self - avoiding walks @xmath35 is a subset of grooves , @xmath36 .",
    "hence , if we set @xmath37 we suppress all multiple visits to sites and recover self - avoiding walks as configurations .",
    "we are now left with two boltzmann weights @xmath8 and @xmath7 which gives us the semi - flexible interacting self - avoiding walk model or semi - flexible isaw model .",
    "this model was studied on the square lattice in @xcite .    to present a phase diagram that can be readily compared to the data we describe below",

    "these two - dimensional @xmath0-sheets are actually parallel lines of polymer in the @xmath38 or @xmath39 directions .",
    "the extended and globular collapsed phases are separated by a line of weak second - order transitions .",
    "the @xmath18-point lies on this line and the conjecture is that the entire line belongs to the @xmath18-universality class . on the other hand the extended phase and @xmath0-sheet - like phase are separated by a line of first order transition points .",
    "according to @xcite , the @xmath0-sheet - like phase and the collapsed phase are separated by a line of second - order phase transitions associated with a positive @xmath40-exponent ( around @xmath41 ) and therefore a diverging specific - heat .    as can be seen from this summary of the models that are contained within our model",
    "there are very different transitions and different collapsed low temperature phases .",

    "our simulations were based on the flatperm algorithm @xcite which is a flat histogram version of the pruned and enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) developed in @xcite .",
    "the perm algorithm generates a polymer configuration kinetically , which is to say that each growth step is selected at random from all possible growth steps . during this process",
    "the algorithm keeps track of a weight factor to correct the sample bias . at each growth step ,",
    "configurations with very high weight relative to other configurations of the same size are duplicated ( or _ enriched _ ) while configurations with low weight or that can not be grown any further ( i.e. because they are  trapped \" or because they have reached a limit length ) are discarded ( or _ pruned _ ) .",
    "a single iteration is then concluded when all configurations have been pruned .",
    "the total number of samples generated during each iteration depends on the specifics of the problem at hand and on the details of the enriching / pruning strategy .",
    "this simple mechanism produces valid configurations with many steps very efficiently but introduces correlation between samples which are grown from a same smaller configuration .",
    "we keep account of these correlations in two ways : first , we count `` effective '' samples by the fraction of independent steps , and second , we run around 10 completely independent runs for each simulation to obtain an a posteriori measure of the statistical error .",
    "flatperm extends this method by cleverly choosing the enrichment and pruning steps to generate for each polymer size @xmath2 a quasi - flat historgram in some choosen micro - canonical quantities @xmath80 and producing an estimate @xmath81 of the total weight of the walks of length @xmath2 at fixed values of @xmath82 . from the total weight one",

    "we have found three low temperature phases as well as the normal high temperature extended phase that is dominated by the excluded volume effect .",

    "the phase transition between the extended and maximally dense phase is the most complicated and displays first order or second order characteristics depending on the parameters .",
