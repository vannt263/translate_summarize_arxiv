    "the single - electron states of a two - dimensional disordered electron gas in a strong magnetic field are localized except at the energies of the landau band centers .",
    "as the fermi energy approaches such a band center , a critical phenomenon takes place : the localization length diverges and the hall conductance jumps from one plateau to the next .",
    "this phase transition , which belongs to the general class of anderson metal - insulator transitions , has been seen in several experiments and a substantial amount of data on its critical behavior is available from a number of numerical simulations ( in the absence of electron - electron interactions ) , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "unfortunately , in spite of considerable efforts expended over the last decade , our analytical understanding of the plateau - to - plateau transition is still rather poor .",
    "it is expected that the critical behavior is described by some nonunitary conformal field theory , but this theory has not yet been identified .",
    "there exist two opposite limits from which the transition in the noninteracting system can be approached theoretically .",
    "the first limit is that of a slowly varying random potential with a correlation length @xmath5 much larger than the magnetic length @xmath6 . in this limit",
    ", the electron s motion can be described in semiclassical terms @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the motion separates into a rapid cyclotron motion superimposed on a slow guiding center drift along spatially localized equipotential lines . as the fermi energy approaches the center of a landau band , a percolating path develops and a localization - delocalization transition takes place .",
    "close to the transition , the quantum mechanical possibility for an electron to tunnel from an equipotential to a neighboring one is a relevant perturbation .",
    "the essential features of this quantum percolation transition were cast into a random network model by chalker and coddington @xcite . in their model",
    "an electron acquires random @xmath7 phases while moving along the directed bonds of a square network , and is scattered to the right or left every time it passes through a node of the network .",
    "the model will be reviewed in more detail below .",
    "suffice it to say here that the model has been studied by numerical simulation but has , in its original , spatially isotropic formulation , defied analytical treatment up to now , although a certain amount of analytical insight has come from consideration of its anisotropic @xcite and weak disorder @xcite versions .",
    "the opposite limit is @xmath8 .",
    "historically , this was the _ first _ limit to be studied analytically , the reason being that it is this limit that was amenable to the field theoretic machinery developed at the beginning of the 1980 s by wegner @xcite , efetov @xcite and others . starting from a gaussian white - noise potential @xmath9 pruisken",
    "@xcite used the replica trick to set up a generating functional for the disorder averaged retarded and advanced green s functions of the single - electron hamiltonian . after a hubbard - stratonovitch transformation to matrix - valued fields , he made a saddle - point approximation , valid in the limit of a high landau level .",
    "this was followed by a gradient expansion leading to a @xmath10 nonlinear @xmath2 model with a vanishing number of replicas , @xmath11 , and a parity - violating topological term due to the strong magnetic field .",
    "the coupling constants of the model , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , were identified @xcite with the physical conductivities of the 2d disordered electron gas .",
    "the topological coupling @xmath14 , by its very nature , has no effect on the equations of motion of the classical field theory , but _ does _ change both the hamiltonian and the symplectic structure and , consequently , the commutator of the quantum theory .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the nonlinear @xmath2 model , while generically being massive ( i.e. having a finite correlation length ) in two dimensions , becomes critical at @xmath15 .",
    "the vanishing of the mass gap corresponds to the appearance of delocalized states at the center of a landau band .",
    "thus , pruisken s model provided the right kind of scenario in which to develop a scaling theory of the plateau - to - plateau transition .",
    "a supersymmetric version of the model first appeared in @xcite .",
    "undeniably , pruisken s nonlinear @xmath2 model has served as a great inspiration to theory .",
    "one of its early successes was the @xmath12-@xmath13 flow that was conjectured from it @xcite and later verified by numerical and real experiments , see @xcite and references therein . in spite of this , pruisken s model or ,",
    "rather , its promoters have been criticized , see @xcite for a summary .",
    "for one thing , the model has never yielded any quantitative results for the critical behavior at the transition , and much less has it been solved .",
    "( the same statement applies to the general class of nonlinear @xmath2 models with a topological term .",
    "none of these has ever been solved , at least not directly . ) for another , even the derivation of the model is vulnerable to criticism : the validity of the saddle - point approximation that is made to eliminate the so - called massive modes , requires @xmath16 . although this inequality is satisfied for the bare ( or scba ) value of @xmath12 in the limit of a high landau level , the renormalized theory at @xmath17 is expected to have a @xmath12 of order unity or less .",
    "the cure proposed by pruisken was to _ assume _ the renormalizability of his model , and appeal to the rg flow to take the coupling constant @xmath12 from large to small values .",
    "however , such an assumption needs to be justified and , in fact , is not acceptable by current field theoretic knowledge , for pruisken s model apparently lacks the conformal structure that is required of a fixed point theory with a continuous symmetry in two dimensions .",
    "( in other words , the model , while definitely being critical at @xmath17 , does not possess the conservation laws expected of an infrared stable fixed point . )    two advances will be made in the present paper .",
    "the first is to establish a very close connection between pruisken s nonlinear @xmath2 model and the network model of chalker and coddington at criticality .",
    "we will show that the latter can be viewed as a lattice discretization of the former or , conversely , taking the continuum limit of the network model yields the @xmath2 model .",
    "a more detailed outline is the following .",
    "we start out by reviewing the supersymmetric version of pruisken s model and the chalker - coddington network model in secs .",
    "[ sec : pruisken ] and [ sec : cc_model ] .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec : susy ] , the network model is reformulated as a lattice - regularized field theory defined over efetov s supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath2 model space with unitary symmetry .",
    "this reformulation is exact .",
    "in contrast with the conventional method due to wegner , efetov and others , no saddle - point approximation is needed to eliminate the massive modes .",
    "moreover , sec .  [ sec : gl22_symmetry ] shows that not only is the supersymmetric reformulation of the network model defined over the same field space , but it also has the same global symmetries as pruisken s model . at the critical point of the network model , where the correlation ( or localization ) length diverges , the long wave length physics of the supersymmetric lattice theory is expected to be described by a continuum field theory .",
    "the symmetries dictate that this continuum theory be pruisken s model at the critical coupling @xmath18 . as is argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : sig_xx ] , the other coupling constant , @xmath12 , equals @xmath19 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath13 is checked in sec .",
    "[ sec : sig_xy ] , by evaluating the lattice action on a smooth field configuration with nonzero topological charge .",
    "[ sec : n_channels ] extends these results to an @xmath0-channel network model with random @xmath20 matrices on links .",
    "what we learn from all this is that , although historically pruisken s model was first obtained from the gaussian white noise limit @xmath21 , in a low landau level it is actually more closely related to the opposite limit @xmath22 , since it is the latter that provides the microscopic basis for the network model .",
    "the mathematical basis underlying the exact transformation from the @xmath0-channel network model to the supersymmetric lattice field theory is quite natural and simple , and is briefly sketched as follows .",
    "( readers who are not interested in mathematical structures may want to skip this paragraph . ) for a pair of positive integers @xmath23 consider the tensor product @xmath24 , on which the group @xmath25 acts by linear transformations .",

    "now put @xmath35 and fill the `` negative energy states '' to form @xmath36 .",
    "the particle - hole coherent states @xcite that are generated by the action of @xmath37 on @xmath38 , are holomorphic sections of a line bundle associated to the homogeneous space @xmath39 by the slater - determinant representation of @xmath40 on @xmath38 .",
    "they are parameterized by a complex @xmath41 matrix @xmath42 with adjoint @xmath43 . by combining the closure relation for particle - hole coherent states with a few elementary properties of fermi - coherent ( or grassmann - coherent ) states",
    ", one can prove the following equality of integrals : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are diagonal matrices with real entries , @xmath46 is the haar measure of a @xmath20 subgroup of @xmath47 , and @xmath48 expresses the @xmath49-invariant measure of a compact symmetric space @xmath50 contained in the complex homogeneous space @xmath51 .",
    "this integral identity forms the mathematical basis of our formalism .",
    "its supersymmetric extension @xcite permits to carry out the disorder average over the random @xmath20 matrices placed on the links of the network , at the expense of introducing an integration over fields @xmath42 taking values in a symmetric superspace .",
    "another issue addressed in this paper is the question whether the supersymmetric formulation of the network model offers the possibility for an exact analytical solution .",
    "[ sec : vertex ] reveals that the model resembles what is called a _",
    "vertex model _ in statistical physics , in the sense that the boltzmann weight is a product of factors , one for each node , or vertex .",
    "the weight associated with a single vertex is called the r - matrix .",
    "the symmetries of the r - matrix are investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetries ] . it is eventually found that it can be interpreted as a map @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an irreducible lowest - weight module for the lie superalgebra @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for the case of one retarded and one advanced green s function .",
    "this looks interesting as one may hope that @xmath56 can be deformed to an r - matrix that solves the quantum yang - baxter equation underlying the integrability of two - dimensional vertex models .",
    "one would then have the possibility of an analytical and exact computation of critical properties .",
    "unfortunately , the specific choice of local directions for the single - particle motion on the network , shown in fig .",
    "2 below , turns out to be _ incompatible _ with the standard schemes @xcite for constructing solutions of the quantum yang - baxter equation .",
    "the reason is that the r - matrix of a yang - baxter solvable model always transfers from one side of the vertex to the other , whereas the chalker - coddington vertex maps the horizontal degrees of freedom into the vertical ones , or vice versa .",
    "thus the chalker - coddington model in its original form does not fit into the canonical framework of the theory of integrable systems , and i am not aware of any method to make analytical progress with it .    however , this is not yet the end of the story .",
    "additional insight can be gained by considering the anisotropic limit @xcite of the chalker - coddington model .",
    "this limit and its relation to pruisken s model are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropic ] . based on it , sec .",
    "[ sec : integrable ] proposes a modified version of the isotropic one - channel network model , which differs from the original one in two respects .",
    "first , the direction of the single - particle motion does not alternate constantly between being horizontal and vertical . instead",
    ", an electron may either pass straight through a node ( with _ no _ change of direction ) , or else be scattered either to the right or to the left .",
    "analysing such a model by the mapping onto pruisken s nonlinear @xmath2 model , we find that it is likely _ not _ to be in the quantum hall universality class , but in a massive ( haldane type ) phase .",
    "therefore , a second modification is proposed , which is to add a second channel of propagation on _ half _ the links , say the horizontal ones , see fig .",
    "5b below . by the mapping onto pruisken s model",
    ", the doubly modified network model is expected to be critical in a range of values of the parameter characterizing the scattering at the nodes .",
    "moreover , by the changed transfer dynamics , the standard schemes for constructing solutions of the quantum yang - baxter equation are no longer ruled out .",
    "i hope to elaborate on this theme in a future publication .",
    "the original formulation @xcite of pruisken s nonlinear @xmath2 model relied on the use of the replica trick . when applied to phenomena that are nonperturbative in the disorder strength ,",
    "the replica trick is not mathematically sound but has been demonstrated to lead to incorrect results , at least in some instances @xcite .",
    "( the analytic continuation to a vanishing number of replicas is not unique in general . )",
    "fortunately , we can avoid the replica trick by using an alternative , supersymmetric formalism @xcite , which is on firm mathematical ground .",

    "thus , contrary to what might have been expected , pruisken s model at small @xmath110 is actually associated more closely with the _ high - field limit _ , @xmath544 , as it is this limit that provides the microscopic justification of the network model .",
    "note , however , that the ratio of microscopic length scales @xmath545 is expected to be an irrelevant parameter at a critical point with infinite correlation length . thus , our result is not in conflict with pruisken s derivation of the @xmath2 model model as a critical theory .    in my opinion , neither the chalker - coddington model nor pruisken s model hold much promise for an exact analytical solution in the near future . if so , the mapping of one model on the other is not yet a big step forward .",
    "the good news is that there are several useful spinoffs .",
    "d.k.k . lee and chalker suggested to model the random flux problem ( i.e. , the motion of a single electron in a random magnetic field ) by a network with two channels per link and local @xmath332 gauge invariance .",
    "our mapping onto a nonlinear @xmath2 model easily extends to include this case .",
    "the coupling constants of the continuum field theory were found to be @xmath546 at the symmetric point of the random flux problem .",
    "this is a massive theory with exponential decay of all correlation functions are large scales .",
    "thus , contrary to claims made in the literature , there is no room for truly extended states in the random flux problem , at least not by slight deformation away from the two - channel network model .",
    "this conclusion had already been reached in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another spinoff helps us along in our quest to understand the integer quantum hall transition .",
    "we observed that the susy reformulated chalker - coddington network model has the structure of what is known as a vertex model in statistical physics .",
    "motivated by information from the theory of integrable systems , we then modified the network model in several ways .",
    "first , we abandoned the alternating direction of the electron s motion along the horizontal and vertical straight lines of the network .",
    "instead , we took the direction of motion to be constant along every such line .",
    "the mapping onto pruisken s model indicates that this modification changes the physics : the value of the topological coupling now is @xmath547 , which corresponds to a noncritical state .",
    "we argued that criticality can be restored by doubling the number of channels on all horizontal links ( or on all vertical links ) .",
    "alternatively , we can spatially separate the two channels on horizontal links and return to a model with only one channel per link , at the expense of doubling the size of the unit cell in the vertical direction .",
    "the resulting modified network model is critical , but no longer has a justification from a microscopic picture of guiding center drift along equipotentials .",
    "its virtue is that the corresponding supersymmetric model is of a type for which systematic ways of constructing solutions of the quantum yang - baxter equation are in principle available .",
    "whether our model can actually be deformed into one that is a yang - baxter integrable , is a question whose answer lies far beyond the scope of the present paper .    _ acknowledgment .",
    "_ most of this work was done while the author was visiting the institute for theoretical physics , ucsb , santa barbara , and the aspen center for physics .",
    "useful discussions with john chalker , matthew fisher , andreas ludwig , boris muzykantskii and nick read are acknowledged ."
