    "relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models are quite successful in describing ground state properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter properties .",
    "they describe the nucleus as a system of dirac nucleons that interact in a relativistic covariant manner via mean meson fields @xcite or via mean nucleon fields @xcite whose explicit forms sometimes derive solely from the meson field approaches @xcite .",
    "the meson fields are of finite range ( fr ) due to meson exchange whereas the nucleon fields are of zero range ( contact interactions or point couplings pc ) together with derivative terms that simulate the finite range meson exchanges .",
    "there are a number of attractive features in the rmf - fr and rmf - pc approaches .",
    "these include the facts that the combined meson and/or nucleon fields account for the effective central potentials that are used in schrdinger approaches and that the physically correct spin - orbit potential occurs naturally with magnitudes comparable to the ( empirical ) _ ad hoc _ spin - orbit interactions required in schrdinger approaches .",
    "equally attractive is the fact that for relatively few parameters @xmath0 a vast amount of information is obtained : the dirac single - particle wave functions and corresponding energy eigenvalues , the ground state mass , the baryon and charge densities together with their moments , and the properties of saturated nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , these quantities are obtained simultaneously in the same self - consistent relativistic hartree ( or hartree - fock ) calculation .",
    "+ in this work we use mean nucleon fields constructed with contact interactions ( point couplings ) to represent the system of interacting dirac nucleons .",
    "we choose this approach for the following reasons : ( a ) possible physical constraints introduced by explicit use of the klein - gordon approximation to describe mean meson fields , in particular that of the ( fictitious ) sigma meson , are avoided and instead the effects of the various incompletely understood and higher order processes are assumed to be lumped into appropriate coupling constants and terms of the lagrangian , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( b ) the use of point couplings allows not only ( standard ) relativistic hartree calculations to be performed , but also relativistic hartree - fock calculations @xcite by use of fierz relations ( up to fourth order @xcite ) , and ( c ) the use of point couplings , because of their success in the nambu - jona - lasino model for the low - momentum domain of qcd @xcite , is perhaps the best way to test for _ naturalness _ of the coupling constants in the seminal weinberg expansion @xcite highlighting the role of power counting and chiral symmetry in weakening n - body forces .",
    "that is , two - nucleon forces are stronger than three - nucleon forces , which are stronger than four - nucleon forces , ... , resulting in a sequence making nuclear physics tractable .",
    "if the dimensionless coupling constants of the corresponding lagrangian are of order 1 ( _ natural _ ) then qcd scaling and chiral symmetry apply to finite nuclei .",
    "finally , ( d ) , the rmf - pc model allows one to investigate its relationship to nonrelativistic point - coupling approaches like the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approach and the rmf - fr approach to contrast the importance and roles of the different features these models have , as well as to obtain new insights .",
    "+ concerning point ( c ) , the aim of this paper is to determine whether qcd scaling and chiral symmetry apply to finite nuclei and , by their application , to construct a state - of - the - art parameterization of the relativistic mean - field point - coupling lagrangian . in the following",
    "we will use the term rmf model for both the version having finite range due to meson exchange , which we call rmf - fr , and the point - coupling ( contact interaction ) version that we denote by rmf - pc .",
    "+ concerning point ( d ) , it is important to note here that one can also view rmf - pc as an approach that lies in between the rmf - fr approach and the nonrelativistic skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approach which is also a well - developed self - consistent mean - field model that performs very well ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "whereas shf is based upon density - dependent contact interactions with extensions to gradient terms , kinetic terms , and the spin - orbit interaction , rmf - fr is based upon a coupled field theory of dirac nucleons and effective meson fields treated at the mean - field level , where density dependence is modeled by nonlinear meson self couplings and the role of gradient terms is taken over by the finite ranges of the mesons .",
    "the kinetic and spin - orbit terms are automatically carried in both rmf models @xcite .",
    "thus , a comparison of rmf - pc and shf addresses the differences between in - medium dirac and schrdinger nucleons , that is , in kinetic and spin - orbit components , whereas a comparison of rmf - pc and rmf - fr addresses the absence _ vs. _ presence of finite range and the different treatments of density dependence .",
    "herein we will perform these comparisons using precisely the same fitting strategy as in recent shf and rmf - fr adjustments @xcite except that here we will in addition be guided by considerations of qcd scaling and chiral symmetry , that is , _",
    "naturalness_. + we regard the present work with contact interactions as a refined relativistic point coupling model in comparison to our earlier work @xcite for the following three reasons .",
    "first , initial work in determining coupling constants in rmf - pc approaches @xcite found a high correlation among the ground state observables used to determine them , particularly the total binding energy and the root - mean - square charge radius .",
    "given this fact and the presence of quadratic , cubic , and quartic terms in the various densities appearing in the lagrangian ( representing two- , three- , and four - body interactions ) results in very delicate cancellations among the corresponding many - body forces .",
    "this means that determination of the coupling constants using a nonlinear least - squares adjustment algorithm with respect to the corresponding measured ground - state observables is fraught with difficulty because the coupling constants are generally underdetermined .",
    "consequently , the search for the minimum in the chi - squared hypersurface results in the location of many local minima from which erroneous conclusions can be drawn .",
    "herein we address this problem more completely by applying two different nonlinear least - squares adjustment algorithms and , finally , developing a combined adjustment algorithm that is used to determine our present results .",
    "second , in our initial work we considered only spherical even - even closed - shell nuclei or closed - subshell nuclei in both proton number z and neutron number n because , due to explicit omission of the pairing interaction , we allowed only orbital occupation probabilities of 0 or 1 . here , we introduce orbital occupation probabilities for both protons and neutrons through a standard bcs approach in which the proton and neutron pairing strengths are simultaneously determined with the coupling constants in the adjustment algorithm .",
    "third , most of our earlier work addressed the question of naturalness after the fact , that is , without consideration of the complete set of 10 possible lorentz invariants that may occur ( scalar , vector , pseudoscalar , axial vector , tensor , and the same coupled to isospin @xmath1 ) and without consideration of the qcd mass - scale ordering of the terms of the lagrangian .",
    "the former consideration is neccessary to properly pursue the question of naturalness while the latter consideration leads to , among other things , classification of the ( allowed ) terms of the lagrangian according to their relative strengths , which , of course , assists in its construction in the first place .",
    "we address , and remain cognizant , of both of these considerations in the various approaches presented here .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the lagrangian of our relativistic point coupling model , together with its variants , is given in sec .",
    "included are the corresponding relativistic hartree equations , expressions for the various densities and potentials appearing , and expressions for the calculated observables that are to be used in determining the coupling constants of the lagrangian .",
    "the approximations that we invoke are also stated here . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the determination of the coupling constants using four different least - squares adjustment algorithms with respect to well - measured ground state observables and the external constraint of always obtaining reasonable calculated values of the properties of saturated nuclear matter",
    ". a relatively new approach to the @xmath2 minimization has been developed and we explain how and why . our results are given in sec .",
    "first , we present comparisons of calculation and experiment for nuclei whose measured observables were used to determine the coupling constants .",
    "second , we present comparisons of predicted and measured observables for nuclei not used in determining the coupling constants .",
    "third , we compare our results to those of other rmf approaches .",
    "then we give our final nuclear matter predictions and we mention initial results obtained in calculating fission potential energy surfaces and properties of superheavy nuclei .",
    "we address the role of qcd scaling and chiral symmetry in sec .",
    "v where we test our final sets of coupling constants for _ naturalness _ and present the corresponding evidence obtained that qcd and chiral symmetry apply to finite nuclei .",
    "our conclusions and intentions for future work are given in sec vi .",
    "the elementary building blocks of the point - coupling vertices are two - fermion terms of the general type @xmath3 with @xmath4 the nucleon field , @xmath5 the isospin matrices and @xmath6 one of the 4x4 dirac matrices .",
    "there thus is a total of 10 such building blocks characterized by their transformation character in isospin and in spacetime .",
    "+ the interactions are then obtained as products of such expressions to a given order .",
    "the products are coupled , of course , to a total isoscalar - scalar term . by `` order ''",
    "we mean the number of such terms in a product , so that a second - order term corresponds to a four - fermion coupling , and so on . in second order only the ten elementary currents squared and contracted to scalars may contribute , but at higher orders there is a proliferation of terms because of the various possible intermediate couplings . + in analogy to the nonrelativistic skyrme - force models , one goes one step beyond zero range and complements the point - coupling model by derivative terms in the lagrangian , as e.g. @xmath7 .",
    "the derivative is understood to act on both @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "the derivative terms simulate to some extent the effect of finite range and there may be genuine gradient terms from a density functional mapping , as appears e.g. in electronic systems @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work we consider the following four - fermion vertices :"
