    "the coherent state model ( csm)@xcite describes in a realistic fashion three interacting bands , ground , beta and gamma , in terms of quadrupole bosons .",
    "the formalism was later extended @xcite by considering the octupole degrees of freedom .",
    "the most recent extension describes eight rotational bands , four of positive and four of negative parity .",
    "observable like excitation energies , intraband e2 and interband e1 , e2 and e3 reduced transition probabilities have been calculated and the results were compared with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the formalism works well for both near spherical and deformed nuclei excited in low and high angular momentum states .",
    "indeed , we considered all states with @xmath9 in both , the positive and the negative parity bands .",
    "signatures for a static octupole deformation in ground as well as in excited bands have been pointed out in several even - even nuclei .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend csm for the even - odd nuclei which exhibit both quadrupole and octupole deformation .",
    "the formalism concerning the excitation energies in the positive and negative parity bands is presented in sections ii and iii .",
    "the e1 and e2 transitions are considered in section iv , while the numerical application to four even - odd nuclei , is described in section v. the final conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "we suppose that the rotational bands in even - odd nuclei may be described by a particle - core hamiltonian : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a spherical shell model hamiltonian associated to the odd nucleon , while @xmath12 is a phenomenological hamiltonian which describes the collective motion of the core in terms of quadrupole and octupole bosons .",
    "this term is identical to that used in ref.@xcite to describe eight rotational bands in even - even nuclei .",
    "the two subsystems interact with each other by @xmath13 , which has the following expression : @xmath14 @xmath15 denotes the components of the @xmath16-pole ( with @xmath16=2,3 ) boson operator .",
    "the term @xmath17 is similar to the spin - orbit interaction from the shell model and expresses the interaction between the angular momenta of the odd - particle and the core .",
    "the last term is due to the rotational motion of the whole system , @xmath18 denoting the total angular momentum of the particle - core system .",
    "the core states are described by eight sets of mutually orthogonal functions , obtained by projecting out the angular momentum and the parity from four quadrupole and octupole deformed functions : one is a product of two coherent states : @xmath19 while the remaining three are polynomial boson excitations of @xmath20 .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are real numbers and simulate the quadrupole and octupole deformations , respectively . the vacuum state for the @xmath16-pole boson , @xmath23 , is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "the particle - core interaction generates a deformation for the single particle trajectories .",
    "indeed , averaging the model hamiltonian with @xmath20 , one obtains a deformed single particle hamiltonian , @xmath25 which plays the role of the mean field for the particle motion : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant determined by the average of @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath25 represents an extension of the nilsson hamiltonian by adding the octupole deformation term .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have shown that in order to get the right deformation dependence of the single particle energies , @xmath25 must be amended with a monopole - monopole interaction , @xmath28 , where the monopole coordinate @xmath29 is determined from the volume conservation restriction .",
    "this term has a constant contribution within a band .",
    "the constant value is , however , band dependent .    in order to find the eigenvalues of the model hamiltonian we follow several steps :    \\1 ) in principle the single particle basis could be determined by diagonalizing @xmath25 amended with the monopole interaction .",
    "the product basis for particle and core may be further used to find the eigenvalues of @xmath30 . due to some technical difficulties in restoring the rotation and space reversal symmetries for the composite system wave function ,",
    "this procedure is however tedious and therefore we prefer a simpler method .",
    "thus , the single particle space consists of three spherical shell model states with angular momenta @xmath31 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath32 and @xmath33 have the parity @xmath34 , while @xmath35 has a negative parity @xmath36 . due to the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction the odd particle from the state @xmath32",
    "can be promoted to @xmath33 and vice - versa .",
    "the octupole - octupole interaction connects the states @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath35 . due to the above",
    "mentioned effects , the spherical and space reversal symmetries of the single particle motion are broken . to be more specific , by diagonalizing @xmath30 ( 2.1 ) in a projected spherical particle - core basis with the spherical single particle state factors mentioned above",
    ", the eigenstates could be written as a projected spherical particle - core state having as single particle state factor a function without good rotation and parity symmetries .",
    "therefore , one could start with a coupled basis where the single particle state is a linear combination of the spherical states , where the mixing coefficients are to be determined by a least square fitting procedure as to obtain an optimal description of the experimental excitation energies .",
    "thus , instead of dealing with a spherical shell model state coupled to a deformed core without reflection symmetry , as the traditional particle - core approaches proceed , here the single particle orbits are lacking the spherical and space reversal symmetries and by this , their symmetry properties are consistent with those of the phenomenological core .",
    "\\2 ) we remark that @xmath20 is a sum of two states of different parities .",
    "this happens due to the specific structure of the octupole coherent state : @xmath37 the states of a given angular momentum and positive parity can be obtained through projection from the intrinsic states : @xmath38 the projected states of negative parity are obtained from the states : @xmath39 the angular momentum and parity projected states are denoted by : @xmath40 the factors @xmath41 assure that the projected states @xmath42 are normalized to unity .",
    "obviously the unnormalized projected states are denoted by @xmath43 . for the quantum number @xmath44",
    "we consider the lowest three values , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "note that the earlier particle - core approaches @xcite restrict the single particle space to a single @xmath46 , which results in eliminating the contribution of the octupole - octupole interaction .",
    "\\3 ) note that for a given @xmath47 , the projected states with different @xmath44 are not orthogonal .",
    "indeed , the overlap matrices :    @xmath48    are not diagonal . by diagonalization ,",
    "one obtains the eigenvalues @xmath49 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath50 , with @xmath45 and @xmath51 .",
    "then , the functions :    @xmath52    are mutually orthogonal .",
    "the norms are given by : @xmath53 for each of the new states , there is a term in the defining sum ( [ psiplmi ] ) , which has a maximal weight . the corresponding quantum number @xmath44 is conventionally assigned to the mixed state .",
    "\\4 ) in order to simulate the core deformation effect on the single particle motion , in some cases the projected states corresponding to different @xmath46 must be mixed up .",
    "@xmath54    the amplitudes @xmath55 can be obtained either by diagonalizing @xmath25 or , as we mentioned before , by a least square fitting procedure applied to the excitation energies .",
    "the energies of the odd system are approximated by the average values of the model hamiltonian corresponding to the projected states : @xmath56    the matrix elements involved in the above equations can be analytically calculated .",
    "note that due to the structure of the particle - core projected states , the energies for the odd system are determined by the coupling of the odd particle to the excited states of the core ground band .",
    "the approach presented in this section was applied for the description of the @xmath0 bands . however",
    ", this procedure can be extended by including the @xmath57 states in the space describing the deformed core .",
    "in principle the method presented in the previous section may work for the description of bands with the quantum number @xmath44 larger than @xmath59 .",
    "however the intrinsic reference frame for the odd system is determined by the deformed core and therefore one expects that this brings an important contribution to the quantum number @xmath44 . to be more specific",
    ", we can not expect that projecting out the good angular momentum from @xmath60 , a realistic description of the @xmath61 bands is obtained .",
    "therefore we assume that the @xmath58 bands are described by projecting out the angular momentum from a product state of a low @xmath44 single particle state and the intrinsic gamma band state .",
    "we recall that within csm , the states of the gamma band are obtained by projection from the intrinsic state : @xmath62 where the excitation operator for the gamma intrinsic state is defined as : @xmath63 the low index of @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ psiga ] ) is the the @xmath44 quantum number for the @xmath65 intrinsic state .",
    "thus , a simultaneous description of the bands with @xmath66 can be achieved with the projected states : @xmath67_{im},\\nonumber\\\\ \\varphi^{(\\pm)}_{im;3/2}&=&n^{(\\pm)}_{i,3/2}\\sum_{j}\\left(n^{(\\gamma,\\pm)}_{j}\\right)^{-1}c^{\\;\\;j_2~\\;\\;j~\\;i}_{-1/2\\;\\;2 \\;3/2}\\left[|n_2l_2j_2\\rangle\\otimes\\varphi^{(\\gamma;\\pm)}_j\\right]_{im},\\nonumber\\\\ \\varphi^{(\\pm)}_{im;5/2}&=&n^{(\\pm)}_{i,5/2}\\sum_{j}\\left(n^{(\\gamma,\\pm)}_{j}\\right)^{-1}c^{j_3~j~i}_{1/2\\;2\\;5/2}\\left[|n_3l_3j_3\\rangle\\otimes\\varphi^{(\\gamma;\\mp)}_j\\right]_{im}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expressions the notation @xmath68 with @xmath69 is used for the normalization factors of the projected states describing the ground and the gamma bands , respectively , of the even - even core .",
    "note that for each angular momentum @xmath70 the above set of three projected states is orthogonal .",
    "the energies for the six bands with @xmath8 are obtained by averaging the model hamiltonian ( [ hamodd ] ) with the projected states defined above . @xmath71",
    "the matrix elements of the particle - core interaction are given in appendix a",
    "for some @xmath72 bands , results for the reduced @xmath73 and @xmath74 transition probabilities are available .",
    "they are given in terms of the branching ratios : @xmath75 to describe these data we use the wave functions defined in section ii .",
    "we recall that the positive parity states are obtained by coupling the spherical shell model state @xmath32 or @xmath33 to a positive parity core with a small admixture of a state coupling @xmath35 and a negative parity core . on the other hand",
    "the negative parity states are given by coupling one of the states @xmath32 or @xmath33 to a negative parity core and a small component consisting in a product state of @xmath35 and a positive parity core - state .",
    "thus , the single particle e1 transition operator may connect the leading term of the initial state with the small component of the final state .",
    "one expects that the contribution of this term to the e1 transition is negligible comparing it with the contribution of collective dipole operator .",
    "therefore the dipole transition operator considered in the present paper is the boson operator : @xmath76 concerning the quadrupole transition operator , this has the structure : @xmath77 the branching ratio ( [ branch ] ) for the initial state @xmath78 is : @xmath79 ^ 2 .\\ ] ] here the initial and final states are mixture of different @xmath44 states as well as mixture of the @xmath46 states defined by eq.([psiplmi ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the transition operators between the basis states are given in appendix b@xmath80 .",
    "the results obtained in section ii have been used to calculate the excitation energies for one positive and one negative parity bands in three even - odd isotopes : @xmath1ra , @xmath2u and @xmath3pu .",
    "the parameters defining @xmath12 , as well as the deformation parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are those used to describe the properties of eight rotational bands in the even - even neighboring isotopes .",
    "the single particle states are spherical shell model states with the appropriate parameters for the @xmath81 region of the considered isotopes @xcite .",
    "our calculations for the mentioned odd isotopes correspond to the single particle states : @xmath82 . in order to obtain the best agreement between the calculated excitation energies and the corresponding experimental data , in the expansion ( [ psiplmi ] ) a small admixture of the states @xmath83 and",

    "the mixing amplitude of the states @xmath88 is negligible small .",
    "energies ( [ energ ] ) depend on the interaction strengths @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these were determined by fitting four particular energies in the two bands of different parities , i.e. @xmath91 . the results of the fitting procedure are given in table i. inserting these in eqs .",
    "( [ energ ] ) , the energies in the two bands with @xmath72 are readily obtained .",
    "@xmath92    the theoretical results for excitation energies , listed in tables ii and iii , agree quite well with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the levels for the three isotopes have been populated by different experiments .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 bands have been identified in @xmath1ra with the reaction @xmath93pb(@xmath94c,3n)@xmath1ra @xcite , in @xmath2u via a pickup reaction on a @xmath95u target , while in @xmath3pu with the so - called `` unsafe '' coulomb excitation technique @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the dominant @xmath44 component is @xmath72 while the dominant @xmath46 component is @xmath96 .",
    "to have a measure for the agreement quality , we calculated the r.m.s .",

    "it is interesting to mention that the spectrum of @xmath1ra has been measured by two groups @xcite by the same reaction , @xmath93pb(@xmath94c,3n)@xmath1ra .",
    "however they assign for the ground state different angular momenta , @xmath99 @xcite and @xmath100@xcite",
    ". in our approach both assignments yield good description of the data .",
    "however we made the option for @xmath99 since the corresponding results agree better with the experimental data than those obtained with the other option .",

    "the bands @xmath103 are obtained through projection from the product state @xmath104 while the bands @xmath105 originate from the intrinsic state @xmath106 . concerning the bands characterized by @xmath0 one could consider also the mixing of components with different k in the manner discussed in section ii . however",
    ", our numerical application suggests that such a mixing is not really necessary in order to obtain a realistic description of the available data .",
    "the calculated energies in the three bands are compared with the corresponding experimental data in fig.2 .",
    "the plotted values are collected in table iv .",
    "the states for @xmath5ra have been obtained in ref.@xcite by using the @xmath107 and @xmath108 reactions and the @xmath109 decay of @xmath5fr . the spectrum yielded by the mentioned experiments",

    "the usual notations for nucleon mass ( m ) and atomic number ( a ) were used . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from fig .",
    "2 we note that our approach reproduces the experimental energies ordering in the band @xmath112 .",
    "the energy split of the states @xmath113 is nicely described although the doublet is shifted down by an amount of about 50 kev . in the band @xmath114",
    "there exists an energy level which is tentatively assigned with @xmath115 .",
    "our calculations suggests that this level could be assigned as @xmath116 .",
    "no experimental data are available for the band @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "2 we gave however the results of our calculations for this band . note that the ordering for the lowest levels is not the natural one .",
    "however starting with @xmath118 the normal ordering is restored .",
    "it is interesting to note that the heading states for the bands @xmath119 and @xmath114 are almost degenerate .",
    "the same it is true for the lowest angular momenta states in their negative parity partner bands .",
    "the deviations r.m.s . for this nucleus is 23 kev .",
    "now we would like to comment on the parameters yielded by the fitting procedure , for the considered isotopes .",
    "except for @xmath2u , where both quadrupole - quadrupole and octupole - octupole interactions are attractive , the two interactions have different characters for the rest of nuclei . in the first situation the @xmath16 ( = 2,3)-pole moments of the odd nucleon and that of the collective core have different signs",
    ". in the remaining cases the two moments are of similar sign .",
    "we also remark the large strength for the @xmath120 interaction in @xmath5ra which is consistent with the fact that the neighboring even - even isotope exhibits a relatively large octupole deformation .",
    "indeed , according to ref.@xcite for this nucleus we have @xmath121 .",
    "the large value of the strength @xmath122 determines large mixing amplitudes of the states @xmath123 $ ] as well as of the states @xmath124 $ ] .",
    "indeed , the value obtained for this amplitude is : @xmath125 .",
    "another distinctive feature for @xmath5ra consists in the fact that the @xmath126 interaction strength has a sign which is different from that associated to other nuclei .",
    "in fact the repulsive character of this interaction in @xmath5ra is necessary in order to compensate the large attractive contribution of the @xmath120 interaction .",
    "further , we addressed the question whether one could identify signatures for static octupole deformation in the two bands . to this goal , in fig .",
    "3 , we plotted the energy displacement functions @xcite : @xmath127,\\label{delta}\\\\ e_{1,\\gamma}(i)&=&e(i+1)-e(i).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first function , @xmath128 , vanishes when the excitation energies of the parity partner bands depend linearly on @xmath129 and , moreover , the moments of inertia of the two bands are equal .",
    "thus , the vanishing value of @xmath128 is considered to be a signature for octupole deformation .",
    "if the excitation energies depend quadratically on @xmath129 and the coefficients of the @xmath130 ^ 2 $ ] terms for the positive and negative parity bands are equal , the second energy displacement function @xmath131 vanishes , which again suggests that a static octupole deformation shows up .",
    "the parities associated to the angular momenta , involved in @xmath131 are as follows : the levels @xmath70 and @xmath132 have the same parity , while levels @xmath70 and @xmath133 are of opposite parities .",
    "the results plotted in fig .",
    "3 correspond to @xmath3pu .",
    "we choose this nucleus , since more data are available .",
    "the plot suggests that a static octupole deformation is possible for the states with angular momenta @xmath134 belonging to the two parity partner bands .",
    "finally we calculated the branching ratio @xmath135 defined by eq.([branch ] ) , for @xmath1ra .",
    "there are two parameters involved which were fixed so that two particular experimental data are reproduced .",
    "the values obtained for these parameters are : @xmath136 where @xmath110 denotes the oscillator length characterizing the spherical shell model states for the odd nucleon .",
    "as shown in table v , the theoretical results agree reasonably well to the corresponding experimental data .",
    "our results show an oscillating behavior with maxima for the negative parity states .",
    "note that some off the data are well described while others deviate from the data by a factor ranging from 2 to 3 . in the third column of table",
    "v we listed the results obtained in ref.@xcite by a different model . in the quoted reference the ratios corresponding to positive parity states are almost constant and small .",
    "the spectra of the odd isotopes , considered here , have been previously studied in refs.@xcite using a quadrupole - octupole hamiltonian in the intrinsic deformation variables @xmath137 and @xmath138 separated in a kinetic energy , a potential energy term and a coriolis interaction .",
    "due to the specific structure of the model hamiltonian , an analytical solution for the excitation energies in the two bands of opposite parities was possible .",
    "it was shown that the split of the parity partner bands is determined by a combined effect coming from the coriolis interaction , which affects the @xmath139 bands , and a quantum number @xmath140 associated to the motion of a phase angle @xmath141 , characterizing both the quadrupole and the octupole deformation variables .",
    "based on analytical calculations , some conclusions concerning the @xmath142 values associated to the intraband transitions between states of similar parities , have been drawn . thus ,",
    "if the odd particle state is of positive parity , the transitions between positive parity states are enhanced with respect to those connecting negative parity states . if the parity of the odd particle state is negative the ordering of the mentioned transitions is reversed .",
    "comparison between the present formalism and that of ref .",
    "@xcite reveals the following features :    \\a ) having in mind the asymptotic behavior of the coherent states written in the intrinsic frame of reference @xcite , one may anticipate that the wave function describing the odd system from ref .",
    "@xcite , might be recovered in the asymptotic limit of the present approach . due to the fact that our formalism is associated to the laboratory reference frame",
    ", the coriolis interaction does not show up explicitly .",
    "the split of the states of different parities is determined by the matrix elements of @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction has different matrix elements in the space of positive parity states @xmath143 than in the space spanned by @xmath144 ( see ( 2.12 ) ) .",
    "note that the octupole - octupole interaction does not connect the states @xmath143 and @xmath144 but the diagonal elements corresponding to the mentioned states are different since so are the mixing amplitudes @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the _ spin - orbit _ like interaction is also very important in determining the band parity split .",
    "the set of angular momenta @xmath147 characterizing the core system , which participate in building up the angular momentum @xmath148 is very different from that involved in the structure of the state @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , summing the quantity @xmath150 $ ] with different weights for the parity partner states @xmath148 and @xmath149 and then comparing the results , one certainly obtains the energy split caused by the term @xmath17 . concluding , one may say that we identified three distinct sources generating a split for the parity partner states in the even - odd nuclei .",
    "while in ref.@xcite @xmath44 is a good quantum number here @xmath44 labels the leading component in an expansion characterizing a wave function with a definite angular momentum and a definite angular momentum z - projection , in the laboratory frame .",
    "thus , although one says that @xmath139 since the corresponding component in the above mentioned expansion prevails , the mixing of different @xmath44 components due to the single particle mixed states as well as due to the core projected states is considered in a natural manner .",
    "therefore , one expects that the complex structure of the model states might be suitable for the description of the transition probabilities between states from the two bands .",

    "the two formalisms are on a par with each other .",
    "\\c ) in general , the quadrupole - octupole boson descriptions overestimate the contribution to the system energy coming from the rotational degrees of freedom , since the euler angles defining the intrinsic reference frame are involved in both the quadrupole and octupole bosons .",

    "indeed , this has been used in ref.@xcite to describe simultaneously eight rotational bands , four of positive and four of negative parity . by contrast , in ref.@xcite the terms associated to the core are not appropriate for describing the complex structure of the even - even sub - system .",

    "values for the deviations of theoretical results from experimental data , reported in ref.@xcite , are 30 kev and 60 kev for @xmath2u and @xmath3pu , which are to be compared with 48.9 kev and 31.8 kev respectively , obtained with our approach .",

    "we treated simultaneously the bands with @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "moreover , a distinctive feature is the fact that here the bands with @xmath155 and @xmath61 are generated by coupling a single particle state to the states belonging to the @xmath65 band of the core system .",
    "in the previous sections we proposed a new formalism for the description of parity partner bands in even - odd nuclei . our approach uses a particle - core hamiltonian , with a phenomenological core described in terms of quadrupole and octupole bosons .",
    "the single particle space consists of three spherical shell model states , two of them having positive parity while the third one a negative parity .",
    "the particle - core coupling terms cause the excitation of the odd particle from one state to any of the remaining two .",
    "thus , the particle - core interaction might break two symmetries for the single particle motion , the rotation and space reflection , which , as a matter of fact , is consistent with the structure of the mean field obtained by averaging the model hamiltonian with a quadrupole and octupole boson coherent state . for @xmath72 bands the single particle states",
    "are coupled to the ground state of a deformed core while for @xmath156 the single particle states are coupled to the gamma intrinsic state .",
