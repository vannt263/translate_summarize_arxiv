    "magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ; polars and intermediate polars ) are bright x - ray sources because the highly supersonic [ free - fall velocity @xmath4 material raining down on the white dwarf primary passes through a strong shock where most of its kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy and the plasma is heated to a temperature @xmath5  mk .",
    "because of the magnetic funneling of the mass lost by the secondary , the factor - of - four density jump across the accretion shock , and the settling nature of the post - shock flow ( wherein the pressure is roughly constant and the density scales inversely with the temperature ; @xcite ) , the hot plasma in mcvs is expected to be dense . for a mass - accretion rate @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and a relative spot size @xmath8",
    ", the density of the flow immediately behind the shock is @xmath9 .",
    "the standard density diagnostic of high - temperature plasmas is the intensity ratio @xmath10 of the forbidden to intercombination lines of he - like ions @xcite , but this diagnostic is compromised in mcvs for two reasons .",
    "first , the critical density of this ratio increases with @xmath11 and hence temperature  the opposite of the trend in the accretion column  so the @xmath12 line ratio is effective over only a very narrow slice of the accretion column .",
    "second , in mcvs and other ultraviolet - bright stars , photoexcitation competes with collisional excitation to depopulate the upper level of the forbidden line , so the @xmath12 line ratio can appear to be in the `` high - density limit '' if the radiation field is sufficiently strong at the appropriate wavelengths : for a plasma illuminated by a 30 kk blackbody , the @xmath12 line ratios of all elements through mg lie in the high - density limit , regardless of the density @xcite .    to circumvent the density / photoexcitation ambiguity of the @xmath12 line ratio of he - like ions",
    ", we undertook an investigation of potential density diagnostics of lines of fe l - shell ions that are observable in the high quality _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) spectrum of the intermediate polar ex  hya @xcite . toward this end",
    ", @xcite investigated the density , temperature , and photoexcitation dependence of the @xmath13 line ratio of , and found that the anomalous ratio observed in ex  hya can be explained if the electron density of its @xmath14  mk plasma is @xmath15 or if the photoexcitation temperature @xmath16  kk . in this _",
    ", we investigate the density , temperature , and photoexcitation dependence of the @xmath17 line ratio of , which also is anomalous in ex  hya .",
    "we find that this line ratio is very insensitive to temperature and photoexcitation and that the observed ratio can be explained if the electron density of ex  hya s @xmath18 mk plasma is @xmath19 .",
    "the density sensitivity of the x - ray lines of have been discussed previously by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in studies of the x - ray spectra of solar and laboratory high - temperature plasmas .",
    "these diagnostics have not received more attention because of the relative weakness of emission lines ( the ionization fraction peaks at just 22% and is greater than 1% over the relatively narrow temperature range @xmath2026  mk ; @xcite ) , the relative weakness of @xmath21 lines for @xmath22 , and the fact that the critical densities of these transitions are of order @xmath23 , larger than the densities typically observed in the sun , tokamaks , and electron beam ion traps .",
    "we became interested in the density sensitivity of the @xmath24 lines of because the critical density of this transition is comparable to the lower limit of the electron density derived from the @xmath25 line ratio in the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya , and because the @xmath24 @xmath26 line ratio is anomalous ( the 11.92    line is unusually strong ) in the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya compared to that of the bright late - type binaries hr 1099 , capella , and @xmath27 crb ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively ) .    before wading into the details , we refer the reader to figure  1 , which illustrates the origin of the density dependence of the spectrum . at low densities ( @xmath28 ) ,",
    "the electron population is primarily in the @xmath29 ground state , and collisional excitations are predominantly from the ground state into the @xmath30 manifold ( 8 levels total ) and the @xmath31 level , both of which decay primarily to ground , producing lines in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) ( @xmath32217   ) and at 11.77   , respectively .",
    "however , these levels also decay to the @xmath33 first - excited level with approximately 15% probability , producing lines in the euv ( @xmath34349   ) and at 11.93   ; when _ that _ level decays to ground , it produces a line in the ultraviolet ( uv ) ( @xmath35   ) . as the density increases ( @xmath36 ) , electron population builds up in the @xmath33 first - excited level because the m1 transition to ground is slow ( @xmath37 ) . at high densities ,",
    "the @xmath33 first - excited level is fed primarily by radiative decays from the @xmath30 manifold .",
    "collisional excitations out of the first - excited level are primarily into the @xmath38 level , which decays primarily back to the first - excited level , producing a line at 11.92   .",
    "consequently , the 11.92    line is relatively strong in the x - ray spectra of high - density plasmas .    to calculate quantitative models of the x - ray spectrum of",
    ", we employed the livermore x - ray spectral synthesizer ( lxss ) , a suite of idl codes that calculates spectral models of highly charged ions based on hebrew university / lawrence livermore atomic code ( hullac ) atomic data .",
    "hullac calculates atomic wavefunctions , level energies , radiative transition rates @xmath39 , and oscillator strengths @xmath40 according to the fully relativistic , multiconfiguration , parametric potential method @xcite .",
    "electron impact excitation rate coefficients are computed quasi - relativistically in the distorted wave approximation @xcite assuming a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "our model includes electron impact excitation rate coefficients and radiative transition rates for e1 , e2 , m1 , and m2 decays for levels with principal quantum number @xmath41 and azimuthal quantum number @xmath42 for a total of 228 levels . using these data",
    ", lxss calculates the level populations for a given temperature and density assuming collisional - radiative equilibrium ; the line intensities are then simply the product of the level populations and the radiative decay rates .    in a preliminary report , we @xcite used lxss to calculate the x - ray spectrum of for electron densities @xmath43 to @xmath44 and electron temperatures @xmath45 , 12.8 , and 25.5 mk ( @xmath46 , 1 , and 2 times the temperature at which the ionization fraction peaks ; @xcite ) . at the resolution of the _ chandra _ hetg ,",
    "the @xmath31@xmath29 line at 11.77    is blended with the ( _ very _ much weaker ) @xmath38@xmath29 line at 11.76   , and the @xmath38@xmath33 line at 11.92    is blended with the ( much weaker ) @xmath31@xmath33 line at 11.93   , so we report as @xmath0 the ratio of the sum of these blends .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite shows that this line ratio has a critical density @xmath47 , is approximately 0.3 at low densities and 1.4 at high densities , and has only a weak temperature dependence .",
    "motivated by the detailed study of @xcite of the density - sensitive fe lines in the euv spectrum of the high - density frascati tokamak upgrade plasma , for this _ letter _ we investigated the effect on the @xmath48 line ratio of two modifications to the collisional excitation data used in lxss .",
    "first , we investigated the effect of replacing , for all transitions between and among the @xmath49 and @xmath30 levels of , the electron impact excitation rate coefficients computed with hullac with those of @xcite , computed with the relativistic r - matrix method . at @xmath50 mk , the zhang & pradhan electron impact excitation rate coefficients are larger than those of hullac by 1.95 for the @xmath29@xmath33 transition , 0.921.70 ( average 1.27 ) for the eight @xmath29@xmath30 transitions , 1.053.23 ( average 1.55 ) for the eight @xmath33@xmath30 transitions , and 0.458.99 ( average 2.20 ) for transitions between levels within the @xmath30 manifold ( but only 1.001.02 for the four @xmath49@xmath51 transitions ) . despite the significant differences between these excitation rate coefficients",
    ", we find that for @xmath52 mk the @xmath53 line ratio increases by 7% at @xmath54 , but the low- and high - density limits are unaffected .",
    "second , we investigated the effect of adding proton excitations for transitions among the levels of the @xmath49 and @xmath30 configurations .",
    "this was accomplished by fitting the proton impact excitation rate coefficients of @xcite to an expression of the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the proton impact excitation rate coefficient in units of @xmath57 , and we have assumed that the proton and electron temperatures are equal . adding proton excitations to the lxss population kinetics calculation under the assumption that the proton number density @xmath58 ( as is appropriate for a high - temperature plasma with solar abundances ) , we find that for @xmath52 mk the @xmath59 line ratio increases by 19% at @xmath60 , and the high - density limit increases by 7% to approximately 1.5 .    with both of these modifications to lxss , we recalculated the x - ray spectrum of for electron densities @xmath43 to @xmath61 and electron temperatures @xmath45 , 12.8 , and 25.5 mk .",
    "the upper panel of figure  2 shows that the model @xmath62 line ratio has a critical density @xmath63 , is approximately 0.3 at low densities and 1.5 at high densities , and has only a very weak temperature dependence .      to investigate the effects of photoexcitation on the @xmath64 line ratio",
    ", we added to the lxss population kinetics calculation the photoexcitation rates @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the spectrum of the photoexcitation radiation field .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that @xmath67 ( i.e. , the radiation field is that of a blackbody of temperature @xmath68 ) and the dilution factor of the radiation field is equal to @xmath69 ( i.e. , the x - ray emitting plasma is in close proximity to the source of the photoexcitation continuum ) . with these assumptions , we used lxss to calculate the x - ray spectrum of for an electron temperature @xmath70 mk , electron densities @xmath71 to @xmath44 , and photoexcitation temperatures @xmath72 , 40 , 60 , 80 , and 100 kk .",
    "the lower panel of figure  2 shows that below @xmath73 kk the @xmath0 line ratio has essentially no photoexcitation dependence , but as the photoexcitation temperature increases the line ratio increases at low electron densities and the critical density shifts to higher densities , while the high - density limit is unaffected .",
    "compared to the @xmath74 line ratio , the @xmath0 line ratio is insensitive to photoexcitation because the @xmath29@xmath33 transition in the uv is not optically allowed ( @xmath75 ) and the @xmath29@xmath30 transitions lie at such short wavelengths in the euv .",
    "the _ chandra _ hetg / acis - s observation of ex  hya was performed between 2000 may 18 @xmath76 and may 19 @xmath77 ut for a total exposure of 59 ks .",
    "extraction of the grating spectra and calculation of the effective area files was accomplished with the ciao 2.1 suite of software using the reprocessed data products and new calibration data files ( version r4cu5upd8 ) for sequence 300041 .",
    "various aspects of this spectrum have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite ; here we discuss only a tiny portion ( @xmath7812.05   ) of the medium - energy grating ( meg ) spectrum as it bears on the relative strengths of the @xmath79 emission lines .",
    "this spectrum is shown in figure  3 , where the ordinate is in units of @xmath80 , the wavelength bin width @xmath81   , and we have combined @xmath82 first order counts .",
    "this portion of the spectrum contains the 11.77 and 11.92    emission lines of as well as the 11.74    emission line of .    to determine the flux in these emission lines",
    ", we fit the meg spectrum over the @xmath8312.05    wavelength interval with a model consisting of a linear background ( to account for the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum obvious in the broadband spectrum ) and three gaussians . assuming a common gaussian width , the fitting function @xmath84/\\sqrt{2\\pi } a_3 $ ] . to perform the fit",
    ", we separately accounted for @xmath82 first orders and used @xmath81    bins , so there were 180 data points and 171 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the resulting fit , combining @xmath82 first orders , is shown by the thick histogram in figure  3 .",
    "it gives @xmath85 and fit parameters as follows : gaussian width @xmath86 m  and line wavelengths and fluxes @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , where the errors on the wavelengths are @xmath82 12 m  and all errors are @xmath90 ( 68% confidence ) for one interesting degree of freedom .",
    "formally ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the @xmath91 line ratio equals @xmath92 ( 68% confidence ) , but this propagation of errors ignores a subtle interplay between the error bars of the numerator and denominator of this ratio . to generate more rigorous values for the error bars of this ratio",
    ", we used a monte carlo technique with @xmath93 realizations to determine that the observed @xmath94 line ratio equals 1.06 and the errors are @xmath95 ( 68% confidence ) , @xmath96 ( 90% confidence ) , and @xmath97 ( 99% confidence ) . this best - fit line ratio and these error envelopes",
    "are shown superposed on both panels of figure  2 .",
    "figure  2 shows that the combination of our lxss models and _ chandra _ hetg spectrum places significant constraints on the density of the @xmath98 mk plasma in ex  hya .",
    "specifically , allowing for a factor - of - two uncertainty in the electron temperature , the upper panel of figure  2 shows that the electron density @xmath99 at 68% confidence , @xmath100 at 90% confidence , and @xmath101 at 99% confidence .",
    "conversely , the lower panel of figure  2 shows that the electron density can be arbitrarily low if the photoexcitation temperature @xmath102  kk , but that alternative is excluded by uv observations of ex  hya .",
    "first , assuming that the distance to ex  hya is 100 pc , that the radius of its white dwarf is @xmath103 cm , that its 1010    flux density equals @xmath104 @xcite , and that 100% of this emission is due to a 100  kk hotspot ( i.e. , assuming that the white dwarf , accretion disk , and accretion curtains do not radiate in the uv ) , the fractional emitting area of the spot is approximately 0.5% , far smaller than is inferred from optical and uv light curves of mcvs .",
    "second , fits to ex  hya s uv spectrum yield effective temperatures @xmath105  kk @xcite , far lower than that required to produce the anomalous @xmath0 line ratio via photoexcitation .",
    "to date , four different spectroscopic diagnostics have provided evidence of high densities in the x - ray  emitting plasma of the intermediate polar ex  hya .",
    "@xcite used the line ratio of the / 133  blend to the 129    line observed in the 1994 _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ spectrum of ex  hya to infer @xmath106 under the assumption that the plasma temperature @xmath107  mk . using the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya , mauche ( 2002 ) showed that the he - like ion @xmath12 line ratios of o , ne , mg , si , and s are all in their high - density limit",
    "; @xcite used the @xmath108 line ratio to infer @xmath15 for its @xmath14  mk plasma ; and we here used the @xmath0 line ratio to infer @xmath19 for its @xmath109 mk plasma .",
    "of these diagnostics , the line ratio is the most reliable because it has the highest critical density and is the least sensitive to temperature and photoexcitation .",
    "we conclude first that the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya requires plasma densities that are orders of magnitude greater than those typically observed in the sun or other late - type stars , and second that the @xmath62 line ratio [ like the @xmath108 line ratio ] is a useful density diagnostic for sources like mcvs in which the plasma densities are high and the efficacy of the he - like ion density diagnostic is compromised by the presence of a bright uv continuum .",
    "finally , we note that our density determinations for ex  hya are consistent with those expected for plasma in the accretion column , where @xmath110 .",
    "additional density diagnostics are needed to begin to map the temperature / density profile of the accretion column of this and other mcvs .",
