    "the previous discussion shows that this is not the case for @xmath4 and thus we expect the problem to appear for some intermediate value of @xmath1 that is unfortunately unknown .",
    "we have decided to be conservative and we have simply assumed that for all values of @xmath1 the spread of the approximants is an unreliable estimate of the error .",
    "thus , in table  [ summaryd3nv ] that summarizes our final results , the error we report for @xmath39 is the difference between the final result and the value of the interpolation .",
    "this method provides a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty in the large-@xmath1 limit , but , for the reasons we mentioned above , we believe it overestimates the errors in the small-@xmath1 region ( this is evident in the @xmath4 case ) .",
    "of course , the two - dimensional estimates of @xmath39 may have the same problem . in this case",
    "however the spread of the approximants is larger and includes @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , whatever method we use , we get essentially the same error bars .",
    "the same analysis can be repeated for @xmath37 , which is estimated from @xmath181 in this case the @xmath178 term has the correct sign .",

    "we have studied the small - renormalized - field expansion of the fixed - point effective potential in the symmetric phase of three - dimensional o(@xmath1 ) models .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion are related to the zero - momentum @xmath5-point renormalized couplings @xmath182 . by properly rescaling the effective potential one may re - express the small - field expansion in terms of the ratios @xmath21 with @xmath183 , cf .",

    "when , as in the case of the ratios @xmath25 , the quantity at hand is expected to be analytic and smooth as a function of @xmath33 , one may use exact results ( or precise estimates ) for lower - dimensional o@xmath184 models in order to constrain the analysis of the corresponding @xmath3-expansion .",
    "for this reason we have computed the first few @xmath25 exactly in one and zero dimensions for all values of @xmath1 and we have estimated the same quantities in two dimensions for @xmath4 from the high - temperature series of refs . @xcite .",
    "the constrained analyses of the available @xmath3-series of @xmath25 , according to the procedure outlined in sec .
