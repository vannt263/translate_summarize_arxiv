    "observations of decrease of starlight by a transit of an extrasolar planet is one of the important method not only for finding the planet itself but for determining physical parameters of the transiting planet @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", there are two observables in the transit light curve : duration and depth .",
    "the latter gives the planet radius if the star radius is known , while the former leads to the planet orbital radius if one neglects the size and mass of the planet for the transit duration and the orbital velocity of the planet , respectively .",
    "there is often observations of the orbital velocity and the period of the transit using the doppler effects in addition to the transit observation @xcite .",
    "hence the planet mass can be determined uniquely , since the inclination is known to be near edge - on from the transit    to date , hundreds of the extrasolar planets are observed by various methods mostly by doppler method and transits , but those with a large orbital radius more than @xmath010 au are limited by these methods .",
    "this is because one could see the transit practically only once , at most , in one s life time , and such planets are also difficult to detect with the doppler method .",
    "as the distance between the star and the planet becomes larger , the mass of the planet could in principle affect the transit light curve due to microlensing effect .",
    "microlensing with occultation has been considered generally or in other context @xcite .",
    "it makes the depression shallower , and steepens the slope of the ingress and egress of the dip @xcite .",
    "however , the former can be explained by a smaller planet radius , while the latter could be due to a faster transiting velocity .",
    "a peculiarity of the microlensing effect on the transit light curve would be ` rising spikes ' just before and after the transit.this is what we focus on in the present article , and we show that the height of the spike has different parameter dependence from other observables such as the depth of the light curve",
    ". in particular , it could be measurable in high precision observations such as by _ kepler _ or other future facilities .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider both microlensing and occultation simultaneously to obtain the magnification of the starlight .",
    "we see typical observables from the transit light curve , and define a novel observable as the ` rising spike ' in the lensed case in sec .  3 , so that we consider three observables : the depth , the duration , and the rising spike .",
    "in sec.4 , we show that the section of isosurfaces of these three observables will determine the physical parameters of the planet : the mass , the radius , and the orbital radius . in sec .  5",
    ", we include the limb darkening as an example effect which may obscure the rising spike .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "appendices are devoted to the other sections of the isosurfaces of three observables , and the other cases for lensing and occultation in the aligned situation .",
    "the lens equation for a point mass is written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an angular separation between the lens and the image of the source , while @xmath3 is that between the lens and the source without lensing ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "@xmath4 is the einstein angle , @xmath5 which represents an effective size of the lens . here",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the distance from the observer to the source and the lens , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the distance between the lens and the source .",
    "@xmath9 is the lens mass , @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath11 is the speed of light . solving eq.([lens - eq ] ) , we obtain the solutions @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the angle of the image whose light comes from the far ( near ) side of the lens , which we will call it @xmath14 path hereafter .    [",
    "fig : lens_eq ]        the magnification of the light of a point on the source star through the @xmath15 path is given by @xmath16 since the surface brightness is conserved .",
    "in the case of microlensing , one can not discriminate these two magnified images separately , so the observed magnification should be the addition of the two as @xmath17 since the source is usually an extended object , integrating over the source , we can obtain the total magnification as @xmath18 so far we have considered only the point mass lens . because we are interested in the observation of the transit of a planet in front of the source star , we need to investigate the finite size effect of the lens planet .",
    "there are three cases : ( 1 ) both @xmath19 and @xmath20 paths of the light from a certain point on the source star are occulted , ( 2 ) @xmath20 path is occulted , or ( 3 ) neither path is occulted . therefore , when integrating over the source star in the numerator of eq.([mag ] ) , we must use @xmath21 itself for case ( 3 ) , @xmath22 for case ( 2 ) instead of @xmath21 , or do not integrate over the region where case ( 1 ) holds .    in the simple configuration that the centres of the lens planet and the source star are aligned",
    ", one can calculate the magnification very easily .",
    "the denominator of eq.([mag ] ) is estimated as @xmath23 as usual .",
    "here @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radius of the source star .",
    "in order to calculate the numerator in the transit case when the occultation occurs , we must specify the condition to hold .",
    "the occultation takes place if @xmath26 , where @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the radius of the lens planet ( see case i in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] ) .",
    "it leads to @xmath29 , which implies that the size of the planet is bigger than that of the lens .",
    "therefore , there is full occultation in the region @xmath30 , while @xmath20 path is shielded for @xmath31 .",
    "thus the numerator of eq.([mag ] ) is obtained as @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath34 ,   \\label{amp}\\ ] ] where the tilde denotes the variable normalised with respect to @xmath35 such that @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "notice that this magnification ( or , more precisely , the diminution ) corresponds to the depth at the centre of the transiting light curve . for other situations , see appendix a.    in order to follow the whole process of the transit , we integrate numerically the numerator of eq.([mag ] ) to estimate the magnification .",
    "we show some example of the light curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] . here",
    "we take @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 au , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the jupiter mass and radius , respectively . for parameters of the source star",
    ", we set , here and hereafter , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45  pc when calculating numerically .",
    "we should mention that @xmath6-dependence is very weak for @xmath46 .",
    "also notice that , in this article , we restrict ourselves to the edge - on case in order to focus on the effect of lensing .    , while the horizontal axis shows the time in day from the centre of the transit in the case of the circular orbit .",
    "we take @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 au for the lens planet , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45  pc for the source star . ]",
    "during the transit a light curve of a star drops down due to the occultation .",
    "we can see how much it drops down and how long it lasts .",
    "these are the depth and duration of the transit , respectively , and the only observables we can obtain from the light curve ( in a simplest case ) . if we measure the depth at the center of the transit , it is estimated as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the orbital radius of the planet around the star .",
    "once the parameters of the star ( @xmath28 and @xmath6 ) are known , it could be a function of @xmath28 and @xmath49 : @xmath50 .",
    "on the other hand , the duration of the transit is determined as @xmath51 where the planet is assumed to revolve in a circular orbit around the mass center of the star and the planet , and has orbital velocity @xmath52 .",
    "again , if the parameters of the star ( @xmath9 , @xmath28 , and @xmath6 ) are known , it becomes a function of @xmath9 , @xmath28 , and @xmath49 : @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath9 could be much smaller than @xmath54 to be neglected , we can derived physical parameters @xmath28 and @xmath49 from the transit observables @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "usually the transit observation is not the only information in our hands .",
    "orbital velocity and/or orbital period of the planet is obtained from the doppler observation , and three physical parameters are all determined .",
    "neither orbital velocity nor orbital period has been observed by doppler method if the planet rotates around the star with relatively large orbital radius , typically farther than @xmath010 au .",
    "in such a situation , the gravitational lensing effect becomes larger as the lens planet goes away from the star ( see eq.([e_radius ] ) ) .",
    "the gravitational lensing is known to affect the light curve of the transit in such a way that the depth becomes shallower and the slopes of the ingress and the egress becomes steeper , but the former effect on the light curve can be mimicked by the smaller planet radius , while the latter may imply the faster orbital velocity of the planet .",
    "therefore , one can not tell if it is really affected by the gravitational lensing . in order to confirm that one must surely take into account the gravitational lensing effects",
    ", their peculiar feature should be observed in the light curve .",
    "here we claim that the ` rising spike ' is the smoking gun of the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "it is the rise in the light curve just before the ingress ( or just after the egress ) of the transit , shown as @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_lens ]",
    ". there are several key points that the rising spike is a good observable for determining the physical parameters of the planet .",
    "first of all , it is a unique consequence of the gravitational lensing effect , and can not be mimicked by others .",
    "the effect could be observed in high precision observation such as the _ kepler _ , especially when the orbital radius is relatively large , where the orbital velocity can not be observed .",
    "for parameter determination , it has different parameter dependence from the depth or duration of the transit @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite a unique observable .",
    "the amplitude of the rising spike can be calculated from the magnification of the light at the moment when the lensed shadow of the planet has just been tangent to the star as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tangent ] .",
    "it is thus given by @xmath58 where all the angular separations are normalized with respect to @xmath35 such as @xmath59 , and @xmath60,\\ ] ] with @xmath61        since the image of the source star is not occulted through @xmath19 path while fully occulted through @xmath20 path , we can easily calculate @xmath57 using the magnification of the @xmath19 path for a point mass lens @xcite as @xmath62 k(k )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{6 mm } \\left .",

    "are modified due to the gravitational lensing effect . from eq.([amp ] ) , the depth is now estimated as @xmath70 .",
    "\\label{delta}\\ ] ] while the duration is given by @xmath71 therefore , these two observables are functions of @xmath28 , @xmath9 , and @xmath49 : @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "notice that they reduce to the unlensed case ( [ delta_nolens ] ) and ( [ tau_nolens ] ) , respectively , for vanishing lens mass , @xmath74 , which implies @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "now we have the depth ( [ delta ] ) , the duration ( [ tau ] ) , and the rising spike ( [ xi ] ) , which depend differently on the three physical parameters of the planet such as the mass @xmath9 , the radius @xmath28 , and the orbital radius @xmath49 .",
    "if these three observables are measured , we can reversely use these equations to determine three physical parameters . although it could be done in principle , the inverse problem is practically difficult .",
    "however , we could numerically obtain the isosurfaces of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 in three dimensions of @xmath9 , @xmath28 , and @xmath49 .",
    "intersection of these three surfaces must be a point , the solution that we need .    figure  [ fig : iso_m ] shows sections of the isosurfaces of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath41 from the top panel to the bottom , respectively .",
    "red , green , and blue lines represent the sections of isosurfaces of the rising spike @xmath57 , the depth @xmath55 , and the duration @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "shaded region denotes where @xmath79 , which we do not consider because we focus on the transit observation .",
    "since their parameter dependences look quite different in the section with constant @xmath9 , one could derive the physical parameters @xmath9 , @xmath28 , and @xmath49 from the figure .",
