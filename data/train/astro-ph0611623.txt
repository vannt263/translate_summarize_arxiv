    "it was pointed out in @xcite that an ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff of a field theory should be set by an infrared ( ir ) cutoff in order that the quantum zero - point energy of a system should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size .",
    "recent studies on the so - called holographic dark energy are based on this observation . in the original paper @xcite , using the hubble scale as the ir cutoff , one obtains a vacuum energy density comparable to the present day dark energy . unfortunately it was later pointed out in @xcite that the resulting equation of state for dark energy does not match the data . however , one of the present authors ( li ) @xcite suggested that in cosmological applications , the ir cutoff should be set by the future event horizon .",
    "this suggestion , combined with the simplest assumption that dark energy is given by the vacuum energy , provides a possible solution of the three problems on cosmological constant @xcite , namely , why the cosmological constant is not large , nonzero , and comparable to the matter energy density at the present time .",
    "following @xcite , if one choose the future event horizon as the ir cutoff , the vacuum energy density is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a constant to be determined by data fitting of the experiments . both theoretical reasoning and",
    "data fitting suggest @xmath1 is of order @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 is the future event horizon , the boundary of the volume a fixed observer may eventually observe : @xmath4 where @xmath5 .    in cosmological applications ,",
    "this vacuum energy density ( [ hdedef ] ) should couple with gravity and be added to the energy density term in the friedmann equation . it can cause the late time acceleration of the universe as a component of dark energy .    as have pointed out by li @xcite , if the holographic dark energy drives the late time acceleration of the universe , then it should also affect inflation @xcite .",
    "it is shown that at roughly 60 e - folds before the end of inflation , the holographic dark energy becomes comparable with the inflaton energy in energy density .",
    "so the holographic dark energy should induces corrections to the standard inflation at long wave lengths , these may be observable at the largest scales of the cmb spectrum . to study how the holographic dark energy affects inflation and",
    "the cmb spectrum is the main aim of this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss in more detail the dynamics of the holographic dark energy during inflation and during the post - inflationary epoch . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the perturbations and the scalar power spectrum .",
    "we perform a model - independent analysis of the effect of the holographic dark energy .",
    "we find that it leads to a upper bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "some inflation models such as the @xmath6 monomial model satisfy this requirement , while other models such as the @xmath7 monomial model and the small field inflation models should be modified to coexist with the holographic dark energy .",
    "the ir cutoff set by the future event horizon is physically natural and agrees empirically with the late time acceleration .",
    "however , it is still unknown in first principle by what mechanism the ir cutoff sets the uv cutoff and the vacuum energy",
    ". some other kinds of ir cutoff as well as the linear combinations of them have also been considered for cosmological purpose@xcite . in section 4",
    ", we consider other ir cutoffs other than the future event horizon , namely , ir cutoffs set by the particle horizon and the hubble scale .",
    "we find that for the case of particle horizon , the corrections during inflation is almost the same as the future event horizon case . while the ir cutoff set by the hubble scale seems problematic since the corrections fail to decay .",
    "we end with the conclusions and discussions in section 5 .",
    "for simplicity , we consider inflation driven by a single minimally coupled inflaton field .",
    "the friedman equation is @xmath8    we assume that the holographic dark energy does not couple to the inflaton .",
    "then the equation of motion of the inflaton is not affected by the existence of the holographic dark energy , @xmath9    > from ( [ phieom ] ) and the time derivative of ( [ friedman ] ) , we derive another equation @xmath10    and we impose the usual slow - roll conditions , @xmath11 the validity of these slow - roll conditions will be discussed later in this section .    in the inflation models without holographic dark energy ,",
    "the background equations turns into pure algebraic equations by using slow roll approximation . while when we take holographic dark energy into consideration , as @xmath3 is non - local in the scale factor , we still have to solve a system of differential equations . in @xcite , a convenient method to solve the equations",
    "is carried out by taking @xmath12 as the unknown function . the friedman equation ( [ friedman ] ) is rewritten as @xmath13 combining the definition of @xmath3 and @xmath14 with ( [ friedmanol ] ) , we have the differential equation @xmath15 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath16 .    the solution of ( [ ol ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath17 when @xmath18 . in the @xmath19 limit ,",
    "the above equation ( [ ceq1solution ] ) reduces to @xmath20 , in agreement with @xcite .    for the @xmath21 case",
    ", @xmath22 the @xmath21 case has a smooth @xmath18 limit , which agrees with ( [ ceq1solution ] ) .",
    "a divergence occurs at @xmath23 .",
    "it is due to the big rip singularity in the phantom - like cosmology when @xmath24 .",
    "it can be shown that when @xmath19 , it also scales as @xmath25 , the same as in the @xmath18 case .",
    "we present the numerical solutions in fig.[fig : bgevolution ] , where we give one example in each class ( @xmath18 , @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "note that @xmath18 is a natural value of @xmath1 , @xmath27 is the best fit value for sn+cmb+bao@xcite , and @xmath28 is taken for comparison . in @xcite , there are best fit values from other experiments such as @xmath29 from x - ray gas mass fraction of rich clusters , the solution behaves qualitatively the same in each class .",
    "we observe that when @xmath30 , the universe will undergo a long holographic dark energy dominated period given a dark energy dominated initial condition . while once the inflaton takes a significant part in the energy density , it will quickly become dominating . in the @xmath24 case ,",
    "the critical point lies at @xmath23 instead of @xmath31 .",
    "it is due to the divergence at @xmath23 in ( [ cneq1solution ] ) .",
    "note that in this figure we have assumed the inflaton energy stays constant .",
    "a more rigorous calculation should take the time variation of @xmath32 into account .",
    "other background quantities such as @xmath33 and @xmath32 during inflation can be calculated using @xmath14 by ( [ friedmanol ] ) and ( [ phieom ] ) .",
    "since it seems difficult to give an initial condition of @xmath14 from first principle , we determine @xmath14 by experiments . from the wmap experiment@xcite ,",
    "@xmath34 in the present time .",
    "this can help to fix an initial condition for @xmath14 during inflation .",
    "it can be shown that in the radiation dominated and matter dominated epochs , the scaling property of @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "then , from the number of e - folds@xcite , @xmath37 when we assume that the reheating happens immediately after the inflation , and the reheating period is short enough , we get the initial value of @xmath35 , @xmath38 translated into @xmath3 , this is @xmath39 it is very sensitive to @xmath40 , the reheating temperature .",
    "we will see that the above relation provides a constraint on the reheating temperature , after combined with the effect of the holographic dark energy on the spectral index .    before calculating the perturbations ,",
    "let us pause to discuss the validity of the slow - roll conditions . from ( [ ol ] )",
    "we get @xmath41 so @xmath14 is a slow - roll quantity only when @xmath42 . in the @xmath24 case , @xmath43 can satisfy the slow - roll condition as well . then from friedman equation in flat space @xmath44 we conclude that @xmath45 is a slow - roll quantity only when @xmath19 or @xmath46 ( and @xmath47 when @xmath24 ) . for a intermediate value of @xmath14 , either @xmath48 or @xmath49 slow - roll condition ( or both of them )",
    "is broken .",
    "in the following , we mainly consider the limit when @xmath14 is small enough not to spoil the slow - roll conditions .",
    "although the slow - roll regime does not take a large part in the whole parameter space , it is interesting enough from the experimental point of view .",
    "it is because as we will see in the following sections , the existence of the holographic dark energy produces a rather red spectrum .",
    "a slow - roll inflation with a small part of holographic dark energy already conflicts with the cmb experiment if this regime lies in the observable part of inflation . what we are interested in is to give a constraint of the upper bound of holographic dark energy at the beginning of the observable inflation .",
    "this constraint can be translated into a constraint on the reheating temperature .",
    "so to study the slow - roll regime is enough for our purpose .",
    "since the holographic dark energy depends only on the background quantities , it does not seem to produce its own perturbations .",
    "so the standard perturbation equations @xcite stay unchanged .",
    "> from these equations , and use the equation ( [ phieom ] ) , we can get the diagonized equation for @xmath50 in the longitudinal gauge , @xmath51 where @xmath50 is the perturbation of the metric , @xmath52    let @xmath53 , then the equation for @xmath54 reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the conformal time and @xmath57    it takes the form of a bessel equation . as usual , we can write down its solution and determine the normalization constants by the usual procedure .    in order to compare with the cmb experiments , it is useful to single out a conserved quantity after horizon crossing .",
    "the usual comoving curvature perturbation is not conserved when the holographic dark energy is present during inflation .",
    "it is because the inflaton field fluctuates while the holographic dark energy does not , then the perturbation is not adiabatic . in this case",
    ", we can use a nearly conserved quantity instead ( for a derivation of the general nearly conserved quantity in a slow - roll inflation , see @xcite ) , @xmath58 with the power spectrum @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the time of the last scattering surface .",
    "since the holographic dark energy decays fast , where to put the upper bound of the integration is not important .",
    "the spectral index takes the form @xmath61    now let us derive a model - independent formula for the corrections to the spectral index produced by the holographic dark energy . since the slow roll parameter @xmath62 depends only on the form of the inflaton potential and the hubble constant , it is not influenced by the holographic dark energy .",
    "the inflaton potential is set by the model , so is not affected by the existence of the holographic dark energy .",
    "the hubble constant is calculated backwards @xmath63 e - folds from the final condition of inflation .",
    "as we will see , at the time later than that of @xmath63 during inflation , the holographic dark energy should not affect the evolution of the universe .",
    "so the hubble constant at @xmath63 is also not changed whether the holographic dark energy exists or not .",
    "when @xmath14 is small , the slow roll parameter @xmath48 can be decomposed into    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the original contribution in the inflation models without the holographic dark energy , and @xmath66 is a correction term .",
    "the spectral index can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the standard contribution from the single field inflaton models without the holographic dark energy .",
    "therefore , we see that the effect of the holographic dark energy is to make the spectrum redder .",
    "note that from experiment we do not expect too red a spectrum , there is a constraint from the experiment on @xmath69 .",
    "the constraint can be translated into a constraint on the hubble constant during the inflation and the reheating temperature by ( [ rhnum ] ) .",
    "a constraint @xmath70 is shown in fig.[fig : treh ] .",
    "if we suggest further that @xmath71 , then the constraint on the reheating temperature is @xmath72 the equation ( [ tconstraint ] ) tells us that the energy scale during the last @xmath63 e - folds of inflation should drop three orders of magnitude .",
    "this provides a constraint on the inflation models flavored by the holographic dark energy .        for the monomial potential @xmath73 ,",
    "if we assume inflation ends at roughly @xmath74 , @xmath32 can be expressed as a function of the e - folding number as @xmath75 so the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath76 can be expressed as @xmath77    for example , the @xmath78 model gives @xmath79 , so for this model other mechanism is needed to be consistent with the existence of the holographic dark energy . while the @xmath80 model has @xmath81 , which is consistent with the existence of the holographic dark energy .    for the small field inflation models , @xmath82 , the energy scales do not change much during inflation .",
    "so the small field inflation models are not favored by the existence of the holographic dark energy .    we do not need to worry about the late time entropy perturbation , because the entropy perturbation decays fast with the decay of the holographic dark energy .",
    "it is also an interesting issue whether and how the ir cutoff set by the future event horizon affect the observed cmb spectrum . in @xcite , it has been studied in a simple toy model how the finiteness of the future event horizon influences the angular power spectrum , especially the low @xmath83 behavior . since the boundary conditions studied in @xcite",
    "are not respected during the expansion of the universe , we take a slightly different treatment : we simply cut off the primordial spectrum and set the primordial spectrum to zero when @xmath84 is larger than the present future event horizon .",
    "when @xmath84 is smaller than the present future event horizon , the primordial spectrum is not modified .        for illustrative purpose ,",
    "we show in fig.[fig : cmb ] the cmb power spectrum with and without the contribution of holographic dark energy , as well as with and without the late time ir cutoff .",
    "the parameter for the holographic dark energy sector is chosen as the best fit value of sn+cmb+bao@xcite . in fig.[fig : cmb ] , we take a large correction from holographic dark energy as an example .",
    "such a large correction conflicts with the experimental data , and as shown in fig.[fig : treh ] , it is in the  not acceptable \" region .",
    "now we have seen that even a small amount of holographic dark energy can produce a rather red spectrum , which can give a constraint on the reheating temperature @xmath40 . to have a better understanding of the whole picture , here we also present a simple ( and crude ) estimate for the regime where the holographic dark energy is dominate or of the same order as the energy density of the inflaton .",
    "as discussed in the last section , in this regime , the slow - roll approximation breaks down . according to @xcite , even for the fast rolling we can still take @xmath85 just like the slow - roll inflation case , where @xmath86 is the frozen amplitude of the inflaton field fluctuations outside the horizon .",
    "the existence of the holographic dark energy results in a larger hubble constant , so the fluctuations generally becomes larger in this regime .",
    "this implies that the power spectrum was made redder by a large holographic dark energy in the early stage of the inflation .",
    "therefore , the observed fluctuations of the inflaton should be created during the slow - roll regime .",
    "although the ir cutoff set by the future event horizon is theoretically natural and experimentally interesting , there are other candidates of ir cutoffs .",
    "the arbitrariness comes from the lack of knowledge of the holographic principle .",
    "so in this section , we consider as well two other kinds of ir cutoffs , namely , the particle horizon and the hubble scale , even though for these two cases the equation of state for dark energy does not agree with data .",
    "note that the perturbation equations ( [ purteom ] ) and ( [ bessel ] ) still hold for these two cases .    for the particle horizon case , the formulae are similar to the case with the future event horizon . the particle horizon is defined as @xmath87 and the vacuum energy density is given by @xmath88    the friedman equation takes the form @xmath89    take derivative respect to the equation ( [ phfriedman ] ) , and use ( [ phieom ] ) , we can get @xmath90    for the background equations expressed by @xmath14 , we have @xmath91 where @xmath14 is the ratio of the vacuum energy density to the critical density in the particle horizon case .    as in the future event horizon case , we can get the nearly conserved quantity , @xmath92 with the power spectrum @xmath93 and the spectral index @xmath94    the spectral index can be split into two parts each related to the usual slow - roll inflation and to the holographic dark energy @xmath95 obviously the presence of the holographic dark energy makes the spectrum redder .",
    "the vacuum energy density during inflation can be calculated similarly to the future event horizon case .",
    "if we assume that the vacuum energy related to the particle horizon is of the same order compared with the matter density in the present time , then we have at the e - folds @xmath63 before the end of inflation , @xmath96 .",
    "so the ir cutoff set by @xmath97 gives a similar , but slightly redder spectrum than the future event horizon case .",
    "finally , let s consider the ir cutoff set by the hubble scale .",
    "the vacuum energy density is set to @xmath98    the friedman equation can be written as , @xmath99 and as usual we can get the following equation on @xmath100 @xmath101    although @xmath18 may be the most natural value of @xmath1 , we note that @xmath18 forces both the kinetic and potential energy of @xmath32 vanish .",
    "a small departure from @xmath18 leads to a smaller required value of @xmath32 for a given hubble constant during inflation .",
    "it is not surprising since the ir cutoff set by @xmath33 can be think of as a redefinition of the planck mass , and a smaller effective planck mass ( i.e. a stronger gravitational coupling ) leads to a smaller required value of the inflaton to drive inflation .",
    "however , when we consider the perturbations and calculate the spectrum , the difference is not simply a rescaling of planck mass .",
    "this is because just as in the future event horizon case , the vacuum energy produced by holographic principle depends nonlocally on the hubble constant , so the vacuum energy do not produce perturbation by itself .",
    "the nearly conserved quantity takes the form @xmath102 with the power spectrum @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant of the dimension of energy .",
    "the spectral index can be written as @xmath105    note that the power spectrum is suppressed from the usual one by a factor @xmath106 .",
    "if we take @xmath104 as the planck scale or the string scale , the problem of a hierarchy of scales during inflation can be solved or eased by this kind of ir cutoff .",
    "but @xmath104 can not be determined as usual by the final condition of inflation . because the models with this kind of ir cutoff have a non - decaying correction from the holographic dark energy . as a toy model",
    ", it can not come back to the standard inflation models .    therefore , to take the hubble scale as the ir cutoff is problematic .",
    "the long - lived entropy perturbation is produced .",
    "we need extra mechanism for the entropy perturbation to decay . and",
    "furthermore , the post inflationary period is problematic because the non - decaying large correction to the standard picture may modify some exactly known results such as the nucleosynthesis .",
    "one possible solution is to assume that the holographic bound for the vacuum energy is not saturated for a large portion of the history of the universe . in @xcite ,",
    "such a possibility is investigated .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper , a detailed study on the effects of the holographic dark energy to the inflation is carried out .",
    "we find that the corrections on the spectral index generally make the scalar primordial power spectrum redder than that without the holographic dark energy . in order that the perturbations do not become too large to conflict with the experiments , a constraint on the reheating temperature",
    "the constraint is that the energy scale should drop three orders of magnitude during the last @xmath63 e - folds of inflation .",
    "as we take the monomial potential for inflation for example , the @xmath80 model satisfies the requirement while the monomial @xmath78 model and the small field inflation models have to add extra mechanism to live with the holographic dark energy . in our discussion",
    ", we assume that the reheating happens right after the end of inflation , it could be interesting to consider the case of late - time reheating .",
    "we compared the ir cutoff set by the particle horizon and the hubble scale during inflation with that by the future event horizon .",
    "we find that the cutoff set by the particle horizon provide a similar but slightly redder power spectrum than the one produced in the future event horizon case .",
    "the cutoff set by the hubble scale seems problematic since the correction does not decay during the whole evolutionary history of the universe , which may spoil some exactly known results .",
