    "the current experimental data on neutrino mass differences and neutrino mixing angles clearly indicate new physics beyond the so far successful standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "in particular , neutrino oscillations imply that at least two generations of neutrinos must be massive .",
    "therefore , one needs to extend the sm to incorporate neutrino mass terms .",
    "we have explored  @xcite the simplest version of a supersymmetric extension of the sm , the well known minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , extended by right - handed majorana neutrinos and where the seesaw mechanism of type i  @xcite is implemented to generate the small neutrino masses . for simplicity , as a first step , we focus here in the one generation case .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that heavy majorana neutrinos , with a majorana mass scale @xmath4 , induce large lfv rates  @xcite , due to their potentially large yukawa couplings to the higgs sector . for the same reason , radiative corrections to higgs boson masses due to such heavy majorana neutrinos could also be relevant .",
    "consequently , our study has been focused on the radiative corrections to the lightest mssm @xmath5-even @xmath6 boson mass , @xmath0 , due to the one - loop contributions from the neutrino / sneutrino sector within the mssm - seesaw framework .    in the following we briefly review the main relevant aspects of the calculation of the mass corrections and the numerical results .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite , where also an extensive list with references to previous works can be found .",
    "the mssm - seesaw model with one neutrino / sneutrino generation is described in terms of the well known mssm superpotential plus the new relevant terms given as : @xmath7\\,+\\ , { \\frac{1}{2}}\\,\\hat n \\,{m_m}\\,\\hat n \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the additional superfield that contains the right - handed neutrino @xmath9 and its scalar partner @xmath10 .",
    "there are also new relevant terms in the soft susy breaking potential : @xmath11    after electro - weak ( ew ) symmetry breaking , the charged lepton and dirac neutrino masses can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the neutral higgs scalars , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    the @xmath16 neutrino mass matrix",
    "is given in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 by : @xmath19 diagonalization of @xmath20 leads to two mass eigenstates , which are majorana fermions with the respective mass eigenvalues given by : @xmath21 in the seesaw limit , i.e. when @xmath22 , one finds , @xmath23    regarding the sneutrino sector , the sneutrino mass matrices for the @xmath5-even , @xmath24 , and the @xmath5-odd , @xmath25 , subsectors are given respectively by @xmath26 the diagonalization of these two matrices , @xmath27 , leads to four sneutrino mass eigenstates . in the seesaw limit , where @xmath18 is much bigger than all the other scales",
    "the corresponding sneutrino masses are given by : @xmath28 finally , in the interaction lagrangian that is relevant for the present work , there are terms already present in the mssm : the pure gauge interactions between the left - handed neutrinos and the @xmath29  boson , those between the left - handed sneutrinos and the higgs bosons , and those between the left - handed sneutrinos and the @xmath29  bosons . in addition , in this mssm - seesaw scenario , there are interactions driven by the neutrino yukawa couplings ( or equivalently @xmath17 since @xmath30 ) , as for instance @xmath31 , and new interactions due to the majorana nature driven by @xmath18 , which are not present in the case of dirac fermions , as for instance @xmath32 .",
    "besides , the higgs boson sector in the mssm - seesaw model is as in the mssm .",
    "in the feynman diagrammatic ( fd ) approach the higher - order corrected @xmath5-even higgs boson masses in the mssm , denoted here as @xmath0 and @xmath33 , are derived by finding the poles of the @xmath34-propagator matrix , which is equivalent to solving the following equation @xcite : @xmath35 \\left[p^2 - m_{h}^2 + \\hsi_{hh}(p^2 ) \\right ] - \\left[\\hsi_{hh}(p^2)\\right]^2 = 0~ , \\label{eq : proppole}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the tree level masses .",
    "the one loop renormalized self - energies , @xmath37 , in can be expressed in terms of the bare self - energies , @xmath38 , the field renormalization constants @xmath39 and the mass counter terms @xmath40 , where @xmath41 stands for @xmath42 .",
    "for example , the lightest higgs boson renormalized self energy reads : @xmath43    regarding the renormalization prescription , we have used an on - shell renormalization scheme for @xmath44 and @xmath45 mass counterterms and @xmath46 tadpole counterterms . on the other hand , we have used a modified @xmath47 scheme @xmath48 for the renormalization of the wave function and @xmath49 .",
    "the m@xmath47 scheme is very similar to the well known @xmath47 scheme but instead of subtracting the usual term proportional to @xmath50 one subtracts the term proportional to @xmath51 , hence , avoiding large logarithms of the large scale @xmath52 . as studied in other works  @xcite , this scheme minimizes higher order corrections when two very different scales are involved in a calculation of radiative corrections .",
    "the full one - loop @xmath53 corrections to the self - energies , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , entering  ( [ eq : proppole ] ) have been evaluated with _ feynarts_@xmath57 and _ formcalc _  @xcite .",
    "the new feynman rules for the @xmath53 sector are inserted into a new model file .",
    "since we are interested in exploring the relevance of the new radiative corrections to @xmath0 from the neutrino / sneutrino sector , we will present here our results in terms of the mass difference with respect to the mssm prediction .",
    "consequently , we define , @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the pole for the light higgs mass including the @xmath53 corrections ( i.e.  in the mssm - seesaw model ) , and @xmath0 the corresponding pole in the mssm , i.e without the @xmath53 corrections . thus , for a given set of input parameters we first calculate @xmath0 in the mssm with the help of feynhiggs  @xcite , such that all relevant known higher - order corrections are included . then we add the new contributions from the neutrino / sneutrino sector and eventually compute @xmath60 .",
    "we have obtained the full analytical results for the renormalized higgs boson self - energies and their expressions in the seesaw limit . in order to understand in simple terms the analytical behavior of our full numerical results",
    "we have expanded the renormalized self - energies in powers of the seesaw parameter @xmath61 : @xmath62 the zeroth order of this expansion is precisely the pure gauge contribution and it does not depend on @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it corresponds to the result in the mssm .",
    "the rest of the terms of the expansion are the yukawa contribution .",
    "the leading term of this yukawa contribution is the @xmath63 term , because it is the only one not suppressed by the majorana scale .",
    "in fact it goes as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes generically the electroweak scales involved , concretely , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in particular , the @xmath69 terms of the renormalized self - energy , which turn out to be the most relevant leading contributions , separated into the neutrino and sneutrino contributions , read :    @xmath70{$h$ } \\dashline(55,25)(70,25){3 } \\text(72,25)[l]{$h\\,+$ } \\arrowarc(40,25)(15,0,180 ) \\text(40,46)[b]{$\\nu_l$ } \\arrowarc(40,25)(15,-180,0 ) \\text(40,4)[t]{$\\nu_r$ } \\end{picture }   \\end{array } } \\mbox{~~ } { \\begin{array}{c } \\begin{picture}(70,40 ) \\dashline(10,25)(25,25){3 } \\text(8,25)[r]{$h$ } \\dashline(55,25)(70,25){3 } \\text(72,25)[l]{$h$ } \\dasharrowarc(40,25)(15,0,180){3 } \\text(40,46)[b]{${\\tilde \\nu}_l$ } \\dasharrowarc(40,25)(15,-180,0){3 } \\text(40,4)[t]{${\\tilde \\nu}_r$ } \\end{picture }   \\end{array } } \\,\\,\\right|_{{m_d}^2 p^2 } \\sim \\frac{g^2 p^2 { m_d}^2 c^2_{\\alpha}}{64 \\pi^2   { m_w}^2 s^2_{\\beta } } + \\frac{g^2 p^2 { m_d}^2 c^2_{\\alpha}}{64 \\pi^2   { m_w}^2 s^2_{\\beta } } .\\ ] ]    notice that the above neutrino contributions come from the yukawa interaction @xmath71 , which is extremely suppressed in the dirac case but can be large in the majorana case .",
    "the sneutrino contributions come from the new couplings @xmath72 , which are not present in the dirac case .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that these terms , being @xmath73 , depend on the external momentum .",
    "therefore , at large @xmath18 , to keep just the yukawa part is a good approximation , but to neglect the momentum dependence or to set the external momentum to zero are certainly not . in consequence ,",
    "the effective potential method will not provide a realistic result for the radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "similarly , obtaining the leading logarithmic terms in a rge computation , would also miss these finite terms .",
    "the behaviour of the renormalized self - energy with all others parameters entering in the computation have been discussed in  @xcite . according to our detailed analysis in this paper ,",
    "the most relevant parameters for our purposes are : @xmath18 ( or , equivalently , the heaviest physical majorana neutrino mass @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 and the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the literature",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath18 has a very large value , @xmath78 , in order to get @xmath79 0.1 - 1 ev with large yukawa couplings @xmath80 .",
    "this is an interesting possibility since it can lead to important phenomenological implications due to the large size of the radiative corrections driven by these large @xmath81 .",
    "we have explored , however , not only these extreme values but the full range for @xmath18 : @xmath82 .       to summarize : for some regions of the mssm - seesaw parameter space , the corrections to @xmath0 are of the order of several gev . for all soft susy - breaking parameters at the tev scale",
    "we find correction of up to @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "these corrections are substantially larger than the anticipated ilc precision of about @xmath83 ( and also larger than the anticipated lhc precision of @xmath84 ) .",
    "consequently , they should be included in any phenomenological analysis of the higgs sector in the mssm - seesaw .",
