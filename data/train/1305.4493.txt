    "at subatomic scales matter is structured into particles , but the interpretation of phenomena related to nuclear collective motions in atomic nuclei , refers to a continuum of nuclear matter with riemannian geometry .",
    "methods developed in cosmology for the description of the spacetime continuum at large scales , may also be used for the understanding of such nuclear phenomena as well as the structural evolution of atomic nuclei .",
    "the comparison of the collective modes of motion of an atomic nucleus with the oscillations of an irrotational fluid @xcite , defines the reference to the continuum .",
    "the fluid consists of nuclear matter @xcite , which is achieved by the extension of the mass number @xmath2 at infinity .",
    "bohr space @xcite is a five dimensional riemannian geometry for the continuum .",
    "shapes of finite atomic nuclei , axially symmetric , triaxial , and close to spherical ( @xmath3-unstable ) , can be represented by specific constraints of bohr space coordinates .",
    "but the initial reference to infinity , which defines the continuum and thus the shape variables , is absent in the bohr geometry . a mass parameter obtained by irrotational flow for the nuclear matter and the quantization of the kinetic energy produce the bohr hamiltonian @xcite , in which the comparison with the nuclear collective modes of motion is implicit .    nuclear collective modes of motion",
    "can also be analyzed in terms of interacting bosons , paired valence nucleons of angular momentum zero ( @xmath4 boson ) and two ( @xmath5 boson ) @xcite , which build the @xmath6 symmetry group .",
    "three different chains of @xmath6 subgroups define the dynamical symmetries of the interacting boson model the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath0 . in its geometrical limit ,",
    "obtained through the coherent states of @xmath6 @xcite , the number of bosons extends to infinity which also defines a continuum .",
    "dynamical symmetries are thus translated into phases of nuclear structure which accommodate spherical , axially symmetric , and @xmath3-unstable shapes , through energy surfaces expressed in bohr coordinates .",
    "the relation between the continuum of bohr geometry and that of the geometrical limit of the ibm has been for many years a matter of investigation .",
    "this is also the case in the study of quantum phase transitions @xcite , where the reference to infinity in the context of the ibm is of primary importance for the manifestation of these phenomena in the evolution of structure of atomic nuclei . their connection with shape transitions in bohr geometry and the possible symmetries which characterize the transition , critical point symmetries , challenge again the relationship between the geometrical limit of the ibm and bohr geometry .",
    "bohr geometry is five dimensional , while the geometrical limit of the ibm @xcite is achieved from a geometrical constraint on 5 + 1 coordinates which correspond to the coherent states of the @xmath6 group .",
    "the geometrical limit of the ibm succeeds to offer an explicit relation between the nuclear collective modes and the shape variables .",
    "an extra dimension in the bohr geometry can introduce the reference to infinity , as well as the emergence of symmetries principally absent from the bohr model .",
    "possible relations of the emergent symmetries with those of the ibm should serve for the explicit comparison of the nuclear collective motions with the oscillations of the nuclear fluid .    in the bohr hamiltonian",
    ", the absence of such an explicit comparison could generate the well known phenomenological deviations of the mass parameter .",
    "apart from recent studies @xcite , they are also reflected in the discrepancy with the experiment @xcite of the relation between the moments of inertia @xmath9 and the intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath10 , @xmath11 , as it is predicted in the bohr model through their dependence with respect to the axial deformation @xmath12 .",
    "the hydrodynamic expression for the @xmath13-dependence of the moments of inertia is certainly inconsistent with the experiment .",
    "they exhibit a rather moderate increase with respect to @xmath12 and are considerably larger than the irrotational prediction @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present letter to propose a geometry able to host the definition of the bohr space at infinity .",
    "success relies on the embedding of bohr space in six dimensions as a five sphere .",
    "a conformal factor compares the five sphere with the initial bohr space , which is revealed as the boundary at infinity .",
    "the symmetry group of the five sphere is the @xmath0 , its relation with the correspondent limit of the ibm is discussed , and contracts to the @xmath1 symmetry @xcite at infinity .",
    "re - formulation of the bohr hamiltonian in six dimensions , on the five sphere and on the projected plane , introduces the phenomenological consequences of the proposed geometry .",
    "they begin from the alteration of the dependence of the moments of inertia with respect to the deformation , or the appearance of a deformation - dependent mass parameter .",
    "forms of the @xmath12-part of the moments of inertia depend on the symmetry region , implying symmetry - dependent rules for their relation with the intrinsic quadrupole moment .",
    "last but not least , the emergent presence of @xmath1 opens new possibilities for its manifestation in atomic nuclei .",
    "bohr space can be defined by the element of length @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "these coordinates span a five dimensional space @xmath20 .",
    "it is defined @xcite by the tensor product of the radial line @xmath21 , which represents the totality of the @xmath12 values , and the unit four sphere @xmath22 , which represents the totality of the values of the angle @xmath3 and the three euler angles @xmath23 .",
    "namely @xmath24 . in",
    "what follows , the notation @xmath25 for the bohr coordinates @xmath26 will be useful , with @xmath27 representing the four angles .",

    "the line element @xmath32 affected by the conformal factor gives a @xmath33 with @xmath34 such forms of line elements exist in cosmological models , like the robertson - walker , for the description of conformally flat spaces .",
    "they are derived by the projection of a hypersphere to the plane , as can be found in a typical textbook in general relativity @xcite . as a formal correspondence with the geometry of rw ,",
    "pick a system of coordinates of five angles @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , and @xmath27 the same as in bohr space .",
    "the totality of the values of the five angles @xmath35 at a common radius @xmath37 , define the five sphere @xmath38 with line element @xmath39 an appropriate transformation between the angle @xmath40 and the radial variable @xmath12 , so as to produce the line element of eq .",

    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , the @xmath38 of radius @xmath51 defines a boundary in six dimensions , represented by the equation @xmath52 stereographic projection from the north pole of the @xmath38 on to the tangent plane is equivalent with the conformal transformation of the bohr line element .",
    "the tangent plane is the @xmath20 , spanned by the quadrupole degree of freedom @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "standard relationships of stereographic projection @xcite give @xmath55 with the tangent plane to be located at @xmath56 .",
    "now , @xmath44 is revealed as the projected radial variable from @xmath38 to the tangent plane @xmath57 a part of the tangent plane is characterized by the @xmath44 variable .",
    "this is the projected plane , defined by ( [ rw ] ) , which is compared with the bohr space through the conformal factor . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the boundary of @xmath38 extends to infinity , where the bohr line element @xmath32 is obtained .",
    "any well defined boundary in six dimensions can be characterized as a bohr hypersurface .",
    "this reflects the possibility of the existence of bohr type hamiltonians in these hypersurfaces .",
    "the original bohr hamiltonian belongs to the boundary at infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "the symmetry group of the totality of transformations of the @xmath38 into itself is the @xmath0 .",
    "let us construct the generators of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath49 and their conjugate momentum generators @xmath59 .",
    "they are obtained as the special case of @xmath60 for the @xmath61 @xcite . with @xmath62 ,",
    "@xmath0 generators are @xmath63 in @xcite the ibm is considered as a six dimensional harmonic oscillator , with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons to be expressed in terms of six variables , and their canonical conjugates , which we write as @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath0 limit reveals a structure like ( [ osix ] ) in a geometry of one radial variable @xmath65 , and five angles @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the embedding of bohr space in six dimensions is characterized by the variables @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and @xmath44 instead of @xmath12 , @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath38 is that of the @xmath0 limit of the ibm , if in @xcite @xmath44 replaces @xmath12 which induces its stereographic projection to the tangent plane .",
    "the number operator @xcite is @xmath71 with @xmath72 the second order casimir of @xmath0 . replacing @xmath12 with @xmath44 in @xcite",
    "@xmath73 the choice of @xmath69 is a constraint in the number operator ( [ number ] ) , its radial part is canceled . for @xmath58",
    ", @xmath74 goes to infinity .",
    "the re - formulation of the bohr hamiltonian on the @xmath38 can be obtained by the laplacian of the line element ( [ sph ] ) , assuming a mass parameter @xmath75 as in the initial bohr hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath76 @xmath77 is the second order casimir operator of the @xmath78 .",

    "again , the two expressions coincide if in @xcite @xmath44 replaces @xmath12 .    the latter hamiltonian ( [ proj ] ) , lives on the projected plane from the @xmath38 .",
    "the conformal factor affects , apart from the whole radial part , only the coefficient of @xmath77 .",
    "now the dependence of the moments of inertia with respect to @xmath12 is @xmath80 .",
    "the same result is obtained in bohr s calculation @xcite @xmath81 using the coordinates @xmath49,@xmath82 , of eq .",
    "( [ stereo ] ) .",
    "@xmath83 is the angular momentum .",
    "the angles @xmath27 were not affected from the embedding and the wigner matrices are not influenced by the projection , as of the invariance of the @xmath84 .",
    "the effects of the projection from the @xmath38 , or of the @xmath0 symmetry , can appear in a deformation - dependent mass parameter in the initial bohr space without the extra dimension .",
    "this is indicated by the last expression ( [ moi ] ) where a mass parameter @xmath85 and the bohr coordinates @xmath53 , produce the same result .",
    "a bohr hamiltonian with this deformation - dependent mass parameter has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the moments of inertia in the present approach implies that their relation with the intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath86 is symmetry - dependent .",
    "the original bohr hamiltonian in @xmath20 gives moments of inertia @xmath87 , while that of ( [ proj ] ) gives @xmath88 .",
    "projection from @xmath38 is an @xmath0 fingerprint , and signifies a new symmetry region than that of the original bohr hamiltonian in @xmath20 . with the usual quadrupole operator of the bohr model @xcite @xmath89 .",
    "the new rule for the relation of the moments of inertia with the intrinsic quadrupole moment is @xmath90 .",
    "however the exact rule needs the consideration of the @xmath12-part of the quadrupole operator in the new symmetry region .",
    "this is beyond the purposes of the present work , it should be done in agreement with the geometrical limit of the ibm .",
    "to which region of the ibm shall the hamiltonian ( [ proj ] ) be located ? it should not be the exact @xmath0 limit , as it does not live on the five sphere but on the projected plane .",
    "on the other hand , the symmetries revealed by the projection of @xmath38 to @xmath20 , which involves a dimensional reduction from six to five dimensions , can be studied with the use of the group contractions .    at the boundary of @xmath38 at infinity , @xmath0 contracts @xcite to the euclidean group in five dimensions @xmath1 .",

    "the set of generators @xmath97 contracts to the set @xmath98 for @xmath58 .",
    "the latter set generates the @xmath1 symmetry group @xcite , which was proposed in @xcite to characterize the critical point for a second order shape - phase transition from spherical to @xmath3-unstable nuclei .",
    "it corresponds to the infinite square well potential for the @xmath12 variable , in the initial bohr hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ proj ] ) for @xmath58 coincides with that of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "now , the geometrical limit of ibm @xcite in its @xmath99 transitional region hosts a point for a second order phase transition .",
    "the presence of @xmath1 for @xmath58 , the @xmath100 invariance during the projection , as well as the argument that the hamiltonian ( [ proj ] ) should not correspond to an exact @xmath0 limit , imply its adaptation to the @xmath99 transitional region of the ibm .",
    "predictions of @xmath1 manifestations in atomic nuclei which lean on the spectrum of the initial bohr hamiltonian , are rather incomplete .",
    "the absence of the conformal factor in the initial bohr hamiltonian reflects the absence of @xmath0 fingerprints .",
    "parameter @xmath31 controls the presence of the conformal factor . in @xcite , @xmath31-values are obtained by their rms fitting to the experimental data for the energy spectrum of a plethora of @xmath3-unstable nuclei .",
    "a close examination of its available values draws attention to the nuclei for which @xmath58 . fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] displays the a - values for the xe and ba isotopes .",
    "parameter @xmath31 is not zero for a single nucleus in the series of xe , or in that of the ba isotopes .",

    "this remark should not be received as a proposal for @xmath1 candidates . in @xcite for @xmath58 the hamiltonian of @xmath1 @xcite is not obtained , davidson term @xmath13 survives which nevertheless has been proposed to characterize the transitional region @xcite .",
    "the present approach implies that the manifestation of @xmath1 in atomic nuclei , needs additional experimental measures than those obtained by the initial bohr hamiltonian .",
    "a geometrical limit of the ibm containing the parameter @xmath31 should illustrate its appearance in nuclear structure .",

    "the re - formulation of the bohr hamiltonian on the projected plane is adapted to the @xmath99 region of the ibm .",
    "its consequences are :      \\(ii ) equivalently , in the projected plane the moments of inertia exhibit a different dependence with respect to the deformation , than in the original bohr model .",
