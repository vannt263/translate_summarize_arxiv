    "the trapped bose gas with attractive interactions is a novel physical system . at high densities",
    "such clouds are mechanically unstable ; however at low densities they can be stabilized by quantum mechanical and entropic effects .",
    "stability and collapse has been observed in clouds of degenerate @xmath0li @xcite and @xmath1rb @xcite .",
    "the collapse of the bose gas shares many features of the gravitational collapse of cold interstellar hydrogen , described by the jeans instability @xcite ; related instabilities occur in supercooled vapors .",
    "theoretical studies of the attractive bose gas , typically numerical , have been limited to zero @xcite or very low temperature @xcite . here",
    "we give a simple analytic description of the region of stability and threshold for collapse valid from zero temperature to well above the bose condensation transition , and thus provide a consistent global picture of the instability . as we see , at finite temperature , the phase diagram of the bose gas includes regions where the non - condensed particles play a significant role in the collapse @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] which shows three regions : normal , bose condensed , and collapsed .",
    "this third region is not readily accessible experimentally ; the system becomes unstable at the boundary ( the solid line in the figure ) . in this figure",
    "the condensation and collapse lines actually meet at a finite angle .",
    "the gross features of the phase diagram can be understood qualitatively with dimensional arguments . at low temperatures",
    "the only stabilizing force is the zero - point motion of the atoms .",
    "this `` quantum pressure '' has a characteristic energy per particle of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is planck s constant , @xmath4 is the volume in which the cloud is confined , and @xmath5 is the mass of an atom .",
    "the attractive interactions which drive the collapse are associated with an energy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the density , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 nm for @xmath0li and @xmath10 nm for @xmath1rb ) is the s - wave scattering length .",
    "comparison of @xmath11 with @xmath12 suggests that for low temperatures the density @xmath7 at collapse should be @xmath13 , independent of temperature . at high temperatures ,",
    "the stabilizing force is thermal pressure , @xmath14 , which is characterized by the thermal energy @xmath15 . here",
    "comparison of @xmath11 with @xmath16 suggests that at high temperatures the density of collapse should be @xmath17 , linear in temperature .",
    "the crossover between the quantum and classical behaviors ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) occurs near @xmath20 .",
    "the collapse , as described here , is a phenomena in which the cloud as a whole participates , not just the condensate .",
    "our basic approach is to identify the collapse with an instability in the lowest energy mode of the system ( the breathing mode in a spherically symmetric cloud ) .",
    "as the system goes from stable to unstable , the frequency of this mode goes from real to complex , passing through zero when the instability sets in .",
    "the density response function , @xmath21 , which measures the response of the cloud to a probe at wave vector @xmath22 and frequency @xmath23 , diverges at the resonant frequencies of the cloud .",
    "therefore , by virtue of the vanishing frequency of the lowest energy mode , the collapse is characterized by @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the wave - vector of the unstable mode , whose wavelength @xmath26 should be of order the size of the system .",
    "equation ( [ res ] ) implicitly determines the line of collapse in the temperature - density plane .",
    "to evaluate the response function analytically , we use a local - density approximation , replacing the response function @xmath21 of the inhomogeneous cloud by that of a gas with uniform density @xmath7 .",
    "the response of the uniform gas is evaluated at the same frequency and wave - vector as for the inhomogeneous system , and @xmath7 is given by the central density of the atomic cloud .",
    "the local - density approximation should be valid for temperatures large enough that the thermal wavelength , @xmath27 , is much smaller than the size of the trap . in all experiments to date , this condition is satisfied , and we treat @xmath28 as a small parameter in our calculation . with this approximation ,",
    "we calculate the line of collapse using the well developed theory of @xmath21 of a uniform gas ( reviewed in @xcite ) .    in the experiments on @xmath0li ,",
    "the atoms are held in a magnetic trap with a harmonic confining potential @xmath29 , with @xmath30@xcite .",
    "this potential gives the cloud a roughly gaussian density profile ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : profile ] ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath31 is typically 50 times the trap energy @xmath32nk , so the parameter @xmath28 , @xmath33 , is small .",
    "the experiments on @xmath1rb use softer traps , @xmath34nk , and colder temperatures @xmath35nk , so that @xmath36 .",
    "the goal of our approach is to provide a framework for investigating the interplay of condensation and collapse .",
    "although our results are not as accurate as can be obtained numerically ( comparing with previous numerical work @xcite , we find that are results are always well within a factor of two of those calculated using more sophisticated models ) , the conceptual and computational advantages of working with a uniform geometry far outway any loss in accuracy . due to their simplicity",
    ", the arguments used here provide an essential tool to choosing which parameter ranges to investigate in future experiments and computations .",
    "the tools introduced to discuss the collapse of an attractive gas can also be used to describe other instabilities in trapped bose gases . in section",
    "[ sec : pairing ] and [ sec : spins ] , we apply these methods to the problem of bcs type pairing between bosons , and towards domain formation in spinor condensates .",
    "to illustrate our approach we first consider the stability of a zero temperature bose condensate .",

    "all long wavelength modes with @xmath40 have imaginary frequencies and are unstable .",
    "a system of finite size @xmath26 only has modes with @xmath41 , and for larger @xmath22 has an excitation spectrum similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bog ] ) . if @xmath42 , the unstable modes are inaccessible and the attractive bose gas is stable .",
    "this information is included in the density response function @xmath21 of the dilute zero - temperature gas @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 the poles of @xmath45 are at the excitation energies , @xmath46 . in particular , @xmath47 diverges when @xmath48 .",
    "we further illustrate our procedure by calculating the stability of an attractive bose gas at temperature much larger than @xmath20 , where thermal pressure is the predominant stabilizing force .",
    "quantum effects are negligible in this limit , and the line of collapse is simply the spinodal line of the classical liquid - gas phase transition @xcite , as characterized by mermin @xcite .",
    "we neglect finite size effects , and look for an instability in the uniform gas at zero wavevector , @xmath50 , corresponding to finding where @xmath51 diverges",
    ". the susceptibility @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the chemical potential ) , is proportional to the compressability of the system , which diverges when the gas becomes unstable .    at high temperature",

    "the above calculation is only valid well above @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath68 , finite size effects start to become important , and a more sophisticated approach is needed .",
    "if one blindly used the above result near @xmath20 one would erroneously find that the instability towards collapse prevents bose condensation from occurring .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided by working with the finite wave - vector response @xmath47 , to which we now turn .",
    "the approximation we shall use for @xmath45 is to treat the response of the gas in the rpa , with the simplifying assumption that the bare response of the condensed and non - condensed particles is taken to be the response of a non - interacting system .",
    "this approach , employed by szpfalusy and kondor @xcite in studying the critical behavior of collective modes of a bose gas , and later modified by minguzzi and tosi @xcite to include exchange , is simple to evaluate analytically , and is valid both above and below @xmath20 .",

    "we use the following relations to plot the instability on the @xmath87 phase diagram , @xmath88    equations  ( [ eq : belowt ] ) and ( [ eq : belowt2 ] ) indicate that below @xmath20 the noncondensate response @xmath71 scales as @xmath89 , while the condensate response @xmath70 scales as @xmath90 . for realistic parameters , @xmath26 is the largest length in the problem , so that the condensate dominates the instability except when @xmath73 is much smaller than @xmath7 .",

    "the most significant difference is that the line of collapse follows the condensation line ( on the scale of the figure they appear to coincide over a significant temperature range ) .",
