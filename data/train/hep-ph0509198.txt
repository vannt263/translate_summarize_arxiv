    "the standard model of elementary particles has been an extraordinary breakthrough in our description of the physical world .",
    "it agrees with experiment and observation disconcertingly well and surely provides the foundation for all further progress in our field .",
    "it does however present us with a puzzle .",
    "indeed the action density includes , in general , a term @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the qcd field strengths , @xmath5 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath6 is a parameter .",
    "the dots represent all the other terms in the action density , i.e. the terms that lead to the numerous successes of the standard model .",
    "( [ ggdual ] ) perversely shows the one term that is nt a success . using the statement of the chiral anomaly @xcite",
    ", one can show three things about that term .",
    "first , that qcd physics depends on the value of the parameter @xmath6 because in the absence of such dependence qcd would have a @xmath7 symmetry in the chiral limit , and we know qcd has no such @xmath7 symmetry @xcite .",
    "second , that @xmath6 is cyclic , that is to say that physics at @xmath6 is indistinguishable from physics at @xmath8 .",
    "third , that an overall phase in the quark mass matrix @xmath9 can be removed by a redefinition of the quark fields only if , at the same time , @xmath6 is shifted to @xmath10 .",
    "the combination of standard model parameters @xmath11 is independent of quark field redefinitions .",
    "physics therefore depends on @xmath6 solely through @xmath12 .    since physics depends on @xmath12 , the value of @xmath12",
    "is determined by experiment . the term shown in eq .",
    "( [ ggdual ] ) violates p and cp .",
    "this source of p and cp violation is incompatible with the experimental upper bound on the neutron electic dipole moment @xcite unless @xmath13 .",
    "the puzzle aforementioned is why the value of @xmath12 is so small .",
    "it is usually referred to as the  strong cp problem \" .",
    "if there were only strong interactions , a zero value of @xmath12 could simply be a consequence of p and cp conservation .",
    "that would not be much of a puzzle .",
    "but there are also weak interactions and they , and therefore the standard model as a whole , violate p and cp .",
    "so these symmetries can not be invoked to set @xmath14 .",
    "more pointedly , p and cp violation are introduced in the standard model by letting the elements of the quark mass matrix @xmath9 be arbitrary complex numbers @xcite . in that case , one expects @xmath15 , and hence @xmath12 , to be a random angle .    the puzzle is removed if the action density is instead @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a new scalar field , and the dots represent the other terms of the standard model .",
    "@xmath18 is a constant with dimension of energy .",
    "the @xmath19 interaction in eq .",
    "( [ ax ] ) is not renormalizable .",
    "however , there is a recipe for constructing renormalizable theories whose low energy effective action density is of the form of eq .",
    "( [ ax ] ) .",
    "the recipe is as follows : construct the theory in such a way that it has a @xmath20 symmetry which ( 1 ) is a global symmetry of the classical action density , ( 2 ) is broken by the color anomaly , and ( 3 ) is spontaneously broken .",
    "such a symmetry is called peccei - quinn symmetry after its inventors @xcite . weinberg and",
    "wilczek @xcite pointed out that a theory with a @xmath21 symmetry has a light pseudo - scalar particle , called the axion .",
    "the axion field is @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is of order the expectation value that breaks @xmath21 , and is called the  axion decay constant \" .    in the theory defined by eq .",
    "( [ ax ] ) , @xmath22 depends on the expectation value of @xmath17 .",
    "that expectation value minimizes the effective potential .",
    "the strong cp problem is then solved because the minimum of the qcd effective potential @xmath23 occurs at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the weak interactions induce a small value for @xmath12 , of order @xmath24 @xcite , but this is consistent with experiment .",
    "the notion of peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry may seem contrived .",
    "why should there be a @xmath20 symmetry which is broken at the quantum level but which is exact at the classical level ?",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the reasons for pq symmetry may be deeper than we know at present .",
    "string theory contains many examples of symmetries which are exact classically but which are broken by anomalies , including pq symmetry . also , within field theory , there are examples of theories with _ automatic _ pq symmetry , i.e. where pq symmetry is a consequence of just the particle content of the theory without adjustment of parameters to special values .",
    "the first axion models had @xmath18 of order the weak interaction scale and it was thought that this was an unavoidable property of axion models . however , our conference chairman j.e .",
    "kim and others pointed out @xcite that the value of @xmath18 is really arbitrary , that it is possible to construct axion models with any value of @xmath18 .",
    "kim also pointed out @xcite that a value of @xmath18 far from any previously known scale need not lead to a hierarchy problem because pq symmetry can be broken by the condensates of a new technicolor - like interaction .",
    "the properties of the axion can be derived using the methods of current algebra @xcite .",
    "the axion mass is given in terms of @xmath18 by @xmath25 all the axion couplings are inversely proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the axion coupling to two photons is : @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath29 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath30 is a model - dependent coefficient of order one .",
    "@xmath31 in the dfsz model @xcite whereas @xmath32 in the ksvz model @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the axion to a spin 1/2 fermion @xmath33 has the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a model - dependent coefficient of order one . in the ksvz model",
    "the coupling to electrons is zero at tree level .",
    "models with this property are called hadronic.    , or equivalently axion decay constant @xmath18 , which have been ruled out by accelerator searches , the evolution of red giants , the supernova sn1987a , and finally the axion cosmological energy density . ]",
    "the axion has been searched for in many places but not found @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] summarizes the constraints .",
    "axion masses larger than about 50 kev are ruled out by particle physics experiments ( beam dumps and rare decays ) and nuclear physics experiments .",
    "the next range of axion masses , in decreasing order , is ruled out by stellar evolution arguments .",
    "the longevity of red giants rules out 200 kev @xmath36 0.5 ev @xcite in the case of hadronic axions , and 200 kev @xmath37 ev @xcite in the case of axions with a large coupling to electrons [ @xmath38 in eq .",
    "the duration of the neutrino pulse from supernova 1987a rules out 2 ev @xmath39 ev @xcite . finally , there is a lower limit , @xmath40 ev , from cosmology which will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "this leaves open an  axion window \" : @xmath41 ev .",
    "note however that the lower edge of this window ( @xmath2 ev ) is much softer than its upper edge .",
    "the implications of the existence of an axion for the history of the early universe may be briefly described as follows . at a temperature of order @xmath18",
    ", a phase transition occurs in which the @xmath42 symmetry becomes spontaneously broken .",
    "this is called the pq phase transition . at these temperatures , the non - perturbative qcd effects which produce the effective potential @xmath43 are negligible @xcite",
    ", the axion is massless and all values of @xmath44 are equally likely .",
    "axion strings appear as topological defects .",
    "one must distinguish two scenarios , depending on wether inflation occurs with reheat temperature lower ( case 1 ) or higher ( case 2 ) than the pq transition temperature . in case 1",
    "the axion field gets homogenized by inflation and the axion strings are blown away .",
    "when the temperature approaches the qcd scale , the potential @xmath43 turns on and the axion acquires mass .",
    "there is a critical time , defined by @xmath45 , when the axion field starts to oscillate in response to the turn - on of the axion mass .",
    "the corresponding temperature @xmath46 gev @xcite . the initial amplitude of this oscillation is how far from zero the axion field lies when the axion mass turns on .",
    "the axion field oscillations do not dissipate into other forms of energy and hence contribute to the cosmological energy density today @xcite .",
    "this contribution is called of ` vacuum realignment ' .",
    "it is further described below .",
    "note that the vacuum realignment contribution may be accidentally suppressed in case 1 because the homogenized axion field happens to lie close to zero .    in case 2",
    "the axion strings radiate axions @xcite from the time of the pq transition till @xmath47 when the axion mass turns on . at @xmath47",
    "each string becomes the boundary of @xmath48 domain walls .",
    "if @xmath49 , the network of walls bounded by strings is unstable @xcite and decays away . if @xmath50 there is a domain wall problem @xcite because axion domain walls end up dominating the energy density , resulting in a universe very different from the one observed today",
    "there is a way to avoid this problem by introducing an interaction which slightly lowers one of the @xmath48 vacua with respect to the others . in that case ,",
    "the lowest vacuum takes over after some time and the domain walls disappear .",
    "there is little room in parameter space for that to happen and we will not consider this possibility further here . a detailed discussion is given in ref .",
    "henceforth , we assume @xmath49 .    in case 2",
    "there are three contributions to the axion cosmological energy density .",
    "one contribution @xcite is from axions that were radiated by axion strings before @xmath47 .",
    "a second contribution is from axions that were produced in the decay of walls bounded by strings after @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "a third contribution is from vacuum realignment @xcite .",
    "let me briefly indicate how the vacuum alignment contribution is evaluated . before time @xmath47",
    ", the axion field did not oscillate even once .",
    "soon after @xmath47 , the axion mass is assumed to change sufficiently slowly that the total number of axions in the oscillations of the axion field is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "the number density of axions at time @xmath47 is @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ nat1 ] ) , we used the fact that the axion field @xmath17 is approximately homogeneous on the horizon scale @xmath47 .",
    "wiggles in @xmath17 which entered the horizon long before @xmath47 have been red - shifted away @xcite .",
    "we also used the fact that the initial departure of @xmath17 from the nearest minimum is of order @xmath18 .",
    "the axions of eq .",
    "( [ nat1 ] ) are decoupled and non - relativistic .",
    "assuming that the ratio of the axion number density to the entropy density is constant from time @xmath47 till today , one finds @xcite @xmath52 for the ratio of the axion energy density to the critical density for closing the universe .",
    "@xmath53 is the present hubble rate in units of 100 km / s.mpc .",
    "the requirement that axions do not overclose the universe implies the constraint @xmath54   ev .    the contribution from axion string decay has been debated over the years .",
    "the main issue is the energy spectrum of axions radiated by axion strings .",
    "battye and shellard @xcite have carried out computer simulations of bent strings ( i.e. of wiggles on otherwise straight strings ) and have concluded that the contribution from string decay is approximately ten times larger than that from vacuum realignment , implying a bound on the axion mass approximately ten times more severe , say @xmath55 ev instead of @xmath54 ev .",
    "my collaborators and i have done simulations of bent strings @xcite , of circular string loops @xcite and non - circular string loops @xcite . we conclude that the string decay contribution is of the same order of magnitude than that from vacuum realignment .",
    "yamaguchi , kawasaki and yokoyama @xcite have done computer simulations of a network of strings in anexpanding universe , and concluded that the contribution from string decay is approximately three times that of vacuum realignment . the contribution from wall decay has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "it is probably subdominant compared to the vacuum realignment and string decay constributions .",
    "it should be emphasized that there are many sources of uncertainty in the cosmological axion energy density aside from the uncertainty about the contribution from string decay .",
    "the axion energy density may be diluted by the entropy release from heavy particles which decouple before the qcd epoch but decay afterwards @xcite , or by the entropy release associated with a first order qcd phase transition .",
    "on the other hand , if the qcd phase transition is first order @xcite , an abrupt change of the axion mass at the transition may increase @xmath56 .",
    "if inflation occurs with reheat temperature less than @xmath57 , there may be an accidental suppression of @xmath56 because the homogenized axion field happens to lie close to a @xmath58 conserving minimum . because the rhs of eq .",
    "( 7 ) is multiplied in this case by a factor of order the square of the initial vacuum misalignment angle @xmath59 which is randomly chosen between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the probability that @xmath56 is suppressed by a factor @xmath62 is of order @xmath63 .",
    "this rule can not be extended to arbitrarily small @xmath62 however because quantum mechanical fluctuations in the axion field during the epoch of inflation do not allow the suppression to be perfect @xcite .",
    "recently , kaplan and zurek proposed a model @xcite in which the axion decay constant @xmath18 is time - dependent , the value @xmath64 during the qcd phase - transition being much smaller than the value @xmath18 today .",
    "this yields a suppression of the axion cosmological energy density by a factor @xmath65 compared to the usual case [ replace @xmath18 by @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ nat1 ] ) ] .",
    "the axions produced when the axion mass turns on during the qcd phase transition are cold dark matter ( cdm ) because they are non - relativistic from the moment of their first appearance at 1  gev temperature .",
    "studies of large scale structure formation support the view that the dominant fraction of dark matter is cdm .",
    "any form of cdm necessarily contributes to galactic halos by falling into the gravitational wells of galaxies .",
    "hence , there is excellent motivation to look for axions as constituent particles of our galactic halo .",
    "finally , let s mention that there is a particular kind of clumpiness @xcite which affects axion dark matter if there is no inflation after the peccei - quinn phase transition .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dark matter axions are inhomogeneous with @xmath66 over the horizon scale at temperature @xmath67 1 gev , when they are produced at the start of the qcd phase - transition , combined with the fact that their velocities are so small that they do not erase these inhomogeneities by free - streaming before the time @xmath68 of equality between the matter and radiation energy densities when matter perturbations can start to grow .",
    "these particular inhomogeneities in the axion dark matter are in the non - linear regime immediately after time @xmath68 and thus form clumps , called ` axion mini - clusters ' @xcite .",
    "they have mass @xmath69 and size @xmath70 cm .",
    "an electromagnetic cavity permeated by a strong static magnetic field can be used to detect galactic halo axions @xcite .",
    "the relevant coupling is given in eq .",
    "( [ aeb ] ) .",
    "galactic halo axions have velocities @xmath71 of order @xmath72 and hence their energies @xmath73 have a spread of order @xmath2 above the axion mass . when the frequency @xmath74 of a cavity mode equals @xmath0 , galactic halo axions convert resonantly into quanta of excitation ( photons ) of that cavity mode . the power from axion @xmath75 photon conversion on resonance",

    "the cavity can be tuned by moving a dielectric rod or metal post inside it .    for a cylindrical cavity and a homogeneous longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath87 for the lowest tm mode .",
    "the form factors of the other modes are much smaller .",
    "the resonant frequency of the lowest tm mode of a cylindrical cavity is @xmath33=115 mhz @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the radius of the cavity .",

    "it is assumed that the distribution of cdm particles in galactic halos is isothermal",
    ". however , there are excellent reasons to believe that a large fraction of the local density of cold dark matter particles is in discrete flows with definite velocities @xcite . indeed ,",
    "because cdm has very low primordial velocity dispersion and negligible interactions other than gravity , the cdm particles lie on a 3-dim .",
    "hypersurface in 6-dim .",
    "phase - space .",
    "this implies that the velocity spectrum of cdm particles at any physical location is discrete , i.e. , it is the sum of distinct flows each with its own density and velocity .",
    "we searched for the peaks in the spectrum of microwave photons from axion to photon conversion that such discrete flows would cause in the admx detector .",

    "our limit on the density of discrete flows is approximately a factor three more severe than our limit on the total local axion dark matter density .",

    "when both phases of the upgrade are completed , the admx detector will have sufficient sensitivity to detect dfsz axions at even a fraction of the local halo density .",
    "the conversion of axions to photons in a magnetic field can also be used to look for solar axions @xcite .",
    "the flux of solar axions on earth is @xmath97 from the primakoff conversion of thermal photons in the sun @xcite .",
    "the actual flux may be larger because other processes , such as compton - like scattering , contribute if the axion has an appreciable coupling to the electron . at any rate the flux is huge compared to what can be produced by man - made processes on earth and it is cost free .",
    "solar axions have a broad spectrum of energies of order the temperature in the solar core , from one to a few kev .    since the magnetic field is homogeneous on the length scale set by the axion de broglie wavelength , the final photon is colinear with the initial axion .",
    "the photon and axion also have the same energy assuming the magnetic field is time - independent .",
    "the @xmath98 conversion probability is @xcite @xmath99 if @xmath100 is the magnetic field transverse to the direction of the colinear axion and photon , @xmath101 is the coordinate along this direction , @xmath102 is the depth over which the magnetic field extends and @xmath103 is the form factor @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the momentum transfer .",
    "if the magnetic field is homogeneous ( @xmath106 ) , then @xmath107 for @xmath108 , the conversion probability goes as @xmath109 because the axion and photons oscillate into each other back and forth .",
