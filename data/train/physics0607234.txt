    "intense effort has been devoted to the study of the new properties of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the field was further broadened by the achievement of quantum degeneracy in fermi gases of @xmath9k @xcite and @xmath10li @xcite , and ultracold fermionic quantum matter has proved to exhibit a new range of novel properties .",
    "bose - einstein condensation and fermi degeneracy in dilute gases typically require temperatures between 1 nk and 1 @xmath11k .",
    "however , new quantum properties start to appear at temperatures around 1 mk , where de broglie wavelengths become large compared to atomic and molecular dimensions . under these circumstances",
    ", collisions are fully quantum - mechanical and are primarily sensitive to long - range interactions .",
    "the region below 1 mk is generally referred to as the _ ultracold _ regime .    over the last few years",
    ", the focus of research in quantum matter has shifted to the _ control _ of ultracold quantum systems .",
    "a particularly important development has been the ability to form and manipulate _",
    "molecules _ in ultracold atomic gases .",
    "molecules have a much richer energy level structure than atoms , and offer many new possibilities for quantum control .",
    "perhaps most importantly , _",
    "dipolar _ molecules interact with one another much more strongly and at longer range than atoms .",
    "dipolar quantum gases are predicted to exhibit more new features @xcite and have possible applications in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "cold molecules also have applications in high - precision measurement , and high - resolution spectroscopy on cold molecules may allow the measurement of fundamental physical properties such as the electric dipole moment of the electron @xcite , the energy differences between enantiomers ( which result from parity violation ) @xcite and the time - dependence of the fine - structure constant @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches to producing molecular quantum gases : _ direct _ approaches , in which pre - existing molecules are cooled from room temperature , and _ indirect _ approaches , in which molecules are formed from precooled atoms .",
    "the direct approaches have been reviewed previously @xcite and there are also several reviews that focus on the applications of scattering theory to directly cooled molecules @xcite . the purpose of this article is to review molecule formation in ultracold quantum gases by _ indirect _ methods .",
    "the physics of cooling and trapping atoms @xcite and of the production and properties of bose - einstein condensates @xcite has been reviewed many times .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to a brief discussion , focussing on aspects of the subject that are essential to understanding the present review but may be unfamiliar to readers with a background in physical chemistry rather than atomic physics .",
    "all fundamental particles are either bosons or fermions .",
    "bosons have integer spin quantum numbers , while fermions have odd half - integer spin quantum numbers .",
    "the fundamental difference is encompassed by the _ pauli principle _ , which states that the total wavefunction for a system must be symmetric with respect to exchange of any pair of identical bosons , but antisymmetric with respect to exchange of a pair of identical fermions .",
    "the most important consequence of the pauli principle is the _ pauli exclusion principle _ , which states that no two fermions in the same spin state can occupy the same spatial state .    under circumstances where",
    "individual electrons can not be exchanged , atoms and molecules are _",
    "composite _ bosons or fermions . any atom or molecule with an even number of nucleons and electrons",
    "is a composite boson and any with an odd number is a composite fermion . for the alkali metals , with an odd number of electrons , isotopes with bosonic nuclei ( @xmath10li , @xmath9k ) are composite _ fermions _ and isotopes with fermionic nuclei ( @xmath1li , @xmath2na , @xmath4k , etc . )",

    "[ rb85-zeeman ] ( the breit - rabi diagram ) .",
    "an atom for which the ground state has the lowest value of @xmath17 is said to have _ regular _ hyperfine structure , and one in which the order is reversed is said to have _ inverted _ hyperfine structure .",
    "the only alkali metal atom important to the present review that has inverted hyperfine structure is @xmath9k .",

    "the nearly conserved quantities are the individual projections @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this occurs at quite high field for @xmath3rb but at much smaller fields for atoms with smaller hyperfine splittings such as @xmath10li .",

    "their energy level structure is thus considerably more complex than for atoms .",
    "nevertheless , it remains true that the zero - field levels are characterised by a total angular momentum @xmath17 , and that in a field these are split into components with projection quantum number @xmath16 .",
    "ultracold atoms and molecules would condense if they came into contact with the walls of a vessel .",

    "a magnetic trap has a typical depth of around 1 mk .    a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) @xcite uses a combination of magnetic fields and doppler cooling @xcite to trap atoms at considerably higher densities than is possible with magnetic fields alone .",
    "a mot can also cool atoms below the theoretical limit of doppler cooling by a mechanism known as sisyphus cooling @xcite . for example , in early work on @xmath2na , lett _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed a temperature of 40 @xmath11k , compared to the 240 @xmath11k expected .",
    "even this is not by itself sufficient to achieve bose - einstein condensation , and a final stage of cooling , often by evaporative cooling @xcite , is needed to achieve sub-@xmath11k temperatures .",
    "ultracold atoms can also be confined in an optical dipole trap @xcite .",
    "optical dipole traps have the advantage that all magnetic sublevels can be trapped simultaneously .",
    "they rely on the fact that the energy of an atom in an electric field oscillating at frequency @xmath24 is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the electric field strength .",
    "the frequency - dependent polarizability @xmath27 is positive at low frequencies but is enhanced ( and changes sign ) near absorption frequencies .",
    "an optical dipole trap operates by creating an electric field _",
    "maximum _ in a region of strong laser radiation , and can be either _ near - resonant _ , taking advantage of the enhancement in @xmath27 near an absorption , or _",
    "far off - resonance_. a far off - resonance trap ( fort ) @xcite causes less heating but is much shallower than a near - resonant trap ( sometimes as little as 10 @xmath11k ) .",
    "an optical dipole trap in which the laser frequency is so low that the polarizability is close to its static value is referred to as a quasi - electrostatic trap ( quest ) @xcite .",
    "an optical dipole trap can confine molecules as well as atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition , molecules with magnetic dipole moments can be trapped magnetically @xcite .",
    "molecules with electric dipole moments can be trapped by an analogous _ electrostatic _ approach @xcite .",
    "most traps produce a trapping potential that is nearly harmonic near the minimum . because of this ,",
    "the `` translational '' energy spectrum of trapped atoms is not actually continuous , as is the case for free particles .",
    "instead , it is discretised by the confinement in the trap : the energy level spacings @xmath28 are typically 10 to 1000 hz , corresponding to 0.5 to 50 nk .",
    "bosons and fermions follow quite different quantum statistics : bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics respectively . in a bose - einstein condensate ,",
    "nearly all the atoms are in the lowest level in the trap ( though there are always uncondensed atoms coexisting with the condensate ) . in a harmonic trap",
    ", condensation occurs at a critical temperature @xmath29 given approximately by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of atoms @xcite . in a fermi - degenerate gas , by contrast , each level can accommodate only one atom in each spin state ( @xmath32 ) , so that the system is characterised by full occupation of trap levels up to the fermi level , forming a `` fermi sea '' .",
    "the fermi temperature @xmath33 is again proportional to the level spacing , @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "many of the properties of a bose - einstein condensate depend only on the scattering length and are unaffected by short - range properties of the wavefunction such as the number of nodes .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath45 of a uniform bose gas is proportional to @xmath44 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number density , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the atomic mass @xcite .",
    "a positive scattering length thus corresponds to an interaction that is overall repulsive , while a negative scattering length corresponds to an interaction that is overall attractive .",
    "a large bose - einstein condensate can usually exist only for positive scattering lengths ; for negative scattering lengths there is a limit to the size of condensate that can be formed @xcite .",
    "the scattering length is closely related to the energy of the highest bound state of the atom - atom pair , @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath50 is small and negative ( a bound state just below threshold ) , the scattering length is large and positive and is related to the bound - state energy approximately by @xmath51 the scattering length increases to infinity as @xmath50 approaches zero and reappears at large negative values when @xmath52 .",
    "the scattering length depends on the interaction potential and on the reduced mass .",
