    "some of the most remarkable predictions of quantum field theory arise from zero point fluctuations of quantum states .",
    "one of the best known examples of this is the unruh effect @xcite , in which an accelerating detector measures the zero point fluctuations of the inertial ( minkowski ) vacuum state and finds they have a thermal spectrum .",
    "another is the casimir effect @xcite , in which the walls ( or boundaries ) of a box experience a net force due to the difference between the zero point fluctuations of the states inside the box and out .",
    "it seems reasonable , then , to expect accelerating boundaries to produce interesting effects , and indeed they do .",
    "following studies of the casimir effect between moving mirrors in 1 + 1 dimensions by moore @xcite , dewitt pointed out that the single moving mirror problem would be interesting and could be solved exactly in ( 1 + 1)d@xcite .",
    "fulling @xcite and dewitt@xcite have shown that a _",
    "uniformly _ accelerating mirror will indeed alter the quantum state in the vicinity of the mirror .",
    "however , a far more interesting result was obtained by davies and fulling@xcite for a mirror experiencing _ non - uniform _ acceleration in ( 1 + 1)d .",
    "such a mirror actually emits fluxes of quantum radiation , as though the mirror were knocking zero point quanta out of the vacuum and off to infinity .",
    "more precisely , they found that a mirror with 2-velocity @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and acceleration @xmath2 emits a flux @xmath3 in the direction of a unit spatial vector @xmath4 orthogonal to @xmath5 .",
    "this holds for either choice ( `` left '' or `` right '' ) of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , a mirror whose acceleration is increasing ( algebraically ) toward the right will emit a stream of negative energy to the right and a numerically equal positive stream to the left .",
    "the implications of this result are intriguing .",
    "davies@xcite and ford@xcite first raised the possibility that the negative - energy flux from a moving mirror could be used to cool a hot body and thus violate the second law of thermodynamics in a quantum context , and this paradox was further discussed by deutsch , ottewill and sciama@xcite .",
    "limitations on the extent of such violations in flat spacetime ( `` quantum interest '' ) have been formulated by ford and roman@xcite and others ( @xcite , @xcite , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "more recently , anderson@xcite has used this result in the context of the geroch gedankenexperiment@xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "a box with mirrored walls is filled with radiation and lowered adiabatically toward a black hole .",
    "unruh and wald@xcite have shown that such a box is subject to a buoyancy force and will eventually reach a floating point above the black hole .",
    "anderson has examined this further and shown that the ground state inside the box is the boulware state , whose energy ( which becomes increasingly negative as the box descends ) is fed by davies - fulling fluxes from the reflecting walls .",
    "this accounts for the buoyancy felt by the box .",
    "the volume of literature on moving mirrors is impressive , but it bears noting that all the results mentioned above are obtained in 1 + 1 dimensions . indeed , if one includes the result for moving mirrors in curved space - times obtained by ottewill and takagi@xcite with those reviewed above , the ( 1 + 1)d theory of moving mirrors can be considered essentially complete .",
    "this is due largely to the conformal properties of quantum field equations in ( 1 + 1)d , which allow boundaries , and even space - time itself , to be flattened , thereby enabling one to obtain results for complicated geometries from those for much simpler geometries .",
    "this is not the case in 3 + 1 dimensions , where only partial results are available .",
    "the case of constant acceleration has been solved for both plane@xcite and spherical@xcite mirror geometries .",
    "ford and vilenkin@xcite have extended the plane mirror result to include non - constant acceleration for the case when the acceleration and its derivatives are small .",
    "more recently , hadasz _",
    "et al._@xcite have considered arbitrary ( radial ) motion of a spherical mirror , but have restricted their attention to the `` s - wave approximation '' where only spherically symmetric modes are considered . because of this restriction , their result can be related to the 1 + 1 dimensional results of davies and fulling@xcite .",
    "consideration of quasi - stationary processes ( e.g. slow descent of a mirror in a strong gravitational field ) requires knowledge of the flux emitted by a mirror whose acceleration is changing slowly , though it may be large . our objective in this paper is to derive an interesting and relatively simple result of this type in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the central tool is the use of a green s function perturbation technique .",
    "evaluating the perturbation is much more manageable if the green s functions for the unperturbed problem are available in closed form .",
    "this is actually the case for a uniformly accelerated spherical mirror , as shown by frolov and serebriany@xcite .",
    "the mirror s history is then a three - dimensional pseudo - sphere of radius @xmath7 , say , and the unperturbed problem is just the minkowski - signature analogue of finding the four - dimensional electrostatic potential of a point charge in the presence of an earthed conducting 3-sphere of radius @xmath7 .",
    "this is easily solved by the method of images .",
    "our objective in this paper is to solve the perturbed frolov - serebriany problem , _",
    "i.e. _ to examine the effect of small spherically symmetric non - uniformities in the acceleration of a spherical mirror .",
    "it is well to stress at the outset that the solution for a plane mirror can not be derived from ours by a straightforward limiting process .",
    "the single parameter @xmath7 , whose reciprocal gives the unperturbed acceleration , also gives the minimum radius attained by the mirror as seen from its center .",
    "thus , the plane limit @xmath8 is inseparable from small acceleration .",
    "( there are reasons to expect the planar case to be considerably more complicated .",
    "formally , the wightman green s function is now an infinite sum of mcdonald ( bessel ) functions .",
    "geometrically , any light ray reflected non - orthogonally of a uniformly accelerated plane mirror will re - encounter the mirror an infinite number of times ; in the spherical case there is just one encounter . )    also , we concern ourselves only with calculating the outward flux , which we expect to be the most interesting stress - energy component .",
    "in fact , it turns out to be somewhat more interesting than one might expect .",
    "we find that it has a remarkable property ; although it could , in principle , depend on the entire retarded history of the mirror , to first order in the mirror perturbation it depends only the behavior of the mirror at the most recent retarded time , _",
    "i.e. _ it is local .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : uniacc ] we review the frolov - serebriany result for a mirror expanding with uniform acceleration . in section [ sec : perturb ] we present our green s function perturbation scheme , and in section [ sec : eval ] we use it to evaluate the corrections to the frolov - serebriany green s function , with some of the more cumbersome details relegated to appendix [ sec : appa ]",
    ". section [ sec : flux ] is concerned with calculating the quantum flux from these perturbations , with details again left to appendices ( [ sec : appb ] and [ sec : appc ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we offer some concluding remarks .",
    "in the case where the mirror s acceleration is uniform , the green s functions for the massless fields can be obtained in simple closed form by the method of images , as noted by frolov and serebriany@xcite . in this section",
    "we shall briefly review these results .",
    "consider first the static potential due to a point charge @xmath9 in euclidean 4-space at a distance @xmath10 from the center of an earthed conducting 3-sphere of radius @xmath7 .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition can be reproduced by introducing a co - radial image charge @xmath11 at radius @xmath12 .    in the lorentzian analogue of this problem , we are concerned with green s functions for the wave equation @xmath13 in minkowski space - time , with dirichlet boundary conditions on the pseudo - sphere ( _ i.e. _ the time - like hyperboloid of one sheet ) @xmath14 , where now @xmath15 in a self - evident notation .    the pseudo - sphere @xmath14 represents the history of a spherical mirror of radius @xmath7 ( constant as measured in its instantaneous rest frame ) , whose center is fixed at the spatial origin @xmath16 and which moves with uniform acceleration @xmath17 .",
    "the image construction gives for the retarded green s function @xmath18 , satisfying @xmath19 the expression @xmath20-\\left (        \\frac{b}{r'}\\right)^2\\delta[(xx'')^2]\\right\\}. \\label{eq : gretconst}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the unit step ( heaviside ) function , @xmath22 is the dirac distribution , @xmath23 is the squared minkowski interval @xmath24 and the image source is located at @xmath25    similarly , the wightman function @xmath26 for a massless scalar field takes the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding green s functions for a spherical mirror whose acceleration is slightly non - uniform can be derived from the preceding results by superposing the effect of a small perturbation on the history of the mirror , _",
    "i.e. _ , the time - like 3-space @xmath29 on which dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed .    consider generally the problem of solving @xmath30 suppose that @xmath29 is a small perturbation of a simpler time - like 3-space @xmath31 , obtained by displacing @xmath31 a distance @xmath32 along its outward normal @xmath33 , and that we know the solution @xmath34 of the problem @xmath35 with the same initial boundary conditions .",
    "then ( [ eq : bvp ] ) can be reformulated as a problem with boundary conditions specified on the unperturbed boundary @xmath31 : @xmath36    the causal solution for the perturbation @xmath37 follows from green s identity : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the retarded green s function for the unperturbed boundary value problem ( [ eq : unpertbvp ] ) and @xmath40 is in @xmath31 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fieldpert ] ) defines a linear operation applied to @xmath34 , which we shall write for brevity as @xmath41    to obtain the effect of the perturbation on the wightman function ( [ eq : wdef ] ) , we note that it can be written as a mode sum @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a complete set of initially positive frequency solutions of ( [ eq : bvp ] ) and the bar denotes complex conjugation . applying ( [ eq : pertop ] ) to each mode separately and summing the results yields @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the unperturbed wightman function given by ( [ eq : wconst ] ) .",
    "evaluation of the expression ( [ eq : modepert ] ) for @xmath46 in the case where the mirror s acceleration departs slightly from uniformity is somewhat lengthy but straightforward . here",
    ", we outline the results of this calculation reserving the technical details for appendix [ sec : appa ] .",
    "it will be assumed that the mirror remains spherical as viewed by an observer at its center @xmath16 .",
    "then its history is @xmath47 in terms of this observer s time @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is arbitrary but small .",
    "the corresponding advanced and retarded times are written @xmath50    the radial energy flux measured by a stationary observer outside the mirror is @xmath51 each of these terms can be dealt with by a similar procedure .",
    "let us consider @xmath52 ; it is evident from ( [ eq : wdef ] ) that its expectation value at an event @xmath53 outside the mirror is @xmath54_{p_2=p_1 } \\label{eq : fluxdef}\\ ] ] for a minimally coupled massless scalar field , and a similar but more complicated expression for conformal coupling ( see ( [ eq : quantsetconf ] ) below ) .",
    "note that regularization and symmetrization are not needed to evaluate this component of the stress - energy .",
    "we can now present the results for @xmath46 .",
    "the spherical symmetry of ( [ eq : boundpert ] ) allows us to take both @xmath53 and @xmath55 in the @xmath56 plane ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "calculation shows ( see appendix [ sec : appa ] ) that the first term of ( [ eq : modepert ] ) contributes @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are defined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( with coordinates @xmath63 ) is the event nearest to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) at which the past light - cone of @xmath64 intersects the ( unperturbed ) mirror ( see fig .",
    "the contribution of the second term in ( [ eq : modepert ] ) is obtained by interchanging @xmath53 and @xmath55 in ( [ eq : wterm1 ] ) . because @xmath59 is an odd function of @xmath66 ( @xmath60 is even ) , the term involving the integral changes sign .",
    "thus , the sum of the two contributions , @xmath67 depends only on the mirror s history between the retarded times @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "particle and anti - particle modes interfere destructively in the case of a spherical mirror to eliminate the effects of the past history and produce ( when we take the coincidence limit @xmath70 ) a purely local expression for the stress - energy .    to perform the partial derivatives @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the expression ( [ eq : fluxdef ] ) for  @xmath52 , we require mutual independence of the @xmath73-coordinates of the events @xmath53 and @xmath55 . but these are the only coordinates which need be independent .",
    "to evaluate @xmath52 , it suffices to consider @xmath74 in a partial pre - coincidence limit @xmath75 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "these remarks in principle apply , _ mutatis mutandis _ , also to the evaluation of  @xmath76 , but there is a complication . in the pre - coincidence limit @xmath77 ,",
    "the points @xmath78 and @xmath79 tend to coincidence with each other and with the point on the mirror having coordinate @xmath60 , so that the integrand in ( [ eq : deltaw ] ) becomes infinite while the interval of integration shrinks to zero .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath76 is discussed further in appendix [ sec : appc ] . here , we merely note that @xmath76 makes no radiative contribution ( proportional to @xmath80 ) to the flux ( [ eq : fluxdef ] ) .",
    "this follows at once from the identity @xmath81 which is a consequence of the conservation of @xmath82 and the vanishing of the trace @xmath83 for a conformal scalar field in flat space . in ( [ eq : conseq ] ) , the derivative @xmath84 increases the fall - off with distance , but this does not hold for @xmath85 , which can operate on the retarded displacement @xmath86 in ( [ eq : boundpert ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath76 falls off more strongly than @xmath52 .",
    "the detailed calculation ( appendix [ sec : appc ] ) shows that @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "the expectation value of the stress - energy is derivable from the partial derivatives of the wightman function @xmath89 in the coincidence limit , with the unperturbed part @xmath45 given by ( [ eq : wconst ] ) and the perturbation @xmath46 by ( [ eq : deltaw ] ) .",
    "the unperturbed part becomes singular in the limit @xmath90 , but is easily regularized by subtracting the value of @xmath45 in free space without the mirror , _",
    "i.e. _ , the first term of ( [ eq : wconst ] ) , leaving the second ( image ) term as the sole contribution to @xmath91 .",
    "the perturbation @xmath46 is regular in the coincidence limit .    for a massless scalar field , two different stress tensors",
    "are commonly considered : ( a ) the minimal stress - energy , given classically by @xmath92 and quantum mechanically by @xmath93_{sym~;~x'=x } , \\label{eq : quantsetmin}\\ ] ] in which `` sym '' indicates symmetrization in ( x , x ) and in the partial derivatives ; ( b ) the conformal ( trace - free ) stress - energy , defined classically by @xmath94 and quantum mechanically by @xmath95_{sym~;~x'=x } , \\label{eq : quantsetconf}\\ ] ]    we begin by reviewing the frolov - serebriany@xcite results for _ uniform _ acceleration .",
    "differentiating the regularized form of ( [ eq : wconst ] ) , we easily find @xmath96 this last result is quite remarkable , because the conformal stress is not likely to vanish for a spherical mirror at rest ( it certainly does not for electromagnetic fields @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that the effects of uniform acceleration exactly cancel the static casimir stresses .",
    "the effects of non - uniform acceleration are more complicated .",
    "we shall simply quote the result for the conformal radial out - flux @xmath97 at a point @xmath98 outside the mirror , leaving to appendix [ sec : appb ] an outline of the derivation : @xmath99\\right\\}. \\label{eq : setpert}\\ ] ] the notation is as follows : the advanced and retarded times , @xmath100 and @xmath73 are defined as in ( [ eq : uvdef ] ) , and we write @xmath101 @xmath102 is the pseudo - angle along the ( unperturbed ) mirror trajectory ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath103 is the mirror s proper time ) . equation ( [ eq : boundpert ] ) , giving the trajectory of the perturbed mirror , is now written @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is a measure of the non - uniformity of the acceleration @xmath106 , which is given by @xmath107 in ( [ eq : setpert ] ) , @xmath102 refers to the pseudo - angle at the point @xmath108 , which is the nearest retarded point to ( r , t ) , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the corresponding expression for the canonical flux is too long to reproduce here , and is also deferred to appendix b.    the limit @xmath109 corresponds to a slowly accelerating , nearly plane mirror .",
    "this was the case studied by ford and vilenkin@xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that in this limit our result ( [ eq : setpert ] ) for the conformal flux ( and also our result for the canonical flux ) reduces to the expressions they give .    to obtain a more intuitive grasp of the physical meaning of the complex expression ( [ eq : setpert ] ) , we can evaluate the flux @xmath110 radiated at retarded time @xmath111  -   _ i.e. _ when the mirror is near its minimum radius @xmath112  -   as measured by a stationary observer at radius @xmath113 and the same retarded time . using ( [ eq : statflux ] ) , taking the appropriate limit of ( [ eq : setpert ] ) , and noting that @xmath76 does not contribute to the flux to leading order ( as discussed at the end of section [ sec : eval ] ) we find @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the proper radius of the mirror at the time of emission @xmath116 , and we have restored planck s constant to display the correct dimensionality .",
    "we recall that this perturbative result is correct to linear order in deviations from uniform acceleration @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , but the acceleration @xmath106 itself is arbitrary .",
    "our chief interest in this paper has been in the quantum flux radiated by the mirror and we have explicitly computed only those components of the stress - energy tensor from which it arises .",
    "however , the remaining components can be derived straightforwardly ( though with some labour ) from our expression ( [ eq : deltaw ] ) with the methods of appendix [ sec : appb ] .",
    "it would be useful to have these to round out the picture .",
    "the relevant green s functions for an unperturbed , uniformly accelerating spherical mirror have a simple closed form , and this has enormously simplified our perturbative calculation .",
    "this simplification is bought at a price : we are limited to spherical mirrors whose acceleration @xmath106 and proper radius @xmath120 are nearly reciprocals .",
    "we can not decouple the plane limit @xmath121 from the limit of small acceleration , and can not disentangle curvature ( casimir ) effects from the effects of acceleration .",
    "it is evident that much remains to be done before we can claim anything approaching a comprehensive understanding of the quantum dynamics of three - dimensional mirrors .",
    "to verify ( [ eq : deltaw ] ) , one needs to evaluate @xmath122 , where the integral operator @xmath123 is defined by ( [ eq : pertop ] ) and @xmath45 by ( [ eq : wconst ] ) .",

    "the problem is essentially solved by the following lemma .",
