    "events with a region of rapidity space devoid of particles ( rapidity gaps ) were first observed in cosmic ray data @xcite . the idea of diffractive dissociation of projectile and target to produce such events soon followed @xcite .",
    "later the interpretation of total , elastic and diffractive cross sections in terms of the exchange of an object with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , called the pomeron , proved very useful @xcite .",
    "f. low and s. nussinov suggested that the pomeron corresponds to the interchange of two gluons @xcite . in a latter development ingelman and schlein ( is )",
    "proposed that high @xmath4 jets could be diffractively produced via pomeron exchange and that this might probe the partonic structure of the pomeron @xcite .",
    "events containing rapidity gaps and jets were first observed by ua8 @xcite , giving rise to the field of hard diffraction .",
    "this area of interest has expanded considerably in the last decade , with the availability of high energy colliding beams .",
    "jet production with rapidity gaps have been observed at the tevatron @xcite and at hera @xcite .",
    "cdf and d  have studied dijet + rapidity gap events using data from the 1992 - 1996 tevatron @xmath0 collider run ( run i ) at center - of - mass energy (  ) = 1.8 tev , with a short run at 630 gev during that period . because of the large center of mass energy and large integrated luminosity , the new cdf and d  results can give further insight into diffractive processes .    the d  detector is described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "jets are found in the uranium - liquid argon calorimeters using a cone algorithm with radius @xmath5 in the @xmath6 plane @xcite .",
    "particle multiplicity is determined in the central region ( @xmath7 ) using the number of towers ( @xmath8 in @xmath9 ) with transverse energy ( @xmath3 ) above 200 mev in the central electromagnetic calorimeter and the number of tracks in the central drift chamber . in the forward region",
    "this multiplicity is measured by the number of towers with ( @xmath3 ) above 125 mev in the electromagnetic end cap calorimeter ( 2.1 @xmath10 ) and 500 mev in the hadronic end cap calorimeter ( 3.2 @xmath11 ) .",
    "because the last layer of the hadronic calorimeter ( at the limit of the forward acceptance ) is composed of stainless steel and produces less noise than the uranium sections , the threshold for particle detection was reduced to 50 mev in this layer . in addition , in the forward region we also use an array of scintillator hodoscopes , called l  detector , to tag the presence of charged particles in the region 2.3 @xmath12 .    the cdf detector , described in ref .",
    "@xcite , consists of a large central detector with tracking in a solenoidal field and calorimetry over @xmath13 . to measure particle multiplicities",
    ", cdf uses the central tracker ( @xmath14 mev ) , the central calorimeter ( @xmath15 mev corrected ) , and forward calorimeters ( 2.2 @xmath16 ) .",
    "for the last two months of the collider run , cdf installed three roman pot detectors to trigger on quasi - elastically scatted antiprotons .",
    "nearly all the pot triggers have @xmath17 , where @xmath18 = @xmath19 is the fraction of momentum lost by the antiproton and carried by the pomeron .",
    "two jets separated by a rapidity gap has been proposed as the signature of color singlet exchange ( cse ) carrying a high @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "rapidity gaps between jets have been observed both at the tevatron @xcite and at the desy @xmath21 collider ( hera ) @xcite .",
    "the measured rates of @xmath22 at the tevatron and @xmath23 at hera are too large to be accounted for by electroweak boson exchange and indicate a strong interaction process .",
    "d  and cdf have made recent studies of dijet data with central rapidity gaps .",
    "both experiments measure the color singlet fraction ( ) at   of 630 gev and 1.8 tev .",
    "the observed color singlet fraction includes the probability that the rapidity gap is not contaminated by particles from spectator interactions .",
    "this survival probability ( @xmath24 at 1.8 tev ) is assumed to be independent of bjorken @xmath25 and the flavor of the initial partons in the hard scattering @xcite but depends on   @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "cdf measures the fraction of colorless exchange to all opposite side dijets from the tracking distribution .",

    "the particle multiplicity in the central rapidity region is approximated by the multiplicity , @xmath28 , of transverse energy above 200 mev in the electromagnetic calorimeter , and by the track multiplicity in the central tracking chamber , @xmath29 .",
    "figure 1 ( a ) shows the d  multiplicity distribution for @xmath28 versus @xmath29 .    to calculate the fraction due to color singlet exchange , the leading edge of each @xmath28 distribution",
    "is fitted using a single negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) .",
    "the fraction of rapidity gap events ( ) is calculated from the excess of events over the fit in the first two bins ( @xmath30 or 1 ) divided by the total number of entries .",

    "measuring the color - singlet fraction as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and   probes the nature of the color - singlet exchange and its coupling to quarks and gluons .",
    "if the color - singlet dynamics are similar to single gluon exchange except for different coupling factors to quarks and gluons , the color - singlet fraction would depend only on parton distribution functions via @xmath32 .",
    "thus for a color - singlet that couples more strongly to gluons than quarks , the color - singlet fraction would fall as a function of increasing @xmath25 , since the gluon distribution becomes suppressed relative to the quark distribution as @xmath25 increases .",

    "the measured color - singlet fraction shows a slight rise as a function of dijet @xmath3 and @xmath33 .    to compare the experimental color singlet fractions to models ,",
    "d  uses herwig 5.9 @xcite , which includes a two - gluon exchange with bfkl dynamics @xcite , and uses cteq2 m parton distribution functions .",
    "in addition , d  uses the @xmath37-channel photon exchange process in herwig to investigate models in which the color singlet couples only to quarks with a massless photon - like singlet .    in the soft - color rearrangement",
    "model@xcite , initial state quarks have fewer color combinations and thus , a higher probability of being rearranged into a colorless state , than initial state gluons , i.e. @xmath38 , where the `` @xmath39s '' are the effective color factors representing the couplings to different initial state partons .",
    "a reasonable choice of color factors is @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "predictions of these models are simultaneously fit to the experimental @xmath3 and @xmath33 dependence of   at = 1.8 tev , letting the normalization float .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : d0_cse_et _ ] . the data favour color - singlet models that couple more strongly to quarks than gluons , but a single - gluon model ( no dependence ) can not be excluded .",
    "in the is picture of hard single diffraction , a pomeron ( color singlet object ) is emitted from the incident @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and undergoes a hard scattering with the @xmath44 ( @xmath43 ) , leaving a rapidity gap in the direction of the parent particle .",
    "the signature is two jets produced on the same side and a forward rapidity gap along the direction of one of initial beam particles .",
    "data was taken by the cdf detector at the end of run i using a trigger which requires tagging the recoil @xmath44 with `` roman pot '' detectors .",
    "the typical acceptance for these detectors is @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath18 is the fractional momentum lost by the antiproton and @xmath37 its four momentum squared . after applying several cuts to select events with a good reconstructed track in the roman pots ,",
    "cdf extracted the momentum fraction of the interacting parton in the pomeron , @xmath47 , for dijet events with @xmath48 , using the following expression :    @xmath49    the @xmath47 distribution for the pomeron was obtained by subtracting several background contributions in the data , of which the most importants are 1 ) non - diffractive dijet events accidentally overlapped with a roman pot hit , 2 ) meson exchange background and 3 ) double diffraction background .",
    "after subtracting these contributions from the data , then unfolding the detector acceptance by using simulations with a flat gluon distribution , the data was divided by monte carlo simulations based on pompyt@xcite using a flat gluon distribution and the standard donnachie and landshoff flux parametrization@xcite .",
    "the comparison , shown in figure  [ cdf_hsd ] , shows agreement in shape for @xmath50 , but there is a discrepancy in the normalization by about a factor of 6 , as well as an enhancement for the low @xmath47 region .",
    "= 4.0 in    the d  data were obtained using an inclusive jet trigger or a forward two jet trigger .",

    "allows the direct extraction of the fraction of events containing a rapidity gap at both energies .",
    "this gap fraction , including statistical and systematic uncertainties , is determined to be @xmath55 for the 1800 gev data and",
    "@xmath56 for the 630 gev data .",
    "work is in progress for the extraction of the pomeron parton distributions .",
    "central dijet events containing two rapidity gaps or a rapidity gap on the opposite side of a quasi - elastically scattered anti - proton have been studied by d  and cdf respectively .",
    "this event topology is consistent with double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) .",
    "the data can be used to give more information about the hypothesized pomeron .",
    "cdf took data at 1800 gev center of mass energy using the roman pot trigger to tag antiprotons .",
    "a sample of 27,000 events with a tagged @xmath44 and at least two jets with @xmath57 gev is obtained .",
    "low multiplicity events are selected by requiring @xmath58 in the 16 element beam - beam counters ( bbc ) on the same side as the pots .",
