    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) electronic systems are a very fertile ground for studying the physics of interacting many - body systems .",
    "gapless electron gases in one dimension possess universal low - energy properties which can be mapped onto the exact solution of the luttinger model.@xcite such 1d systems are collectively termed as luttinger liquids ( ll s ) . despite a number of remarkable predictions for electronic and thermodynamic properties of lls,@xcite some made more than twenty years ago",
    ", direct experimental verification for many of them has remained a challenge .",
    "this mostly owes to the high quality of quasi-1d systems necessary to bridge the gap between the usual landau fermi - liquid ( fl ) physics in three spatial dimensions and the ll physics in one dimension .    an important prediction of ll theory is that the low - energy elementary excitations of a one - dimensional metal are not electronic quasiparticles , as in the landau fl theory of three - dimensional fermi systems , but rather are separate spin and charge excitations that propagate at different velocities .",
    "an electron entering an ll will split into spin and charge excitations , and the electron propagator will have singularities corresponding to both velocities , in contrast to the case of a landau fl where there is a simple pole at a single fermi velocity . in this paper",
    ", we discuss evidence for spin - charge separation in tunneling between two parallel quantum wires at a cleaved edge of a double  quantum - well heterostructure .",
    "we use two approaches : one based on mapping out the elementary - excitation dispersions by measuring the conductance @xmath0 as a function of the magnetic field @xmath1 applied perpendicular to the plane connecting the wires and the voltage bias @xmath2 , and the other focusing on the conductance oscillation pattern , in the @xmath3 plane , arising due to the finite length of the tunnel junction .",
    "the two parallel 1d wires are fabricated by cleaved - edge overgrowth ( ceo ) , see fig .",
    "[ circuit ] . initially , a gaas / algaas heterostructure with two closely situated parallel quantum wells is grown .",
    "the upper quantum well is 20  nm wide , the lower one is 30  nm wide and they are separated by a 6  nm algaas barrier about 300  mev high .",
    "we use a modulation doping sequence that renders only the upper quantum well occupied by a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a density @xmath4 and mobility @xmath5 .",
    "after cleaving the sample in the molecular beam epitaxy growth chamber and growing a second modulation doping sequence on the cleaved edge , two parallel quantum wires are formed in the quantum wells along the whole side of the sample .",
    "both wires are tightly confined on three sides by atomically smooth planes and on the fourth side by the triangular potential formed at the cleaved edge .",
    "spanning across the sample are several tungsten top gates of width 2  @xmath6 that lie 2  @xmath6  from each other ( two of these are depicted in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] ) .",
    "the differential conductance @xmath0 of the wires is measured through indium contacts to the 2deg straddling the top gates . while monitoring @xmath0 with standard lock - in techniques ( we use an excitation of @xmath7  @xmath8 at @xmath9  hz ) at @xmath10  k , we decrease the density of the electrons under a gate by decreasing the voltage on it ( @xmath11 ) . at @xmath12 ,",
    "the 2deg depletes and @xmath0 drops sharply , because the electrons have to scatter into the wires in order to pass under the gate . for @xmath13 the conductance drops stepwise each time a mode in the upper wire is depleted.@xcite in this voltage range , the contribution of the lower wire to @xmath0 is negligible because it is separated from the upper quantum well by a tunnel barrier . when @xmath14 , the upper wire depletes and only the lower wire can carry electrons under the gate .",
    "this last conduction channel finally depletes at @xmath15 and @xmath0 is suppressed to zero .",
    "the measurements are performed in the configuration depicted in fig .",

    "the upper wire between these gates is at electrochemical equilibrium with the source 2deg .",

    "the drain is the 2deg to the right of @xmath17 ( the semi - infinite 2deg in fig .",

    "thus , any voltage difference ( @xmath2 ) induced between the source and the drain drops on the narrow tunnel junction between the gates .",
    "in addition , we can shift the momentum of the tunneling electrons with a magnetic field @xmath1 perpendicular to the plane defined by the wires .",
    "this configuration therefore gives us control over both the energy and the momentum of the tunneling electrons .",
    "the conductance for a spacing of 2  @xmath6 between gates @xmath16 and @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ gvb ] . the measured bright and dark curves in the plot can be interpreted as spectral peaks tracing out the dispersions of the elementary excitations in the wires.@xcite in the case of noninteracting electrons , the curves are expected to map out parabolas defining the continua of electron - hole excitations across the tunnel barrier for various pairs of 1d modes , one in the uw and the other in the lw . at small voltages , electron repulsion is predicted to split the curves into branches with slopes corresponding to different charge- and spin - excitation velocities , crossing at a point with @xmath20 and magnetic field necessary to compensate for the fermi wave - vector mismatch between the 1d modes ( in the following referred to as the `` crossing point'').@xcite    the 1d modes in the upper quantum well are coupled to the 2deg via elastic scattering which ensures an ohmic contact between the 2d well states and the states confined to the cleaved edge.@xcite ( this scattering is however weak on the scale of the junction length , not affecting the finite - size quantum - interference effects in tunneling.@xcite ) in addition to tunneling between the 1d states of the wires , there is a direct electron transfer from the 2deg to the lower wire , when the extended states have an appreciable weight on the edge .",
    "each of the quasi-1d wires carries several 1d modes . in our theoretical analysis",

    "we therefore consider tunneling between two coupled spinful modes having some effective intrawire and interwire interaction . to this end",

    "one therefore expects two velocities to be present at low magnetic - field and bias data : the antisymmetric spin- and charge - excitation velocities .",
    "the situation is more complicated at high magnetic fields capable of flipping the electron cleaved - edge chirality : a tunneled particle moves in the direction opposite to the hole left behind , decaying into a combination of symmetric and antisymmetric excitations across the tunnel barrier , even in the case of a perfectly symmetric double wire.@xcite we will not discuss this regime here .",
