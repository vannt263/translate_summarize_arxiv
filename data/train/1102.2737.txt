    "this interest has been sparked in part by the imminent commencement of high sensitivity radio observations by next generation radio telescopes such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) , which will have a detection threshold of 1 mjy ( where @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "such previous consideration of hot jupiter - like exoplanets has assumed that the auroral radio emission would be caused by a star - planet interaction reminiscent of either the solar wind - earth interaction or the io - jupiter interaction .",
    "the former is mediated primarily via reconnection of the planetary and interplanetary magnetic fields at the dayside magnetopause @xcite .",
    "this drives plasma flows within the magnetosphere that generate electric currents flowing between the magnetosphere and the resistive ionosphere , the upward magnetic field - aligned component of which , associated with downward - precipitating electrons , produces auroral and radio emissions .",
    "the latter interaction is thought to be mainly associated with the generation of alfvn waves in the vicinity of the moon io , caused by its motion through the rapidly - rotating planetary magnetic field and plasma @xcite .",
    "consideration of such processes has led to the extrapolation of a ` radiometric bode s law ' relating incident magnetic power to output radio power for the case of hot jupiter - like exoplanets orbiting extremely close ( at typically @xmath010 stellar radii ) of their parent stars .",
    "it has been concluded that such interaction may generate emissions at or above the lofar detection threshold @xcite .",
    "+ however , despite the importance placed by previous authors on stellar wind - planet and io - jupiter type interactions , significant components of jupiter s radio emissions , i.e.  the b - kom , hom and non - io - dam emissions @xcite , are thought to be generated by the large - scale magnetosphere - ionosphere ( m - i ) coupling current system associated with the breakdown of corotation of iogenic plasma in jupiter s middle magnetosphere , illustrated by fig .",

    "this process generates intense field - aligned electron beams which drive the brightest and most significant of jupiter s uv auroral emission , i.e.  the main auroral oval @xcite , and , coupled with particle mirroring and the absorption of particles in the loss cone , excite the cyclotron maser instability in the high - latitude low-@xmath5 plasma , which gives rise to the above radio emissions .",

    "these atoms are ionised by electron impact ionisation and thus become sensitive to the rotating planetary magnetic field , such that the newly - created plasma is picked up to corotation velocity .",

    "* ) . + as the plasma diffuses radially outward , its angular velocity drops ( inversely with the square of the distance if no torques act ) due to conservation of angular momentum , such that a radial gradient of angular velocity is set up in the equatorial plasma .",
    "this angular velocity gradient , when mapped along the magnetic field to the ionosphere , causes an equatorward - directed ( for jupiter s magnetic field polarity ) ionospheric pedersen current to flow , the @xmath8 force of which opposes the drag of the neutral atmosphere on the sub - rotating plasma .",
    "angular momentum is transferred between the ionosphere and the equatorial plasma by the sweep - back of magnetic field lines into a lagging configuration , such that the ionospheric pedersen current is balanced in the equatorial plane by an outward - directed ( again , for jupiter s magnetic field polarity ) radial current , the @xmath8 force of which tends to return the equatorial plasma back to corotation with the planet .",
    "current continuity between these two field - perpendicular currents is maintained via field - aligned ( birkeland ) currents , the inner upward component of which is thought to generate jupiter s main auroral oval emission @xcite .",
    "the current system was studied in detail theoretically by @xcite , who considered the effect of two poorly - constrained but important system parameters , the effective ionospheric pedersen conductance @xmath9 , and the plasma mass outflow rate @xmath10 , and they derived analytic approximations appropriate for small and large radial distances , the former of which will be instrumental in the present work . @xcite",
    "went on to examine the effect on the current system of modulation of the ionospheric pedersen conductance due to auroral electron precipitation , and @xcite and @xcite have studied the effect of field - aligned voltages . @xcite considered the effect on the current system of solar wind - induced expansions and contractions of jupiter s magnetosphere , and recently the modulation of the current system by diurnal variation of the ionospheric pedersen conductance caused by solar illumination has been considered by @xcite .",
    "+        in this paper we consider the application of the model describing jupiter s magnetosphere - ionosphere coupling current system to jupiter - like exoplanets with internal plasma sources such as active moons .",
    "the stability of satellites about exoplanets has been considered ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , since this is an important issue for the habitability of moons orbiting close - in ` hot jupiters ' . however , this is much less of a problem for satellites about more distant - orbiting exoplanets , which will be shown to be important for the present study .",
    "for example , @xcite could not place any mass limits on satellites orbiting planets beyond @xmath00.6  au .",
    "the vulcanism of io is driven by tidal dissipation , which also acts to dampen the eccentricity of the moon s orbit , such that the small eccentricities of the orbits of the galilean satellites of @xmath00.001 - 0.01 are only raised due to laplace resonance @xcite .",
    "the outer limit for stable orbits of a prograde moon was given by @xcite to be    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the semi - major axis of the planet s orbit , @xmath13 is the mass of the planet , @xmath14 is the mass of the parent star , @xmath15 is the eccentricity of the planet s orbit and @xmath16 is the eccentricity of the moon s orbit . for values appropriate to io ( i.e. @xmath17  au , @xmath18  kg , @xmath19  kg , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 , such that volcanic satellites orbiting jovian - like planets are expected to be stable ( as is of course observed in the solar system , e.g. io orbits at  5.9 @xmath6 , well inside @xmath23 ) . indeed , for jovian mass planets orbiting beyond 1  au , satellites with roughly io s orbital distance will be typically stable , and only the planets with very eccentric orbits and high mass parent stars ( e.g.  @xmath24  au , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 ) would be expected to be devoid of stable satellites at io s orbital distance . + both giant planets in our solar system which have been extensively studied by in - situ spacecraft , i.e.  jupiter and saturn , possess moons which actively outgas into the near - planetary space . at jupiter",
    "this is io , which emits material at the rate of @xmath01000  @xmath28 as discussed above , whilst at saturn this is enceladus , whose cryo - volcanoes emit water group ions at estimated rates ranging from a few to a few hundred  @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that such active moons may be relatively prevalent amongst jupiter - like exoplanets , and the resulting implications for detectability of auroral radio emissions is therefore considered here .",
    "we begin from the assumption that jupiter - like exoplanets are strongly illuminated by their parent star , such that the ionospheric pedersen conductance is high enough to maintain near - rigid corotation throughout the magnetosphere , a condition which , as reviewed below , maximises the field - aligned current density for a given magnetosphere .",
    "we then compute the currents , and thus the resulting radio power output , for varying configurations of jupiter - like exoplanets .",
    "note that such strong illumination could be associated with close ` hot jupiters ' , but equally applies to more distant planets orbiting active stars .",
    "the parameters examined are the plasma mass outflow rate , planetary orbital distance , and rotation rate .",
    "we show that , for planets with host stars more active than the sun , only relatively modest modifications from the jovian system parameters are required to produce potentially - detectable configurations , and by doing so we open up the catalogue of potential candidates for detection by radio telescopes such as lofar to a class of planet previously overlooked .",

    "we now consider how the above field model is modified by taking different values for the internal field strength and sub - solar magnetopause distance .",
    "as summarised by @xcite , there are a number of models which estimate the planetary field strength given the planetary rotation rate , the radius of the dynamo region , and the mass density and conductivity within the dynamo region , although recently @xcite used an approach which was independent of the planetary rotation rate . here",
    "we will assume for simplicity jovian values for the planetary radius , core conductivity and mass density , such that the planetary field strength is solely dependent on the planetary rotation rate @xmath64 .",

    "[ eq : bze ] and [ eq : fe ] , respectively .",
    "+ turning to the sub - solar magnetopause distance , this is expected to be dependent on the planet s orbital distance from the star via the stellar wind dynamic pressure @xmath76 , as discussed below , and on the internal field strength . for the former ,",
    "we employ the method of @xcite , who studied the effect on the current system of changes to the magnetospheric size due to solar wind - induced compressions and expansions of jupiter s magnetosphere .",
    "we note , however , that as well as considering the middle magnetosphere current sheet region described by the above field model , those authors also incorporated ` outer magnetosphere ' and open field line regions which are not included in this study since a significant flow shear at the open - closed field line boundary is not expected at planets with high ionospheric conductance , as considered here @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we set the reference boundary of the ` baseline ' field model to be at 85  @xmath58 , as shown by the red lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : bf ] , and modify the magnetic field model for smaller values of @xmath40 , by balancing the magnetic flux lost due to the closer outer boundary with the addition of the equivalent flux via a uniform southward field @xmath77 throughout the system , such that    @xmath78    where @xmath77 thus represents the effect of the magnetopause currents as seen inside the magnetosphere .",
    "the flux function @xmath47 is then equivalently modified by the addition of a term @xmath79 given by    @xmath80    such that an identical amount of flux ( @xmath81  nt  @xmath38 ) is contained within the boundary of the model for any value of @xmath40 smaller than 85  @xmath6 , and thus the ionospheric location of the outer boundary is kept fixed at @xmath82 . for values of @xmath40",

    "does result in a modest increase in the amount of flux contained within the model , thus modifying the ionospheric location of the outer boundary , but it is obvious from the difference between the lowest values of the red lines and the horizontal dotted lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : bf]b and c that this increase is very small , and the change in location of the open - closed field line boundary is less than @xmath85 , i.e.  less than observed changes in the location of jupiter s main auroral oval @xcite . the magnetic field and flux values for these modified field structures are shown for magnetopause standoff distances of 20 , 50 , 85 , and @xmath36 @xmath58 by the blue , green , red , and black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : bf ] , respectively .",
    "+ we now discuss how the magnetopause standoff distance @xmath40 is expected to depend on planetary orbital distance @xmath86 .",
    "the position of the magnetopause is dependent on the stellar wind dynamic pressure @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the stellar wind velocity and density , respectively .",
    "these parameters are related to the mass loss rate of the star , which is measurable by detecting ly-@xmath90 absorption from the collision of the stellar wind with the surrounding interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that stars more active than the sun ( which may be most important for internally - generated exoplanetary radio emission , as discussed below ) exhibit mass loss rates ranging between @xmath00.01 - 100 times the solar value , and conjectured that although younger , more active stars are expected to exhibit greater mass loss rates , the high magnetic field strengths of the most active stars may in fact act to inhibit stellar wind outflow . in view of these results , we employ solar wind velocity and density values as reasonably representative of the large observed range of stellar mass loss rates for active stars .",
    "we thus assume that the stellar wind velocity @xmath88 is constant beyond 10 stellar radii at @xmath91 , a value typical of those observed at both @xmath01  au @xcite and @xmath05  au @xcite .",
    "we then assume that the stellar wind density @xmath89 falls inversely with the square of the distance from the star ( thus neglecting plasma sources in the interplanetary medium such as interstellar pick - up ions which become increasingly significant toward the outer regions of the heliosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed values of the solar wind density actually vary significantly over a solar rotation period due to the formation of corotating interaction regions in the interplanetary medium , and at jupiter s orbit takes values between @xmath92 @xcite , with typical values being of order @xmath93 .",
    "we thus employ the representative value of @xmath93 at 5.2  au , such that the stellar wind dynamic pressure varies with orbital distance as    @xmath94    in the regime where the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) strength is negligible with respect to the planetary field , stress balance between the dynamic pressure of the shocked stellar wind plasma in the magnetosheath adjacent to the magnetopause and the magnetic pressure of the compressed planetary vacuum dipole yields    @xmath95    where @xmath96 for a high - mach stellar wind @xcite and @xmath97 represents the factor by which the magnetopause field is enhanced by magnetopause currents , given by @xmath98 for a sub - solar boundary of realistic shape , i.e.  lying between the values of 2 and 3 appropriate to planar and spherical boundaries , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "noting , however , that the precise values of @xmath99 and @xmath97 are in practise unimportant due to the @xmath100 exponent in eq .",

    "[ eq : rmpdip ] does not reproduce results consistent with observations of jupiter s magnetosphere , such that in the discussion that follows we employ results obtained using the @xcite relation . +     available using different pairs of system parameters @xmath10 and @xmath64 for , in panels ( a)-(d ) respectively , the xuv luminosity cases @xmath198  =  1,10,100 , and 1000 . also shown by the black contours are the maximum distances @xmath182 in pc at which sources of these powers are observable , assuming a detection threshold of 1  mjy , and the white contours show the orbital distances @xmath152 in au at which these maximum powers are available .",
    "labelled crosses refer to the spot combinations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigpow ] .",
    ", width=317 ]    we now extend the analysis to cover the full parameter space within the considerations discussed above .",
    "we thus examine the behaviour of the system over @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "we should note that angular velocities above @xmath03  @xmath72 would require planets more massive than jupiter and may thus have larger dipole moments , although as discussed above for simplicity we do not take this into account here and will be the subject of future study .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grids ] for the four different xuv luminosity cases .",
    "the colour indicates the maximum radio power @xmath230 available for each pair of parameter values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigpow ] by the powers at the locations of the vertical dotted lines , and the black contours show the maximum observable distances of sources emitting such radio powers , again assuming a spectral flux density threshold of 1  mjy .",
    "note the kinks are an artefact of the model indicating the change of behaviour where @xmath240 as discussed above .",
    "the white contours indicate the orbital distances @xmath152 at which these powers are available , which we note increase with decreasing @xmath10 and , to a lesser extent with increasing @xmath64 , as previously noted .",
    "this plot confirms the overall behaviour apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigpow ] , i.e.  that the radio power is essentially independent of @xmath10 , increases with @xmath72 , and increases with stellar xuv luminosity .",
    "thus , for stars with solar xuv luminosity , planets with @xmath241 are required to produce radio emissions detectable from beyond @xmath010  pc , but this is reduced to e.g.   @xmath242 for stars with @xmath198  =  1000 and @xmath243 . in all xuv luminosity cases , a significant number of parameter combinations within an order of magnitude of the jovian values are capable of producing emissions observable beyond 1  pc , in most cases requiring exoplanets orbiting at distances between @xmath01 and 50  au .",
    "for the two higher xuv luminosity cases , parameter combinations within an order of magnitude of jupiter s could generate emissions detectable beyond @xmath050  pc .",
    "in this paper we have provided the first consideration of magnetosphere - ionosphere coupling at jupiter - like exoplanets .",
    "we have estimated the radio power emitted by such systems under the condition of near - rigid corotation throughout ( a condition which maximises the field - aligned currents and thus the radio power for a given magnetosphere ) , in order to examine the behaviour of the best candidates for detecting internally - generated radio emission with next generation radio telescopes such as lofar .",
    "we have thus estimated for different stellar xuv luminosity cases the orbital distances within which the ionospheric pedersen conductance would be high enough to maintain near - rigid corotation , and we have then considered the magnitudes of the large - scale magnetosphere - ionosphere currents flowing within the systems , and the resulting radio powers , at such distances .",
    "we have also examined the effects of two key system parameters , i.e.  the planetary angular velocity and the plasma mass outflow rate .",
    "+ the key results of the study can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the radio power emitted increases with increasing system size , and thus increases with orbital distance within the limit of validity of the high - conductance approximation .",
    "2 .   the limiting orbital distance , which defines the maximum radio power available for a given set of system parameters , increases with stellar xuv luminosity and planetary rotation rate , and decreases with magnetospheric plasma mass outflow rate .",
    "the overall effect is that the radio power emitted increases with planetary rotation rate , but is essentially independent of plasma mass outflow rate since the higher powers available at a given orbital distance for increased plasma mass outflow rate are compensated for by a decrease in the maximum orbital distance to which the high - conductance approximation is valid .",
    "4 .   in all xuv luminosity cases studied , a significant number of parameter combinations within an order of magnitude of the jovian values are capable of producing emissions observable beyond 1  pc , in most cases requiring exoplanets orbiting at distances between @xmath01 and 50  au . for the higher xuv luminosity cases the observable distances for jovian mass planets can reach @xmath020  pc , and massive , rapidly rotating planets could be detectable beyond @xmath050  pc .",
    "however , we should note here the limitations of the simple model used in this study .",
    "first , we have not considered how the structure of the magnetic field changes with planetary angular velocity and plasma mass outflow rate .",
    "as noted above , jupiter s magnetosphere is partly inflated by the centrifugal force of iogenic plasma @xcite , such that systems with higher angular velocity or plasma loading would be expected to be further inflated , although this would be somewhat mitigated by the associated increase of the planetary field strength in the case of the angular velocity . however , as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , the effect of the stretching of the planetary field from a dipolar configuration into a magnetodisc structure is to amplify the upward field - aligned current density associated with the aurora and radio emissions by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , and therefore the power values derived here may be viewed as lower limits in this regard .",
    "second , we note that the field - aligned voltages obtained by the current - voltage relation used in this study may underestimate the true voltages if the location of the accelerator is fixed at a few planetary radii up the the field lines , such that these power values might again be underestimates . in a related point",
    ", we note that simply defining the plasma angular velocity as we have done ignores the effects of the significant field - aligned voltages , which act to de - couple the equatorial and ionospheric plasma angular velocities @xcite , an issue which should be studied in further works .",
    "further , we note that we have not considered at all the stellar wind interaction mediated by magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause , which at jupiter could be associated with the many variable and sometimes extremely bright polar auroras observed @xcite , and would thus sporadically increase the power output . nor",
    "have we considered the effect of changing stellar wind dynamic pressure , which at jupiter is known to modulate the intensity of the uv and radio emissions by factors of @xmath03 @xcite , and again , although the details of how this affects jupiter s auroral and radio emissions remain to be fully determined , this effect may also act to increase the output powers from those computed here .",
    "however , we also reiterate that our assumption of solar values for the stellar wind velocity and density may represent underestimates for stars more active than the sun , such as those much younger .",
    "higher stellar wind dynamic pressure values would decrease the size of the magnetosphere for a given orbital distance , thus reducing the emitted radio power .",
    "it is clear that the evolution of internally - generated radio emissions over the lifetime of a star should therefore be considered in future studies .",
    "we should also recall that we have only considered here planetary magnetic fields with the same polarity as those of jupiter and saturn , i.e.  with magnetic and spin axes co - aligned to first order , since this is the configuration that has been most studied for bodies in our solar system .",
    "however , it is probable that only 50% of jupiter - like exoplanets exhibit this polarity .",
    "the effect of reversed polarity is to reverse the direction of the current system , such that downward currents are replaced with upward currents and vice versa , such that the source population for the field - aligned currents in this case may be very different to that considered here ( see e.g.  @xcite for a discussion of field - aligned currents induced at jupiter s dayside magnetopause ) .",
    "the emissions from planets with the opposite polarity should be studied in future works .",
    "+ finally , we note that the implication of these results is that the best candidates for detection of such internally - generated radio emissions are rapidly rotating jupiter - like exoplanets orbiting stars with high xuv luminosity at orbital distances beyond @xmath01  au .",
    "this type of exoplanet has not previously been considered as potential detection candidates for next generation radio telescopes , but searching for such emissions such may offer a new method of detection of more distant - orbiting exoplanets less likely to be detected by those techniques which are biased toward close - orbiting ` hot jupiters ' . however",
    ", dual detections with radio telescopes and conventional methods would best constrain the planetary parameters .",
