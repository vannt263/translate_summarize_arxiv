    "the remarkable precision of the electroweak experimental data @xcite makes it possible to test the predictions of the standard model ( ) at the quantum loop level . after the successful prediction of the top - quark mass from the @xmath1 one - loop electroweak radiative corrections and the actual observation of the top quark signal at the tevatron ,",
    "the mechanism of the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , connected to the existence of the higgs boson in the , remains the last untested property of the .",
    "electroweak observables are influenced also by the presence of the higgs boson , but contrary to the @xmath1 dependence at the one - loop level they depend only logarithmically on the higgs boson mass . from the high - precision data at lep ,",
    "slc and the tevatron an upper limit of @xmath2  gev has been derived at the 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "this bound is not very sharp however . in a conservative conclusion",
    "the experimental limit may be interpreted in the as an indication for a scale @xmath3  tev .",
    "if the higgs boson is really heavy the study of its indirect effects at the quantum loop level at energies much smaller than @xmath4 will be one of the most important goals for the future experiments .",
    "starting from the two - loop level radiative corrections exhibit power growth for @xmath5 .",
    "leading @xmath6 two - loop corrections to the @xmath7-parameter @xcite and to vector boson masses @xcite were calculated more than ten years ago .",
    "these two - loop large higgs mass calculations were later extended to the case of the triple vector boson couplings @xcite .",
    "power counting shows , that only vertex functions with maximally four vector boson external legs can have two - loop large higgs mass corrections proportional to @xmath6 , while for five and higher point vertex functions no power growth of the two - loop corrections with the higgs mass is possible . in this",
    "talk we review the results of our recent paper @xcite , where these calculations were completed and the analytical expressions have been obtained for the two - loop @xmath6 corrections to quartic electroweak gauge boson couplings in the in the limit @xmath8 at low energy @xmath9 .",
    "in order to calculate the four vector boson vertex function contribution to the low energy effective action @xmath10 one has to take into account both one - particle irreducible ( opi ) four - vertex graphs and one particle higgs reducible graphs with four external vector particles , as shown in fig .  1 .    ( 12,5 ) ( 2,0 )    the two - loop topologies and one - loop topologies with counterterm insertions contributing to opi four- , three- , and two - point vertex functions",
    "are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the numbers in parentheses show the total number of corresponding topologies , the external lines are assumed to be topologically different .",
    "( 12,10 ) ( 2,0 )    here we present only the simplest terms of the two - loop low - energy effective action @xmath10 to order @xmath6 , which contribute to the @xmath11 anomalous quartic vertex , which is not present in the at the tree - level : @xmath12    as is well known @xcite the two - loop @xmath6 corrections to fermion scattering processes and triple vector boson couplings are very small , in spite of the @xmath13 enhancements , not only because of the small two - loop factor @xmath14 , but also because the dimensionless coefficients themselves are of the order of @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ quite small . in this respect",
    "the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath11 quartic couplings represent a drastic contrast to the other vertices .",
    "the dimensionless coefficients in ( [ zzzz ] ) are about 2 , _",
    "i.e. _ about 20 times larger , than the largest dimensionless coefficients for fermionic and triple vector boson couplings !",
    "as was mentioned previously , these particular vertices are distinguished , due to a contribution from two - loop higgs self energy insertion in the higgs - reducible graphs .",
    "these vertices receive a contribution from the @xmath18 and @xmath19 terms , which originate only from the two - loop higgs mass counterterm @xcite as a term proportional to a linear combination @xmath20 . in a sense these couplings could be considered `` genuine '' quartic couplings , which are the most sensitive to the details of the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the possibilities to probe the quartic vector boson couplings through the @xmath21- , @xmath22-fusion reactions @xmath23 at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) or the electron - positron linear collider are under intense study . here",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "in order to demonstrate the potential importance of large higgs mass corrections at high energies , we present in fig .",
    "3 the energy dependence of the born and corrected cross section of vector boson scattering integrated over scattering angles in the region @xmath29 for @xmath30 up to 1  tev for the very heavy higgs boson mass of 1.5  tev .",
    "the existence of a physical higgs particle with such large mass seems to be excluded due to triviality bounds ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we can consider however such a value of the @xmath4 as an effective ultraviolet cut - off in the theory without visible scalar higgs particle .",
    "we see that the growth with energy of the longitudinal vector boson scattering cross sections , which is the experimental indication of the existence of heavy higgs sector and/or strong interactions among longitudinal @xmath31 , @xmath32 bosons , is strongly modified by the two - loop @xmath6 corrections . at high energy",
    "the cross sections of neutral channel reactions are diminished , and those of charged channel reactions are enhanced .",
    "the large value of the two - loop correction is not only due to @xmath33 enhancement factor , but also due to violations of unitarity cancellations in the presence of anomalous quartic couplings . _",
    "e.g. _ at 500  gev correction to longitudinal @xmath21 scattering for @xmath34  tev is @xmath35 which gives correct order of magnitude for corrections in fig .",
    "of course at center - of - mass energy of 1  tev @xmath36 is not very much smaller than @xmath6 , which is the condition under which our low - energy effective action was calculated .",
    "nevertheless , we think that the qualitative trend , namely the fact that the account of large higgs mass corrections at high energy can change the value of the cross section by a large factor of @xmath37 , is important for all considerations of the signal from strong scattering of longitudinal vector boson at tev energy .    in fact , using the results of a thorough phenomenological analysis of the effects of anomalous quartic couplings in @xmath38 and @xmath39 collisions @xcite we can estimate the potential of tev colliders in investigating the effects of enhanced @xmath6 two - loop corrections more quantitatively .",
    "anomalous quartic couplings are defined in refs .",
    "@xcite through the following effective electroweak chiral lagrangians : @xmath40 + \\frac{1}{\\cw^2}(w^+z)(w^-z)+\\frac{1}{4\\cw^4}z^4\\biggr],\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal l}_5 & = & g^4\\alpha_5\\biggl[(w^+w^-)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\cw^2}(w^+w^-)z^2+\\frac{1}{4\\cw^4}z^4\\biggr],\\label{l5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "these operators introduce all possible quartic couplings among the weak gauge bosons , that are compatible with custodial @xmath42 symmetry @xcite .",
    "although our complete effective action given in @xcite does not obey this symmetry and as a consequence can not be described by the combination of operators ( [ l5 ] ) , the dominating terms which originate from two - loop higgs self energy insertions in the higgs reducible graphs have exactly the structure of lagrangian ( [ l5 ] ) . using our expression ( [ zzzz ] ) and analogous expressions for @xmath43 and @xmath44 vertices we can _",
    "calculate _ the coupling constant @xmath45 : @xmath46 in our approach the constant @xmath47 should be about an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the potential of the lhc and tev @xmath48 linear collider to study anomalous quartic vector boson interactions was carefully analyzed in recent papers @xcite .",
    "the limit on the anomalous quartic coupling @xmath45 which will be accessible at lhc is @xcite : @xmath49 an integrated luminosity of 100@xmath50 was assumed .",
    "the invariant mass of the vector boson pair was required to be in the range @xmath51  tev . as one could expect from fig .",
    "3 , the lower bound on @xmath45 is determined by the limits from same sign @xmath52-pair production , because for negative @xmath45 ( [ a5 ] ) correction in this channel is positive .",
    "study of the reaction ( [ ee - nnvv ] ) at the linear collider running at 1.6  tev energy will be able to improve the lhc limits by a factor of five @xcite .",
    "indeed , the 90% bound on @xmath45 , obtained by combining the @xmath53 and @xmath54 channels is @xmath55 for integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath56 .",
    "these limits were obtained under the assumption that only anomalous parameter @xmath45 is non - vanishing .    for the higgs mass of 1.5  tev the value of @xmath45 from eq .",
