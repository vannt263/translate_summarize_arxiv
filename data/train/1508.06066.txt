    "for a long time few - body effects have been attracting a lot of interest , especially in nuclear physics @xcite , resulting in some striking theoretical predictions like the efimov effect @xcite .",
    "more recently the tremendous progress for controlling interactions between ultracold atoms , has allowed to experimentally confirm those predictions @xcite . indeed the signature of triatomic efimov states was identified in an ultracold bose gas of cesium , where the formation of two - body bound states was either forbidden @xcite or permitted @xcite .",
    "an essential feature of efimov bound states is their universality in the following sense @xcite : they are characterized by two parameters , the two - body scattering length and the three - body parameter @xcite , which accounts for all the details of atomic interactions .",
    "using ultracold atomic and molecular gases , many extensions of efimov s original prediction @xcite were then explored or proposed , like four - body @xcite , or more - body bound states @xcite , the impact of fermi statistics @xcite or distinguishable particles @xcite , deviation from universality @xcite , or bound states of dipolar particles @xcite . beside efimov effect ,",
    "the theoretical modeling of collisions involving weakly - bound dimers revealed the enhanced stability against collisions of molecules composed of identical fermions with respect to those composed of bosons @xcite .",
    "besides , few - body collisions in the presence of dipole - dipole interactions were also explored @xcite .    in this respect",
    "the production of ultracold gases of lanthanide atoms is extremely promising @xcite .",
    "firstly their strong magnetic dipole moment creates anisotropic and long - range dipolar interactions that , unlike electric - dipolar interactions , do not need to be induced by an external field .",
    "secondly , erbium and dysprosium possess stable bosonic and fermionic isotopes , that were driven to quantum denegeracy @xcite . despite the absence of hyperfine structure , bosonic erbium and dysprosium present dense spectra of feshbach resonances @xcite , which were recently used to form very weakly - bound er@xmath0 molecules , _",
    "i.e. _ so - called feshbach molecules @xcite , through magneto - association technique .",
    "such er@xmath0 molecules look like excellent candidates to study few - body physics in dipolar systems .    in many investigations of few - body physics in ultracold gases ,",
    "atomic interactions are described with model potentials , _",
    "e.g. _  contact potentials , which is justified for atoms interacting through van der waals forces .",
    "however if the atoms carry a magnetic dipole moment , the resulting long - range and anisotropic dipolar interaction requires a cautious modeling which takes into accounts the internal structure of the atoms . in this article , using the multipolar expansion in inverse powers of the intermolecular distance @xmath2 @xcite , we characterize the long - range interactions between two weakly - bound diatomic molecules .",
    "we focus on the regime where the two molecules are approaching each other , that is to say when the intermolecular distance is larger than the mean interatomic distance inside each molecule . assuming that individual atoms keep their own identity within each molecule",
    ", we expand the intermolecular potential energy as the sum of pairwise atomic interaction energies . taking the example of two er@xmath0 feshbach molecules ,",
    "we show that , when expressed in the coordinate system of the molecule - molecule complex , the total dipole - dipole and van der waals interactions between all atom pairs are both expressed as a sum of terms proportional to inverse powers of @xmath2 , and involving effective molecular multipole moments .",
    "these terms , which are absent in the usual multipolar expansion , are strongly anisotropic with respect to the orientation of the two molecules . in addition , by calculating the electric - quadrupole moment of erbium ground level we show that the total quadrupolar interaction , which would in principle give rise to another series of @xmath8 terms , is actually much smaller than the dipolar and van der waals interactions",
    ". we will calculate adiabatic potential - energy curves that could be used in a future work to study er@xmath0-er@xmath0 collisions in the ultracold regime .",
    "the article is outlined as follows . in section [ sec : gene ] we present the general formalism giving the first - order and second - order energy corrections between arbitrary weakly - bound charge distributions .",
    "this formalism appears as a generalization of the usual multipolar expansion .",
    "then in section [ sec : expl - fm ] we consider the example of er@xmath0 feshbach molecules , focusing on their magnetic - dipole and van der waals interactions , and discussing also their electric - quadrupole interactions . with arguments based on the characteristic lengths associated with the multipolar expansion ,",
