    "in t hooft s large @xmath2 limit @xcite gauge theories are expected to be drastically simplified .",
    "thus , in this limit the gauge theory diagrams are organized in terms of riemann surfaces , where each extra handle on the surface suppresses the corresponding diagram by @xmath3 .",
    "the large @xmath2 expansion , therefore , resembles perturbative expansion in string theory . in the case of four - dimensional gauge theories",
    "this connection can be made precise in the context of type iib string theory in the presence of a large number @xmath2 of d3-branes @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider a limit where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , while keeping @xmath7 fixed , where @xmath8 is the type iib string coupling .",
    "note that in this context a world - sheet with @xmath9 handles and @xmath10 boundaries is weighted with @xmath11 once we identify @xmath12 , this is the same as the large @xmath2 expansion considered by t hooft . note that for this expansion to make sense we must keep @xmath13 at a small value @xmath14 . in this regime",
    "we can map the string diagrams directly to ( various sums of ) large @xmath2 feynman diagrams .",
    "note , in particular , that the genus @xmath15 planar diagrams dominate in the large @xmath2 limit , then no matter how large @xmath2 is , for sufficiently many boundaries the higher genus terms become relevant , and we lose the genus expansion .",
    "in fact , in this regime one expects an effective supergravity description to take over as discussed in @xcite . ] .",
    "if the space transverse to the d3-branes in the setup of @xcite is @xmath16 , then we obtain the @xmath17 supersymmetric @xmath18 gauge theory on the d3-branes , which is conformal . on the other hand",
    ", we can also consider orbifolds of @xmath16 , which leads to gauge theories with reduced supersymmetry versions of these orbifold theories via the compactifications of type iib on ads@xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the orbifold group ) were originally discussed in @xcite . ] .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , if we cancel all twisted tadpoles in such models , in the large @xmath2 limit the corresponding @xmath21 gauge theories are conformal .",
    "moreover , in the planar limit the ( on - shell ) correlation functions in such theories are the same as in the parent @xmath17 gauge theory .    in this paper",
    "we discuss non - conformal gauge theories within the setup of @xcite .",
    "such theories can be obtained by allowing some twisted tadpoles to be non - vanishing . in particular",
    ", we can have consistent embeddings of non - conformal gauge theories if we allow logarithmic tadpoles , which correspond to the twisted sectors with fixed point loci of real dimension two .",
    "in particular , even though the corresponding string backgrounds are not finite ( in the sense that we have logarithmic ultra - violet divergences ) , they are still consistent as far as the gauge theories are concerned , and the divergences correspond to the running in the four - dimensional gauge theories on the d3-branes .",
    "regularization of the aforementioned divergences can be conveniently discussed in the context of what we refer to as the brane - bulk duality , which is a consequence of the open - closed string duality . in particular , in certain non - trivial @xmath0 cases in the planar limit the corresponding gauge theories perturbatively are not renormalized beyond one - loop .",
    "in fact , in this limit the ( on - shell ) correlation functions in these theories are the same as in the parent @xmath1 non - conformal gauge theories . in the @xmath1 as well as",
    "the aforementioned @xmath0 cases the brane - bulk duality is particularly simple , and implies that the quantum corrections in the corresponding gauge theories are encoded in classical higher dimensional field theories whose actions contain the twisted fields with non - vanishing tadpoles .",
    "in particular , various quantum corrections can be obtained via integrating out the bulk fields in the corresponding classical action , that is , by considering the self - interaction of the d3-branes via the bulk fields .",
    "we give explicit computations in various @xmath21 examples in this context , including the treatment of divergences .",
    "we also discuss whether the brane - bulk duality can be extended to the non - perturbative level in the aforementioned theories . in the @xmath1 cases we argue that , since we are working in the large @xmath2 limit , the low energy effective action does not receive non - perturbative corrections .",
    "we also conjecture that this should be the case for the corresponding @xmath0 theories as well . in the @xmath22 cases we verify that there are no non - perturbative corrections to the superpotential in these theories in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss our setup .",
    "in section iii we discuss non - conformal large @xmath2 gauge theories which can be constructed within this setup . in section",
    "iv we discuss the large @xmath2 limit and brane - bulk - duality . in sections v , vi and vii we give details of classical computations that in the context of the brane - bulk duality reproduce quantum results in the corresponding @xmath1 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 gauge theories , respectively . in section viii",
    "we comment on the non - perturbative extension of the brane - bulk duality .",
    "in section ix we give a few concluding remarks . in appendix a we compute the brane - bulk couplings used in sections v , vi and vii .",
    "in this section we discuss the setup within which we will consider four - dimensional large @xmath2 gauge theories in the context of brane - bulk duality .",
    "parts of our discussion in this section closely follow @xcite . thus , consider type iib string theory in the presence of @xmath2 coincident d3-branes with the space transverse to the d - branes @xmath24 .",
    "the orbifold group @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) must be a finite discrete subgroup of @xmath27 . if @xmath28 , we have @xmath22 ( @xmath1 ) unbroken supersymmetry , and @xmath23 , otherwise",
    ".    we will confine our attention to the cases where type iib on @xmath29 is a modular invariant theory .",
    "if @xmath30 , then modular invariance requires that the set of points in @xmath16 fixed under the @xmath31 twist has real dimension 2 . ] .",
    "the action of the orbifold on the coordinates @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) on @xmath29 can be described in terms of @xmath34 matrices : @xmath35 .",
    "the world - sheet fermionic superpartners of @xmath32 transform in the same way .",
    "we also need to specify the action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton charges carried by the d3-branes .",
    "it is described by @xmath36 matrices @xmath37 that form a representation of @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath38 is an identity matrix , and @xmath39 .",
    "the d - brane sector of the theory is described by an oriented open string theory .",
    "in particular , the world - sheet expansion corresponds to summing over oriented riemann surfaces with arbitrary genus @xmath9 and arbitrary number of boundaries @xmath10 , where the boundaries of the world - sheet are mapped to the d3-brane world - volume .",
    "moreover , we must consider various `` twists '' around the cycles of the riemann surface .",
    "the choice of these `` twists '' corresponds to a choice of homomorphism of the fundamental group of the riemann surface with boundaries to @xmath20 .",
    "for example , consider the one - loop vacuum amplitude ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the corresponding graph is an annulus whose boundaries lie on d3-branes .",
    "the annulus amplitude is given by @xmath41 the one - loop partition function @xmath42 in the light - cone gauge is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the light - cone hamiltonian , @xmath45 is the fermion number operator , @xmath46 is the real modular parameter on the cylinder , and the trace includes sum over the chan - paton factors .",
    "the states in the neveu - schwarz ( ns ) sector are space - time bosons and enter the partition function with weight @xmath47 , whereas the states in the ramond ( r ) sector are space - time fermions and contribute with weight @xmath48 .",
    "the elements @xmath49 acting in the hilbert space of open strings act both on the left end and the right end of the open string .",
    "this action corresponds to @xmath50 acting on the chan - paton indices .",
    "the partition function ( [ partition ] ) , therefore , has the following form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are characters corresponding to the world - sheet degrees of freedom .",
    "the `` untwisted '' character @xmath53 is the same as in the @xmath17 theory for which @xmath54 .",
    "the information about the fact that the orbifold theory has reduced supersymmetry is encoded in the `` twisted '' characters @xmath52 , @xmath55 .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss one - loop tadpoles arising in the above setup . as was pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "if all tadpoles are canceled , then the resulting theory is finite in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "however , not all tadpoles need to be canceled to have a consistent four - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "in fact , we can obtain non - conformal gauge theories if we allow such tadpoles .",
    "the characters @xmath52 in ( [ gsq ] ) are given by @xmath56^{2+d_a } }   \\left[{\\cal x}_a(e^{-2\\pi t})-{\\cal y}_a(e^{-2\\pi t})\\right]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the real dimension of the set of points in @xmath16 fixed under the twist @xmath49 .",
    "the factor of @xmath58 in the denominator comes from the bosonic zero modes corresponding to four directions along the d3-brane world - volume .",
    "two of the @xmath59-functions come from the bosonic oscillators corresponding to two spatial directions along the d3-brane world - volume ( the time - like and longitudinal contributions are absent as we are working in the light - cone gauge ) .",
    "the other @xmath57 @xmath59-functions come from the bosonic oscillators corresponding to the directions transverse to the d - branes untouched by the orbifold twist @xmath49 .",
    "finally , the characters @xmath60 , @xmath61 correspond to the contributions of the world - sheet fermions , as well as the world - sheet bosons with @xmath49 acting non - trivially on them ( for @xmath55 ) : @xmath62~,\\\\   & & { \\cal y}_a = { 1\\over 2 }   { \\rm tr}^\\prime \\left[g_a ( -1)^f e^{-2\\pi t l_0}\\right]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where prime in @xmath63 indicates that the trace is restricted as described above .    for the annulus amplitude",
    "we therefore have @xmath64~,\\ ] ] where @xmath65^{2+d_a}}{\\cal x}_a(e^{-2\\pi t})~,\\\\   & & { \\cal b}_a=\\left({\\rm tr}\\left(\\gamma_a\\right)\\right)^2    \\int_0^\\infty { dt\\over t^3 }   { 1\\over \\left[\\eta(e^{-2\\pi t})\\right]^{2+d_a}}{\\cal y}_a(e^{-2\\pi t})~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these integrals .",
    "( the entire partition function vanishes as the numbers of space - time bosons and fermions are equal . ) for consistency , however , we must extract tadpoles from individual contributions @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for instance , cancellation of certain tadpoles coming from @xmath67 is required for consistency of the equations of motion for the twisted r - r four - form which couples to d3-branes ( see below ) . ]",
    "are generically divergent as @xmath68 reflecting the presence of tadpoles . to extract these divergences we can change variables @xmath69 so that the divergences correspond to @xmath70 : @xmath71 the closed string states contributing to @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) in the transverse channel are the ns - ns ( r - r ) states with @xmath72 ( and @xmath73 is the number of such states ) .",
    "the massive states with @xmath74 do not lead to divergences as @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "the divergence property of the above integrals in the @xmath70 limit is determined by the value of @xmath57 .",
    "given the orientability of @xmath20 the allowed values of @xmath57 are @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath76 there is no divergence in @xmath77 , so we have no restriction for @xmath39 . for @xmath78",
    "the corresponding twisted ns - ns closed string sector contains tachyons .",
    "this leads to a tachyonic divergence in @xmath66 unless @xmath79 for the corresponding @xmath49 twisted sector .",
    "finally , the ground states in the r - r sectors are massless , so we get divergences due to massless r - r states in the integral in @xmath67 for large @xmath80 for @xmath81 . in such sectors in non - supersymmetric cases",
    "we can also have tachyonic ns - ns divergences , while in supersymmetric cases we have massless ns - ns divergences .    to avoid complications with tachyons , for",
    "now we will focus on supersymmetric theories ( we will discuss non - supersymmetric cases in section vii ) .",
    "we must therefore consider massless tadpoles arising for @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath82 the corresponding integrals are linearly divergent with @xmath80 as @xmath70 .",
    "to cancel such a tadpole we must require that @xmath83 for the corresponding @xmath49 twisted sector .",
    "on the other hand , if such a tadpole is not canceled , in the four - dimensional field theory language this would correspond to having a _ quadratic _ ( in the momentum ) divergence at the one - loop order .",
    "this would imply that the corresponding four - dimensional background is actually inconsistent in the sense that either four - dimensional supersymmetry contains a twist with @xmath82 , we have @xmath22 supersymmetry . ] and/or poincar invariance must be broken propagate in four dimensions , in the presence of the tadpoles their equations of motion read @xmath84 ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 are the tadpoles , and the ellipses stand for terms of higher power in @xmath87 ) , so that we can _ a priori _ have solutions with broken four - dimensional poincar invariance . ] .",
    "this is related to the fact that in such cases the corresponding twisted closed string states , which propagate only in the d3-brane world - volume as they are supported at the orbifold fixed _ points _ in @xmath16 , have inconsistent field equations ( yet they couple to the gauge / matter fields describing the low energy limit of the d3-brane world - volume theory ) .",
    "in fact , as was pointed out in @xcite , generically uncancelled tadpoles arising in the @xmath82 cases lead to non - abelian gauge _ anomalies _ in the corresponding d3-brane gauge theories .",
    "thus , let us consider the following example .",
    "let @xmath88 , where the action of @xmath89 on the complex coordinates @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) on @xmath29 is that of the z - orbifold : @xmath92 ( where @xmath9 is the generator of @xmath20 , and @xmath93 ) .",
    "next , let us choose the representation of @xmath20 when acting on the chan - paton charges as follows : @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is an @xmath97 identity matrix ) .",
    "the massless spectrum of this model is the @xmath22 supersymmetric @xmath98 gauge theory with the matter consisting of chiral supermultiplets in the following representations : @xmath99 note that this spectrum is anomalous for non - vanishing @xmath100 ( the non - abelian gauge anomaly does not cancel ) unless @xmath101 . on the other hand , @xmath102 if and only if @xmath101 .",
    "here we should mention that not all the choices of @xmath37 that do not satisfy @xmath103 for @xmath82 lead to such apparent inconsistencies .",
    "thus , consider the same @xmath20 as above but with @xmath104 .",
    "the massless spectrum of this model is the @xmath22 supersymmetric @xmath18 gauge theory with no matter , so it is anomaly free .",
    "in fact , for any orbifold group @xmath20 containing a twist @xmath49 with @xmath82 we obtain an anomaly free theory only if @xmath79 or @xmath105 . in the latter case , however , as we discussed above , the corresponding background is nonetheless inconsistent , so we must require that for such twists @xmath79 .    finally , let us discuss @xmath106 cases . for such twists",
    "the corresponding integrals are only logarithmically divergent as @xmath70 . if such a tadpole is not canceled , that is , if the corresponding @xmath107 , in the four - dimensional field theory language this corresponds to having a _ logarithmic _ divergence ( in the momentum ) at the one - loop order .",
    "as we will see in the following , these logarithmic divergences are precisely related to the running in the corresponding gauge theories , which are _ not _ conformal ( even in the large @xmath2 limit ) .",
    "note that the corresponding twisted closed string states now propagate in two extra dimensions , so that the four - dimensional backgrounds are perfectly consistent - the tadpoles for these fields simply imply that these fields have non - trivial ( logarithmic ) profiles in these two extra dimensions , while the four dimensions along the d - brane world - volume are still flat ( and the four - dimensional supersymmetry is unbroken ) . in fact , the presence of such tadpoles does not introduce any anomalies in @xcite in a somewhat more complicated way . ] .",
    "a simple way to see this for general @xmath20 is to note that ( in supersymmetric cases which we are focusing on here ) an individual twist with @xmath106 preserves @xmath1 supersymmetry , so that the corresponding gauge theory is anomaly free .",
    "this then immediately implies that we do not have any non - abelian gauge anomalies in a theory with multiple such twists either . indeed",
    ", such anomalies would have to arise at the one - loop level . in the string theory language",
    "the relevant diagram is a @xmath15 , @xmath108 diagram ( the annulus ) with three external lines corresponding to non - abelian gauge fields attached to a single boundary .",
    "thus , if we attach two external lines to one boundary , while the third one to another boundary , the corresponding diagram will vanish - indeed , the chan - paton structure of such a diagram is given by ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 , are the chan - paton matrices corresponding to the external lines ) @xmath111 which vanishes as for non - abelian gauge fields @xmath112 , so @xmath113 as well for by definition @xmath109 are invariant under the orbifold group action as @xmath109 correspond to the gauge bosons of the gauge group left unbroken by the orbifold ( in particular , note that @xmath109 commute with @xmath37 ) .",
    "as to the aforementioned diagram with all three external lines attached to one boundary , its chan - paton structure is given by @xmath114 for twists with @xmath106 , each diagram of this type is @xmath1 supersymmetric as it does not contain any information about further supersymmetry breaking ( that is , the characters corresponding to the world - sheet degrees of freedom multiplying the chan - paton trace ( [ anomaly ] ) are those of an @xmath1 theory ) , so such diagrams do not introduce any anomalies .",
    "we therefore conclude that a theory with multiple @xmath106 twists with @xmath107 is also anomaly free .",
    "thus , as we see , in supersymmetric cases we can have non - trivial twists with @xmath81 .",
    "consistency of the background requires that @xmath115 while for @xmath106 we do not have such a restriction .",
    "in this section we discuss certain large @xmath2 gauge theories arising in the above setup with some twists @xmath49 with @xmath106 such that @xmath107 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , such theories are not conformal .",
    "the simplest examples of such theories are those with @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "perturbatively such theories are not renormalized beyond the one - loop order .",
    "we can also construct non - conformal @xmath22 supersymmetric theories in this way .",
    "in general such theories are rather complicated . however , as we will see in the following , certain non - trivial @xmath22 theories of this type have the property that in the large @xmath2 limit the leading ( that is , planar ) diagrams do not renormalize the gauge theory correlators beyond the one - loop order .",
    "in fact , the corresponding correlation functions in such an @xmath22 theory are ( up to overall numerical coefficients ) the same as in a parent @xmath1 theory .",
    "the simplest example of an @xmath1 theory is obtained if we take @xmath116 , where the action of @xmath117 on the complex coordinates @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) on @xmath29 is as follows : @xmath118 , @xmath119 ( where @xmath120 is the generator of @xmath20 ) .",
    "next , let us choose the representation of @xmath20 when acting on the chan - paton charges as follows : @xmath121 .",
    "the massless spectrum of this model is the @xmath1 supersymmetric @xmath18 gauge theory with no matter .",
    "the non - abelian part of this theory is not conformal , and is asymptotically free . as to the overall center - of - mass @xmath122",
    ", it is free , and can therefore be ignored .",
    "more generally , if we have twists with @xmath123 , the gauge group generically is a product of @xmath124 factors , and we also have matter , which can be obtained using the quiver diagrams ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is always an overall center - of - mass @xmath122 , which is free .",
    "other @xmath122 factors , however , run as the matter is charged under them . in the large @xmath2 limit , however , these @xmath122 s decouple in the infra - red , and can therefore also be ignored s are actually anomalous , and are broken at the tree - level via the generalized green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "in particular , in cases with twists with @xmath82 we have mixed @xmath125 anomalies . however , in the cases with matter we are interested in here we do have running @xmath122 s that are anomaly free .",
    "these @xmath122 s decouple in the infra - red in the large @xmath2 limit . ] .",
    "as we have already mentioned , within the above setup we can construct non - trivial @xmath22 supersymmetric theories which are not renormalized beyond the one - loop order in the planar limit .",
    "the idea here is similar to that in @xcite , where it was noticed that in theories with vanishing twisted tadpoles the planar diagrams are the same ( up to overall numerical factors ) as in the parent @xmath17 theory .",
    "this is because the diagrams that contain information about supersymmetry breaking always contain twisted chan - paton traces @xmath126 , which vanish in such theories . in this subsection",
    "we will consider theories where the planar diagrams are the same as in a parent @xmath1 theory in essentially the same way .    to obtain such models , consider an orbifold group @xmath20 , which is a subgroup of @xmath127 but is not a subgroup of @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 be a non - trivial subgroup of @xmath20 such that @xmath130 .",
    "we will allow the chan - paton matrices @xmath37 corresponding to the twists @xmath131 ( which have @xmath106 ) not to be traceless , so that the corresponding @xmath1 model is not conformal .",
    "however , we will require that the other chan - paton matrices @xmath37 for the twists @xmath132 be traceless .",
    "the resulting @xmath22 model is not conformal .",
    "however , in the planar limit the perturbative gauge theory amplitudes are not renormalized beyond one loop .",
    "the proof of this statement is straightforward .",
    "thus , consider a planar diagram with @xmath10 boundaries ( but no handles)-loop diagram in the field theory language . ] with all external lines attached to a single boundary , which without loss of generality can be chosen to be the outer boundary .",
    "such a diagram is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "next , we need to specify the twists on the boundaries . a convenient choice ( consistent with that made for the annulus amplitude ( [ partition ] ) ) is given by is non - abelian , and we have to choose base points on the world - sheet to define the twists .",
    "our discussion here , however , is unmodified also in this case . ]",
    "@xmath133 where @xmath134 corresponds to the outer boundary , while @xmath135 , @xmath136 , correspond to inner boundaries .",
    "let @xmath109 , @xmath137 , be the chan - paton matrices corresponding to the external lines .",
    "then the above planar diagram has the following chan - paton group - theoretic dependence : @xmath138 where the sum involves all possible distributions of the @xmath135 twists that satisfy the condition ( [ mono ] ) , as well as permutations of the @xmath109 factors ( note that @xmath109 here correspond to the states that are kept after the orbifold projections , so that they commute with all @xmath37 ) .",
    "note that the diagrams with all twists @xmath139 are ( up to overall numerical coefficients ) the same as in the parent @xmath1 theory , and therefore vanish beyond one loop .",
    "all other diagrams contain at least one twist @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "this follows from the condition ( [ mono ] ) .",
    "this then implies that all such diagrams vanish as @xmath142 in particular , this implies that the non - abelian gauge couplings do not run in the large @xmath2 limit beyond one loop limit compared with the leading one - loop contribution .",
    "this is analogous to what happens in theories discussed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the techniques used there to prove that the higher loop corrections are subleading are very similar to the one we are using here . ] . the anomalous scaling dimensions ( two - point functions corresponding to the wave - function renormalization ) for matter fields , the corresponding diagrams are ( up to overall numerical factors ) the same as in the parent @xmath1 theory , so they are not renormalized in the planar limit . finally , the yukawa ( three - point ) and quartic scalar ( four - point ) couplings are not renormalized in perturbation theory due to the @xmath22 non - renormalization theorem for the superpotential .",
    "let us now consider a simple example of the aforementioned gauge theories .",
    "thus , let @xmath143 , and let the corresponding twisted chan - paton matrices @xmath144 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath145 act non - trivially on the complex coordinates @xmath146 on @xmath147 , while leaving the coordinate @xmath148 untouched .",
    "moreover , let us assume that the orbifold group @xmath129 is abelian , and its action on the coordinates @xmath146 is diagonal .",
    "next , let @xmath120 be a generator of a @xmath31 group with the following action : @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "note that @xmath120 commutes with @xmath151 .",
    "the full orbifold group is given by @xmath152 , which is also abelian , and @xmath153 .",
    "let the twisted chan - paton matrix @xmath154 .",
    "then the theory is the @xmath22 supersymmetric @xmath155 gauge theory with chiral matter multiplets , call them @xmath156 and @xmath157 , in @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively ( in the following we will ignore the @xmath122 factors ) .",
    "note that there is no tree - level superpotential in this theory : @xmath160 this implies that we can break the gauge group down to the diagonal @xmath161 subgroup by giving the appropriate vacuum expectation values to the fields @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the resulting theory in the ir is then the @xmath1 supersymmetric @xmath161 gauge theory without matter . in the string theory language this corresponds to moving the d3-branes off the @xmath31 orbifold singularity , hence the @xmath1 supersymmetry of the resulting theory .",
    "before we end this section , as an aside we would like to discuss an embedding of pure @xmath22 supergluodynamics in the setup discussed in section ii .",
    "thus , consider the orbifold group @xmath162 with the generators @xmath163 and @xmath164 of the two @xmath31 s acting on the complex coordinates @xmath90 on @xmath116 as follows : @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "next , let the twisted chan - paton matrices be given by @xmath167 . the d3-brane gauge theory is then given by the @xmath22 supersymmetric @xmath161 super - yang - mills theory without matter ( plus an overall @xmath122 which can be ignored ) .",
    "note that the real dimensions of the points fixed under the twists @xmath168 are @xmath169 .",
    "the above embedding shows that at least perturbatively pure supergluodynamics possesses a discrete symmetry , which is not evident in the field theory language .",
    "thus , we have the @xmath170 symmetry as all the interactions involving twisted closed string states must be invariant under the orbifold group .",
    "in addition , we have a @xmath171 symmetry which permutes the closed string states coming from the @xmath168 twisted sectors .",
    "in particular , the generator @xmath172 of this @xmath171 group has the following action : @xmath173 thus , the @xmath171 subgroup does not commute with the @xmath174 subgroup .",
    "thus , @xmath163 and @xmath172 generate a non - abelian discrete subgroup of @xmath175 , namely , the _ tetrahedral _ group @xmath176 .",
    "thus , as we see , the perturbative large @xmath2 pure superglue theory possesses a discrete @xmath171 symmetry .",
    "in fact , this symmetry persists even at finite @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , even the diagrams with handles possess this symmetry as this symmetry is a symmetry of the underlying embedding of the pure supergluodynamics into string theory via the orbifold setup .",
    "in fact , within this setup the @xmath171 symmetry is a discrete _ gauge _ symmetry .",
    "indeed , instead of @xmath170 , the orbifold group can be chosen as the full tetrahedral group @xmath176 , where the generator @xmath172 of the @xmath171 subgroup of @xmath176 acts on the complex coordinates @xmath90 as follows : @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "if we now choose the twisted chan - paton matrix @xmath179 , then the d3-brane gauge theory is still pure superglue .",
    "this embedding makes it evident that the @xmath171 symmetry is indeed a gauge symmetry , so it might be an exact symmetry of pure superglue even non - perturbatively which is a subgroup of @xmath175 but not a subgroup of @xmath128 .",
    "the corresponding gauge theory has @xmath22 supersymmetry .",
    "note that the non - trivial twists in @xmath20 all have @xmath106 , and we can choose the corresponding twisted chan - paton matrices as @xmath105 , so that ( upon dropping the overall @xmath122 ) we obtain the @xmath161 pure super - yang - mills theory .",
    "an appropriate abelian subgroup of @xmath20 is then a symmetry of this theory . ] .",
    "we would like to end this subsection by pointing out one immediate consequence of the aforementioned @xmath171 symmetry - both the one - loop as well as the two - loop - function becomes gauge dependent . ] @xmath180-function coefficients in the pure supergluodynamics are multiples of 3 .",
    "as we mentioned in introduction , perturbative expansion of d3-brane gauge theories simplifies substantially in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "it is advantageous to work in the full string theory framework , which in a way is much simpler than the feynman diagram techniques .",
    "( at the end of the day we will take the @xmath181 limit , which amounts to reducing the theory to the gauge theory subsector . )",
    "thus , in the string theory language there are two classes of diagrams we need to consider : ( _ i _ ) diagrams without handles ; ( _ ii _ ) diagrams with handles .",
    "the latter correspond to closed string loops , and can be neglected as they are subleading in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "we will therefore focus on the diagrams without handles .",
    "the latter diagrams can be viewed as _ tree - level _ closed string graphs connecting various boundaries .",
    "this suggests that ( upon taking the @xmath181 limit ) in some cases ( which we will identify in a moment ) we might be able to rewrite the perturbative expansion in the large @xmath2 limit of the corresponding gauge theories in the language where various quantum corrections in the gauge theory are encoded in a _ classical _ higher dimensional _ field _ theory . the effective quantum action for the four - dimensional large @xmath2 gauge theory is then obtained by starting with the corresponding higher dimensional classical action , integrating out the bulk fields , and restricting to the gauge theory subsector .",
    "that is , we consider the d - branes in the background of the bulk fields that is created by the d - branes themselves .",
    "the field theory cut - off in this language arises precisely from the fact that , in the above setup , the twisted closed string states have tadpoles resulting in logarithmic profiles in the extra dimensions , and we need to regularize these profiles at the sources , that is , the d - branes , whose locations in the extra dimensions are given by points in @xmath29 .",
    "the aforementioned proposal that in the large @xmath2 limit various quantum corrections in the d - brane gauge theory should in some cases be encoded in a higher dimensional classical field theory is what we refer to as the _ brane - bulk duality_. in this subsection we would like to identify the cases where the brane - bulk duality is applicable as stated above .",
    "note that the brane - bulk duality is a consequence of the _ open - closed duality _ property of string theory .",
    "in particular , the diagrams without handles in the transverse closed string channel can indeed be viewed as tree - level closed string graphs connecting various boundaries . at the one - loop order the corresponding diagram ( up to external lines ) is an annulus , where two boundaries are connected by a single closed string tube . in particular",
    ", this diagram does _ not _ involve closed string interactions .",
    "moreover , in the field theory limit @xmath181 contributions due to the massive closed string states in the transverse closed string channel are always finite .",
    "that is , these contributions correspond to heavy string _",
    "thresholds_. in the field theory language they translate into subtraction scheme dependent artifacts , which arise due to a particular choice of regularization .",
    "thus , at the one - loop order the contributions due to massive string modes can be absorbed into the subtraction scheme dependence , so that in the field theory limit the brane - bulk duality indeed holds - various one - loop corrections in the gauge theory can be computed by calculating the classical d - brane self - interaction via the massless bulk fields .    beyond the one - loop order , however , that is , when the number of boundaries is greater than two , we must include closed string interactions in the transverse closed string channel .",
    "the massive closed string states are now expected to contribute in a non - trivial way .",
    "in particular , _ a priori _ there is no longer a clear interpretation of these contributions in terms of thresholds .",
    "another way of phrasing this is that at higher loop orders we can have mixed contributions coming from both massless as well as massive states .",
    "that is , in general the brane - bulk duality can still be formulated except that at higher loop orders it will involve massless as well as _",
    "infinitely _ many massive states as far as the corresponding higher dimensional classical `` field theory '' is concerned . in particular",
    ", in general this classical `` field theory '' is nothing but the corresponding closed string theory , so we are back to the original open - closed string duality .",
    "there are , however , non - trivial cases where in the large @xmath2 limit the bulk closed string theory can be consistently truncated to a field theory containing only a finite number of massless fields .",
    "these cases are those where in the planar limit the gauge theory perturbatively is not renormalized beyond one loop .",
    "thus , this is clearly the case for @xmath1 theories . in theories without matter",
    "this , in fact , holds even at finite @xmath2 . in theories with matter",
    ", however , we have running @xmath122 s whose decoupling is ensured only in the large @xmath2 limit .    in subsection iiia we discussed @xmath22 theories which perturbatively are not renormalized beyond the one - loop order in the planar limit .",
    "it is clear that the aforementioned formulation of the brane - bulk duality also holds in such theories , where , once again , various quantum corrections in the gauge theory are encoded in a higher dimensional classical field theory with a finite number of massless fields .",
    "in fact , in @xmath1 as well as @xmath22 theories the bulk fields entering the relevant part of the corresponding higher dimensional classical action are _ twisted _ closed string states . indeed , at the one - loop order the diagrams involving untwisted closed string states in the transverse closed string channel are @xmath17 supersymmetric , so that they do not contribute into the renormalization of the corresponding ( on - shell ) gauge theory correlators .    to clarify the above discussion ,",
    "let us give a schematic description of the above procedure for obtaining quantum corrections in the corresponding gauge theories via the brane - bulk duality .",
    "thus , we start from the classical action @xmath182+s_{\\rm{\\small bulk}}[\\sigma]+   s_{\\rm{\\small int}}[\\phi,\\sigma]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath183 is a collective notation for the ( fractional ) d3-brane world - volume fields , while @xmath184 is a collective notation for the _ massless twisted bosonic _ ( ns - ns and r - r ) bulk fields ; @xmath185 $ ] is the classical four - dimensional action for the brane fields @xmath183 , while @xmath186 $ ] is the classical higher dimensional action for the bulk fields @xmath184 ( note that some of these fields such as twisted closed string states propagate in less than 10 dimensions ) ; finally , @xmath187 $ ] , which is a classical four - dimensional functional ( with the integral over the ( fractional ) d3-brane world - volume ) , describes the coupling of the bulk fields to the brane fields , as well as to the brane itself ( in particular , it includes all tadpoles ) .",
    "since here we are interested in one - loop corrections in the gauge theory language , the action @xmath186 $ ] contains only the terms quadratic in @xmath184 ( that is , the kinetic terms ) , while @xmath187 $ ] contains only the terms linear in @xmath184 .",
    "moreover , the fields @xmath184 include only the twisted fields with non - vanishing ( logarithmic ) tadpoles .",
    "next , we solve the equations of motion for @xmath184 following from the above action : @xmath188 in particular , we are interested in the solution where the fields @xmath184 do _ not _ explicitly depend on the coordinates @xmath189 along the d3-brane world - volume , but only functionally via @xmath190 ; this solution , however , does in general explicitly depend on the coordinates @xmath191 transverse to the d - branes .",
    "let us denote this solution via @xmath192 .",
    "the effective quantum action for the fields @xmath183 in the large @xmath2 limit is then given by @xmath193=   s_{\\rm{\\small brane}}[\\phi]+   s_{\\rm{\\small int}}[\\phi,{\\overline\\sigma}]~.\\ ] ] note that @xmath194 are generically divergent , so we need to further clarify the meaning of the second term in ( [ quantum ] ) .",
    "thus , let @xmath195 note that @xmath196 are independent of @xmath189 , and , in fact , are nothing but the tadpoles for the fields @xmath184 . if all @xmath79 ( for @xmath81 ) , then there are no tadpoles for the corresponding twisted fields ( that is , the corresponding @xmath197 ) , and the large @xmath2 gauge theory is finite @xcite factors can still run , but , as we have already mentioned , in the large @xmath2 limit they decouple in the infra - red , and can therefore be ignored . ] . on the other hand , if some @xmath107 for twists with @xmath106 , some divergences no longer cancel , and we need to regularize @xmath194 in ( [ quantum ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the corresponding divergences are only logarithmic , and , in fact , correspond to the running in the four - dimensional gauge theory , which is no longer conformal .      in this subsection",
    "we would like to address one technical point in the context of the brane - bulk duality , namely , the issue of regularizing the aforementioned divergences . here",
    "we will consider a simple toy model which possesses the main ingredients for illustrating the regularization procedure .",
    "in fact , as we will see in the following sections , this model actually captures all the key features of the @xmath1 models as well the @xmath22 models discussed in subsection iiia .",
    "thus , consider the six dimensional theory with the following action : @xmath198 here @xmath199 is a six dimensional scalar field , whose dimension is @xmath200 ; @xmath201 is a four - dimensional operator with dimension @xmath202 localized on the hypersurface @xmath203 ; the couplings @xmath204 ( which are assumed to be non - vanishing ) are dimensionless ; finally , @xmath205 is a parameter of dimension ( length ) .    in the above action @xmath156 is an analog of a twisted closed string state with a non - vanishing tadpole ( the last term in ( [ toy ] ) ) ; @xmath203 plays the role of a 3-brane ; @xmath206 is an analog of a dimension - four gauge theory operator such as @xmath207 ; finally , @xmath208 is analogous to @xmath209 .",
    "following the procedure described in the previous subsection , we look for a solution to the equation of motion for @xmath156 : @xmath210   \\delta^{(2)}(z)~.\\ ] ] here @xmath211 are the coordinates transverse to the 3-brane ( whose location is chosen to be @xmath212 ) ; also , we use the notation @xmath213 .",
    "it is convenient to fourier transform to the momentum space @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are the momenta corresponding to @xmath217 and @xmath218 , respectively .",
    "thus , we have the following solution @xmath219~.\\ ] ] this gives @xmath220~.\\ ] ] the corresponding effective quantum action on the 3-brane is then given by @xmath221{\\cal o}_4(p=0 )   + b^2 l^4\\int { d^4 p\\over(2\\pi)^4}\\int { d^2 k\\over ( 2\\pi)^2 }   { { \\cal o}_4(p){\\cal o}_4(-p)\\over { k^2+p^2}}+\\dots~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ellipses in the last line stand for a divergent constant piece ( which does not contain the operator @xmath206 , and is proportional to @xmath222 as it is solely due to the presence of the @xmath156 tadpole ) .",
    "the second term in the last line in ( [ toyqu ] ) is a non - local higher dimensional operator , and it disappears in the @xmath223 limit .",
    "the first term containing @xmath224 is the same as that in the classical 3-brane world - volume action except for the corresponding coupling - the quantum coupling in @xmath225 is a renormalized coupling : @xmath226 here @xmath227 is an ultra - violet ( uv ) cut - off , while @xmath228 is the infra - red ( ir ) cut - off . in the four - dimensional 3-brane world - volume field theory language",
    "the ir cut - off is interpreted as the renormalization group ( rg ) scale at which the renormalized coupling @xmath229 is measured .",
    "thus , if in the above toy model we adapt the interpretation of the previous subsection , from the classical dynamics of the bulk field @xmath156 we will obtain the `` one - loop '' renormalization of the 3-brane world - volume field theory .",
    "in fact , in this model the 3-brane world - volume theory is not renormalized beyond the `` one - loop '' order .",
    "in this section we would like to apply the brane - bulk duality discussed in the previous section to gauge theories arising in the orbifold construction discussed in section ii . here",
    "we will focus on the simplest examples of this type , in particular , those with @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "perturbatively such gauge theories are not renormalized beyond the one - loop order even for finite @xmath2 .",

    "then the second @xmath161 can be treated as the global symmetry group for the first @xmath161 , and we have the @xmath161 gauge theory with @xmath2 flavors of quarks @xmath410 , @xmath411 , where @xmath412 and @xmath413 transform in the fundamental @xmath414 respectively anti - fundamental @xmath415 of the gauge group @xmath161 .",
    "the low energy dynamics is described in terms of the gauge invariant degrees of freedom given by the mesons @xmath416 and baryons @xmath417 @xcite : @xmath418 the classical moduli space in this theory receives quantum corrections , which can be accounted for via the following superpotential ( here @xmath419 is a lagrange multiplier related to the `` glueball '' field via @xmath420 ) @xcite : @xmath421 where @xmath404 is the dynamically generated scale of the theory , which is given by : @xmath422 once again , @xmath423 goes to zero in the large @xmath2 limit , so that the classical constraint @xmath424 is unmodified in this limit .",
    "thus , in this theory the classical superpotential , which vanishes , is indeed exact in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the brane - bulk duality discussed in the previous sections in the context of the aforementioned gauge theories might hold even non - perturbatively , so that the corresponding low energy effective quantum action is not renormalized beyond one loop in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "we would like to end our discussion with a few concluding remarks .",
    "first , one natural generalization we can consider is to extend the above discussion to the cases containing @xmath425 gauge groups .",
    "this can be done via orientifolding , that is , by including orientifold planes in the setup of section ii in the spirit of @xcite . in the @xmath1 cases we expect no subtleties , but in the @xmath22 cases with twists with @xmath82 some caution is needed @xcite due to the subtleties discussed in @xcite .",
    "another point we would like to comment on is the following .",
    "recently , in the brane world context @xcite , it was pointed out in @xcite that the einstein - hilbert term is generically expected to be induced via loop corrections on a brane as long as the brane world - volume theory is not conformal .",
    "subsequently , it was argued in @xcite that this effect should arise in the context of non - conformal gauge theories from d3-brane , in particular , this is expected to be the case in theories discussed in this paper .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether the brane - bulk duality can be used for simplifying computation of such corrections on the d3-branes .",
    "we would like to thank gregory gabadadze , rajesh gopakumar , martin roek , tom taylor , henry tye , cumrun vafa and slava zhukov for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation . z.k .",
    "would also like to thank albert and ribena yu for financial support .",
    "in section v we used various brane - bulk couplings in the @xmath31 orbifold examples . these couplings can be computed within the boundary state formalism , where one computes the couplings of the boundary states to the twisted closed string states in the presence of non - trivial d - brane field backgrounds @xcite . here",
    ", however , since we only need the couplings relevant for the one - loop corrections in the gauge theory language , we will take a shortcut and deduce these couplings using the annulus amplitude in the presence of d - brane field backgrounds",
    ".    the annulus amplitude in the light - cone gauge is given by ( here @xmath120 is the generator of the @xmath31 orbifold twist ) : @xmath426~.\\ ] ] here we assume that we have a non - trivial _ constant _ background gauge field along the brane . the annulus amplitude @xmath427 then is almost the same as in the case without the background field , which we discussed in section ii , with the difference that some of the open string oscillator modings are modified @xcite . for our purposes here",
    "it will suffice to consider the background field of the form ( @xmath246 , @xmath428 , is the d3-brane gauge field strength ) : @xmath429 where @xmath430 is a cartan generator of the @xmath18 gauge group , which we will take to be hermitian .",
    "let @xmath431 , @xmath432 , be the eigenvalues of @xmath430 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce complex combinations of the world - sheet bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom corresponding to the directions @xmath433 ( so that instead of two real world - sheet bosons and two real world - sheet fermions corresponding to these directions we have one complex world - sheet boson and one complex world - sheet fermion ) .",
    "then the modings of these complex world - sheet degrees of freedom are modified as follows ( modings of other world - sheet degrees of freedom are unchanged ) : @xmath434 where @xmath435 is given by : @xmath436~. \\label{eq : epsilon}\\ ] ] here the indices @xmath437 label the two ends of the open string .",
    "the cylinder amplitude is given by @xcite : @xmath438   e^{-{t \\over 2\\pi\\alpha^\\prime}~x_{\\alpha\\beta}^2}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath439 is square of the distance ( in the two real extra directions untouched by the orbifold ) between the d3-branes labeled by @xmath440 and @xmath180 .",
    "the factor of @xmath441 in the denominator comes from the bosonic zero modes in the directions @xmath442 .",
    "the factor @xmath443 can be understood from the requirement that in the @xmath444 limit we must reproduce the corresponding answer ( see below ) .",
    "in particular , the untwisted character @xmath445 and the twisted character @xmath446 are given by .",
    "thus , for instance , we could have chosen the phase of the last term in the square brackets in ( [ u ] ) as @xmath48 instead of @xmath47 .",

    "here we would like to extract couplings of the massless closed string states to the d - branes .",
    "this can be done by extracting the leading behavior of the annulus amplitude for @xmath68 . using modular transformation properties of the above characters , we obtain : @xmath457\\big|_{{\\rm { \\small ns - ns } } } -    2\\cos(\\pi\\delta)\\big|_{{\\rm{\\small r - r}}}\\right\\}~,\\\\   & & t\\sim { 2t\\over \\sin(\\pi\\delta ) } \\left\\{1\\big|_{{\\rm { \\small ns - ns } } } -    \\cos(\\pi\\delta)\\big|_{{\\rm{\\small r - r}}}\\right\\}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where individual contributions due to the ns - ns and r - r exchanges are shown .",
