    "later venkov @xcite proved that these three properties are sufficient for polytope to be a parallelohedron .",
    "the last property of minkowski allows us to introduce a notion of _ belt _ as a set of ( 4 or 6 ) facets parallel to a given face of codimension 2 .",
    "the facets of a belt are projected exactly into edges of two - dimensional parallelohedron , i.e. parallelogram or centrally symmetric hexagon .    using a notion of belt",
    "we can introduce the belt diameter of a given parallelohedron @xmath5 .",
    "we can construct the _ venkov graph _ @xcite of @xmath5 in the following way .",
    "the vertex set of the venkov graph is the set of pairs of opposite facets and two pairs of facets are connected with an edge if and only if there exist a belt containing both pairs .",
    "then the _ belt diameter _ of parallelohedron @xmath5 is the diameter of its venkov graph , in the other words the belt diameter of a parallelohedron is the maximal number of belts that we need to use in order to travel from one facet to another . a",
    "_ belt path _ of a parallelohedron is a sequence of its facets such that any two correspondent facets are in the same belt , so belt diameter of a polytope is the maximal length of the shortest belt path between two of its facets . since",
    "every belt of a parallelohedron consist of 4 or 6 facets then the venkov graph can be obtained by gluing vertices correspondent to opposite facets in the edge graph of the dual polytope .",
    "one of the main conjecture in the parallelohedra theory is the voronoi conjecture @xcite that claims that every parallelohedron is an affine image of dirichlet - voronoi polytope for some lattice .",
    "this conjecture was proved for several classes of parallelohedra in works of voronoi @xcite , zhitomirskii @xcite , erdahl @xcite , and ordine @xcite .",
    "one of the main methods that was used in these work ( except @xcite ) is the method of canonical scaling introduced by voronoi in @xcite .",
    "this method constructs a special function ( canonical scaling ) on the set of facets of parallelohedron by moving from one facet to another facet in the same belt .",
    "so relatively small belt diameter of parallelohedron @xmath5 can give us a way to prove the voronoi conjecture for @xmath5 because it will be easier to prove the existence of canonical scaling for @xmath5 .",

    "and by lemma [ belt ] this facet @xmath1 is in one belt with each red or blue facets because removing a leaf from a tree will give us a new connected graph .",
    "now assume that belt distance between red and blue facets is equal to 2 , then there exists a facet @xmath1 with correspondent partition of vertex set of graph @xmath44 into sets @xmath120 and @xmath121 that satisfy lemma [ belt ] for both red and blue facets .",
    "so one of these sets is a subset of one of red vertex sets @xmath183 or @xmath197 without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath198 if @xmath199 ( here and later @xmath200 denotes the cardinality of the vertex set @xmath122 ) then both subgraphs @xmath201 and @xmath202 has at least one red edge because @xmath203 and @xmath184 has at least two vertices and @xmath184 is connected by red edges , moreover by lemma [ belt ] the intersection set @xmath204 must be connected and there are only red edges in subgraph @xmath205 . by lemma [ belt ] applied to the blue facet and the facet @xmath1 one of sets @xmath120 and @xmath121 is a subset of one of sets @xmath185 and @xmath186 but in this case there is a red edge that connects two vertices from @xmath185 or two vertices from @xmath186 and this contradicts with lemma [ trees ] , so @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "again by lemma [ belt ] all three induced subgraphs @xmath208 and @xmath209 must be connected and graph @xmath210 is connected if and only if @xmath59 is a leaf of the red subgraph . by the same reason @xmath59 must be a leaf of the blue subgraph of @xmath47    [ pimax ] the belt distance between red and blue facets in a @xmath3-dimensional symmetric @xmath0-zonotope is not greater than @xmath17 if @xmath211 or @xmath212 and is not greater than @xmath18 in other cases .",
    "these bounds are sharp .",
    "so in notations of lemma @xmath213 @xmath214    note that zonotope from lemma [ sinvert ] satisfies this lemma and further we will consider that all red and blue components has at least two vertices .",
    "also this zonotope gives us an example for @xmath215 and @xmath212 so we will need to construct examples only for other dimensions .",
    "now suppose that the zonotope @xmath169 is distinct from the zonotope described in lemma [ sinvert ] .",
    "we have three possibilities .",
    "if @xmath215 then every red component is a tree with at least @xmath17 vertices and then there are at least two leaves in each component so there are at least four red leaves and by the same reason there are at least four blue leaves",
    ". there are @xmath216 vertices in graph @xmath44 in total so there is a vertex that is a blue and a red leaf at the same time .",
    "so we can apply lemma [ leaves ] and this case is done .",
    "if @xmath212 then there are @xmath217 vertices in graph @xmath44 and if each of red and blue forests has at least @xmath218 leaves then this case is similar to the previous one .",
    "assume that there is no vertex of @xmath44 that is red and blue leaf at the same time then one of forests , say red , has exactly @xmath219 leaves and in this case both trees @xmath205 and @xmath209 must be just some simple paths .",
    "there are three possibilities for number of vertices in sets @xmath183 and @xmath184 : 2 and 7 , 3 and 6 , 4 and 5 . in all three cases",
    "one can easily check by simple enumeration that any graph that satisfies lemma [ trees ] and corollary [ oneedge ] has a vertex of degree 2 that incident to one red and one blue edges .    and",
    "the only case that we still need to prove is @xmath220 or @xmath221 in graph @xmath44 there are @xmath37 vertices and @xmath165 edges so there is a vertex @xmath59 with degree at most 3 . if @xmath59 has degree 2 then it is a leaf in both red and blue subgraph and belt distance between red and blue facets is 2 .",
    "if @xmath59 has degree 3 then we can assume that there is one red edge and two blue edges at @xmath196 consider the partition of the vertex set @xmath14 of @xmath44 into sets @xmath222 and @xmath223 this partition determines a facet of @xmath2 because red edges between vertices of @xmath224 forms two trees and there are at least one blue edge in correspondent induced subgraph since there are at least 6 blue edges in @xmath44 and we deleted only 2 of them . by lemma [ belt ]",
    "facet @xmath1 is in one belt with the red facet of @xmath115    the facet @xmath1 and the blue facet of @xmath2 has @xmath225 joint linearly independent zone vectors ( all except two blue edges at @xmath59 ) and if we project @xmath2 along these @xmath225 vectors we will not decrease belt distance between @xmath1 and the blue facet . after this projection",
    "we will obtain a @xmath18-dimensional @xmath0-zonotope and its belt diameter is at most 2 so belt distance in @xmath2 between the red and the blue facets was at most 3 .",
    "now for @xmath220 and @xmath226 we will construct examples of graphs of symmetric @xmath0-zonotopes with no vertices that is red and blue leaves at the same time .",
    "if these graph will satisfy lemma [ trees ] then we will show that for every such @xmath3 there exist a symmetric @xmath3-dimensional @xmath0-zonotope with belt distance 3 between red and blue facets .    for odd dimension",
    "@xmath227 with @xmath228 the graph will have @xmath229 vertices , denote all vertices as shown on the following figure .",
    "then our graph will have following blue edges : @xmath230 for all @xmath69 from 1 to @xmath174 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 for all @xmath69 from 1 to @xmath234 it is easy to check conditions of lemma [ trees ] for this graph .        for even dimension",
    "@xmath235 with @xmath236 the graph will have @xmath237 vertices , denote all vertices as shown on the following figure",
    ". then our graph will have following blue edges : @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 for all @xmath69 from 2 to @xmath174 , @xmath242 for all @xmath69 from 1 to @xmath174 , @xmath243 it is easy to check conditions of lemma [ trees ] for this graph .",
    "the maximal belt diameter of @xmath3-dimensional @xmath0-zonotope is not greater than @xmath17 if @xmath211 and is not greater than @xmath18 if @xmath244 these bounds are sharp for any dimension .    for all dimensions except @xmath212",
    "this theorem immediately follows from lemma [ max ] and theorem [ pimax ] . for @xmath212",
    "we have an estimate @xmath18 for maximal belt diameter from lemma [ max ] and theorem [ pimax ] and we need to find an example of ( non - symmetric ) @xmath0-zonotope with belt diameter 3 . consider a zonotope with the graph on the following figure and two facets @xmath120 and @xmath121 of this zonotope determined by partitions @xmath245 and",
    "@xmath246 respectively .",
    "-dimensional @xmath0-zonotope with belt diameter 3.,height=113 ]    we need to show that there is no facet @xmath1 with partition into sets @xmath122 and @xmath49 of the vertex set of this graph that satisfy lemma [ pi - face ] for both facets @xmath120 and @xmath126 assume that such a face exists .",
    "then by lemma [ belt ] one of sets @xmath122 or @xmath49 must contain one of sets @xmath247 and @xmath122 or @xmath49 must contain @xmath134 or @xmath141 but all four intersections @xmath137 are nonempty and then one of sets , say @xmath122 , must contain one subset from @xmath247 and one from @xmath248    we have four possibilities :    * the set @xmath122 contains @xmath133 and @xmath249 then @xmath122 contains points @xmath250 due to lemma [ belt ] intersection @xmath251 must induce a connected subgraph and then @xmath252 on the other hand @xmath253 must induce a connected subgraph so @xmath254 and @xmath49 is empty and this impossible .",
    "* the set @xmath122 contains @xmath133 and @xmath141 then @xmath122 contains points @xmath255 due to lemma [ belt ] intersection @xmath253 must induce a connected subgraph and then @xmath256 on the other hand @xmath257 must induce a connected subgraph so @xmath258 and @xmath49 is empty and this impossible .",
    "* the set @xmath122 contains @xmath135 and @xmath249 then @xmath122 contains points @xmath259 due to lemma [ belt ] intersection @xmath260 must induce a connected subgraph and then @xmath261 on the other hand @xmath251 must induce a connected subgraph so @xmath262 and @xmath49 is empty and this impossible .",
    "* the set @xmath122 contains @xmath135 and @xmath141 then @xmath122 contains points @xmath263 due to lemma [ belt ] intersection @xmath260 must induce a connected subgraph and then @xmath264 on the other hand @xmath257 must induce a connected subgraph so @xmath265 and @xmath266 are in @xmath122 and @xmath49 is empty and this impossible .",
    "so all four possibilities are impossible and the theorem is proved .",
    "now we will establish connection between belt diameter of parallelohedron and its combinatorial diameter .",
    "the _ combinatorial diameter _ of polytope @xmath5 is the diameter of edge graph of its dual polytope , i.e. graph with vertices correspondent to facets of @xmath5 and with edges connecting facets adjacent by a face of codimension 2 .",
    "if @xmath3-dimensional parallelohedron @xmath5 has belt diameter @xmath30 then its combinatorial diameter is not greater than @xmath70 .",
    "consider two arbitrary facets of @xmath5 and sequence of at most @xmath30 belts @xmath267 that connects these facets .",
    "if we construct a path on the edge graph of dual polytope using only facets of these belts then on each belt we will need to do @xmath268 steps where @xmath268 is equal to @xmath269 or @xmath270 now we will show how to decrease the number of belts with two steps .",
    "if there are two consecutive belts @xmath271 and @xmath272 with @xmath273 ( this automatically means that both these belts consist of 6 facets ) then we replace path on each belt on the complementary half - belts consist of one step .",
    "also if we have two consecutive belts @xmath271 and @xmath272 with @xmath274 and @xmath275 then we can flip these numbers of steps using complementary half - belts of @xmath269 and at most @xmath17 steps .",
    "the illustration of these two operations is on the next figure , red segments illustrates the path on edges of the dual polytope .",
    "@xmath276 @xmath276    using these operations we can take two closest @xmath268 s that are equal to 2 and replace them by 1 s .",
    "so in the end we will get the same sequence of belts but with at most one belt with 2 steps on it , so for these two facets we constructed a path of length at most @xmath277    the combinatorial diameter of @xmath3-dimensional @xmath0-zonotope is at most @xmath18 if @xmath215 and at most @xmath219 if @xmath278 .",
