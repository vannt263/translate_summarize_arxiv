    "x - ray observations of accreting neutron stars and black holes necessarily probe regions close to the compact object .",
    "the long  held promise of these observations is that aspects of the compact object itself , and the innermost accretion flow , may be revealed .",
    "notable early attempts to realize this promise took several forms .",
    "for instance , many attempts were made to use the blackbody spectra of type - i x - ray bursts in accreting neutron star systems to infer the stellar radius ; however , derived radii were implausibly small , likely due to scattering effects ( see london , taam , & howard 1986 ) . in the case of black holes , careful efforts to measure the inner radius of the accretion disk ( see ,",
    "e.g. , makishima et al .  1986 ) were similarly complicated by various observational uncertainties such as mass and distance , and also by scattering effects ( shimura & takahara 1995 ; merloni , fabian , & ross 2000 ) .    at the most basic level , measurements of stellar or disk radii using blackbody or modified blackbody continua amount to counting photons under a curve to measure an absolute flux .",
    "this is extremely difficult ( though not impossible ) , and easily complicated by additional continuum components and detector flux calibration uncertainties . partially owing to difficulties associated with continuum spectroscopy , and partially owing to the detection of broad , possibly relativistic fe k emission lines in cygnus x-1 ( barr , white , & page 1985 ) and 4u",
    "1543@xmath1475 ( van der woerd , white , & kahn 1989 ; also see park et al .",
    "2004 ) , parallel efforts to measure fundamental parameters focused on line spectroscopy .",
    "theoretical line models for non - spinning ( schwarzschild ; @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ) black holes and maximal - spin ( kerr @xmath4 ; thorne et al .",
    "1974 ) black holes have been calculated for some time ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ; laor 1991 ) .",
    "self - consistent models for hard x - ray illumination of an accretion disk that could give rise to such emission lines also have a long history ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "these models predict that lines arising in the inner disk should have skewed , asymmetric shapes , including a strong blue wing that is enhanced by special relativistic beaming and a long red wing that arises through doppler shifts and gravitational red - shifts .",
    "line shapes are very difficult to discern at the resolution afforded by gas proportial counter spectrometers ( e.g. @xmath5 ) .",
    "confirmation of this line shape was first achieved in an _ asca _ observation of the seyfert-1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( tanaka et al .",
    "it was facilitated by the x - ray charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) aboard the mission , which delivered a resolution of @xmath6 in the fe k band .",
    "relativistic iron lines are merely the most prominent part of the broad - band response of an accretion disk to hard x - rays , known as the disk reflection spectrum ( see , e.g. , george & fabian 1991 ; magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ; dovciak , karas , & yaqoob 2004 ; ross & fabian 2005 ) .",
    "x - ray ccds and relativistic spectroscopy of black holes and neutron stars are thus intimately linked .",
    "the advanced ccd spectrometers aboard _",
    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ suzaku _ have confirmed relativistic lines in a number of seyfert-1 spectra ( for a review , see miller 2007 ) .",
    "just as importantly , the ability of these spectrometers to handle high flux levels has made it possible to clearly detect asymmetric lines in the spectra of stellar - mass black holes , and to reject the possibility that broad lines are actually a collection of narrow lines ( see , e.g. , miller et al .",
    "if the inner disk is assumed to be truncated at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , which is set by the spin of the black hole ( see bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ) , relativistic lines can be used to infer black hole spin parameters . in a number of stellar - mass black holes ,",
    "the lines observed are sufficiently broad that varying degrees of black hole spin may be required ( e.g. miller et al .  2002 , 2004 , 2008 ;",
    "reis et al .",
    "2009 ; hiemstra et al .",
    "2010 ; for a self - consistent analysis of eight systems , see miller et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "very recently , x - ray ccd spectroscopy of transient and persistent neutron star x - ray binaries has revealed skewed , asymmetric disk lines in these systems ( see , e.g. , bhattacharyya & strohmayer 2007 , cackett et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 , di salvo et al .",
    "2009 , da et al .",
    "2009 , da et al .  2010",
    "; for a self - consistent analysis of 10 systems , see cackett et al .  2010 . ) in these sources , relativistic disk lines can be exploited to constrain the radius of the star , since the stellar surface ( if nothing else ) must truncate the disk wherein the lines arise .",
    "the inner extent of the disk is also related to the alfven radius , and so can provide a constraint on stellar magnetic fields . in the case of the relativistic line observed in the millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.4@xmath13658 ( cackett et al .",
    "2009 , papitto et al.2009 ) , the resulting field limits are commensurate with those derived from x - ray timing ( cackett et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "new , parallel efforts to derive fundamental properties of compact objects and inner accretion flows have been fueled by new disk models .",
    "new prescriptions explicitly incorporate inner torque conditions , radiative transfer through the disk atmosphere , and even black hole spin parameters ( zimmerman et al .",
    "2005 , li et al .",
    "2005 , davis & hubeny 2006 ) . using these models , black hole spin parameters have been constrained in a number of systems ( see , e.g. , mcclintock et al.2006 , shafee et al .",
    "2006 ; also see zhang , cui , & chen 1997 ) . the improved low - energy range of x - ray ccd detectors ( often extending down to 0.3  kev ) relative to current gas detectors ( coverage below @xmath7  kev is not possible with _ rxte _ nor _ integral _ ) allows for improved measurements of the disk flux , and enables observers to separate disk emission from line - of - sight absorption in the interstellar medium ( though in many cases dispersive spectroscopy may be required for this purpose ; miller , reis , & cackett 2009 ) .",
    "thus , while the improved energy resolution of x - ray ccd spectrometers is not necessarily critical for continuum spectroscopy , their energy range and spectral resolution are beneficial .",
    "while measuring the width of lines is often easier than measuring an absolute flux , it still requires an accurate characterization of the underlying continuum flux , and an accurate knowledge of how the spectrometer reacts to high flux levels .",
    "the latter issue is typically unimportant for gas proportional counter spectrometers , but it can be important for x - ray ccd spectrometers . indeed , the reaction of x - ray ccds is important for both forms of relativistic spectroscopy of compact objects : an instrumental failure to accurately record the flux level is problematic for disk continua , and distortions to the continuum shape and energy response are problematic for line spectroscopy .",
    "photon pile - up occurs when two or more photons land within a detection cell within a single ccd frame time .",
    "this causes a degeneracy between detecting @xmath8 photons with energy @xmath9 and a single photon with energy of @xmath10 .",
    "thus when pile - up occurs , energy and flux information are lost .",
    "it has recently been suggested that ineffective pile - up mitigation could produce spurious results concerning black hole spin , neutron star radii , and the radial extent of accretion disks as a function of the mass accretion rate ( e.g. yamada et al .",
    "2009 ; done & diaz trigo 2010 , ng et al .",
    "advanced statistical descriptions of photon pile - up in x - ray ccd detectors have been developed ( davis 2001 ; also see ballet 1999 ) , and implemented into fitting packages such as xspec and isis .",
    "the davis et al .  ( 2001 ) model has been applied in a number of regimes to correct for photon pile - up distortions , including spectra from : isolated neutron stars ( e.g. van kerkwijk et al .",
    "2004 ) , ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( e.g. roberts et al .",
    "2004 ) , transient galactic black hole candidates ( e.g. jonker et al .  2004 ) , low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. heinke et al .",
    "2006 ) , and even agn ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "most notably , nowak et al .",
    "( 2008 ) employed the basic elements of the davis model to correct distortions to the _ chandra _ spectra of the black hole candidate 4u 1957@xmath1111 .",
    "inner disk parameters consistent with those derived using spectra from other missions , including _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ , were then recovered . a similar treatment of _ chandra _ spectra of cygnus x-1 by hanke et al .",
    "( 2009 ) was able to bring different spectra into close agreement .    with the aim of developing a rigorous understanding of how pile - up may affect relativistic spectroscopy",
    ", we have conducted extensive simulations based on a range of assumed input spectra , flux levels , and detector properties .",
    "this effort is timely as x - ray ccd spectrometers will be the standard in the field for the foreseeable future , at least for moderate resolution spectroscopy of bright targets . in the following sections",
    ", we briefly review the operation of x - ray ccd detectors , review the pile - up model used in our simulations , describe our simulations and results , and discuss the impacts of our findings .",
    "the primary goal of this analysis is not to understand how to best avoid photon pile - up , though the results offer some insights on this point .",
    "rather , the goal of this exercise is to understand the nature and magnitude of distortions to relativistic disk parameters when photon pile - up is present but unknown to an observer , poorly quantified , or difficult to mitigate in a rigorous manner . in a subset of our simulated spectra , then , photon pile - up is quite severe . when faced with similar real data , an observer would likely be motivated to extract an annulus or to otherwise at least partially mitigate the effects of pile - up .",
    "at the most basic level , a ccd is an array of coupled capacitors .",
    "when an incident photon interacts in the semiconductor substrate , electrons are liberated .",
    "the charge is collected and stored in pixels , and it can be transfered to neighboring pixels  and eventually into an amplifier and read - out system  by virtue of the coupling .    in many respects ,",
    "the operation of x - ray ccds is similar to that of optical ccds .",
    "one important difference is that optical photons only liberate a small number of electrons ( typically zero or one ) in an interaction .",
    "x - ray photons have much more energy , of course , and liberate many electrons . indeed , the number of electrons liberated in an interaction is proportional to the energy of the incident x - ray .",
    "this fact means that x - ray ccds are not merely imaging instruments , but medium - resolution spectrometers as well .",
    "the gas proportional counters aboard _",
    "rxte _ have an energy resolution of @xmath12 ; current x - ray ccds ( e.g. _ chandra_/acis ) achieve an energy resolution of @xmath13 at 5.9 kev .",
    "most x - ray ccds cover the 0.310.0  kev band .",
    "these limits are set by a combination of factors , including the efficiency of capturing and clocking charge clouds generated by low energy x - rays ( this is partially set by the electrodes ) , the depletion layer thickness , the ability of current x - ray mirrors to focus hard x - rays , and the ability of the instrument to distinguish hard x - rays from non - x - ray events .",
    "the detailed performance characteristics of a given x - ray ccd depend on several variables , including the nature of the device structure ( n- or p- substrate , mos or pn junction ) ; whether charge is stored and read - out close to the x - ray - illuminated face of the ccd , or far from the illuminated face ; the temperature at which the ccd is being operated ( this affects dark currents and noise ) , and a number of more subtle factors .",
    "photons are detected and elementary screening of desirable ( e.g. x - ray ) versus undesirable ( e.g. cosmic ray ) events is achieved in part by assigning event `` grades '' .",
    "interactions are characterized using event `` boxes '' , which are usually 3x3 cells of pixels .",
    "the pattern of pulseheights that are consistent with photon interactions can be defined and differentiated from `` hot '' pixel and cosmic ray patterns .",
    "efficient spectroscopy with an x - ray ccd depends on each event box recording zero or one photons per ccd frame time .",
    "when the x - ray flux incident on a ccd is too high , multiple photons can be read as a single high energy photon ( see above ) .",
    "the resulting flux is thus registered as falsely low , and the resulting spectrum as falsely hard .",
    "grade migration provides a potential means of recognizing and diagnosing the degree of photon pile - up suffered in a given observation . when pile - up is important , charge patterns consistent with single photon interactions are reduced and patterns consistent with higher energy photon interactions or multiple photon interactions are increased .",
    "various strategies can be deployed to deliver nominal spectroscopic response even at high x - ray flux levels .",
    "the nominal ccd frame time can be greatly reduced , thus lowering the probability of two photons registering in a given event box .",
    "this often comes at the expense of imaging information , observing efficiency , or both .",
    "over - sampling a broad telescope psf with a high number of event boxes is another viable means of limiting the number of photons that may land in a given event box .",
    "the expense of a broad psf is , of course , the loss of fine image quality .",
    "observers can try to further prevent or limit photon pile - up by only extracting events from the wings of the psf in annuli , by placing a source off of the optical axis of the telescope to blur its flux over more pixels , or by adopting a rigid grade selection that permits only single - photon events . in practice , however , some spectra obtained with x - ray ccds will suffer from photon pile - up .",
    "pile - up is a complex but well - understood statistical process : at a given flux level , a given event box has a fixed probability of getting 0 , 1 , or n photons .",
    "the probability of a given event grade for each outcome is also well - determined . if the input spectrum is known , or if it can be estimated , the distribution of `` good '' event grades ( those likely to originate from actual x - ray photons ) can be used to infer the extent and severity of photon pile - up . on this basis ,",
    "davis ( 2001 ) has developed a model of photon pile - up .",
    "the model not only accounts for the energy shifts due to photon pile - up , but also for flux decrements due to grade migration .",
    "the crux of the davis model is a new integral equation for the number of counts detected from a point source . the conventional equation for the number of counts detected in an x - ray spectrometer is linear , and discussed in detail in gorenstein , gursky , & garmire ( 1968 ) .",
    "however , pile - up is a nonlinear process , and requires a more advanced treatment .",
    "davis ( 2001 ) presents an alternative integral equation that accurately characterizes the counts observed in the presence of photon pile - up .",
    "a fundamental assumption of the pile - up model is that a charge cloud in the ccd arising from n photons can be treated as the linear superposition of n individual charge clouds .",
    "since the drift time for charge clouds in a ccd is typically much less than a microsecond , which is much smaller than typical readout times , and since a ccd amplifier is highly linear at x - ray signal levels , this assumption is valid for all of the ccd modes that will be considered in this work .    in practice ,",
    "the chief uncertainty in correcting for pile - up using this model is that the details of the input spectrum are usually not known a priori .",
    "exceptions might include instances where different missions are simultaneously observing the same source , or an instance wherein a given ccd spectrometer alternates between different operational modes .",
    "_ this uncertainty does not enter into our analysis .",
    "_ simulating the effects of photon pile - up by convolving different input spectra with the pile - up model of davis ( 2001 ) is a well - controlled experiment  the nature of the input spectrum is known perfectly .",
    "the results of this procedure can be thought of as characterizing the nature and severity of systematic errors on relativistic disk parameters arising due to photon pile - up .",
    "it is worth noting that although the pile - up model was developed for _ chandra _ , it is easily applicable to other missions .",
    "the crucial modification in describing pile - up in other ccd spectrometers is to accurately account for the fraction of the telesope point spread function ( psf ) that is enclosed in each event box .",
    "this can differ considerably from mission to mission . whereas a single event box captures a high fraction of _ chandra s _ psf , a single event box captures a very small fraction of _ suzaku s _ psf . in the latter case , to evaluate pile - up in a reasonable extraction region ,",
    "many event boxes must be considered jointly .    as implemented in the xspec spectral fitting package ( arnaud & dorman 2000 ) , the davis pile - up model has six parameters : the ccd frame time , the maximum number of photons to pile - up , the grade correction for a single photon , the grade morphing parameter ( the grade migration function is a probability assumed to be proportional to @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the grade morphing parameter and @xmath17 is the number of piled photons ) , the psf fraction considered , and the number of event regions .",
    "this description of grade migration is based on the premise that photon arrival times in a given cell obey poission statistics .",
    "it correctly captures the fact that the probability of recording an unwanted event grade increases with the number of piled photons .",
    "to understand the specific effects of photon pile - up on disk continua and reflection parameters , we created a large number ( 325 ) of simulated spectra using the davis pile - up model .",
    "realistic , multi - component spectral forms based on published results were employed to make the simulations as realistic as possible .",
    "the spectra were generated using the `` fakeit '' command in xspec version 12 .",
    "for simplicity , and because this exercise is necessarily concerned with bright sources , no backgrounds were used in making the source spectra . in all cases , an exposure time of 100,000 seconds was used when creating simulated spectra .",
    "this exposure is longer than a typical observation , but allows for excellent photon statistics .    in all of the simulations made in this work",
    ", default values were assumed for the maximum number of photons to pile - up ( 5 ) and the grade correction for a single photon ( 1 ) .",
    "the frame time , psf fraction , and number of event boxes were set according to the telescope and ccd combination used in each simulation . with these parameters fixed",
    ", the grade morphing parameter @xmath16 effectively sets the severity of photon pile - up ( when the incident source flux in each event box leads to pile - up ) .",
    "as implemented in xspec , the pile - up model is a convolution model .",
    "input spectra were convolved with the pile - up kernel to produce a resultant spectrum that is distorted by photon pile - up effects . in practice , for a given detector and mode ,",
    "the degree of pile - up is set by the incident flux level . in our simulations , the degree of photon pile - up was controlled by adjusting the grade morphing parameter @xmath16 .",
    "steps of 0.1 were used for @xmath18 , and steps of 0.04 were used for @xmath19 .",
    "the step size was reduced for high values of @xmath16 in order to provide better resolution when pile - up typically starts to introduce strong distortions . for each combination of input spectrum and detector mode ,",
    "then , 13 simulated spectra were generated .",
    "x - ray binaries display a wide variety of phenomena . periods of correlated multi - wavelength behaviors can be classified into `` states '' that may correspond to distinct changes in the accetion flow ( for a review , see , e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; also see belloni et al .",

    "table 1 lists values for all of the input spectra considered in this work .",
    "the paragraphs below offer some context and motivation for why certain models and values were used to generate the spectra .    _ the very high state _ : this state can be extremely bright , and it has seldom been observed using ccd spectrometers .",

    "the `` intermediate '' state is similar to the `` very high '' state in terms of its spectral form ( both thermal disk and non - thermal power - law - like emission are important ) , but typically has a lower flux .",
    "the effects of photon pile - up in this state are likely to be similar to the effects on very high state spectra at low values of the grade migration parameter @xmath16 .",

    "we used the spectral continuum parameters reported by cackett et al .",

    "for instance , it does not include a zero - torque condition at the inner edge , whereas including this condition can reduce implied radii by a factor of @xmath352 ( zimmerman et al .",
    "moreover , a number of new disk models have been developed in which black hole spin is an explicit parameter ( davis & hubeny 2006 ) .",

    "whereas new models can have as many as 10 free parameters , the `` diskbb '' model is able to accurately characterize the thermal continuum with only two ( temperature and flux normalization ) . owing to its simplicity and prior application to many neutron star and black hole spectra over numerous years and x - ray missions , then",

    "the results of the numerous simulations and fitting exercises detailed above suggest that severe photon pile - up affects relativistic disk spectra in clear and predictable ways :    redistributing the low energy continuum to the high energy portion of the spectrum causes relativistic emission lines to become _ falsely narrow _ , giving a _ falsely high _",
    "value for the inner disk radius . in turn",
    ", this means that estimates of black holes spin parameters based on the inner disk radius would be _ falsely low_. in spectra where pile - up may be important and the success of mitigation is uncertain , emission lines give _ upper limits _ on the radius of the accretion disk , and _ lower limits _ on the value of the black hole spin parameter .",
    "the same trends are also observed in the case of neutron stars , both when relativistic and simple narrow gaussian line functions are assumed .",
    "redistributing the low energy continuum to the high energy portion of the spectrum has exactly the opposite impact on disk continua .",

    "therefore , when pile - up may be important , and/or when efforts to mitigate pile - up may not have been entirely successful , radii inferred from continuum fits are _ lower limits _ and inferred spin parameters are _ upper limits_.    when two diagnostics are skewed in the same sense , it is difficult to detect a bias , and a potential check on derived quantities is lost .",
    "the results of the simple exercise undertaken in this paper are therefore fortuitous : photon pile - up distorts relativistic disk lines and the disk continuum in _ opposing _ ways .",
    "fitting both lines and the disk continuum with relativistic spectral models and either checking that the radii agree , or explicitly requiring agreement in the fit ( see miller et al .",
    "2009 ) , will help to derive results that are robust against pile - up distortions .",
    "this procedure may be more difficult in the case of neutron stars , however , because the disk continuum is typically less distinct in neutron star spectra .",

    "this fact fueled the requirement of minimum sensitivity thresholds in recent surveys of relativistic lines in seyfert agn ( see nandra et al .",
    "recent work on neutron star spectra makes the necessity of sensitive spectra even more clear .",

    "in contrast , when observed using `` burst '' mode , the line is visible down to 5  kev ( or lower ) relative to a simple continuum , a radius of less than @xmath60 is required , and a reflection fraction of @xmath61 is measured ( martocchia et al .",

    "the line is also broad , and consistent with the isco ; see blum et al .",
    "these results square with a central result of the simulations presented in this paper : photon pile - up acts to make relativistic lines appear to be falsely narrow .",
    "though an investigation is beyond the scope of this paper , it should be noted that efforts to mitigate pile - up can also distort spectra .",
    "the psf of an x - ray telescope is energy - dependent .",
    "extracting events in annuli may avoid the piled - up core of a given psf , but the spectrum is then derived from a portion of the psf that is not calibrated as well as the core .",
    "moreover , depending on the psf , annular regions may only extract a vanishing fraction of the incident photon flux , complicating the detection of weak spectral lines .",
    "relativistic disk lines are often 1020% features above the continuum ; extracting spectra from regions of the psf from which the energy and flux calibration are not known to much better than 10% could easily make it difficult to recover the details of a given line profile .",
    "depending on how much flux is excluded in the annulus , limited photon statistics will also serve to complicate the detection of line asymmetry .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that our results depend on a specific combination of mirror technology and detector technology .",
    "presently , ccd spectrometers sit at the focus of gold foil or gold - coated mirors ; this partially accounts for an overall telescope efficiency curve that is highest below 2 kev .",
    "new mirror technology , such as si pore optics ( e.g. beijersbergen , m. , et al . , 2004 ) , may produce different ccd photon pile - up effects , and distortions to disk continua and disk lines may not longer skew in the opposite sense .",
    "extensive simulations of photon pile - up for a number of spectral forms and detector parameters suggest that severe pile - up can distort spectroscopic signatures of the inner accretion disk , in largely predictable ways .",
    "the results of our work can be summarized as follows : + @xmath62 the degree of photon pile - up in a spectrum depends on the input flux level from a source and the effective area of the telesecope , but it is also depends on the number of event boxes tiling the psf and the frame time of the ccd .",
    "@xmath62 tiling the psf with many event boxes and short frame times are two independent means of reducing photon pile - up .",
    "however , when short frame times are achieved by changing the size of an event box and under - sampling the psf , pile - up mitigation is partially compromised .",
    "@xmath62 flux redistribution due to photon pile - up causes emission lines  whether relativistic or symmetric and intrinsically narrow  to be observed as falsely narrow .",
    "measured inner disk radii are then falsely large , and inferred black hole spin parameters are falsely low .",
    "relevent observed spectra , though small in number , support this finding .",
    "@xmath62 grade migration due to photon pile - up causes the low energy spectrum  principally the disk component  to have a falsely low flux .",
