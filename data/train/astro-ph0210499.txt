    "the focus of extrasolar planet research has broadened to now include the characterization of their physical properties , as shown by the recent sodium detection in the atmosphere of hd  209458  b ( charbonneau et al . 2002 ) . atmospheric circulation",
    "is expected to play a key role in determining a number of observational characteristics of egps , including their albedo and transmission spectrum ( see , e.g. , seager & sasselov 1998 , 2000 ; sudarsky et al .",
    "2000 ; brown 2001 ) .",
    "this is especially true for close - in egps , which are thought to be tidally - locked to their parent star and irradiated on one side only : circulation will be essential in redistributing heat from the day to the night side on these planets , thus determining to a large extent how they will appear to the distant observer ( cho et al .",
    "2002a , b ; showman & guillot 2002 ) .",
    "recently , we have presented a set of detailed shallow - water numerical simulations of the atmospheric flow on hd  209458  b ( cho et al .",
    "2002a , b ) , currently the only egp with known mass and radius from the transit light curves and radial velocity measurements ( charbonneau et al . 2000 ; henry et al . 2000 ; mazeh et al .",
    "2000 ; jha et al .",
    "2000 ; brown et al .",
    "these simulations suggest that , contrary to the simple day / night ( hot / cold ) picture , the circulation on this planet is characterized by two moving circumpolar vortices and a small number of latitudinal bands / jets",
    ". the vortices act as dynamically distinct thermal spots whose motion around the poles generates variability as seen by an observer interested in quantities integrated over the planetary disk ( or circumference ) .",
    "it is possible to determine the general features of the circulation pattern expected within the framework of shallow - water dynamics by specifying the two dimensionless numbers  rossby ( @xmath1 ) and burger ( @xmath2 )  for the atmospheric flow . in this _ letter _ , we estimate a range of likely @xmath1 and @xmath2 values for known close - in egps and conclude that their atmospheric circulation pattern should be qualitatively similar to that of hd  209458  b. in  2 , we recall how the atmospheric flow pattern can be characterized by the knowledge of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in  3 , we describe the sample of close - in egps selected for our study and how we estimate likely values for various global planetary parameters entering into the definition of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "finally , our results and conclusions are presented in  4 .",
    "shallow - water equations describe the motion of a thin , homogeneous layer of hydrostatically - balanced , inviscid fluid with a free surface , in motion around a rotating planet ( pedlosky 1987 , holton 1992 ) .",
    "the fluid is subject to gravitational and coriolis forces and obeys the following equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the horizontal velocity , @xmath9 is the thickness of the modeled layer , @xmath10 is the coriolis parameter , @xmath11 is the rotation rate of the planet , @xmath12 is the latitude , @xmath13 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath14 is the unit vector normal to the surface of the planet . in dimensionless form ,",
    "shallow - water equations become functions only of the rossby ( @xmath1 ) and burger ( @xmath2 ) numbers : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are characteristic velocity , length and layer thickness scales , respectively ; @xmath19 is the rossby deformation radius .",
    "note that @xmath20 at mid - latitudes and that the planetary radius , @xmath21 , is the relevant length scale when discussing the large - scale atmospheric circulation .",
    "the rossby number measures the importance of rotation on the flow , while the burger number measures the stratification of the atmosphere via the brunt - visl frequency ( holton 1992 ) .    the atmospheric structure in bands of gaseous giant planets in our solar system",
    "is well described as emerging from freely - evolving shallow - water turbulence on the sphere ( cho & polvani 1996b ) .",
    "turbulence in a thin atmospheric layer is quasi-2d in nature .",
    "contrary to the forward turbulent energy cascade observed in 3d geometry , 2d turbulence is characterized by an inverse energy cascade ( transfer from small to large scales ) and a forward cascade of enstrophy , where @xmath22 is the flow vorticity . ] down to small scales , where it is dissipated by viscous processes .",
    "qualitatively , the inverse cascade is associated with the growth of vortices through continuous mergers .",
    "turbulence in a thin atmospheric layer is also strongly constrained by the combined effect of spherical geometry and rotation ( the `` @xmath23effect '' ) .",
    "while the force balance is everywhere the same along a latitude circle , it changes with latitude because of the dependence of the coriolis term with @xmath12 .",
    "this anisotropy , as measured by the parameter @xmath24 ( the latitudinal gradient of @xmath25 ) , is strongest at the equator , where @xmath26 is maximum .. while fluid motions are free to grow to the largest available scale in the longitudinal direction , their growth is limited in the latitudinal direction by the characteristic rhines scale , @xmath27 ( rhines 1975 ) .",
    "this anisotropic growth is a likely origin of the banded structure on gaseous giant planets in our solar system ; the number of bands expected for a given planet is roughly @xmath28 .",
    "cho & polvani ( 1996a ) presented an extensive numerical study of freely - evolving shallow - water turbulence .",
    "they explored the entire parameter space of the equations , as determined by the two dimensionless numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they showed that the anisotropy due to the @xmath23effect on a rotating sphere is necessary but not sufficient to produce a long - lasting banded structure .",
    "the rossby deformation radius , @xmath19 , must also be @xmath29 for the banded structure to be stable .",
    "this small value of @xmath19 , which acts as a limiting scale for vortex interactions , prevents the formation ( via successive mergers ) of large - scale structures such as circumpolar vortices .",
    "cho et al . ( 2002b ) presented a generalization of the results of cho & polvani in the case when the planet is subject to day - side hemispheric heating , as expected for close - in egps .",
    "day - side heating was prescribed in the adiabatic limit by forcing the fluid to be permanently thicker on that side , while keeping the average thickness constant .",
    "extensive exploration of the parameter space of the forced model showed that previous shallow - water dynamics results were recovered even in the presence of this extra forcing ( i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath19 remain the relevant scales determining the number of bands and the formation of polar vortices ) .",
    "these results can be recast in terms of the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the atmospheric flow . by setting @xmath31 , @xmath20 and @xmath32 ( mid - latitudes ) , we see that the number of bands / jets expected is @xmath33 and that the presence of circumpolar vortices is expected for @xmath34 . thus ,",
    "if the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for other close - in egps can be estimated , one can get an idea of the type of large - scale atmospheric circulation expected on these planets in the stable , radiative region . in our estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", we will set @xmath35 , which is the global velocity scale of the atmospheric flow and is only known for the solar system giants ( table  [ tab : one ] ) ,    an important parameter entering the definition of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the planetary rotation rate , @xmath11 . while the value of @xmath11 is generally unknown for egps , a number of close - in egps have the advantage of being probably tidally - synchronized to their parent star , so that their rotation rate has effectively been measured via the orbital period ( @xmath36 for circular orbits ) . as we show below , the knowledge of @xmath11 for this sample of close - in egps restricts the range of possible values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 to a small enough region of the parameter space that their atmospheric circulation pattern can be inferred .",
    "since tidal synchronization occurs faster than orbital circularization , it is possible that some close - in egps with substantial eccentricities are nonetheless ( pseudo-)synchronized ( i.e. synchronized at the periastron orbital frequency ) .",
    "the shallow - water results described in  2 were established only in the limit of negligible eccentricity , however .",
    "hence , we must restrict our sample to planets with small eccentricities .",
    ", by analogy with the small eccentricities of solar system giants to which `` zero - eccentricity '' shallow - water models have been applied with success ( cho & polvani 1996b ; cho et al .",
    "] table  [ tab : one ] lists all the egps selected for our study , plus the four solar system giants .",
    "parameters for the egps were collected from the extrasolar planet almanac and encyclopedia .",
    "low - eccentricity egps were divided into two groups , based on their orbital distance to the parent star . in the first group ,",
    "egps with semi - major axes @xmath37  au are most likely tidally - synchronized since all known egps with such small values of @xmath38 are also circularized .",
    "the tidal synchronization status of the more distant planets ( in the second group ) is less clear because several eccentric egps with distances of closest approach as small as @xmath39  au are also known .",
    "it is thus not clear why some egps with periastron distances larger than this value would be tidally - circularized while others would not .",
    "we note , however , that for values of the tidal parameter @xmath40 not too different from that of jupiter ( @xmath41 ) , egps in this second group are also expected to be synchronized .",
    "we will assume it is indeed the case in our calculations .",
    "radial velocity surveys only measure @xmath42 , which is a lower limit to the planet s mass , @xmath43 , given the unknown orbital inclination , @xmath44 . for randomly oriented systems , the distribution of @xmath45 is uniform .",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath46 for our fiducial estimate of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and we allow @xmath47 to vary from @xmath48 to @xmath49 when estimating the range of likely values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 . , some egps in table  [ tab : one ] have @xmath50 and are thus brown dwarfs .",
    "we expect shallow - water results to be applicable even in that limit . ]    for a given mass , @xmath43 , the radius of an isolated planet is estimated from the mass  radius relation for sub - stellar objects of chabrier & baraffe ( 2000 ) , supplemented at the low mass end by a constant density law that empirically fits values for the solar system giants . to account for the slower cooling under strong stellar irradiation , we also allow the radius to be up to @xmath51 larger than the value for an isolated planet , in agreement with published cooling egp models ( burrows et al .",
    "2000 ; guillot & showman 2002 ) .",
    "our results depend only weakly on the planetary radius , as long as @xmath52 ( as expected for all masses of interest ) .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is derived as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the gravitational constant .",
    "for the mean layer thickness , @xmath18 , we adopt the atmospheric pressure scale - height , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the perfect gas constant .",
    "the global radiative equilibrium temperature of the planet is @xmath57 , which is a function of the parent star luminosity ( @xmath58 ) , the planet s semi - major axis @xmath38 , and bond albedo @xmath59 .",
    "we adopt @xmath60 for all our numerical estimates ; our results only weakly depend on the value of @xmath59 unless it approaches unity .",
    "the stellar luminosity is derived from the mass through the simple mass - luminosity relation @xmath61 .",
    "the last two parameters needed to determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the planetary rotation rate @xmath11 and the global kinetic energy scale @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that @xmath63 ( as determined by radial velocity surveys ) in all cases .",
    "we allow @xmath62 to vary from @xmath64  m  s@xmath65 , the smallest observed value for giant planets in the solar system ( jupiter ) , to @xmath66  m  s@xmath65 , a rather large value for which the typical wind speeds in the atmosphere of hot , close - in egps approaches the sound speed .",
    "a value @xmath67  m  s@xmath65 is adopted for our fiducial estimate of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "estimated values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given in table  [ tab : one ] for solar system giants and close - in egps .",
    "the values listed for close - in egps correspond to the range of min./max .",
    "values found given the various assumptions detailed in  3 .",
    "fiducial estimates are also reported in figure  [ fig : one ] , where solid dots correspond to group 1 egps ( safe tidal synchronization assumption ) and open circles to group 2 egps ( tidal synchronization assumption less safe ) .",
    "hd  209458  b is indicated as a star .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : one ] that close - in egps , as a group , occupy a different region of the @xmath1@xmath2 parameter space than solar system giants . in particular , they systematically have a burger number @xmath68 ( even when accounting for the large range of allowed values ; table  [ tab : one ] ) , which indicates that the presence of circumpolar vortices is expected in the radiative region of close - in egps within the framework of shallow - water dynamics .",
    "the larger values of @xmath1 also indicate that generally few bands / jets are expected on these planets ( the uncertainty on @xmath62 strongly affects this number ; see table  [ tab : one ] ) , thus allowing the formation of larger `` great spots '' ( which could also contribute to the variability ; cho et al .",
    "2002b ) . the near alignment of all the points representing close - in egps in figure  [ fig : one ] shows that the dominant parameter determining their position in this diagram is their rotation rate ( @xmath69 ; @xmath70 ) .",
    "the small values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for solar system giants reflect their relatively fast rotation rates .    although we argued in favor of variable atmospheric signatures for close - in egps , it is important to note that models do not yet quantitatively predict how much variability is expected . in cho",
    "et al . ( 2002a , b ) , we emphasized that the combination of @xmath62 ( unknown ) and the amplitude of day - night heating ( parametrized in adiabatic simulations ) determines the contrast of the thermal spots associated with circumpolar vortices . in the future ,",
    "diabatic shallow - water models will allow a self - consistent determination of the day - night forcing .",
    "more sophisticated models , combined with detailed radiative transfer and chemistry descriptions ( seager & sasselov 1998 ; 2000 ; seager et al .",
    "2000 ) , will allow us to make quantitative predictions regarding the level of variability expected for various atmospheric signatures .",
