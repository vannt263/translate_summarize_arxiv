    "the functioning of living cells depends critically on molecular transport through various transport channels @xcite .",
    "many of them function without a direct input of metabolic energy and without a movable gate that would involve transitions from an open to a closed state during transport",
    ". nevertheless , such channels are selective , efficient and fast .",
    "examples include porins , nuclear pore complex and others @xcite .",
    "the functioning of such channels has served as an inspiration for the creation of artificial biosensors and nano - molecular filters @xcite that promise to play an ever increasing role in nano - technological and nano - medical applications , such as single - mismatch dna detection @xcite , enantiomer separation @xcite , pathogen detection @xcite and design of antibiotic drugs optimized for penetrating the cell @xcite .",
    "such man - made channels also serve as testbeds for examining models of biological transport @xcite .",
    "biological and artificial transport channels , such as those mentioned above , usually contain a passageway through which the molecules translocate by diffusion . from recent experimental and theoretical work",
    ", it has become increasingly clear that in many cases the transport selectivity of such channels is not dictated merely by molecule size , but is controlled by transient binding of the transported molecules inside the passageway @xcite . the crucial insight into understanding",
    "the transport selectivity of such channels is that even in the absence of any physical barrier for the entrance to the channel , the probability of a particle to translocate through it is low ( of an order of the aspect ratio of the channel ) @xcite .",
    "transient trapping ( due to binding ) inside the channel overcomes this dimensionality barrier @xcite .",
    "however , if the molecules are trapped in the channel for too long , the channel becomes crowded and transport is diminished .",
    "the interplay of these two effects provides a basis for selective transport , whereby only the molecules that are trapped in the channel for an optimal time transit through the channel with a high flux @xcite .",
    "related mechanisms have been known in the context of carrier - assisted membrane transport as facilitated diffusion @xcite .",
    "theoretical models that include the transient trapping combined with the effects of confinement @xcite provide a good explanation of the behavior of the mean flux through nano - channels and show a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , from a biological perspective , transport of a single molecule can constitute a significant signalling effect @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to understand the transport through such channels on the single molecule level .",
    "advances in fluorescent microscopy and other methods allow one to follow the transport of individual molecules through a channel @xcite .",
    "single molecule tracking experiments provide a wealth of information about the transport mechanisms , which is not accessible from the measurements of the bulk flux through the channel .",
    "the kinetics of transport of a single particle through the channel in the absence of other particles is well understood @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the effects of crowding of the particles inside the channel on the transport times of individual particles in the experimentally relevant regime when a non - equilibrium steady state flux passes through the channel .",
    "here , we briefly review the kinetics of a single particle passing through the channel in order to explain the methods employed herein .",
    "the channel is represented as a sequence of sites @xmath0 .",
    "inside , the particle performs diffusion - like random walk starting at the entrance site @xmath1 and hopping between the internal sites @xmath2 at an average rate @xmath3 ( for simplicity , we assume that the channel is uniform ) . the particle can leave the channel from the terminal sites @xmath1 and @xmath4 with an average rate @xmath5 .",
    "transient trapping in the channel is described by choosing @xmath6 .",
    "this hopping process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic - prl ]     between which the particles can hop with rate @xmath3 .",
    "the rate of hopping out of the channel from its ends is @xmath5 . in the single particle case ,",
    "a particle starts at site @xmath1 and hops inside the channel until it exits from either end . in the multi - particle case ,",
    "the particles enter at site @xmath1 with an average rate @xmath7 , if its occupancy is less than the maximal allowed .",
    "the line shows the steady state concentration profile . ]    at any time @xmath8 , the position of the particle in the channel is described by the vector of probabilities @xmath9 to be at a particular site @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "we also define the vector @xmath12 as a vector with the @xmath13 element equal to @xmath1 and all other elements equal to @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the scalar product of the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . the master equation for the probability vector , describing the hopping through and out of the channel ends ,",
    "can be written as ( see the appendix for details ) @xmath19 the formal solution of the equation ( [ equation - for - p-1-prl ] ) can be written as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the initial condition @xcite ; for a particle starting at site @xmath1 , @xmath22 .",
    "the instantaneous probability flux to the right out of the channel is @xmath23 , and the probability that the particle had exited the channel from the right side by time @xmath8 is @xmath24 @xcite .    the total probability to exit to the right @xmath25 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "after some algebra ( see the appendix for details ) , equation ( [ equation - pr - single - prl ] ) gives for the total probability to exit from the channel on the right ( the translocation probability ) : @xmath28 , in accord with previous works @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath29 increases as @xmath5 diminishes .",
    "that is , trapping of the particle in the channel increases the translocation probability @xcite .",
    "we now calculate the directional mean exit times .",
    "the probability distribution of the exit times to the right @xmath30 is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , the mean time to exit the right is @xmath32 similarly , the mean first passage time to the left is @xmath33 the mean time to exit from _ any _ of the ends is @xmath34 using the equations above , we obtain explicit expressions for the mean times : @xmath35 in agreement with previous results obtained in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "note that the mean trapping time @xmath36 is _ linearly _ proportional to the channel length @xmath4 .",
    "surprisingly , the mean time for the particle to exit to the left @xmath37 also scales like @xmath4 for @xmath38 , due to the possibility of large excursions into the channel before it returns to the left end .",
    "by contrast , the mean exit time to the right has two distinct regimes . for short channels , or strong trapping ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 , while for long channels , or weak trapping , ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 ( see also fig .",
    "3 ) . physically , for strong trapping , the bottleneck for the exit to the right is the release from the channel end , while for long channels and weak trapping the exit time is dominated by the time it takes to diffuse through the channel from left to right .",
    "when a finite flux @xmath7 impinges onto the channel entrance , at any moment there can be many particles in the channel that might interfere with each other s passage and prevent the entrance of new ones .",
    "the particles in the channel obey the same kinetics as the single particles , with a condition that a site can contain up to a maximal number of particles @xmath43 .",
    "following @xcite , the system can be described in terms in terms of site occupancies @xmath44 . for constant @xmath7 ,",
    "a non - equilibrium steady state is established . the steady state profile of a uniform channel",
    "can be solved exactly : @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the main results of this paper - how does the crowding , when many particles are present in the channel , affect the transport times of individual particles within the non - equilibrium steady - state flux . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no exact analytical solution exists in this case .",
    "the transport of an individual particle can be viewed as occurring on the background of the steady state density profile @xmath46 . in the mean field approximation , the probability @xmath9 of a particle to be present at a given site is described by the following equations @xcite : @xmath47 with the appropriate boundary conditions ( see the appendix for details ) . using matrix notations : @xmath48 explicit matrix elements of @xmath49 are given in the appendix .",
    "as in the single - particle case above , the linear equations ( [ kinetics_with_exclusion - ss - prl],[equation - for - n-1-ss - prl ] ) can be solved analytically .    to test the feasibility of the mean field approximation , we compared the probability of a particle to exit to the right , computed using the exact solution for the steady state density with the mean field result ( see below ) . first , the average exit flux to the right is @xmath50 , which yields for the probability of an individual particle within this steady state flux to exit to the right @xcite : @xmath51 on the other hand , from the mean field approximation of eq .",
    "( [ kinetics_with_exclusion - ss - prl ] ) @xmath52 ( see eq .",
    "( [ equation - pr - single - prl ] ) ) . using the expressions for @xmath53 , after some algebra we get the same result as the exact expression , eq.([p - exit - ss - prl ] ) .",
    "thus , the mean field approximation yields an exact result : the probability of an individual particle to exit to the right is not affected by crowding and is the same as in the single - particle case ( at least for uniform channels ) @xcite . the directional mean exit times can be calculated by repeating the same algebra as for the case of a single particle , but with @xmath54 instead of @xmath55 .",
    "we find that the mean trapping time is @xmath56 - surprisingly , like the translocation probability , the mean trapping time is also not affected by the crowding . by contrast , the directional times to exit to the right and to the left , @xmath57 respectively , do change due to inter - particle interactions , compared to the single particle case .",
    "after some algebra ( see the appendix for details ) , one gets for the mean time to exit to the left :    @xmath58-\\frac{nm } { j^2 p_{\\leftarrow } } \\left[m r_o+jp_{\\leftarrow}+\\frac{j}{2}\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 ; @xmath60 is a @xmath61-function .",
    "the mean exit time to the right can be obtained in a similar fashion , using equation  ( [ at ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the exit times on the impinging flux @xmath7 is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . unlike the exit probabilities , crowding increases the mean time to exit to the right @xmath62 , and decreases the mean time to exit to the left @xmath37 .",
    "interestingly , however , the qualitative dependence on the channel length @xmath4 is similar to the single - particle case ( j=0 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "importantly , the transport times remain finite even in the fully jammed regime ( @xmath63 ) , when the flux through the channel saturates to its maximal value . in particular , the mean time to exit to the right tends to @xmath64 , while the mean time to exit to the left tends to @xmath65 ( see the appendix for details ) .",

    "the dependence on @xmath4 is qualitatively similar to the single particle case - see text .",
    "the inset shows the transition between small @xmath4 ( linear dependence ) and large @xmath4 ( quadratic dependence ) regimes ; logarithmic scale ; @xmath68 , @xmath72 , @xmath74 . ]    in order to corroborate the results of the mean field approximation and to investigate the limits of its validity , we performed computer simulations of the transport through the channel using a variant of the kinetic monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "both the simulations and the mean field results show that the forward times are increased due to the jamming while the backward times are decreased .",
    "the increase in forward exit times is easily understood considering the reduction in hopping rates inside the channel due to crowding .",
    "the origin of the decrease in the backward exit time is more subtle : the crowding increases the number of particles which hop backwards out of the channel immediately after their entrance . for wide channels that can accommodate more than one particle at each site , the mean field results for the directional transport times @xmath62 and @xmath37 agree closely with the simulations . for strictly single file channels ( @xmath71 ) , the mean field approximation underestimates the actual value of the exit time to the right @xmath62 and overestimates the exit time to the left @xmath37 , but still reproduces the right qualitative dependence of the times on the flux @xmath7 and other parameters .",
    "the reason for the underestimation of the time to exit to the right is that the mean field approximation neglects the correlation between successive jumps ( a particle hopping to one of its neighbor sites leaves behind it a vacancy and thus has a higher probability to hop back to the same site in the next jump ) .",
    "interestingly , the simulations show that the mean field result for the mean trapping time @xmath36 is exact ( at least for a uniform channel ) .",
    "the mean field approximation can be improved by taking into account the correlations in the jumping rates of the neighboring particles and the fluctuations of the density around its mean value .",
    "correction to the mean field diffusion rate of a tracer particle in equilibrium conditions were calculated in @xcite in the framework of effective medium theory . in general , such corrections to the mean field",
    "improve the approximation including our case ( data not shown ) ; however systematic analysis of such corrections lies outside the scope of the present work .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the effects of crowding and inter - particle competition for space on the transport times through narrow channels of finite length under a non - equilibrium steady state condition .",
    "the results of the mean - field analysis are corroborated by computer simulations .",
    "we have shown that in uniform channels the jamming increases the forward exit time , while decreasing the backward exit time .",
    "surprisingly , jamming does not affect the mean dwelling time in uniform channels .",
    "the situation might be different in non - uniform channels ; however , the mean field approximation should provide a qualitatively correct picture even in this case @xcite , full discussion of which lies beyond the scope of the present work and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the model provides a theoretical framework for analysis of single molecule transport through biological and artificial nano - channels .",
    "the parameters of the model , the rates @xmath5 and @xmath3 , can be related to the experimentally controlled factors such as diffusion coefficients inside and outside the channel and the binding affinity of the molecule in the channel .",
    "it is also important to emphasize the difference between the results of this paper and the well studied case of tracer diffusion in infinite single - file channels @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the methods of this work can be extended to treat arbitrary molecular signalling pathways , such as multi - step enzymatic reactions @xcite , conformational transitions of ion channels @xcite and other systems @xcite .",
