    "in a thermoelectric material , an applied heat gradient gives rise to an electric current or voltage and , conversely , an applied electric current gives rise to a temperature difference .",
    "therefore , thermoelectric devices can be used as power generators , converting heat into electric power , or as refrigerators , using electric power to accomplish cooling  @xcite .",
    "however , the efficiency of todays thermoelectric devices is much lower than that of the alternatives ( mostly using the compression and expansion of gases ) and their use is therefore limited to a number of niche applications where advantages such as small size , no moving mechanical parts , reliability , and capability to generate power also at small heat gradients give them the upper hand .",
    "many different ways to enhance the efficiency of thermoelectric devices have been proposed , the most relevant for the work we present here being nanoscaling , i.e. , the idea to reduce the dimensions of devices or introduce structuring on very small length scales , which was first investigated by hicks and dresselhaus  @xcite and has now seen some experimental success , see e.g. , refs .  .",
    "a question of more interest for fundamental physics is how good you can possibly make a thermoelectric device .",
    "focusing on a power generator for definiteness , the laws of thermodynamics sets a fundamental limit on the efficiency of any device extracting work by using the temperature difference between a hot bath ( temperature @xmath0 ) and a cold bath ( temperature @xmath1 ) , which can never be higher than the carnot efficiency , @xmath2 .",
    "it was shown in refs .   that a thermoelectric device can indeed , in theory , operate at the carnot efficiency .",
    "this is only possible for a material where electrons can only be transported at one particular energy , meaning that the transmission function ( for ballistic transport ) or transport distribution function ( for diffusive transport ) has to be proportional to the delta function .",
    "it has later been noted that quantum dots  @xcite or molecules  @xcite weakly coupled to leads would possess precisely such electronic transport properties due to the discrete orbitals .",
    "however , it has later been noted that discrete orbital states are not ideal when trying to operate a thermoelectric device at large output power , because this requires a large tunnel coupling to the leads which broadens the orbitals and spoils the delta - function like transmission  @xcite .",
    "recently , refs .   addressed , and solved , the problem of finding the transmission function which maximizes the efficiency at a given desired output power , showing that it should have a square shape ( i.e. , letting all electrons through within a finite energy window and blocking all transport outside this window ) .    in this work ,",
    "we theoretically investigate a superlattice - structured semiconductor nanowire ( nw ) in the regime of ballistic transport , and show that this is a possible realization of a system with a nearly perfectly square - shaped transmission function . the electron contribution to both the charge current and heat current",
    "is calculated taking the full voltage dependence and nonequilibrium condition into account , but neglecting the phonon contribution to the heat current ( which would simply be an additive loss - mechanism ) , inelastic scattering , and electron - electron interactions . in close analogy with anti - reflection coating used in optical systems ,",
    "a special choice of non - uniform barrier widths makes it possible to achieve energy windows with almost perfect transmission or reflections of electrons  @xcite , even with a rather small number of barriers .",
    "the electronic power - conversion efficiency can then come rather close to the carnot efficiency , and the efficiency remains large also when operating at large output powers . to investigate the demands our proposal sets on epitaxial nw growth , we investigate how the results depend on the number of barriers , showing that a rather small number is sufficient , as well as the sensitivity to random imperfections in the barrier width and separation .",
    "we here use parameters valid for inas nws , where barriers can be formed by controllable growth of inp segments  @xcite or of segments of wurtzite structure in an otherwise zinc blende nw  @xcite .",
    "previous studies have investigated thermoelectric effects in superlattice - structured nws in the linear response regime , see e.g. , refs .  , but , to the best of our knowledge , there have been no systematic attempts to design a square transmission function , or to investigate the nonlinear regime .",

    "our treatment is based on a coherent evolution along the superlattice neglecting dephasing .",
    "this is realistic at cryogenic temperature for superlattices up to 10 barriers as demonstrated in ref .  .",

    "if the transmission function close to @xmath21 is energy independent the imbalance in state occupations in the leads will give rise to a current of high - energy electrons with @xmath22 flowing from the hot to the cold lead , and an equally large current of low - energy electrons with @xmath23 flowing in the opposite direction . therefore , there will be a net heat current @xmath24 flowing from hot to cold , but no net electric current , @xmath25 . an electric current results if the transmission function is asymmetric around @xmath26 , for example letting only the high - energy electrons through as in fig .",

    "[ fig : setup](d ) by a resistor . here",
    "we will for simplicity instead consider @xmath28 to be externally controllable .",
    "the efficiency of the thermoelectric generator is now given by the generated electric power divided by the heat which is lost from the hot lead @xmath29 we will neglect all other contributions to @xmath30 except the heat carried by the electrons .",
    "it is important to realize that even though we neglect inelastic scattering of the electrons traversing the device between the hot and cold leads , there is no conservation of heat current , @xmath31 .",
    "instead , the first law of thermodynamics gives @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) can equivalently be written as @xmath34 .",

    "( [ eq : heatcurrent_multi ] ) and  ( [ eq : heatcurrent_3d ] ) for the corresponding expressions for multiple 1d channels and 3d devices , respectively ]",
    ". we can now understand the optimal shape of the transmission function . to maximize @xmath37 , we should allow electrons to travel only in one direction , for example from hot to cold , which requires a strong energy asymmetry in the transmission function .",
    "to minimize @xmath30 , we should , on the other hand , only let electrons through close to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the maximal @xmath38 is obtained when @xmath18 is maximally peaked in @xmath39 , i.e. , proportional to @xmath40  @xcite . however , a finite number of transport channels gives rise to a peak of finite height ( rather than a true delta function ) and @xmath41 , and therefore @xmath37 , approaches zero as this peaks becomes increasingly narrow .",
    "it was shown in refs .   that the optimal @xmath38 at a given @xmath37 is instead obtained when @xmath18 at a fixed @xmath28 has a square shape , allowing all electrons to be transmitted within an energy range determined by the desired efficiency and blocking all electrons outside this energy range .",
    "a sharp onset in the transmission function can be achieved by using doping or electrostatic gating to position the lowest 1d subband of a nw close to @xmath42 ( this idea was originally suggested by hicks and dresselhaus  @xcite , although they considered diffusive rather than ballistic transport ) .",
    "experimental realization of this proposal has been difficult , e.g. , because disorder introduces scattering which ruins the sharp onset of the transmission as the lowest subband falls below @xmath42 ( interestingly though , the resulting rapid fluctuations in the transmission close to pinch - off was recently shown to in some cases give rise to an increased @xmath37 compared with the bulk material  @xcite ) . in the superlattice structure",
    "we consider here , we can allow @xmath42 to lie well within the lowest subband , because the quantum mechanical reflection from the barriers block transport except for within narrow energy bands .",
    "we use a continuum model and want to calculate the current due to plane waves travelling in the @xmath3-direction , i.e. , we consider wavefunctions of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the radial part and @xmath45 where @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the effective mass in the @xmath3-direction and @xmath48 the energy of subband @xmath49 ( measured relative to @xmath8 ) . by matching the wavefunctions at points where the potential changes , we find the t - matrix @xmath50 which relates the coefficients of the rightgoing and leftgoing waves to the left of the potential change ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) to those to the right of the potential change ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 )  @xcite @xmath55 the t - matrix for a more complicated structure involving @xmath56 points where the potential changes is simply found by multiplying the individual t - matrices , @xmath57 and the total transmission amplitude is found from the matrix elements , @xmath58 . finally , the transmission function is given by @xmath59 ( assuming equal effective mass in regions @xmath60 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "the voltage dependence in @xmath61 originates from the variation in the potential profile along the wire when @xmath62 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the potential changes only in the barriers and remains constant in between , such that the total potential drop over the entire structure is equal to @xmath63 ( when the barriers have varying width we assume that the voltage drop over each barrier is proportional to its width ) .",
    "in addition , we neglect the small slope at the top of the barriers and assume them to remain square shaped",
    ". a more rigorous approach would be to self - consistently solve for the potential profile and charge density along the wire , but we do not expect significant deviations from our simpler method because we focus on small voltages and chemical potentials below the transmission band , and therefore small charge densities .",
    "to make the results as easy as possible to understand , we focus in sects .  [",
    "sec : res_transmission ] and  [ sec : res_generator ] on a fully 1d nw , meaning that all subbands except the lowest lies far above @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and we assume a perfect structure ( equal height , width , and spacings of all barriers ) .",
