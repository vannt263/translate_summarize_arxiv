    "given a manifold @xmath2 and a riemannian metric @xmath3 specified on @xmath2 , the ricci flow determines a one parameter family of metrics @xmath4 via the geometric evolution equation @xmath5 } , \\label{ricflow}\\ ] ] with initial condition @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 is the ricci tensor of the metric @xmath8 . ) ricci flow has been a very effective tool for studying the sorts of special geometries which a manifold admits . in most of these applications to date @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite , the flow is shown to converge to the special geometries ( e.g. , to a constant negative curvature hyperbolic metric for the ricci flow on any two dimensional manifold of genus greater than one ) .",
    "future applications , however , are likely to require that one understand ricci flows which develop singularities .    in this work ,",
    "we begin a program of numerical study of ricci flow singularities .",
    "we focus here on the following question : say we have a one parameter family of metrics @xmath9 specified on the manifold @xmath0 and say we know that the ricci flows @xmath10 starting at @xmath9 for very large @xmath11 converge ( with the volume suitably normalized ) to the round sphere metric , while the ricci flows @xmath10 for small values of the parameter @xmath11 become singular , in the sense that ( regardless of volume norm ) the curvature of @xmath12 grows without bound as @xmath13 increases . what happens to the ricci flows @xmath12 with intermediate values of @xmath11 ?",
    "is there , in particular , a certain threshold value @xmath14 for which the ricci flow has interesting intermediate behavior : neither convergence , nor formation of a standard singularity ?    for solutions of einstein s equations representing gravitational collapse ,",
    "this sort of question has been studied extensively @xcite @xcite . very distinct threshold behavior has been found , with a remarkable degree of universality .",
    "that is , in examining a number of one parameter families of initial data for gravitational collapse , one finds qualitatively the same sort of discretely self - similar solution occurring for threshold initial data for all of these families .    for ricci flow ,",
    "our work here is the first search for critical behavior .",
    "we have examined a particular one parameter family of spherically symmetric `` corseted sphere '' geometries on @xmath0 , with the parameter describing the degree of corseting at the equator , and therefore parametrizing the magnitude of the @xmath1 neck pinch curvature at the equator .",
    "we do indeed find numerically that for geometries with a small amount of corseting , the ricci flow converges to the round sphere metric , while for geometries with a large amount of corseting , an @xmath1 neck pinch singularity occurs .",
    "we find that there is a critical value of the parameter , dividing the two regimes .",
    "finally , our studies show that the ricci flow for the geometry marked by the critical parameter value neither converges to the round sphere geometry nor forms an @xmath1 neck pinch singularity .",
    "instead , this flow approaches a  javelin \" geometry , marked by curvature singularities at the poles , with roughly uniform curvature between the poles .",
    "this javelin geometry corresponds to the  type 3 \" singularity described by hamilton @xcite and discussed by chow.@xcite    we describe in detail in section 2 the corseted sphere geometries that we study here , and write out the detailed form of the ricci flow equations for these geometries .",
    "also in section 2 we describe our numerical methods .",
    "we present our results in section 3 , noting the behavior of the ricci flows for subcritical , supercritical , and critical initial geometries .",
    "concluding remarks appear in section 4 .",
    "the corseted sphere geometries and their flows are all represented by spherically symmetric metrics on @xmath0 of the form @xmath15 \\right )    \\label{metric}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 are standard angular coordinates on the three sphere ; spherical symmetry holds so long as we assume that the metric functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are functions only of @xmath19 .",
    "smoothness of the metric at the poles , where @xmath19 takes the values @xmath20 and @xmath21 , requires that @xmath17 and @xmath18 be even functions of @xmath22 in a neighborhood of the poles .",
    "therefore @xmath23 and @xmath24 must vanish at the poles .",
    "however , smoothness of the metric also requires that @xmath18 vanish at the poles . to avoid the numerically awkward imposition of two conditions on @xmath18 at a single point , it is convenient to replace the variable @xmath18 by @xmath25 .",
    "smoothness of the metric at the poles can then be enforced by the requirement that @xmath26 and @xmath27 vanish at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    to obtain the corseted sphere geometries , we set @xmath30 , and choose @xmath17 so that @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath11 is a constant , which parametrizes the degree of corseting for these geometries . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the geometry represents two round three spheres joined at the poles .",
    "this is a singular geometry . for @xmath11 positive",
    ", the cusp smooths out and the geometry is non singular ; however , for small values of @xmath11 one still expects the curvature at the tightly pinched equator to be very large . in figure 1",
    ", we graph the area of the @xmath36 cross - sections as a function of @xmath19 for a few representative values of @xmath11 .",
    "area of the @xmath1s as a function of @xmath37 for @xmath38 ( solid line ) , @xmath39 ( dashed line ) and @xmath40 ( dotted line ) . ]    in figure 2 , we graph the ricci curvature eigenvalue in the direction along the @xmath1 symmetry as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "note that as a consequence of the assumption in these geometries that @xmath30 , we verify that the coordinate @xmath19 gives the value of the geodesic distance in the radial direction .",

    "@xcite the strongly parabolic pde system generating the deturck flow is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the derivative operator associated with the metric @xmath44 , and where the vector field @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the connection of the metric @xmath44 and with @xmath48 being any fixed connection . for a given initial geometry",
    ", one can find the corresponding ricci flow @xmath4 by first finding the corresponding deturck flow @xmath44 , and then pulling back via the time dependent diffeomorphism generated by the vector field @xmath49 defined above .",
    "note that neither the ricci flow ( [ ricflow ] ) nor the deturck flow ( [ deturck ] ) preserves volume .",
    "one can normalize the volume for either of the flows by adding the term @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the spatial average of the scalar curvature , to the flow equation .",
    "alternatively , one can control the volume along either flow by periodic uniform blowups .",

    "to study these evolution equations numerically , we proceed as follows : we divide the spatial coordinate range @xmath63 of @xmath19 into @xmath64 pieces , so that we have @xmath65 .",
    "we choose @xmath55 grid points , including a pair which run outside the coordinate range .",
    "so the first spatial grid point is at @xmath66 , while the last is at @xmath67 . then a function of the form @xmath68 for fixed time @xmath69 is replaced by a set of @xmath55 numbers @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "spatial derivatives are replaced by centered finite differences in the following way : @xmath72 for the time dependence of these functions , we choose a fixed time step @xmath73 , and replace @xmath74 by the numbers @xmath75 .",
    "now , for an evolution equation of the form @xmath76 we numerically evolve using the approximation @xmath77 this evolution is implemented for all values of @xmath78 except @xmath79 and @xmath55 .",
    "note that these two `` ghost zones '' are not part of the manifold since @xmath37 is not in the range @xmath80 . at the ghost zones we use smoothness of the metric which implies that @xmath81 and @xmath82 vanish at the poles .",

    "as noted above , for small @xmath11 we expect that the geometry is sufficiently close to singular that the distorted @xmath0 will pinch off into a singularity , while for sufficiently large @xmath11 the flow may overcome the distortion to evolve the data to a single round @xmath0 .",
    "these expectations are confirmed by our numerical simulations .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show the results of a `` subcritical '' run , _",
    "i.e. _ one which does not result in a singularity . for this run",
    "we have chosen @xmath85 .",

    "@xmath17 for subcritical ricci flow ]    @xmath61 for subcritical ricci flow ]    rather than focusing on the evolution of the metric components , it is more instructive to examine the behavior of curvature . as a consequence of the spherical symmetry of the geometries ,",
    "the ricci tensor @xmath87 has two independent eigenvalues .",
    "we call these eigenvalues @xmath41 and @xmath88 where @xmath41 corresponds to the eigenspace in the symmetry @xmath1 directions and @xmath88 corresponds to the eigenspace orthogonal to the symmetry @xmath1 directions .",

    "one can express the invariants of the ricci tensor ( and since we are in 3 dimensions , the invariants of the riemann tensor as well ) in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath88 .",
    "we have @xmath94 figures 5 and 6 show the behavior of @xmath41 and @xmath88 for the same subcritical run .",
