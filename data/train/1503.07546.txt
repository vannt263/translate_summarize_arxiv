    "the population of neas is composed mostly by asteroids coming from the main - belt asteroids . according to @xcite , the three most important known sources of neas are the @xmath30 secular resonance with saturn , the 3:1 mean - motion resonance with jupiter , and the mars - crossing region .",
    "once belonging to the neas population the close encounters of those asteroids with the terrestrial planets are quite frequent .",
    "such characteristic makes the neas more accessible and so , interesting objects for exploration through space missions .",
    "example of a successful mission to a nea is the hayabusa mission , performed by the japan aerospace exploration agency and that explored the nea ( 25413 ) itokawa in september , 2005 @xcite . the osiris - rex is a mission developed by nasa designed to return to the earth with a sample of the nea ( 101955 ) bennu .",
    "the mission is planned to be launched in @xmath31 , and reach the nea in 2018 @xcite .",
    "besides those examples , we can also cite the don quijote program @xcite , the ishtar program @xcite , the projects simone @xcite and marco polo @xcite , all of them designed to send space probes to a nea .",
    "the multiple systems in the nea population are especially interesting for a space mission since they increase the observational possibilities . according to @xcite , approximately @xmath32 of the neas",
    "are expected to be multiple system .",
    "currently there are known 48 multiple systems in the neas population , being 46 binaries , and two triple systems : 2001 sn263 @xcite , and 1994 cc @xcite .",
    "the nea 2001 sn263 is the target of the aster mission - first brazilian deep space mission @xcite .",
    "it is a triple system with semi - major axis @xmath33 au , eccentricity @xmath34 and orbital inclination @xmath35 .",
    "the components of the system have diameters of about 2.6 km ( alpha ) , 0.8 km ( beta ) and 0.6 km ( gamma ) .",
    "with respect to the major body alpha , beta has a semi - major axis of 16.633 km - period of about 6.2 days , and gamma has a semi - major axis of 3.804 km - period of about 0.7 days @xcite .",
    "see tab . 1 for more details .",
    "the announcement of the aster mission has motivated a study aimed to characterize regions of stability of this system .",
    "@xcite characterized the stability regions around the components of the triple system for the prograde case .",
    "they performed numerical integrations , for a time span of two years , of a system composed by the sun , the planets earth , mars , jupiter , the three components of the triple system , and thousands of particles randomly distributed within the internal and external regions of the triple system , with relative inclinations between @xmath36 .",
    "for the planar case , it were found stable regions placed very close to alpha and beta .",
    "when the inclinations of the particles were considered , the effects of the kozai mechanism became observable turning the whole region around the three bodies unstable for particles with relative inclination @xmath37 , excepted for region 1 , where some particles survived .",
    "it were also characterized mean motion resonances with beta and gamma in the internal region .",
    "it was obtained that particles with @xmath38 km , experience the effects of a 3:1 resonance with gamma , while the particles with @xmath39 km and @xmath40 km , experience the effects of a 3:1 resonance with beta and of a 1:3 resonance with gamma , respectively . for the external region of the system ( besides gamma ) , it was found that the region is predominantly stable , and that the variation of inclination does not affect the stability of the particles .    for a space mission aimed to place the probe in the internal region of the system",
    "those results do not seem to be very interesting , since the stable regions found are tiny and also because those are the regions more likely to have debris .",
    "therefore , knowing that stable regions are greater for retrograde orbits @xcite , here we present a complementary study , considering now particles orbiting the components of the system in the internal and external regions , with inclinations between @xmath41 , i.e. , considering the retrograde case .    from the astronomy point of view ,",
    "the analysis made before @xcite for prograde orbits are more relevant because it is believed that the potential dust orbiting the system came from the original disk that formed the bodies , so they orbit in the prograde direction . in this case ,",
    "retrograde orbits are not very common for natural bodies , and they are valid only for particles that are captured by the system , so in a small number . on the other side , if the main goal is to study the system from the perspective of sending a spacecraft to visit the bodies , the retrograde orbits becomes an interesting option .",
    "the spacecraft can easily be placed in prograde or retrograde orbits , with about the same expenditure of fuel .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the stability of retrograde orbits .",
    "the regions of stable retrograde orbits can be useful to place a spacecraft in orbits that does not need major station - keeping maneuvers in order to observe the three bodies of the system .",
    "since the mission is planned to stay around one year in operation , a study of the stability of retrograde orbits are made for two years , that is a time that allows the designed mission with some extra time , in case the equipments last longer than planned .",
    "the idea is to find regions of stable retrograde orbits in locations where the prograde orbits are not stable .",
    "those orbits allow the spacecraft to be in stable orbits in regions unlikely to have particles that may damage the spacecraft .",
    "those regions are identified and shown in detail in the present paper .",
    "we present the regions of stability found for the retrograde case , and compare them with the regions found for the prograde case .",
    "our goal is to complement the results presented by @xcite , given a complete scenario on the dynamic of particles in the neighborhood of the system , and thus , provide important parameters that may guide the design of the aster mission .",
    "only the gravitational perturbations were considered in the present paper and in the previous one .",
    "the solar radiation pressure is a relevant mechanism to be considered in a more complete analysis since it is known that depending on the area - to - mass ratio it may result in significant eccentricity increase , and so , affect the stability .",
    "the analysis of how relevant this mechanism is for the specific problem of a space mission aimed to explore this triple system is the subject of a future work .",
    "such analysis must be guided by the results presented here and by @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec_conclusion ] , we present the conclusions of the work .",
    "in order to achieve our goal , we first seek characterize the stable and unstable regions in the region around the components of the triple system 2001 sn263 , for the retrograde case .",
    "we based the development of this work on the initial conditions and on the method adopted by @xcite , as follows .",
    "we considered a system composed by the sun , the planets earth , mars and jupiter , the three components of the system 2001 sn263 , and by thousands of particles randomly distributed around alpha , beta and gamma ( internal region ) , and around the whole system ( external region ) .",
    "the internal region was divided into four regions , defined by the approximated hill s radius of each body ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] ) .",
    "the regions 1 and 2 are the regions where alpha is gravitationally dominant .",
    "the region 3 is the region which beta dominates .",
    "the limit of this region was calculated for the problem involving alpha and beta , resulting in a hill s radius of @xmath42 km .",
    "the region 4 is the region which gamma theoretically dominates .",
    "the limit of this region was calculated for the problem involving alpha and gamma , resulting in a hill s radius of @xmath43 km .",
    "the region 1 is limited by the orbit of gamma , and the region 2 is limited by the orbit of beta .",
    "the limits of the external region are better explained in sec .",
    "[ sec_external ] .",
    "we randomly distributed particles within the regions 1 , 2 , 3 , and in the external region .",
    "the region 4 was not considered since it is too small , and would become even smaller if the perturbations from beta were considered .",
    "all the particles started with an eccentricity going from @xmath44 until @xmath45 , and with a random angular distribution : @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the true anomaly , @xmath50 is the argument of the pericentre and @xmath51 is the longitude of the ascending node .",
    "the radial distribution of those particles depends on the region being considered .",
    "regarding the inclination of the particles , we now considered the inclined retrograde case , meaning that all particles were distributed in the internal and external regions with an inclination with respect to the equator of alpha given in the range @xmath52 , taken every @xmath53 .",
    "we considered the oblateness of alpha , with @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the obliquity of alpha was also considered and was determined through the pole solution , presented by @xcite    beta and gamma were assumed to be spherical bodies with radius given in tab .",
    "a non - sphericity of gamma would not affect our results since we did not consider particles around this body .",
    "a non - sphericity of beta may change the results for region 3 , especially for those particles closer to this body .",
    "such exception must be taken into account in further studies or in practical applications .",
    "the method consisted on numerically integrate the equations of motion of the gravitational problem of n - bodies .",
    "the numerical integrations were performed with the gauss - radau numerical integrator @xcite , for a time span of @xmath55 years .",
    "this interval corresponds to about @xmath56 orbital periods of beta , and about @xmath57 orbital periods of gamma .",
    "the time step of the numerical integrations was of @xmath58 days , for the internal and the external regions .",
    "the physical data for alpha , and the orbital elements of beta and gamma are given by @xcite , for the epoch mjd 54509 in the equatorial frame of j2000 ( see tab .",
    "the orbital elements of alpha , earth , mars and jupiter were obtained through the jpl s horizons system for the same epoch , also for the equatorial frame .",
    "the planet saturn was not considered . due to the short time span of the numerical integration its gravitational perturbation , including the effects of the @xmath30 secular resonance ,",
    "is negligible .    throughout the numerical integrations ,",
    "the particles could collide with alpha , beta and gamma , or be ejected from the system .",
    "the collisions were defined by the physical radius of the three components .",
    "the distance of ejection @xmath59 was defined for each region . for regions 1 and 2",
    "it is defined by the collision - lines with gamma and beta , being @xmath60 km for region 1 and @xmath61 km for region 2 .",
    "the ejection limit for particles in region 3 is given by the approximated hill s radius of beta , being @xmath62 km .",
    "[ fig_system ] shows those limits .",
    "the ejection distance for the external region is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec_external ] .",
    "the stability and instability are defined by the number of particles that survive throughout the numerical integration .",
    "initial conditions that result in any loss of particles , by collision or ejection , define a stable region .",
    "otherwise , we define the unstable regions .",
    "following , we discuss special features of the method described above , and we present the results obtained for the internal region ( regions 1,2 and 3 ) and for the external region",

    "this effect is related to the kozai mechanism @xcite . for the retrograde case _ the critical angle of kozai _",

    "this was investigated and is presented as follows .",
    "we search for a commensurability of mean motion between particles with semi - major axis near @xmath76 km , with beta or gamma .",

    "we found that particles with @xmath82 km have a 2:1 commensurability of mean motion with gamma .",

    "an elliptical orbit with periapsis near the lower limit of this region and apoapsis near the upper limit of this region would allow the spacecraft to pass closer to both secondary bodies in a single stable orbit that stays inside a region that is free of concentration of particles .",
    "the external region are essentially stable for both , prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "nevertheless , we can detach a region of about @xmath132 km , going from @xmath133 km to @xmath134 km , beyond beta , that meet the _ preferred region _ requirement .",
    "this would be a very interesting region to place a space probe .",
    "there we may have a clean area with stable retrograde orbits around alpha that allow a close observation of the three components of the system .",
    "in the present paper we analyze stability regions of the triple system 2001 sn263 , for retrograde orbits in the internal and external regions of the system . based on those results , we detached the preferred regions , i.e , internal and external regions that are interesting to place a space probe aimed to explore this system .",
    "we applied the method adopted by @xcite , but now considering particles with retrograde orbits , i.e. , particles with @xmath41 relative to the equator of alpha , within and around the entire system .",
    "we analyzed the behavior of such particles to determine the stable regions for the retrograde case , and we compared our results with the planar and prograde cases    comparing our results with the planar and prograde cases we noted , as expected @xcite , a substantial increase of the stable region for both , internal and external regions when the retrograde orbits were considered .",
    "we found that nearly the whole internal region is stable , especially for low eccentricities values .",
    "the instability appears only in the border of the regions , or when the inclination of the particles are such that they are under the kozai mechanism action .",
    "the most prominent result was found for region 2 . comparing the simulations for particles with @xmath120 with those with @xmath2",
    ", we see that the region that is essentially unstable for the prograde case , became practically fully stable for the retrograde case .",
    "we found that the external region is also predominantly stable .",
    "the instability appears only in the borders of the region .",
    "the variation of inclination does not affect the stability of the particles .",
    "our results showed that the retrograde orbits are an interesting option for the aster mission .",
    "we detached at least four regions ( three internal and one external ) that can be very useful to this mission .",
    "all of them allow the space probe to closely observe the components of the system in stable retrograde orbits situated in regions expected to be free of debris .",
    "those results provide important information about the stability around the components of the system and substantially contribute to the design of the aster mission .",
