    "the inelastic and elastic mean free path ( mfp ) of an electron is the average distance an electron of a given kinetic energy travels in a material between two successive inelastic or elastic collisions , respectively  @xcite .",
    "electron mean free paths ( emfps ) are important quantities for a number of physico - chemical phenomena .",
    "these range from aerosol physics and chemistry , which influence the radiative energy balance of the earth and other planets , to photoemission processes in interstellar dust clouds , radiotherapy , and nuclear plant operation ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a complete understanding of the whole photoemission process from the absorption of light to the emission of electrons from the material is crucial in this context  @xcite . for many compounds , the values of the inelastic and elastic mfp",
    "are not known or inaccurate , largely due to various experimental difficulties . especially challenging",
    "are experiments at electron kinetic energies ( kes ) below 100  ev and for liquids , which can not be brought into vacuum as bulk  @xcite .",
    "while several methods have been introduced for the energy range from 15  ev to 100  ev , the uncertainties of the mean free paths remain high in the range below 15  ev  @xcite .",
    "recently , progress has also been made for liquids by employing liquid microjets  @xcite .    here , we introduce an alternative way to determine the mfps of slow electrons with kes below 20  ev which relies on angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of aerosol particles .",
    "aerosol particles are ionized by single photons from a vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) light source .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) distribution of the generated photoelectrons is then projected with a velocity map imaging ( vmi ) setup  @xcite on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) position sensitive electron detector  @xcite ( section  [ exp ] ) . to characterize the properties of photoelectrons ,",
    "we extract four parameters from the photoelectron images in addition to the electron kinetic energy : the total electron yield and three anisotropy parameters , which describe the anisotropy of the photoelectrons with respect to the propagation and the polarization direction of the ionizing radiation .",
    "these four parameters depend in a characteristic way on the emfps and the aerosol particle size .",
    "the emfps are extracted from fits of the simulated anisotropy parameters to the experimental ones varying the emfps .",
    "the simulated photoemission images are obtained from a simple model ( section  [ model ] ) .",
    "similar models have been widely used in the past , also for particulate matter ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "briefly , classical electrodynamics is employed to treat light - particle interaction and a simple three - step model is used to describe electron formation , transport in , and emission from the aerosol particles .",
    "the use of the aerosol approach has two main advantages compared with other methods .",
    "firstly , it allows one to determine emfps also for liquids , which can not be brought into vacuum as thin films or bulk due to their high vapor pressure .",
    "this is not a fundamental problem for aerosol droplets .",
    "secondly , aerosol data recorded over a range of different aerosol particle sizes in principle contain more information on the emfps than corresponding thin film , liquid jet , or bulk data , because the size - dependence of the anisotropy can be exploited in addition to the kinetic energy .",
    "the key point is as follows : the variation of the aerosol particle size changes the total path length of the ionizing radiation and the total scattering path lengths of the electrons inside the particles .",
    "in addition , the variation of size corresponds to a variation in curvature .",
    "this changes the geometry of electron escape from the particle .",
    "more importantly , the curvature characteristically modifies the pattern of the light intensity inside the particle and thus the ionization probability . in other words",
    ", the curvature strongly influences the anisotropy of the photoelectrons . since all these finite size effects depend in different ways on the emfp they provide characteristic and complementary information on the emfp .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is a proof of principle of the idea .",
    "we use potassium chloride ( kcl ) as a model substance because many of its properties are well known and aerosol formation is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , calculations for emfps at low kes already exist for kcl  @xcite , which allow for a comparison with results from the present work . in section  [ resu ] ,",
    "we first present the main prediction from modeling , which we then compare with preliminary experimental data for kcl aerosol particles .",
    "the model consists of three parts : the _ photonic model _ ( subsection  [ model-1 ] ) describes the interaction of the aerosol particle with the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the _ electron emission model _",
    "( subsection  [ model-2 ] ) includes the formation of the electron at a given location inside the aerosol particle , the transport of the electron through the particle , and its emission at the particle surface .",
    "the _ electron projection model _",
    "( subsection  [ model-3 ] ) defines the projection of the 3d photoelectron distribution onto a 2d detector plane .",
    "this subsection also introduces the parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , that describe the characteristics of the photoemission for comparison with experimental data .",
    "we use a 3d cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the center of the aerosol particle . the photons travel in the positive @xmath4  direction and",
    "are linearly polarized along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "the aerosol particles travel in the negative @xmath5  direction and the photoelectrons are projected in the positive @xmath6  direction onto the 2d detector plane which is parallel to the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "classical continuum electrodynamics is employed for modeling light - particle interaction . for the kcl particles , we use the frequency - dependent refractive index data in the vuv from ref .",
    "@xcite and assume spherical particles surrounded by vacuum .",
    "note that we find essentially the same results for spherical kcl particles as for an ensemble of randomly oriented kcl cubes with rounded corners , consistent with the results for nacl in ref .",
    "the ionizing radiation is modeled as a monochromatic plane wave which is linearly polarized along the @xmath5-axis , providing a good model for the synchrotron radiation used in the experiment . we assume that the probability of generating an electron at a specific location @xmath7 inside the particle is proportional to the intensity of the internal electric field @xmath8 at this location ( subsection  [ model-2 ] ) . the electric fields inside and outside the particle are calculated with the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) using the adda package  @xcite .",
    "we tested the accuracy of this approach with the lorenz - mie method which provides an analytical solution for spherical particles and with previously published data  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : adda ] shows the squared amplitude of the internal field @xmath9 , i.e.  the light intensity , in the @xmath4-@xmath5  plane through the center of a spherical particle with a radius of 5  nm , 100  nm , and 500  nm , respectively , at a photon energy of 10  ev .",
    "the light intensity inside the smallest particles is homogeneous .",
    "only a very minor decrease in intensity in the propagation direction of the light ( positive @xmath4  direction ) is visible , which is due to minor absorptions in the particle .",
    "the largest particle absorbs the light almost completely already in the outermost surface layer of the particle that faces the incoming radiation .",
    "there is no light that penetrates into the particle s core . for intermediate sizes , here a 100  nm particle , the light intensity inside the particle is strongly structured with regions of low and high intensity . as mentioned",
    ", these size - dependent intensity patterns together with the influence of the size - dependent curvature on the electron emission determine the anisotropy in the photoelectron images .",
    "we use a simple three - step model for the description of the electron emission  @xcite : the first step is the generation of the photoelectron at location @xmath7 inside the particle . once formed , it is randomly scattered inside the aerosol particle ( second step ) until it reaches the surface and is emitted from the particle into vacuum ( third step ) . for the first step , we assume that the probability @xmath10 of generating an electron at location @xmath7 inside the particle with momentum in direction @xmath11 is proportional to the light intensity ( subsection  [ model-1 ] ) and the classical dipole emission probability , i.e.   @xmath12 where @xmath8 is the internal electric field at location @xmath7 and @xmath11 is the angle between the directions of the internal electric field vector @xmath8 and the initial velocity vector @xmath13 of the electron .",
    "the initial electron kes @xmath14 are chosen randomly from a gaussian distribution modeled after the photoelectron spectrum of gas phase monomer kcl  @xcite in order not to include scattering _ a priori_. for photoelectron spectra recorded at photon energy @xmath15 , they fulfill the condition @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the band gap , for which we use a value of 8.4  ev  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian is centered at @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the half width at half maximum  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the exact shape of the curve and the exact initial ke distribution does not significantly influence the asymmetry parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the second step , the migration of the electron within the particle , is modeled as a random walk with the inelastic mfp and the elastic mfp as step lengths for inelastic and elastic scattering events , respectively . a random walk corresponds to isotropic scattering of the photoelectrons in the particle .",
    "this is probably a good assumption here because the directionality of scattering in bulk kcl is weak  @xcite and because our kcl particles are likely polycrystalline .",
    "the probabilities of inelastic scattering events @xmath20 and elastic scattering events @xmath21 is calculated as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ratio of the inelastic and the elastic mfp .",
    "we use @xmath24 in this work consistent with ref .  @xcite . as both elastic and inelastic scattering events",
    "are isotropic in our model , the value of @xmath23 does not significantly influence the anisotropy parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "their values for a 100  nm radius particle , for example , vary by less than 1% if @xmath23 is varied between 0.1 and 10 .",
    "note that scattering of low energy electrons in solids , in particular elastic scattering , is far from being understood  @xcite . for the mean energy loss per inelastic scattering event , the energy loss parameter  @xmath25",
    ", we use @xmath26 this corresponds to the value 9  mev at 270  k from ref .",

    "@xcite is used .",
    "again , we can show that the exact value of @xmath25 has only a minor influence on the asymmetry parameters .",
    "however , it will significantly affect the electron yield . since we did not perform yield measurements in the present work , we use 10  mev throughout the paper .",
    "for the third step , the emission of the electron at the particle surface into vacuum , the electron must fulfill the classical momentum threshold condition for escape @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angle between the electron velocity vector and the surface normal and @xmath29 is the electron ke  @xcite .",
    "both values are taken just before ejection ; i.e.  at the surface inside the particle .",
    "we use a value of @xmath30  @xcite and subtract it from the normal component of the electron ke just after ejection into vacuum . for every ejected electron , we store its velocity vector and its ke resulting in a 3d electron emission pattern . the corresponding velocity vector and the corresponding ke in the vacuum just after emission",
    "are referred to as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "experimentally , it is very challenging to record this 3d electron emission pattern .",
    "instead , we use velocity map imaging ( vmi )  @xcite in our experiments ( section  [ exp ] ) , which projects the emitted 3d electron distribution onto a 2d position sensitive electron detector with the help of an electrostatic lens system .",
    "the recorded 2d photoelectron images are referred to as `` experimental raw images '' in the following . to model the experimental projection , we map each electron onto the detector plane with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the azimuthal angle in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane with respect to the @xmath5 axis .",

    "the electron intensity decreases from yellow to red to blue color.,width=325 ]    to describe the angular dependence of the electron emission patterns , we extract from the raw images three anisotropy parameters , denoted as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "note that in vmi the 3d emission pattern can be retrieved from a reconstruction of the 2d raw image only if the electron distribution has an axis of cylindrical symmetry parallel to the detector plane  @xcite . in our case , however , the light attenuation inside larger particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : adda ] ) breaks this symmetry so that reconstruction is not possible .",
    "therefore , we determine the anisotropy parameters directly from the calculated or experimental raw image . for their definition , we split the image plane into two half - planes with @xmath36 and @xmath37 referred to as `` backward plane '' and `` forward plane '' , respectively ( fig .",

    "@xmath41 because there is no anisotropy in the propagation direction of the light for these samples . for kcl aerosol particles ,",

    "the inconsistency of @xmath2 observed for larger particle sizes could be a consequence of the low signal to noise in the photoelectron images .",
    "figure  [ fig : exp - vs - sim ] shows experimental and calculated photoelectron images for a 150  nm kcl particle .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is defined in the half - plane in which the number of detected electrons is low for larger particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : params ] ) because they originate from the particle hemisphere that is only weakly illuminated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : adda ] ) .",
    "therefore , the signal to noise ratio is lower and background contributions in the experimental image are higher in the half - plane which is used to determine @xmath2 compared with the one that is used for @xmath1 .",
    "this can result in ill - defined values for @xmath2 .",
    "the inconsistency of @xmath2 for larger particles might also originate from the energy dependence of the inelastic mfp . as discussed , fig .",
    "[ fig : en - dep ] shows that @xmath2 is more sensitive to this energy dependence compared with @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the comparison of experimental and calculated data in this figure also reveals that the energy dependence of the inelastic mfp can easily account for the apparent inconsistency of @xmath2 .",
    "the data for the interaction with the acoustic mode and a 1  nm inelastic mfp do no longer show any systematic deviation of @xmath2 for larger particle sizes . for an energy dependence of the inelastic mfp according to the acoustic mode , all three anisotropy parameters provide consistent results for the inelastic mfp .",
    "more accurate measurements will resolve which of these effects dominates , background contributions or the energy dependence of the inelastic mfp .",
    "but already the preliminary experimental data discussed here provide a convincing proof of principle for the new aerosol approach to determine mfps of slow electrons .",
    "this proof of principle study shows that angle - resolved aerosol photoelectron imaging opens up a new and potentially more accurate way to determine electron mfps for low ke electrons in solids and liquids , provided that accurate experimental data and a realistic model are available .",
    "the advantage of the aerosol approach arises from the characteristic information on the mfp that is contained in the anisotropy of the photoelectrons .",
    "the variation of the particle size - and thus the variation in curvature - results in characteristic modifications of the light absorption and the electron transport inside the aerosol particles and thus of the angular dependence of the photoelectrons .",
    "our modeling results clearly demonstrate that the use of the anisotropy information in principle allows one to extract detailed information on the mfps from fits of simulated photoelectron images to experimental ones .",
    "important for the determination of accurate mfps is the quality of the experimental photoelectron images .",
    "crucial are a good signal to noise ratio , low background contributions , a quality electron imaging system , and stable particle and photon fluxes .",
    "the first two factors strongly influence the quality of the anisotropy data .",
    "the third factor is crucial to obtain reliable data for the total electron yield . for the present study ,",
    "we use a velocity map imaging photoelectron spectrometer .",
    "we do not fit simulated photoemission images directly to experimental ones .",
    "instead , we first define four parameters ( the electron yield and three anisotropy parameters ) from the images , which we then use for the comparison between simulation and experiment . a major reason for this choice is the quality of the preliminary experimental data .",
    "in future studies , it is planned to directly fit whole images in order to exploit their full information content .",
    "the electron mfp is a model - dependent quantity .",
    "here , we used a simple conventional model as a start .",
    "the incorporation of more sophisticated models might further increase the utility of the aerosol approach  @xcite .",
    "the aerosol approach is particularly attractive for very low - kinetic energy electrons and for liquids for which experimental data on mfps are urgently needed .",
    "mfps of low - kinetic energy electrons are important in many different fields ranging from astrophysics to radiotherapy , and liquid phase chemistry .",
    "we have performed first experiments for various liquids and are currently applying the aerosol approach to these systems .",
    "we would like to thank egor chasovskikh for the design of the aerodynamic lens and david stapfer from our lpc mechanical shop for the fabrication of the aerosol dryer , the aerodynamic lens , and the vmi optics .",
