    "coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite and in particular the related effect of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite have been studied theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite in various energy - level schemes based on a generic @xmath5-scheme ( see fig .",

    "a more general condition for eit is two - photon resonance , a condition that is satisfied when the frequency difference between the fields matches the energy gap between levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , on the exact eit resonance , probe field decouples from the atoms , making the dynamics purely linear .",
    "optical nonlinearities in a multilevel atomic or molecular system in the presence of eit , usually arise by one of the two following related mechanisms .",
    "one is to violate the strict two - photon resonance condition , with a frequency mismatch smaller than the width of the transparency window  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can add additional energy level(s ) in order to induce an ac - stark shift and effectively tune the signal out of resonance  @xcite .",

    "the double @xmath5 nature of this _ m _ configuration offers the opportunity of a simultaneous group velocity reduction for pulses propagating inside the atomic sample .",
    "group velocity matching , originally pointed out by lukin and imamolu  @xcite , is important to obtain a large xpm .",
    "in fact , it has been shown by harris and hau  @xcite that if equal group velocity reduction is not achieved for both fields , the nonlinear phase accumulation will saturate at a certain constant value .",
    "the consequence is that increasing the length of the sample in which the nonlinear interaction takes place is not useful . on the other hand ,",
    "if group velocities are equal , the nonlinear phase accumulation becomes linear in the interaction length  @xcite and it may become very large .",
    "a large cross kerr phase shift is very useful for photonic - based implementations of quantum information ( qi ) processing systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , a fundamental building block for quantum information processing is the quantum phase gate ( qpg ) . in a qpg",
    ", one qubit gets a phase conditional to the other qubit state according to the transformation  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 denote the logical qubit bases .",
    "this gate is universal when the conditional phase shift ( cps ) @xmath13 is nonzero , and it is equivalent to a cnot gate up to local unitary transformations when @xmath14 @xcite .    to obtain a cps of @xmath14 ,",
    "one looks for a strong interaction between qubits , ideally accompanied by weak decoherence .",
    "photons are a particularly attractive choice for qubits due to their robustness against decoherence during the processing and transmission of information",
    ". this feature should ideally permit the transmission of the quantum information stored in very weak quantum pulses over very long distances with a negligibly small reduction of the initial signal .",
    "there is however an important difficulty in the implementation of an all  optical  qpg : to process the information one needs strong photon  photon interaction .",
    "in fact , to implement qi with photons , a nonlinear interaction is needed either to build a two - photon gate operation  @xcite or at the detection stage in linear optics quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the generation of single - photons ( which is also necessary in linear optics quantum computation ) also relies on nonlinear interactions .    in this paper",
    "we perform a semiclassical analysis of the interaction of light with atoms in the _ m _ configuration , in which the amplitude of the four fields involved is described in terms of the corresponding rabi frequency .",
    "the aim is to estimate the effects of noise sources , such as dephasing and spontaneous emission , both on the nonlinear interaction and on group velocity matching .",

    "the only points in which the two curves do not coincide exactly are when the detunings match the rabi frequencies of the two pumping field .",

    "in fact , sometimes it may be convenient to use transitions with different clebsch - gordan coefficients , yielding therefore a significant discrepancy between @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "the other symmetry conditions above are less problematic because detunings and rabi frequencies can always be made equal by the experimenter , and moreover decay and dephasing rates , even though not perfectly equal , are often comparable to each other . just to give an example , one could implement the symmetric _ m _ scheme of fig .  [",
    "fig : sms ] by using the @xmath161 and @xmath162 line of the @xmath17rb spectrum .",
    "the zeeman sublevels @xmath250 and @xmath251 could be chosen as levels @xmath0 and @xmath16 , respectively , while the zeeman sublevels @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 could chosen as levels @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath15 , respectively ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar choice ) . for these levels",
    "the atomic transitions related to the probe and trigger have dipole moment matrix elements @xmath248 , @xmath249 differing by a factor @xmath255 , violating therefore the symmetry condition .",
    "it is evident however that this slight asymmetry can be compensated ( so that group velocity matching can be still achieved in a restricted but still useful range of detunings ) by properly adjusting the rabi frequencies of the tuner field @xmath24 and of the coupling field @xmath2 , which will be no more equal .",
    "in fact , by imposing group velocity matching at the center of the transparency window , i.e. , for @xmath256 , we derive the condition @xmath257 where the _ correction factor _",

    "the asymmetry between the two dipole moment matrix elements has been compensated by adjusting the value of @xmath2 . in this way group velocity matching",

    "[ sec : pulseprop ] ) is absent in the symmetric arrangement .",
    "this is because the dispersion , and the related group velocity reduction have its origin in the _ linear _ part of the susceptibility for both , probe and trigger pulses .",
    "hence there is no apparent singularity in the trigger group velocity , which in asymmetric case stemmed from the nonlinear origin of trigger dispersion .",
    "we have studied a five - level atomic system in two different but related @xmath265-configurations .",
    "we focused on the nonlinear properties of the system and specifically on the conditions for the optimization of the cross - phase modulation between two weak fields of interest , which we have named probe and trigger fields .",
    "both systems have been studied from a semiclassical point of view , i.e. , by describing all the fields in terms of their rabi frequencies .",
    "we have seen that both linear and nonlinear properties are well described by an approach based on amplitude variables , which has been shown to reproduce well the numerical solution of the exact optical bloch equations describing the system .",
    "both the asymmetric and the symmetric _ m _ scheme are able to provide a giant cross - kerr modulation , which may be useful for many applications . both _",
    "m _ schemes can be seen as a `` duplication '' of the usual three - level @xmath5 scheme at the basis of eit , one for the probe and one for the trigger fields . in the asymmetric scheme ,",
    "only the probe drives a significantly populated transition and a large cross - kerr effect is obtained when either the probe or the trigger is slightly detuned from the two - photon resonance condition .",
    "the corresponding nonlinear phase shift , yielding for example the conditional phase shift of eq .  ( [ eq : def_cps ] ) of a quantum phase gate for photonic qubits , can become very large , especially when the probe and trigger group velocities , slowed down by eit , become equal . in the asymmetric scheme",
    ", this group velocity matching can be achieved by properly adjusting the detuning and the intensity of the control field of the trigger @xmath5 system . in the symmetric _",
    "scheme , the atomic population is equally shared by the probe and trigger transitions . adjusting the corresponding parameters ( rabi frequencies , detunings ) so that the two @xmath5 systems become identical , probe and trigger experience the same interaction with the atomic medium and group velocity matching is achieved automatically . in this case",
    "a significant nonlinear cross - phase modulation is achieved only if both @xmath5 schemes are slightly and equally detuned from two - photon resonance , so to remain still within the transparency window .",
    "in fact , due to eit , the susceptibility vanishes at all orders at the exact two - photon resonance condition .",
    "from eqs .  ( [ eq : hameff ] ) and ( [ eq : blochgen ] ) , and using the definitions of eqs .",
