    "at the outer edge of the solar system exists a swarm of small icy rocks known as the oort cloud @xcite .",
    "comets with long orbital periods , @xmath5 , are ejected from this cloud into the inner solar system by the perturbations from passing stars , giant molecular clouds or tides from the galactic disc .",
    "the perturbed comets are moved onto nearly - parabolic orbits which approach the sun , develop comae and may be detected .",
    "gravitational perturbations by the planets can strongly alter the comets orbits as they enter the inner solar system , and so typically they either get ejected from the solar system or left strongly bound to the sun .",
    "it is very unlikely that a comet will return again on a nearly parabolic orbit .",
    "the observed continual flux of long period comets on nearly parabolic orbits originally led @xcite to propose that all long period comets were entering the inner solar system for the first time and therefore a resevoir of comets must exists in the outermost region of the solar system .",
    "there is considerable interest in studying the oort cloud since it is a remnant of the formation epoch of the solar system .",
    "this is true for both the individual objects , whose chemical composition may reveal information about the composition and thermal state of the outer regions of the proto - planetary disc ( but see @xcite for a comprehensive review of processes that may cause significant evolution in these properties over the past @xmath6 ) as well as the dynamical structure of the oort cloud as a whole .",
    "the cloud structure , which is largely determined by its formation scenario , may retain information about the masses of the giant planets , the rate at which passing stars perturbed the comets orbits and the surface density of any gas that was potentially still within the solar system .",
    "this information could provide important clues about the formation processes of the outer planets .",
    "the oort cloud is cruedly divided into an inner and an outer region .",
    "this division stems from the fact that the probability for ejection into the inner solar system by external perturbations is a strong function of semi - major axis @xcite .",
    "all of the observed long - period comets are believed to have originated from the outer oort cloud .",
    "the perturbations that eject comets into the inner solar system also isotropize the comets orbits and eliminates any information about the formation epoch in the structure of the outer oort cloud .",
    "therefore the reduced sensitivity of the comets in the inner oort cloud to these external perturbers is both good and bad . on the one hand it leads us to suspect that the structure of the inner oort cloud should retain an imprint of its formation as well as any rare , strong gravitational scattering event that might have occured over the past 4.5 billion years . on the other hand",
    ", it makes studying the inner oort cloud difficult .",
    "it is impossible to directly observe the comets in the inner oort cloud through their reflected sunlight because they are too far .",
    "extremely large objects like sedna can be optically detected when they are close to perihelion @xcite , however it will be difficult to detect the potentially large number of small objects ( @xmath7 ) in this region .",
    "one novel technique involves using the microwave emission from these bodies to constrain , or possibly detect , the bulk properties of objects in this region @xcite .    at a distance @xmath8 from the sun",
    "an oort cloud object will be heated by the sun to an equilibrium temperature , @xmath9 here we adopted an albedo of @xmath10 @xcite and an emissivity of @xmath11 .",
    "we adopt a model such that the emissivity of an oort cloud object is approximately unity when its size is larger than the wavelength of the relevant radiation and zero when the wavelength is larger . also , @xmath12 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath13 is the solar luminosity .",
    "the equilibrium temperature is higher than the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature of @xmath14 @xcite . when the comets are farther away from the sun a variety of physical processes help maintain temperatures greater than @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the oort cloud objects extinguish some fraction of the cmb radiation and emit blackbody radiation at a higher temperature @xcite .",
    "the observed intensity of the cmb radiation is then @xmath16b_{\\nu}[t_{\\rm cmb}(\\hat{\\bm n } ) ]   + \\tau(\\hat{\\bm n } ) b_{\\nu}[t_{\\rm oort}(\\hat{\\bm n})],\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the optical depth and @xmath18 is temperature of the oort cloud objects along the direction @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite constrained the mean , or monopole , contribution to the cmb spectrum using the _ cosmic background explorer far infrared absolute spectrophotometer _",
    "( cobe firas ) data @xcite and placed upper limits on the total mass in the inner oort cloud for a variety of models of the size distribution of oort cloud objects . in this paper",
    "we will focus on effects that can make the oort cloud non - spherical and subsequently produce anisotropic spectral distortions in the cmb .",
    "we should emphasize that the induced spectral distortions considered in this paper are not the chemical potential ( @xmath20 ) or compton - y spectral distortion that are commonly discussed in the literature .",
    "the signal produced in the outer solar system is that of a sum of weighted blackbodies at different temperatures , which in general does not have a blackbody frequency spectrum .",
    "the exception is the rayleigh - jean s portion of the spectrum , where the weighted sum of blackbodies does produce a frequency spectrum described by a rayleigh - jean s distribution at a weighted temperature .",
    "this implies that low frequency data will not be very useful in allowing us to detect a signal originating from the outer solar system .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of techniques to distinguish the spectral distortions produced in the outer solar system from those caused by the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "the oort cloud is believed to be nearly spherical based on the statistics of the inclination angles of new long period comets @xcite .",
    "the observed apsides of these comets are not uniformly distributed across the sky , however the observed clustering trends are believed to be due to the structure of the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "the oort cloud has been populated by objects that formed in the sun s proto - planetary disc and were scattered multiple times by the four giant planets into increasingly higher eccentricity and higher energy orbits .",
    "this process continued until some external perturbation lifted the comets perihelia well beyond neptune s orbit , and then the comets became decoupled from the inner solar system .",
    "the radial distribution of the oort cloud comets , which is set by how far the gas giant planets can scatter the comets before their perihelia is lifted safely outside the inner solar system , strongly depends on the external environment of the young solar system .",
    "the evolutionary processes that lifted the perihelia of comets beyond the planetary region of the solar system must have also made shperical the distribution of comets which where initially in the ecliptic plane .",
    "simulations of this formation process have found an inner edge of the oort cloud , defined as the semi - major axis at which the comets are isotropically distributed , near @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that objects with smaller semi - major axes exist , but may be more confined towards the ecliptic plane .",
    "this is the scattered disc which smoothly extends from the flattened kuiper belt to the spherical oort cloud",
    ". we will quantify the effect of the scattered disc by calculating the quadrupole moments of its thermal emission .",
    "this will exist irregardless of any externally induced asphericity in the oort cloud .",
    "an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the solar system did not form in isolation , but in a stellar cluster which subsequently evaporated @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since most low mass stars are observed to form in clusters that subsequently evaporate when the interstellar gas , which is required to gravitational bind the cluster , is expelled from the cluster by either stellar winds or supernova feedback @xcite . beyond this general trend , anomalous abundance ratios are observed in the solar system that would indicate that a type ii supernova occur somewhere in the vicinity of the solar system during its infancy @xcite . with a higher number density of stars in the cluster",
    "the rate of external perturbations would have been higher and the spherical inner edge of the oort cloud would have extended to smaller semi - major axes .    in this paper we will consider the dynamical effect that a star passing within @xmath23 of the sun would have had on the oort cloud .",
    "and we calculate the signatures that would be produced in the cmb frequency spectrum .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : signal ] we describe how a non - sherical distribution of oort cloud objects may affect the measured brightness distribution of the cmb on the sky . in ",
    "[ sec : poisson ] we calculate the variance of the oort cloud signal due to poisson fluctuations , whereas in  [ sec : ic ] we describe the initial distribution of oort cloud objects . in ",
    "[ sec : calc ] we outline of method of calculation the perturbations in the orbital elements of the oort cloud objects , and in  [ sec : impact ] we calculate the distribution of impact parameters of stellar perturbers . in  [",
    "sec : virial ] we derive an formula based on the collisionless boltzmann equation that allows us to analytically estimate the resulting quadrupole distortion from a perturbation .",
    "our results are discussed in  [ sec : results ] . in  [",
    "sec : bayes ] we develop a bayesian estimator that can be used to constrain the parameters of a stellar encounter from the observed cmb data .",
    "finally  [ sec : concl ] summarizes our main conclusions , appendix [ sec : quad ] derives relationships between various measures the quadrupole moment and appendix [ sec : noise ] describes the model of instrumental noise for the planck satellite .",
    "we start by calculating how the non - sphericity of the oort cloud affects the measured angular distribution of the cmb intensity . the fluctuation in the cmb frequency spectrum along",
    "a given direction @xmath24 can be expressed as @xmath25 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the probability distribution of orbital elements describing the keplerian orbits of the oort cloud objects around the sun .",
    "the first term on the right is due to the extragalactic cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "the cmb signal that comes from the surface of last scattering ( @xmath27 ) has a blackbody frequency distribution that is parameterized by slightly different temperatures in different directions @xcite .",
    "once we have subtracted off the frequency spectrum corresponding to the average cmb temperature , eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_i ] ) , the cmb temperature anisotropies induce some spectral distortion since we have removed a blackbody at an incorrect temperature for that particular pixel .",
    "the second term is caused by the oort cloud objects in the outer solar system as described in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , where @xmath8 is the distance of the oort cloud object from the sun .",
    "the absolute covering fraction is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the radius of the oort cloud object .",
    "the absolute covering fraction is related to the optical depth as @xmath30 .",
    "since the individual objects are optically thick , but sparsely fill the telescope beam function with which the cmb sky has been observed , the optical depth is simply related to the covering fraction of oort cloud objects .",
    "we add the term absolute because @xmath31 is the covering fraction if all oort cloud objects were placed at a standard distance .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that the physical size and the orbital elements of the oort cloud objects are uncorrelated .",
    "this assumption allows us to decouple the probability distribution of the orbital elements used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_int ] ) from the size distribution , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass_func ] ) and used to calculate the absolute covering fraction .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the comets behave as test particles with respect to sun and the perturbing star . for the internal density of the oort cloud objects we adopt a value of @xmath32 .    in order to relate the mean optical depth to a total mass of the inner oort cloud",
    ", the differential mass function must be specified .",
    "we model it as a broken power - law is related to the values used in this paper as @xmath33 . ]",
    "@xmath34 the mass distribution yields the total mass through the integral @xmath35 the empirical values of the above power - law indices are not known . for the kuiper belt , the slope of the high mass distribution has been restricted to the range @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "there are no strong observational constraints on the slope of the low mass distribution , @xmath37 ; however , it can be calculated through the assumption of collisional equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the exact value of the slope then depends on the assumed material strength of the kuiper belt objects .",
    "similiar constraints on the inner oort cloud mass distribution does not exist . since",
    "collisions have not been numerous enough to affect the slope of the high mass distribution , it is reasonable to adopt the observed value of the slope of planetesimals in the proto - planetary disc and use it for the distribution of inner oort cloud objects .",
    "we will adopt @xmath38 for the calculations in this paper .",
    "the collisional grinding of the kuiper belt objects , which justifies the above assumption of collisional equilibrium , is believed to have occurred amongst the objects at their current location .",
    "the collision timescales in the oort cloud are much longer , so a state of collisional equilibrium can not have been reach if the objects were always at their present locations .",
    "fortunately collisions are believed to have been frequent during the formation phase of the oort cloud while the objects were still in the planetary region of the solar system @xcite .",
    "again we will adopt the kuiper belt value of @xmath39 .",
    "our choice of this value is conservative , since the primordial slope was likely steeper , providing even better constraints than we will derive .",
    "we assume @xmath40 @xcite , as the upper mass limit .",
    "our results are insensitive to changes in the upper mass limit for @xmath41 .",
    "we will take the minimum mass to correspond to objects of radius @xmath42 .",
    "this quantity depends on the detailed formation history of the oort cloud and is , therefore difficult to calculate from first principles .",
    "the minimum object mass is partially degenerate with the total mass of the outer solar system which is also unknown , so for the purposes of this paper we will fix the minimum radius at @xmath42 .",
    "however , we note that the efficiency of blackbody emission is suppressed when the radiation wavelength is larger than the size of object emitting the radiation due to kirchoff s law @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that we only need our adopted model of the size distribution to convert a total mass of the oort cloud into an optical depth ; if we simply choose a value for the optical depth then the rest of this paper would be independent of our assumed size distribution .    for the location of the break in our mass model ,",
    "we assume @xmath43 ( corresponding to @xmath44 ) .",
    "this value is established by requiring that objects of this size were likely to have undergone a collision during the time period of oort cloud s formation .",
    "the formation of the oort cloud most likely was a continuous process so it is difficult to precisely define its formation time . in simulations",
    "this time period can roughly be estimated as @xmath45 based on a visual inspection ( see fig .",
    "8 of @xcite )",
    ". the collision rate of objects of size @xmath29 in a protoplanetary disc is @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath12 is the surface mass density of planetesimals , @xmath47 is the keplerian velocity and @xmath48 is the planetesimal density .",
    "we adopt minimum mass solar nebula value for the surface density of condensates @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "now the break radius can be calculated as @xmath50 a full simulation would be required to precisely determine this quantity as well as its radial dependence within the oort cloud .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the hst results of @xcite for the kuiper belt .",
    "our results are insensitive to the precise choice of these values since they are dominated by the smallest objects which have the largest surface area to volume ratio .",
    "the total mass in the oort cloud is calculated by requiring there to be @xmath51 in objects @xmath52 in the outer oort cloud @xcite .",
    "this figure is related to the observed number of new long period comets and implies there is approximately @xmath53 comets present in the outer oort cloud .",
    "we use our adopted models to relate this number of comets to the total mass in the inner oort cloud . for simplicity",
    "we assume equal amounts of mass in the inner and outer oort clouds .",
    "simulations of the formation of the oort cloud have implied that the inner oort cloud is more massive @xcite , while others have implied that the outer oort cloud is more massive @xcite .",
    "this uncertainity , as well as the uncertainity in other aspects of our model , should be remembered when interpreting our results . in table",
    "[ qaz ] we present slightly different models and calculate the total number of objects , the total mass and the effective optical depths of these models .",
    "we quote the absolute covering fraction @xmath54 divided by the mean squared distance @xmath55 the distribution of semi - major axes and the limits of integration are described in  [ sec : ic ] . for definitiveness",
    "we adopt @xmath56 ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 for our calculations in table [ qaz ] .",
