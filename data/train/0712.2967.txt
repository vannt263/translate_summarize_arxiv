    "existence of a supercurrent in a josephson junction is the manifestation of the interference between the macroscopic wave functions ( superconducting order parameters ) of the two contacted superconductors .",
    "the quantum interference can be modulated by an external magnetic field applied to the junction . as the result the critical(maximum )",
    "supercurrent @xmath2 shows a well - known fraunhofer diffraction pattern - like dependence on the magnetic flux @xmath3 penetrating the junction area . in a superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) junction the critical current , @xmath7 oscillates with the period of flux quantum @xmath8 and an amplitude decreasing as @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the main features of the effect , _",
    "i.e. _ damped oscillations of @xmath9 with the magnetic flux , take place in other types of josephson weak links , however the detailed behavior , including the period of the oscillations and the rate of damping , depends on the geometry as well as the nature of the weak link .",
    "in a wide sns ( n being a normal metal layer ) junction @xmath9 has a similar magnetic interference pattern as sis systems@xcite . on the other hand , heida _ et al . , _",
    "@xcite investigating s - two - dimensional - electron - gas - s ( s2degs ) junctions of comparable width @xmath10 and length @xmath1 , have measured a 2@xmath5 periodicity of the critical current instead of the standard @xmath5 periodicity .",
    "the first explanation of this finding was due to barzykin and zagoskin @xcite , who considered a s2degs junction with perfect andreev reflections at ns interfaces and both absorbing and reflecting lateral boundaries , obtained a 2@xmath5 periodicity in the limit @xmath11 ( _ i.e. _ in the limit of the point - contact geometry ) .",
    "later , ledermann _ et al . , _ @xcite considered more realistic reflecting boundaries at the edges and found that in the limit of strip geometry ( @xmath12 ) the periodicity of the critical current changes from @xmath5 to 2@xmath5 as the flux through the junction increases . in general , increase of the periodicity was attributed to the nonlocality of the supercurrent density in hybrid ns structures .    in this paper",
    "we report on a new type of magnetic interference pattern in a planar sns junction .",
    "the sns junction studied below consists of a thin normal metal layer of thickness @xmath0 on which two superconducting electrodes are deposited in a distance @xmath1 of each other ( fig .",
    "[ mzbfig1 ] ) .",
    "an external magnetic field is applied in plane of n - layer perpendicular to the direction of the josephson current flow .",
    "such a josephson setup was recently used in the experiment by keizer  _ et al._@xcite to investigate the josephson supercurrent through a s - half - metallic - ferromagnet - s ( shmfs ) junction .",
    "they used nbtin superconducting electrods on top of a thin layer of cro@xmath13 , which is a fully polarized ( half - metallic ) ferromagnet , _",
    "i.e. _ it supports only one spin direction of electrons .",
    "surprisingly , josephson supercurrent was detected for the junction length @xmath14 in spite of strong pair breaking in cro@xmath13 which is expected to suppress all singlet superconducting correlations .",
    "ref . also reports measurement of the magnetic interference pattern with magnetic field applied in plane of hmf - layer .",
    "it is found that @xmath2 oscillates with the in - plane flux @xmath3 with a period of order @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to a standard magnetic interference pattern ( [ fraunhofer ] ) , @xmath9 has nonzero values at the minima and the amplitude of the oscillations decreases rather slowly compared to @xmath6 .",
    "the long range superconducting proximity in hmf can be explained in terms of the triplet superconducting correlations generated at spin - active hmfs - interfaces as the result of interplay between the singlet superconducting correlations and a noncollinear magnetization inhomogeneity  @xcite .",
    "while the singlet superconducting correlations are destroyed over a short distance of the fermi wave - length , the triplet components can survive over distance of the order of the normal coherent length @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the fermi velocity . in ref .",
    "by investigating the critical supercurrent for different distances between the electrodes it was concluded that the length dependence is the same as in nonmagnetic sns junctions .",
    "this strongly suggests indeed that triplet correlations are responsible for the observed josepshson current .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate @xmath2 in such a planar sns junction . whereas this problem is interesting by itself",
    ", we also believe that it is relevant for the understanding of the experimental results of ref . .",
    "indeed , penetration of triplet correlations in shmfs junction is similar to an ordinary ( singlet ) superconducting proximity in sns systems , _",
    "i.e. _ both decay exponentially within the length scale @xmath17 . by noting this fact we will use the quasiclassical green s function formalism to investigate the magnetic flux dependence of the supercurrent in the corresponding planar sns junction ( see fig . [ mzbfig1 ] ) .",
    "we find that the magnetic interference pattern is significantly different from that of the standard one .",
    "the period of the oscillations can be smaller than @xmath5 depending on the length - to - thickness ratio @xmath4 .",
    "the period tends to @xmath5 at higher magnetic fluxes and also for very large @xmath4 .",
    "we also obtain the two anomalous features observed in the experiment : the amplitude of the oscillations has a rather slow decrease with @xmath3 compared to the standard sis case ( [ fraunhofer ] ) , and the critical current as the function of the flux , @xmath2 , at low temperatures can have finite minima when the total flux @xmath3 is integer or non - integer multiplies of the @xmath5 depending on the period of the oscillations .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce our model of a ballistic planar sns contact and present solutions of the eilenberger equation for the quasiclassical green s functions of a given electronic trajectory . introducing the effect of the in - plane magnetic field through a gauge invariant phase we obtain the expression of the critical supercurrent as a function of the magnetic flux .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the analysis of the @xmath2 in terms of @xmath4 for different temperatures . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we present the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we calculate the josephson current for a clean sns junction in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath18 . the setup is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ mzbfig1 ] .",
    "it consists of a normal metallic ( n ) layer of the thickness @xmath0 and width @xmath10 on which two superconducting electrodes are deposited in a distance of @xmath1 .",
    "this planar josephson structure was studied experimentally in ref . with a half metallic n layer .",
    "a phase difference @xmath19 between order parameters of the superconductors drives a josephson supercurrent through the parts of n layer underneath the superconductors and the junction n part ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath21 is applied in the plane of n layer perpendicular to the direction of supercurrent flow .",
    "we consider a clean structure with all dimensions @xmath22 being smaller than the electronic impurity mean free path @xmath23 and ideally transparent ns - interfaces . at the same time",
    ", the fermi wavelength is small compared to @xmath24 and the superconducting coherence length @xmath25 ( we use the system of units with @xmath26 ) . under these conditions",
    "the electronic properties of the system can be derived from the eilenberger equations for the semiclassical matrix green s function @xmath27 , @xmath28+[\\hat { \\delta}(\\textbf{r}),\\hat{\\textit{g}}~ ] ,   \\label{jc : eq1}\\ ] ] the matrix green s function @xmath29 where the normal @xmath30 and anomalous @xmath31 green s functions depend on the matsubara frequency @xmath32 , on the coordinate @xmath33 , and the direction of motion @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ( i=1,2,3 ) denotes the pauli matrices in the nambu space , and the matrix @xmath36 represents the superconducting order parameter @xmath37 .",

    "then will have only phase effect which we will include by introducing the gauge invariant phase as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the phase difference between two superconductors in the absence of the magnetic field , the second part is the phase accumulated by the quasiparticle on the trajectory due to the magnetic field @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being the length of the trajectory inside n - layer .",
    "the vector potential is taken to be @xmath47 .",
    "a typical trajectory consists of three parts : the part extended from bulk of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) to a point at @xmath50-interface @xmath51 , the part inside n layer ( @xmath52 ) which extends from a point at @xmath50-interface to a point at @xmath53-interface and the last part which extends from the point @xmath54 to the bulk of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 .",
    "our equations are supplemented by the boundary conditions which determine the values of green s functions in the bulk @xmath57 and @xmath55 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the temperature - dependent superconducting gap .",
    "we neglect the variation of the order parameter close to ns - interfaces inside the superconductors and approximate the order parameter by the step - function , @xmath61 .",
    "we can obtain the green s function @xmath62 on a trajectory inside n that is constant .",
    "it depends only on the length of that trajectory @xmath46 and the phase difference @xmath44 , which is given by @xmath63 \\ .",

    "( [ jc : eq5 ] ) ) .    the supercurrent density can then be obtained by averaging ( [ jc : eq8 ] ) over all different possible classical trajectories .",
    "this corresponds to an averaging over fermi velocity directions . in the presence of the planar magnetic field",
    ", we find @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the density of states at the fermi surface and @xmath66 denotes the imaginary part of the normal component of the matrix green s function , given by @xmath67    to calculate the integral of the vector potential along the quasiclassical trajectories , we split it into the segments as shown in fig .",
    "[ mzbfig1 ] , @xmath68 for the first term of the right side , we can write @xmath69 since the equation for this segment of the trajectory is @xmath70 , we get for the integral @xmath71 where @xmath72 is shown in fig . [ mzbfig1 ] .",
    "similarly , we find identical results for the integrals of the vector potential over the other segments .",
    "therefore for a trajectory with the length @xmath46 , the phase induced by the planar magnetic field proportional to @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of the triangles ( each triangle consists of two segments ) for the trajectory of the length @xmath46 passing through the point @xmath75 , @xmath76 + [ l/(4d\\tan\\theta\\sin\\phi)+z/(2d)]+2 $ ] , with the square brackets denoting the integer part .",

    "equation ( [ jc : eq16 ] ) expresses the magnetic interference pattern @xmath2 of a ballistic sns junction in the presence of an in - plane magnetic flux @xmath3 . in this section",
    "we analyze @xmath2 in terms of the length - to - thickness ratio @xmath4 and the temperature @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "let us start with analyzing the case of very large @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ mzbfig2 ] a , b shows oscillations of @xmath2 for @xmath94 and at low ( @xmath95 ) and high ( @xmath96 ) temperatures , respectively . at low temperatures",
    "the the critical current goes through nonzero minima at finite fluxes .",
    "the amplitude of supercurrent minima decrease with @xmath3 and drops to zero at @xmath97 . compared to an ordinary magnetic interference pattern ,",
    "the oscillations are weakly damped since their amplitude decreases with @xmath3 much slower than as @xmath98 . with increasing temperature",
    ", the amplitude of the oscillations decreases .",
    "also , the minimal values of the supercurrent decreases and vanishes as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",
    "note that at both low and high temperatures the period of oscillations varies from @xmath101 ( first minima ) at low magnetic fluxes to @xmath5 at high fluxes .",
    "the result that the period of oscillations is temperature independent comes from the fact that the gauge invariant phase in the argument of the sine and cosine functions in eq . ( [ jc : eq16 ] ) does not contain any temperature - dependent factors .",
    "figure [ mzbfig3 ] presents the magnetic interference pattern for a lower @xmath102 and at the same temperatures as figure [ mzbfig2 ] . from these plots we see that lowering @xmath4 has two main effects .",
    "first , the rate at which the amplitude of @xmath9 oscillation decreases with @xmath3 increases .",
    "second , the period of oscillations at both low and high temperatures becomes smaller @xmath103 at small fluxes .",
    "increasing @xmath3 the period increases up to @xmath104 .",
    "again as in figs .",
    "[ mzbfig2 ] the value of supercurrent at the minima vanishes as the temperature approaches @xmath105",
    ".    still lower period of oscillations at small fluxes can be reached at low values of @xmath4 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mzbfig4 ] where the magnetic interference pattern is presented for @xmath106 .",
    "clearly the decay is close to the ordinary pattern ( [ fraunhofer ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath98 , and the period can be as small as half the flux quantum .",
    "the existence of the nonzero minima in the oscillations of @xmath2 is related to the non - sinusoidal phase dependence of the josephson current ( [ jc : eq16 ] ) which is more pronounced at low temperatures @xmath107 .",
    "we have found that @xmath2 undergoes a change of sign at a nonzero minimum . at such point",
    "the amplitude of the first harmonic ( @xmath108 ) of the josephson current vanishes and @xmath2 is determined by the amplitude of the higher ( mainly second ) harmonics which change sign upon crossing the minimum .",
    "similar effect was found before in ferromagnetic josephson junctions ( see ref . - and references therein ) . as @xmath92 approaches",
    "@xmath105 the ratio @xmath109 goes to zero and the current - phase relation ( eq .",
    "( [ jc : eq16 ] ) ) becomes sinusoidal and consequently the nonzero minima disappear .",
    "the dependence of the period of the oscillations on the magnetic flux and the geometry can be understood in terms of the difference between the magnetic flux @xmath110 ( eq . ( [ jc : eq14 ] ) ) enclosed by a trajectory of length @xmath46 , and half of the flux @xmath3 penetrating through the area @xmath111 .",
    "the difference comes from the fact that a trajectory which does not pass through the edges of s contacts has extra parts in n - layer which lie outside the area @xmath111 ( see fig .",
    "[ mzbfig1 ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath112 , the difference @xmath113 vanishes only for the trajectories which pass through the edges of s contacts .",
    "a finite averaged @xmath114 over different trajectories means that the period of @xmath2-oscillations , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ jc : eq16 ] ) , differs from @xmath5 .",
    "we note that in the limit of thin n - layer @xmath115 or high magnetic fluxes @xmath116 the contribution of the trajectories which are not passing through the edges is negligibly small in the interference structure and the period of the oscillation approaches @xmath5 ( see figs .",
    "[ mzbfig2]-[mzbfig4 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath117 case , for smaller @xmath4 the contribution of the trajectories not passing through the edges is important . because of having larger length , a trajectory not passing through the edges has bigger contribution in gaining the effect of the magnetic flux as compared to the corresponding trajectory ( having the same orientation @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) passing through the edges .",
    "therefore we expect that the effect of magnetic flux is more pronounced for thicker n layers compare to the thinner ones , which explains why the decrease of the amplitude of @xmath2-oscillations with @xmath3 is faster for smaller @xmath4 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied josephson effect in a sns structure made of a thin ballistic n - layer of thickness @xmath0 on which two superconducting electrodes are deposited at the distance @xmath1 between each other .",
    "a magnetic field is applied in plane of the n - layer which modulates the superconducting interference and leads to a decaying oscillatory variation of the critical supercurrent @xmath2 with the magnetic flux @xmath3 . using the quasiclassical green s functions approach ,",
    "we have shown that such a magnetic interference pattern has three main differences with that of an ordinary pattern .",
    "first , at low temperatures the oscillations of the critical current @xmath2 go through the minima at which the supercurrent has nonzero values .",
    "second , for a large @xmath4 the amplitude of the quasi - periodic oscillations of @xmath2 decays at a rate which is much slower than @xmath6 .",
    "third , at low magnetic fluxes the oscillations can have a period smaller than the magnetic quantum flux @xmath5 depending on @xmath4 .",
