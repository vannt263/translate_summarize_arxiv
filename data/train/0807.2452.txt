    "the mass function ( mf ) is a fundamental property of stellar systems , describing the number of stars as a function of stellar mass .",
    "the mf is thus a statistical measure of the end result of the star formation process . succinctly characterizing a stellar population",
    ", the mf also informs our understanding of the structure and dynamical evolution of stellar clusters , the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "the first measurement of the mf was conducted by @xcite ; for higher mass stars , this seminal result remains essentially unchanged to the present day .",
    "salpeter found that the mf can be fit as a power law , formally expressed as :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 2.35 is known as the ` salpeter slope ' .",
    "power law mfs which find a larger fraction of low - mass stars have larger values of alpha and are expressed as being ` steeper ' , while mass functions that find a lower fraction of low - mass stars have smaller values of @xmath5 and are described as ` flatter ' .",
    "other functional forms have been suggested to characterize the mf .",
    "in particular , a number of investigators @xcite present log normal mfs , which can be expressed as    @xmath8    whichever functional form they adopt , most studies agree that the stellar mf appears to reach a peak at a few tenths of a solar mass .",
    "power law characterizations of the mf require a flattening from a salpeter slope for m @xmath9 1 m@xmath3 to @xmath100.51.7 below 1  @xmath11 , while @xcite finds a log - normal mf with a characteristic mass of m@xmath4=0.2 is required to reproduce the stellar mf for a volume complete sample in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we refer the reader to comprehensive reviews by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for a more detailed understanding of the vast literature devoted to measuring the stellar mf .",
    "several processes have been advanced to explain the shape of the mf ; examples include gravitational fragmentation @xcite , competitive accretion @xcite , truncation of mass accretion due to radiative or dynamical feedback @xcite , star - star interactions @xcite and the primordial distribution of clump masses within molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of each mechanism is influenced by physical variables , such as the metallicity and magnetic field strength of the parent molecular cloud , the local stellar density , and the intensity of the surrounding radiation field .",
    "these effects may ultimately result in observable mf variations as a function of environment , but at present the observed variations can be largely attributed to uncertainties arising from finite sample sizes and systematic differences in methodology @xcite , though intriguing signs of mf variations with environment may be emerging ( e.g. , taurus ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "previous studies of the galactic disk mf have been limited , however , to samples of a few thousand low - mass stars ( with low - mass stars defined for the purposes of this paper as m@xmath12 0.7 m@xmath3 ) , due to the inability to simultaneously obtain a deep and wide photometric sample .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) photometry of low - mass stars shows monotonic behavior across a wide range of colors .",
    "the accurate , multi - color catalogs produced by sdss and 2mass thereby allow the identification and characterization of millions of low - mass stars in the local galactic neighborhood , enlarging previous photometric samples of field low - mass dwarfs by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the statistical power of such a sample makes an sdss/2mass catalog of low - mass dwarfs a promising avenue for improving our measurement of the low - mass stellar luminosity and mass functions .    to test and calibrate this technique before applying it to the entirety of the sdss and 2mass databases",
    ", we have performed a combined photometric and spectroscopic study of nearly 30,000 stars detected in @xmath030 square degrees of overlap between the sdss and 2mass footprints .",
    "we describe in  [ merge ] the construction of this sample by matching the sdss , 2mass , and guide star catalog ( gsc ) photometric databases . in  [ specsec : overall ] we present the spectroscopic follow - up of more than a third of the sample .",
    "we verify the completeness limit of the photometric sample in  4 , where we also analyze the spectroscopic sample to understand the level of contamination and bias within the photometric catalog .",
    "we use this photometric catalog to measure the luminosity function of low - mass stars in the galactic neighborhood in  5 , derive a measurement of the low - mass stellar mass function in  6 , and summarize our conclusions in  7 . an appendix to this work",
    "presents native or transformed sdss photometry for stars with measured trigonometric parallaxes , useful for constraining the empirical sdss/2mass color - magnitude relation applied in  5 .",
    "we note that a full and complete description of our analysis necessarily results in a rather lengthy paper ; we therefore suggest that many readers may wish to skip directly to  5 & 6 to concentrate upon the core scientific findings of this work , and then return to read  2 , 3 & 4 if a deeper understanding of the assembly of the photometric sample and the effects of incompleteness , contamination and bias is desired .",
    "we analyzed sdss , 2mass , and gsc photometry for objects lying within a ` calibration region ' defined as the area between right ascensions ( @xmath5 ) of 3 and 15 degrees and declinations ( @xmath13 ) of -1.25 to + 1.25 degrees .",
    "an abnormally large number of sdss spectra of point sources were obtained in this region , allowing a test of the efficiency and robustness of the photometric sample assembled here ( see  [ specsec : sdss ] ) .",
    "we excluded a small area [ 13.1 @xmath14 13.3 , @xmath15 -1.05 ] surrounding hd5112 , a bright ( v = 4.77 ) m0 giant , which badly saturates sdss photometry over a large area .",
    "the area of the calibration region thus subtends 29.957 square degrees on the sky .",
    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides a homogeneous catalog in three near infrared filters ( @xmath16 ) ranging from 1 to 2.4 @xmath17 m .",
    "we queried the 2mass all sky data release @xcite via the gator interface for all objects detected within the calibration region , retaining only objects with :    * astrometric location within the boundaries of the calibration region ; * high quality @xmath18 band photometry ( jphqual flag @xmath19 ` a ' or jrdflag @xmath19 ` 1 ' or ` 3 ' ) ; * unique detections of catalog objects ( use - src flag @xmath19 ` 1 ' ) ; * point source morphology ( ext - key @xmath19 ` null ' ) ; * no association with the predicted location of a known minor planet , comet , planet or planetary satellite ( mp_flg @xmath19 0 ) .",
    "these selection criteria generate a sample of 30,449 stellar candidates with ir detections within the calibration region .",
    "the initial mission of the sdss was to map a quarter of the night sky centered on the north galactic cap , acquiring accurate photometry of 100 million objects in 5 filters @xcite and accumulating over 1 million spectra @xcite .",
    "this mission is now complete , with over 9000 square degrees of photometry and over 1.25 million spectra released to the public in data release 6 @xcite .",
    "sdss observations were obtained with a dedicated 2.5 meter telescope at the apache point observatory @xcite .",
    "photometric data were acquired as the telescope s 3 degree field imaged in 5 filters ( @xmath20,@xmath21,@xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24 ) nearly simultaneously by scanning a great circle across the sky at approximately the sidereal rate .",
    "photometric data were reduced by a custom sdss data processing pipeline ( photo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with calibrations obtained from observations by a 20-inch photometric telescope at the same site @xcite .",
    "the article describing the early data release @xcite provides information on the central wavelengths and widths of the sdss filters , while papers discussing the `` asinh '' magnitude system @xcite and the sdss standard star system @xcite provide further information on the calibration of the sdss photometric system . astrometric precision and data quality assurance",
    "are also described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assembled a catalog of stellar sdss sources within the calibration region from imaging data first made public as data release 2 @xcite .",
    "sdss stellar candidates satisfied the following criteria :    * sdss astrometric location within 0.005 degrees ( 15 - 20 @xmath25 ) of the calibration region ( to allow matches for 2mass objects whose proper motion may have carried them slightly out of the calibration region by the time of the sdss imaging epoch ) ; * observed during a run which passed basic data quality tests ( good flag set ) ; * object represents the primary detection in the sdss photometric database ( primary flag set ) to prevent multiple detections from overlap areas between adjacent sdss runs ; * morphological identification as a point source ( type = 6 ) . * @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes above survey completeness limits ( @xmath26 21.1 , @xmath27 20.3 ) ; * no photometric processing flaws to ensure accurate photometry ( saturated flag not set in either @xmath22 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 , peakcenter flag not set , notchecked flag not set , deblend - nopeak flag not set for an object with @xmath23 psf error @xmath9 0.2 magnitudes , psf - flux - interp flag not set , bad - counts - error flag not set , interp - center and cr flags not both set ) ;    these selection criteria identified 76,966 high quality sdss detections of stellar candidates within this region ; the last set of quality cuts removed 1486 stellar candidates , or @xmath01.9% of the initial stellar catalog .",
    "we note a subtle source of uncertainty in the sdss @xmath24 band photometry which may be of more importance for this study than for most other uses of the sdss database .",
    "spectral synthesis of l and t dwarfs ( burgasser , private communication ) indicates that slight differences in the spectral response of the ccd detectors used for the @xmath24 band observations can introduce @xmath24 magnitude variations up to 0.1 mags for early l through late t dwarfs . as we lack a robust characterization of this effect , and the vast majority of our sample is composed of k and m dwarfs for which this source of uncertainty is less important , we have not applied any z - band corrections to the survey photometry .",
    "the depth of the sdss comes at the expense of a relatively faint saturation limit of @xmath28 14 .",
    "this fixed apparent magnitude limit imposes a lower limit on the distance to sdss stars with good photometric detections , and this distance limit is itself a function of the absolute magnitude of the star .",
    "typical m0 dwarfs within 100 parsecs are saturated in sdss imaging , for example , while m8 dwarfs only saturate in @xmath23 for distances less than 10 parsecs .",
    "the 2mass faint limit , however , restricted our sample to objects within 100 parsecs for objects of type m8 and later . constructing a luminosity function of stars detected in both sdss and 2mass then required that early and late m dwarfs be sampled from disjoint physical volumes . as the calibration region is located at a galactic latitude of -62 degrees , this could potentially have introduced a bias in our analysis related to the scale height of the galactic disk .    to include stars with saturated sdss imaging in our catalog , we made use of gsc ( version 2.2 ) optical photometry .",
    "the gsc @xcite is based on scans of photographic plates from the palomar and uk schmidt telescopes and provides star / galaxy morphological classification from measurements of 500 million objects in photographic @xmath29 ( as defined by * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath30 4500  ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath30 6500  ) to a completeness limit of @xmath32 18.5 .",
    "we assembled a catalog of gsc ( version 2.2 ) objects brighter than a magnitude of 19.5 using the gsc data access page , which we searched for morphological point sources ( gsc classification code @xmath19 0 ) .",
    "these criteria identified 33,612 stellar candidates with gsc detections within the calibration region .      to generate a comprehensive optical / near - infrared catalog of calibration region stars , we have merged the 2mass , sdss , and gsc stellar samples into a single matched catalog .",
    "as 2mass photometry provides our only source of infrared observations , only objects with 2mass detections were retained .",
    "2mass stars were matched to sdss and gsc counterparts using a maximum matching radius of 5 .",
    "we required unique matches  if an optical source was a potential counterpart for multiple nir sources , only the closest association was preserved .",
    "of the 30,499 2mass sources in the calibration region , 19,617 possessed both sdss and gsc stellar counterparts .",
    "an additional 5265 and 4608 2mass detections were identified with only a gsc or sdss stellar counterpart , respectively .",
    "the final 959 2mass stellar candidates ( @xmath0 3% of the input 2mass sample ) were not matched to counterparts in either optical catalog .",
    "of these unmatched sources , 606 have 15.2 @xmath33 16.3 , and 753 have @xmath34 ; given the @xmath35 completeness limit of our catalog ( see  [ quality : completelimit ] ) , this indicates that the bulk of these unmatched sources lie at the faint end of our sample , but still are confident detections .",
    "visual analysis of sdss imaging of the 753 @xmath34 sources identified 73% ( 550/753 ) as galaxies : these objects were unresolved by 2mass imaging , but resolved by the optical surveys , and were therefore not contained in the sdss and gsc stellar catalogs .",
    "the remaining 203 unmatched 2mass sources brighter than @xmath36 16.3 were stellar sources , dominated by sources too faint for the gsc catalog and with sub - optimal sdss photometry , and therefore excluded by the quality cuts described in ",
    "[ photsec : sdss ] .",
    "as these unmatched stellar sources represent a possible source of incompleteness in our final sample , we explore their properties in more detail in  [ quality : completelimit ] .",
    "the 19,617 sources in common between the sdss and gsc catalogs allowed an assessment of zero point errors in the gsc data .",
    "we calculated synthetic gsc magnitudes for sdss sources using equations originally derived by @xcite , modified to account for local zero - point offsets :    @xmath37    @xmath38    the shape of the calibration region , 12 degrees wide in right ascension and only 2.5 degrees across in declination , implies that spatial gradients in imaging quality in right ascension are more important than gradients in declination , an expectation borne out in our dataset .",
    "the top panel of figure [ photfig : rawresidualsra ] shows residuals between observed and synthetic gsc magnitudes as a function of right ascension . assuming that the digital , drift - scanned sdss data has a uniform zero point across the calibration region",
    ", these residuals reflect changes in photographic sensitivity across poss plates .",
    "this expectation is supported by sharp discontinuities in the residuals on 5 degree spatial scales , the size of the poss plates from which gsc magnitudes are measured .",
    "magnitudes calculated from sdss photometry as a function of @xmath5 b efore ( top ) and after ( bottom ) recalibration with sdss - based zero - points .",
    "the structure on 5 degree spatial scales in the top panel suggests that gsc magnitudes , measured fr om digitized poss plates 5 degrees in size , contain systematic zero - point errors of the same order as the random photometric errors .",
    ", height=384 ]    to correct for spatial variations in the gsc zero point , we calculated the mean offset between synthetic and observed gsc magnitudes in 0.25 degree bins of right ascension . applying this offset to all objects in that spatial bin produces recalibrated @xmath29 and @xmath31 magnitudes , corrected for the presence of the known zero - point error .",
    "though these systematic zeropoint offsets are largely a function of right ascension , we have also repeated this process using 0.1 degrees bins in declination .",
    "the result of this recalibration is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure [ photfig : rawresidualsra ] , which shows that large scale spatial gradients in the residuals have been removed .",
    "we adopt characteristic errors for the recalibrated gsc magnitudes based on the remaining residuals between the recalibrated and synthetic gsc magnitudes .",
    "gaussian errors with @xmath390.13 accurately describe the recalibrated @xmath29 residuals across the entirety of the calibration region .",
    "the recalibrated @xmath31 residuals are well described by a gaussian distribution with @xmath39 0.1 magnitudes for @xmath40 8.2 ; at @xmath41 8.2 , @xmath420.15 is required to fit the bulk of the sources , and a tail of sources with large errors is still present .",
    "we thus conservatively assign errors of 0.2 magnitudes to recalibrated @xmath29 magnitudes , and 0.15 magnitudes to recalibrated @xmath31 magnitudes .",
    "given the increased uncertainty of the @xmath31 magnitudes for @xmath43 8.2 degrees , we rely largely on @xmath29 magnitudes in conducting our analysis .      measuring the luminosity and mass functions from photometric observations of the galactic field requires the adoption of a color - magnitude relation to estimate the absolute magnitude , and ultimately mass , of each star .",
    "we used @xmath44 for this purpose , as @xcite have demonstrated that this color is a monotonic indicator of spectral type , and therefore temperature and luminosity , for late type dwarfs .    to create a sample of uniform @xmath44 colors for the full photometric sample , we derived synthetic @xmath44 colors for objects with observed @xmath45 colors .",
    "figure [ photfig : jjij ] shows the @xmath45 and @xmath44 colors for sources detected in both optical surveys . interpolating the @xmath45 colors of our sample onto the median trend of @xmath44 as a function of @xmath45",
    ", we assigned each gsc/2mass object that lacked bona fide sdss data a synthetic @xmath44 color .",

    "and @xmath44 colors for objects observed in both optical catalogs shown as black points and contours .",
    "the median @xmath44 colors measured for 0.1 magnitude bins of @xmath45 color are shown as triangles ; the dashed line shows the function used to assign synthetic @xmath44 colors as a function of @xmath45 color to sources that lack sdss data ( e.g. , saturated).,height=288 ]    using the same methodology , we also derived synthetic @xmath46 and @xmath47 colors for all gsc sources with @xmath45 colors . for gsc sources with only @xmath31 magnitudes , we calculated the full suite of synthetic sdss colors ( @xmath44 , @xmath47 , @xmath46 ) using the same technique as applied to observed @xmath48 colors .",
    "this minimizes the impact of the poorly recalibrated @xmath31 photometry on our sample : only 232 objects are detected only in @xmath31 ; all other sources have either native sdss colors or synthetic colors generated from an observed @xmath45 color .",
    "we assembled an extensive database of follow - up spectroscopy to test for contamination ( e.g. , background giants , mis - identified qsos , etc . ) and bias ( e.g. , systemic misclassification of numerous m2 dwarfs as rarer m6 dwarfs due to dim , noisy photometry ) in our photometrically selected sample of low - mass stars .",
    "sdss spectroscopic observations were made with twin fiber - fed spectrographs , covering wavelengths from 3800  to 9200   with a spectral resolution of @xmath49 @xmath0 1800 .",
    "each fiber was 3  in diameter and plugged into a pre - drilled metal plate allowing observations across the 3 degree field of view of the sdss telescope .",
    "a single plate accomodated 640 fibers , with 320 going to each spectrograph .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic pipeline performed automated data reduction , producing flux calibrated spectra corrected for telluric absorption .",
    "each autumn , when the north galactic cap was completely inaccessable from apache point observatory , sdss - i focused its attention on an area along the celestial equator known as the southern equatorial stripe , or stripe 82 .",
    "the observational projects conducted in stripe 82 with the sdss instruments during the autumn observing seasons included repeat imaging to allow investigations of sdss data quality and to conduct time variability studies , as well as stand - alone observing programs proposed by collaboration scientists which had different targeting algorithms and data quality benchmarks than standard survey operations .",
    "data products generated by these observing programs were released as part of dr4 , and are described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "these additional datasets motivated us to place our calibration region in stripe 82 , as they contain thousands of stars with spectroscopic observations .",
    "particularly useful to us were the slomass and ` spectra of everything ' samples , described in full by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we identified stars in our sample with sdss spectra using a 2  matching radius between the position of each spectral fiber and the 2mass position of each photometric object .",
    "due largely to the two observing programs mentioned above , 10,784 stars in the calibration region , or more than a third of our matched sample , have an sdss spectrum .      for two areas within the calibration region , covering one square degree in total , we acquired complete spectroscopic samples of low - mass stellar candidates .",
    "we refer to these areas as ` complete region 1 ' ( 4.19 @xmath14 5.32 , -1.04 @xmath50 -0.58 ) and ` complete region 2 ' ( 11.68 @xmath14 12.31 , -0.24 @xmath50 + 0.8 ) , and the union of the two as the ` main complete ' sample .",
    "the ` main complete ' samples include candidate late type dwarfs satisfying the following criteria :    * 2mass astrometric positions within the boundaries of complete region 1 or 2 ; * 2mass photometry meeting the criteria expressed in  [ photsec:2mass ] , and @xmath51 16 ; * sdss or gsc counterparts meeting the selection criteria outlined in ",
