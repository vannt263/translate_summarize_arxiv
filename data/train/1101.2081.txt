    "biological evolution is a complex phenomenon driven by various processes , such as muation and recombination of genetic material , reproduction of individuals , and selection of favourable types .",
    "the area of _ population genetics _ is concerned with how these processes shape and change the genetic structure of populations . _",
    "mathematical population genetics _ was founded in the 1920 s by ronald fisher , sewall wright , and john haldane , and thus is among the oldest areas of mathematical biology .",
    "the reason for its continuing ( and actually increasing ) attractiveness for both mathematicians and biologists is at least twofold : firstly , there is a true need for mathematical models and methods , since the outcome of evolution is impossible to predict ( and , thus , today s genetic data are impossible to analyse ) without their help .",
    "second , the processes of genetics lend themselves most naturally to a mathematical formulation and give rise to a wealth of fascinating new problems , concepts , and methods",
    ".    this contribution will focus on the phenomenon of _ recombination _ , in which two parent individuals are involved in creating the mixed type of their offspring during sexual reproduction .",
    "the essence of this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifecycle ] and may be idealised and summarised as follows .",
    "life cycle of a population under sexual reproduction and recombination .",
    "each line symbolises a sequence of sites that defines a gamete ( like the two at the top that start the cycle as ` egg ' and ` sperm ' ) .",
    "the pool of gametes at the left and the right comes from a large population of recombining individuals .",
    "these sequences meet randomly to start the next round of the cycle . ]",
    "genetic information is encoded in terms of sequences of finite length .",
    "eggs and sperm ( i.e. , female and male germ cells or _ gametes _ ) each carry a single copy of such a sequence .",
    "they go through the following life cycle : at fertilisation , two gametes meet randomly and unite , thus starting the life of a new individual , which is equipped with both the maternal and the paternal sequence . at maturity , this individual will generate its own germ cells .",
    "this process includes recombination , that is , the maternal and paternal sequences perform one or more _ crossovers _ and are cut and relinked accordingly , so that two ` mixed ' sequences emerge . these are the new gametes and start the next round of fertilisation ( by random mating within a large population ) .    models of this process aim at describing the dynamics of the genetic composition of a population that goes through this life cycle repeatedly .",
    "these models come in various flavours : in discrete or continous time ; with various assumptions about the crossover pattern ; and , most importantly , in a deterministic or a stochastic formulation , depending on whether the population is assumed to be so large that stochastic fluctuations may be neglected . in any case , however , the resulting process appears difficult to treat , due to the large number of possible states and the nonlinearity generated by the random mixture of gametes .",
    "nevertheless , a number of solution procedures have been discovered for the deterministic discrete - time setting @xcite , and the underlying mathematical structures were investigated within the framework of genetic algebras , see @xcite .",
    "quite generally , the solution relies on a certain nonlinear transformation ( known as haldane linearisation ) from ( gamete or type ) frequencies to suitable correlation functions , which decouple from each other and decay geometrically .",
    "but if sequences of more than three sites are involved , this transformation must be constructed via recursions that involve the parameters of the recombination process , and is not available explicitly except in the trivial case of independent sites . for a review of the area , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "v.4 ) .    in this contribution",
    ", we concentrate on a special case that is both biologically and mathematically relevant , namely , the situation in which at most one crossover happens at any given time .",
    "that is , only recombination events may occur that partition the sites of a sequence into two parts that correspond to the sites before and after a given crossover point .",
    "we analyse the resulting models in continuous time ( both deterministic and stochastic ) , as well as in discrete time . for the deterministic continuous - time system ( section  [ sec : det_cont ] ) , a simple explicit solution can be given .",
    "this simplicity is due to some underlying linearity ; actually , the system may even be diagonalised ( via a _ nonlinear _ transformation ) . in section  [ sec : stoch_cont ] , we consider the corresponding stochastic process ( still in continuous time ) , namely , the moran model with recombination .",
    "this also takes into account the resampling effect that comes about via random reproduction in a finite population .",
    "in particular , we investigate the relationship between the expectation of the moran model and the solution of the deterministic continuous - time model .",
    "we finally tackle deterministic single - crossover dynamics in _ discrete _ time ( section  [ sec : det_discr ] ) .",
    "this setting implies additional dependencies , which become particularly transparent when the so - called _ ancestral recombination process _",
    ". a solution may still be given , but its coefficients must be determined recursively .    altogether , it will turn out that the corresponding models , and their analysis , have various mathematical facettes that are intertwined with each other , such as differential equations , probability theory , and combinatorics .",
    "we describe populations at the level of their gametes and thus identify gametes with individuals .",
    "their genetic information is encoded in terms of a linear arrangement of sites , indexed by the set @xmath0 .",
    "for each site @xmath1 , there is a set @xmath2 of ` letters ' that may possibly occur at that site . to allow for a convenient notation",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the simple but important case of _ finite _ sets @xmath2 ; for the full generality of arbitrary locally compact spaces @xmath2 , the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite .    a _ type _ is thus defined as a sequence @xmath3 where @xmath4 is called the _",
    "type space_. by construction , @xmath5 is the @xmath6-th coordinate of @xmath7 , and we define @xmath8 as the collection of coordinates with indices in @xmath9 , where @xmath9 is a subset of @xmath10 . a _ population _ is identified with a non - negative measure @xmath11 on @xmath4 .",
    "namely , @xmath12 denotes the frequency of individuals of type @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 ; we abbreviate @xmath12 as @xmath16 .",
    "the set of all nonnegative measures on @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "if we define @xmath18 as the point measure on @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath19 for @xmath20 ) , we can also write @xmath21 . we may , alternatively , interpret @xmath18 as the basis vector of @xmath22 that corresponds to @xmath7 ( where a suitable ordering of types is implied , and @xmath23 is the number of elements in @xmath4 ) ; @xmath11 is thus identified with a vector in @xmath22 .    at this stage , frequencies need not be normalised ; @xmath16 may simply be thought of as the size of the subpopulation of type @xmath7 , measured in units so large that it may be considered a continuous quantity .",
    "the corresponding normalised version @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the total population size ) is then a probability distribution on @xmath4 , and may be identified with a probability vector .",
    "recombination acts on the links between the sites ; the links are collected into the set @xmath26 .",
    "we shall use latin indices for the sites and greek indices for the links , and the implicit rule will always be that @xmath27 is the link between sites @xmath6 and @xmath28 ; see figure  [ fig : sitesandlinks ] .     sites and links . ]",
    "let recombination happen in every individual , and at every link @xmath29 , at rate @xmath30 .",
    "more precisely , for every @xmath29 , every individual exchanges , at rate @xmath31 , the sites after link @xmath32 with those of a randomly chosen partner . explicitly , if the ` active ' and the partner individual are of types @xmath7 and @xmath33 , then the new pair has types @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the largest integer below @xmath32 ( the smallest above @xmath32 ) ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : reco ] .",
    "since every individual can occur as either the ` active ' individual or as its randomly chosen partner , we have a total rate of @xmath37 for crossovers at link @xmath32 . for later use",

    "lower panel : the corresponding ` marginalised ' version that summarises all events by which individuals of type @xmath7 are gained or lost ( a ` @xmath39 ' at site @xmath6 stands for an arbitrary element of @xmath2 ) .",
    "note that , in either case , the process can go both ways , as indicated by the arrows . ]    in order to formulate the corresponding model , let us introduce the projection operators @xmath40 , @xmath41 , via @xmath42 i.e. , @xmath40 is the canonical projection to the @xmath6-th coordinate . likewise , for any index set @xmath43 ,",
    "one defines a projector @xmath44 we shall frequently use the abbreviations @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as well as @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the projectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 may be thought of as _ cut and forget _ operators because they take the leading or trailing segment of a sequence @xmath7 , and forget about the rest .    whereas the @xmath51 act on the types , we also need the induced mapping at the level of the population , namely , @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the preimage under @xmath51",

    ", @xmath56 is the marginal frequency of sequences prescribed at the sites before @xmath32 , and vice versa for the sites after @xmath32 .",
    "now , single - crossover recombination ( at the level of the population ) means the relinking of a randomly chosen leading segment with a randomly chosen trailing segment .",
    "we therefore introduce ( elementary ) recombination operators ( or _ recombinators _ , for short ) , @xmath57 for @xmath29 , defined by @xmath58 here , the tensor product reflects the independent combination ( i.e. , the product measure ) of the two marginals @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "note also that , as @xmath81 , @xmath82 converges to the stationary state @xmath83 in which all sites are independent .",
    "the simplicity of the solution in theorem  [ thm : sol ] comes as a certain surprise .",

    "let us introduce the following abbreviations : @xmath177 and , for each @xmath99 , @xmath178 furthermore , we set @xmath179 .",

    "the above iteration is easily understood intuitively : a type @xmath7 resulting from recombination at link @xmath32 is composed of two segments @xmath155 and @xmath157 .",
    "these segments themselves may have been pieced together in previous recombination events already , and the iteration explains the possible cuts these segments may carry along .",
    "the first term in the product stands for the type delivering the leading segment ( which may bring along arbitrary cuts in the trailing segment ) , the second for the type delivering the trailing one ( here any leading segment is allowed ) . the term @xmath183 covers the case of no recombination .",
    "let us now have a closer look at the structure of the dependence between links in discrete time . to this end ,",
    "note first that the set @xmath184 with @xmath185 partitions @xmath186 into @xmath187 , where @xmath188 cutting all links in @xmath79 decomposes the original system ( of sites and links ) into subsystems which are independent of each other from then on .",

    "indeed , it may be shown ( and will be detailed in a forthcoming paper ) that the coefficient functions have the form @xmath201 where the upper index has again been added to indicate the dependence on the system .",

    "our restriction to single crossovers provided a starting point with a uniquely transparent structure ( mainly due to the independence of links in continuous time ) .",
    "however , arbitrary recombination patterns ( which partition the set of links into two _ arbitrary _ parts ) can also be dealt with , as has been done for the deterministic case in @xcite . the underlying mathematical structure will be further investigated in a forthcoming paper , for both the deterministic and the stochastic models .    above , genetic material",
    "was exchanged reciprocally at recombination events , so that the length of each sequence remains constant . but",
    "sequences may also shift relative to each other before cutting and relinking ( so - called _ unequal crossover _ ) , which entails changes in length , see @xcite and references therein for more .",
    "the most important aspect of modern population genetics is the backward - in - time point of view .",
    "this is natural because evolution is mainly a historical science and today s researchers try to infer the past from samples of individuals taken from present - day populations .",
    "we have hinted at this with our version of an ancestral recombination process , but would like to emphasise that this is only a toy version .",
    "the full version of this process also takes into account resampling ( as in sec .",
    "[ sec : stoch_cont ] , with @xmath207 ) and aims at the law of _ genealogies _ of _ samples _ from _ finite _ populations .",
    "this point of view was introduced by hudson @xcite .",
    "the fundamental concept here is the _ ancestral recombination graph _ :",
    "a branching - coalescing graph , where branching ( backwards in time ) comes about by recombination ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ancestral ] ) , but lines may also coalesce where two individuals go back to a common ancestor ( this corresponds to a resampling event forward in time ) . for recent introductions into this topic ,",

    "last not least , recombination and resampling are but two of the various processes that act on genes in populations",
    ". further inclusion of mutation and/or selection leads to a wealth of challenging problems , whose investigation has stimulated the exploration of new mathematical structures , concepts , and methods ; let us only mention @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as recent examples .",
