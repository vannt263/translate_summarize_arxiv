    "inflation @xcite is an early phase of accelerated expansion which apart from solving shortcomings of the big bang cosmology , such as the horizon and flatness problems , also provides a natural mechanism to seed the primordial inhomogeneities which grow into the structures we observe today @xcite .",
    "the basic predictions of inflationary paradigm such as approximate scale - invariance and gaussianity of primordial power spectrum are supported very well by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure data @xcite .",
    "inflationary cosmology has also been used as a testing ground of many alternative theories like lorentz violating theories @xcite , modified gravity theories @xcite and more recently some modified quantum theories @xcite in order to constrain them .",
    "the mechanism of generating the primordial inhomogeneities by inflation is essentially amplifying the quantum fluctuations of a scalar field .",
    "but the large scale structures like galaxies do behave like classical objects .",
    "this then leads us to the problem of understanding quantum to classical transition in the cosmological context which can be thought as a more serious form of the so - called ` quantum measurement problem ' .",
    "the key conceptual issue of quantum mechanics has been the appearance of deterministic outcomes in a measurement process one performs over a quantum system prepared in a superposed state .",
    "the quantum theory , if endowed with the copenhagen interpretation , suggests that a quantum state remains in a superposed state as long as no observer does a measurement on it .",
    "as soon as the observer performs a measurement on the quantum state , the interaction of the state with the classical measuring apparatus causes the quantum state to ` collapse ' into one of the eigenstates of the observable being measured by the apparatus .",
    "this age - old heuristic description has since been drastically refined with the understanding of the phenomenon of decoherence where the classical apparatus is coupled to an environment consisting of a very large number of degrees of freedom , which one is not concerned about in a measurement process @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued that the formalism of decoherence by itself does not solve the problem of a single outcome @xcite . for completion",
    ", decoherence must be supplemented with the formalism of many - worlds @xcite , thus making it debatable and possibly not acceptable to a section of the community .",
    "secondly this scheme relies heavily on a distinction between the ` environment ' and the ` system ' .",
    "therefore , this scheme does not naturally extend to closed systems such as the early universe .",
    "there have been other attempts dealing with these kind of issues such as bohmian mechanics @xcite but these do not by themselves predict a testable feature of the model which can be verified or refuted .",
    "as has been mentioned earlier , the problem of quantum measurement associated with the interpretation of quantum theory manifests itself also in the context of appearance of large scale structures such as galaxies and clusters in the universe .",
    "so the issue which becomes pertinent is : at what stage these fluctuations lose their quantum features to attain classical characteristics during the process of evolution ? and what is the mechanism which brings about this quantum - to - classical transition ?",
    "what we observe through cmbr is in a sense a measurement of the field variable @xcite and the definiteness in the result of the measurement indicates that the field eigenstates get selected as the privileged basis .",
    "decoherence has been suggested as a plausible framework to deal with these open problems @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be useful to work with a gauge invariant quantity known as the mukhanov - sasaki variable to study the evolution of the fluctuations .",
    "it is interesting to note that during the course of evolution the probability distribution of the mukhanov - sasaki variable gets highly squeezed @xcite in the phase space along momentum .",
    "it is shown that in this high squeezing limit the quantum expectations can be well mimicked by statistical average over a classical stochastic field @xcite . in this sense",
    ", one can study the evolution of these fluctuations through classical equations and take the fluctuations as classical for all practical purposes .",
    "this is clearly one facet of explaining the classical nature of the structures in the universe .",
    "moreover decoherence selects field eigenstates as the pointer basis and eventually one arrives at a diagonal density matrix which is a characteristic of classical systems .",
    "however , one can still ask the question analogous to the issue of ` macro - objectification ' in quantum mechanics i.e. how does a particular realization of the system get selected . furthermore , from the cmbr spectra we learn that selection of field eigenbasis as pointer basis and the collapse of the field in one of the field eigenbasis occurs at least as early as the epoch of recombination since the radiation essentially free - streams through the universe after recombination .",
    "cmbr encodes the signature of the initial density perturbations which started to grow after recombination .",
    "thus the cmb map , in a sense , carries information about a measurement of the field variable , which took place at least as early as recombination when there were no ` conscious observers ' to cause collapse .",
    "therefore , these interpretational issues , as we see , become very significant when applied to the early universe .",
    "classicalization by decoherence does not naturally extend to closed systems such as the early universe . as there were neither natural degrees of freedom to act as an ` environment ' nor observers who update their knowledge about the system , the schemes such as decoherence or state depicting the knowledge of an observer might seem inadequate to deal with the evolution of the universe .",
    "one possible way to approach interpretational issues such as the quantum measurement problem is to consider dynamically induced collapse of the wave - function .",
    "for instance , collapse may be induced by gravity , or by modifications of quantum theory .",
    "such modifications will have implications for inflationary dynamics , and their role in generating classical density perturbations has been analyzed extensively by sudarsky and collaborators @xcite .",
    "continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) is a phenomenological model which tries to address these interpretational issues related to the quantum theory @xcite . in this scheme one",
    "makes non - linear , non - hermitean stochastic modifications to the evolution equations otherwise governed by the hermitean hamiltonian .",
    "the defining feature of these corrections is that they drive the state to one of the eigenstates of position ( in the position driven models ) which is a description of localization .",
    "the quantum measurement process is understood in this framework with the understanding that any measurement is essentially a position measurement @xcite .",
    "one important aspect of the modifications is that they are very tiny for microscopic systems resulting in the longevity of the superposed states , while they grow substantially large for macroscopic systems ( the so - called amplification mechanism ) causing a quick and effective position localization of macroscopic objects .",
    "being a phenomenological modification of quantum theory , its parameters are constrained through studying the effects of such models on laboratory as well as cosmological situations @xcite . for a detailed introduction of this scheme the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .    although this scheme is phenomenological and only developed for non - relativistic systems , motivated by the features of this scheme martin _",
    "_ @xcite recently attempted a generalization of adding stochastic modification to quantum theory to study the evolution of the very early universe . as a relativistic generalization of csl",
    "has not yet been successfully achieved @xcite , in this case they introduce a csl - like correction in the functional schrdinger equation for evolution of mode functions .",
    "they show that this analysis is precisely equivalent to consideration of a harmonic oscillator with time dependent frequency in the original csl model .",
    "the motivation is to obtain classicalization for super - horizon modes in a single realization of the universe .",
    "however , for simplicity they primarily consider a model with a constant collapse strength parameter @xmath0 in mukhanov - sasaki variable driven collapse mechanism which lacks the mechanism of scale - dependent amplification as we will discuss below .",
    "the amplification mechanism in the non - relativistic collapse model ( which assumes @xmath0 to be mass - dependent ) causes the non - linear stochastic corrections to become dominant for macro - objects causing an effective and efficient collapse .",
    "the outcome of their analysis with constant @xmath0 model is that one does not obtain an efficient collapse of the field variable .",
    "moreover , they show that such modifications leave undesirable imprints on the power spectrum by making it scale - dependent .",
    "the requirement that these modes must reside outside the current cosmological horizon , motivated by the fact that the power spectrum we observe is scale invariant , constrains the parameter @xmath0 to exponentially suppressed values .",
    "although the time available for collapse process is sufficient with the constrained parameter , the suppressed value of the csl correction parameter @xmath0 makes the collapse inefficient as the width of localization is inversely related to @xmath0 .    this scheme adopted by martin _",
    "_ although certainly being a preliminary and interesting step towards obtaining the guiding principles for a field theoretic generalization of csl , has some limitations , in our opinion .",
    "the first and obvious one , as pointed out by them , is the lack of an amplification mechanism dependent on the relevant length scales . as discussed before ,",
    "the amplification mechanism is the source of different behavior of macro or micro - objects .",
    "one in general , does not expect an efficient collapse in the absence of this mechanism . had the collapse process without the amplification been still effective",
    ", one would be lead to the conclusion that modes with smallest length scales are as effectively classicalized as modes with large length scales rendering any quantum phenomenon for any length scale .",
    "therefore , it will be a natural demand to ask for a csl generalization which calls for a distinction between micro and macro modes ( ms variable ) driven or @xmath1 driven ( for some arbitrary function @xmath2 of the scale factor @xmath3 ) .",
    "both of these operators drive the field to an eigenstate of @xmath4 , with same probabilities .",
    "if we take the collapse being driven by @xmath1 with a constant @xmath0 , the analysis will be equivalent to a collapse process driven by @xmath4 with a time - dependent @xmath5 .",
    "thus the ambiguity in selecting the collapse operator translates into a time - dependent @xmath0 analysis . ] .",
    "secondly , one learns that such a scheme is capable of distorting the scale invariant power spectrum for the modes where the csl correction is dominating over the standard quantum evolution .",
    "furthermore , in normal csl scenario one expects an efficient collapse to occur in the above mentioned regime .",
    "thus when one suggests that the modes which distort the power spectrum lie outside the current horizon , one is lead to the argument that the modes physically relevant to us and within the horizon today are the ones least affected by csl modifications .",
    "however these are the modes which one sought to be classicalized by the csl mechanism , i.e. dominated by the csl modifications",
    ". thus one should ask for a mechanism which not only captures the amplification mechanism but also respects the observed scale invariant power spectrum .",
    "our scheme in this paper will be to constrain the class of csl type modifications in the spirit of martin _ et al .",
    "_ by consideration of the above mentioned criteria .",
    "we will see that the inefficiency of the constant @xmath0 models is manifested at the level of wigner function itself , even before constraining @xmath0 to a insignificantly small value when confronted with observations .",
    "as argued before , to take into account this discrepancy we will modify the csl parameter @xmath0 to carry information about different modes .",
    "we show that any time invariant model is as inefficient as a constant @xmath0 case for ms variable driven collapse .",
    "therefore , we introduce scale dependence in this parameter . in such a case , we observe that unless the scale dependence of @xmath0 is sufficiently strong there is no localization in the field variable .",
    "if the parameter lies in a certain allowed range then we obtain desired effective collapse in field eigenbasis in the superhorizon limit .",
    "we further constrain the model by considering the scale - invariance of the power spectrum .",
    "we show that a particular class of scale dependent models seems capable of meeting these requirements .",
    "further , the appearance of acoustic peaks in the cmbr map is a signature of phase coherence of primordial perturbations which appears very naturally in standard inflationary scenarios @xcite . in the class of collapse models which respect the scale - invariance of power spectrum",
    "we argue that the phase coherence is not destroyed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly introduce the inflationary perturbations in the standard framework in the heisenberg as well as schrdinger picture in section ii . here",
    "we also discuss the concept of squeezing and the understanding of classicalization through it . in section iii , we briefly review the csl model and discuss the models of constant @xmath0 ( as well as @xmath6 ) in inflationary context to study its effects on squeezing and power spectrum .",
    "section iv describes the introduction of amplification mechanism in the form of scale dependent @xmath0 model .",
    "we discuss its effect on power spectrum and constrain the models which respect the scale invariance of the power spectrum . in section",
    "v , we discuss the issue of phase coherence in the light of the csl type modification .",
    "we then summarize our main results in section vi and conclude .",
    "in general , the perturbations generated during inflation are studied in the heisenberg picture @xcite .",
    "we , on the other hand , need to study the evolution of these primordial perturbations in the schrdinger picture : this will help us incorporate the csl mechanism within the arena of inflation .",
    "these two representations of quantum fluctuations are equivalent and provide the same physical implications for the derived quantities . as the schrdinger picture of evolution of primordial fluctuations is less studied in the literature , we will recall here the evolution of mode functions in a generic inflationary scenario ( especially the squeezing of the modes ) in both the pictures ; this will help us relate the more conventional heisenberg picture analysis of the inflationary modes with that of the schrdinger picture .",
    "we first provide a brief account of the inflationary perturbations and the squeezing of the modes in the heisenberg picture , following @xcite .",

    "the basic physical idea behind dynamically induced wave - function collapse is that spontaneous and random wave function collapses occur all the time for all particles , whether isolated or interacting and whether they are forming a microscopic , mesoscopic or macroscopic system .    on a mathematical level , these ideas are implemented by modifying the schrdinger equation while introducing extra terms exhibiting the following properties : ( 1 ) non - linearity so as to yield the breakdown of superposition principle at a macroscopic level , ( 2 ) stochasticity so as to be able to explain the random outcomes of a measurement process and their distribution according to the born probability rule ( stochasticity is moreover needed to avoid superluminal communication ) , ( 3 ) allowance for an amplification mechanism according to which the new terms have negligible effects on microscopic system dynamics but strong effects for large many - particle macroscopic systems in order to recover their classical - like behavior .    to achieve this goal , a randomly fluctuating classical field , assumed to fill all of space , couples to the quantum system number density operator to make the system collapse into its spatially localized eigenstates . the collapse process being continuous in time",

    "[ wigner2 ] we can see that despite the presence of a csl correction with a constant @xmath0 the wigner function shows that the wavefunctional collapse has not taken place in the field eigenbasis and hence this scenario fails to explain the macro - objectification of the inflationary quantum fluctuations .",
    "now let us see the nature of power spectrum due to the effects of csl mechanism . from eqn .",
    "( [ power - r ] ) we see that the scale - dependence of the power arises from the factor @xmath257 . also from the above discussion",
    "we see that @xmath208 depends upon time @xmath7 for both long and short modes making the power spectrum time - dependent which is quite contrary to a generic inflationary scenario .",
    "this phenomenon has also been observed in @xcite where the authors have evaluated the power at the end of inflation .",
    "following the same method as in @xcite we rewrite @xmath251 as @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the comoving wave number of the mode which is at the horizon today @xmath260 and @xmath261 is the number of e - foldings the mode @xmath81 has spent outside the hubble radius during inflation and thus @xmath262 for observationally relevant modes .",
    "it must be noted that it is not obvious in such a scenario whether the power spectrum calculated at the end of inflation would be the same at recombination .",
    "but as these modes are superhorizon at the end of inflation , one can expect the causal physics after inflation to not affect these modes considerably .",
    "hence for shorter modes we have @xmath263 which yields the power spectrum using eqn .",
    "( [ power - r ] ) as @xmath264 which is a scale - invariant power spectrum . on the other hand for longer modes one",
    "gets @xmath265 which yields a power spectrum @xmath266 we see that for longer modes the power is scale - dependent @xmath267 which is not in accordance with the observations .",
    "hence it has been suggested in @xcite that these modes which are scale - dependent due to the effects of csl mechanism are still outside the horizon and thus observationally irrelevant .",
    "however in this way the observationally relevant modes will be the ones least affected by csl and hence it will not be appropriate to expect localization in field variables for these modes due to csl . thus if one calls for csl - like mechanism to explain the classicalization of modes which are observationally relevant then the scale - dependence of the power spectrum is inevitable .",
    "but , it is interesting to note that in the constant @xmath0 model one can consider @xmath268dependent @xmath0 ( in which case all the above derivations hold true ) which can cure such discrepancies in the power spectrum as we will see in the later section .",
    "in the previous sections we discussed the squeezing of modes in a generic inflationary scenario as well as in the scenario of martin _ et al . _ where ` csl - like ' modifications to inflationary dynamics have been considered with a constant ` csl - like ' parameter @xmath0 . in both these cases we observed that the squeezing of superhorizon modes happens in the direction of momentum which fails to explain the macro - objectification of the modes observed in the field - direction .",
    "also , the scenario of inflation with constant csl - like term lacks one essential feature of csl modifications to quantum mechanics - namely the ` amplification mechanism ' . as the csl - like parameter @xmath0 is introduced as a constant in the functional schrdinger equation of mode functions ( see eqn .",
    "( [ func - sch - eq ] ) ) the rate of localization is the same for all modes , larger or shorter . on the contrary , in csl - modified quantum mechanics larger objects ( with larger mass )",
    "becomes classical faster ( i.e. their wave - function collapses more rapidly ) than shorter objects which helps keep the microscopic objects in the quantum domain over astronomical time - scales . here",
    "mass of a system ( or a particle while dealing with single - particle system ) has been chosen consciously as the relevant parameter of efficient collapse .",
    "such a choice is very natural and driven by our prior knowledge of quantum and classical systems which can be distinctly discriminated by their mass . in the same spirit , while applying csl - like modification to inflationary dynamics to justify the macro - objectification of the superhorizon modes , one should expect the modes to behave more classically as they start crossing the horizon , which indicates that the csl - like term @xmath0 should discriminate between different modes according to their physical length scales and grow stronger as a mode starts crossing the horizon during inflation . hence @xmath0 should be a function of length scale ( or equivalently of conformal time @xmath7 ) . such a choice of scale dependence of @xmath0 is also a conscious selection which is based on our prior knowledge of quantum and classical fields which can be discriminated by their population density and we know that with increasing length scales modes become more and more populated .",
    "we will see further that similar to the case in standard inflation , the physical length scale @xmath269 of a mode @xmath81 is related to the squeezing parameter @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath58 itself is directly related to the expectation of occupancy in a particular mode @xcite in the standard inflationary scenario , it seems natural to expect amplification with respect to the physical size in the inflationary context as it will correspond to a large occupancy in that particular mode for which classical behavior is more natural both from standard qft and non - relativistic csl formalism viewpoint .",
    "we therefore propose a phenomenological ansatz for the form of @xmath0 as @xmath270 where @xmath271 so that the effects of csl - like terms dominate as the modes evolve to cross the horizon and become superhorizon .",
    "secondly , in the deep subhorizon regime we want the modes to evolve through standard unitary evolution .",
    "thus , any modification should be vanishingly small in the extreme subhorizon case in order to obtain the bunch - davies vacuum in that limit .",

    "this also happens in a generic inflationary scenario as well as in the case where csl - like correction is done with a constant @xmath0 and we see as before that such a case fails to explain the macro - objectification of the modes observed in various experiments .",

    "[ wigner3 ] we see that as long as we have @xmath310 , the squeezing remains in the direction of momentum whereas for the range @xmath312 the direction of squeezing changes in favor of the field variable .",
    "this scenario is thus in accordance with the macro - objectification of the modes as suggested by cosmological observations without invoking requirement of decoherence and hence avoiding many - worlds scenario for explaining the observations .",
    "we previously saw in the case of constant @xmath0 that introduction of csl - like terms in the inflationary dynamics yield a scale - dependent power spectrum for the comoving curvature perturbations for the largest modes which contradicts the precise measurement of cmbr power spectrum of high - precision observations made by experiments like wmap @xcite and planck @xcite .",
    "it is thus suggested in @xcite that these scale - dependent modes affected by constant csl - like terms are still superhorizon at present day and thus are not related to these observations .",
    "the shorter modes on the other hand are not affected much by the csl - like term @xmath0 and thus can produce a scale - invariant power spectrum which is in accordance with the observations .",
    "this suggests that the constant @xmath0 can spoil the observed scale invariance of the power spectrum and also suggests that csl - like modifications to quantum theory are contradicted by inflationary dynamics .",
    "however , since now in our case @xmath0 can depend upon @xmath7 as well as @xmath81 we can thus try to construct a scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "we see from eqn .",
    "( [ power - r ] ) that the scale - dependence of the power spectrum comes from the factor @xmath315 .",
    "it is also to be noted that this factor depends upon @xmath7 yielding a time - dependent power spectrum as we also got while considering constant @xmath0 . in order to remove this @xmath7 dependence in the case of constant @xmath0",
    "the power spectrum was calculated at the end of inflation using eqn .",
    "( [ end - inf ] ) .",
    "we follow the same path here and calculate the power at the end of inflation",
    ".    we will be interested in the parameter regime where @xmath312 as in this regime the macro - objectification of modes can be explained . in this regime @xmath208",
    "can be approximately written in the superhorizon limit as @xmath316 thus in a de sitter space the scale - dependence of the power spectrum would be @xmath317 where we have used eqn .",
    "( [ end - inf ] ) for the last equality . in its present form",
    "we can see that if @xmath318 has no dependence upon @xmath81 then the power would still be scale - dependent .",
    "but this can be fixed by fixing the scale dependence of @xmath319 . in doing",
    "so we consider the form of @xmath319 as @xmath320 where @xmath321 is a constant with no dependence upon @xmath81 or @xmath7 .",
    "with this we see that the scale - dependence of the power spectrum of the comoving curvature power spectrum would be @xmath322 and thus by setting @xmath323 one can get a scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "as we are interested in the range @xmath312 , this sets a range for @xmath324 too as @xmath325 .",
    "however , as correctly pointed out in @xcite the power spectrum remains time - dependent in such analysis , therefore , making any comparison of the power spectrum at the end of inflation with that at recombination non - trivial .",
    "so far , while making modification to inflationary dynamics by adding csl - like terms with either constant @xmath0 or @xmath0 which has @xmath81 and @xmath7 dependence , we were concerned about one observational consequence of inflationary dynamics : scale - invariance of the anisotropy spectrum of the precisely measured cmbr temperature fluctuations . on the other hand , it is also very important to note here that a generic inflationary scenario not only predicts a scale - invariant power spectrum , but also explains the existence of sharp peaks and troughs of the cmbr power spectrum which is caused by the coherent initial phases of all the fourier modes of curvature perturbations at horizon re - entry corresponding to a given wave number .",
    "we previously showed ( eqn .",
    "( [ phase - coherence ] ) and discussion thereafter ) how in a generic inflationary scenario the phase @xmath66 of the mode function @xmath55 freezes on super - horizon scales . in standard inflationary scenario",
    "we will see that it leads to freezing of the amplitude of the curvature perturbation on super - horizon scales . upon re - entry",
    "the curvature perturbation begins to oscillate and it can be shown that all modes corresponding to a given wave number begin their oscillations with same initial phase ( not to be confused with @xmath66 ) in that case , leading to a coherent interference to produce peaks and troughs in the cmbr power spectrum and a snapshot of it at the last scattering surface is what we observe today in different experiments such as wmap @xcite and planck @xcite .",
    "but if all the fourier modes of a given length scale had random phases , they would have interfered destructively to wash out all those sharp peaks and troughs of the cmbr spectrum to leave us simply with a flat spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have seen before that modifying inflationary dynamics by csl - like terms with constant @xmath0 can yield a scale - dependent power spectrum for large scales which then contradicts with the observations .",
    "one can preferably keep these modes outside the horizon ; thus making them observationally less important , but the smaller modes which explain a scale - invariant power spectrum are not much affected by csl - like terms and thus their classicality can not be explained by modification of inflationary dynamics with csl mechanism . on the other hand we have seen that by making the csl - like parameter @xmath0 dependent upon @xmath81 and @xmath7 there exists a parameter range ( @xmath312 and @xmath325 ) where the macro - objectification of modes as well as a scale - invariant power spectrum can both be explained simultaneously . in this section",
    "we consider the phase coherence of the superhorizon modes and investigate whether inflationary dynamics modified by csl - like mechanism is also in accordance with phase coherence or whether such csl - like modifications of inflationary dynamics can spoil these patterns we observe in the cmbr spectrum and thus contradict the observations .",
    "as argued above , phase coherence is related to the freezing of the amplitude of the curvature perturbation ( @xmath326 ) with respect to @xmath7 . in standard inflation",
    "this is a trivial exercise to check by the means of the equation of motion for the variable @xmath55 by substituting @xmath55 as @xmath327 , where @xmath66 carries the overall phase dependence , since @xmath326 is given by the quantity @xmath328 .",
    "the equations for its real and imaginary parts can be separated as @xcite @xmath329&=&0 , \\label{real}\\\\   \\delta_k^{''}+2\\left(\\frac{r_k'}{r_k}\\right)\\delta_k'&=&0,\\label{imaginary}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . from eqn .",
    "( [ imaginary ] ) we can see that @xmath71 is a fixed point of the equation and @xmath330 approaches this value asymptotically , i.e. for @xmath331 .",
    "therefore , @xmath332 and hence @xmath333 is constant resulting in the phenomenon of phase coherence .",
    "but we note here that similar analysis of phase coherence in the case of csl - modified inflationary dynamics would not hold as in such a case it is difficult to identify the parameter @xmath55 as the mode function as has been discussed before .",
    "but the requirement of phase coherence is related to freezing of amplitude of @xmath334 on super horizon scales .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ power - r ] ) that in schrdinger picture analysis the amplitude of curvature perturbations varies as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    as the behavior of @xmath257 is known for superhorizon modes for all the cases we discussed above , one can determine whether the amplitude of comoving curvature perturbation freezes on superhorizon scales in each such case or not .",
    "let us analyze the phenomena of phase coherence case by case :    \\1 . :",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ large ] ) that in such a case @xmath336 which shows that @xmath337 indicating that on superhorizon scales ( @xmath74 ) the amplitude grows and would not freeze .",
    "thus such modes can not lead to phase coherence of the cmbr spectrum .",
    "we recall that these modes also violate the scale invariance of the power spectrum and thus are inconsistent with observation .",
    ":    in this case we see from eq .",
    "( [ small ] ) that @xmath257 is a constant in @xmath7 which indicates that @xmath326 does freeze on superhorizon scales and thus can give rise to the observed phase coherence of the cmbr spectrum .",
    "we also recall that such modes can yield a scale invariant spectrum and thus are observationally consistent . but as these modes are the ones least affected by the collapse operator and lead to a wigner function squeezed in the momentum direction , rather than field direction , they do not satisfy the macro - objectivity criterion .    \\3 . :",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ scale - dep ] ) that @xmath338 which yields the evolution of amplitude of curvature perturbations on superhorizon scales as @xmath339 this indicates that for @xmath340 the amplitude freezes on superhorizon scales and thus such modes can give rise to the observed phenomena of phase coherence in the cmbr spectrum .",
    "we also recall that this bound on @xmath311 is also in accordance with macro - objectification of modes .",
    "thus once @xmath312 one can obtain macro - objectification of the modes and can also remain consistent with observations .",
    "in this work we have analyzed an alternative scheme of dealing with the issue of classicalization of inflationary perturbations .",
    "this mechanism , although phenomenological at best , derives its motivation from a similar proposed modification to quantum theory , known as continuous spontaneous localization , which addresses the issue of classicalization of macroscopic systems in non - relativistic physics .",
    "although this scheme is not fully developed and still lacks a relativistic generalization , one can make an attempt to implement a similar stochastic correction in the schrdinger representation of the field theoretic description .",
    "_ @xcite recently took a step in this direction by considering a csl analog with constant @xmath0 parameter .",
    "but it fails to capture the essential feature of such schemes , namely the amplification mechanism .",
    "moreover , such a constant @xmath0 model also leads to a distortion of the scale - invariance of power spectrum and so is in conflict with cosmological observations .",
    "we take this approach further and consider a variable @xmath0 model .",
    "we expect such a generalization to make the wavefunction evolve into one of the eigenfunctions of field variable .",
    "this should reflect itself in the squeezing of wigner function along the field direction .",
    "the standard inflationary scenario squeezes the wigner function along the momentum direction .",
    "also , neither a small constant @xmath0 nor any modification of the form of @xmath6 can yield squeezing in the field direction and hence fail to explain ` single - outcome ' of the measured modes . although one can take arbitrarily large @xmath0 to cure for the squeezing direction , but our result shows that such models will still be at variance with phase coherence observed in the cmbr profile .",
    "however one can attempt a generalization where the csl strength parameter is made time dependent so that the strength of correction will depend on the physical length scales of concerned modes .",
    "we see that although the most general class of ` collapsing models ' will distort the power spectrum , there does exist a subfamily of these models which can generate scale invariance in accordance with the data without constraining the model further .",
    "it is to be noted here that in order to achieve scale - invariance of the spectrum we have exploited the arbitrariness of @xmath81 dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "it has so far no justification from the point of view of field theory and rather it is purely phenomenological .",
    "but until a relativistic generalization of csl is achieved , this arbitrariness , we believe , is difficult to avoid .",
    "in addition to scale - invariance of the power spectrum , the cmbr data also suggests the phase coherence of initial density perturbations which manifests itself in the acoustic peaks of the cmbr map .",
    "this observation also constrains one of the parameters , namely @xmath311 to be greater than 1 , which tallies with the requirement of macro - objectification .",
    "thus such a model can account for cosmological observations such as scale - invariance of the primordial spectrum and the existence of acoustic peaks in the cmbr while providing a mechanism for macro - objectification .",
    "this also means that such bounds on the model parameter @xmath311 should be respected by any suitable relativistic modification of csl to be compatible with cosmology .",
    "one important aspect of such csl - like analysis in the fourier basis is the non - conservation of energy .",
    "csl formalism generically suffers with an ever - present non - conservation of energy @xcite in the infinite temperature thermal bath model .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , a mode - by - mode analysis of inflationary fluctuations will make the expectation of the hamiltonian diverge . for constant @xmath0 model",
    "the divergence is @xmath341 while for our model the divergence is quite severe with a @xmath342 dependence where @xmath343 .",
    "such a strong increase in the energy density , even after regularization , can possibly lead to back - reaction and will be worth studying in future .",
