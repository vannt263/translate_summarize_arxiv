    "<S> it is worth noting that , in all architectures [ enum : arc1]-[enum : arc3 ] the state prepared after [ exp : evolution ] is a resource for postselected measurement - based quantum computation postselecting w.r.t .  the measurements in [ exp : measurement ] ( appendix d ) , but as such does not amount to universal quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , architectures [ enum : arc1]-[enum : arc3 ] require _ neither _ adaptive measurements ( which are key in mbqc  @xcite ) _ nor _ physical postselection : our result states that if three plausible complexity - theoretic conjectures hold a single - shot readout can not be classically simulated . </S>",
    "<S> +      we now turn to stating that while the above three architectures i - iii are physically feasible , the output distributions of measurements can not be efficiently classically simulated on classical computers , based on plausible assumptions and standard complexity - theoretic arguments .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : main ] if conjectures [ conj : conjecturepolyhiear]-[conj : anticoncentration ] below are true then a classical computer can not sample from the outcome distribution of any architecture i - iii up to error 1/22 in @xmath0 norm in time @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> as in previous works @xcite , theorem  [ thm : main ] relies on plausible complexity - theoretic conjectures . </S>",
    "<S> the first , originally adopted in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is a widely believed statement about the structure of an infinite tower of complexity classes known as `` the polynomial hierarchy '' ( @xmath47 ) , the levels of which recursively endow the classes , , and with oracles to previous levels .    </S>",
    "<S> [ conj : conjecturepolyhiear ] the polynomial hierarchy is infinite .    the claim generalizes the familiar @xmath48 conjecture in that @xmath49 would imply a complete collapse of @xmath47 to its @xmath50-th level . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if two levels @xmath51 , @xmath52 coincide , then all classes above level @xmath51 collapse to it . </S>",
    "<S> the available evidence for @xmath48 makes conjecture  [ conj : conjecturepolyhiear ] plausible , for it would be surprising to find a collapse of @xmath47 to some level @xmath51 but not a full one @xcite ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for further discussion ) . similarly to the riemann hypothesis in number theory , many theorems in complexity theory have been proven relative to conjecture [ conj : conjecturepolyhiear ] , probably most notably the karp - lipton theorem @xmath53 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we highlight that , assuming conjecture  [ conj : conjecturepolyhiear ] only , a classical computer would still not be able to sample from our experiments either exactly or within any constant relative error ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> appendix f ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , such level of accuracy is physically unrealistic for it can not be achieved by a quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> a goal of this work is to understand how unlikely is for architectures [ enum : arc1]-[enum : arc3 ] to be classically intractable under realistic errors .    our second conjecture , adopted from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is a qubit analog of the `` permanent - of - gaussians '' conjecture   @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it states that partition functions of ( unstructured ) random ising models should be equally hard to approximate in average- and worst - case . </S>",
    "<S> now , let @xmath54 be the outcomes of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 measurements in our architectures , with @xmath55 for [ enum : arc1]-[enum : arc2 ] . in appendix b we show that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the partition function of a random ising model on an @xmath58 square lattice @xmath59 : @xmath60where @xmath61 ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath62 ) is random and do- ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> either do- or ti@xmath31- ) distributed .    </S>",
    "<S> [ conj : isingaveragecomplexity ] for random ising models as in  ( [ eq : randomisingmodel ] ) , approximating @xmath63 up to relative error  @xmath64 for any 0.3 fraction of the field configurations is as hard as in worst - case .    </S>",
    "<S> we complement conjecture  [ conj : isingaveragecomplexity ] with the following lemma .    </S>",
    "<S> [ lemma : sharpphardness ] let @xmath65 be the ising model  ( [ eq : randomisingmodel ] ) on the @xmath58 square lattice with either ( i ) do - distributed @xmath62 and @xmath66 ; or ( ii ) ti@xmath31-distributed @xmath62 and @xmath67 . then , for @xmath68 , approximating @xmath63 with relative error  @xmath64 is -hard .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , accepting conjecture  [ conj : isingaveragecomplexity ] implies that approximating @xmath63 for these models is as hard in average as any problem in @xcite . the proof ( appendix e ) applies mbqc methods @xcite to show that [ enum : arc1]-[enum : arc3 ] are computationally equivalent to an encoded @xmath3-qubit 1d nearest - neighbor circuit comprising random gates of the form @xmath69\\left[\\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n}z_i^{c_i}{\\textnormal{{e}}}^{-{\\textnormal{{i}}}\\theta d_iz_i}h_i\\right],c_i , d_i\\in\\{0,1\\}\\label{eq : translationinvariantgateset},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 ) is do ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> do - or - ti@xmath31- ) distributed and @xmath72 is the hadamard gate . </S>",
    "<S> post - selecting such circuits , we can implement two known universal schemes of quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then exploit that universal quantum - circuit amplitudes are -hard to approximate . as a last remark </S>",
    "<S> , we mention that our bound @xmath68 in lemma  [ lemma : sharpphardness ] can be improved to @xmath73 in architectures  [ enum : arc1]-[enum : arc2 ] by introducing new types of input states ( appendix h ) ; based on this fact and haar - random properties of these circuits ( cf .  below ) , we believe lemma  [ lemma : sharpphardness ] should extend to the @xmath73 regime .    </S>",
    "<S> last , we claim that random circuits of gates of form ( [ eq : translationinvariantgateset ] ) anti - concentrate .    [ conj : anticoncentration ] let @xmath74 be an @xmath3-qubit @xmath75-depth random circuit of gates of form ( [ eq : translationinvariantgateset ] ) , then @xmath76 for a uniformly random choice of @xmath77 .    in appendix h , we show that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : anticoncentrationprob ] ) is a sufficient condition for the output distribution of architectures [ enum : arc1]-[enum : arc3 ] to display anti - concentration . </S>",
    "<S> analog numerically - supported conjectures have been made in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> . analytic proofs of anti - concentration are currently only known for some iqp - circuit families @xcite . here , we ran exact simulations of random circuits with up to 20 logical qubits to test conjecture [ conj : anticoncentration ] ( appendix g ) , and observed , first , that the anti - concentration ratio of eq.([eq : anticoncentrationprob ] ) quickly converges to @xmath78 with the system - size ; and , second , that measurement outcomes are porter - thomas @xcite ( i.e. , exponentially ) distributed , which is a signature of chaotic haar - random unitary processes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> previously , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite argued that anti - concentration of measurement outcomes on an @xmath79 lattice should require @xmath80 physical depth on 2d nn layouts in order not to induce a violation of the counting exponential time hypothesis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the constant - depth nature of our proposal . to clarify this discrepancy </S>",
    "<S> , we note that our numerical evidence for anti - concentration is for logical @xmath3-qubit 1d circuits  ( [ eq : translationinvariantgateset ] ) of depth @xmath75 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : circuits ] ) , which implies anti - concentration of the corresponding constant - depth evolution on a lattice of size @xmath81 . because this encoding introduces a linear overhead factor @xmath75 there is no contradiction with refs </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more critically , the observed signatures of anti - concentration rule out a potential efficient classical simulation of our schemes via sparse - sampling methods @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we end this section with a remark : closest to our work is the approach of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is an also an nnti non - adaptive mbqc proposal with larger resource requirements ( see table [ tab : resources ] for a comparison ) and stronger hardness assumptions with regards to the required level of approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it introduces a variation of conjecture [ conj : isingaveragecomplexity ] with an unconventional type of error that is larger than any additive or relative approximation ; the latter encapsulates conjectures [ conj : isingaveragecomplexity]-[conj : anticoncentration ] as presented here . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite gave non - ti schemes based on time - dependent nn random circuits acting on square lattices : the latter approaches require less qubits , but also circuits of polynomial depth . in ours and in that of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , circuit depth is traded with ancillas and kept constant . for ours and that of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , efficient certification protocols also exist and can be used to determine if the experiment has actually worked , as discussed below .      </S>",
    "<S> besides lemma  [ lemma : sharpphardness ] , a technical ingredient in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] ( appendix f ) is stockmeyer s theorem  @xcite . by similar arguments as in the boson - sampling and iqp - circuit settings  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , if an efficient classical algorithm can approximately sample from the output distribution of architectures [ enum : arc1]-[enum : arc3 ] , then an @xmath82 algorithm can approximate a large fraction of the amplitudes in ( [ eq : probabilities = partfunct ] ) if they are sufficiently anti - concentrated . by conjectures [ conj : isingaveragecomplexity]-[conj : anticoncentration ] , the latter algorithm can solve any problem in @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy to its 3rd level .      </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to discussing that the above assumptions are plausible in several physical architectures close to what is available with present technology . </S>",
    "<S> what we are considering are large - scale quantum lattice architectures on square lattices @xmath84 with a quantum degree of freedom per lattice site . on the level of physical implementation , </S>",
    "<S> the most advanced family of such architectures is that provided by _ </S>",
    "<S> cold atoms in optical lattices _ @xcite . in an optical lattice architecture , </S>",
    "<S> internal degrees of freedom are available with hyperfine levels . also , the encoding in spatial degrees of freedom within double wells is in principle conceivable . </S>",
    "<S> large - scale translationally invariant controlled - z interactions  precisely of the type as they are required for the preparation of cluster and graph states @xcite  are feasible via controlled collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other interactions to nearest neighbors are also conceivable . </S>",
    "<S> interactions such as spin - changing collisions for @xmath85rb atoms have been experimentally observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> controlled-@xmath86 gates require a more sophisticated interaction hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the dangling bonds seem realizable making use of optical superlattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> single sites  specifically of the sampling type considered here  can be addressed in optical lattice architectures via several methods . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , quantum - gas microscopes allow for single - site resolved imaging @xcite , even though the type of single - site addressing required here remains a significant challenge . </S>",
    "<S> optical superlattices @xcite allow for the addressing of entire rows of sites in the same fashion . </S>",
    "<S> entire rows that contain a fixed particle number neighboring ones left empty can already be routinely prepared @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , disordered initial states can be prepared @xcite .    but </S>",
    "<S> also other architectures are well conceivable . </S>",
    "<S> this includes in particular large arrays of _ semiconductor quantum dots _ allowing for single - site addressing  a setting that has already been employed to simulate the mott - hubbard model in the atomic limit @xcite  or polaritons or exciton - polariton systems in _ arrays of micro - cavities _ @xcite . in this type of architecture , </S>",
    "<S> the addressing of entire rows is also particularly feasible . _ </S>",
    "<S> superconducting architectures _ also promise to allow for large - scale array structures of the type anticipated here @xcite . _ </S>",
    "<S> trapped ions _ can also serve as feasible architectures @xcite . none of the physical architectures realize all elements required to the necessary precision , but at the same time , the prescriptions presented here are comparably close to what can be done .      </S>",
    "<S> it is key to all schemes proposed that the correctness of the final resource - state preparation in the quantum simulation can be efficiently and rigorously certified . </S>",
    "<S> since the prepared state is the ground state of a gapped and frustration - free parent hamiltonian , there exists a scheme involving local measurements only that certifies the closeness of the prepared state @xmath87 to anticipated state @xmath88 immediately before measurement in terms of an upper bound on the trace - distance @xmath89 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this directly yields an upper bound on the @xmath0-norm distance between the respective measurement outcome distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the certification scheme is a more difficult prescription that the experiment as such , and assumes the ability to perform noise - free measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is key to see that the correctness of the final - state preparation can be certified even the absence of a possibility of efficiently classically sampling the output distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is also in contrast to other similar schemes , where no efficient rigorous scheme for certification of the final state before measurement is known @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the property of the final - state preparation being certifiable is rooted in the fact that the states prepared are ground states of gapped frustration - free local hamiltonian models . at the same time they are injective _ projected entangled pair states ( peps ) _ of constant bond dimension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the protocols discussed here can hence be seen as peps sampling protocols that generate samples from local measurement on peps .      in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have established feasible schemes for quantum simulation that exhibit quantum supremacy in a complexity - theoretic sense . </S>",
    "<S> this work can be seen as an invitation towards a number of further exciting research directions : while the schemes presented do not quite yet constitute experimentally realizable blue - prints , it should be clear that steps already experimentally taken are very similar to those discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it seems hence interesting to explore detailed settings for cold atoms or trapped ions in detail , requiring little local control and allowing for comparably short coherence times . </S>",
    "<S> what is more , it appears obvious that further complexity - theoretic results on intermediate problems seem needed to fully capture the potential of quantum devices outperforming classical computers without being universal quantum computers . </S>",
