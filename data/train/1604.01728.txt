    "current and future accelerator - based neutrino - oscillation experiments aim to make high precision measurements of oscillation parameters by examining the @xmath4 and @xmath5 content of their beams as a function of neutrino energy in the sub - gev to few - gev range@xcite .",
    "the signature of a @xmath4(@xmath5 ) charged - current ( cc ) interaction , the signal in such experiments , is the presence of an e@xmath6(e@xmath7 ) in the final state that originates from the neutrino interaction vertex . in order to extract the desired parameters , it is necessary to compare the observed signal to a simulation containing all processes that can produce a real single e@xmath6(e@xmath7 ) in the final state as well as processes that can mimic this signature .",
    "precise estimates of the parameters therefore require accurate and complete models of all potential background processes .",
    "consequently , it is important to characterize and understand any observations of neutrino - induced events in the sub - gev to many - gev range that contain electromagnetic showers .    in a separate paper ,",
    "the  collaboration reported a measurement of @xmath4 cc quasielastic and quasielastic - like scattering in the numi beam at an average neutrino energy of 3.6  gev @xcite . during the data analysis leading to those results , an unexpectedly large number of events was observed containing electromagnetic showers likely caused by photon conversions . in this letter , this excess of events is measured relative to the expectation based on a sample of simulated data produced using current state - of - the - art models of neutrino production and interactions .",
    "these events are seen to exhibit features expected of neutral current ( nc ) diffractive @xmath0 production from hydrogen in the hydrocarbon target .",
    "these results constitute the first direct experimental observation and characterization of this process .",
    "an analogous process that happens exclusively on nuclei heavier than hydrogen , nc coherent @xmath0 production , has been observed previously@xcite ; however , the contribution from nc diffractive scattering from hydrogen , when present in the target , has been considered only inclusively with the scattering from the heavier nuclei and not examined separately as is done here .",
    "this measurement offers an experimental constraint on models of nc diffractive @xmath0 production and the a - dependence of coherent scattering .",
    "it is of general interest in neutrino physics and of particular importance for oscillation experiments using detectors containing water or hydrocarbons or any other material containing hydrogen .",
    "the  experiment studies neutrinos produced in the numi beamline at fermi national accelerator laboratory .",
    "this analysis uses data taken between march 2010 and april 2012 with @xmath8 protons on target ( pot).@xcite during this period , the beam consisted predominantly of @xmath3 with a peak energy of and a high - energy tail extending up to tens of gev such that the mean neutrino energy was .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 made up approximately 1.6% of the total neutrino flux .",
    "the neutrino beam simulation used by  is described in ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the  detector @xcite consists of a core of scintillator strips arranged in planes and oriented in three views for three - dimensional tracking .",
    "the triangular strips ( @xmath9 ) making up the sensitive portion of the detectors are sufficiently fine - grained to ensure reliable detection and characterization of electromagnetic showers at energies of above roughly .",
    "the scintillator core is augmented by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry on both the sides and the downstream end of the detector .",
    "the  detector s response is simulated by tuned geant4-based@xcite software .",
    "the energy scale is set by requiring that the photostatistics and reconstructed energy for energy deposited by momentum - analyzed muons traversing the detector agree in data and simulation .",
    "additional algorithm - specific tuning , including corrections for passive material , is done using the simulation @xcite .",
    "simulated neutrino interactions , generated with the genie 2.6.2 neutrino event generator @xcite , are used for comparison to the data and efficiency corrections .",
    "of particular interest in this letter are processes that contain electromagnetic showers .",
    "the dominant source of electromagnetic showers in these neutrino interactions is neutral pion production , which is modeled in the generator via resonant production from nucleons according to the rein - sehgal model ; via coherent interactions with nuclei according to the pcac formalism of rein and sehgal @xcite ; and via the hadronization model in non - resonant inelastic production .",
    "further details on other processes simulated by the generator , as well as the external data sets used for tuning the generator , are described briefly in ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "events of interest were selected as part of the @xmath4 cc quasielastic scattering analysis@xcite@xcite .",
    "candidate events are created from reconstructed tracks originating in the central scintillator region of the  detector@xcite . to remove the overwhelming background from @xmath10 cc events , tracks are not considered if they exit the back of the detector as muons are expected to do .",
    "candidate electromagnetic showers are identified by examining energy depositions within a region that consists of the union of two volumes : a cylinder of radius extending from the event vertex along the track direction and a @xmath11 cone with an apex at the event vertex ( origin of track ) and a symmetry axis along the track direction .",
    "the full region ( referred to below as the ` shower cone ' ) extends in length through the scintillator and electromagnetic calorimeter portions of  until it reaches a gap of approximately three radiation lengths along the cone where no significant energy is deposited .",
    "this shower cone object is evaluated using a multivariate particle identification ( pid ) algorithm which combines details of the energy deposition pattern both longitudinally ( mean @xmath12 and the fraction of energy at the downstream end of cone ) and transverse to the axis of the cone ( mean shower width ) using a @xmath13-nearest - neighbors ( knn ) algorithm@xcite .    for events deemed by the pid algorithm to be electromagnetic - like",
    ", the @xmath12 at the front of the shower cone is examined to see if it is more consistent with a single particle , such as that expected from an electron ( or positron ) , or two particles , as would be seen in a photon pair conversion into @xmath14 . here",
    ", the energy in the @xmath12 measure is taken to be the minimum energy contained in a window along the shower , where the downstream end of the window is allowed to slide up to from the vertex .",
    "this sliding window technique reduces any potential bias induced by nuclear activity near the interaction point@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_dedx ] shows the minimum @xmath12 during this process for both the data and simulation . for comparison , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_dedx ] shows the same variable for simulated samples of single photons or electrons , chosen with a flat energy distribution in the range from 0.5 to 5.0 gev .",
    "electron showers tend to lie in an interval between 1 and , while the photons populate a somewhat wider range peaking at .",
    "the  modeling of photons and electrons was validated against the data successfully with samples of separated @xmath0 conversion photons and michel electrons@xcite .",
    "the electron region of fig .",
    "[ fig_dedx ] , peaking at approximately in both the data and the simulation , is well - modeled ; in both shape and magnitude , the data and simulation differ by less than 10% .",
    "however , the photon peak in the data contains an excess relative to the prediction with @xmath15 statistical - only significance .",
    "systematic uncertainties , particularly those associated with the flux model and the estimate of the other processes predicted in that region , reduce the significance to @xmath16 .",

    "other systematic errors are described in detail in reference @xcite . )    since distributions made using a sideband sample of @xmath4 events containing michel electrons agree very well with the simulation , the excess of data events is unlikely to have arisen from the misreconstruction of electrons or errors in the modeling of electromagnetic showers in the simulation . in addition ,",
    "[ fig_dedx ] shows that the excess is not compatible with an overall normalization offset of the sample .",
    "the possibility of the excess arising from mismodeled non - shower activity near the event vertex ( i.e. , nucleons ) was examined by injecting extra protons into simulated electron showers in a fashion consistent with the findings in recent  muon neutrino scattering results @xcite ( uniformly from 0 - 225 mev in 25% of the simulated showers ) .",
    "these samples did not exhibit an excess in the photon region of the reconstructed @xmath12 distribution .",
    "moreover , as will be shown in the following sections , the excess events in the photon region are qualitatively different than any of the event types predicted by the simulation under the photon peak .     near the front of candidate electromagnetic showers for data ( crosses ) and the simulated neutrino event sample ( solid ) .",

    "in order to characterize the excess in fig .  [ fig_dedx ] , events exhibiting minimum @xmath12 between 2.2 and @xmath17{mev / cm}$ ] were selected in both the data and the simulation .",
    "kinematic distributions of the candidate em shower in these events were examined after subtracting the simulation from the data bin - by - bin .",
    "distributions made in this fashion provide a picture of what is missing in the simulation and thereby characterize the excess .",
    "the excess was compared to single - particle samples of photons and @xmath0 s which were simulated with broad distributions in energy ( 0 - 20 gev ) and angle with respect to the longitudinal detector axis ( 0-@xmath18/2 ) and processed using the  reconstruction .",
    "a similar sample of @xmath19 s was also constructed to investigate the possibility of a heavier state decaying into showering particles . in each of these samples , the events falling into the region of the photon - like excess in @xmath12 were generated to have the same two dimensional distribution of energy and angle as in the data excess .",
    "figure  [ fig : psi_pc ] shows a shape comparison for the  extra energy ratio \" variable @xmath20 , which represents the relative amount of energy outside the cone to that inside the cone , for these single - particle samples compared to the distribution of the excess in the data .",
    "energy depositions within of the interaction vertex were ignored when calculating @xmath20 to reduce the contribution from low - energy nucleons , which may not be simulated correctly @xcite . here ,",
    "the data are more consistent with photon or @xmath0 production than @xmath19 production . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : mspw_pc ] shows the median transverse width of the energy depositions in the cone object ( `` median shower width '' ) for the single - particle samples and the excess in the data . in this case",
    ", the data are less consistent with the behavior expected from a single particle than with that from a particle decaying into multiple photons .",
    "these single - particle studies along with the michel and injected proton studies mentioned above , suggest that the showers in the excess are most likely caused by photons from @xmath0 production and subsequent decay .",
    "the lack of a muon and the fact that the shower exhibits photon - like , rather than electron - like , energy deposition behavior together imply that the process contributing to the excess is a neutral - current ( nc ) interaction .",
    "other features of the sample can be examined to provide further insight into the nature of the interaction .",
    "figure  [ char ] shows shape comparisons of genie nc coherent and incoherent @xmath0 production with data distributions from the excess in several variables , where the content of each curve is normalized to unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : eshower_nc ] gives the reconstructed energy the electromagnetic shower , @xmath21 , where it can be seen that the data excess has a harder energy spectrum than the nc processes predicted by the model .",
    "however , the angular distribution of the shower in the data agrees very well in shape with the expectation from genie for nc coherent @xmath0 production , as demonstrated in the @xmath22 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etheta2_nc ] ) .",
    "the same is true in @xmath20 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_nc ] , as most of the events have relatively little energy outside the cone . however , the distribution of energy within a cone identical to the one described in sec .",
    "[ reconanal ] , except oriented backward along the original cone axis , is different . in this case ,",
    "illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : uie_nc ] , the data appear to have more in - line upstream energy than the nc coherent process and are more consistent with the nc incoherent process , suggesting a small nuclear recoil from the neutrino interaction . corroborating this hypothesis , the charge - weighted distance from that energy to the shower vertex",
    "was examined in the data sample and seen to fit the exponential decay distance expected for a photon conversion after propagating through the detector from the interaction point defined by the upstream activity .",
    "the results described above were supplemented by a visual scan of event displays for data in the excess region and a simulated neutrino event sample , as well as simulated single - particle samples .",
    "the conclusions from the scan were that the data in this region , relative to the simulated sample , contains a higher fraction of events with a @xmath0 and more events with in - line upstream energy .    finally , the difference between the data and the expectation from genie between 2.2 and 3.4 mev / cm in fig .",
    "[ fig_dedx ] was used to extract a total cross section for @xmath23 integrated over the  flux of @xmath24 . the phase space for this measurement",
    "was limited in @xmath21 to avoid model dependence by ensuring the value reported is in a region where  has good sensitivity .",
    "the most plausible source of the excess seen in the data is diffractive nc @xmath0 production from hydrogen in the scintillator target of .",
    "because little momentum is tranferred to the nucleus , this process is expected to be characterized by coherent - like kinematics ; but the comparatively small mass of the hydrogen nucleus would result in the proton sometimes being endowed with sufficient kinetic energy to manifest as in - line upstream energy in this analysis .",
    "in addition , nc diffractive scattering from hydrogen is not included in the genie simulation used by .",
    "though neutral - current excitation of a @xmath25 from a proton within a nucleus produces the same final state after the decay @xmath26 , the latter process is characterized by a strong peak around in the invariant mass spectrum of the events .",
    "the invariant mass distribution for the excess was computed , using the upstream inline energy distribution to form a rough estimate for the proton kinetic energy , and was found to occupy a broad @xmath27 spectrum peaking at about with fwhm of about .",
    "thus a deficiency in the resonant production model in genie , which simulates this process , is unlikely to be responsible for the excess , and leaves diffractive scattering as the best hypothesis .    to further test the hypothesis that the observed signal arises from diffractive nc @xmath0 production , comparisons were made to an early implementation in genie of a calculation of the diffractive process based on the work of rein @xcite that is valid for w@xmath282.0  gev .",
    "this model produces events with a similar cross section to the value observed by  for the excess and it contributes events in the region of the excess and very little outside that region .",
    "the model qualitatively agrees with the characteristics of the excess in terms of the shower angle , extra energy ratio and in - line upstream energy ( figs .",
    "3(b ) , 3(c ) , and 3(d ) , respectively ) , but exhibits a somewhat different shape in terms of the energy spectrum of the produced shower .",
    "further details of the comparison of the observed excess and the rein model can be found in ref .",
    "an excess of events containing electromagnetic showers observed by the  experiment appears to originate from the neutral - current production of neutral pions in a process not predicted by the genie neutrino interaction simulation program .",
    "interpretations of the excess as arising from errors in the flux or background predictions , or mismodeling of the electromagnetic shower process , are disfavored based on _ in situ _ sideband constraints .",
    "the observed process resembles coherent production apart from the existence of a small amount of upstream energy , implying that the events likely arise from diffractive pion production from hydrogen . the measured cross section for this process for @xmath29 , assuming the observed shower to come from photon conversions from the @xmath0 , is comparable to that for nc coherent @xmath0 production from carbon .",
    "these measurements , interpreted as nc diffractive scattering , constitute the first direct experimental observation and characterization of this process .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments with hydrogen in their targets must account for nc diffractive scattering in order to correctly model backgrounds to @xmath4 appearance .",
    "the data presented above will play an essential role in constraining models for diffractive production , such as the model in ref .",
    "but because the latter applies only at larger w , this work also highlights the need for models of diffractive scattering which extend to low w and e@xmath30 to be developed and incorporated in simulations .",
    "furthermore , these results are useful for understanding the a - dependence of coherent scattering which is important to all oscillation experiments .",
