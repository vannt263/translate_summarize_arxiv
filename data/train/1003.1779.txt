    "if scalar fields are ubiquitous in nature , some of them may remain light in the early universe .",
    "such scalar fields could be deviated from the low - energy minimum due to quantum fluctuations during inflation and/or modification of the scalar potential through gravitationally suppressed interactions with the inflaton . at a later time",
    "when the expansion rate becomes smaller than the mass , the scalar will start to roll down and oscillate about the potential minimum .",
    "the dynamics of such a scalar can exhibit rich phenomena in cosmology .",
    "we focus on a complex scalar field with a global u(1 ) symmetry at the potential minimum .",
    "the u(1 ) symmetry is not necessarily exact , and could be violated at high energy scales ; our arguments apply if it is a good symmetry at low energy .",
    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) is realized in nature , there may be many such scalar fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite coleman found that , if the scalar potential is shallower than a quadratic potential , there is a non - trivial field configuration that minimizes the energy for a fixed u(1 ) charge @xmath2 .",
    "since the solution has a spherical symmetry , the solution is named q - ball .",
    "a q - ball is a non - topological soliton whose stability is supported by the u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "it was noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite that q - balls play an important role in a context of the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism utilizes a flat direction of the supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) , which possesses a non - zero baryon ( or lepton ) number . a flat direction responsible for the ad mechanism",
    "is referred to as the ad field ( denoted by @xmath3 in the following ) .",
    "the ad field @xmath3 develops a large expectation value during inflation , and it starts to oscillate after inflation when the cosmic expansion rate becomes comparable to its mass . the baryon number is effectively created at the onset of the oscillations .",
    "finally , @xmath3 decays into the ordinary quarks , leaving the universe with a right amount of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "it was realized however that , soon after the onset of oscillations , the ad field experiences spatial instabilities and deforms into clumpy q - balls  @xcite .",
    "later it was shown in @xcite that most of the baryon asymmetry is absorbed into q - balls .",
    "its non - linear property necessitates numerical approach to the formation and the subsequent evolution .",
    "the properties of q - balls crucially depend on the size of the u(1 ) charge @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the mass per unit charge is a decreasing function of @xmath2 in case of gauge - mediation type q - balls ; for a large enough @xmath2 , the q - ball can be absolutely stable against the decay into nucleons and therefore contribute to dark matter  @xcite . in the case of unstable q - balls ,",
    "the decay rate depends on the charge , and q - balls can be very long - lived in a cosmological time scale for a sufficiently large @xmath2  @xcite , since the q - ball decay process takes place only in the vicinity of the surface  @xcite .",
    "thus it is of utmost importance to determine the charge distribution of the q - balls at the formation .",
    "there is a number of numerical studies on the q - balls .",
    "the q - ball formation has been first examined by kasuya and one of the authors ( mk ) on 3d lattice simulations in a context of gauge mediation  @xcite and gravity mediation  @xcite , taking account of the cosmic expansion .",
    "they found that most of the baryon number is absorbed into the largest q - balls in the lattices and estimated the typical q - ball charge .",
    "however , the estimated charge might have been affected by relatively coarse spatial resolution due to the limited computational power at that time .",
    "the q - ball charge distribution was studied in 2d  @xcite and 3d  @xcite lattices , with an emphasis on negative q - balls formed for an orbit with a large ellipticity . in gravity mediation",
    ", however , the ad field naturally acquires a large kick into the phase space , leading to an orbit with a comparatively small ellipticity . as we will see later",
    ", the formation of negative q - balls are also observed in our simulations for a large ellipticity .",
    "however , the final charge distribution does not fit well the empirical formula conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the entropy argument .",
    "the difference may be attributed to the fact that the charge re - distribution through exchanges of small secondary q - balls seems less efficient in our simulations .",
    "also the finite grid size could have affected the q - ball evolution especially at a very late time when one q - ball was represented by a single grid point . in our analysis",
    "we stop following the evolution once the spatial resolution becomes insufficient to describe the q - ball solution , in order to avoid any artificial effects due to the finite grid size .",
    "recently tsumagari studied the q - ball formation and thermalization processes in a great detail in a minkowski space neglecting the cosmic expansion @xcite . in an expanding universe",
    ", however , the thermalization processes through q - ball interactions may be weakened , and the resultant q - ball configuration could be quite different .",
    "we will see in the following that the cosmic expansion indeed plays an essential role in the q - ball formation .    in this paper",
    "we study the q - ball formation in a scalar potential motivated by the ad mechanism in gravity mediation and obtain the q - ball charge distribution on 1d , 2d and 3d lattice simulations with the cosmic expansion for different values of ellipticity and strength of instabilities .",
    "we develop a sophisticated numerical code based on the 6th - order symplectic integrator equipped with a new q - ball identification algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] , we summarize the governing equation of q - balls in the gravity - mediation model . in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the gravity - mediated susy breaking model , the ad field typically has a potential of the following form , @xmath4-ch^2|\\phi|^2 + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{m^{2n-6}}|\\phi|^{2n-2 } , \\label{eq : adpotential}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a complex scalar field parametrizing the flat direction , @xmath5 a coupling constant of the non - renormalizable term , @xmath6 the hubble parameter , @xmath7 a positive constant , @xmath8 a cutoff scale of the theory , @xmath9 the renormalization point defining the mass of scalar field @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the contribution from the one - loop correction chiefly due to gauginos  @xcite .",
    "the cut - off scale @xmath8 is typically taken as the gut scale @xmath12 gev or the planck scale .",
    "note that the potential ( [ eq : adpotential ] ) is invariant under the phase rotation of @xmath3 .",

    "the explicit form of the governing equation of @xmath3 becomes @xmath14    -ch^2\\phi + \\frac{(n-1 ) \\lambda^2}{m^{2n-6}}|\\phi|^{2n-4}\\phi = 0 , \\label{eq : adevo}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the spatial dimension , the dot indicates a time derivative , and @xmath16 is defined as the laplacian with respect to the comoving coordinate . in this paper , we restrict our analysis to the epoch between the end of inflation and the reheating era , where the scale factor behaves as @xmath17 like the matter - dominant case .",
    "in addition , the non - renormalizable term ( the last term being proportional to @xmath5 ) does not directly contribute to the late - time evolution of the scalar field , so we fix @xmath18 , and , for simplicity , @xmath19 .",
    "the charge density of the ad field is given by @xmath20 the charge and energy of a q - ball are given by @xmath21\\ , d^dx , \\label{eq : e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the @xmath15-dimensional volume of the q - ball .",
    "note that , from the dimensional analysis , these quantities in 1d and 2d should be regarded as the densities per unit area and length , respectively .    for a negative value of @xmath23 , the potential ( [ eq : adpotential ] ) is shallower than the quadratic potential @xmath24 , for which there exists a non - trivial field configuration that minimizes the energy for a fixed charge @xmath2 .",
    "we can find the solution using the lagrange multiplier method , and the minimum energy state turns out to be a spherical field configuration inside which the scalar field is rotating in a circular orbit in the phase space  @xcite .",
    "this object is called q - ball .",
    "there is an instability band for the potential with @xmath25 . from a simple linear analysis  @xcite",
    "one can show that the instability band is given by @xmath26 the small fluctuations @xmath27 within the above instability band will therefore grow into q - balls with a typical size @xmath28 .",
    "since the q - ball formation is a highly nonlinear phenomenon , we need to rely on numerical simulations to understand how it proceeds .",
    "the potential ( [ eq : adpotential ] ) is invariant under the u(1 ) rotation of @xmath3 , and therefore the charge @xmath2 is preserved . in general , however , there is a u(1)-violating term arising from the a - term @xmath29 .",
    "this term kicks the ad field into the angular direction at the onset of oscillations , giving a nonzero u(1 ) charge , or equivalently , the angular momentum in the complex @xmath3 plane [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) ] .",
    "since the amplitude of the oscillations decreases due to the hubble friction term , such non - renormalizable u(1)-violating terms soon become negligible .",
    "thus , the main role of the a - term is to give an initial angular momentum . to take account of the effect",
    ", we parametrize the initial condition of the homogeneous mode as @xmath30 the initial charge density is then @xmath31 . in the following analysis we take @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "also we add small fluctuations to the above initial condition , @xmath34 , following ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use a comoving box as a computational domain whose physical size at the initial time is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the hubble parameter at the initial time , and @xmath37 is a dimension - less parameter defining the box size .",
    "we choose the normalization of the scale factor as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the initial time , @xmath40 .",
    "we adopt a value between @xmath41 . in all simulations except for the partial cases ( 1d2 , 1d3 , 1d4 in table [ tab:1d ] ) in 1d",
    ", we use the equation of motion in an expanding background with an initial condition @xmath42 . in the non - expansion case , @xmath43 coincides with the physical scale . as for the computational grid ,",
    "we use the homogeneous @xmath44 grid , where @xmath15 is the dimension and @xmath45 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "other numerical parameters we used are tabulated in tables [ tab:1d]-[tab:3d ] . on the boundaries , we impose the periodic boundary condition .",
    "as the universe expands , the spatial resolution gets worse .",
    "the physical q - ball size is given by @xmath28  @xcite , and the grid spacing is @xmath51 . requiring @xmath52 during the simulations ,",
    "we obtain the critical time after which q - balls are no longer resolved , @xmath53 where @xmath54 measures the time normalized by @xmath55 from the beginning of the simulation , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "for example , we can resolve q - balls until @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in all simulations",
    "we have chosen the number of grids so that q - balls are resolved until @xmath60 .    to evolve @xmath3",
    ", we implement the 7 stages 6th - order symplectic integrator developed by yoshida @xcite .",
    "this scheme conserves the charge and energy of the target field , and the higher - order scheme is expected to suppress the global error , at least , until the epoch of the q - ball formation .",
    "the spatial derivatives , i.e. the laplacian operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adevo ] ) , are estimated with the second - order finite difference .",
    "we also implemented the fourier collocation method , and confirmed that the final results do not depend on the scheme of derivative .    in order to identify the formed q - balls",
    ", we developed an algorithm based on the marching cube method @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarized the algorithm in appendix b. our algorithm regards the region in which the charge density exceeds a critical value , @xmath61 , as a q - ball .",
    "this criterion is determined so that @xmath62 is sufficiently larger than the background field but smaller than the typical peak density .",
    "we set @xmath62 to be a fraction of @xmath63 when the fluctuations first enter the non - linear regime .",
    "in addition , we use opendx to visualize the q - balls in the 2d and 3d cases @xcite .",
    "[ [ subsec:1d ] ] 1d ~~      let us begin with the time - evolution of the ad field in 1d . for the sake of seeing the effect of the cosmic expansion particularly in 1d , we have performed simulations both with and without the cosmic expansion .",
    "first , we show the result with the cosmic expansion and explain how to identify q - balls .",
    "[ fig : field1d ] shows the charge density of the ad field at @xmath64 and @xmath65 with the parameter set 1d1 ( see table [ tab:1d ] ) .",
    "there are lots of peaks to be regarded as q - balls .",
    "these q - balls were formed at @xmath66 in this simulation when the background charge density has been decreased to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the initial value of @xmath3 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : init ] ) .",
    "once a q - ball is formed , its charge density at the center remains virtually unchanged unless there are significant collisions and mergers , since its physical size does not change in time and the total charge is preserved under the theory we consider here .",
    "actually , we can see that the peak values are more or less unchanged between @xmath64 ( red solid ) and @xmath69 ( green dashed ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : field1d ] .    at the formation ,",
    "the modes in the instability band ( [ eq : inst ] ) grow and become non - linear , and proto - q - balls are formed .",
    "those proto - q - balls absorb the surrounding charges , and the charge density outside q - balls are quickly damped .",
    "therefore if we set @xmath62 to be a fraction of @xmath70 , we can collect the q - balls . throughout this paper , we choose @xmath71 .",
    "the explicit value of @xmath62 depends on each simulation . in the present case , @xmath72 , which is drawn as the blue dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : field1d ] .",
    "using this criterion , we show the time evolution of the number of q - balls in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncount1d ] .",
    "the vertical axis is the number of q - balls in unit ( comoving ) length of the computational domain , @xmath73 .",
    "we found that there are approximately 5 q - balls in the unit comoving length ( normalized by @xmath10 ) , that is , totally @xmath74 q - balls in the whole domain with @xmath59 . to reduce the statistical error , we averaged 50 realizations .",
    "we can see that , after q - balls are formed at about @xmath75 , the number of q - balls remains constant for a while and then gradually decreases .",
    "the decrease is probably due to the merger or disruption process through collisions . in the 1d simulations , collisions among q - balls",
    "are expected to occur more frequently than in the cases with 2d or 3d , which enhances the probability that multiple q - balls merge into a large one .",
    "note that this is not due to the finite box effect , as will become clear from the following argument .",
    ".numerical parameters for 1d simulations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as for the spatial derivative , i.e. the laplacian operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adevo ] ) , we used the finite difference scheme called as 3- , 5- and 7-point formulas for 1d , 2d and 3d , respectively .",
    "for example , in the 3d cases , we replace the laplacian by @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "this derivative is computed at each stage just before the function evaluation .",
    "in order to identify a q - ball in the simulation box , we developed an identification method based on the marching cube algorithm with some modifications .",
    "the marching cube method has been frequently used in imaging analyses @xcite .",
    "we obtain the field data , @xmath78 , from the simulations , and can easily compute the charge density , @xmath79 , on the grid . in this charge density field , we regard the region in which the charge density exceeds the critical value , @xmath61 , as a q - ball . in accordance with the sign , we call positive q - ball @xmath80 and negative q - ball ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "looking closely at a grid cell containing a portion of q - ball boundaries , the boundary piece lies in the grid cell as shown , for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] .",
    "the left cell in the figure is an example of the case where there is only a grid point exceeding the critical value , represented by red sphere .",
    "the cyan triangle is a piece of the boundary of a q - ball , and the gray region represents the inner region of the q - ball .",
    "the right cell in the figure is an example of a case where there are four points exceeding the critical value .",
    "the location of the boundary , namely , the spatial coordinate satisfying @xmath82 on the sides of the grid cell , is determined by the linear interpolation between the adjacent grid points .",
    "in accordance with the spatial dimension , there are several patterns of the shape of q - ball boundary pieces in a grid cell . in the 1d case , there are only 1 pattern in which the boundary cuts a line segment ( 1d cell ) . in the 2d cases , we have 4 patterns : a triangle ( or , inversely , a pentagon ) , a trapezoid , a hexagon , and two triangles in a 2d cell .",
    "note that the last pattern indicates that there are parts of two q - balls in the cell . in the 3d cases , we have 14 patterns including fig .  [",
    "fig : cell ] .",
    "the all patterns in 3d are shown in figure 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our algorithm identifying q - balls is quite simple .",
    "first we seek local peaks of the charge density field satisfying @xmath83 , which are candidates of center of individual q - balls .",
    "then we seek the boundary outward from the cell containing the peak . at the same time , the energy density and charge density of each grid cell are computed .",
    "coming to the boundary , we classify the grid cell in the patterns mentioned in the previous paragraph , and compute the location of the boundary piece . finally , integrating the charge density and energy density over the region identified as a q - ball ,",
    "we obtain the charge , energy and the ( @xmath15-dimensional ) volume of the q - ball .",
    "the size ( diameter ) of the q - ball is calculated assuming that the shape of the q - ball is disk ( 2d ) or ball ( 3d ) with the same area ( 2d ) or volume ( 3d ) .",
    "hence the diameter of the q - balls is given by @xmath84{6v/\\pi } & \\mbox{\\rm for 3d } , \\end{cases } \\label{eq : diameter}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the @xmath15-dimensional volume .",
    "if by chance there are more than two peaks of the charge density field in the region satisfying @xmath83 , the present scheme counts redundantly multiple q - balls .",
    "hence , at the final stage of this algorithm , the redundant q - balls are eliminated .",
