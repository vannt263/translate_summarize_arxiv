    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard _ swift _ has revealed complex temporal behavior of the x - ray afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in the first few hours @xcite . this time window had been largely unexplored before the _ swift _ era , and studies of early afterglows have revealed many questions concerning grbs , such as the emission mechanism , nature of the central engine , and burst environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early x - ray afterglows have three phases , which was not predicted by the standard model from the pre-_swift _ era @xcite .",
    "_ phase  i : initial steep decay phase_. initially , the x - ray afterglow decays very steeply ; the most popular interpretation is that this is the tail emission of the prompt grb @xcite , although other possibilities have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ phase  ii : plateau phase_. at several hundreds of seconds after the burst trigger , this phase begins until @xmath2@xmath1 sec , whose origin is quite uncertain .",
    "this is the main topic of this letter .",
    "_ phase  iii : normal decay phase_. after the plateau phase ends , the x - rays subsequently decay with the decay index usually steeper than unity , as expected in the pre-_swift _ era . this decay behavior is well explained by the classical external shock model @xcite , in which neither the delayed energy injection nor the time dependency of shock microphysics is considered .",
    "phase  ii is the most enigmatic in early x - ray afterglows .",
    "so far , various kinds of models have been proposed such as the energy injection model @xcite , the inhomogeneous or two - component jet model @xcite , the time - dependent microphysics model @xcite , the reverse shock - dominated afterglow model @xcite , the prior activity model @xcite , the internal engine model @xcite , the cannonball model @xcite , and the dust scattering model @xcite . in this letter , another model of phase  ii",
    "is proposed .",
    "as described in the following , we consider a two - component emission model in which a prior and the main outflows emit x - rays independently ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] ) .",
    "one component is the prior emission via outflow ejected from the central engine before the main burst .",
    "this is responsible for phases ii and iii of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "this emission component arrives at the observer before the main burst triggering prompt grb detectors ( i.e. , the onset of grb ) such as bat onboard _",
    "swift_. it decays with time simply in a single power - law form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant and the time coordinate , @xmath5 , is measured in the rest frame of the observer .",
    "the epoch @xmath6 is taken around the time of arrival at the observer of the ( unseen ) information of the launch of the outflow at the central engine .",
    "this kind of a choice of the time zero is seen in many references ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the prior emission , @xmath7 , is not discussed in detail here .",
    "it can be either internal engine activity or external shock emission of the outflow .",
    "we set an observer time , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 corresponds to the onset of the prompt grb .",
    "the interval between the time @xmath6 and @xmath9 is assumed to be @xmath10  seconds , that is , @xmath11 .",
    "then , one obtains @xmath12 which becomes constant if @xmath13 , while @xmath14 when @xmath15 . in order to explain phases  ii and iii of the x - ray afterglow",
    ", @xmath10 should be @xmath16@xmath1  sec , and @xmath17 should be the temporal decay index of phase  iii .",
    "it is noted that the onset time of the prior emission is unknown .",
    "the first detectable x - rays from the prior component arrive at the observer in the time range @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this fact will be further discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : precursor ] .",
    "another remark is that from eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp0_mod ] ) alone , the introduction of @xmath10 shifts the origin of time .",
    "it has been known that , for phase  i , the choice of time zero affects the decay slope @xcite . the same argument for phase  ii is used for the first time in this letter .",
    "the other component is the main outflow , which causes the prompt grb emission and the subsequent phase  i of the x - ray afterglow . with time",
    "coordinate @xmath8 , phase  i of the x - ray afterglow is well approximated by a single power - law model given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant and @xmath22 .",
    "the whole light curve of the x - ray afterglow from phase  i to iii is described by the sum of the two components introduced above , that is , @xmath23 this is our formula for observed x - ray afterglows , where @xmath24 describes phases  ii and iii , while @xmath25 fits phase  i.    we find that by choosing appropriate values of the parameters , @xmath17 , @xmath26 , @xmath10 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 , the observed light curves of x - ray afterglows are well described with eq .",
    "( [ eq : compall ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit ] shows some examples of the fit .",
    "it is not surprising that our formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : compall ] ) , well explains the observational results of x - ray afterglows .",
    "the functional form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp0_mod ] ) is a good approximation of that introduced by @xcite : @xmath27\\exp(-t_a / t)~ , & t < t_a~ , \\\\ f_a(t / t_a)^{-\\alpha_a}\\exp(-t_a / t)~ , & t_a\\leq t~. \\end{array } \\right .   \\label{eq : will}\\ ] ] they have shown that the observed light curves of phases  ii and iii are well fitted with eq .",
    "( [ eq : will ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath28 becomes constant with @xmath8 if @xmath29 , while @xmath30 if @xmath31 .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that of @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , one can find that over a wide parameter range , @xmath32 for @xmath33 if we take @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in this letter , we have seen that for most events , phases  ii and iii of the observed light curves of the x - ray afterglow can be well fitted with a very simple formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp0_mod ] ) .",
    "in particular , the observational facts are that for most events , the transition from phase  ii to iii is slow and fairly smooth , and that the x - ray spectrum remains unchanged across the transition @xcite ; this can be naturally explained by our model because the transition from phase  ii to iii is an artifact of the choice of the time zero .",
    "a typical exception is grb  070110 ; at the end of the plateau phase  ii , the light curve shows an abrupt drop @xcite .",
    "such events may need other explanations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after phase  iii , subsequent fourth phase is occasionally observed : the so called _ post jet break phase _ ( _ phase  iv _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "its typical decay index is @xmath36 , satisfying the predictions of the jetted afterglow model @xcite .",
    "this phase  iv can also be clearly seen in our sample ( e.g. , grb  060428a ; upper right of fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "if the prior emission is from an external shock of the prior outflow , the jetted afterglow model is applied to the present case . as will be discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : mainag ] , the origin of the optical afterglow is different from the x - ray one , which explains the fact that the epoch of the jet break in the x - ray band is not generally the same as the optical one @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the characteristics of the transition from phase  ii to iii for 11 events with known redshifts .",
    "they derived the transition time , @xmath38 , and the isotropic luminosity at that time @xmath39 , and found that @xmath39 is well correlated with @xmath38 as @xmath40 .",
    "they adopt a broken power - law form to fit the light curve in phases  ii and iii which is different from that considered in this letter .",
    "however , we expect that their @xmath38 and @xmath39 roughly correspond to @xmath10 and @xmath37 , respectively , that are considered in   [ sec : model ] .",
    "indeed , one finds @xmath41 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp0_mod ] ) . hence , if @xmath42 which is a typical number for the decay index of phase  iii , we can reproduce the observed result of @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis has been done but with eq .",
    "( [ eq : will ] ) as the fitting formula @xcite . for 32 events with measured redshifts , they found a correlation between @xmath43 and the x - ray luminosity at the time @xmath43 , @xmath44 , as @xmath45 with @xmath460.74 . since @xmath47 and @xmath48 , their correlation indicates @xmath49 .",
    "the index @xmath50 is smaller than the typical value of @xmath17 ( @xmath511.5 ) .",
    "however , the claimed correlation has large scatter ( see figures  1 and 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may be explained by the scatter of @xmath17 in our model .",
    "there is a difference between the results of @xcite and @xcite . at present",
    ", the number of events with known redshifts may be small , so this discrepancy may be resolved if the number of events increases .",
    "@xcite studied the properties of prompt emission and x - ray afterglows of 23 grbs with known redshifts .",
    "they adopted eq .",
    "( [ eq : will ] ) in fitting phases  ii and iii of the x - ray afterglow , and found that for events with measured spectral peak energy @xmath52 , the time @xmath43 weakly correlates with the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath53 of the prompt grb emission .",
    "one can find from fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , that @xmath43 seems to be roughly proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "at present , this correlation is not firmly established because as noted by @xcite , there are no correlation between @xmath43 and the isotropic equivalent energy of prompt grbs in the 15 - 150  kev band for a larger sample of grbs with known redshift but unknown @xmath52 ( hence without @xmath54-correction ) .    the quantity @xmath53 correlates with @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "hence , if the @xmath43@xmath53 correlation exists , the bright grbs with large @xmath53 and @xmath52 have large @xmath43 , which is responsible for the distinct plateau phase .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray flashes or x - ray - rich grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have small @xmath43 ( @xmath55 ) , and have x - ray afterglow without phase  ii .",
    "this tendency could have been seen in @xcite .",
    "the above arguments may lead a link between long grbs and x - ray flashes / x - ray - rich grbs .",
    "suppose that the outflow ejection is not continuous but intermittent , i.e. , the central engine ejects two distinct outflows with a time interval of @xmath56 . just after the launch of the prior outflow , the central engine does not have enough energy for another outflow , so that it needs to store an additional one . during the time interval @xmath56 , matter surrounding the central engine",
    "is accreted , increasing the gravitational binding energy .",
    "this energy is released as the main outflow causing the prompt grb .",
    "it is expected that the larger is @xmath10 , the larger is the stored gravitational energy , resulting in a brighter burst with large @xmath53 . on the other hand , if @xmath10 is small the energy of the main outflow becomes small ; this is responsible for the x - ray flash or x - ray - rich grbs .",
    "further details will be discussed in the near future .",
    "the main outflow that is responsible for the prompt grb might cause external shock x - ray emission , @xmath57 . in the present two - component emission model , however , @xmath57 must be dimmer than the prior x - ray emission @xmath24 throughout phases  ii and iii .",
    "let us consider the simplest model of external shock emission of the main outflow .",
    "the relativistically expanding shell with energy @xmath58 interacts with the surrounding medium with uniform density @xmath59 , and emits synchrotron radiation with microphysics parameters at the shock , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "then , in the case of slow cooling and @xmath63 , the x - ray light curves are analytically calculated as @xmath64 , which is independent of @xmath59 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if @xmath65 , then @xmath57 hardly depends on @xmath62 . before the _ swift _ era",
    ", typical values had been @xmath66@xmath67  erg , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 so that the external shock emission reproduced the observed late - time x - ray afterglow . in the present case , @xmath57 must be dim , which implies small @xmath58 and/or @xmath61 .",
    "a similar discussion was made by @xcite .",
    "in some models , such as the energy injection model and the inhomogeneous jet model , prompt grb emission needs high radiation efficiency , which is defined by @xmath70 , because @xmath58 is small at the epoch of the prompt grb emission @xcite . as discussed here",
    ", @xmath57 can be dim if @xmath61 is small while @xmath58 remains large , @xmath71@xmath67  erg .",
    "hence , the present model could avoid a serious efficiency problem . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath58 of the outflow is small , the efficiency @xmath72 should be high .",
    "then the mechanism of prompt grb emission is unlike a classical internal shock model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed optical afterglow comes mainly from the prior outflow . for some events , the rising part of the early optical afterglow proceeds until @xmath73  sec @xcite , which is difficult to explain with prior emission . in the case of prior emission , the time zero would be shifted @xmath74@xmath1  sec before the burst trigger , making the light curve extraordinarily spiky .",
    "furthermore , in most cases , the transition from phase  ii to iii is chromatic , i.e. , the optical light curves do not show any break at that epoch @xcite , although there exist a few exceptions @xcite .",
    "hence , at least in the early epoch , the observed optical afterglow arises from the main outflow component or others , most likely an external shock emission .",
    "indeed , there have been some observational facts that indicate different origins of x - ray and optical afterglows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a possible prediction of the present model is a bright x - ray precursor before the prompt grb emission .",
    "let us assume that the prior x - ray emission starts at @xmath75  sec , although its onset time is fairly uncertain ( see   [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp0 ] ) , the x - ray flux in the 210  kev band is estimated as @xmath76erg  s@xmath77@xmath78 , where @xmath79 is taken as a typical value and the flux normalization constant @xmath4 is determined so that @xmath80  erg  s@xmath77@xmath78 at @xmath81  sec @xcite .",
    "such emission will be detected by monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ) .",
    "the expected event rate should be a few events per year @xcite .",
    "however , if the emission starts with @xmath75s , the predicted flux might be large enough to be detected by current instruments like bat onboard _",
    "swift_. in order to avoid this problem , the starting time of the emission should be comparable to or later than @xmath82  sec so that the peak flux is smaller than the detection limit of the prompt grb emission monitors .",
    "one possibility is off - axis jet emission in the context of the external shock model @xcite . due to the relativistic beaming effect ,",
    "the observed x - ray emission is dim as long as the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting outflow is larger than the inverse of the angle between the emitting matter and the observer s line of sight .",
    "this effect shifts the peak time of the x - ray emission toward the later epoch . for an appropriate choice of parameters",
    ", we may adjust the starting time ( the peak time ) of the x - ray emission .",
    "a signal of the onset of the prior emission might also be seen in the optical band .",
    "if the prior emission is extremal shock origin , the reverse shock emission might cause a bright optical flash @xcite .",
    "so far , for some events , widget has given observational upper limit on the prior optical emission , @xmath83  mag , about 750  seconds before the prompt emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further observations will constrain the model parameters . in summary , in order to test the model presented in this letter , the search for a signal in the data of sky monitors in the optical and x - ray bands is crucial .    r.y .",
