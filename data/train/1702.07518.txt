    "<S> further , we vary the mean sampling rate by random postselection of data points in recorded @xmath5 for fixed @xmath99@xcite , and show corresponding results and numerical simulations in fig.[fig3](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath100 continues to increase with increasing @xmath25 , and even diverges for @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> sampling rates that are too small to resolve fast dynamical features in @xmath5 result in a significant underestimation of @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> however , sampling rates that approach reasonable values overestimate @xmath76 due to the contribution of qpn and , correspondingly , @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the variable amount of @xmath23 can hamper a determination of  @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we demonstrate that an application of the non - markovianity measure @xmath22 to probe characteristics of @xmath1 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite , is still possible , when qpn is taken into account . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> we keep our parameters of @xmath0 and @xmath1 close to the simple regime and benchmark the ability of @xmath0 to probe @xmath0-@xmath1 couplings and variable states of @xmath1 . in a first measurement series , we probe changes in @xmath0-@xmath1 couplings by variation of @xmath74 near @xmath104 , for fixed @xmath105 , and determine @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> figure[fig4](a ) depicts @xmath107 for three distinct @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe resonances near @xmath82 that differ significantly in shape , depending on @xmath6 . for small @xmath6 , recorded @xmath22 feature a double - peak structure . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects an expected increase of the effective coupling rate @xmath109 ( faster dynamics ) for a detuning from resonance by @xmath110 , which can be estimated by @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for larger @xmath6 , line shapes become dominated by the resonant @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction , since amplitudes in @xmath4 are @xmath112 , i.e. , they are largest for @xmath113 , cf.@xcite . comparing our data to corresponding and true numerical results , we estimate @xmath114 on average with small variations , and we can experimentally resolve predicted features . in a second series of measurements , we probe the environmental state by tuning the initial @xmath31 . in figure[fig4](b ) , we depict experimental and numerical results of @xmath115 for @xmath108 and fixed @xmath82 , and compare them to the related true values . for short durations , </S>",
    "<S> we find an increase of @xmath116 for increasing @xmath31 , while for longer durations this trend changes and true values suggest a decrease of @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal that @xmath117 varies substantially between 0% and 45% , depending on @xmath6 and @xmath31 . for increasing @xmath31 , </S>",
    "<S> the spin interacts with a larger number of fock states and the evolution of @xmath5 features a less trivial frequency spectrum@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a faster and more complex dynamics @xmath4 that can not be resolved with constant significance for fixed @xmath91 and @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> while our results can be considered to be a textbook example , for increasingly complex or unknown states of @xmath1 and/or interactions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the quantification of @xmath23 becomes less trivial . </S>",
    "<S> leaving the regime of numerical tractability , it can be successful to experimentally record functions @xmath83 , as presented above . </S>",
    "<S> an estimation for @xmath118 may be obtained by extrapolating @xmath119 for varying @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed mathematical characterization of @xmath86 can assist such extrapolations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an estimation of @xmath23 can be achieved , e.g. , by optimizing semi - empirical models , which are designed to describe @xmath5 and tested to return recorded @xmath83@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , in combination with these models , fourier series of recorded @xmath4 may allow to isolate dynamics of interest from qpn . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , frequency filters or regularization methods may allow to estimate @xmath86@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but , we point out that an optimized strategy depends on technical limitations , excess noise levels , and properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we set up our trapped - ion system to implement an effective spin representing an open system , which we couple to an environment composed of a bosonic degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the evolution of the trace distance of two initially orthogonal spin states to study distinct features of quantum memory effects . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that inherent fluctuations , arising from random projection during the measurement process , yield not only uncertainties , but also a significant bias in the quantification of such effects . </S>",
    "<S> this affects any experimental platform and even numerical approaches , such as monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify this bias in our system to determine accurate values of the quantum non - markovianity measure . on the basis of these findings , </S>",
    "<S> we employ the open system as a local quantum probe to explore characteristics of system - environment couplings and environments . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental platform is ideal to tune to more complex environments and couplings@xcite , which includes adding spin or bosonic degrees of freedom , preparing a variety of initial environmental states , and engineering couplings to additional , even classical , surroundings . as such </S>",
    "<S> , it can act as a versatile reference and aids understanding of physical systems , in which parameters are less controlled , and other noise sources contribute substantially to an excess bias .    </S>",
    "<S> further , our fundamental findings lead to questions concerning generalizations and applications of non - markovianity . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of qpn on other measures , which are based on , e.g. , the divisibility of the dynamical map@xcite or the mutual information between the open system and an ancilla system@xcite , needs to be studied , as we expect them to be significantly influenced by qpn as well . </S>",
    "<S> overall , it may be practical to extend definitions of non - markovianity measures by including physical constraints , in order to enable a comparison of different systems . </S>",
    "<S> time scales and the related flow of exploitable information may depend on the application . in any case , </S>",
    "<S> an upper limit for the sampling rate may be given , e.g. , by the so - called quantum speed limit@xcite , which , in turn , would directly limit the impact of qpn . </S>",
    "<S> based on such extensions , applications for characterizing time scales and experimentally accessible complexity measures may emerge . </S>",
    "<S> these are needed , e.g. , in the context of equilibration dynamics and thermalization in isolated quantum systems@xcite .    </S>",
