    "the growing interest in systems of highly correlated electrons has proposed many theoretical descriptions where the dominant effects are treated in the frame of the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "since the exact solution of the model is known only in one dimension @xcite , and the majority of driving forces in the field , as superconductivity in cuprates , are two dimensional ( 2d ) problems , a great variety of approximate treatments have been proposed @xcite in order to accommodate a suitable theoretical framework . despite several years of intensive studies",
    ", it is apparent that the necessary theoretical skills and tools to deal with this problem are still in fact relatively poor @xcite .",
    "while most of the ongoing effort relating the hubbard model is being concentrated on the general case of large electron density , more than ten years ago it has been recognized that the less analysed low - density limit not only that retain main aspects related to the model behaviour @xcite , but can provide key knowledge which could drive further at least nonperturbative developments @xcite , firstly because is more hope to find non - approximated solutions holding by their nature essential information .",
    "the history of this background has started with the exact solution of the two - electron ground state problem on an arbitrary large torus @xcite , solution of the two electron problem in 2d @xcite , and continued with the three electron problem extended nonperturbatively in the low density limit @xcite .",
    "the numerical treatment of the four electron problem on four sites follows by the test of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer and resonant - valence - bond wave functions as approximated ground states of the hubbard model @xcite , test of the unrestricted hartree - fock solution @xcite , the calculation of huckel - hubbard correlation diagrams @xcite , and deduction of absorption spectra of tcnq particles @xcite .",
    "the concurrently made numerical developments on @xmath1 clusters around half filling @xcite corroborated by group - theoretical studies of the @xmath1 square system @xcite also lead to the development of the numerical description of the @xmath2 particle problem for energy level statistics @xcite . in the last years",
    "the study of symmetry properties for hubbard clusters in general has continued @xcite , extensions to hubbard - holstein model for clusters holding 4 electrons has been given @xcite , and for spinless fermion case numerical characterization of the 4 particle problem goes up to clusters of @xmath3 extension @xcite . despite the invested efforts , exact analytical results holding essential information are not known at the moment in the problem .",
    "the last period has provided strong new motivations for the further development of the study of the low concentration limit of the hubbard model .",
    "the reason for this is that experimentally one started to encounter in condensed matter context rapidly increasing situations containing small number of particles confined in a system or device , as for example in the case of quantum dots @xcite , quantum well structures @xcite , mesoscopic systems @xcite , experimental entanglement @xcite etc . between the studied experiments , several",
    "are directly connected to the hubbard model , as in the case of charge transfer complexes @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , or mesoscopic grains @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed that several measurements on strongly correlated systems are acceptable reproduced on small hubbard clusters , as in the case of the x - ray absorption for nickelates studied on 4-site cluster @xcite .",
    "the same can be stated for the @xmath1 cluster case used in describing manganites @xcite , photoemission intensities @xcite , or thermodynamic properties provided by processes in the vicinity of the fermi surface @xcite .    as can be observed , the accumulated knowledge to the present date regarding the extreme low density limit described by few particles present in the system , excepting the one and two particle cases , means only symmetry properties , and numerical results ( often approximated ) , which usually conceal explicit properties which could generate creative advancement at the level of the theoretical description and deep understanding .",
    "this is a regrettable and unfortunate situation , since as is known from the accumulated experience in solving exactly many - body systems @xcite , or as several times has been accentuately stressed @xcite , key aspects of the unapproximated descriptions are often hidden in the few particle cases .    on the presented background , with the aim to fill up at least partially this gap for the two dimensional hubbard case , and being driven by the intention to provide essential information for the subjects mentioned above , we present the exact ground state of four interacting electrons in a @xmath1 hubbard cluster .",
    "our main purpose is not to hide potential essential characteristics behind numerical results , but to present explicit expressions , basic resulting properties , and visible characteristics , which we strongly hope , are able to polarize the creative thinking , and advancement in the field .",
    "our results are based on an @xmath0 space description , which in our opinion is unjustly overshaded in the last period in treating such problems , in contradiction with its deep ability to bring to light essential characteristics .",
    "we construct first a base vector set starting from symmetry properties , and then show how a closed system of linear equations containing 85 components can be constructed characterizing the ground state manifold and providing by its secular equation , through its minimum eigenvalue , the ground state wave function and ground state energy .",
    "after this step the properties of the ground state are analyzed .",
    "the concretely described situation is an @xmath4 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions in both directions , and @xmath5 particles .",
    "but the method itself works for arbitrary even number of particles and arbitrary even @xmath6 .",
    "the explicitly presented base vectors and equations providing the ground state , not only show how the ground state can be constructed and what kind of components build it up , but provides an insight into other properties of the spectrum as well .",
    "especially the characteristics regarding the kinetic energy eigenstates should be mentioned on this line , important for understanding aspects related to perturbative expansions , or kinetic energy driven superconductivity .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is structurated as follows .",
    "section ii . presents the hamiltonian , the deduction procedure and the ground state wave functions , section iii . describes physical properties of the deduced eigenstates , sect .",
    "iv . presents the conclusions of the paper , while the appendices a - b presenting mathematical details , close the presentation .",
    "the hamiltonian we use has the form of a standard hubbard hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 creates an electron at site @xmath9 with spin @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the nearest - neighbour hopping amplitude , @xmath12 is the on - site coulomb repulsion , and @xmath13 represents nearest - neighbour sites , taken into account in the sum over sites only once . during our study",
    "we consider an @xmath14 cluster , @xmath15 , with periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "all the presented results will relate @xmath16 , the only one microscopic parameter of the problem being @xmath17 .",
    "the case @xmath18 will be presented in details , although the method is applicable for arbitrary even @xmath19 . since @xmath5 ,",
    "the band filling for the presented case is @xmath20 .",
    "we further mention that we consider during this paper @xmath21 .        in order to describe the hilbert space region containing the ground state for the @xmath5 particle problem",
    ", we use an @xmath0-space representation for the wave vectors . in order to characterize this ,",
    "first the lattice sites of the considered system are numbered starting from the down - left corner , the numbering being given along the lower lattice sites line , then going upward with the notation , as shown in fig.1.a . in the considered system ( taking into account that the ground state is a singlet state ) , three type of particle configurations may occur as depicted in fig.1.b , c , d .",
    "\\1 ) we can have two double occupancies at sites @xmath9 and @xmath22 represented by two dots at sites @xmath9 and @xmath22 ( see fig.1.b ) .",
    "2 ) we may have a double occupancy at site @xmath9 and two electrons with opposite spins at sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in this case , the double occupancy at site @xmath9 it is denoted as before by a dot at @xmath9 , while the two electrons with opposite spins placed on the different sites ( @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) are depicted by a dotted line connecting the sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see fig.1.c ) .",
    "finally , we may have four single occupancies placed on different sites . from these , the electrons placed at @xmath9 and @xmath22 have spin @xmath10 , while the electrons at sites @xmath23 and @xmath24 have spin @xmath25 .",
    "this situation will be represented by two continuous lines connecting the sites @xmath9 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ( see fig.1.d ) .",
    "the notations @xmath26 are representing the numbering of the sites as specified in fig.1.a .",
    "the mathematical expressions connected to the states represented in fig.1.b , c , d are given as follows .",
    "the two double occupancies present in fig.1.b provide the state @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the bare vacuum with no fermions present . the one double occupancy and the two electrons with opposite spins depicted in fig.1.c",
    "are described as @xmath29 |0\\rangle \\ : .",
    "\\label{ez3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the here presented situation we must have @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . finally , in describing mathematically the four single occupancies presented in fig.1.d , we have @xmath32 |0\\rangle , \\label{ez4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for the mathematical clarity , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is required ( all sites being considered different ) .      in order to construct the base vectors , the basic wave vector elements are translated by the operation @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath35 operator is considered a linear operator , hence the relation @xmath36 holds , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent particle configurations as depicted in fig.1.b , c , d .",
    "furthermore @xmath39 means that the configuration of particles represented by @xmath37 is translated to each site of the system ( for @xmath18 , the translation is made 16 times ) , and the obtained contributions are all added ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the argument of the @xmath35 operator contains usually four terms since the starting particle configuration is rotated by 180 degrees along the @xmath40 , and @xmath41 axes , and then the obtained contributions are added .",
    "less than four terms in the @xmath35 argument means that the mentioned rotations provide the same starting particle microconfiguration .",
    "the translations are such effectuated that the relative inter - particle positions are all maintained , and arriving near the border of the system , the presence of the periodic boundary conditions are explicitly taken into account .",
    "the translations must be given at the level of the graphic plots , all the obtained @xmath42 graphics must be added ( see fig.2 ) , then each graphic must be transformed in a mathematical form according to the rules presented in eqs.([ez2]-[ez4 ] ) . at this point",
    "we must underline , that when the mathematical expression is written for a given graph , a negative sign may emerge in some cases given by the restrictions prescribed for eqs.([ez2]-[ez4 ] ) .",
    "for example , the last two terms in both rows of fig.3 have mathematical expressions with negative sign .",
    "similar reasons lead to sign changes obtained after rotations , reason which generates the sign changes observed in some @xmath43 arguments of base vectors presented in figs.4 - 18 , for example in the case of the second contributions of @xmath44 , or @xmath45 , etc .",
    "furthermore , in some cases ( see for example @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) , the rotations provide the starting microconfiguration of particles , which leads to the decrease of the number of terms present in the argument of the @xmath35 operation .",
    "the sign changes also lead in some cases to complete elimination of some possible particle microconfigurations .",
    "starting from the rules and operations described in details in sec.ii.b.1-2 , the 85 base wave vectors can be explicitly constructed as given in fig.4 - 18 .",
    "these are denoted by @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and are all orthogonal vectors . as can be seen ,",
    "the base wave vectors are obtained by subtracting two type of contributions .",
    "the first part of these is obtained from a starting particle microconfiguration ( presented as first terms in the argument of the first operator @xmath35 ) which is rotated by 180 degrees along the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath41 axes , and translated by the operation @xmath35 after this step .",
    "the second ( subtracted ) part of the wave vectors is obtained from the first part by a rotation of the elements by 90 degree along the @xmath41 axis .",
    "first of all we are constructing a closed system of equations containing the base vectors described above .    this system of 85 equations is obtained as follows .",
    "i ) we start from the most _ condensed _ and most _ interacting _ particle microconfiguration depicted by the base vector @xmath52 ( see fig.4 ) , which can not be eliminated on physical grounds from the ground state .",
    "ii ) by applying the hamiltonian on the base vector @xmath52 ( see the first equation of appendix a ) , we obtain as a result new base vectors ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , which have the same symmetry properties as @xmath52 .",
    "iii ) since the hamiltonian does not change the symmetry properties of the base vectors , one must further apply @xmath55 on the each resulting new base vector , up to the moment in which the obtained system of equations closes .",
    "this happens for the studied system at the 85th equation .",
    "the obtained closed system of equations is explicitly presented in appendix a. the minimum energy solution of the presented system of equations represents the ground state of the system .",
    "first of all one can check that the system of equations presented in appendix a indeed provides the ground state of the problem .",
    "the obtained minimum eigenvalues provided by appendix a are @xmath56 which perfectly coincide with the numerically exact minimum eigenvalues obtained from exact numerical diagonalization in the 14 400 dimensional full hilbert space @xcite .",
    "we note that the eigenvalues are given in @xmath11 units .",
    "the study of the solutions of the system of equations presented in eq.([a1 ] ) leads to an extremely interesting observation , namely that almost half ( exactly 40% ) of the eigenstates are @xmath12 independent , consequently are eigenstates of the non - interacting system as well .",
    "for example , the @xmath12 independent @xmath57 eigenvectors corresponding to zero eigenvalue are presented in appendix b. besides these , one has also @xmath42 eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath58 , which are also @xmath12 independent ( see exemplification in appendix b ) .",
    "the presence of such eigenstates is important for following reasons .",
    "first of all , several authors observed @xcite that weak coupling expansions often provide a good approximation for the hubbard model at intermediate coupling .",
    "a possible explication for this is the emergence of a huge number of eigenstates in the spectrum of the hubbard model with non - zero interaction , which are present in the non - interacting case as well in the spectrum of the model .",
    "a second aspect which must be mentioned here is that the eigenstates related to zero eigenvalue presented in appendix b are in fact many - body eigenstates of the kinetic energy term with no double occupancy .",
    "such states apparently totally avoid double occupancy at no cost of energy , consequently are important in the study of the pairing mechanism in the hubbard model @xcite , and as seen from the presented results , easily emerge in the spectrum .    at this step",
    "we underline that contrary to the practice used in the theoretical studies up to this moment @xcite , double occupancy avoiding eigenstates emerge not only at zero energy , but also at much lower energy values , closely situated to the ground state energy .",
    "we exemplify this statement by the eigenstate @xmath59 presented in eq.([b2 ] ) , corresponding to energy @xmath60 ( in @xmath11 units ) .",
    "these eigenstates being @xmath12 independent , their energy remain unchanged if the strength of the on - site interaction is increased , while the ground - state energy increases if @xmath12 is increased .",
    "consequently , starting from these states , the contribution in the pairing mechanism of the kinetic energy eigenstates not containing double occupancy could be much more efficiently taken into account than considered up today .",
    "we note that this problem has interconnections to the problem of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity as well , strongly debated in the literature in the last period @xcite .",
    "indeed , experimentally is observed @xcite that especially in @xmath61 based cuprates , a decrease in the kinetic energy is observed at the superconducting transition , which contradicts the usual ( for example bcs ) pairing theories @xcite .",
    "if the pairing process could be described on the states of the type @xmath59 , exemplified in our knowledge in exact terms for the first time in this paper , a such a decrease could be much better understood .",
    "the major part of the spectrum ( 60% ) is @xmath12 dependent . from the eigenstates entering in this category , there are states whose eigenvalue is exactly @xmath62 , for example @xmath63 .",
    "such states are interesting for two reasons .",
    "first , a detection possibility of such states would lead to a direct experimental measurement of the @xmath64 ratio .",
    "second , since all the contributions in @xmath65 have double occupancy @xmath66 , this vector is also an eigenstate of the interaction term with eigenvalue @xmath62 , and in the same time , the eigenvector of the kinetic energy term with eigenvalue zero .",
    "consequently , the study of the zero kinetic energy eigenvalue states must be given with care , since such type of states , as exemplified before , not necessarily are avoiding the double occupancy .",
    "the remaining part of the deduced @xmath12 dependent states , are not eigenstates of the kinetic energy , and the interacting part of @xmath55 separately , but are eigenvectors only for the sum of both , e.g. the whole hamiltonian . as seen from eq.([ez6 ] ) , the corresponding eigenvalues have a smooth ( less than linear ) @xmath12 dependence , and the ground states is obtained from this category .      in order to enhance further developments and enlighten further creative thinking",
    ", we provide explicitly in appendix a the equations generating the ground state , together with the explicit form of the base vectors providing the ground state ( see figs.4 - 18 ) , hence describing the hilbert space region in which this is placed .",
    "we mention that if the base vectors are defined only through the operation @xmath35 , without subtracting two @xmath35 components as shown in figs.4 - 18 , a system containing 176 equations arises .",
    "this however can be cast in two block diagonal components , one of which provides the equations presented in appendix a.",
    "driven by the aim to provide explicit expressions generating creative developments , we present exact analytical results describing the ground state of the two dimensional hubbard model taken on an @xmath67 square lattice at @xmath18 ( and periodic boundary conditions in both directions ) , containing @xmath5 particles .",
    "the presented procedure allows the description of an arbitrary even @xmath6 and @xmath68 , and is based on symmetry adapted base vectors constructed in @xmath0 space .",
    "the hamiltonian acting on the described base vectors provides a closed system of linear equations ( whose number is 85 for @xmath18 and @xmath5 ) , leading by its secular equation , through its minimum eigenvalue , to the ground state wave function and ground state energy of the system , deduced in a hilbert subspace with almost three orders of magnitude smaller in dimensions than the full hilbert space of the problem .",
    "the deduced explicit eigenstates characterize also other properties of the spectrum : i ) the large number of eigenstates which remain eigenstates of the non - interacting hamiltonian as well shows why weak coupling expansions often provide a good approximation for the hubbard model at intermediate coupling .",
    "ii ) zero energy eigenstates of the kinetic energy term ( @xmath69 ) which are eigenstates of the hamiltonian as well show how energy increasing double occupancies can be avoided providing a possible support for the kinetic energy driven superconductivity .",
    "iii ) low energy eigenstates of the kinetic energy term which completely avoid double occupancy emphasize potentially new pairing possibilities in the low energy part of the spectrum in the context of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity .",
    "iv ) zero energy eigenstates of the kinetic energy term corresponding to double occupancy one underline that the zero energy @xmath69 eigenstates must be handled with care , since as exemplified , these states not necessarily represent double occupancy avoiding states .",
    "similarly obtained solutions for higher @xmath6 or @xmath68 , corroborated with the study of the emerging changes in the system of equations describing the ground state , remain a challenge for future developments .",
