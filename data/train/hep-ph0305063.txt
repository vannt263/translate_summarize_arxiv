    "therefore , is already good enough to constrain exotic contributions .",
    "indeed , it is already routinely used to check whether particular directions of parameter space of supersymmetric extensions of the sm are viable or not .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , new loop contributions to the two radiative decays of the @xmath14 meson , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , come  @xcite from the charged - higgs boson , charginos , gluino and neutralino .",
    "their contributions are often comparable to or even larger than the sm one .",
    "the inclusion of qcd corrections to these contributions  @xcite , however , is far from having reached the level of precision already achieved in the sm , at least for generic regions of the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "the latest development in this direction has been the observation that the susy - qcd corrections by squark - gluino subloops can be significant when @xmath1 is very large  @xcite .    in this talk , we focus on the contribution of the charged - higgs boson @xmath25 and analyze these two - loop susy - qcd corrections .",
    "so far , only the nondecoupling parts of these corrections have been evaluated , by using an effective two - higgs - doublet ( 2hd ) lagrangian where squarks and gluino are integrated out  @xcite .",
    "subleading parts of these corrections , i.e. of order @xmath26 , generated by higher - dimensional operators in the effective lagrangian , were omitted in these studies , although they could give potentially large contributions when @xmath3 is nonnegligible with respect to the typical supersymmetric mass @xmath4 .    here",
