    "this approximation is only possible up to the @xmath11 order , whereas for a system with equal charge- to - mass ratio ( with @xmath12 ) the approximation goes up to order @xmath13 . using lagrange s equation of motion , it is then straightforward to obtain a numerical result for the deflection angle and the elastic cross section .",
    "explicit expressions for these lagrangians are given in ref .",
    "the authors show that the scattering angle increases by up to 6% when relativistic corrections are included in @xmath14 collisions at 100 mev / nucleon .",
    "the effect on the elastic scattering cross section is even more drastic : @xmath15 for center - of - mass scattering angles around 0 - 4 degrees .",

    "@xcite is that the effects of relativity can be taken into account in a much simpler way when the projectile is a light particle scattering on a heavy target ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) . in this case",
    ", the main contribution of relativistic corrections ( up to 80% of the total effect ) is due to the changes in masses , an easily implementable correction . only about 20% of the relativistic effects are due to magnetic interactions and retardation .",

    "however at energies around 50 to 100 mev / nucleon , accelerator energies common to most radioactive beam facilities ( msu , riken , gsi , ganil ) , it is very important to use a correct treatment of recoil and relativistic effects , both kinematically and dynamically . at these energies",

    "the treatment of the strong interaction in nucleus - nucleus collisions at intermediate and high energies is evidently much more complicated than the case of coulomb excitation , described in the previous section .",
    "fortunately , many direct nuclear processes , e.g. nucleon knockout , or stripping , elastic breakup ( diffraction dissociation ) , etc , are possible to study using the optical limit of the glauber theory , in which the nuclear ground - state densities and the nucleon - nucleon total cross sections are the main input .",
    "in fact , this method has become one of the main tools in the study of nuclei far from stability @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the eikonal ( or glauber ) methods only use the dependence of the scattering matrices , @xmath64 , on the transverse direction , @xmath29 .",
    "transverse directions are always lorentz invariants .",

    "nucleus - nucleus scattering at high energies is not simply an incoherent sequence of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "since the nucleons are confined within a box ( inside the nucleus ) , lorentz contraction induces a collective effect : in the extreme limit @xmath83 all nucleons would interact at once with the projectile .",
