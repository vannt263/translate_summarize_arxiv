    "<S> still the transition can not be tied to a symmetry breaking as in the landau theory of continuous pts . </S>",
    "<S> absence of symmetry breaking in continuous pts has previously been discussed in terms of topological pts where a local order parameter can not be assigned to the system  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we do introduce a ` local ' order parameter in the magnetization , but it should not be taken as an order parameter in the strict sense since it can not be associated to a symmetry in the first place . </S>",
    "<S> recently the physics behind symmetry breaking in dissipation driven pts has been explored  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> why the present model does not belong to their rather general results is because it does not support a symmetry to start with , i.e. one can observe continuous ness pts even in systems lacking symmetries . in classical systems , </S>",
    "<S> non - equilibrium pts may take place without breaking of any symmetry , but these transitions are typically dynamical , which means that the system evolution can display non - analytic behavior upon changing some parameter  @xcite . as a next step , our results should be tested on more general grounds , i.e. not for a fully connected model but a local one , for example those of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that the same type of behavior will be recovered also in these models .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical realization of our model was discussed in detail in  @xcite , and with the present experiments with cold atomic condensates loaded in optical resonators  @xcite or raman coupled cold atomic gases  @xcite it should indeed be possible to reach the critical point with these setups . both setups have the advantage that the internal energy between the atomic states can be tuned to zero . </S>",
