    "the discovery of high-@xmath9 superconductors has generated great interest in models of strongly correlated insulators in low dimensions , both in the presence and absence of doped carriers . while in two dimensions",
    "the problem remains challenging even for the most elementary models that are believed to capture some of the physics of the cuprates , much can be learned from the study of one - dimensional counterparts of such models .",
    "basic features that characterize the high-@xmath9 materials , such as the absence of a quasiparticle pole near the fermi surface and possibly spin - charge separation , are essential to one - dimensional systems and are well understood here @xcite .",
    "the success of the theory in one dimension is due to the availability of powerful exact methods , such as numerical diagonalization and bethe ansatz , in combination with the knowledge of a low - energy effective theory which has so far been found to describe all gapless degrees of freedom in one - dimensional systems , the luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work we study the effect of doping a small concentration of holes into a dimerized spin chain .",
    "this is motivated by the idea that in a dimerized system , there naturally exists an amplitude for pair formation . upon introduction of carriers",
    "phase coherence may be established , resulting in superconductivity .",
    "this idea has been previously proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we distinguish between two rough physical pictures of hole doping into a dimerized chain ( fig .",
    "[ models ] ) . in the first scenario ( fig .",
    "[ models]a ) ) the dimer order remains long ranged even after hole doping . the dimers tend to reside on every second link of the lattice as in the symmetry broken undoped state , and holes tend to pair on the empty sites in between .",
    "a ) doping into frozen dimer state .",
    "ovals represent singlet pairs .",
    "b ) mobile dimers with domain walls.,width=316 ]        we note that this case bears some resemblance to doped ladder models @xcite .",
    "indeed strong superconducting correlations have been proposed for dimer - models with explicit symmetry breaking @xcite . +",
    "a second possibility is that the holes enter as domain walls between different dimer phases ( fig.[models]b ) .",
    "then the long - range order of dimers is destroyed , but the singlet gap remains .",
    "if the holes are mobile and become phase coherent , this leads to superconductivity in analogy with the original rvb scenario @xcite .",
    "however , the pictures presented in fig . [ models ] are based on the limit of large @xmath4 . in physical systems , on the other hand , @xmath4 is usually a fraction of unity . in this regime , the hole kinetic energy is dominant and it is less clear intuitively if the dimer picture discussed above applies . in the present paper ,",
    "we study this question in the context of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-model in one dimension : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is a projection operator that enforces the constraint of no doubly occupied sites .",
    "the @xmath12 are spin-@xmath13 operators , and the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 are assumed positive throughout this paper .",
    "in addition , we have included a nearest neighbor interaction @xmath14 for later convenience .    at finite doping ,",
    "not much is known analytically about this model due to its non - integrable nature .",
    "the phase diagram has been established numerically @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ phas ] ) .",
    "however , in the regime around @xmath15 where the undoped spin chain is strongly dimerized and which is of particular interest to us , we feel that the numerics are somewhat inconclusive for small doping @xmath3 and @xmath16 as we will discuss below .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first , in the case of strong frustration @xmath15 we wish to determine the fate of the various regions present in the phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-model at small doping and small @xmath4 ( fig.[phas]c ) . in particular , we will answer the question whether a regime of dominant singlet superconducting correlations in the vicinity of an instability towards phase separation persists to values @xmath17 and in the dilute hole limit .",
    "this would happen if all the contours in fig .",
    "[ phas]c ) extrapolate to the origin , which appears to be a possible interpretation of the numerics . to this end",
    ", we introduce a perturbative approach valid in this limit .",
    "we find that the scenario mentioned above does not occur , but instead the luttinger liquid is stable for small @xmath4 and small doping .",
    "luttinger liquid arguments will then imply that strong superconducting correlations only exist above a finite critical value of @xmath4 .",
    "+ second , below the critical value @xmath18 the liquid phase is stable in the limit @xmath19 , and we will use our method to demonstrate certain properties that one expects to hold for one - dimensional lattice models based on general grounds . in particular , spin and charge are expected to correspond to separate degrees of freedom and any microscopic coupling between them should be irrelevant . as a consequence ,",
    "dilute holes that are doped into a correlated spin chain should act as a gas of non - interacting spinless solitons@xcite , where the coupling to the non - trivial spin background only gives rise to a renormalization of the effective hole mass .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in integrable models such as the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "our perturbative approach allows us to give a demonstration of the same behavior in the non - integrable @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-model , and to calculate the effective energy and mass renormalization of the hole for small @xmath4 .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce the model , briefly discuss the numerical phase diagram and cast the model into a language where holes are interpreted as domain walls . in section [ pert ]",
    "we treat the spin - charge couplings as a perturbation and derive expressions for the ground - state energy , compressibility and kohn stiffness of the model for small @xmath4 , @xmath5 and small doping @xmath3 .",
    "this will allow us to qualitatively continue the numerical phase diagram into the region of small doping . in section [ eval ]",
    "we will explicitly evaluate these expressions as asymptotic series in powers of @xmath3 and @xmath7 , demonstrating the convergence of our approach . in section [ polaron ]",
    "we discuss the single polaron energy and mass renormalization .",
    "we introduce a spin polaron type variational wave function where the hole is surrounded by a cloud of tightly bound triplet excitations and find good agreement with our perturbative results .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "appendix [ convapp ] illustrates the behavior of our expansion at general order in various limits .",
    "an important technical issue is discussed in appendix [ fcontin ] .",
    "we wish to study the hamiltonian ( [ tjj ] ) in the limit of vanishing exchange couplings and doping . for @xmath20",
    "the phase zero temperature diagram of ( [ tjj ] ) has been obtained numerically @xcite for various values of the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the results are sketched in fig .",
    "[ phas ] ) .",
    "these phase diagrams show a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tl ) region below the dashed line labeled spin gap , where both spin and charge degrees of freedom are gapless . above the dashed line",
    "there is a spin gapped liquid phase which is subdivided into a regime of dominant singlet superconducting ( ss ) correlations ( shaded grey ) and , where present , a regime of dominant charge - density - wave correlations ( cdw ) . also shown",
    "are contours of constant values of the luttinger parameter @xmath22 . above the @xmath22 line labeled @xmath23 ,",
    "there is a region of phase separation ( ps ) , where the ground state has a phase boundary between a hole - rich and an electron - rich phase .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is directly related to the large distance behavior of the various correlation functions of a luttinger liquid : for @xmath24 pairing correlations dominate over density - wave correlations , otherwise density - wave correlations dominate .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of a spin gap , triplet pairing correlations and spin - density - wave correlations are exponentially suppressed . in this region ,",
    "the main competition is therefore between cdw and ss correlations , which in the presence of a spin gap decay as @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively @xcite .",
    "+ at zero doping ( @xmath27 ) it is well known that the spin chain undergoes a phase transition at a critical value of @xmath28 ( ref . )",
    "above which the ground state is dimerized with a gap in the spin excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "for @xmath29 this spin gap remains present over a finite range of doping for any value of @xmath4 , as was shown in ref .. fig .",
    "[ phas ] shows that at @xmath30 the spin gapped region has considerable overlap with the pairing region @xmath24 even at small values of doping @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , it appears from the numerics as if all @xmath22 contours , including the phase separation boundary @xmath31 , flow to small values of @xmath4 at small @xmath3 ( cf . refs . ) .",
    "one expects that these contours will focus on a critical point @xmath32 $ ] , as was proposed in ref . for the @xmath0-@xmath1-model ( @xmath33 , fig .",
    "[ phas]a ) ) .",
    "a possibility that seems consistent with the numerics at @xmath30 is that @xmath34 , i.e. all contours flow into the origin of the phase diagram . in this case ,",
    "a sufficiently small amount of doping would always lead to phase separation , and upon further doping one would enter a region of dominant ss correlations .",
    "alternatively , @xmath18 could be finite but possibly smaller than its value at @xmath35 , which is between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ phas]a ) .",
    "this would imply that the above phenomenology of phase separation and superconductivity at small doping occurs only for @xmath38 , while for @xmath39 the liquid phase is stable at any doping @xmath3 . in the latter case , one would expect the luttinger parameter @xmath22 to approach the value @xmath13 in the dilute hole limit @xmath19 , which is the value corresponding to non - interacting spinless degrees of freedom .",
    "this behavior is clearly exemplified by the numerical phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1-model ( fig .",
    "[ phas]a ) .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to determine which of these two scenarios applies to the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model at @xmath29 .",
    "+ we begin our analysis by casting the hamiltonian ( [ tjj ] ) into a language where the holes play the role of domain walls between broken segments of an infinite spin chain ( fig . [ cluster ] ) .",
    "we consider a lattice of @xmath40 sites with a number of @xmath41 electrons and @xmath42 holes .",
    "domain wall representation of the hilbert space .",
    "the upper chain represents the spin sector with sites labeled by i. the holes live on a lattice of interstitial sites labeled by j. crosses represent `` empty '' interstitial sites , circles represent holes between two spins.,width=316 ]    denoting the @xmath43th spin on the lattice by @xmath12 we may regard the spins as residing on a `` squeezed '' lattice where the hole sites have been dropped from the system and the label @xmath43 of the spin @xmath12 is a site label in this squeezed space , as in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] ) .",
    "we also introduce interstitial sites for the squeezed spin lattice whose labels @xmath44 differ from those of the spin sites by @xmath13 .",
    "each interstitial site may accommodate a number @xmath45 of holes . a faithful representation of the hilbert space of ( [ tjj ] ) is given by states labeled by @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the z - component of the spin @xmath12 .",
    "this language turns out to be particularly convenient when one introduces a large nearest neighbor hole repulsion , i. e. if we let @xmath48 in ( [ tjj ] ) , such that it is forbidden for two holes to occupy neighboring sites . in the present language",
    "this means that the occupancy of the hole cluster labeled by @xmath49 is now restricted to be @xmath50 .",
    "this modification of the model will be irrelevant in the dilute hole limit which we are interested in the ( ps ) region consists of an insulating @xmath27 phase ( no holes ) and a liquid phase with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the critical doping at which phase separation just occurs .",
    "since @xmath52 is small in the region of interest , it is justified to consider the holes as dilute even in the ( ps ) regime . ] .",
    "we may now choose to formulate the hole dynamics either in terms of hard - core boson operators or spinless fermion operators .",
    "for convenience , we introduce fermion ladder operators @xmath53 , @xmath54 , where the action of @xmath54 can be described by cutting the spin chain open at the interstitial site @xmath49 , introducing a hole at this position and multiplying the state by an appropriate fermion phase .",
    "the hole kinetic energy is then simply given by    @xmath55    ( [ hc ] ) can be thought of as the @xmath56 limit of the hamiltonian . in the other limit of interest , namely the limit of zero doping @xmath57",
    ", the hamiltonian becomes that of a pure spin chain :    @xmath58    where we work at constant @xmath59 from now on , and assume that @xmath29 , such that the small doping regime is spin gapped .",
    "the combined hamiltonian    @xmath60    where the spin and charge part are still completely decoupled , will serve as a starting point for the perturbation theory we propose . in order to correctly reproduce matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ tjj ] ) ,",
    "couplings between the spin sector and the charge sector must be introduced :    @xmath61    here , @xmath62 is a correction which couples spin and charge by adjusting nearest neighbor bonds and removing next - nearest neighbor bonds in the squeezed spin space in the vicinity of a hole .",
    "certain corrections of the latter sort are redundant whenever two holes are next - nearest neighbors in real space  or nearest neighbors in the present formalism  and this is corrected by @xmath63 .",
    "formally , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are suppressed by powers of both @xmath4 _ and _ @xmath3 , and hence can be regarded as small compared to @xmath64 .",
    "our strategy is thus to treat the spin - charge coupling terms @xmath65 as a perturbation .",
    "we must caution , however , that the hole kinetic energy @xmath66 is very small , or order @xmath67 , and the small energy denominators that appear in perturbation theory must be treated with care .",
    "we apply this method to the spin gapped regime @xmath29 and find it to be a valid procedure in second order perturbation theory , in the sense that corrections are indeed small in the limit we consider .",
    "the general systematics of this at higher order perturbation theory are elucidated in appendix [ convapp ] .",
    "+ in the following section we will show that our approach gives rise to a perturbative expansion of the ground - state energy which may be used to analyze the phase diagram of ( [ tjj ] ) in the vicinity of the origin , where the fate of the various phases is uncertain from numerics for @xmath29 ( fig.[phas]c ) .",
    "we note that the procedure proposed here bears some resemblance to that used by xiang et al . to study the @xmath0-@xmath1-model in a first order perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "in gapless one - dimensional systems it is generally possible to derive basic features of the phase diagram from spectral properties by means of luttinger liquid theory @xcite .",
    "the low - energy properties of a luttinger liquid are completely defined in terms of three parameters which have the dimension of a velocity : a sound velocity @xmath68 , a `` compressibility '' parameter @xmath69 related to elementary charge excitations , and a `` stiffness '' parameter @xmath70 related to elementary current excitations .",
    "these are not independent , but are related by the following universal relations identified by haldane @xcite : @xmath71    the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be calculated from the dependence of the ground - state energy @xmath72 on the carrier density @xmath3 and on a phase twist @xmath73 respectively @xcite , where @xmath73 is associated with a flux @xmath74 penetrating the system when it is imposed on a ring with periodic boundary conditions :    @xmath75    by ( [ vn ] ) , ( [ vj ] ) , @xmath69 is proportional to the inverse compressibility of the system , while @xmath70 is proportional to the kohn stiffness@xcite , which is related to the drude weight of the conductivity .",
    "( [ velos])-([vj ] ) allow the determination of @xmath22 via    @xmath76    from the ground - state energy of the system alone .",
    "the strategy in now to evaluate both the numerator and the denominator in ( [ krho ] ) perturbatively .",
    "+ we now proceed by imposing periodic boundary conditions on the charge sector and the spin sector of the system ( [ h])-([hsc ] ) separately .",
    "this is apparently not the same as imposing periodic boundary conditions in real space , since momenta are now quantized in units of @xmath77 rather than @xmath78 .",
    "note that there is a unique and well defined map between the state space introduced in ( [ states ] ) and the hilbert space of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model only for a finite system with _",
    "open _ boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , imposing open boundary in real space _ is _ equivalent to imposing them in the spin sector and the charge sector separately .",
    "however , going from open to periodic boundary conditions is not expected to matter for large system sizes .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath64 then has two separately conserved momenta , and we denote its ground state by    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the ground state of the spin hamiltonian @xmath81 on a ring of @xmath41 spin sites .",
    "although for @xmath29 the ground state of @xmath81 has a broken translational symmetry and is doubly degenerate , we will assume that @xmath80 is a symmetric superposition of the two symmetry broken ground states and thus has zero lattice momentum .",
    "likewise @xmath82 is a non - interacting fermi sea of @xmath83 spinless fermions hopping on @xmath41 sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the unperturbed ground - state energy we write as    @xmath84    and @xmath85 , @xmath86 are the ground - state energy of @xmath81 and the spinless fermion kinetic energy , respectively .",
    "we will focus our analysis on the limit @xmath19 where @xmath4 is small but fixed . in this limit",
    "we argue that the ground - state energy of ( [ h ] ) has an asymptotic expansion of the form    @xmath87    the coefficients @xmath88 will depend on @xmath4 . at the leading order",
    ", they can in principle be inferred from the spinless fermion kinetic energy in ( [ e00 ] ) .",
    "formally , however it will be more convenient to work with an expansion of the form    @xmath89    the coefficients in ( [ ex ] ) and ( [ ekf ] ) will in general not be the same , due to the non - linear dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath3 in ( [ kf ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath91 , the @xmath92 term in ( [ ekf ] ) is linear in @xmath3 , and hence    @xmath93    we will now proceed by evaluating the above series order by order in perturbation theory , treating the spin - charge coupling terms @xmath94 perturbatively as we have outlined above .",
    "we write    @xmath95    and similarly for all other coefficients , where the label @xmath96 denotes a term arising at @xmath96th order perturbation theory .",
    "we have :    @xmath97    from ( [ vn])-([krho ] ) , ( [ ex ] ) it follows that at small @xmath4    @xmath98    where @xmath99 denotes the second derivative with respect to the phase @xmath73 introduced above , and @xmath100 was used .",
    "( [ kpert ] ) shows that if @xmath101 acquires a finite negative value due to the spin - charge couplings , @xmath22 will diverge as @xmath19 even at small @xmath4 .",
    "this would imply strong superconducting fluctuations and phase separation at the divergence .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath101 is zero or positive , the liquid phase will be stable for small @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and dominant superconducting correlations will be absent in the vicinity of the origin of the phase diagram . in this case , one would expect that @xmath102 to all orders in perturbation theory , since for @xmath103 one would have @xmath104 as @xmath19 which seems inconsistent with the numerical phase diagram . also , @xmath105 is a somewhat unlikely pathological limit of luttinger liquid theory , where the coefficient of the conjugate momentum of the charge field vanishes and the charges freeze into a classical state .",
    "this again seems unlikely in the absence of long - rage interactions , which one may assume especially in the presence of a spin gap . as we have argued initially",
    ", one would rather expect the charges to behave as non - interacting spinless solitons in the dilute limit , and luttinger liquid physics then implies that @xmath22 assumes the value @xmath106 in this limit , provided that no instability intervenes .",
    "this then requires that the coefficient @xmath99 and @xmath107 in ( [ kpert ] ) are not independent , but have a constant ratio independent of @xmath1 .",
    "+ hence , we distinguish only two cases which we feel are the only ones consistent with the numerical phase diagram for @xmath29 , luttinger liquid theory and general expectations from the study of integrable models@xcite : 1 .",
    "@xmath108 , leading to a phase separation instability in the dilute hole limit for any value of @xmath4 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath110 for any @xmath1 , corresponding to a stable liquid as @xmath19 and small @xmath4 , where the charges act as a dilute gas of non - interacting spinless solitons .",
    "we will now show that the second case applies .",
    "+ at first order perturbation theory the energy corrections factorize into mean - field like products , since spin and charge are not correlated in the ground state wave function ( [ gs ] ) .",
    "we have    @xmath111    where @xmath112 denotes the expectation value with respect to @xmath113 or @xmath114 when no ambiguity is possible .",
    "note that the contribution of @xmath63 is of order @xmath115 .",
    "the smallness of this term as @xmath19 reflects the fact that the holes obey the pauli principle which suppresses the probability of two holes being near each other .",
    "we see that already at this order , @xmath63 does not renormalize any of the coefficients in ( [ ex ] ) that we are interested in",
    ". we will thus drop it from the subsequent discussion . to determine leading corrections",
    "to @xmath101 and @xmath107 , we will need to go to second order :    @xmath116    where the sum goes over a complete set of unperturbed eigenstates and the prime excludes the ground state ( [ gs ] ) from the sum .",
    "we now rewrite @xmath62 as    @xmath117    where fourier transforms    @xmath118    have been introduced .",
    "using the fact that the intermediate states in ( [ e2 ] ) can be chosen to be momentum eigenstates , we have    @xmath119    it is necessary to distinguish between terms with zero momentum exchange between spin and charge and those with @xmath120 .",
    "we write :    @xmath121    where @xmath122 contains all @xmath123 terms and @xmath124 contains all the rest . at @xmath123 ,",
    "@xmath125 commutes with the hamiltonian , hence there can be no virtual charge excitation and the charge matrix element is diagonal , @xmath126 :    @xmath127    note that virtual states without spin excitations do not enter ( [ e2_2 ] ) , since @xmath128 would imply @xmath123 and again the charge part vanishes unless also @xmath126 , which is excluded from the sum .",
    "thus for @xmath29 the energy denominator in ( [ e2_2 ] ) is bounded from below by the spin gap @xmath129 which will dominate over charge excitation energies of order @xmath67 very close to the fermi surface .",
    "this assures that the perturbative expansion is well behaved in the limit @xmath19 ( see appendix [ convapp ] ) . + for @xmath120 we note that @xmath130 excites only single particle - hole excitations .",
    "we can thus convert the sum over these terms into a double integral over a hole momentum @xmath131 and a particle momentum @xmath132 :    @xmath133    and @xmath134 is the free fermion dispersion . for later convenience",
    ", we also introduce the function    @xmath135    where the symmetry of @xmath136 was used .    the leading correction to the energy at second order perturbation theory",
    "is a contribution to the @xmath137 coefficient in ( [ ex ] ) :    @xmath138    to leading order in @xmath4 the integral over momenta may be carried out to give a quantity defined in terms of the pure spin chain @xmath81 .",
    "this will demonstrate that the present expansion is well behaved , but we defer the evaluation to the following section in order to continue with the analysis of the crucial @xmath101 coefficient .",
    "its correction at this order reads : @xmath139 again , the contribution from @xmath124 is evaluated by straightforward differentiation of ( [ e ] ) . only boundary terms",
    "survive , as all derivatives of the integrand vanish by symmetry when the limit @xmath140 is taken , using the @xmath141-periodicity of @xmath142 in the second argument .",
    "we find : @xmath143 at this point we have introduced an infinitesimal @xmath144 since terms with zero momentum transfer are really excluded in the sum defining @xmath124 .",
    "however , we argue that the function @xmath145 will be continuous at @xmath123 and hence @xmath146 vanishes .",
    "we note that this is the effect of a non - trivial cancellation between @xmath123 processes and processes with @xmath147 .",
    "physically , the continuity of @xmath145 can be seen by interpreting @xmath145 as the second order energy response of a pure spin chain due to a periodic perturbation , as we explain in detail in appendix [ fcontin ] .",
    "hence , by ( [ b2_2 ] )    @xmath148    we have convinced ourselves that a similar cancellation in the @xmath101 coefficient takes place at third order perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "we therefore propose that    @xmath149    to all orders in perturbation theory , and thus for small @xmath4 the liquid remains stable in the limit @xmath150 even in the case @xmath151 ( fig . [ phas]c ) .",
    "the physical implication of ( [ b=0 ] ) is that indeed the holes act as spinless fermions whose interaction is short ranged , and is irrelevant in the dilute limit .",
    "the pauli principle severely suppresses the wave function when two holes approach each other .",
    "the range of this suppression is larger in one dimension than for dimensions greater than one , since in higher dimensions a curvature of the wave function is less costly at small distances .",
    "therefore , in one dimension this effect is strong enough in order to prevent a short range interaction from generating a term of order @xmath152 in the energy .",
    "+ as we have argued above , the non - interacting nature of the charge degrees of freedom in combination with luttinger liquid arguments also imposes constraints on the linear and cubic terms in @xmath3 when a magnetic flux is imposed .",
    "we now move on to verify these relations perturbatively .",
    "note that @xmath102 leads to @xmath153 in ( [ ex ] ) and ( [ ekf ] ) , such that    @xmath154    in this case boundary terms such as those displayed in ( [ b2_2 ] ) do not contribute , since they vanish by symmetry as @xmath155 when another derivative is acting on them .",
    "instead , we have now again a `` bulk '' contribution analogous to that in ( [ a2 ] ) :    @xmath156    as explained above , this is to be compared to the coefficient @xmath157 .",
    "the phase twist @xmath73 will modify all hopping matrix elements via @xmath158 in ( [ hc ] ) and leads to the following replacement of the free hole dispersion in the function @xmath159 in ( [ f ] ) :    @xmath160    hence from ( [ a2 ] )    @xmath161    however , using the fact that    @xmath162    holds , it follows by shifting the integration variable and comparison with ( [ c2_2 ] ) that    @xmath163    is satisfied .",
    "again , we have confirmed an identical relation at third order perturbation theory@xcite , and this suggests that indeed @xmath164 to all orders .",
    "hence , although the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 in ( [ krho ] ) each receive nontrivial corrections , their ratio is fixed to leading order in @xmath3 such that @xmath22 always approaches @xmath106 in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "luttinger liquid theory then implies that the dilute holes share all the universal properties of a gas of non - interacting spinless particles .",
    "presumably , this picture will hold in the entire regime @xmath39 , where for @xmath38 small doping will give rise to phase separation .",
    "in the preceding section we have shown that our perturbative approach is consistent in all details with a picture where the charge degrees of freedom behave as non - interacting spinless solitons in the dilute limit , and are effectively decoupled from the spin dynamics .",
    "the second order expressions we derived involve complicated sums over both spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
