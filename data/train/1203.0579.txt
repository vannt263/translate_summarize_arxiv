    "<S> density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure of ce- and pu - based heavy fermion superconductors in the so - called 115 family are performed . </S>",
    "<S> the gap equation is used to consider which superconducting order parameters are most favorable assuming a pairing interaction that is peaked at ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath1 ) - the wavevector for the antiferromagnetic ordering found in close proximity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the commonly accepted @xmath2 order parameter , there is evidence that an extended s - wave order parameter with nodes is also plausible . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss whether these results are consistent with current observations and possible measurements that could help distinguish between these scenarios .    </S>",
    "<S> cecoin@xmath3 is a heavy fermion superconductor@xcite , which has been shown to lie in close proximity to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it s structure consists of layers of square planar ce atoms , similar in that respect to the cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> soon after the discovery of superconductivity in cecoin@xmath3 many measurements were performed that were consistent with lines of nodes in the superconducting gap , including specific heat , thermal conductivity @xcite , spin - lattice relaxation rate @xcite , and penetration depth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , arpes measurements could reveal the anisotropic gap structure in @xmath4-space , but current equipment has neither the energy resolution nor the temperature range to perform such a study . in its absence probes which are directionally weighted averages over the fermi surface have been used to identify the location of the nodes , including field - angle dependent specific heat and thermal conductivity@xcite , @xmath5@xcite point contact andreev reflection measurements@xcite , and vortex lattice structure </S>",
    "<S> @xcite all of which now argue that nodes lie along the @xmath6 @xmath7 ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath1 ) direction in the tetragonal brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a neutron scattering resonance has been observed at ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath0 ) which can be interpreted as consistent with @xmath2 symmetry@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> taken together the experimental evidence appears fairly compelling that cecoin@xmath3 is a superconductor with a @xmath2 gap structure . </S>",
    "<S> measurements on other members in this family are relatively scarce due to the fact that either pressure is required for superconductivity to occur ( as in cerhin@xmath3 , cein@xmath8 , ce@xmath9rhin@xmath10 , and cept@xmath9in@xmath11@xcite ) or there are radioactive considerations ( for pucoga@xmath3 , purhga@xmath3 , and pucoin@xmath3@xcite ) . however , with the exception of a few measurements @xcite those measurements which have been made on these compounds are identical to the results found for cecoin@xmath3 @xcite .    on the theoretical side </S>",
    "<S> , the bcs theory of superconductivity allows one to calculate the superconducting gap structure at t = 0 k by solving the gap equation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the superconducting gap function , @xmath14 is the electronic dispersion , and @xmath15 is the pairing interaction . to solve this equation the low energy electronic structure ( ie . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface , and effective masses ) and the pairing interaction @xmath15 must be known . </S>",
    "<S> this would appear to be a formidable if not impossible task for such strongly correlated materials such as the cuprates or the heavy fermion materials which we wish to study@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that for strongly correlated materials there are no well controlled approximations for calculating their properties . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does appear from several cases that simple density functional theory ( dft ) calculations provide a reasonable starting point for computing fermi surfaces in good agreement with experiment , even if the mass renormalization can be off by orders of magnitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the computation of the pairing interaction is more problematic . in weak coupling spin fluctuation theory , however , one may approximate @xmath15 by a renormalized spin susceptibility @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the screened coulomb potential @xcite . whether or not this is rigorously true in the strongly correlated materials of interest , such as the cuprates , pnictides , and heavy fermions , </S>",
    "<S> remains a subject of debate , but at least in the case of the cuprates and the iron based superconductors , the observed gap phenomenology can be reasonably described utilizing this assumption @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , from either a strong coupling , weak coupling , or experimental perspective the spin susceptibility of the cuprates is peaked at ( @xmath0,@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> given the lda determined fermi surface with the largest density of states near ( @xmath18,0 ) and ( 0,@xmath18 ) the order parameter which will naturally maximize the superconducting gap is a @xmath2 order parameter . in the fe - based superconductors such as doped lafeaso and bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 the spin susceptibility is peaked at ( @xmath0,0 ) . in this case , the combination of a hole pocket centered at the @xmath6 point , and an electron pocket at the x point ( of the unfolded brillouin zone ) leads to the suggestion of the so - called @xmath19 gap structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , weak coupling approaches can calculate the variations in the spin susceptibility for different dopings and crystal structures . </S>",
    "<S> inputting the renormalized spin susceptibility and electronic structure leads to strong gap variations and often accidental nodes which are consistent with many of the experimental observations@xcite    since most of the experimental evidence for @xmath20-wave symmetry in the 115 materials is indirect , the story of the fe - based superconductors compels us to reconsider the possible superconducting order parameters in the 115 family of superconductors , which are also compensated multiband metals like the fe - based materials . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this work is not to conclusively show which order parameter is correct in the various 115 materials . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we assume a bcs - like formalism for the superconductivity with a repulsive interaction that is peaked in the vicinity of the nearby long range magnetic order and explore whether the @xmath20-wave order parameters are the only likely candidates for superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that alternative scenarios are at least plausible particularly for the pu - based materials . </S>",
    "<S> for completeness it must be stated that it is also not obvious whether a bcs picture such as this is even the correct starting point to understand superconductivity in these materials , or whether other @xmath21 vectors should be considered for the pairing interaction . however , in the absence of a microscopic theory the phenomenology at least is consistent with what is known about cuprate and fe - based superconductors , and if it can be shown to be consistent in the heavy fermion superconductors as well , it provides a methodology by which one can tailor higher @xmath22 s within a family of superconductors without detailed knowledge of the pairing mechanism .    </S>",

    "<S> we included spin orbit interactions on the @xmath23-electrons with a second variational method .    in the ce - based 115 s </S>",
    "<S> the evidence is fairly clear that the spin susceptibility is peaked at ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath1 ) . for cein@xmath8 , cerhin@xmath3 , cecoin@xmath3 , ce@xmath9rhin@xmath10 , and cept@xmath9in@xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that a dome of superconductivity emerges around a quantum critical point associated with the suppression of an antiferromagnetically ordered phase with @xmath24 = ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath25)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect a similar situation to exist for ce@xmath9pdin@xmath10 and ce@xmath9coin@xmath10@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the neutron resonance observed in the superconducting state of cecoin@xmath3 @xcite , is either a result of the gapping of the spin excitations present at @xmath26 = ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath0)@xcite or a consequence of the pairing interaction being peaked at this wavevector@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( 1 ) the order parameter will be chosen so that the maximal number of states within the gap energy of the fermi energy which are separated by the wave vector @xmath26 = ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath1 ) can have an order parameter with opposite sign ( ie . @xmath13 = - @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as in the cuprates , this results in a @xmath2 symmetry when a large dos exists at ( @xmath0,0,@xmath27 ) and equivalent points . </S>",
    "<S> this certainly is a possibility for the 115 s as emphasized in fig . 2 by the vector @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a second possibility is that the fluctuations strongly pair the states on different fermi surface sheets ( e.g. those sheets labeled @xmath32 and @xmath33 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 with vector @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is analogous to the fe - based superconductors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , an @xmath19 type pairing symmetry , belonging to the @xmath34 representation where the order parameter changes sign between different fermi surface sheets , would be favored . </S>",
    "<S> given the complexity of the actual fermi surface , and the need to overcome the strong onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath17 @xcite it is likely that accidental nodes exist if the @xmath19 order parameter was the dominant order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> if the coupling between fermi surface sheets is sufficiently weak then it is also possible to have different symmetry representations on different fermi surface sheets ( ie . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 on @xmath32 and @xmath35 and @xmath2 on @xmath36 ) @xcite .    as an initial investigation to determine whether an @xmath19 or a @xmath2 order parameter is more likely to occur in any particular 115 compound we examine the band structure more closely . </S>",
    "<S> one should consider the states which once renormalized to account for the enhanced sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat are within the spin fluctuation energy of @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> dhva measurements show that the experimentally measured fermi surfaces are in good agreement with those computed using non - interacting dft theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even though the mass renormalization is not correct , the dft computed electronic structure should give a reasonable first guess as to the leading pairing instability . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the @xmath2 order parameter will be dominant when the majority of states are found near ( @xmath0,0,@xmath27 ) and equivalent points , while the @xmath19 order parameter will be favored when the majority of states are found near the ( 0,0,@xmath27 ) and ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath27 ) points . for completeness all representations consistent with the tetragonal symmetry of the lattice should be considered@xcite , but given the crudeness of this analysis for simplicity we only consider the @xmath2 and @xmath19 order parameters as the most likely scenarios .    </S>",

    "<S> there are states near @xmath6 and a large cylindrical fermi surface centered at ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath27 ) which could favor an @xmath19 order parameter , but especially when considering the entire @xmath27 dispersion , there are significantly more states available for superconductivity near ( @xmath0,0,@xmath27 ) and equivalent points which would indeed favor @xmath2 pairing </S>",

    "<S> dhva results indeed indicate that the mass renormalization is nonuniform across momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> however , they show that the small pocket around the @xmath6 point is actually the lightest band @xcite which thus further supports the @xmath2 gap structure over @xmath19 . while theoretical studies of the order parameter in the 115 s generally favor @xmath2 symmetry @xcite , a study of the orbitally degenerate hubbard model with tight binding parameters for the 115s also found alternative representations depending on the coulomb and crystal field parameters @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> indeed near 0.2 ev a doubling of the number of bands is clearly visible ( especially clear near ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath27 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the number of fermi surface sheets remains unchanged and the electronic structure near @xmath37 is qualitatively similar between ce@xmath9coin@xmath10 and cecoin@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of ce@xmath9pdin@xmath10 near @xmath37 is similar to ce@xmath9coin@xmath10 with a small shift of the chemical potential reflecting the extra electron of pd relative to co , although it is clearly not a rigid shift . finally , for cept@xmath9in@xmath11 , the additional ptin@xmath9 bands relative to the 115 structure does result in additional fermi surface sheets , although quite similar in structure to the other large fermi surface sheets@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the details vary , the main features observed in the band structure of cecoin@xmath3 persist in these three other compounds as well . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the dominant weight is found close to the ( @xmath0,0,@xmath27 ) points suggesting dominantly @xmath2 gap symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetism and superconductivity present in the 115 s appears robust to these minor changes in the electronic structure .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show the analogous band structures for the pu - based superconductors , again in agreement with previous publications @xcite . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the fermi surface of pucoin@xmath3 is qualitatively similar to cecoin@xmath3 , with respect to cylindrical - like fermi surface sheets centered at ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath1 ) , a small hole pocket near @xmath6 and a large fermi surface sheet . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can also tell that in pucoin@xmath3 , the hole pocket is larger , the cylindrical sheets are closer to ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath1 ) , and there is less weight near ( @xmath0,0,@xmath1 ) and equivalent points . </S>",
    "<S> note , that in the case of the pu - based superconductors it is much less clear where to guess the pairing fluctuations might be peaked since the analogous long range order has yet to be found . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the purpose of this discussion we will again assume that the pairing fluctuations are peaked at ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed what one would assume on the basis of a uniform @xmath17 spin fluctuation calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of the ce - based superconductors the arguments for @xmath2 symmetry are much less conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> relative to the ce - based materials there are fewer states in the vicinity of ( @xmath0,0,@xmath27 ) and more states near the fermi level at ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to speculate that the potential for an @xmath19 order parameter is greater in the case of pu - based 115 s than in the case of ce - based 115 s . </S>",
    "<S> note also that in contrast to the ce - based compounds , the bare @xmath23 level is situated directly at the fermi level in these pu compounds . as a consequence , the bilayer variants such as pu@xmath9coga@xmath10 have dramatically different electronic structure relative to pucoga@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a possible reason for why superconductivity is much less prevalent in the relatives of the pu - based 115s @xcite , while it is much more robust in the ce - based 115 s .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) band structure from top to bottom of pucoga@xmath3 , pucoin@xmath3 and pu@xmath9coga@xmath10 ( which is not superconducting ) . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the points reflects the amount of @xmath23-character . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) zoom of panel ( a ) , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] ( color online ) ( a ) band structure from top to bottom of pucoga@xmath3 , pucoin@xmath3 and pu@xmath9coga@xmath10 ( which is not superconducting ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) zoom of panel ( a ) , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we now briefly reconsider the experimental evidence for the position of the nodes in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , field angle specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements can give the position of the nodes . </S>",
    "<S> however , they rely on the ability to accurately model the true electronic structure , which as we have emphasized , is poorly understood in heavy fermion materials . furthermore , a similar 4-fold modulation has also been reported in some of the fe - based superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , while the point contact andreev spectroscopy data could differentiate in favor of a @xmath2 order parameter relative to a @xmath38 order parameter , more work is needed for a realistic electronic structure whether alternative gap structures including @xmath19 with accidental nodes are possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also find it interesting that the universal limit of the residual term in the thermal conductivity @xcite is not obeyed with la - doping in cecoin@xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this likely reflects the multiband nature of superconductivity in these materials @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> what experiments could help resolve the question of the order parameter in these systems ? based on similar work which is being proposed to differentiate various gap symmetries in the fe - based superconductors it is easy to propose similar measurements for the ce- and pu - based 115 superconductors , even though we acknowledge that temperature , pressure , and radioactive constraints may make many of these measurements very difficult . certainly , phase sensitive experiments as done on cuprates @xcite would clearly be the most definitive tests of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> additional studies such as examining details of impurity states with scannning tunneling microscopy@xcite and the quasiparticle interference pattern@xcite , the neutron resonance @xcite , and andreev bound states @xcite are a few examples of probes that will further help distinguish between different possible order parameters . in the exceptional case of the 20 k pucoga@xmath3 superconductor , </S>",
    "<S> arpes measurements are obviously also potentially enlightening . </S>",
    "<S> note , that one should also consider the possibility that the order parameter may change ( and could gain / lose nodes ) as a function of tuning parameters such as pressure or doping @xcite , as has been suggested in the fe - based superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> we have examined the band structures for various ce- and pu - based superconductors within the 115 family . </S>",
    "<S> based on the assumption of pairing fluctuations which are peaked at @xmath39 = @xmath40 = @xmath0 we find that the @xmath2 order parameter is the likely candidate for superconductivity in the ce - based materials . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find that the @xmath19 order parameter may be favored if an anisotropic mass renormalization favors the gapping between states in the vicinity of ( 0,0,@xmath1 ) and ( @xmath0,@xmath0,@xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally this does not appear to be the case in cecoin@xmath3 , but it is a much stronger possibility for the pu - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this survey is to stimulate further discussion of the order parameter in the 115 based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> future theoretical and experimental work is needed to clarify the order parameter in these materials . </S>"
