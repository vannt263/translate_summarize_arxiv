    "the chemical compositions of stars and gas , as is widely known , provide important clues to understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "in particular the abundance ratio of @xmath1-elements such as oxygen to iron is a useful probe of the formation history of galaxies .",
    "the main sources of metals are considered to be supernovae ( sne ) , especially type ii sne ( sne ii ) and type ia sne ( sne ia ) .",
    "they have different abundance patterns , the former produces @xmath1-elements as well as iron and the latter produces hardly any @xmath1-elements .",
    "therefore , the measurement of [ @xmath1/fe ] is closely related to the ratio of sne ii to sne ia . while the progenitors of sne ii are massive stars larger than @xmath2 , those of sne ia are considered to be white dwarfs in binary systems",
    ". therefore the explosion rate of sne ii is almost proportional to the star formation rate of their progenitor stars at that time , but there is a time lag between sne ia explosions and the formation of their progenitor stars . since the evolution timescales of those elements are independent and different , we can obtain useful information on galaxy formation and star formation histories from the abundance ratio of those elements .",
    "because sne ii explode almost instantaneously , the chemical evolution process has usually been formulated by assuming that massive stars immediately explode right after their formation ( the instantaneous recycling [ ir ] approximation)@xcite . in those works , galaxies are usually assumed to grow up in monolithic clouds , in which timescales of gas infall and star formation ( sf ) are typically treated as free parameters . since it is possible to observe and resolve individual stars in the solar - neighborhood ,",
    "many studies have focused on evolution of the galactic disk . by adjusting those parameters and by incorporating stellar population synthesis techniques @xcite , detailed galaxy evolution models that reproduce observations",
    "have been developed @xcite .    in the framework of such traditional galaxy evolution models , several authors explicitly considered chemical enrichment due to sne ia @xcite .",
    "they included delayed production of metals due to sne ia in the galaxy evolution models . by comparing their models with solar neighborhood stars in the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) and",
    "abundance ratio such as [ o / fe ] against metallicity , @xcite and @xcite inferred a typical lifetime of sne ia of 1.3@xmath31.5 gyr .",
    "although @xcite has claimed that sne ia start to explode at the age of about 0.6 gyr , @xcite recently derived that the lifetime should be longer than about 1 gyr at the 99 per cent confidence level by comparing the cosmic star formation history with the cosmic sne ia rate .",
    "considered from the viewpoint of cosmological structure formation , however , these models are still only phenomenological .",
    "recent theoretical and observational studies of structure formation have revealed that the universe is dominated in mass by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and that baryonic objects such as galaxies form in virialized objects of dark matter called dark halos . in the cdm model ,",
    "since smaller - scale density fluctuations in the early universe have larger fluctuation amplitudes , larger halos form through mergers of smaller dark halos ( the hierarchical clustering scenario ) .",
    "this suggests that large galactic gas clouds would have formed at low redshift by mergers of subgalactic clumps which have formed at higher redshift .",
    "therefore we may have to modify our picture of chemical evolution in galaxies as well as that of galaxies themselves .",
    "recently , based on a semi - analytic ( sa ) approach , galaxy formation models in the hierarchical clustering scenario have been developed , in which the formation histories of individual dark halos are followed by using a monte carlo method and physical processes such as gas cooling and star formation are taken into account in the histories of dark halos .",
    "this is a natural consequence of adopting the cdm model because we are not able to freely assume formation histories of dark halos as far as we would like to construct galaxy formation models consistent with the cdm model .",
    "many authors have found that such sa models reproduce well various characteristics of galaxies at the present and at high redshift such as luminosity functions , gas fractions , size distributions , and faint galaxy number counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in recent sa models ,",
    "chemical enrichment is considered , but generally only with the ir approximation .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated color - magnitude and metallicity - magnitude relations of cluster elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is extended to dwarf spheroidals , @xmath4 , by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite consider chemical evolution in spiral galaxies , a part of which should be identified as damped ly-@xmath1 systems .",
    "some of them found good agreement with observations .",
    "pioneering work taking into account chemical enrichment due to sne ia in a sa model was carried out by @xcite and @xcite . in those papers",
    ", they picked out averaged and individual formation histories of dark halos , and then , assuming the closed - box chemical evolution , they followed star formation and chemical enrichment histories . thus , while they took into account merging histories of galaxies , the outflow of gas caused by sne or the supernova ( sn ) feedback that has been realized to be an primarily important process in galaxy formation , was not considered . as shown by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "sn feedback significantly affects chemical enrichment , at least due to sne ii .",
    "this suggests that the closed - box model has limitations in analyzing chemical evolution in a realistic situation .    as a complementary approach to sa modeling ,",
    "chemo - dynamical simulations including sne ia have been developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "although this approach has an advantage in resolving spatial structure , because of the limitation of numerical resolution and numerical techniques themselves , further improvements are still required @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sa model is free from numerical effects and limitations .",
    "this is a great advantage for understanding global properties of galaxy formation because in principle the sa model can investigate from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters simultaneously .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a fully self - consistent treatment of chemical enrichment with a sa model .",
    "the basic model is the mitaka model presented by @xcite , which includes a monte carlo realization of the merging histories of dark halos , radiative gas cooling , quiescent star formation and starbursts , mergers of galaxies , chemical enrichment assuming the ir approximation , size estimation of galaxies taking into account the dynamical response to gas removal during starbursts and stellar population synthesis . as a first attempt",
    ", we assume that all sne ia have the same lifetime .",
    "this is , of course , a rather simplified model . in reality",
    "the lifetimes of sne ia are considered to have a broad distribution , and there is even a claim that low - metallicity environments inhibit sne ia @xcite . our model , however , has an essential characteristic of sne ia , that is , the time lag between star formation and the explosion .",
    "it enables us to see how such a delayed explosion of sne ia affects the chemical enrichment and abundance pattern in galaxies . using this model , we focus on the chemical enrichment in milky way ( mw)-like galaxies .",
    "this has a particularly meaning because there are many non - trivial effects on the chemical enrichment in the hierarchical formation of galaxies .",
    "massive galaxies such as the mw form not only via gas cooling but via mergers of pre - galactic sub - clumps with stronger efficiencies of the sn feedback than those in massive galaxies residing in deeper gravitational potential wells .",
    "thus , the main purpose of this paper is to compare the sa model with a monolithic collapse model of @xcite .",
    "this will enable us to see how the hierarchical formation process affects galactic metal enrichment due to sne ia based on the cdm model .",
    "further comparison to other objects will be done in subsequent papers .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our sa model . in ",
    "3 we provide a detailed prescription of the chemical enrichment due to sne ia . in ",
    "4 we show the luminosity function of galaxies that should be compared with that in the local group , and properties of mw - like galaxies . in  5 we compare our model with observations in the [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane and the [ fe / h ] distribution in a statistical sense . in  6 we briefly discuss individual galaxies . in  7 we investigate parameter dependences of the main results . in  8 we provide a summary and conclusions .",
    "here we briefly describe how to form galaxies in our model , which is based on the mitaka model @xcite . in a cdm universe , dark matter halos cluster gravitationally and grow in mass through their mergers , depending on the adopted power spectrum of the initial density fluctuations . in each of the merged dark halos , radiative gas cooling , star formation , and gas reheating by supernovae occur .",
    "the cooled dense gas and stars constitute _ galaxies_. these galaxies sometimes merge together in a common dark halo , and then more massive galaxies form . during these processes , chemical enrichment due to sne ii",
    "is solved by assuming the ir approximation , and the enrichment due to sne ia by using the past star formation histories of individual galaxies ( see the next section ) . repeating these processes , galaxies form and evolve to the present epoch .",
    "the mitaka model reproduces many observations such as luminosity functions , cold gas fraction , sizes of disks and spheroidals , surface brightnesses , the faber - jackson relation , mass - to - light ratio and faint galaxy number counts .",
    "the details , apart from chemical enrichment due to sne ia are found in @xcite .    throughout this paper , we consider only a @xmath5-dominated cdm ( @xmath5cdm ) cosmology with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and a power spectrum given by @xcite , which takes into account the effects of baryon .",
    "the merging histories of dark halos are calculated by using a method given by @xcite .",
    "the timestep is @xmath8 , which corresponds to the dynamical timescale of dark halos collapsing at @xmath9 .",
    "only dark halos with circular velocity larger than @xmath10 km  s@xmath11 are regarded as isolated halos .",
    "while the value of @xmath12 hardly affects the chemical evolution in mw - like galaxies that we consider in this paper , we will compare the luminosity function of galaxies in the local group ( lg ) with the model luminosity functions with various @xmath13 in section [ sec : setting ] .",
    "the circular velocities of _ root _ halos , which are halos at @xmath14 , is set to be @xmath15 km  s@xmath11 , which is nearly equal to the rotation speed of the mw .    the cycle among baryonic components in dark halos is computed as follows .",
    "diffuse baryonic gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature estimated from the depth of the gravitational potential well of its host dark halo when it collapses .",
    "this is called hot gas , whose mass is @xmath16 .",
    "the hot gas dissipates its energy and cools by radiation only for halos with @xmath17 km  s@xmath11 , to avoid formation of unphysically giant galaxies , in each timestep .",
    "the cooling rate is estimated by using the metallicity - dependent cooling functions given by @xcite .",
    "this cooled gas concentrates in the vicinity of the center of the dark halo and constitutes a galactic disk .",
    "the mass of cold gas is @xmath18 .",
    "disk stars form by consuming the cold gas with a star formation timescale @xmath19 . in proportion to the star formation rate @xmath20 , massive stars explode as sne ii .",
    "the energy released by sne ii reheats the cold gas and a part of the cold gas is absorbed into the hot gas ( sn feedback ) .",
    "the reheating rate is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are free parameters .",
    "in this paper the star formation timescale is assumed to be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a free parameter , which is called the constant star formation model ( csf ) in @xcite . because @xmath27 is much larger than unity in low mass halos owing to their shallower gravitational potential wells ,",
    "most of cold gas is reheated and only a small fraction of it turns into stars .",
    "the above processes are computed during each timestep .    when a dark halo collapses by merging two or more dark halos , the hot gas components in the progenitor halos are immediately merged and constitute a hot gas component in the new dark halo .",
    "in contrast , galaxies do not merge together immediately .",
    "at first we define a central galaxy in the newly collapsing dark halo as the central galaxy in the most massive progenitor halo , and the rest of the galaxies are regarded as satellite galaxies .",
    "two modes of galaxy mergers are considered .",
    "one is a merger between a central and satellite galaxies , in which a satellite falls into a central galaxy after losing its energy by dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "another is that between satellite galaxies by random collisions @xcite .",
    "we estimate the timescales of the dynamical friction and the random collisions for all satellites .",
    "satellites with sufficiently short merger timescales compared with the timescale of subsequent collapse of the dark halo merge with a central or other satellite galaxies .",
    "if the mass ratio of stars and cold gas of a smaller galaxy to a larger one , @xmath28 , is larger than @xmath29 , a starburst occurs with sn feedback and all stars go into the bulge component .",
    "then no cold gas remains .",
    "otherwise the smaller satellite is simply absorbed into the disk component of the central or larger satellite without any activities of star formation .",
    "we adopt @xmath30 .    in each timestep",
    ", the disk size is estimated as a rotationally supported disk under the assumption of specific angular momentum conservation for cooling hot gas .",
    "initially , hot gas is assumed to have the same specific angular momentum as that of its host dark halo .",
    "the angular momentum of dark halos has a log - normal distribution in terms of the so - called dimensionless spin parameter .",
    "if the estimated disk size is larger than before , we renew the size . at the same time",
    ", we also set the disk rotation velocity to be the same as @xmath31 of the dark halo .",
    "when a major merger occurs , the bulge size is estimated by assuming energy conservation",
    ". then a starburst occurs . because the mass of the galaxy after the starburst is different from that before , we consider the dynamical response to the mass loss of the size and velocity dispersion . to do this",
    ", we use the formalism of the dynamical response taking into account the underlying dark matter potential developed by @xcite .",
    "this process is required to reproduce observed characteristics of dwarf spheroidals such as surface brightness and velocity dispersion .    through the above processes , we obtain star formation histories of individual galaxies . from those we estimate the luminosities of galaxies using a stellar population synthesis technique .",
    "we adopt the simple stellar populations given by @xcite .",
    "these procedures are the same as those in @xcite .",
    "readers who are interested in the details will find them in that paper .",
    "the key parameters of the model are tabulated in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "cccccc 150 km  s@xmath11 & 4 & 1.3 gyr & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 +",
    "the chemical enrichment is treated in a similar manner to @xcite , in which they considered chemical enrichment of oxygen ( o ) and iron ( fe ) due to both sne ii and sne ia using the infall model in the framework of monolithic collapse @xcite . in their paper , the basic equations describing the gas fraction , @xmath35 , and metallicities for the @xmath36-th elements , @xmath37 , are written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the gas infall rate , @xmath40 is a distribution function of the lifetime of sne ia , @xmath41 , @xmath1 is the locked - up mass fraction in low - mass stars and dead stellar remnants and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the chemical yields of the @xmath36-th element produced by sne ii and sne ia , respectively ( see equations 1 and 2 in their paper ) .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath44 is assumed to obey the schmidt - law @xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a rate coefficient .",
    "the infall term is assumed to be @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the infall timescale , @xmath49 is the incomplete gamma function and @xmath50 is the age of the galaxy . in the followings ,",
    "we compare our results with their @xmath51 model having @xmath51 , @xmath52 gyr , @xmath53 gyr , @xmath54 , and a constant lifetime of sne ia , @xmath55 .",
    "this value of the lifetime of sne ia is consistent with a theoretically estimated value using a model of @xcite , which is based on @xcite , assuming kennicutt s initial mass function ( imf ) of stars @xcite .",
    "we have estimated that the mean lifetime is about 2.4 gyr and the median about 1.8 gyr .    in our model , because of the sn feedback , these equations are modified . during disk star formation or a starburst in a timestep that corresponds to @xmath8 , chemical enrichment due to sne ii",
    "is solved by assuming the ir approximation , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are metallicities for @xmath36-th element of cold and hot gas , respectively .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath44 is given by @xmath59 .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : mcold])-([eqn : zhot ] ) do not have infall terms because we add the mass of hot gas that should cool during a timestep @xmath60 to the mass of cold gas at the beginning of each timestep .",
    "the timestep is sufficiently short to describe smooth gas accretion .",
    "therefore no infall term is required as an approximation .",
    "the mixture of merging histories of dark halos , gas cooling and sn feedback should correspond to the infall process with a long timescale , @xmath61gyr .",
    "the roles of the physical processes are clarified in section 6 .",
    "in addition to this process , metals released from sne ia are put into the cold gas .",
    "the mass of @xmath36-th element released during a timestep [ @xmath62 is @xmath63 in order to estimate this quantity , star formation histories of individual galaxies are stored .",
    "again , we would like to stress that the above procedures of chemical enrichment due to both sne ia and ii are computed in each timestep .",
    "since one of the main purposes of this study is to compare our results with a monolithic cloud model given by @xcite , we adopt the same chemical yields empirically determined by their analysis , which are also tabulated in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "thus we also impose two nucleosynthesis constraints they adopted : @xmath64 const . , and @xmath65 .",
    "returned mass from sne ia is simply treated together with that from massive stars , that is , it is included in a parameter for the instantaneous recycling , @xmath66 . for simplicity we do not take into account the following effects that might affect chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "one is energy feedback due to sne ia , which was investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "second is inhomogeneous star formation in a gas cloud considering propagation of star formation sites , which is another way to extend the simple traditional galaxy evolution model @xcite .",
    "although it will probably provide a broader distribution in metal abundances , we concentrate , in this paper , on how the hierarchical formation process affects the chemical enrichment .",
    "third is the metallicity effect that a low metallicity environment inhibits the explosion of sne ia @xcite , which might affect the estimation of @xmath41 .",
    "these effects would be worth considering in future .",
    "the model we use here is the same as that in @xcite except for the chemical enrichment process , which do not affect any results in that paper .",
    "therefore we do not repeat showing the same figures as shown in that paper .    in the following ,",
    "we pick out galaxies in dark halos of @xmath67 km  s@xmath11 whose central galaxies are identified as spiral galaxies with @xmath68-band bulge - to - total luminosity ratio smaller than 0.4 @xcite and with @xmath69 @xcite and disk rotation velocities",
    "@xmath70 km s@xmath71 @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we call a dark halo satisfying the above criteria a lg - halo .",
    "we realize 100 lg - halos and average over the realization .    before entering the details , we see the characteristics of mw - like galaxies and their satellites . in figure",
    "[ fig : lf]a we show a luminosity function of galaxies in lg - halos .",
    "the solid line indicates the model luminosity function and the histogram the observed one compiled by m. irwin . because the observed data are for the mw and m31 groups , luminosity functions for models are simply doubled to be compared with the observed data .",
    "our model shows a broad agreement with the observed luminosity function in the lg at @xmath72 , although at fainter magnitude too many galaxies are predicted . while the observed luminosity functions actually depend on the definition of the local group , our conclusion about the chemical evolution of the mw - like galaxies does not change as shown below .",
    "the detailed discussion is given by @xcite .",
    "such overabundance of low luminosity galaxies is easily eliminated by taking into account some physical or observational effects as shown by many authors .",
    "one of the important effects is photoionization due to ultraviolet ( uv ) background or reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we show the effect of the jeans mass increasing due to reionization in a simple way by changing @xmath12 .",
    "note that in reality this effect should turn on only after the epoch of reionization .",
    "indeed , this simple model is similar to @xcite , in which they assumed that gas cooling is prohibited in dark halos with @xmath73 km  s@xmath11 at redshifts between 1.5 and 5 to be consistent with the lg luminosity function in the standard cdm model . in figure",
    "[ fig : lf]b , we show luminosity functions with different @xmath13 .",
    "as shown in the panel the solid , dashed , dot - dashed and dotted lines indicate @xmath74 40 ( the reference model ) , 30 , 50 and 70 km  s@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "evidently large @xmath13 inhibits the formation of dwarf galaxies .",
    "another effect is incompleteness in the observations .",
    "@xcite predict that there are many dwarf galaxies with surface brightnesses too low to detect . in the bottom panel ,",
    "figure [ fig : lf]c , we show luminosity functions with different threshold surface brightnesses , @xmath75 , which determines the lowest surface brightness of galaxies to be detected .",
    "the solid , dashed , dot - dashed and dotted lines indicate @xmath76 , 26 , 25 and 24 mag  arcsec@xmath77 , respectively , where surface brightness is defined as that within the effective radius .",
    "although the lowest one is about 26 mag arcsec@xmath77 @xcite , clearly observations are not a surface brightness - complete sample .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the lowest surface brightness of model galaxies reaches about 30 mag arcsec@xmath77 in @xmath68-band at @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , some of these low surface brightness galaxies might be disrupted by tidal interaction with other galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these figures suggest that the so - called satellite - galaxy problem might not be so serious , at least for luminous objects . anyway , changing @xmath13 and @xmath75 hardly affects our results on chemical enrichment of the mw - like galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ fig : other ] , we show the disk rotation velocity , @xmath79 , cold gas fraction , @xmath80 , and effective radius of the disk , @xmath81 , of the mw - like galaxies .",
    "the crosses denote individual mw - like galaxies . since the disk rotation velocity is adjusted to be the circular velocity of the host dark halo only when the mass of disk increases , it is not always the same as @xmath31 , which is chosen to be 220 km  s@xmath11 at @xmath14 .",
    "the rotation velocity obtained is distributed around the value 220 km  s@xmath11 that is similar to the observed rotation velocity of the galactic disk .",
    "the cold gas fraction is about 10 - 15% in mass , and the effective radius is around 7@xmath82kpc .",
    "these are very similar to the observed properties of the mw .",
    "thus our mw - like galaxies are good probes enough to investigate the chemical enrichment in the mw .",
    "in this model we treat bulge and disk stars separately , so hereafter we show results for both separately , keeping in mind there are still large uncertainties in observation of bulge stars . in the followings ,",
    "we compare our results not only with a theoretical infall model given by @xcite but also with stars in our galaxy .",
    "we focus on the difference between the hierarchical and monolithic models , rather than comparisons with observations .",
    "we assume that our galaxy is a representative , typical sample of galaxies of mw - like galaxies under consideration .",
    "future observations will make clear whether this assumption is valid or not .",
    "firstly , in this section , we show mean properties of mw - like galaxies .",
    "properties of individual galaxies are discussed in  [ sec : ind ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fid]a we show the distribution of disk stars in the [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane by contours . by tracking star formation histories and metallicity evolutions ,",
    "we obtain distributions of stars in the plane for individual galaxies .",
    "the figure shows the average of 100 mw - like galaxies .",
    "the levels of contours drawn by the thin solid and dashed lines indicate 0.5 , 0.4 , 0.3 , 0.2 and 0.1 , and 0.02 and 0.005 times the largest number of stars in grids , respectively .",
    "the solid lines indicate the @xmath51 model given by @xcite ( see tables 1 and 2 in their paper for details ) .",
    "the crosses and filled triangles are observed data for solar - neighborhood stars given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . as is clearly shown in this panel ,",
    "our model reproduce well the observations of disk stars including their dispersion . the apparent discrepancy at [ fe / h]@xmath83 is caused by the first nucleosynthesis constraint , @xmath64 const . for all sne",
    "ii ( see section [ sec : chem ] ) . at the break",
    "point the model prediction gives slightly higher [ o / fe ] than observations .",
    "probably if the assumption of a constant @xmath41 were relaxed , the abundance ratio at there would decrease as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the dispersion for the model comes from dispersion in a single galaxy and that for different samples . in the next section",
    "we show the former effect by seeing some individual galaxies .    it should be noted that a small radial abundance gradients of metals in the galactic disk are suggested by observations , @xmath84 dex kpc@xmath11 for iron and @xmath85 dex kpc@xmath11 for oxygen @xcite .",
    "this might cause a systematic difference in the metallicity distribution when averaged over the whole disk . in that case",
    ", we will need to change the values of chemical yields , which are empirically determined by @xcite to produce an agreement with the observations for solar - neighborhood stars .",
    "bulge stars are also distributed like disk stars in the [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane but the range is slightly different as shown in figure [ fig : fid]b . in particular , although the fraction is low , there are many oxygen - enhanced stars at [ fe / h]@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that [ o / fe ] for bulge stars , shown by filled inverse triangles , has a broadly similar trend with [ fe / h ] to disk stars , but some of them show oxygen - enhancement , [ o / fe]@xmath86 even at [ fe / h]@xmath0 .",
    "recent high - resolution spectroscopic observations of bulge stars by @xcite reveal a similar trend of [ mn / fe ] to that for disk stars . while they observed less than 10 stars",
    ", their observations may support our model .",
    "clearly more samples will provide important constraints on bulge formation .",
    "using monolithic collapse models , @xcite predicted more oxygen - enhanced bulge stars . to obtain this",
    ", they assumed higher star formation rates and shorter infall timescales for bulge stars than those for disk stars . in our model ,",
    "some bulge stars are also formed with a very short timescale , that is , starbursts .",
    "the difference we predict between disk and bulge stars , however , is smaller presumably because not all bulge stars are formed by starbursts and some have been formed in progenitor galaxies .",
    "another possibility to form oxygen - enhanced stars is a variation of the imf .",
    "recently the imf for starbursts is suggested to be top - heavy compared to the imf for the disk star formation @xcite , which means that much more sne ii must explode than expected for salpeter - like imfs .",
    "because @xmath1-elements from sne ii are likely to be produced more , metal - rich bulge stars will tend to be placed at [ o / fe]@xmath87 .    in figures [ fig : fid]c and d ,",
    "we show the iron mdf for disk and bulge stars , respectively .",
    "the solid lines denote the model prediction .",
    "the filled squares and crosses in the panel ( c ) and the filled squares , crosses and pluses in the panel ( d ) indicate observed [ fe / h ] distributions given by @xcite and @xcite for disk stars and @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for bulge stars , respectively .",
    "all of these distributions are normalized for the integrate over the whole range to be unity .",
    "the distribution for disk stars shows an excellent agreement with the observed distributions .",

    "the model prediction for bulge stars also agrees well with the observed data . in another approach",
    ", a recent chemo - dynamical simulation of the galactic bulge by @xcite also predicts distribution of stars in [ o / fe]-[fe / h ] plane and in number against [ fe / h ] . in their results , there are more oxygen - enhanced stars than in the observation by @xcite and our prediction . at the same time , their derived [ fe / h ] distribution is similar to ours , although the number of high [ fe / h ] stars is a little larger .",
    "thus , although more data will be required to constrain the model of bulge formation , we can say that both our sa model and the recent numerical simulation broadly agree with the current observations .",
    "figure [ fig : sfr1 ] shows averaged star formation histories of mw - like galaxies indicated by the solid line . the infall model given by @xcite",
    "is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "note that the sfr for the infall model is plotted beyond the cosmic age given by the cosmological parameters we adopt , @xmath90 gyr , because their model is normalized at 15gyr .",
    "the star formation rates are normalized by stellar masses at 13gyr .",
    "sfrs plotted are those averaged over each timestep ( @xmath91 ) and over all realization .",
    "clearly galaxies in our sa model have similar star formation histories to the monolithic collapse model s .",
    "hence the slow star formation in the infall model , which is brought by long infall and star formation timescales chosen by obtaining an agreement with observations , is naturally explained by the mixture of physical processes including merging histories of dark halos , gas cooling and sn feedback .",
    "while a history of each mw - like galaxy has a variety around the averaged history , as we will show in the next section , we have found that predicted metallicity distributions of disk stars are quite similar to the averaged one shown in figure [ fig : fid ] . since bulge components are formed by major mergers that are rare events , it should be noted that the results on the bulge stars as just an average .",
    "future observations of bulge stars in other galaxies will provide stronger constraint on galaxy formation models based on the cdm cosmology .",
    "our results suggest that the formation of spiral galaxies is well approximated by the traditional infall model because our model provides similar results to those given by @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the result by @xcite , in which they traced formation histories of individual galaxies and found similar star formation histories of spiral galaxies to the traditional infall model ( see upper panels of figure 3 in their paper ) .",
    "note that recent infall models have become more complicated , including multi - accretion of gas , in order to reproduce observational results .",
    "moreover , to reproduce radial gradients of metallicities , the models require sfrs dependent on the radius of disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "physically , the radial gradients should be solved by computing complex dynamics of disk formation .",
    "this requires numerical simulations of galaxy formation following dynamical evolution including the mixing process of gas and metals",
    ".    finally we shortly discuss relations between averaged metallicities of individual galaxies and their merging histories .",
    "figure [ fig : z_z ] shows mass - weighted mean metallicities of disk stars for o ( _ crosses _ ) and fe ( _ pluses _ ) against their final major merger epochs , @xmath92 .",
    "correlations of metallicities with @xmath92 are very weak for o and negligible for fe .",
    "particularly , the fe - metallicity is almost independent of @xmath92 .",
    "the o - metallicity only for galaxies which experienced a major merger very recently is slightly lower or has a larger scatter than others . to make the reason clear , however , we need more samples of high - z mw - like galaxies .",
    "the current number of high - z samples is still few for quantitative statistical discussion . at this stage",
    ", what we can say is that there is no clear correlation between the metallicity and the final major merger epoch .",
    "figure [ fig : z_zh ] shows the same as the previous figure but for final major merger epochs for their host halos , @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , we do not see correlations between the o - metallicity and @xmath93 .",
    "the negligible or weaker correlation with @xmath94 than with @xmath92 can be reasonable because the galaxy merger does not directly reflect the halo merger and is lead by other physical mechanisms , namely , dynamical friction and random collisions .",
    "thus , we conclude that the metallicity depends only weakly on the formation history of galaxies and their host halos . instead",
    ", we can see much stronger dependence of the metallicity on parameters of , for example , sn feedback later .",
    "in the previous section , we showed mean properties of mw - like galaxies .",
    "we here show results for two samples in order to see properties of individual galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : lf_ind ] shows luminosity functions of galaxies in two lg - halos hosting mw - like galaxies as central galaxies of id-143 with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , and id-200 with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the luminosity function in id-143 halo agrees well with the observed one at @xmath103 , and that in id-200 halo broadly agrees but slightly overproduces galaxies at @xmath104 .",
    "this slight discrepancy between the models and the observations should substantially decrease when taking into account some effects such as the selection effects shown in ",
    "[ sec : setting ] .",
    "we also find that difference between samples is not significant .",
    "figures [ fig : ri143 ] and [ fig : ri200 ] show the same figures as figure [ fig : fid ] , that is , the distribution of disk and bulge stars in [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane and mdfs for [ fe / h ] , but for individual galaxies of id-143 and id-200 , respectively . in order to enhance the contribution of stars with small fractions , the contour levels are not linear but logarithmic .",
    "as easily can be seen , some stars are located in a low [ o / fe ] region at low [ fe / h ] , particularly for id-143 .",
    "such stars can be brought by smaller sub - clumps via minor mergers .",
    "because low - mass galaxies with shallow gravitational potential wells suffer strong sn feedback , the metal enrichment does not proceed significantly .",
    "therefore sne ia start to explode and lower [ o / fe ] when [ fe / h ] is still low .",
    "this effect shall be shown in figure [ fig : snfb1 ] for a stronger sn feedback case .",
    "although the number of such stars is small , it might be discovered as relics of past minor merger histories .",
    "note that , of course , this depends on the details of the process of minor mergers .",
    "in contrast to id-143 , the galaxy id-200 does not have such low-[o / fe ] , low-[fe / h ] disk stars .",
    "this is because minor mergers did not happen after the last major merger and the disk grew in a similar way to the infall model of monolithic collapse .",
    "merging histories of these galaxies should provide insights for understanding the difference in the stellar distribution in [ o / fe]-[fe / h ] plane .",
    "for example , the last merger epoch for this galaxy is @xmath99 , and for id-143 galaxy with many minor mergers @xmath95 , which is earlier than that of id-200 s .",
    "thus it should have been hard for id-200 galaxy to accrete small sub - clumps as minor mergers until present .",
    "similar trails can be seen for bulge stars both of id-143 and id-200 galaxies , in contrast to disk stars . because many stars in bulges formed in disks firstly and then they were transferred to bulges by major mergers , the trails in bulges should reflect minor - merger histories onto disks before formation of bulges , or , last major mergers .",
    "therefore these galaxies could have enough time to accrete sub - clumps until last major mergers .",
    "the widths of mdfs for both mw - like galaxies are slightly narrower than the averaged one shown in figure [ fig : fid ] . in our model",
    "we assume that metals are well mixed in a galaxy . in reality , however , the mixing of metals in a galaxy would not be completed and therefore the mdf would be broadened as observed .",
    "if we take this effect of inhomogeneous metal enrichment into account , the mdf will become wider .",
    "note that recent observations of more than 10,000 solar - neighborhood stars by @xcite have suggested a narrower mdf than past observations .",
    "although we should be careful in sample selection , it may suggest that the metal mixing is efficient for disk stars .",
    "this should be addressed in future .",
    "here we investigate how the stellar metallicity depends on the fundamental model parameters such as the sn feedback and star formation timescale , as well as the lifetime of sne ia , in order to clarify how physical processes such as star formation affect chemical enrichment in galaxies .",
    "note that adopted parameters below break the agreement with observations .",
    "we vary the values of the parameters just to see how each physical process affects metal enrichment .",
    "firstly , we vary the lifetime of sne ia , @xmath41 . in figures [ fig : tia1 ] and [ fig : tia2 ] , we show the same model as in figure [ fig : fid ] but for @xmath105 and 3 gyr , respectively . in the case of the shorter @xmath41 , because enrichment due to sne ia begins earlier , the break point in the [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane moves toward lower [ fe / h ] . on the other hand ,",
    "in the longer @xmath41 case , the iron abundance initially increases only due to sne ii , so the break point moves toward higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "this dependence is basically the same as that shown in analyses using the traditional model .",
    "this also suggests the similarity of formation of spiral galaxies between the hierarchical and traditional models .    in the shorter @xmath41 case ,",
    "an interesting feature in abundance ratio emerges there .",
    "bulge stars has a kind of u - shaped distribution with a minimum at [ fe / h]@xmath106 in [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane . in this case ,",
    "iron enrichment due to sne ia is almost completed at very high redshift , at which time a large amount of cold gas remains in galaxies .",
    "hence most of the stars existing at present form in subsequent starburst due to major mergers between such gas - rich systems . because starbursts tends to make stars at its late phase with the abundance pattern of sne ii ,",
    "if the system is gas - rich , many oxygen - enhanced iron - rich stars form during the starburst .",
    "thus this provides a constraint on the lifetime of sne ia , that is , @xmath41 should be rather long , @xmath107 gyr .",
    "the dependence of the [ fe / h ] distribution on @xmath41 is not as simple as the abundance ratio .",
    "these figures show that the lifetime @xmath41 seems to determine the width of [ fe / h ] distribution , that is , a shorter @xmath41 makes the [ fe / h ] distribution narrower .",
    "it could be related to the epoch of star formation . in the shorter @xmath108 case ,",
    "many intermediate stars explode as sne ia and begin to release metals into the interstellar medium before the major epoch of star formation compared with the reference model , therefore most of the stars have similar iron abundances , which makes the [ fe / h ] distribution narrow . in contrast , in the longer @xmath41 case , some of the stars form in iron - poor environments before most of the iron is released , and some of the stars form in iron - rich environments because at late epochs the gas fraction is low and iron is released into gas - poor systems .",
    "thus the [ fe / h ] distribution has a wider width .",
    "next , we investigate the dependence on star formation timescale . in figures [ fig : sft1 ] and [ fig : sft2 ] , we show models which are the same as the reference model , except for having twice and half the star formation timescale of the reference model , @xmath109 and 0.65 gyr , respectively .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : sft1]b , in the longer star formation timescale case , the break point in [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane for bulge stars moves towards lower [ fe / h ] , because the star formation epoch shifts to lower redshift and then the enrichment due to sne ia effectively begins earlier . in the case of a shorter star formation timescale , by contrast",
    ", the break point moves towards higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "thus we can say that the position of the break point is generally determined by a combination of the lifetime of sne ia and the star formation timescale , such as @xmath110 . in the longer @xmath26 case , there is a broader tail showing oxygen - enhancement at [ fe / h]@xmath111 than in the reference model .",
    "this is for the same reason as the case of shorter @xmath41 .",
    "the difference from the case with shorter @xmath108 is that the distribution is not u - shaped but an inverse triangle , because the sne ia continue enrichment at lower redshifts .",
    "disk stars also have the same dependence on the star formation timescale , but we can clearly see those tendencies for bulge stars .    the [ fe / h ] distribution shows a different tendency from the dependence on @xmath41 . in the case of longer and shorter @xmath26 , the distributions typically but slightly have lower and higher [ fe / h ] , respectively , at least for bulge stars .",
    "generally a longer star formation timescale results in a larger cold gas fraction . then , with the longer star formation timescale , the metallicity becomes lower than in a model with a shorter star formation timescale .",
    "in addition , such a longer star formation timescale decreases the amount of stars , which means that fewer metals are released from sne ia .",
    "thus the star formation timescale has a different effect from the lifetime of sne ia .    in the reference model , the star formation timescale",
    "is assumed to be constant with redshift .",
    "it is interesting to see how the redshift dependence affects the chemical enrichment . in @xcite , another formulation for the star formation timescale",
    "is considered ; it is proportional to the dynamical timescale of galactic disk , which is called the dynamical star formation ( dsf ) timescale model in that paper .",
    "because we assume the disk rotation velocity to be almost the same as the circular velocity of dark halos , which becomes larger toward higher redshift , the dynamical timescale becomes shorter toward higher redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : sft3 ] shows the results of adopting the dsf model , in which the star formation timescale at present is @xmath112 gyr , so as to produce an agreement of cold gas fraction in spiral galaxies with observation .",
    "we find that the position of the break point in [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane slightly moves toward higher [ fe / h ] , and the slope of [ o / fe ] against [ fe / h ] seems to be slightly steeper . in the dsf model ,",
    "since most of stars form at higher redshift than in the reference model due to the shorter star formation timescale at high redshift , enrichment of iron happens quickly .",
    "thus the slope is steeper and the typical [ fe / h ] is larger than in the reference model , but this effect is very small .    in figure [",
    "fig : sfr2 ] , we show star formation histories of those three models . the solid , dot - dashed and dotted lines indicate models with @xmath26=2.6gyr and 0.65gyr , and the dsf model , respectively .",
    "the dashed line denotes the infall model given by @xcite .",
    "the major star formation epochs of the models of @xmath109gyr and 0.65gyr are later and earlier than the reference model shown in figure [ fig : sfr1 ] .",
    "because a star formation timescale at high redshift in the dsf model is much shorter than that in the reference model , the major star formation epoch moves toward even earlier epoch than the model of @xmath113gyr . from this figure",
    ", thus we can reach the same conclusion as analyses by the infall model , that is , when major star formation finishes before iron enrichment due to sne ia becomes efficient , the break point in [ o / fe][fe / h ] moves toward higher [ fe / h ] because even sne ii alone sufficiently enrich stars .",
    "as long as we stay varying only the lifetime of sne ia , @xmath41 , and the star formation timescale , @xmath19 , our sa model seems to provide quite similar conclusions to the classical infall model .",
    "this apparent coincidence , however , breaks when the sn feedback is considered as shown in the next subsection .",
    "it has been widely realized that sn feedback significantly affects galaxy properties .",
    "strong energy feedback suppresses chemical enrichment due to sne ii because star formation is suppressed by expelling cold gas , and also most of the metals are expelled into the hot gas @xcite .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to investigate how sn feedback affects the enrichment due to both sne ii and sne ia .    in figures [ fig : snfb1 ] and [ fig :",
    "snfb2 ] , we show the same figures as figure [ fig : fid ] but for @xmath114 ( strong feedback ) and 70 ( weak feedback ) km  s@xmath11 , respectively , where @xmath23 determines the typical scale at which sn feedback becomes effective , that is , sn feedback strongly affects galaxies with @xmath115 .",
    "as clearly shown in the bottom panels , the [ fe / h ] distributions for both disk and bulge stars are strongly affected by sn feedback .",
    "strong feedback greatly suppresses formation of metal - rich stars and thus the chemical enrichment .",
    "in contrast , there are too few metal - poor stars in the case of weak sn feedback compared with the observed distributions , while the difference from the reference model is smaller than that of the strong sn feedback case .",
    "it should be noted that our mw - like galaxies have @xmath116 km  s@xmath11 at low redshift .",
    "the values of @xmath23 for both the reference model and the weak sn feedback case are less than the rotation velocity , while in the strong sn feedback case @xmath23 is larger than the rotation velocity .",
    "that means that sn feedback is very efficient even at low redshift in the strong feedback case .",
    "therefore the difference of the strong sn feedback case from the reference model is larger .",
    "the stronger the sn feedback is , the lower the [ fe / h ] at the break point is .",
    "consequently , strong and weak sn feedback seem to have similar effects in the [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane to those of short and long @xmath108 , and long and short @xmath26 .",
    "since strong sn feedback suppresses the chemical enrichment due to sne ii , the enrichment due to sne ia begins at a lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "these apparently correspond to longer and shorter star formation timescales , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : sfr3 ] shows star formation histories of the strong ( @xmath114 km  s@xmath11 ) and weak ( @xmath117 km  s@xmath11 ) feedback models indicated by the solid and dot - dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the dashed line denotes the infall model .",
    "the strong feedback model shows a similar star formation history to that of the long star formation timescale model ( the solid line in figure [ fig : sfr2 ] ) .",
    "both models have break points in [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane at slightly lower [ fe / h ] than that in the reference model .",
    "the peak of the [ fe / h ] distribution of the strong feedback model , however , moves toward lower [ fe / h ] compared with the long star formation timescale model .",
    "the weak feedback model shows a similar star formation history to that of the dsf model ( the dotted line in figure [ fig : sfr2 ] ) .",
    "the break points of both model move toward high [ fe / h ] compared with the reference model .",
    "again , the shift to higher [ fe / h ] in the [ fe / h ] distribution of the weak feedback model is slightly enhanced compared with the dsf model .",
    "this is because sn feedback strongly affects chemical enrichment . from equations ( [ eqn :",
    "mcold])-([eqn : zhot ] ) , we obtain a mass - weighted mean stellar metallicity , @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 is an initial metallicity of gas . at the limit @xmath121 , the mean",
    "metallicity becomes @xmath122 this shows that a strong sn feedback ( @xmath123 ) suppresses chemical enrichment due to sne ii .",
    "the effective chemical yield taking into account sn feedback can be written as @xmath124 .",
    "the effect of sn feedback on chemical enrichment is the reason why , for example , the strong feedback model and the long star formation timescale model predict different [ fe / h ] distributions in spite of their similar star formation histories .",
    "therefore , similar star formation histories do not always provide similar chemical enrichment histories .",
    "gas outflow induced by sne ii plays a critical role in galaxy evolution .",
    "we have explored chemical enrichment due to both sne ii and sne ia in milky way - like galaxies in the semi - analytic galaxy formation model .",
    "our treatment of sne ia is fully consistent with the galaxy formation model , that is , we solve for the recycling of each element among stars , cold gas and hot gas based on a @xmath5cdm model .",
    "it is important to follow the chemical enrichment in the framework of the hierarchical galaxy formation because there are many non - trivial effects on the chemical enrichment caused not only by mergers of galaxies but by varying efficiencies of the sn feedback dependent on the depth of gravitational potential wells of sub - galactic clumps . as a first attempt at constructing such a consistent model ,",
    "we have assumed that all sne ia have the same lifetime , @xmath41 , that abundance patterns of metals from sne ia and sne ii are always the same , and that massive stars instantaneously explode as sne ii and release metals .",
    "this is a natural extension of the work by @xcite , in which they self - consistently modeled the chemical enrichment due to sne ia and sne ii .",
    "we have picked out galaxies in dark halos with @xmath15 km  s@xmath11 and having a similar luminosity to the mw .",
    "we have found that when we impose @xmath41=1.5 gyr , the predictions of our model for such mw - like galaxies agree well with observations of the chemical composition of solar - neighborhood stars both in the stellar distribution in the [ o / fe]-[fe / h ] plane and in the iron mdf .",
    "we would like to stress that the other model parameters such as the star formation timescale and sn feedback are the same as in the fiducial model of @xcite , in which they found that the model reproduce well many aspects of observed galaxies , such as luminosity functions , cold gas fractions and sizes of galaxies for local galaxies , and the surface brightnesses , velocity dispersions , mass - to - light ratios and metallicities of local dwarf spheroidals .",
    "this work also shows that the classical g - dwarf problem @xcite is fully resolved in the framework of hierarchical formation of galaxies , in which the infall term introduced in the infall models to avoid the g - dwarf problem is naturally explained by the mixture of such physical processes as clustering of dark halos , gas cooling and sn feedback .",
    "our model passes the new tests , that is , the iron mdf and the abundance pattern of metals , taking into account chemical enrichment due to sne ia . as shown in section [ sec : depend ] , the abundance pattern provides an independent constraint on galaxy formation .",
    "therefore our results would support the scenario of hierarchical formation of galaxies . while observational data used in this work have been limited to solar - neighborhood and bulge stars in the milky way",
    ", future observations of stars in other galaxies will provide statistically better constraints on galaxy formation .    in our model , disk and bulge",
    "stars are treated separately .",
    "while the observations of bulge stars still have uncertainties , our model also reproduces well both the distribution of stars in the [ o / fe][fe / h ] plane and the [ fe / h ] distribution . in particular ,",
    "although there are only a few bulge stars whose oxygen abundance is observed , our model predicts oxygen - enhanced stars at [ fe / h]@xmath111 , but they are not a dominant fraction . increasing observational data will provide a strong constraint on bulge formation .    as a by - product",
    ", we have obtained the luminosity function of galaxies in local group - halos .",
    "recent high - resolution @xmath125-body simulations have predicted many more dwarf scale dark halos than observed satellite galaxies , and this has been considered to be a serious problem @xcite .",
    "such an overabundance problem has been solved in the framework of the sa models taking into account effects of reionization and incompleteness due to significantly low surface brightness @xcite .",
    "our model also shows an ability to solve this problem in a similar manner to those works .",
    "the chemical yields we used are the same as those in @xcite , in which an infall model of monolithic collapse was used @xcite .",
    "the similarity between our hierarchical model and the monolithic cloud collapse model suggests that spiral galaxies in a hierarchical universe should have a similar formation history to that modeled by the monolithic cloud collapse model , as shown in @xcite .",
    "star formation histories we computed also suggests the similarities .",
    "it does , however , not always mean that similar star formation histories provide similar chemical enrichment histories .",
    "as shown in section 6.3 and more directly by equation ( [ eqn : zbeta ] ) , sn feedback plays a critical role in chemical enrichment .",
    "in this paper we have concentrated on investigating the [ o / fe ] relation and the [ fe / h ] distribution . since",
    "recent analyses of solar - neighborhood stars have revealed that the age - metallicity relation has a large scatter , it will be useful as a next step to see whether our model can reproduce this relation as well as the scatter in it @xcite . furthermore , while the analysis in this paper focused only on mw - like galaxies , our sa model has the potential ability to investigate other systems simultaneously . to investigate abundance ratios in such systems as the intracluster medium , the stars composing elliptical galaxies , and damped ly-@xmath1 systems will provide independent , important clues to understanding galaxy formation .",
    "the cosmic explosion rate of sne ia will also give a new insight into both galaxy formation and observational cosmology .",
    "we will pursue these topics in future papers .",

    "<S> we investigate chemical evolution in milky way - like galaxies based on the cold dark matter model in which cosmic structures form via hierarchical merging . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce chemical enrichment due to type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) into the mitaka semi - analytic galaxy formation model developed by nagashima & yoshii . for the first time we derive distributions of stellar metallicities and their ratios in milky way - like galaxies treating chemical enrichment due to sne ia in a hierarchical galaxy formation model self - consistently . as a first attempt , </S>",
    "<S> we assume all sne ia to have the same lifetime , and assume instantaneous recycling for type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our model reproduces well the metal abundance ratio [ o / fe ] against [ fe / h ] and the iron metallicity distribution function in the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the so - called g - dwarf problem is resolved by the hierarchical formation of galaxies , and a gas infall term introduced in traditional monolithic collapse models to solve this problem is well explained by the mixture of some physical processes such as hierarchical merging of dark halos , gas cooling , energy feedback and injection of gas and metals into hot gas due to supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts more oxygen - enhanced stars in bulges at [ fe / h ] @xmath0 than in disks . </S>",
    "<S> this trend seems to be supported by recent observations while they have still uncertainties </S>",
    "<S> . more data in number and accuracy will provide independent and important constraints on galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> for the better understanding of the chemical enrichment due to sne ia in hierarchical galaxy formation , we discuss how physical processes affect the metal abundance ratio by varying the lifetime of sne ia , the star formation timescale and the strength of supernova feedback . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the supernova feedback plays a key role among them and therefore there is no one - to - one correspondence between star formation histories and stellar metallicity - ratio distributions . </S>"
