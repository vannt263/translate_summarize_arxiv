    "the low energy runs currently being performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite aim at an exploration of the qcd phase diagram at non - zero temperature ( @xmath5 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) through the measurement of fluctuations of conserved charges , @xmath7 , net baryon number , electric charge and strangeness . for the former ,",

    "in order to analyze fluctuations of conserved charges , we perform calculations on gauge field configurations generated in our study of the finite - temperature transition in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd @xcite .",
    "these calculations were performed with the hisq / tree action for three values of the lattice cut - off corresponding to lattices with temporal extent @xmath43 and @xmath44 and a spatial lattice extent @xmath45 .",
    "the calculations cover a temperature range , @xmath46 . in this temperature range the line of constant physics is defined by tuning the strange quark mass @xmath47 to its physical value and setting the light quark masses to @xmath48 , which correspond to a pion mass @xmath49  mev .",
    "it is important to note that the definition of physical quark and/or pion masses is not straightforward in calculations with staggered fermions at non - zero values of the lattice spacing due to taste symmetry breaking .",
    "taste symmetry breaking , which is a consequence of the doubling problem in the staggered formulation , gives rise to sixteen pseudo - scalar mesons corresponding to the sixteen elements of the clifford algebra , of which only one , with taste matrix @xmath50 , behaves as a goldstone particle at finite lattice spacing . even in the chiral limit ,",
    "the other 15 modes receive masses of @xmath8 which vanish only in the continuum limit .",
    "thus , as a result of taste symmetry breaking , these sixteen modes contribute to observables with different masses . the same is true of all other states , but the problem is most severe for goldstone modes .",
    "the size of these effects has been quantified for the staggered fermion discretization scheme exploited here ( hisq / tree ) by measuring the masses of the sixteen taste pions and by defining a root - mean - squared mass  @xcite , @xmath51 taste symmetry breaking also affects the generation of the ensemble of gauge configurations on which measurements are made . to simulate the desired number of flavors , the fourth - root of the staggered fermion determinant is taken for each flavor .",
    "while this `` rooting '' trick corrects for the number of flavors in the continuum limit , at finite lattice spacings , the masses of states contributing to the partition function are not degenerate .    with the improved staggered fermion action ( hisq / tree ) used in our calculation , taste violations , while strongly suppressed , are still large  @xcite .",
    "in fact , our analysis showed that the hisq / tree action has the smallest taste violations compared to the other improved staggered actions ( p4 , asqtad and stout ) used in finite temperature calculations . nevertheless , at values of the cut - off corresponding to the transition region ( @xmath4  mev ) on the three different @xmath52 lattices analyzed by us , the rms masses vary from @xmath53  mev on our finest lattices ( @xmath54 ) to @xmath55  mev on the coarsest lattice ( @xmath56 ) , in contrast to the goldstone pion mass @xmath57 mev  @xcite .",
    "we also find that , to a good approximation , the difference of @xmath58 and the physical pion mass @xmath59 is proportional to the square of the lattice cut - off at a fixed value of the temperature , @xmath60 . in this paper",
    "we show that the cut - off effects resulting from a much heavier rms mass influence most strongly the electric charge fluctuations as these are most sensitive to the contributions from pions .",
    "it is worth pointing out , for comparison , that to obtain an rms mass of about @xmath61  mev achieved with the hisq / tree action on @xmath62 lattices will require @xmath63 with the asqtad and stout actions  @xcite .",
    "we typically analyzed 10,00020,000 gauge field configurations per parameter set for @xmath64 , 10,00014,000 configurations for @xmath65 and up to 6000 configurations for @xmath62 lattices .",
    "measurements of all operators needed to calculate quadratic fluctuations have been performed every 10 hybrid monte carlo time units for @xmath62 and every 10 or 20 time units for @xmath66 lattices .",
    "most of our quark number susceptibilities on the @xmath64 and @xmath67 lattices were calculated on gpu - clusters and we used 5001500 random source vectors for the analysis .",
    "the @xmath62 data were analyzed using 400 random source vectors at low temperatures and 100 at high temperatures .",
    "when performing lattice qcd calculations at non - zero temperature , we have to control ( at least ) two different sources of cut - off errors . on the one hand",
    "there is the intrinsic cut - off dependence of the observables calculated at non - zero temperature at a certain value of the cut - off @xmath68 .",
    "we reduce these by working with tree - level @xmath69 improved actions in the gauge as well as the fermion sector .",
    "this improvement also insures that at high temperature the cut - off dependence of the basic operators entering our calculations is small .",
    "an additional cut - off dependence arises due to the choice of the zero temperature observable used to set the scale for all finite temperature measurements .",
    "we investigate two different scale - setting observables : the length scale @xmath70 extracted from the slope of the static quark potential , @xmath71 and the kaon decay constant @xmath72 .",
    "the temperature in these units is @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the efficacy of these observables in setting the scale is complementary in many respects  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we note that @xmath70 has a mild dependence on the quark masses and is well defined even in the infinite quark mass limit . the kaon decay",
    "constant , on the other hand , has a sizeable quark mass dependence , and at lattice spacings used in this study , it is sensitive to taste symmetry violations in the hadron spectrum . to convert to physical units , we use @xmath75  fm @xcite and the latest pdg value for the kaon decay constant , @xmath76  mev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] , we show the difference in the two estimates of temperature over the interval relevant to the calculations performed here .",
    "the leading order correction contributing to this difference is @xmath77 .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , we also find that in the study of charge fluctuations it is advantageous to use the @xmath72 scale as it absorbs a significant fraction of the cut - off effects , @xmath78 , the cut - off effects are similar and cancel to a large extent in the ratio of hadron masses and temperature , @xmath79 .",
    "however , it should be stressed that any one observable ( @xmath70 or @xmath72 ) can not eliminate cut - off effects in all observables equally well .",
    "we elaborate on this point in more detail in the appendix .",
    "we start our discussion of the fluctuations of baryon number , strangeness and electric charge by summarizing the data obtained on lattices with temporal extent @xmath43 and @xmath44 in tables  [ tab : chi2_6 ] , [ tab : chi2_8 ] and [ tab : chi2_12 ] and discussing their scaling behavior . the continuum extrapolation and comparison to the hrg model as well as",

    "we therefore use the @xmath72 temperature scale in the rest of the paper unless stated otherwise .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2qs ] , we show results for fluctuations of net strangeness ( left ) and net electric charge ( right ) using @xmath72 to set the scale for the temperature .",

    "the electric charge fluctuations deviate significantly from hrg results at all temperatures and show large cut - off dependence . these large cut - off effects in @xmath80",
    "can mostly be explained as due to discretization errors in the lattice hadron spectrum .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath80 at low temperatures comes from pions , while @xmath81 receives the leading contribution from kaons and @xmath82 from nucleons . as discussed in section  [ sec : lattice ] , the pion spectrum is strongly affected by taste symmetry violations in the staggered formulation , and it has been shown in earlier work that the agreement in @xmath80 between lattice qcd results and hrg model calculations can be improved using a distorted spectrum in the hrg analysis  @xcite .    to confirm this observation",

    "[ fig : chi2qs ] ( right panel ) the hrg results obtained after replacing the physical pion mass by the rms pion mass relevant to our calculations on the @xmath64 , 8 and 12 lattices , respectively . these cut - off effects leading to the spectral distortion",
    "vary not only with @xmath52 but also with temperatures at fixed @xmath52 .",
    "we therefore parametrize the cut - off dependence of @xmath58 , at each @xmath52 , using a cubic polynomial fit to the data given in  @xcite .",

    "the data confirm that below @xmath83  mev , the numerical results for @xmath80 are well described by this minimally modified hrg model and the major part of the difference is indeed due to the taste symmetry breaking effects in the pion sector .",
    "since all other heavier states contributing to the hrg model are assumed to take on their physical values , the fluctuations of strangeness and baryon number are not influenced by this modification of the hrg model .",
    "we discuss these features , together with continuum extrapolations , for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2b ] and [ fig : chi2qs ] in more detail in the following subsection .",
    "it is worthwhile to clarify our discussion of the comparison of lattice qcd data with the hrg model .",
    "when we say that the hrg is a good approximation to qcd , we refer to the value of the susceptibility , as is traditional . at the temperature where this agreement fails , we observe that not only the value but the slope also deviates significantly . our data also indicate that the curvature starts to deviate 2030 mev earlier depending on the observable . these derivatives of the susceptibility are related to higher moments , which are increasingly less well captured in the hrg analysis and have not been calculated in our lattice simulations .      in this section ,",
    "we analyze cut - off effects at fixed values of the temperature for three values of the lattice spacing , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we perform this analysis for temperature scales defined in terms of both @xmath70 and @xmath72 in order to quantify systematic effects at a given lattice spacing and to demonstrate consistency between the estimates in the continuum limit .",
    "our simulations on the lattices with the three different @xmath52 values have not been done at the same values of the temperature . as a result , in order to perform continuum extrapolations at fixed temperature , we have used cubic spline interpolations of our data throughout this paper .",
    "we propagate errors on the spline parameters .",
    "we first discuss the continuum extrapolation for the three susceptibilities shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : chi2b ] and [ fig : chi2qs ] at high temperature , @xmath86  mev . in this regime , cut - off effects are generally small , which , to some extent , is due to the fact that our numerical calculations have been performed with an @xmath8 improved action with small cut - off dependence of thermodynamic observables in the infinite temperature ideal gas limit @xcite . in fig .",

    "continuum extrapolated results for @xmath80 , are smaller than the hrg model results by about 1020% .",
    "even though at temperatures below @xmath128  mev , estimates for electric charge fluctuations have large systematic errors due to the distortion of the light meson spectrum in all staggered formulations , our analysis shows that these effects can be taken into account when performing continuum extrapolations .",
    "we show that the resulting continuum estimates in the transition region lie below the hrg estimates even after corrections accounting for the distorted pion spectrum have been applied .",
    "thus , our conclusion is that at the highest rhic energies and at the lhc , the width of probability distribution for the net electric charge should be narrower than what hrg model calculations would suggest since @xmath80 in eq .",

    "it is worth noting that a comparison of @xmath155 with the ratio of proton to net charge fluctuations , which is accessible in heavy ion collisions , will allow us to relate fluctuations in the proton number to the fluctuations of the conserved net baryon number  @xcite .    finally , we point out that the continuum extrapolated results presented here , and summarized in table  [ tab : fluctuations ] in a temperature regime relevant to the freeze - out conditions in heavy ion collisions , do not rely on any uncertainties in the determination of the qcd crossover temperature or its characterization through different observables as discussed in  @xcite",
