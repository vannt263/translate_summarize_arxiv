    "the structure of the electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath12 has been precisely tested by various collider experiments such as the lep and slc .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of the higgs boson at the cern lhc supports the existence of an @xmath3 doublet scalar field which is required to realize the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak symmetry in the minimal way .",
    "however , these facts do not necessarily mean that the @xmath5 gauge symmetry describes the most fundamental theory .",
    "for example , models based on a larger gauge group containing the @xmath5 subgroup can also explain the current experimental results .    among various possibilities for the extension of the electroweak symmetry ,",
    "the choice of the @xmath4 group gives us an interesting consequence that the color triplet and the three generations for each type of fermions are related with each other due to the gauge anomaly cancellation  @xcite , while these two matters are irrelevant in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "so far , a variety of models based on @xmath0 , the so - called 331 models , have been discussed , where there are various ways to identify the electric charge @xmath13 due to the rank two nature of the @xmath14 group and various embedding schemes of the sm fermions .",
    "we can classify these 331 models as listed in table  [ xis ] .",
    "in this paper , we study the phenomenology of a 331 model especially focusing on the higgs sector . in our model ,",
    "the higgs sector is composed of three @xmath1 triplet scalar fields , which corresponds to the minimal choice to realize phenomenologically acceptable scenario triplets are enough to break the @xmath4 symmetry into @xmath15 , and such a model has been discussed in ref .",
    "however in this configuration , the lightest up - type and down - type quarks become massless , so that it is difficult to reproduce the current data from flavour experiments . ] . after the breaking of @xmath4 into @xmath5",
    ", our model can effectively be regarded as the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) .",
    "the characteristic property of the higgs sector is particularly seen in the structure of the yukawa interactions , where the first and the second generation quarks couple to the different higgs doublet from that couples to the third generation quarks .",
    "although this inevitably causes the flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) mediated by higgs bosons at the tree level , and it forces to set masses of the higgs bosons to be typically @xmath16 tev or larger .",
    "however , we find that we can avoid the current bound from flavour experiments even if we take masses of the higgs bosons to be of the order of 100 gev by taking an alignment limit of the mass matrix of the cp - even higgs bosons , which is naturally obtained in the limit where the breaking scale of @xmath2 to be infinity .    in the allowed parameter regions ,",
    "we first discuss the deviation in the sm - like higgs boson couplings from the sm predictions .",
    "we clarify that our model predicts a characteristic pattern of the deviation in the quark yukawa couplings which has a dependence on the quark flavour .",
    "this nature can not be seen in thdms with a softly - broken @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "next , we discuss the decay and production of the extra higgs bosons at the lhc .",
    "we find that the flavour violating decay modes of the extra cp - even @xmath17 and cp - odd @xmath18 and singly - charged @xmath19 higgs bosons can be dominant , e.g. , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "<S> we investigate the phenomenology of a model based on the @xmath0 gauge theory , the so - called 331 model . </S>",

    "<S> after the spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath2 , our higgs sector effectively becomes that with two @xmath3 doublet scalar fields , in which the first and the second generation quarks couple to the different higgs doublet from that couples to the third generation quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this structure causes the flavour changing neutral current mediated by higgs bosons at the tree level . by taking an alignment limit of the mass matrix for the cp - even higgs bosons , which is naturally realized in the case with the breaking scale of @xmath4 to be much larger than that of @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , we can avoid current constraints from flavour experiments such as the @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing even for the higgs bosons masses being @xmath8 gev . in this allowed parameter space </S>",
    "<S> , we clarify that a characteristic deviation in quark yukawa couplings of the standard model - like higgs boson is predicted , which has a different pattern from that seen in two higgs doublet models with a softly - broken @xmath9 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the flavour violating decay modes of the extra higgs boson , e.g. , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be dominant , and they yield the important signature to distinguish our model from the two higgs doublet models . </S>"
