    "there is an extensive use in wave - packet ( wp ) propagation calculations in complex absorbing potentials ( caps ) .",
    "the use of caps in propagation of wp calculations is usually for half collision experiments where the initial wave - packet is localized in the interaction region where the caps are vanished .",
    "the role of the caps is to avoid the reflection from the edge of the grid as obtained in the numerical propagation calculations .",
    "often caps are referred to as optical potentials .",
    "the caps are used in very different fields of physics , chemistry and technology .",
    "see for example : calculations of resonances for caps in a nuclear physics problem@xcite ; deriving new expressions that simplify the numerical calculations of state - to - state transitions probabilities for reactive scattering collisions ( for time independent hamiltonians see ref.@xcite and for time dependent ones see ref.@xcite ) ; calculations of complex molecular potential energy surfaces by caps@xcite ; and molecular electronic studies where the cap serves to absorb charge reaching the electrodes@xcite . beside the use of caps in the numerical calculations",
    "an effort has been taken in developing different type of caps .",
    "see for example ref.@xcite where recently new type of caps were developed . for a most recent review on caps",
    "see ref.@xcite .    in 1998",
    "we have derived caps by applying the smooth - exterior - scaling transformations ( ses ) to the hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "here we study the _ conjecture _ that the use of exterior - scaling or ses similarity transformations , produce reflection free caps ( rf - caps ) for the wp propagation calculations . as we will show here within the finite basis - set or finite grid approximations the caps are not reflection free ones .",
    "however , it is possible to show that for a given finite basis / grid method a quantity criteria for the strength of the numerical reflections can be derived .",
    "it is important to mention that about the same time riss and mayer@xcite obtained caps , which under specific conditions are similar to the ses - caps , by taking another approach ( so called transformative - cap ) .",
    "only when the cap is introduced in a region where the potential energy has been vanished , the transformative - cap derived by riss and meyer @xcite is equal to the ses - cap that has been derived analytically without any approximations by us@xcite ( in such a case the ses - cap and the transformative - cap are identical although they look slightly different ) .",
    "our main motivation for deriving ses - caps was to simplify the calculations of resonances positions and widths .",
    "however , this ses - cap has been used also to avoid the artificial reflections from the edge of the grid in wave - packet ( wp ) propagation calculations@xcite .",
    "one may wonder , what is the need for the transformative - caps or the ses - caps since the reflections can be taken as small as one wishes by introducing the cap in the domain where the physical potential is zero and by making the cap ( any cap ) soft and long enough@xcite .",
    "the answer to that question is that it is most desired to avoid the use of long ranged caps which require large number of basis functions or large number of grid points in heavy duty numerical calculations .",
    "for example , in propagation calculations of many electron molecular systems it is hard to avoid the introduction of the cap in the domain where the physical long range potential is not zero .",
    "here we want to discuss two type of questions .",
    "the first type are mathematical - physical questions ( i.e. , theoretical questions in the sense that we assume that complete basis sets are used ) . such as ,",
    "- what are the properties of reflection free caps ?",
    "( as we show here , there are two conditions that should be satisfied )",
    ".    - can we introduce the rf - cap in the domain where the physical potential is not zero and the propagated wave packet does not consists of out going waves only ?",
    "( as we show the answer is yes ) .",
    "- can the initial state be exponentially localized in the interaction region , as required in half - collision experiments , where the cap vanishes ? ( the answer is yes ) .",
    "- can the initial state be localized in the domain where @xmath2 ? ( the answer is yes , provided the smooth - exterior scaling transformation is applied to the initial state ) .",
    "the second type are practical questions .    -",
    "are indeed the rf - caps reflection free in the numerical calculations where finite number of grid - points or finite of basis functions are used ?",
    "( the answer is no since in spite of the complete absorbing of the fast moving components of the wavepacket still there is an edge - grid reflection effect which is associated with the slow moving components of the wp ) .",
    "- can we minimize the reflections which result from the use of finite sized basis / grid methods and how ?",
    "( the answer is yes , by methods explained in the paper ) .",
    "- can we apply the rf - caps to many electron problems ?",
    "( the answer is yes provided the electronic repulsion terms , @xmath3 are modified .",
    "this requirement can be avoided when the ionized electrons are not correlated ) .",
    "first , we should describe the numerical problem we want to solve by introducing a cap into the hamiltonian . using the hermitian quantum mechanics the propagated wave packet",
    "is given by , @xmath4    in the numerical calculations the propagated wave packet is @xmath5 .",
    "we are looking for numerical methods for which , @xmath6 where @xmath7 determines the requirement accuracy from the numerical results . since in the numerical calculations",
    "only finite number of grid points or finite number of basis functions are used , the available spatial space is not from @xmath8 to @xmath9 but up to @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , accurate results are obtained as long as @xmath11 vanishes at @xmath12 . by increasing the number of the grid - points or by increasing",
    "the number of the basis functions we increase the value of l. the initial state , @xmath13 , is a square integrable function . in half collision experiments ( such in photo - dissociative or auto - ionization reactions )",
    "the initial wp is localized in the interaction region where @xmath14 .",
    "however , as time passes the wave - packet spreads and only during a given period of time @xmath15 , the numerical calculations satisfy the accuracy condition stated above .",
    "it is important to realize that the value of @xmath15 is determined by the time it takes for the tail of the wave - packet to reach the edge of spatial space ( i.e. , r = l ) . in order to obtain @xmath16 within the desired accuracy",
    ", one should increase the number of the used grid / basis points / functions and thereby increase the value of l. _ the role of the cap is to enable one to obtain accurate numerical results in the limited available spatial space , @xmath17 , without the need to increase the number of grid / basis points / functions_. namely , @xmath18 where due to the use of the finite grid / basis - set numerical methods , @xmath19 the cap is defined such that , @xmath20 and , @xmath21 a common requirement is that , @xmath22 as a matter of fact the last condition is too strong and it is possible to satisfy eq.[phicapeqexact ] also when the initial state is localized in the region where the cap gets non zero values .",
    "this extension will be discussed later .",
    "short range cap ( the saxson - wood potential ) has been used about two decades ago in molecular wave - packet calculations@xcite . a cap which has been used often in the literature @xcite is @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 for @xmath27 . for large values of n",
    "these caps are very similar to the purely imaginary step type potential that has been shown above to provide a strong reflection .",
    "regarding the reflections due to the introducing of abrupt complex potentials one might be aware to the fact that there are examples ( see the review in ref.@xcite and references therein ) of discontinuous potentials that are constructed to avoid reflection , and absorb totally , at single incident energies , or in certain momentum intervals , or at a discrete set of energies .",
    "of course they cause reflections at other energies . the caps that we are looking for",
    "are different ones .",
    "they are energy independent rf - caps , and in principle can be chosen to be universal ones ( i.e. , problem independent ) .    as we will show here",
    "it is unlikely to have a universal ( i.e. , problem independent ) cap for which both eq.[phicapeq0 ] and eq.[phicapeqexact ] are satisfied .",
    "therefore , let us first discuss the possibility to satisfy eq.[phicapeqexact ] when the condition given by eq.[phicapeq0 ] is replaced by a weaker numerical condition : @xmath28 is a square integrable function at any given time , which decays to zero much _",
    "faster _ than the exact solution .",
    "such that within a given time interval , @xmath29 where the value of @xmath7 is determined from the desired accuracy of the numerical calculations .",
    "the idea of introducing rf - caps by using the exterior scaling or ses methods is clear : the hamiltonian remains as it is inside the inner region , where the coordinates stay on the real axis .",
    "however , it has been shown by simon that upon the exterior scaling transformation , @xmath30 where inside the inner unscaled region , @xmath31 and in the external - scaled region , @xmath32 the eigenfunctions are _ not equal _ to eigenfunctions of the unscaled ( i.e. , hermitian ) problem _ inside _ the unscaled region@xcite .",
    "for example , for a free particle hamiltonian the continuum eigenfunctions inside the inner unscaled region are given by , @xmath33 .",
    "since the propagated wp can be described as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the complex scaled ( or exterior scaled ) hamiltonian , it is not clear at all that in this case eq.[phicapeqexact ] is satisfied ( here we consider the exterior scaled hamiltonian as @xmath34 ) .",
    "this result is very confusing since from numerical propagation calculations we know that inside the inner unscaled region in space , the propagated wp is exactly as obtained without the use of exterior - scaling . as we will show below the validity eq.[phicapeqexact ]",
    "can be easily explained by association the ses approach with the use of similarity transformation operators as developed in ref.@xcite . using the ses approach , @xmath35 where the path in the complex coordinate space is chosen such that , @xmath36 and , @xmath37",
    "the ses transformations clearly show that eq.[phicapeqexact ] can be satisfied to any desired accuracy .",
    "if the ses transformation is represented by the similarity operator , @xmath38 , than the propagated wp within the framework of the ses approach is given by @xmath39 which is equal to @xmath40 inside the inner region ( see eq.[ses - inner ] ) where @xmath41 .",
    "let us discuss now the validity of eq.[phicapsquareintegrable ] .",
    "following simon s proof for the exterior scaled potential and following moiseyev and hirschfelder s proof for general complex scaled transformations@xcite ( including the ses transformations ) , the complex scaled resonances functions are square integrable but the continuum eigenfunctions are not square integrable functions .",
    "they are associated with complex eigenvalues , @xmath42 .",
    "such that @xmath43 in the _ exterior _ region is equal to the same value as obtained in hermitian quantum mechanics , i.e. , @xmath44 ( note that a very different result is obtained in the inner region as discussed in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "therefore , the asymptote of the continuum wavefunctions as obtained after the application of the exterior or ses transformations , remain as obtained within the framework of the conventional ( i.e. , hermitian ) qm approach . upon complex scaling @xmath45",
    "is rotated into the lower - half complex k - plane to avoid the exponentially divergence of the complex scaled incoming waves associated with real and positive values for the wave vector , i.e. , @xmath46 , as @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , it is no obvious weather a square integrable wp such as , @xmath48 as @xmath49 , remains square integrable when @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "it has been proven by moiseyev and katriel@xcite that for sufficiently small values of @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 , the eigenfunctions of a complex scaled hamiltonian which are associated with the bound states are square integrable .",
    "the value of @xmath54 depends on the shape of the potential@xcite .",
    "let us assume that the wave - packet is a gaussian , @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 remains square integrable provided that , @xmath57 .",
    "when the wave - packet is more localized , for example is described as @xmath58 , then @xmath59 . since gaussians form an over - complete basis set , one might expect that any square integrable function ( which can be expanded in term of the gaussian basis set ) remains square integrable after applying the complex scaling or the ses transformation .",
    "it is easy to prove that the wave - packet @xmath60 decays exponentially to zero at any given time , provided it is a square integrable function at t=0 .",
    "a proof which holds also for complex scaled non - hermitian hamiltonians is as follow : @xmath61 .",
    "for sufficiently small value of dt , @xmath62 is a converged series ( provided @xmath63 ) .",
    "if @xmath64 is a square integrable function than @xmath65 is square integrable as well ( the second derivative of a square integrable function is square integrable and the product of a square integrable function and a confined ( complex scaled ) potential is also a square integrable function ) .",
    "let us summarize the facts we know by now : ( 1 ) when the initial wave - packet ( wp ) is square integrable the time propagated wp is square integrable as well ; ( 2 ) the complex scaled square integrable wp remains square integrable ; ( 3 ) the complex scaled incoming waves diverge exponentially whereas the outgoing waves exponentially decay to zero ; ( 4 ) in the absence of a source of particles in infinite large distance from the studied system , the asymptote of the propagated wp consists of out going waves only ( as in half collision experiments ) . from ( 1)-(3 ) it is clear that for the most general case the square integrable wp , @xmath66 remains square integrable , @xmath67 although each one of the components of the complex scaled incoming waves exponentially diverge .",
    "when the condition ( 4 ) is not satisfied this fact ( i.e. , interference of exponentially diverged incoming waves results in a square integrable function ) may introduce some numerical difficulties in the propagation calculations . for overcoming these type of numerical difficulties when long ranged potentials are used",
    "see the second reference in ref.@xcite .    when condition ( 4 ) is satisfied ( as in all half collisions experiments ) then , @xmath68 and it is easy to see that @xmath69 decays faster since , @xmath70 the fact that within the interval of @xmath71 , the propagated wp , @xmath28 , decays _",
    "faster _ than @xmath72 , is the main motivation behind the use of the exterior scaling , smooth - exterior complex scaling methods in the numerical propagation calculations .",
    "from eq.[asymptotephicap ] a quantity criteria for the strength of the numerical reflections from the edge of the grid is obtained , @xmath73 as an upper limit for the accuracy of the calculations one gets that , @xmath74    at t=0 the initial wave - packet gets exponentially small values at @xmath12 and therefore we can consider it as a case where , @xmath75 . as time passes",
    "the wavelet with the largest value of k ( associated with a large velocity ) is the first to reach the edge of the grid .",
    "as one can see from eq.[upper - limit ] the fast moving components of the wavepacket are entirely absorbed at @xmath10 , due the use of the complex absorbing boundary conditions which were introduced by the use of the exterior scaling or the ses transformations .",
    "for the components of the wavepacket associated with small values of k , the requirement of @xmath76 is satisfied by increasing the value of l. the propagation calculations using ses transformations , within the framework of the finite basis - set / grid approximations , are accurate as long as @xmath77 gets sufficiently small values .",
    "this explains why l in eq.[phicapsquareintegrable ] is a function of time and why the duration of the propagation calculations can not exceed a given period of time , t , when l is held fixed in the propagation calculations .    as an illustrative example we carried out wavepacket propagation calculations for a one - dimensional gaussian , @xmath78 , which is localized at a potential",
    "well embedded in between two identical potential barriers .",

    "we can summarize it by saying that for the caps derived from the ses transformations@xcite : ( 1 ) the propagated wp decays faster to zero than the exact solution and therefore at any given time we can use a smaller grid / basis in the numerical calculations when the ses - caps are introduced into the numerical calculations ; ( 2 ) the ses - caps can be introduced also in the region where the interaction potential is active ( provided the edge of the grid is in the region where the exact wp has outgoing wave components only ) ; ( 3 ) the use of ses - caps enables one to introduce the caps also in the region where the initial wp does not get zero values ; ( 4 ) the duration of the wp calculations which provide accurate results ( avoiding the numerical reflections from the edge of the grid ) can be easily estimated ( see fig .",
