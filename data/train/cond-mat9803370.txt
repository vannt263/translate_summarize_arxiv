    "the manner in which proteins relax to their equilibrium or folded configurations is an important subject of current research@xcite . in particular the folding kinetics , namely the asymptotics of the relaxation of a physical quantity such as the total energy ,",

    "we shall provide both numerical and theoretical results concerning the asymptotic behavior of relaxation of a model protein following a rapid temperature quench from high to low .",
    "we emphasize and attempt to answer the very relevant question : what is the true ( possible ) asymptotics of such a relaxation of a protein ?",
    "due to the complex nature of this question , we shall use a simplified protein model for our numerical simulations which is based on the monomer - monomer interaction matrix of ref .",
    "@xcite ; and our analytical work is based on the hierarchically constrained dynamics for glassy relaxation@xcite",
    ".    there existed studies of the relaxational dynamics or related equilibrium properties of protein - like heteropolymers where part or the whole of the monomer - monomer interaction is modeled by a stochastic term@xcite .",
    "this random interaction clearly gives rise to a complicated free energy landscape with a large number of highly degenerate energy levels .",
    "these heteopolymers are believed to simulate certain protein behavior : interesting and important results for our intuitive understanding of the folding kinetics have been obtained through these studies . using a lattice copolymer model with metropolis monte carlo dynamics , ref .",
    "@xcite examined the folding kinetics as a function of the simulation time @xmath0 for various temperature @xmath1 , starting from an unfolded initial copolymer configuration .",
    "importantly , the folding of the copolymer was found to take place in a two - stage process : a rapid collapse followed by a slower adjustment toward the ground state , for a broad range of temperatures . a kinetically defined glass transition temperature @xmath2 and a thermodynamically defined folding temperature @xmath3",
    "were naturally found from the copolymer simulation data@xcite .",
    "these temperature scales were used to characterize the foldability of the polymers@xcite .",
    "refs.@xcite directly measured the relaxation of the total system energy @xmath4 for a random heteropolymer after a temperature quench where the interaction parameters between the monomers were drawn from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the monte carlo@xcite and molecular dynamics@xcite data were well fit to a stretched exponential form as a function of the simulation time @xmath0 .",
    "one additional interesting finding of these simulations was that for longer heteropolymers the collapse followed a two - stage process@xcite characterized by different sketching exponents , while for short chains only one stage was found@xcite .",
    "along another line of development , fruitful results have been obtained from analyzing even simpler discrete models such as the random energy model@xcite .",
    "the application of this model to protein folding was carried out in ref .",

    "interestingly , the random energy model gives different relaxation asymptotics depending on the details of the transition matrix between different microstates@xcite even though the detailed balance condition has been enforced .",
    "indeed , power - law@xcite decay or logarithmic@xcite decay were both obtained .",
    "this is to be compared with the possible stretched exponential decay@xcite form .",
    "previous investigations indicated clearly that a detailed analysis of the energy level distribution is one requirement for understanding the related relaxation modes .",
    "however , this is not sufficient to determine the relaxation behavior completely .",
    "it is also important to know how the random heteropolymer or protein can make transitions between different energy levels corresponding to different polymer configurations .",
    "if such transitions are possible , one says that the levels are connected and the numerical values of the transition rates will determine the ease of transition .",
    "however , due to the microscopic origin of the connectedness and the transition rules , it becomes difficult to account for these parameters correctly .",
    "it is therefore a difficulty problem to predict the true asymptotics of a relaxation in these systems .",

    "let s consider the relaxation to equilibrium in the unbiased random energy model@xcite .",
    "here it was believed that the relaxation to equilibrium due to a temperature quench from above to below the freezing temperature follows a two stage kinetics@xcite .",
    "the first stage is characterized by a logarithmic relaxation of the extensive part of the energy , while in the second stage , when the system has already reached its frozen state , the relaxation follows a power law decay .",
    "however it has also been suggested that the relaxation dynamics can be described by a stretched exponential time dependence@xcite , or a single power law decay@xcite . in all these references",
    "a master equation was used to investigate the kinetics of relaxation in the context of the random energy model .",
    "why are there several different predictions for the asymptotics of the relaxational dynamics for the same model ?",
    "the answer is related to the fact that different transition rates used in the master equation can lead to different asymptotics@xcite .",
    "if we define @xmath5 to be a transition rate from the @xmath6-th energy level to the @xmath7-th one , and define @xmath8 , @xmath9 to be the equilibrium probabilities for the two states , then according to detailed balance @xmath10 . in terms of the energies of the @xmath6-th and @xmath7-th levels",

    "indeed , one finds a stretched exponential decay@xcite by choosing @xmath15 , while a power law decay@xcite for @xmath16 ( choosing @xmath16 means that all energy levels have the same activation energy ) .",
    "while the relaxational dynamics by quenching to low temperatures is clearly complicated , one would in the case of high temperatures intuitively expect a single exponential relaxation as can be shown by investigating the high temperature limit using a highly connected random master equation . at @xmath17 ,",
    "detailed balance gives @xmath18 .",
    "assuming that only a fraction @xmath19 of states is connected , a possible choice of the transition rate is @xmath20 with probability @xmath19 and @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 .",
    "a study of the related random master equation leads to the conclusion that its eigenvalue distribution is sharply peaked at @xmath23 with a width of the order of @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of states .",
    "this means that there is a dominant time scale which is approximately given by @xmath26 , leading to single exponential decay at the high temperature region@xcite .",
    "since the random energy model and a highly connected random master equation are related to the problem of protein folding ( both approaches are combined in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we arrive at the following picture for the behavior of the relaxational dynamics of proteins . at high temperatures ,",
    "relaxation is described by a single exponential decay . upon quenching from an unfolded state to equilibrium with a final temperature of the order of the freezing temperature",
    ", one might expect a power law , or a stretched exponential decay , while quenching to a temperature below the freezing point may well lead to an extremely slow logarithmic decay .    in the following sections we examine the above physical picture carefully by means of both numerical and analytical methods .",
    "our analysis also provides insight into the crossover in the relaxation from a single exponential form at high temperatures to a non - arrhenius relaxation near the freezing temperature .",
    "our numerical simulations are based on monte carlo dynamics@xcite for a protein model and we fit the data to various possible decay modes . in the theoretical model",
    "we note the analogy between random heteropolymer relaxation and spin glass dynamics , this allows us to construct an analytical model for the protein relaxation .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives the results of numerical simulations for the distinct asymptotic relaxation behavior of the folding process at various temperatures using random sequences with protein - like energetics@xcite .",
    "section iii contains our theoretical analysis where we derive the asymptotics of the relaxation .",
    "finally section iv is reserved for a short summary .",
    "the detailed algebra for the analysis is organized into two appendices .",
    "we simulated the relaxational dynamics of a model protein by focusing on the energy relaxation as a function of the simulation time .",
    "the simulation was carried out using the monte - carlo ( mc ) method on a 3d cubic lattice for a model protein with 27 amino acid residues .",
    "the contact interaction between the residues is described by the model of li , tang and wingreen@xcite . in this model ,",
    "an analysis of the correlations between the elements of the miyazawa - jernigan ( mj ) contact energy matrix@xcite , gave the contact energy of the protein in the following form@xcite , @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are @xmath30 dimensional vectors .",
    "@xmath30 is the number of residues : @xmath31 throughout all our numerical simulations .",
    "the vector @xmath28 describes the geometric shape of the protein and its element @xmath32 is equal to the number of nearest neighbor contacts made by the @xmath6-th residue with other residues , as discussed in ref .",
    "the vector @xmath29 describes the interaction strength of the residues : the @xmath6-th element of @xmath29 corresponds to the strength of the @xmath6-th monomer on the chain .",
    "the values of @xmath33 were found from a fit to the mj matrix in ref .",
    "since there are twenty different amino acid residues , there will be twenty different values of @xmath33 as documented in ref . @xcite .",
    "as the mj matrix was obtained from experimental data , the elements of @xmath29 can be viewed as empirical parameters to our model . to use eq .",
    "( [ eij ] ) , we call two residues nearest neighbors if they are not connected along the chain but are separated by one lattice constant . in our simulation",
    "we fixed the value of @xmath33 in the range of @xmath34 , where a more hydrophobic amino acid residue has a more negative value of @xmath33 .",
    "for example , for the 2d model protein depicted in fig .",
    "( [ 2d - protein ] ) , the first integer above each monomer corresponds to the number of nearest neighbors for that monomer , while the value @xmath33 of that monomer is written in parentheses .",
    "then from eq .",
    "( [ eij ] ) , the total energy of this 2d protein is @xmath35 .",
    "we emphasize again that @xmath28 specifies the geometry of the conformation while @xmath29 specifies its protein sequence .",
    "finally , we comment that in writing down eq.([eij ] ) we have neglected a quadratic term@xcite which gives a small correction to the linear term of eq .",
    "( [ eij ] ) .",
    "however , the relaxational dynamics of the model protein is not substantially affected by this quadratic term .",
    "our simulation considered nine randomly generated protein sequences , _",
    "i.e. _ nine different @xmath29 vectors . for each sequence we generated a set of relaxation curves corresponding to different quenches to different final temperatures and we studied the decay modes by averaging over the data for all nine sequences . the allowed moves for a monomer in the monte carlo simulation were chosen to be the end move , the corner move , and the crankshaft move@xcite .",
    "for a given protein sequence , the initial state of the model protein was chosen to be completely unfolded so that the initial temperature @xmath36 was about four times higher than that of the folding temperature of our model .",
    "after the equilibration of the protein at the high temperature @xmath37 , it was quenched to a set of different final temperatures @xmath38 and the energy relaxation curves were recorded .",
    "every quench @xmath39 consisted of the following operations : a short equilibration of the system at high temperature @xmath37 using @xmath40 mc steps followed by a quench to the final temperature @xmath38 .",
    "the relaxation data was then stored over @xmath41 mc steps . after a relaxation curve",
    "was recorded the same procedure was repeated many times for thermal averages starting from the same initial condition : @xmath42 to @xmath43 quenches were averaged depending on the value of @xmath38 so as to obtain a smooth relaxation curve . finally , we averaged over a set of different initial equilibrium configurations each with the same value of @xmath44 .",
    "typical relaxation curves for a particular sequence and a set of different @xmath38 are presented in fig .",
    "( [ rel_curves ] ) .",
    "all curves show a fast decay immediately after the temperature quench followed by a slow relaxation to the asymptotic regime .",
    "as we were interested in the non - arrhenius relaxation modes , we fitted these relaxation curves by a stretched exponential , a power law and a logarithmic form respectively .",
    "the stretched exponential decay was taken to have the form @xmath45 the power law decay was chosen to be @xmath46 finally , the logarithmic decay mode was fitted by @xmath47 in equations ( [ stretch],[power],[log ] ) , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath19 , and @xmath51 are fitting parameters .",
    "in the following we analyze these fittings .    the fitted value of the stretched exponent @xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) as a function of the final temperature @xmath52 .",
    "this plot is obtained from a particular sequence @xmath29 . in the fit we used the entire range of the relaxation data where @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "( [ rel_curves ] ) ) .",
    "although there are substantial error bars for @xmath19 , its temperature dependence appears to have three different regions . at high @xmath52 ,",
    "the data is consistent with @xmath54 .",
    "this is reasonable since the relaxational dynamics at a high @xmath52 should , as discussed above , be a single exponential decay . for an intermediate range of @xmath52 as shown in fig .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath55 reduces steadily with @xmath52 .",
    "finally at very low temperatures , @xmath56 , @xmath19 has a value close to @xmath57 .",
    "however , such a small value of @xmath19 usually indicates that the decay is actually not in a stretched exponential form but has instead a different relaxational behavior such as a power law .",
    "the result of fitting the relaxation curves to a power law is summarized in fig .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) , where the fitted power @xmath51 is shown as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "the difficulty in fitting to a power law is that a divergence occurs at the quenching time @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "( [ rel_curves ] ) ) .",
    "since we expect the power law decay to be a possible asymptotic of the relaxation , we used the simulation data for the time period of @xmath59 to avoid the divergence . also , as the final temperature @xmath52 increases , the characteristic relaxation time ( parameter @xmath50 ) decreases substantially and it becomes quite difficult to fit the data to a power law accurately .",
    "this is the reason why the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath52 shown on fig .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) is only shown below @xmath60 .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that this dependence in the range @xmath61 is given by roughly a straight line , namely @xmath62 .",
    "extrapolating this line backwards gives @xmath63 .",
    "an important feature of fig .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) is that as @xmath52 is in the range @xmath64 , the relaxation become extremely slow and the power @xmath51 levels off at a small value @xmath65 .",
    "the fact that both the stretched exponent @xmath19 and the power law @xmath51 change their behavior at nearly the same value of @xmath66 ) signals that a transition to a frozen state occurs near this temperature .",
    "we attempted to fit the relaxation data for the low temperature range @xmath67 with a logarithmic decay .",
    "an almost perfect fit was found for all the sequences at @xmath68 , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ log1 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath69 .",
    "we believe that the logarithmic decay mode sets in near the freezing temperature as demonstrated by the random energy model@xcite .",
    "we thus denote this special temperature scale to be @xmath70 : @xmath71 .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath70 in the rest of this paper as it is reminiscent of a glass transition temperature .",
    "note that the nature of glass transition temperature for copolymer systems has been thoroughly examined in ref .",
    "@xcite and we refer interested readers to that article for details concerning the related physics .",
    "our numerical prediction of the occurrence of a low temperature logarithmic decay mode at temperature @xmath72 agrees with the prediction for the random energy model of ref .",
    "in addition , from the theoretical analysis of the random energy model in ref .",
    "@xcite , it follows that the relaxation near @xmath70 should follow a power law decay with a power @xmath73 .",
    "our simulation data presented in fig .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) is consistent with this linear dependence .",
    "on the other hand , we found that fitting the data near the freezing point @xmath70 with a stretched exponential does not produce an exponent @xmath19 lying along the line which would be expected from ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , from our numerical data it still remains unclear whether the asymptotics _ above _",
    "the freezing temperature follows a stretched exponential decay , although it is apparent that the data can be reasonably well fitted by such a stretched exponential .",
    "to understand the simulation data presented in the last section , in the following we make a theoretical analysis of the relaxation based on the model of hierarchically constrained dynamics for glassy system relaxation@xcite .",
    "the conventional arrhenius relaxation is described by a single exponential decay with a time scale @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the physical quantity of interest .",
    "we obtain a more complicated relaxation behavior by assuming a distribution of time scales .",
    "suppose that @xmath77 is a continuous distribution of possible time scales in our system , then , using the notion of parallel relaxation we write for the total relaxation process@xcite @xmath78 this approach is especially attractive in the case where dynamics is modeled by the master equation .",
    "as the master equation is a first order differential equation , the general solution will be a sum of exponential decays with time scales inversely proportion to the eigenvalues @xmath79 of the transition matrix .",
    "a distribution of time scales @xmath77 thus corresponds to the distribution of inverse eigenvalues @xmath80 .    as pointed out by palmer _",
    "al._@xcite , though a description of relaxation by ( [ rel1 ] ) is certainly appealing , the nature of @xmath77 is not _ a priori _ clear . in the dynamics of such complex systems as random polymers or proteins , it is intuitively plausible that @xmath77 should take into account the dynamic constraints : _",
    "e.g. _ monomer @xmath81 can not move until monomer @xmath82 moves out of the way .",
    "@xmath83 may also depend on such factors as ergodicity breaking in a frozen state of the system .",
    "the theory should also involve a hierarchy of degrees of freedom from fast to slow .",
    "for the protein problem , the fastest degrees of freedom could involve single - atom motion , while slower degrees of freedom could involve a diffusion of domains of secondary structure .    the original theory of ref .",
    "@xcite considered a discrete set of levels @xmath84 with the degrees of freedom in level @xmath85 represented by @xmath86 pseudospins @xmath87 .",
    "each spin in the @xmath88th level is only free to change its state if a condition on some spins at level @xmath85 is satisfied , thus providing a hierarchy of constraints .",
    "this is the key idea of the model as shown schematically in fig .",
    "( [ hiera ] ) .",
    "we take the constraint to be that @xmath89 spins in level @xmath85 ( @xmath90 ) attain one particular state out of their @xmath91 possible states .",
    "then the average relaxation times @xmath92 will be related to @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "hence , @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and @xmath97 sets the time scale of the relaxation .",
    "the average relaxation can now be written as follows @xmath98 @xmath99    to apply this theory to protein folding dynamics , we notice that the summation is taken over @xmath100 higher energy levels in eq .",
    "( [ rel2 ] ) since the states corresponding to the higher energy levels ( the unfolded states ) relax very fast because of minimal dynamical constraints .",
    "clearly , as the folding proceeds and the level index @xmath85 decreases , there will be an increased number of dynamical constraints on folding as the protein becomes geometrically more compact . hence the relaxation times for the more folded states should increase in comparison to those of the less folded states .",
    "the meaning of the `` pseudospins '' of ref .",
    "@xcite in our protein problem can be elucidated by noticing the similarity of a spin flip and a local monomer move .",
    "for instance , a crankshaft move , a corner move or an end move in our monte carlo simulation could be compared with a pseudospin flip , while a configuration of spins could represent a protein conformation .",
    "two energetically close protein conformations may differ from each other by a local move of a monomer , similar to the flip of a spin .",
    "it is much easier to make a local move ( a spin flip ) in an unfolded state than in a folded state because of the energetics consideration and the importance of volume exclusion interactions in compact protein conformations .",
    "clearly , the analogy of pseudospin flips to local monomer moves can be extended to more realistic off - lattice protein models .    from the above discussion",
    ", we now make some assumptions about the form of @xmath101 and @xmath86 for the protein problem . first , from the form of eq .",
    "( [ rel2 ] ) one can immediately deduce that @xmath101 should depend upon temperature .",
    "when @xmath102 , the relaxation should be a single exponential , from eq .",
    "( [ rt ] ) we conclude @xmath103 and it should not depend on @xmath85 .",
    "the simplest form for @xmath101 satisfying these conditions is @xmath104 .",
    "as far as @xmath86 is concerned , it should be proportional to the total number of states on each level .",
    "when @xmath102 , all the pseudospins are excited so that @xmath86 in this limit equals to the number of pseudospins on the @xmath85th level . as temperature decreases and the system finally goes into the frozen state , the number of pseudospins on each level should decrease to the order of unity signifying ergodicity breaking in the relaxational dynamics . for our protein problem , in the low temperature limit",
    "the decrease in the number of pseudospins corresponds to the restriction of the dynamical space to a set of specific pathways for protein relaxation . in our model",
    "we choose @xmath86 to depend on temperature in the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 corresponds to the  level freezing \" temperature of ref .",
