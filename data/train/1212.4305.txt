    "synchronization , or injection locking of a self - sustained oscillator to an external periodic signal is a paradigm of nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the target oscillator adjusts itself to the external frequency for strong enough injection or small enough frequency mismatch , with a sharp threshold separating configurations with stable locked steady states from unlocked configuration .",
    "injection locking in cw lasers has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "injection locking is useful to stabilize the target laser versus phase diffusion and frequency drift , and can be achieved for very weak seeding provided the frequency mismatch is small enough . strong injection leads to rich behavior , including bifurcations , multistability , excitability and chaos @xcite .",
    "if the laser is mode locked , and the injected signal is pulsed , the target laser pulse train can injection - lock to the source pulse train . unlike cw synchronization that implies entrainment of a single optical frequency , pulse train synchronization entails entrainment of _ two _ frequencies , namely the pulse repetition rate and the pulse phase shift per round trip . since these two frequency",
    "determine the spacing and offset of the pulse train frequency comb , pulse train synchronization is equivalent to injection locking of the target laser frequency comb to the comb of the source . in this way a very high - quality standard frequency comb source , that can be quite weak , could impart its quality to the target laser , locking it to the standard and reducing imperfections , such as pulse noise and frequency drift .",
    "a natural application is when the source is carrier - envelope phase locked , where injection locking locks the carrier - envelope phase of the target . when the repetition rates of the source and target are not matched but rationally related , synchronization results with a target repetition rate that is the least common multiple of the source and free running target , facilitating generation of high - repetition rate frequency comb @xcite .",
    "compared to cw injection locking , there are few studies of injection locking of mode locked lasers .",
    "the basic theory of the system was developed in @xcite using soliton perturbation theory in the framework of the haus mater equation model .",
    "reference @xcite derived estimates of the locking regime parameters , and studied numerically the pulse dynamics for some typical locked and non - locked parameters . the phenomenon was demonstrated experimentally in actively mode locked lasers in @xcite and in passively mode locked fiber lasers in @xcite .",
    "the effects of noise in injection locked mode locked lasers was studied in @xcite .",
    "the combined effect of noise and injection in the mode locking transition was studied theoretically in @xcite and experimentally in @xcite , showing critical phenomena with classical exponents .",
    "rational injection locking was demonstrated experimentally in passively mode locked lasers in @xcite and in harmonic mode locked lasers in @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the injection locking _ threshold _ phenomenon .",
    "if the envelope of a pulse of the free - running target laser is @xmath0 , its pulse train waveform is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the repetition rate , and @xmath3 is the pulse to pulse overall phase shift . assuming that the source wave form is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the source pulse wave form , the time slip rate @xmath6 and phase slip rate @xmath7 between the source and the target pulse trains measure the mismatch between the source and target frequency combs . since the pulse to pulse phase shift is defined modulo @xmath8 , @xmath7 is defined modulo @xmath9 , while the frequency @xmath6 can take all real values .    in standard single - frequency synchronization",
    "there is a threshold frequency mismatch below which the target is locked . at threshold",
    "the locked state loses stability in a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "here there are two mismatch parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , so for a given @xmath5 there is a domain in the @xmath10 plane of where the target frequency comb is stably injection locked to the source comb . in the locking domain",
    "the target waveform is then @xmath11 where the @xmath12 is the target pulse waveform in the presence of injection .",
    "the shape and area of the locking domain has to be calculated on a case - by - case basis .",
    "here we study soliton mode locking where the free target pulse waveform is non - chirped soliton - like @xmath13 , and the source pulse waveform is @xmath14 so that the injected pulse shape is an attenuated version of the free - running pulse shape ; still , it follows from the analysis below that the locking properties depend weakly on the precise source pulse shape as long as it approximately matches the target pulse .",
    "the parameters of the source pulse are the dimensionless injection strength @xmath15 , frequency @xmath16 and chirp @xmath17 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is usually omitted from the definition of the pulse shape because it can be absorbed into the carrier frequency .",
    "here it has to be spelled out explicitly because the difference between the peak gain frequencies of the source and target pulses is a crucial locking parameter . in most of our analysis",
    "we assume that the injection is weak , @xmath18 .",
    "as shown below , under this assumption the locked steady state and its stability depend only on the ratios @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the main effect of the injection on the target waveform is a shift @xmath21 in its overall timing and a shift @xmath22 in its overall phase relative to the source pulse , so that @xmath23 .",
    "the main results of this work are the locking diagrams shown in figure [ fig : ld ] for several values of pairs @xmath24 .",
    "the boundaries of the locking domains are shown in black .",
    "in addition to the threshold , the locking diagrams also show the @xmath21 and @xmath22 level curves . interestingly , although in general the locking domains are smaller for larger @xmath25 and @xmath26 due to decreasing source - target pulse overlap , the shrinking is not uniform , and locking with some mismatch parameters is possible only for nonzero relative frequency or chirp . when @xmath27 there is a correlation between the timing and phase frequency mismatches , where for some @xmath28 values there is a minimal @xmath6 needed for synchronization and vice versa .",
    "our analysis is based on the haus theory of anomalous dispersion passively mode - locked lasers with a fast saturable absorber @xcite , also called mode locked soliton lasers @xcite .",
    "the haus master equation is a multiple scale model of the electric field envelope @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fast sub - roundtrip time scale , and @xmath31 is the slow time scale describing the evolution of the wave form for an integer multiple of the roundtrip time @xmath2 .    using the gain band center as the reference frequency the equation of motion for the free target laser is @xmath32\\left(1+\\gamma\\partial_t^2\\right ) \\psi+ \\sigma(|\\psi|^2)\\psi\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the overall gain , assumed to depend on the pulse energy @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the coefficient of parabolic spectral gain profile , and @xmath36 is the transmissivity of the saturable absorber , including linear loss equal to @xmath37 .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : master ] ) model the anomalous dispersion and kerr nonlinearity , with coefficients fixed by appropriate choice of units .",
    "the conversion of the results to physical units and their implication for practical systems are discussed below .",
    "since the haus master equation describes the evolution of the pulse waveform between consecutive roundtrip periods , the optical injection can be modeled by an inhomogeneous seed term @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the envelope of the seed pulse waveform ( in appropriate units ) injected in the @xmath40th roundtrip in the frame defined by equation ( [ eq : master ] ) . for the source waveform ( [ eq :",
    "so ] ) the injection locking master equation is therefore @xmath41 the injection locking master equation that was first derived in @xcite is equivalent to equation ( [ eq : master - inj ] ) .",
    "the master equation was written in @xcite in the frame of reference where the injected signal is exactly periodic , and therefore contains an additional term in the master equation that arises from a frequency shift of the source waveform , that is accounted here by the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the target waveform approaches an injection locked pulse train ( [ eq : il ] ) if there is a stable solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master - inj ] ) of the form @xmath42 .",
    "an unlocked solution typically consists of two pulses , a strong pulse of free target waveform weakly perturbed by interaction with the seed , and a weak response waveform that is approximately a linearly filtered version of the seed pulse .",
    "the unlocked state is not stationary in any frame .",
    "in soliton mode locking we assume that the gain , loss and injection terms in the equation are small .",
    "then the target laser waveform has a perturbed soliton component @xmath43 where @xmath44 in addition to the strong pulse ,",
    "the solution of the master equation ( [ eq : master - inj ] ) includes a weak continuum component , as well as a response pulse if the target fails to lock to the source .",
    "we are interested in the soliton - like pulse component ( [ eq : psol ] ) whose properties govern the frequency comb locking .",
    "the slow time dynamics of the pulse parameters , amplitude @xmath45 , phase @xmath46 , frequency @xmath47 , and timing @xmath48 is obtained by projection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master - inj ] ) on the four nls adjoint eigenfunctions @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xcite that gives @xmath51 where # 1 @xmath52                the seed and target are synchronized if the seed - target phase mismatch @xmath53 and timing mismatch @xmath54 are locked .",
    "it follows that a locked state is a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dta][eq : dts ] ) with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the seed projections depend on the mismatches so that the injection problem reduces in this regime to the solution of four coupled nonlinear equations for the unknowns @xmath58 given the mismatch parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    the free - running version of equations ( [ eq : dta][eq : dts ] )",
    "describes mode locked soliton - like pulses with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the solution of @xmath62 with free overall phase accumulation rate @xmath63 .",
    "the question of synchronization is most interesting when the injected signal is weak and the mismatches are small . here",
    "weak injection means that the injected signal is weaker than the intrinsic target laser gain and loss effects ( themselves weaker than the the dispersive effects ) so that the pulse width and frequency are only slightly shifted from their free running values , that is @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this case",
    "it is natural use units such that @xmath66 , so that the locking equations become non - dimensional and linear in @xmath67 and @xmath47 @xmath68 where @xmath69 , necessarily positive for pulse stability , and @xmath70 .",
    "the smallness assumptions used to derive eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dtringa][eq : dtdelta ] ) imply that @xmath71 .",
    "our goal is to map the set of stable injection - locked steady states . in the steady state equations  ( [ eq :",
    "dtringa][eq : dtdelta ] ) can be further simplified since the direct forcing terms in the phase and timing equations of motion are smaller than the indirect forcing via the amplitude and frequency , as a consequence of a general property of soliton perturbation theory .",
    "specifically , it follows from equations  ( [ eq : dtringa],[eq : dtp ] ) that @xmath72 , and therefore the forcing term in equation ( [ eq : dtdelta ] ) is negligible ; the term @xmath73 is negligible in equation ( [ eq : dtdelta ] ) for analogous reasons .    by the preceding arguments ,",
    "given the injection waveform and the timing and phase mismatches , a locked steady state is a solution @xmath74 of the coupled nonlinear equations @xmath75 where @xmath76 displaying explicitly the forcing strength coefficient @xmath15 of the source waveform . the solution is stable if the eigenvalues of the matrix ( omitting zero elements for clarity ) @xmath77 have negative real parts .",
    "the results derived so far hold for weak injection with an arbitrary pulse shape .",
    "the precise locking properties depend on the details of the pulse shape through the forcing functions @xmath78 ; nevertheless , since the forcing functions are defined by overlap intervals , their values are of @xmath79 for a source pulse shape that matches the free target pulse shape in width and frequency , and is not excessively chirped .",
    "we therefore choose the form ( [ eq : as ] ) , allowing for mismatch @xmath16 in center frequency and @xmath17 in chirp between source and target .",
    "unlike the comb mismatch parameters @xmath7 and @xmath6 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are pulse parameters whose values are not fixed by the locking dynamics .",
    "we further comment below on the different roles played by these two pairs of parameters .",
    "the solution of the injection locking problem is presented in figure [ fig : ld ] as a set of locking diagrams for different choices of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , that display the regions in parameter space where synchronization is stable . in all cases there",
    "is a stable locked state when @xmath80 , while for large @xmath28 or @xmath6 there are no stable locked states .",
    "frequency comb locking is made easier by stronger injection , and hindered by stronger restoring coefficients , so that the mismatches are multiplied by the restoring coefficients ( @xmath7 by @xmath81 and @xmath6 by @xmath82 ) and divided by @xmath15 in the locking diagrams ; the physical implications of the scaling are analyzed in the conclusions section below .",
    "the locked and non - locked regions in the @xmath28-@xmath6 plane are separated by a curve where at least one the eigenvalues of @xmath83 is zero , shown in black in the locking diagrams .",
    "it follows that at the locking boundary point the jacobian matrix @xmath84 is singular , so that at generic boundary points there is a saddle - node bifurcation , where stable locked solutions connect with unstable locked solutions on reaching the locking domain boundary from the interior .",
    "it also follows that the constant @xmath21 and constant @xmath22 curves , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ld ] in green and orange hues ( respectively ) meet the boundary tangentially .    in the non - chirped locking diagrams the @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "are mapped to corners on the locking domain boundary , since the jacobian vanishes there identically .",
    "the corners are not structurally stable , and when the source is chirped one of the corners becomes smooth and the other a cusp .",
    "the boundary of a typical locking diagram is therefore smooth except for one cusp .",
    "the most evident conclusions from the locking diagrams is that the locking region shrinks with both increasing frequency mismatch and increasing chirp .",
    "this results is to be expected since the overlap of the source and target pulses decreases when there is relative frequency or chirp , and the injection efficiency decreases .",
    "when @xmath16 and @xmath17 become large the area of the locking domain decreases fast to zero  as a power law for large @xmath17 , and exponentially for large @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , the shrinking is not monotonic , and some areas of the @xmath28-@xmath6 plain are more susceptible to locking with moderate frequency mismatch and/or moderate chirp , see figure [ fig : nm ] .",
    "this is made possible by adjustment of the locked phase shifts @xmath21 and @xmath22 to compensate for greater mismatches . for non - zero @xmath16",
    "the source waveform has a time - reversal odd component , so that the values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 become closer , and the admissible @xmath28 and @xmath6 intervals become correlated ; the correlation becomes more pronounced for larger frequency mismatch .",
    "the locking diagrams display some discrete symmetries .",
    "first , for any locked state @xmath89 with shifts @xmath90 , there is an opposite solution @xmath91 with shifts @xmath92 ; at most one of these solutions is stable . for a time - reversal even source envelope",
    "the following identities hold @xmath93 it follows that the locking diagrams for all @xmath24 values are determined by those with both non - negative : the locking diagram for @xmath94 is obtained from that of @xmath24 , by horizontal reflection and replacement of @xmath90 by @xmath95 , and the diagram for @xmath96 is obtained from that of @xmath24 by a @xmath97 rotation around the origin and replacement of @xmath90 by @xmath98 . in particular",
    ", the locking boundaries of the @xmath99 diagrams are symmetric with respect to a half turn around the origin , and those of the @xmath100 diagrams are symmetric with respect to horizontal reflection .",
    "boundary of locking region for @xmath101 ( black ) , @xmath102 ( green ) , and @xmath103 ( blue ) .",
    "it is evident that moderate source chirp and source - target frequency shift improves locking properties for some comb mismatch values .",
    "the axes are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ld ] , width=264 ]",
    "the main result of this work is a precise mapping of the locking of a passive mode locked laser frequency comb to that of an external pulse train .",
    "we focused on the weak injection regime where this effect is most striking .",
    "in contrast with cw synchronization , frequency combs are specified by two frequencies , that have to be locked together , making the locking problem two - dimensional .",
    "the difference between the two combs was parametrized by the mismatch @xmath7 between the comb offsets and the mismatch @xmath6 between the comb spacings .",
    "the mismatches should be comparable or smaller to the forcing strength @xmath15 divided by the restoring coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( respectively ) of the target laser dynamics .",
    "the locking diagrams show the synchronization behavior using dimensionless quantities : @xmath6 is expressed as multiples of @xmath61 , the inverse of the free target pulse width , and @xmath7 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 as multiples of the dispersion frequency  the dispersion coefficient @xmath17 times @xmath104 times the group velocity  that is typically much slower than @xmath61 .",
    "the injection - restoration ratios @xmath105 , @xmath106 are a measure of the strength of the injection , here assumed small . for weak injection therefore , the repetition rate of the source and the target should be matched up to a fraction of the pulse bandwidth , and the offset frequencies have to be matched up to a fraction of the slow frequency unit . if @xmath15 is increased , the locking domain becomes larger proportionately , until the forcing is no longer weak , when nonlinear effects not studied here may prevent further growth of the locking domain .",
    "practically , the laser repetition rates can be tuned by changing the cavity length , and the pulse bandwidth makes the admissible @xmath6 interval large enough for passive control . on the other hand ,",
    "the natural frequency scale of the offset mismatch @xmath7 is much smaller , and the @xmath7 tolerance is accordingly more limited . to understand the locking of pulse phase it should be recalled that @xmath7 is actually defined modulo @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the repetition rate , so that a physical @xmath7 corresponds to a horizontal lattice in the locking diagrams . if @xmath7 takes a random value between @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( say ) , there is a high probability of locking if the lattice spacing @xmath107 is of the order of or smaller than the range of offset mismatched in the diagram , and low probability otherwise . in fiber lasers with @xmath111 pulses and standard fiber dispersion",
    "the slow frequency scale is about @xmath112much smaller than normal repetition rates of about @xmath113 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to obtain small enough @xmath7 by passive control , and for this reason a sophisticated active stabilization of @xmath7 was implemented in @xcite to achieve synchronization .",
    "the amplitude and frequency restoring coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 are hard to measure directly .",
    "@xmath81 can be estimated by the relaxation rate of the gain medium , which can vary by many orders of magnitude between @xmath114 in erbium and @xmath115 in diode lasers .",
    "@xmath82 is equal to the product of the overall differential gain @xmath33 and the gain bandwidth attenuation factor @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath33 can be estimated from cw operation where it typically varies between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , while @xmath35 is inversely proportional to the square of the bandwidth so that @xmath116 varies from about @xmath119 for highly chirped pulses to 1 for bandwidth limited pulses .",
    "weaker restoring coefficients allow for larger pulling of @xmath45 and @xmath47 from their free - running values , and therefore the @xmath7 locking interval is larger for slow gain media and the @xmath6 locking interval is larger for slower differential gain and larger gain bandwidth .",
    "an important conclusion from this discussion is that the locking properties depend strongly on the pulse duration and the group velocity dispersion . for fixed injection efficiency @xmath15 and restoring coefficients",
    ", the admissible @xmath7 interval is proportional to @xmath120 and the admissible @xmath6 interval is proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "it follows that injection locking is particularly well - suited for high dispersion ultrafast lasers .    unlike the mismatch of comb parameters that acts as a barrier to synchronization",
    ", the matching of source and target pulse shapes affects the locking properties through the overlap integrals in equations ( [ eq : fnu][eq : fu ] ) .",
    "it follows that the most relevant are the matching of the central frequency , chirp , and width of the pulses . of these , the locking is most sensitive to frequency mismatch , since the overlap integrals drop sharply when the bands of the source and target do not match .",
    "a subtler effect is the deformation of the locking domain to an elongated shape , so that there is an ` easy ' direction in the @xmath7-@xmath6 plane where relatively large mismatches allow injection , which is not possible with comparable mismatches in other directions . in practice",
    "the frequencies are naturally matched if the two lasers use the same gain mechanism .",
    "the effect of relative chirp is to decrease the effective source bandwidth available for locking , so the area of the locking domain shrinks more slowly for large chirp than as for large frequency mismatch .",
    "the example of chirp also highlights the difference between the role of comb parameter and pulse parameter matching . whereas for a given chirp there is always an area of the @xmath7-@xmath6 plane that allows locking , no choice of pulse shapes lead to synchronization if the offset frequency mismatch @xmath7 is significantly larger than @xmath122 in natural units .",
    "these conclusions are in agreement with the experimental achievement of injection locking by tuning the chirp of the source pulse in @xcite .",
    "we did not study in detail the effect of pulse - width mismatch between source target , but the effect is likely to be similar to that of chirp , as a gradual shrinking of the area of the locking domain , but without the breaking of the discrete symmetries .",
    "the study of the effect of noise which is liable to change some qualitative properties @xcite is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the results derived here have natural implication in threshold phenomena in rational pulse injection locking and the resulting repetition rate multiplication that need to be studied separately .    _",
