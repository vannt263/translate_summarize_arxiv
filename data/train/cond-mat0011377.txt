    "the @xmath3(111 ) surface does not melt , whereas @xmath3(100 ) exhibits incomplete melting .",

    "x - ray reflectivity measurements were used for high - temperature studies of the @xmath4 face of caprolactam ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "initially a series of layering transition followed by prewetting was suggested , but later a surface hydration mechanism was proposed for temperature disordering of this surface .",
    "chernov and yakovlev studied surface melting for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 faces of biphenyl ( @xmath10 ) using the ellipsometry technique @xcite .",

    "it was proposed that surface melting observed by chernov and yakovlev is induced by the roughness of the glass used in their ellipsometry experiment @xcite .",

    "dzyaloshinskii , lifshitz , and pitaevskii developed the theory of long - range dispersion interaction between macroscopic bodies @xcite .",
    "the van der waals interaction between interfaces is a consequence of electromagnetic fluctuations in a polarizable medium and the discontinuity of the dielectric function across the boundaries . in the dlp theory",
    "the force between interfaces ( such as those shown in fig .",

    "( 8) is suitable for minimization . in principle , the most important factor in the minimization process is the quality of experimental data , i.e. , the number of points and their distribution . it is known that the main contribution belongs to data in the uv region of the spectra @xcite .",
    "the uv part of the spectrum for @xmath1 is represented with many points @xcite .",
