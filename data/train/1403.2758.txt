    "ultraluminous x - ray sources - extremely bright x - ray sources with bolometric luminosities exceeding the eddington limit for a 20m@xmath1 object - continue to puzzle astronomers . due to their distance , located in external galaxies ,",
    "it is difficult to identify optical counterparts , even with the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "indeed very few objects have been detected in the optical with high confidence @xmath2*this is compared with the hundreds detected in the x - rays*. in addition , only three objects have established optical periods that have been measured : m82 @xcite , for ngc  1313 x-2 @xcite and ngc  5408 x-1 @xcite .    *",
    "multiple authors have shown that ulxs are associated with star formation in their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "* indeed such a correlation has been observed for high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) in our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an average offset of @xmath0400  pc between galactic hmxbs and nearby sfrs ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many authors have found evidence that ulxs are generally associated with large clusters and that the ulx is nearby these clusters .",
    "for instance @xcite found that in starburst galaxies , x - ray sources are , in general , located near star clusters but also that x - ray sources with luminosities @xmath3  10@xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 tend to be even closer to clusters .",
    "similar results were found by @xcite in the starburst galaxy ngc  4449 .",
    "eleven x - ray binaries were found to be located nearby or inside very young clusters . in the antennae galaxy ,",
    "10 out of 14 ulxs seem to be associated with young stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite found 7 ulxs associated with clusters in the antennae galaxy using infrared images .",
    "these authors found that , in general , x - ray sources tend to be close to large clusters ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite used photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey to look for possible associations of 47 ulxs with sfrs or young superclusters .",
    "they found that statistically ulxs are indeed associated with recent star formation ( within 100  pc distance ) , but no superclusters were detected given the poor spatial resolution of the instrument .",
    "@xcite performed spectral and photometric analyses of clusters associated with the antennae ulxs and found that almost all are very young ( 2.4 to 3.2 myr ) , and that only one resides inside a cluster ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .originally m82 x-1 was thought to be located inside a supercluster , until @xcite showed that it is actually offset from the cluster .",
    "however , in the same paper , the authors found that a ulx in ngc  7479 was associated with a young supercluster , so such objects are known to exist .",
    "* in theory the location of a ulx in relation to its surrounding star clusters can tell something about the environment in which the black hole was born as well as constrain some of the properties of the black hole .",
    "for instance , if a small black hole is born in a cluster of stars , the initial explosion can be asymmetric enough to kick the black hole out of the cluster .",
    "this is known as the runaway binary scenario @xcite .",
    "this theoretical scenario does not work for larger black holes , such as intermediate black holes ( imbh * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since a ) the black hole is too big to be susceptible to such kicks and b ) even if such a black hole were kicked it would return to the cluster on very short timescales because of gravitational pull ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e. v@xmath6 @xmath7 v@xmath8 ) . however , there are ways to kick intermediate black holes out of clusters using 3-body interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario the intermediate mass black hole and",
    "donor star can be kicked out of the cluster by another young massive interloper star .",
    "assuming this theory is correct , we would expect to find most potential intermediate mass black holes inside young , dense clusters of stars .",
    "such , an environment would also readily explain the growth of an intermediate mass black hole through stellar collisions with the stars in the parent cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in summary , all of this information can be combined to estimate characteristics of the ulx including the age and mass of a stellar companion assuming the black hole originated in a nearby cluster of stars or parent cluster @xcite .",
    "*    the observational evidence for a possible association between ulxs and the star - formation in the galaxy is still controversial .",
    "some starburst galaxies such as the antennae galaxy , the cartwheel galaxy and m82 contain an unusually large number of very bright ulxs . on the other hand , there are many star - forming galaxies without any known ulxs .",
    "in addition there are dwarf galaxies ( such as holmberg  ii and holmberg  ix ) and even some ellipticals that contain bright ulxs . the ulxs found in elliptical galaxies seem to be fainter",
    ". some of the bright ulxs that appear may actually be interlopers @xcite .",
    "interestingly , most of the galaxies mentioned here ( antennae , cartwheel , m82 , holmberg ii , and holmberg ix ) are either merging or interacting with other galaxies .",
    "more recent examples are the colliding galaxy pair ngc  2207/ic  2163 where 21 ulxs were detected @xcite , arp  147 with 9 ulxs @xcite , and ngc  922 with 12 ulxs @xcite .",
    "the latter two are drop - through ring galaxies , similar to the carthwheel .    in this paper",
    "we use _ xmm - newton _ archival images taken with the optical monitor ( om ) to explore ulx environments in nearby galaxies . ultraviolet ( uv ) emission is well suited to study star - forming regions ( sfrs ) and young clusters around ulxs .",
    "the ulx sample presented here was extracted from the xmm sources analyzed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , wmr ) .",
    "we selected all the ulxs with unabsorbed luminosities l@xmath9  @xmath10  2.7@xmath1110@xmath12  erg  s@xmath5 , as estimated by the authors .",
    "this limit corresponds to a 20  m@xmath13 black hole radiating at the eddington limit .",
    "our ulx sample consists of all the sources for which om uv data was found in the archives .",
    "we added to this sample the ulx associated with the mf16 nebula in ngc  6946 as a standard , since it is well - studied in the literature .",
    "the original ulx sample in wmr was selected from galaxies closer than 8  mpc .",
    "the goal was first to examine whether ulxs are located inside clusters or sfrs or are possibly related to nearby such regions .",
    "second was to use photometry to impose constraints on the nature of the optical companions and the accretion mechanism of the ulx .",
    "we measured fluxes for 100  pc regions at ulx positions and for bright sources ( sfrs ) detected nearby .",
    "section  2 describes the data found in the archives and the photometry procedure .",
    "we present the photometry results for the 100  pc region centered on ulxs in section  3 .",
    "the results for the sfrs found close to ulxs are presented in section  4 , together with the population synthesis modeling used to estimate ages and masses .",
    "these are used in section  5 to test runaway binary scenarios .",
    "finally , in sections  6 and 7 we discuss our results and present the main conclusions .",
    "om is a 30-cm optical / uv instrument co - aligned with the x - ray instrument on the _ xmm - newton _ telescope .",
    "the om includes three optical and three uv filters : v , b , u , uvw1 , uvm2 , and uvw2 , with effective wavelengths of 5430 , 4500 , 3440 , 2910 , 2310 , and 2120 , respectively .",
    "the om instrument has a smaller field of view than the x - ray instrument , but was not used by default in all observations .",
    "we found 26 out of 36 ulxs from wmr that had been observed by the om and which met our criteria for selection ( ulx is defined as any object with l@xmath9  @xmath10  2.7@xmath1110@xmath12  erg  s@xmath5 , see section 1 for details ) .",
    "we also included the ulx in ngc  6946 as a reference object , because it is well studied in the literature .",
    "all 27 objects are located in 16 nearby galaxies .",
    "we found a total of 36 useful om observations of these galaxies in the archives as of 2012 jun 25 ( meaning that some ulxs have more than one observation ) .",
    "these are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the ulxs were observed with a diverse set of filters .",
    "most ulxs were not observed with all of the filters , however .",
    "we discarded images with artifacts like `` ghost images '' .",
    "however , with the exception of ngc 4736 xmm1 and ngc 5408 xmm1 , all ulxs have images with the most sensitive of the uv filters , uvw1 . for the large majority of ulxs we found images in at least three filters , allowing the construction of color - color plots .",
    "when redundant images were available we used those images without artifacts and with longer exposures .",
    "we used the `` sky images , '' which are processed images created by the om pipeline .",
    "we used the _ ximage _ software included in the _",
    "heasoft v6.12 _ package to measure the count rates in each filter .",
    "we converted the count rates into flux values using the count rate to flux conversion factors listed in the _ xmm - newton science analysis system users guide_. we applied the coincidence - loss and dead - time corrections on each pixel of the extended source , following the procedure described in the _ xmm - newton users handbook_.    * * ulx 100  pc regions : * to do the astrometry , all of the om images were taken from @xcite , who derive coordinates for each image based on the usno - b1 catalog which is tied to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) .",
    "@xcite estimates the errors on these positions to be 0.3@xmath14 .",
    "when an optical counterpart was observed , small shifts in the images were made to align the om and _ chandra _ images further , thereby deriving the absolute position of the ulx to less than the 0.3@xmath14 accuracy of the @xcite images . *    for each source , we created regions centered on the ulx position with diameters of 100  pc , assuming the distances listed in table  1 of wmr ( two examples are shown in figure  [ images ] ) .",
    "the 100  pc regions translate into angular sizes ranging from 2.6@xmath14 to 6.6@xmath14 .",
    "the 100  pc regions are the smallest possible regions that could be extracted for photometry since the fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) for the om instrument ranges from 1.5@xmath14 to 2.0@xmath14 .",
    "the only exception to the 100  pc extraction region was ic  342 xmm3 which is located inside a very uv - bright nuclear cluster . for this ulx",
    "we used a region of 265  pc diameter instead of 100  pc , in order to include the extended emission .    * * surrounding star forming regions : * for each",
    "ulx we also measured fluxes from nearby sfrs , using circular or elliptical apertures ( of varying sizes , with offsets up to 1  kpc from each ulx ) .",
    "the number of these regions , their sizes , and offset distances vary for each object .",
    "for most ulxs we measured fluxes for 3@xmath25 nearby sfrs ( see figure  [ images ] for two examples ) . in general",
    ", they are large star - forming regions with diameters of up to 500  pc . the regions are almost always brighter than the 100  pc regions around the ulx and the fluxes measured are more accurate as a result .",
    "aligning the sources between filters is straight forward , since there are multiple stellar sources with which to do the relative astrometry between filters .",
    "*    * * errors and corrections : * most of the uv light from the ulxs is extended ( i.e. not a point source ) and most of the emission is very faint .",
    "because of this , the resultant flux from the 100  pc regions could include multiple sources rather than a single source that could easily be fit with the om point source extraction software .",
    "this leads to confusion in the measurement for the 100pc region around the ulx . *",
    "additional errors are introduced through aperture effects for both the ulx 100pc regions and the chosen star forming regions .",
    "these effects result from using the same - sized apertures for each extraction region across all wavebands .",
    "these color - based aperture corrections are complicated by the extended emission ( i.e. that the emission is not from a point source ) .",
    "indeed the needed corrections are higher for colors calculated between the optical and the uv filters , since the point spread functions ( psfs ) between these filters are different .    in figure  [ psf ]",
    "we calculate the theoretical color offsets obtained when using apertures of the same sizes .",
    "we use the latest psf calibration files available from om .",
    "the photometry for om is calibrated for extraction apertures with radii of 12 and 35 pixels , for the optical and uv , respectively .",
    "the om psfs vary with source brightness or , in other words , the ratio of the count rate to frame rate .",
    "the fwhm decreases with source brightness , and therefore the offsets for the plotted u - uvw1 color also decrease .",
    "the offsets between optical and uv filters are similar , as illustrated by the b - uvw1 color in red ( compared with u - uvw1 ) .",
    "the color offsets between the various optical filters are very small because the psfs are quite similar , however there is a slight offset between the uvw1 and uvw2 filters , which is much smaller than the optical to uv offsets , but which is large enough to warrant correction ( blue lines ) .",
    "based on the theoretical results shown in figure  [ psf ] , we introduced color corrections .",
    "however we note that , since practically all of the sources in this paper are extended , the correction is approximate .",
    "we corrected the measured colors between the optical and uv filters ( u - uvw1 and b - uvw1 ) by interpolating on the source flux up to @xmath20.15 mag for faint sources ( see also figure  [ psf ] ) .",
    "for the uvw1 - uvw2 color , we used a maximum offset of 0.06 mag for faint sources , scaling to zero for the bright sources .",
    "we found that these corrections give consistent estimates for the cluster ages when other colors are available to make the same calculation ( e.g. m101 which has been observed in all filters ) .",
    "in general these corrections are not large and are in fact approximately the same size as the measurement errors on the original magnitudes .",
    "all extraction regions ( both 100  pc ulx regions and sfrs ) were background corrected .",
    "the background was measured by extracting fluxes from nearby areas that were free of visible point sources .",
    "the color excess values e(b - v ) for the milky way extinction were obtained from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "both galactic and extragalactic extinctions were calculated using the extinction curves from @xcite , assuming r@xmath15  3.1 . * all photometric magnitudes presented were corrected using galactic extinctions and the intrinsic extinctions obtained from the color - color models presented in section  4 . *",
    "in this section we use the fluxes measured from the 100  pc regions around the ulx to check for possible uv counterparts . these could be single stars ( the companions in the ulx binaries ) , small ob associations or larger star - forming regions ( clusters ) . an important contribution to the optical or uv flux",
    "could also come from the accretion disk .",
    "we first use the uvw1 fluxes to make general estimates for the different possible counterparts . then",
    ", where available , we use the colors in different om bands to compare with models of standard stars and accretion disks .",
    "the uvw1 is the most sensitive of the uv filters and most of our ulxs have images taken with this filter .",
    "ngc 4736 xmm1 and ngc 5408 xmm1 have no images in the uvw1 band . for these ulxs",
    "we used the u and uvm2 band , respectively . * for ulxs with multiple observations we used the error - weighted average .",
    "based on the _ xmm - newton users handbook _ , we estimate the detection limit for a o5 v star to be @xmath018.8 mag in the uvw1 filter .",
    "this means an individual o5 v star will be detected to about 2.4  mpc with the uvw1 filter if the exposure time is 1000  s. our ability to measure single stars around ulxs is difficult because the brightness of these stars is very close to the detection limit of the uvw1 filter , though the average exposure time is longer ( 3000  s ) . * the magnitudes provided in table  [ table2 ]",
    "should therefore be treated as upper limits .",
    "the measured uvw1 magnitudes are later used to estimate the nature of the uv emission ( i.e. whether the flux is consistent with values expected from a single star , multiple stars , or accretion emission ) .      * in column  11 of table  [ table2 ] , we list the estimated stellar type based on the uvw1 magnitudes , thereby assuming that all the flux within the 100  pc region is emitted by a single star . given the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios in column  9 of table  [ table2 ] ( we take s / n  @xmath3  3 for a detection ) , we estimate that 7 ulxs _ may _ have single stars as counterparts . * an additional two ulxs have no significant detections . for these",
    "we show 3@xmath16 upper limits . in column  12 of table  [ table2 ]",
    "we also show the stellar types for all previously identified optical counterparts in the literature . *",
    "we note that while the absolute magnitude is consistent with that of a single star , the uv emission from these objects are also likely contaminated by accretion disk emission as has been shown in many cases @xcite .",
    "*    * ten of our objects have estimated spectral types for donor stars in the literature .",
    "of these four ulxs ( ngc  1313 xmm3 , ngc  2403 xmm1 , holmberg  ix xmm1 and m101  xmm3 ) have uvw1 spectral - type predictions that are identical or very close to that found in the literature .",
    "* for the other six ulxs which have previous optical counterparts in the literature , the 100  pc uv fluxes suggests multiple stars . in these cases",
    "the ulxs are located inside or very close to small clusters or ob associations and therefore the uv fluxes are likely contaminated by surrounding star formation .",
    "the following outlines background information for ulxs which may suffer contamination :    * ic  342 xmm1 : * ic  342 xmm1 has a f8-g0  ib supergiant as an optical counterpart according to @xcite .",
    "they find no o stars within 300  pc of the ulx , and estimate that for detected stars , the minimum stellar age is 10  myr .",
    "if this star is indeed a g0 , then the absolute magnitude of the star is only @xmath23.1 , and is well below the detection threshold of the uvw1 .",
    "we estimate that the uvw1 flux is equivalent to five o5v stars , but given the previously estimated age , the uv emission is likely produced by several later type stars .    *",
    "holmberg  ii xmm1 : * homberg  ii xmm1 ( hoii  x-1 ) has a 21.5 v - band magnitude stellar counterpart with colors consistent with o stars on the main sequence or b supergiants @xcite .",
    "the ulx is located inside an association of young stars @xcite .",
    "we suspect that here too , the total uvw1 flux is overestimated due to contamination .    * ngc  5204 xmm1 : * ngc  5204 xmm1 ( better known as x-1 ) has a b0  ib supergiant counterpart , based on the si  iii @xmath171299 line @xcite .",
    "the hubble images in @xcite show at least 3 star clusters and ob associations within our 100  pc region ( 4.3@xmath14 ) .",
    "we estimate approximately eight o stars from our uvw1 flux , though here too the flux is likely contaminated .",
    "* ngc  5408 xmm1 : * ngc  5408 xmm1 is also located very close to an ob association . @xcite",
    "estimated its age at 5  myr and also identified a b0 supergiant as the likely ulx counterpart .",
    "several young stars from the ob association fall into our 100  pc extraction region . instead of a single star , we find the uvw1 flux is equivalent to 8 o5v stars .",
    "* * ngc  247 xmm1 : * @xcite used hst observations to show that the ulx is very close to a large and relatively young stellar association .",
    "the stars closest to the ulx are contaminating the uvw1 flux .",
    "the estimate is therefore equivalent to 5 o5v stars . *    * m51  xmm6 : * the ulx is located at the edge of a large sfr , its emission dominates our 100  pc flux .",
    "the measured uvw1 flux is equivalent to 35 o5v stars .",
    "* ngc  6946 xmm1 : * this ulx is associated with the bubble nebula mf16 and a uv point source was identified using hst data by @xcite .",
    "several nearby bright stars and the nebular emission are contaminating our uvw1 flux here as well ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the measured uvw1 flux is equivalent to @xmath0 3 o5v stars .",
    "finally , for three ulxs ( not including the upper limits ) we have no previous published information . for these , even if our estimates are compatible with single stars , the uv images suggest extended star - forming regions , even beyond the 100  pc regions .",
    "the uvw1 emission here is more likely produced by many late - type stars , instead of a single young star , given the spatial information we have .",
    "for 18 ulxs we measured uvw1 fluxes that are too high for single stars , they seem to be located inside small ob associations or sfrs .",
    "for these , column  11 of table  [ table2 ] lists the equivalent number of o5v stars , assuming that all the uvw1 flux inside the 100  pc regions comes from such stars .",
    "two of the most obvious examples are ic  342 xmm3 and ngc  4736 xmm1 .",
    "_ ic  342 xmm3 : _ ic  342 xmm3 is very close to the nucleus of the galaxy . @xcite estimated that it is located 3@xmath14 from the dynamical center of the galaxy . @xcite",
    "measured the nuclear cluster in ic  342 using infrared and optical observations and found a mass @xmath7  6@xmath1110@xmath18  m@xmath1 , and a relatively young age ( 10@xmath19 yr ) , but found no evidence for a supermassive black hole .",
    "if this age estimate is correct , o - stars are too young to be found in the region .",
    "indeed , using the models of @xcite we find o - stars in the number suggested will produce the emission observed in less than 1  myr . by 10@xmath19 years",
    "( the lower limit from * ? ? ? * ) , all of these o - stars would be dead .",
    "* _ ngc  4736 xmm1 : _ for ngc  4736 xmm1 we estimate 747 o5v stars .",
    "the ulx is located inside the face - on spiral galaxy ngc  4736 .",
    "hst images show strong unresolved star formation at the ulx location , and our estimated extinction is also high ( table  [ table3 ] ) . *      in fig .  [ bh ]",
    "we plot the uvw1 magnitudes against the bolometric luminosities for all of the ulxs in our sample ( bolometric luminosities were taken from wmr ) .",
    "the diagonal line in the upper - right corner of this image represents the expected accretion disk emission in the uv as a function of the bolometric magnitude .",
    "this is a theoretical estimate , calculated using a standard disk model for a ulx accreting at the eddington limit @xcite . *",
    "the dotted line represents the emission from an irradiated accretion disk , which is also the maximum contribution to the uv emission we would expect from a disk @xcite . *",
    "the position of this line implies that a significant portion of the measured uv flux is likely from accretion disk emission if the ulx has a bolometric luminosity in excess of 10@xmath20  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "* this is also likely the case for sources appearing close to the theoretical model in the figure , such as ngc  1313 xmm3 and holmberg  ix xmm1 ( see fig .  [ bh ] ) .",
    "interestingly these results are consistent with the findings of @xcite , who suggest , based on optical spectroscopy , that some portion of the uv emission from ngc  1313 xmm3 and holmberg  ix xmm1 comes from a disk component .",
    "we note that these ulxs also show some of the highest x / uvw1 ratios in column  10 of table  [ table2 ] .",
    "*    an even larger fraction of the uv emission would be expected to come from the disk if it were irradiated .",
    "in fact , the uv emission can be increased by up to a factor of 10 for stellar mass bhs as shown in the figure @xcite .",
    "if this is the case for ngc  1313 xmm3 and holberg  ix xmm1 , it would imply that the uvw1 flux is almost entirely from the disk .",
    "we also note that , unlike typical agn , we do not see a trend in x / uvw1 ( where x is a proxy for the bolometric luminosity ) . indeed there is no correlation at all for either single star sources or multi - star sources .    *",
    "while we can not rule out a strictly stellar origin for the ulxs in our sample , it is very likely that a fraction of the uv emission we observe is from the accretion disk .",
    "however as fig .",
    "[ bh ] shows , for most of our sources , the accretion disk is not bright enough to be responsible for _ all _ of the uv emission ( even if it is irradiated ) .",
    "as mentioned previously ( and as table  [ table2 ] , column  11 shows ) most of our sources are bright enough that the emission is likely to be contaminated by multiple stellar sources within the 100  pc aperture , thereby making it impossible to separate the two . in addition , for those sources with stellar estimates , the uv emission is bright enough to come from both the donor star and a disk .",
    "since one of the main goals of this paper is to qualify the environments around the ulx , we feel that the approximate spectral type is very important to understanding the origin and age of the environment from which the ulx was born . again",
    ", this does not mean that some of the total emission does not come from the accretion disk , but that the photometry looks like a specific type of star .",
    "*      * some of the objects in this sample have more than one observation taken in the uvw1 band , however only 4 objects have more than one observation in uvw1 where the source was detected ( many of our objects have multiple observations but the others are non - detections ) .",
    "we therefore looked into the variability of these four objects .",
    "the results of the analysis are shown in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "of the four objects , three ( ic  342 xmm1 , m  101 xmm2 , and ngc  1313 xmm3 ) have only two observations each in uvw1 .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ table4 ] , the two magnitudes observed are the same to within the errors for all three sources .",
    "these objects can therefore be variable only to within this error based on the limited observations available here .",
    "the fourth source however , holmberg  ii xmm1 , is the only source with more than two observations in uvw1 . in this case , the magnitude appears to vary by 0.25 mag . over 8 years .",
    "a @xmath21 test suggests that this source may indeed be variable ( @xmath21 = 102 for 3 degrees of freedom , assuming a constant model ) . *      we performed a color comparison of the 100  pc regions with standard stars .",
    "six color - color plots are presented in figures  [ kurucz1]-[kurucz3 ] . to create the stellar models",
    ", we used the kurucz star library to estimate om colors for stars with solar metallicity .",
    "the fluxes were folded through the latest om response matrices .",
    "@xcite generated an om catalog and found that in general the om colors match the kurucz models well , except for late type stars , where a systematic offset is seen .",
    "we note that not all objects were observed in every filter .",
    "therefore some ulxs appear in some plots and not in others .",
    "if a ulx appears in one plot and not another , this simply means that the ulx was not observed in one or more of the color filters needed for the second plot .",
    "since the accretion disk can have an important contribution to the color emission , we show the theoretical estimates from a standard accretion disk . the uv emission in this case",
    "is described by a power - law with energy index 1/3 for any bh mass .",
    "therefore the uv colors do not change with the bh mass .",
    "they change however when we include self - irradiation of the accretion disk .",
    "we followed @xcite to calculate theoretical spectra from irradiated disks for bh masses up to 10000 m@xmath13 , and then estimated uv colors .",
    "we assumed accretion at the eddington limit .",
    "the theoretical om color tracks are plotted as thick orange lines in figures  [ kurucz1]-[kurucz3 ] .",
    "the errors in the figures are large , especially for the 7 ulxs where the 100  pc flux is compatible with single stars ( not including the upper limits in table  [ table2 ] ) . *",
    "the color information was sufficient to determine spectral type for only 2 sources : ngc4395 xmm1 and m101 xmm2 .",

    "if the donor has an initial mass , m , and a luminosity , l ( ten times the eddington limit ) , we estimate the lifetime for this system by taking the harmonic mean between the lifetime of the donor on the main sequence and the time t  @xmath42mc@xmath43/l , in which the entire mass of the stellar companion is accreted .",
    "these two mass transfer cases are taken as limiting cases .",
    "the transfer can theoretically start at arbitrary times on the main sequence .",
    "however , @xcite point out that there is a minimum delay between the time the binary is ejected and the age of the donor , because the primary evolves inside the cluster before the supernova explosion . the binary must therefore be at least 3  myr old when the system is ejected .",
    "we take this into account when we calculate the offsets by subtracting 3  myr from the donor s remaining lifetime .      using the velocities and lifetimes calculated in this way we can estimate the _ maximum _ offsets from the star - forming regions for different bh and donor masses , and compare them with the measured offsets for our sample .",
    "these calculations are bound by two constraints : the age of the companion and the accretion rate of the system .",
    "the ages of the companion stars are constrained from the starburst99 models and observed om data of the cluster from which they are thought to be born .",

    "the offset is consistent with a bh mass @xmath7700  m@xmath1 for case a and @xmath72000  m@xmath1 for case b ( if it somehow escapes the cluster ) .",
    "* using the x - ray - based bolometric luminosities from wmr ( right panel of figure  [ runaway2 ] ) : * as with the stellar - mass bh scenario , only case a is considered for the bolometric luminosity offset calculation .",
    "just like figure  [ runaway1 ] , the constraint based on the luminosity suggests lower offsets than the one based on the donor mass .",
    "very few of the ulxs located on the left side of the plot have offsets consistent with the bolometric luminosity predictions .",
    "those ulxs that do show some consistency , only correspond to models of accretion close to the eddington limit ( dashed lines ) .",
    "moreover , the bh masses for these ulxs do not exceed 80  m@xmath1 .",
    "again we mark the location of a kick velocity of 10  km  s@xmath5 in the plot by thick black lines . for accretion at 10% of the eddington limit ( continuous lines )",
    "the offsets and ejection velocities are too small to explain the data .",
    "the offset and luminosity for ngc  247 xmm1 are not consistent with a ulx ejected 64  pc from the cluster via three - body interactions .",
    "simulations have shown that in young and dense clusters , imbhs can form through core collapse , the black holes having masses of 0.1%@xmath20.2% of the cluster mass @xcite .",
    "we assume therefore that imbhs can form only in very dense clusters with masses @xmath310@xmath29  m@xmath1 .",
    "one such example was thought to be m82  x-1 .",
    "@xcite found an x - ray position coincident with the cluster mcg  11 , the cluster having a mass of 10@xmath45  m@xmath1 , and a half - light radius of 1.2  pc .",
    "recently , however , @xcite showed that the ulx is actually offset by 16  pc from the super - cluster ( assuming a distance of 5.2  mpc for m82 ) . supporting the dense cluster theory further",
    ", the authors also discovered a new ulx in ngc  7479 , and showed that it is a true example of a imbh located inside a super - cluster with mass in excess of 7@xmath1110@xmath46  m@xmath1 and half - light radius of @xmath020  pc .",
    "two additional ulxs in the antennae galaxy were also shown to be near young super - clusters @xcite .",
    "once the imbh is formed , it still needs to capture a companion star to become a ulx .",
    "@xcite studied the probability of an imbh becoming a ulx using simulations of young ( @xmath7100  myr ) clusters . for dense clusters they found that the probability of capture through binary exchange is relatively high , but that in general the resulting binary would appear as a ulx for only 2% of the total transfer time .",
    "this implies a typical ulx lifetime shorter than 0.1  myr , and a low probability to observe such a ulx .",
    "@xcite considered higher - mass imbhs and found higher probabilities .",
    "their results show that the captured companions are massive main - sequence stars , capable of producing high x - ray luminosities over timescales of @xmath010  myr .",
    "the results in table  [ table2 ] suggest that 18 of the ulxs in our sample are located inside ob associations or sfrs .",
    "there are 3 ulxs which apparently reside inside young sfrs according to the results in table  [ table3 ] ( @xmath710  myr , columns 6@xmath29 ) .",
    "however the cluster masses are not large enough to contain young super - clusters in which imbhs might grow .",
    "the estimates in table  [ table3 ] show that when detection and age estimates were possible , the majority of the stellar populations have ages @xmath4420  myr .",
    "this is true both for the 100  pc regions ( col .",
    "6 ) and the sfrs that contain ulxs ( ulxs in sfrs are in bold in col .  10 ,",
    "corresponding ages are shown in col .",
    "11 ) . in such young regions ,",
    "the donors are likely massive stars .",
    "in addition , super - eddington luminosities can theoretically be achieved with stellar - mass bhs rather than imbhs , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "imbhs can also form in older globular clusters through the much slower mechanism of bh mergers @xcite .",
    "if a larger bh ( @xmath3450  m@xmath1 ) is initially formed in the cluster , it can grow through mergers with smaller black holes .",
    "hardening of binaries through three - body interactions cause the mergers .",
    "the process is thought to be slow and may be inefficient , as many interlopers are ejected .",
    "@xcite built onto this mechanism gravitational radiation and successive mergers of binary and single bhs @xcite , as well as binary - binary interactions . in this case , the host clusters for ulxs should be older clusters ( @xmath3100  myr ) , and the imbh companions later type stars .",
    "only ngc  253 xmm1 seems to be located inside an older stellar population according to our estimates in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "given the resolution of the om instrument , we can not tell if compact clusters are present .",
    "moreover , the uv is not very well suited to detect old stellar populations .",
    "if our ulxs are not apparently located inside super - clusters , they could still have formed in such clusters and later been ejected . as mentioned before , it is difficult with om to identify dense super - clusters inside star - forming regions . however , some of the star - forming regions located nearby ( table  [ table3 ] ) are young and massive enough to host such clusters .",
    "if ulxs are super - eddington sources , they require massive stars as companions ( @xmath34  10  m@xmath1 , type b2 or earlier , see * ? ? ?",
    "we have found that the majority of ulxs ( 17 , see cols .",
    "14 - 17 of table [ table3 ] ) are located nearby sfrs young enough to host such massive stars .",
    "@xcite estimate that in star - forming regions , ulxs can have a typical life of 10 to 30  myr after a starburst , but this lifetime can be as long as 100  myr .",
    "the runaway scenario is normally used as evidence for the stellar - mass bh in ulxs , the argument being that more massive bhs are not easily ejected from clusters .",
    "however , three - body interactions can eject even 1000  m@xmath1 bhs .",
    "in section  5 we have therefore tested runaway scenarios for both stellar - mass bhs and imbhs .",
    "specifically the two scenarios are : 1 ) stellar - mass black hole binaries emitting at ten times the eddington limit ejected by natal kicks , or 2 ) ulxs with imbhs accreting within the eddington limit , ejected by three - body interactions in dense environments .",
    "we have found that the first scenario fits the data much better ( fig .",
    "[ runaway1 ] ) .",
    "however that does not completely rule out some ulxs in this sample as examples of the latter .",
    "the left panel shows that the imbh scenario only works for bh masses up to @xmath0700  m@xmath1 , while in the right panel the offsets can not be explained by this scenario ( assuming case a only ) .",
    "@xcite showed with simulations that massive bhs ( up to 80  m@xmath1 ) can be easily ejected via three - body encounters inside dense clusters , however imbhs have a low probability of being ejected because this requires a high - mass interloper .",
    "finally , another scenario in which ulxs containing imbhs are associated with star - forming regions but not with dense clusters has been proposed by @xcite . an imbh formed in the core of a globular cluster might be released in the galactic disk when the cluster disperses .",
    "if the imbh encounters a molecular cloud , the interaction could precipitate the collapse of the molecular cloud and produce star formation . in the newly formed star cluster",
    "the massive stars would sink towards the center and be captured by the imbh .",
    "this scenario could explain the fact that many ulxs are close to star - forming regions but not to dense stellar clusters .",
    "there are a few problems with the natal kicks scenario .",
    "large kick velocities , as used in this paper , can easily disrupt the binary .",
    "even if it survives , the orbit will become highly eccentric . @xcite and @xcite note that such systems will have an unstable mass transfer if the mass of the donor is larger than the bh .",
    "moreover , the mass - transfer phase is very short , making observing these objects in the ulx phase unlikely .",
    "our assumption that the accretion is super - eddington is not very probable if the donor is a main sequence star with a low mass . @xcite",
    "have shown that even if we assume that the accretion is super - eddington , luminosities @xmath3  10@xmath12  erg  s@xmath5 are only obtained for donors with masses @xmath34  10  m@xmath1 , which supports this assumption .",
    "the natal kick velocities for bhs depend on the amount of fallback associated with the supernova explosion . for lower - mass bhs",
    "the velocities will be lowered with the amount of fallback @xcite .",
    "moreover , kicks are not expected for higher - mass bhs that form without an explosion .",
    "@xcite estimated that the limit on the progenitor mass is @xmath040  m@xmath1 .",
    "newtonian kicks can eject lower - mass imbhs from clusters that are not very dense ( with escape velocities @xmath44  20  km  s@xmath5 , as discussed in section 5.2 ) .",
    "however imbhs can be subject to higher velocity , recoil kicks during bh mergers .",
    "recently , important advances in numerical relativity have allowed precise calculations of the dynamics of bh mergers .",
    "these results show that the asymmetry during the plunge phase of the inspiral can produce `` recoil kicks '' with velocities as high as 4000  km  s@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the kick velocities depend on the mass ratio and spins of the black holes .",
    "the velocities are largest when the bhs are of comparable mass and both have large spins .",
    "these large kicks have very important implications on imbh growth in clusters .",
    "@xcite showed that imbhs with masses @xmath7  500  m@xmath1 are very easily ejected , unless the merging companion bh has a mass @xmath7  10m@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite obtained different results , however .",
    "they found that even a @xmath0  200  m@xmath1 bh can sustain radiative recoil kicks from a merger and never leave the cluster .",
    "this is the same limiting mass that newtonian three - body kicks can eject @xcite .",
    "* @xcite was the first to propose this scenario for the ulx , cxo  j122418.6@xmath47144545 .",
    "*    a slightly different scenario for some ulxs is a recoiling supermassive bh .",
    "@xcite showed that accretion from the interstellar medium in the galactic disk can easily generate luminosities similar to ulxs .",
    "the summary of the main results presented in this paper is as follows :      using uvw1 photometry , we have found that 7 sources with uvw1 magnitudes measured from 100  pc regions have emission that is consistent with a single star ( see also table  [ table2 ] , col .",
    "11 and figure  [ bh ] ) .",
    "indeed for four of these objects our uvw1-predicted spectral types are identical to those found in the literature using other methods .",
    "we note that all of these objects ( even those with consistent published data in the literature ) may be contaminated by or dominated by an accretion disk component . indeed for at least two sources the uv emission likely comes predominantly from an accretion disk ( see also bullet  2 ) .    by comparing the theoretical uv fluxes",
    "expected from accretion disks with the uvw1 measurements , we found that , for most of the ulxs in our sample ( esp .",
    "ngc  1313 xmm3 and holmberg  ix xmm1 ) , a significant part of the measured uv flux could come from accretion disk emission ( fig .",
    "however , even if the accretion disk is at its brightest ( e.g. irradiated ) , it is not bright enough in most cases to be responsible for all of the uv emission . in those cases ( the cases in table  2 , column  11 where the flux is consistent with multiple sources ) ,",
    "it is likely that a star forming region , an accretion disk , and a donor star contaminates the aperture , none of which can be isolated using the uvw1 photometry alone .",
    "we looked at 3 - 5 sfrs around most ulxs .",
    "we derived statistics for the closest sfrs to the ulx , the youngest sfrs around the ulx , and the most massive sfrs around the ulx .",
    "roughly half of the closest sfrs actually overlap with the ulx . of the youngest star forming regions ,",
    "17 out of 21 are less than 10  myr in age , which might imply that young regions are intrinsically related to ulxs .",
    "finally there are also 17 sources with at least one region that is more massive than 10@xmath29 m@xmath13 .",
    "om color - color plots show relatively little reddening for most of the sfrs close to our ulxs , implying that they are likely not imbhs accreting from molecular clouds .",
    "the extinction is also , in general , much less than suggested by the absorption columns obtained from x - ray modeling , indicating that the x - ray absorption is located close to the ulx .",
    "we tested runaway scenarios for both stellar - mass bhs and imbhs .",
    "specifically the two scenarios are : 1 ) stellar - mass black hole binaries emitting at ten times the eddington limit ejected by natal kicks , or 2 ) ulxs with imbhs accreting within the eddington limit , ejected by three - body interactions in dense environments .",
    "we have found that the first scenario fits the data best ( fig .  [ runaway1 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "that does not completely rule out that some ulxs in this sample are imbhs , though the masses we found in this analysis were somewhat small .",
