    "this paper concerns the vlasov - maxwell description of collisionless magnetized plasmas @xcite related to axisymmetric discs arising in the combined gravitational and electromagnetic ( em ) fields of astrophysical compact objects .",
    "in particular , in this work an application of the kinetic theory developed by @xcite is considered , to the treatment of equilibrium and possibly non - neutral equatorial as well as off - equatorial plasma tori . remarkably , the existence of equilibrium levitating ( i.e. , off - equatorial ) structures has been recently pointed out by @xcite , based on a fluid non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) description .",
    "indication of existence of structures of this type occurring in collisionless plasmas is also supported by other recent works based on test - particle approach @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the context of charge - separated pulsar magnetospheres , @xcite found an indication of the possible development of stable off - equatorial tori that can be revealed in his early numerical simulations of magnetized collisionless plasmas .",
    "indeed , from the physical point of view , off - equatorial plasma configurations are intrinsically different from the case of equatorial disc systems . the astrophysical relevance of these structures lies in the possibility of modelling coronal plasmas characterized by low - density and high - temperature conditions @xcite . in this regard , two different issues arise , which deserve a detailed investigation . first , under these conditions fluid descriptions may become inappropriate , requiring in principle the adoption of a kinetic treatment .",
    "however , it still remains to be ascertained whether the levitating structures can be recovered as equilibrium solutions in the framework of a kinetic description .",
    "second , a priori  it is not obvious whether the kinetic theory developed previously for equatorial plasmas can be extended to the description of off - equatorial tori , how this can be achieved in practice and what are the physical implications as far as their occurrence in real systems is concerned .",
    "the statistical description of plasma dynamics can be carried out in terms of either fluid or kinetic treatments , with the choice of the appropriate framework depending on the plasma phenomenology to be addressed and the relevant features of the phenomena to be studied @xcite .",
    "the majority of fluid approaches are based on hydrodynamic or mhd treatments @xcite . in the case of collisionless plasmas , when these are formulated independently of an underlying kinetic theory , some limitations can arise .",
    "first , it is well known that the set of fluid equations may not be closed , requiring in principle the prescription of arbitrary higher - order fluid fields and closure conditions , including in particular the equation of state ( eos ) or the pressure tensor @xcite .",
    "second , in these approaches typically no account is given of microscopic phase - space particle dynamics together with phase - space plasma collective phenomena .",
    "on the other hand , only in the context of kinetic theory these difficulties can be consistently overcome , as this treatment permits to obtain well - defined constitutive equations for the relevant fluid fields describing the plasma state and to solve at the same time the closure problem @xcite .",
    "these issues become relevant in the case of collisionless or weakly - collisional multi - species plasmas subject to em and gravitational fields where phase - space particle dynamics is expected to play a dominant role . in particular ,",
    "kinetic theory is essential for studying both stationary configurations and dynamical evolution of plasmas when kinetic effects are relevant , such as ones associated with conservation of particle adiabatic invariants @xcite , temperature and pressure anisotropies , diamagnetic and finite larmor - radius ( flr ) effects as well as energy - correction contributions @xcite .    the problem of formulating a kinetic theory appropriate for the description of collisionless plasmas in quasi - stationary ( i.e.",
    ", equilibrium)configurations of astrophysical accreting systems and laboratory scenarios has been presented in series of works , based on the non - relativistic vlasov - maxwell description . in our context , several issues have been treated , ranging from laboratory plasmas occurring in tokamak devices @xcite , axisymmetric accretion disc plasmas  characterized by locally - nested magnetic surfaces @xcite and current - carrying magnetic loops @xcite around compact objects as well as spatially non - symmetric systems in astrophysical and laboratory contexts @xcite . it was shown that consistent solutions of the vlasov equation can be determined for the species kinetic distribution function ( kdf ) describing collisionless plasmas , based on the identification of the relevant single - particle invariants .",
    "the equilibrium kdfs were expressed in terms of generalized bi - maxwellian distributions , characterized by temperature anisotropy , non - uniform fluid fields and local plasma flows .",
    "chapman - enskog representations of these equilibria were obtained by developing a suitable perturbative kinetic theory , which in turn made possible the analytical calculation of the fluid fields and the identification of the relevant kinetic effects included in the corresponding mhd description . as a basic consequence , it was shown that these solutions can exhibit non - vanishing current densities which can also support a kinetic dynamo mechanism for the self - generation of em fields in which the plasma is immersed @xcite .",
    "finally , more recently the kinetic theory has been extended to describe axisymmetric plasmas characterized by strong shear - flow and/or supersonic velocities @xcite , while @xcite reports a kinetic analysis of the stability properties of particular equilibrium solutions with respect to axisymmetric em perturbations .",
    "a notable feature of the kinetic equilibria mentioned here is the unique prescription of the functional dependences of an appropriate set of fluid fields , carried by the species kdfs , which are related to physical observables of the system .",
    "these fields are referred to as _ structure functions _ and are denoted as @xmath0 ( see in particular @xcite and the definition below ) , with the subscript s  being the species index .",
    "depending on the kinetic regime being considered , according to the classification scheme presented by @xcite , these dependences are expressed in terms of the poloidal flux function @xmath1 of the magnetic field and/or the effective potential @xmath2 defined as@xmath3where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the gravitational and electrostatic ( es ) potentials respectively , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 denoting the species particle mass and charge .",
    "thus , in the general case kinetic theory requires that @xmath8 .",
    "it must be stressed that , behind the apparent simplicity of the result , for practical applications one ultimately needs obtaining a representation of @xmath9 in terms of spatial coordinates , e.g. cylindrical ones @xmath10 .",
    "assuming an axisymmetric configuration where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are generic functions of both @xmath11 , the representation @xmath12 applies .",
    "hence , the complete solution of the problem actually requires determining the explicit representation of the potentials @xmath13 in terms of the spatial cylindrical coordinates . this can be a very difficult task , since in the general case the plasma itself contributes to the generation of the gravitational filed , through its non - vanishing mass - density , and , more important , of the em fields by means of non - vanishing charge and current densities . in the present discussion we ignore , however , the self - generation of the gravitational field , focusing only on the generation of em fields .",
    "it follows that , in order to obtain explicitly the relationship between the em potentials and the coordinate system , one has necessarily to solve  ( numerically ) the coupled set of vlasov - maxwell equations to determine @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the source terms of the fields are prescribed functions of the potentials . on the other hand",
    ", such a solution is also demanded for the following additional reasons : a ) in order to calculate explicitly the characteristic kinetic effects which enter the equilibrium kdf and are associated with diamagnetic - flr and energy - correction effects ( see @xcite and the discussion in section 7 ) ; b ) in order to establish the diffeomorphism @xmath16 which relates cylindrical ( and similarly , spherical coordinates ) to local magnetic coordinates , where @xmath17 is an angle - like coordinate defined on equipotential magnetic surfaces @xmath18 the complexity of the theory , as far as this issue is concerned , might represent a possible limit for the practical realization of kinetic equilibria of this type for configurations of astrophysical interest .",
    "this may be relevant especially when demanding a comparison between kinetic and fluid treatments based on analytical solutions .",
    "therefore , the question arises of whether such a difficulty can be actually encompassed in some scenarios , possibly by invoking suitable asymptotic kinetic orderings to be imposed on the system .",
    "in particular , this concerns the existence of configurations which allow for the construction of the diffeomorphism @xmath19 based on analytical solutions of the potentials @xmath20 in such a way to afford an explicit treatment of the spatial dependences of the equilibrium fluid fields carried by the kdf according to the constraints posed by the vlasov equation .    a second point of crucial",
    "importance concerns the determination of the eos that characterizes disc plasmas in the collisionless state .",
    "as mentioned above , this is usually realized by prescribing the form of the scalar pressure , or more generally the components of the pressure tensor , which represent the closure condition for the euler momentum equation in mhd treatments . since collisionless plasmas",
    "are intrinsically characterized by the occurrence of phase - space anisotropies which cause the equilibrium kdf to generally deviate from a simple isotropic maxwellian distribution , the knowledge of the correct form of the eos is not a trivial task . in fact , one can only prescribe the pressure tensor in consistent way on the base of the kinetic theory ( kinetic closure conditions ) . in this regard ,",
    "the problem consists in the identification of the kinetic effects which must be included in the pressure tensor , the understanding of their physical origin and the way they influence the macroscopic configuration of the plasma system . among the relevant ones , contributions associated with es corrections",
    "can play a central role , since they arise from microscopic charge interactions and carry information about local es fields generated by the validity of quasi - neutrality condition in rotating plasmas or deviations away from it in non - neutral systems .",
    "finally , from the astrophysical point of view a further motivation is represented by @xcite , where the discovery of the possible occurrence of stationary configurations of disc plasmas in off - equatorial tori is reported . in that work ,",
    "a newtonian axisymmetric model of non - conductive , charged and perfect fluid tori orbiting in the combined gravitational and dipolar magnetic fields generated by a central compact object is presented .",
    "the result is obtained in the framework of a non - ideal mhd description and shows that the interplay between gravitational and magnetic fields can effectively enhance vertically extended structures in a plasma torus , which may correspond to localized concentrations of matter above and under the equatorial plane .",
    "the importance of this conclusion lies in the possibility of interpreting these off - equatorial tori as forming the surrounding material usually invoked to explain the spectral emission / absorption features in accretion - disc systems .",
    "possible examples of this type are provided by coronal halos consisting of non - neutral ion - electron plasmas or by obscuring dusty - plasma tori that are believed to be produced in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the complete understanding of the physical properties of these structures is far from being satisfactory and deserves further investigations , both theoretical and observational . in particular , here we consider the possibility of a low - density and high - temperature coronal plasma for which the collisionless state applies .",
    "following the arguments discussed above , under these conditions the proper framework for the description of these plasmas is represented by the kinetic theory . in particular , the question is posed of whether kinetic equilibria can be proved to exist for collisionless magnetized plasmas which exhibit off - equatorial maxima in the matter distribution and how these solutions can be possibly related to fluid mhd ones .",
    "this amounts at identifying the appropriate kinetic regimes which meet these conditions and determining the spatial dependences of the corresponding fluid fields , including the pressure tensor and the intrinsically - kinetic effects contained in the eos . to be successful ,",
    "a program of this type must make possible an analytical approach in accordance with the considerations presented above , to extend the kinetic theory developed in @xcite and to permit its practical application to gain insights into an astrophysical issue of notable importance connected with accretion - disc phenomenology .    to conclude ,",
    "we should comment on the fact that the reference works cited above on kinetic theory and off - equatorial tori as well as the present investigation are carried out in the framework of a non - relativistic description ( both with respect to the treatment of the gravitational field and the plasma velocities ) .",
    "however , the problem of general - relativistic solutions could in principle be posed , since there is a number of situations in which the formation of accretion discs is due to strong gravitational fields , e.g. around black holes , and general - relativistic corrections must be considered .",
    "although a complete theory of this type is still missing , non - relativistic treatments can nevertheless provide the reference framework for the inclusion of some relevant features characteristic of general - relativistic theories .",
    "this can be achieved for example by the adoption of pseudo - newtonian potentials for the description of spherically - symmetric gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , in fact , that the precision of the pseudo - newtonian description of stationary general - relativistic phenomena can be very high @xcite .",
    "an alternative consists in the inclusion of post - newtonian corrections . in this reference , a kinetic theory of self - gravitating collisionless gases adopting such a technique can be found in @xcite for spherical solutions , and in @xcite for the case of axially - symmetric solutions .",
    "in view of the considerations presented above , the purpose of this paper is the formulation of a kinetic theory appropriate for the analytical treatment of collisionless disc plasmas in axisymmetric off - equatorial tori ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] for a schematic view of the configuration geometry ) .",
    "the results of the investigation are the following ones :    .[fig-1 ]    \\1 ) the identification of a physically - realizable astrophysical configuration in which the spatial profiles of the potentials @xmath21 can be analytically prescribed , when suitable plasma orderings apply . in the framework of an asymptotic theory ,",
    "this permits to decouple the vlasov equation from the maxwell equations , at least to leading - order , with the possibility of an explicit treatment of the spatial dependences contained in the equilibrium plasma fluid fields .",
    "2 )  the construction of species equilibrium kdfs which are consistent with the kinetic constraints imposed by microscopic phase - space conservation laws for the single particle dynamics .",
    "these are proved to be expressed in terms of generalized maxwellian kdfs characterized by non - uniform fluid fields and isotropic temperature , both to be associated with a finite set of structure functions .",
    "\\3 ) the identification of the relevant kinetic regimes which can in principle arise in the configuration determined at point 1 ) above and the prescription of the corresponding functional dependences on the structure functions .",
    "4 )  the development of a perturbative theory which makes possible a representation of the equilibrium kdfs in terms of a chapman - enskog series . as a result , this permits first the analytical evaluation of the plasma fluid fields , and second to distinguish the characteristic kinetic effects which enter the solution and their main physical properties .",
    "\\5 ) the proof that the gravitationally - bound and magnetized plasma regime provides the most general functional dependences in the structure functions carried by the equilibrium kdf , which are consistent both with the analytical treatment of the fluid fields and the occurrence of off - equatorial tori . as an illustration of the technique , explicit calculation of the leading - order species number density and velocity profiles",
    "is provided for two configurations of physical interest .",
    "\\6 ) the calculation of the eos for the equilibrium plasma , to be expressed in terms of the species pressure tensor associated with the kdf . by making use of the perturbative treatment ,",
    "this includes also the identification of both the kinetic effects and the es corrections that can effectively contribute to the eos . in particular ,",
    "the latter are shown to determine non - trivial deviations from the assumption of having thermal pressure for the collisionless plasma .",
    "\\7 ) to determine the constraints to be imposed on the kinetic solution for the validity of the theory and the physical configuration realized , which arise from the maxwell equations for the self - generated equilibrium em fields .",
    "these represent necessary conditions which must be verified a posteriori  for the complete solution of the vlasov - maxwell problem and the explicit treatment of es corrections in comparison with fluid - based approaches .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows . in section 3",
    "the model assumptions and the fundamental em orderings are presented .",
    "section 4 deals with the definition of plasma orderings and the introduction of corresponding kinetic regimes which characterize collisionless plasmas treated here . in section 5",
    "the equilibrium species kdfs are explicitly determined and their realizations are given for three different plasma regimes . in section 6 a suitable perturbative theory is developed , which allows for the analytical treatment of the equilibrium kdfs and the corresponding fluid fields .",
    "the conditions for the occurrence of off - equatorial tori are then investigated in the case of collisionless plasmas belonging to the gravitationally - bound and magnetized plasma regime . in section 7 the expression of the kinetic corrections which characterize the kinetic equilibria",
    "is provided , while the corresponding contributions in the eos are computed in section 8 .",
    "section 9 contains analysis of the poisson and the ampere equations and the constraints which they pose on the kinetic solution . finally , concluding remarks are summarized in section 10 .",
    "for the construction of kinetic equilibria , we ignore the possible existence of weakly - dissipative effects ( coulomb collisions and turbulence ) and em radiation effects @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the kdf and the em fields associated with the plasma obey the system of vlasov - maxwell equations , with maxwell s equations being considered in the quasi - static approximation . for definiteness",
    ", we shall consider here a plasma consisting of @xmath22-species of charged particles which are characterized by proper mass @xmath6 and total charge @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , given a generic species kdf @xmath23 defined in the phase - space @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the configuration and velocity space respectively , the vlasov equation determines the dynamical evolution of @xmath27 and is given by@xmath28    the plasma is taken to be : a ) non - relativistic , in the sense that the flow velocities of all species are small compared to the speed of light @xmath29 , that the gravitational field can be treated within the classical newtonian theory , and that the non - relativistic vlasov kinetic equation is used as the dynamical equation for the kdf ;  b ) collisionless , so that the mean free path of the plasma particles is much longer than the largest characteristic scale length of the plasma ; c )  axisymmetric , so that the relevant dynamical variables characterizing the plasma ( e.g. , the fluid fields ) are independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath30 when referred to a set of either cylindrical coordinates @xmath31 or spherical coordinates @xmath32 . thanks to the axisymmetry assumption , as a shortway in the following we shall denote with @xmath33 the configuration state vector , where @xmath33 denotes either @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "we are concerned here with quasi - stationary configurations , namely solutions which are slowly - varying in time .",
    "this condition is also referred to as equilibrium configuration . for a generic physical quantity @xmath36 that depends on spatial coordinates @xmath33 and time @xmath37 ,",
    "the quasi - stationarity is expressed by letting in the following @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being a small dimensionless parameter to be suitably defined ( see below ) and @xmath40 an integer .",
    "similar considerations apply for the equilibrium kdf @xmath27 , which is denoted in the following as @xmath41 .    from the symmetry properties introduced here",
    "one can immediately derive the fundamental quantities which are conserved for the single - particle dynamics .",
    "in particular , under the assumptions of axisymmetry the canonical momentum conjugate to the azimuthal angle @xmath42 is an integral of motion .",
    "this is given by:@xmath43furthermore , from the condition of quasi - stationarity , the total particle energy@xmath44represents an adiabatic invariant of prescribed order , with @xmath2 being defined in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , here we recall that a generic quantity @xmath45 defined in the phase - space is an adiabatic invariant of order @xmath46 with respect to @xmath47 when it satisfies the condition @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a suitable integer and @xmath50 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "this means that adiabatic invariants are conserved in asymptotic sense , namely up to a prescribed order of accuracy determined by the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "we consider solutions of the equilibrium magnetic field @xmath51 which admit , at least locally , a family of nested axisymmetric toroidal magnetic surfaces @xmath52 , where @xmath1 denotes the poloidal magnetic flux of @xmath51 .",
    "the magnetic surfaces can be either locally closed @xcite or locally open @xcite in the configuration domain occupied by the plasma . in both cases",
    "a set of magnetic coordinates ( @xmath53 ) can be defined locally , where @xmath17 is a curvilinear angle - like coordinate on the magnetic surfaces @xmath54 by construction , magnetic coordinates are related to cylindrical or spherical coordinates by a diffeomorphism @xmath55 which must be consistently determined , as discussed above .",
    "each relevant physical quantity @xmath56 can then be conveniently expressed either in terms of the set @xmath33 or as a function of the magnetic coordinates , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "consistent with these assumptions , we require the em field to be slowly - varying in time , i.e. , of the form @xmath58 in particular , we assume the magnetic field to be represented as@xmath59where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the self - generated magnetic field produced by the plasma and a finite external axisymmetric magnetic field ( vacuum field ) . for definiteness , in this treatment both contributions are assumed to exhibit only non - vanishing poloidal components , to be denoted in the following as @xmath62 .",
    "notice that , for what concerns the self - field , this assumption must be verified a posteriori  to be consistent with the constraints placed on the kinetic solution by the maxwell equations .",
    "hence , the two fields are represented as@xmath63so that the total poloidal magnetic field takes the form@xmath64with @xmath65 .",
    "in particular , for the purpose of the present work , the external magnetic field is taken to coincide with a dipolar field .",
    "in such a case , the flux function @xmath66 is written in terms of the spherical coordinates @xmath67 as@xmath68with @xmath69 being the magnitude of the dipole magnetic moment .",
    "charged particles are also assumed to be subject to the effective potential @xmath70 defined by eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) . in principle",
    ", both the es potential @xmath71 and the gravitational potential @xmath72 can be produced by the plasma itself and by external sources .",
    "however , in the following it is assumed that @xmath71 is uniquely generated by the plasma charge density , while we shall neglect the self contribution of the plasma to @xmath4 .",
    "hence , for an axisymmetric disc , the gravitational potential is taken as being stationary and to coincide identically with the potential generated by the central compact object .",
    "the latter is expressed here in terms of the spherically - symmetric newtonian potential as@xmath73where @xmath74 is the newton gravitational constant and @xmath75 is the mass of the compact object .    given validity of these assumptions , in order to address the first issue posed in the section 2 we proceed introducing the following fundamental orderings for the self em fields:1 )  the self component of the equilibrium magnetic field @xmath60 is ordered with respect to the external field @xmath61 as@xmath76with @xmath77 , and in general @xmath78.2 ) the equilibrium es potential @xmath5 satisfies the ordering assumption@xmath79with @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the es potential energy is small with respect to the gravitational potential energy , where @xmath47 will be properly defined below . in the following the case @xmath80 in eqs .",
    "( [ basic ] ) and ( [ eees ] ) will be considered .",
    "it is important to remark that the two conditions ( [ basic ] ) and ( eees ) pose strong constraints from the physical point of view on the realizability of the equilibrium configuration for the collisionless disc plasma .",
    "in particular , they must be verified a posteriori  in order to warrant the consistency of the kinetic equilibrium solution for the species kdf with the validity of the maxwell equations .",
    "( [ basic ] ) and ( [ eees ] ) are the fundamental em orderings which permit the analytical treatment of the spatial dependences of the equilibrium fluid fields as prescribed by the kinetic solution to be determined below .",
    "in fact , when these orderings hold , to leading - order the magnetic flux function @xmath1 and the effective potential @xmath2 coincide respectively with the vacuum fields , namely the external dipolar flux function @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ dipolo ] ) and with the gravitational potential @xmath4 given by eq .",
    "( newton ) .",
    "hence , at this order it is possible to construct explicitly the diffeomorphism which relates the spherical coordinates @xmath67 with the potentials @xmath82 .",
    "this is expressed by letting@xmath83the corresponding relationship holding for cylindrical coordinates can then be obtained from the spherical ones , giving in particular@xmath84",
    "in this section we introduce the relevant orderings for collisionless plasmas , which permit to identify corresponding kinetic regimes characterized by different equilibrium solutions and to verify their consistency with the existence of off - equatorial tori . to this aim",
    "we determine a classification scheme based on the method outlined in @xcite and suitable for the treatment of the physical setting indicated in the previous section .",
    "the first step is the definition of the dimensionless species - dependent parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "these are prescribed in such a way to be all independent of single - particle velocity and at the same time to be related to the characteristic species thermal velocities .",
    "both perpendicular and parallel thermal velocities ( defined with respect to the magnetic field local direction ) must be considered .",
    "these are defined respectively by @xmath88  and @xmath89 , with @xmath90  and @xmath91  denoting here the species perpendicular and parallel temperatures . in detail , the first parameter is defined as @xmath92 , where @xmath93  is the species larmor radius , with @xmath94  being the characteristic scale - length of the spatial variations of all of the fluid fields associated with the kdf and of the em fields .",
    "the second parameter @xmath86  is related to the particle canonical momentum @xmath95 . by denoting @xmath96 , @xmath86",
    "is identified with @xmath97 .",
    "hence , @xmath86  effectively measures the ratio between the toroidal angular momentum @xmath98  and the magnetic contribution to the toroidal canonical momentum , for all particles in which @xmath99  is of the order @xmath100  while @xmath1  is assumed as being non - vanishing .",
    "in particular , here the magnetic flux can be estimated as @xmath101 , with @xmath102  denoting the characteristic length - scale of flux variations and @xmath103 the magnitude of the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "note that , by definition , @xmath104 , but , in principle , we can also have @xmath105 locally .",
    "we also notice that the present definition of @xmath86 is not the only possibility , as one could also define the parameter @xmath86 such that it is related to the azimuthal flow velocity , namely letting @xmath106 , with @xmath107 being the corresponding angular frequency .",
    "finally , @xmath87  is related to the particle total energy @xmath108  and is prescribed in this work as @xmath109 .",
    "it follows that @xmath87  measures the ratio between particle kinetic and es potential energy with respect to the gravitational potential energy , for all particles having velocity @xmath110  of the order @xmath111 , with @xmath4 being assumed as non - vanishing .",
    "we notice that the definition of @xmath87 differs from that used in previous works @xcite while it is consistent with the ordering assumption ( [ eees ] ) . in the following",
    "we shall denote as thermal subset of velocity space the subset of the euclidean velocity space in which the asymptotic conditions @xmath112 holds .",
    "a comment is in order regarding the role of the magnetic field in the two parameters @xmath86 and @xmath85 . in the first case , the magnetic field",
    "is represented by means of the poloidal flux @xmath1 which contributes to the toroidal canonical momentum @xmath95 , while @xmath85 depends on the magnitude of the total magnetic field . invoking the definitions for @xmath86 and @xmath85  given above",
    ", it follows that @xmath113 , where @xmath94  and @xmath102  are respectively the characteristic scale - lengths of equilibrium fluid and em fields and of the poloidal flux . in general , the two quantities should be considered as independent , with @xmath104 and @xmath114 ( in the present context one has identically @xmath115from eq .",
    "( [ b field ] ) ) .",
    "indeed , the parameter @xmath86 determines the particle spatial excursions from a magnetic flux surface , while @xmath85  measures the amplitude of the larmor radius with respect to the inhomogeneities of the background fluid fields .",
    "these two effects correspond to different physical magnetic - related processes , due respectively to the larmor - radius and magnetic - flux surface confinement mechanisms .    in this work",
    "we assume that the ordering condition@xmath116holds for the collisionless plasma considered here .",
    "this amounts at requiring that the larmor radius remains small with respect to the scale - length @xmath94 , which , as shown in @xcite , represents a condition that is expected to be easily verified in accretion - disc systems .",
    "hence , one can consistently identify the small parameter @xmath47 introduced above with @xmath117 .",
    "the classification that is introduced in this work is based on the magnitude of the two parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in detail ,",
    "plasma species will be distinguished as belonging to the following regimes:1 ) _ gravitationally - bound _ if @xmath118 and @xmath119.2 )  _ magnetized _ if @xmath120 and @xmath121.3 ) _ gravitationally - bound and magnetized _ if both @xmath118 and @xmath120 .    in the case of regimes 1 and 3",
    "the following asymptotic expansion holds for the total particle energy @xmath122:@xmath123 .",
    "\\label{order - sigma}\\]]similarly , for regimes 2 and 3 the particle canonical momentum @xmath124 admits the expansion@xmath125 .",
    "\\label{ordering - epsilon}\\]]it is instructive to analyze the main features of these regimes and the physical conditions for their occurrence .",
    "the action of some energy non - conserving mechanisms is required for the establishment of the case of gravitationally - bound plasmas . in particular , plausible physical mechanisms that can be responsible for the decrease of the single - particle kinetic energy , in both collisionless and collisional ad plasmas , are em interactions ( e.g. , binary coulomb collisions among particles and particle - wave interactions , such as landau damping ) and/or radiation emission ( radiation - reaction ) .",
    "these can in principle be ascribed also to the occurrence of em instabilities and em turbulence .",
    "for single particles these processes can be dissipative . as a consequence ,",
    "these particles tend to move towards regions with higher gravitational potential ( in absolute value ) .",
    "after multiple interactions of this type , the process can ultimately reach an equilibrium state which corresponds to the gravitationally - bound regimes .",
    "as far as the magnetic - field based classification , we notice that the requirement @xmath120 ( regimes 2 and 3 ) means that a particle trajectory remains close to the same magnetic surface @xmath126 , while satisfying the ordering ( [ eps - emme ] ) .",
    "finally , for greater generality , in the rest of the treatment we shall assume that , in the regimes in which @xmath118 and/or @xmath120 , the orderings @xmath127 and @xmath128 apply .",
    "in this section we proceed with the construction of the species equilibrium kdf and its characterization to the plasma regimes identified above . we consider both exact as well as asymptotic representations for the solution , the latter being expressed in terms of a chapman - enskog series . to reach the goal , here we adopt the solution technique developed in @xcite , which consists in the construction of solutions of the vlasov equation of the form @xmath129 , where @xmath130  is a suitable adiabatic invariant .",

    "the formulation is based on a multi - species kinetic approach developed in the framework of the vlasov - maxwell description .",
    "the case of astrophysical plasmas arising in the gravitational field of compact objects and in the presence of both an external dipolar magnetic field and self electromagnetic fields has been treated .",
    "three different plasma regimes have been identified which are characetrized by distinctive kinetic orderings .",
    "it has been proved that in all cases consistent kinetic equilibria can be determined , with the kinetic distribution function being expressed in terms of generalized maxwellian functions .",
    "it has been shown that the three regimes differ by the form of the kinetic constraints which are imposed on the equilibrium solutions and which uniquely follow from phase - space single - particle conservation laws .    by imposing appropriate orderings on the self electromagnetic fields and by developing a suitable perturbative theory ,",
    "an analytical treatment of the equilibria has been proposed . in terms of this ,",
    "several issues have been addressed .",
    "first , the conditions of existence of equilibrium structures corresponding to off - equatorial tori have been investigated .",
    "it has been shown that these systems can generally arise for the regime which has been referred to here as magnetized and gravitationally - bound plasmas .",
    "this analysis can be important from the astrophysical point of view , since off - equatorial tori may represent a physically - realizable model of magnetized coronal plasmas which are believed to characterize accretion discs .",
    "in addition , the treatment based on kinetic theory can pose the basis for comparison with analogous fluid results carried out in terms of mhd theory .    as a second application ,",
    "the plasma equation of state has been determined analytically and expressed in terms of the pressure tensor .",
    "it has been shown that the latter exhibits deviations from the thermal pressure characteristic of collisional plasmas because of the existence of specifically - kinetic effects .",
    "these have been identified with diamagnetic , energy - correction and electrostatic contributions which apply in combination with the occurrence of non - uniform fluid fields .",
    "finally , the validity of the poisson and ampere equations have been addressed , showing that they can introduce non - trivial constraints on the magnitude of the plasma number density and flow velocity for the consistency with the orderings introduced in the theory developed here .",
    "the conclusions established in this work can be relevant for future investigations of astrophysical plasmas in equilibrium configurations , with particular focus on collisionless plasmas in accretion discs and off - equatorial tori associated with compact objects .",
