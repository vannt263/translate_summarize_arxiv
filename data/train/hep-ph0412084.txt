    "let us consider the scattering of two particles at very high energy as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "as the energy grows , so does the probability of emission of soft particles . in the case of qed one has to consider a diagram of the type shown on the left hand side graph in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in qcd",
    "one also encounters these diagrams , but there are also additional diagrams of the type shown on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . since gluons are the carriers of the color charge and couple to each other , the increase of energy causes a fast growth of the gluon density and , consequently , of the cross section .",

    "the growth of the gluon density in the limit of high energy is governed by the bfkl pomeron equation @xcite .",
    "the solution to this equation gives a very strong , power - like growth of the gluon density , and of the resulting cross section @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the bjorken variable ( a fraction of target s longitudinal momentum ) and @xmath5 is the intercept of the perturbative pomeron in the leading logarithmic ( llx , @xmath6 ) approximation . in the pioneering paper @xcite , gribov , levin and",
    "ryskin pointed out that the gluon recombination is important at high energies .",
    "it reduces the growth of the parton density by producing an effect called the _ perturbative partonic saturation_. in @xcite , a new nonlinear evolution equation in double leading logarithmic approximation ( dlla , @xmath7 ) for the gluon density has been postulated .",

    "it is well known that the hadronic cross sections obey the froissart bound @xcite which stems from the general assumptions of the analyticity and unitarity of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the froissart bound implies that the total cross section does not grow faster than the logarithm squared of the energy _",

    "it is generally believed , that the parton saturation mechanism leads to the unitarization of the cross section at high energies .",
    "unfortunately , the problem is quite complex since the parton saturation is purely perturbative mechanism while the froissart bound has been derived from general principles and it refers to the qcd as to a complete theory of strong interactions ( including the nonperturbative effects ) .",
    "the glr postulate resulted in increased efforts to develop a theory able to describe the saturation at high energies .",
    "one effective theory for high density partonic systems at small @xmath4 is the color glass condensate @xcite with the resulting jimwlk evolution equations @xcite . another approach has been developed by balitsky @xcite who constructed an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for correlators of wilson lines . in the mean field approximation",
    "the first equation of this theory decouples , and is equivalent to the kovchegov equation @xcite ( derived independently in the dipole approach @xcite ) .",

    "this bound applies for the total cross section for scattering of two hadrons , and reads as follows _ tot ( s)^2 .",
    "its derivation is based on two assumptions : the unitarity of partial amplitudes and the finite length of the strong interaction .",

    "f p_fi = i | s^ s | i = 1 , which is interpreted as a unitarity condition for the s - matrix ( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "+ the second assumption is on the finite range @xmath46 of strong force determined by the mass scale @xmath10 r ~ , which determines the cutoff . the scale @xmath10 is entirely nonperturbative .",
    "the froissart bound can be derived @xcite by using these two assumptions and the mandelstam representation .",
    "one has to stress that the froissart bound is applicable to the complete qcd theory that includes both perturbative and non - perturbative parts .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that while one believes that froissart bound is valid , it is not immediately visible from the data .",

    "structure function @xmath49 is averaged over the impact parameter of the @xmath50 collision .",
    "it is also known that saturation effects crucially depend on this variable .",
    "therefore the search for the saturation should involve more exclusive processes , e.g. diffraction . for more information on the saturation phenomenology consult @xcite and references therein .",
    "given that the froissart bound should be satisfied , a natural question arises : how to modify the perturbative evolution in order to tame the growth of the cross section ?",
    "one would like to identify the feynman diagrams which are responsible for gluon recombination and to derive the appropriate evolution equations that include these diagrams . as already stated in the introduction ,",
    "the standard evolution equations lead to a strong rise of the parton density in high energy limits",

    "the larger the size of the partons , the earlier they fill up the available area and start to reinteract",
    ". a further increase of the energy will not increase the probed parton density .",
    "therefore , apart from production diagrams , one has to include additional diagrams which take into account gluon recombination .",
    "this leads to the modification of the evolution equation by a term which is nonlinear in density .",

    "more precisely , balitsky s equations form an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for correlators of wilson lines , and only in the mean field approximation the first equation decouples and is equivalent to the equation derived by kovchegov .",

    "t u(t , x ) = _ x^2(t , x)+u(t , x ) [ 1-u(t , x ) ] , [ eq : fkkp ] where the change of variables from @xmath142 to @xmath143 has been performed with simultaneous identification of @xmath144 .",
    "fkpp equation has been already studied in many fields of physics , and its solutions are very well understood .",
    "in particular it is well known that the fkpp equation has a travelling wave solution for large times ( which are equivalent to large energies ) which is just a property of geometrical scaling . for a review",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "as we have already stated , the bk equation has been derived within the leading logarithmic in @xmath145 ( llx ) approximation in which the coupling constant is fixed .",
    "however , it is very well known fact , that nllx effects are very important in the bfkl formalism @xcite . at nllx order the coupling runs , and the linear bfkl equation becomes very unstable .",
    "the reason is that the linear evolution is very sensitive to the details of the running coupling regularization .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : runcoupling ] where we show the solution @xmath146 with the running coupling , as a function of the transverse momentum for increasing values of @xmath31 . for small values of rapidity",
    "the position of the maximum remains close to the value of the initial condition @xmath147 .",
    "however as the rapidity increases the position of the maximum abruptly shifts to the small values of momenta .",
    "the actual shape of the solution are critically dependent on the regularized value of the coupling , @xmath148 .    with the inclusion of the running coupling the bk equation has the following form = ( k,y ) - ( k ) ^2(k , y ) .",
    "[ eq : bkrc ]    the solution to the above equation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkrc ] , superimposed onto the solution of the linear bfkl equation .",
    "the solution is much more stable than in the linear case , and the maximum of the distribution is not shifted to the infrared .",
    "instead as rapidity increases , the maximum moves towards the higher values of transverse momenta .",
    "the reason for this is that the nonlinear term strongly damps the diffusion into the infrared regime .",
    "the saturation scale @xmath117 provides a natural cutoff for the low momenta and then no dependence on the regularisation of the running coupling is seen ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one might ask whether the geometrical scaling is still preserved in the presence of the additional scale @xmath149 which is implicitly introduced by use of the running coupling constant .",
    "it turns out that the scaling still holds , although the saturation scale has a different rapidity dependence ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) q_s(y ) = _ qcd ( ) , [ eq : qsatrc ] with @xmath150 .",
    "the above formula has been derived by assuming that the local exponent of the saturation scale @xmath151 has the similar form as in the case of the fixed coupling @xmath152 by using these two formulae one can derive the saturation scale for the running coupling ( [ eq : qsatrc ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of saturation discussed so far has been based on the properties of the solutions to the bk equation in @xmath154 dimensions .",
    "such approach ignores the spatial distribution of the probe - target system .",
    "the solution to @xmath107 dimensional bk equation is integrated over the impact parameter .",
    "this is a result of the fact that in @xmath154 dimensional case we have assumed an infinite size of the target , and ignored any edge effects .",
    "one might expect that the more realistic picture of saturation looks as follows : as the probe collides with the target , a dense system of partons emerges in the limited region of the impact parameter space . for larger impact parameters , the density of partons becomes more and more dilute .",
    "the radius of the dense , saturated system expands with the growth of the energy .",
    "this process is schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : ippicture ] .",
    "one expects that the impact parameter profile of the scattering amplitude has the behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdepsche ] .",
    "a question thus arises whether bk equation can provide information about the impact parameter profile of the amplitude , and whether this profile is consistent with the qualitative picture of saturation .",
    "let us recall the bk equation with full dependence on all coordinates    @xmath90 \\;. \\label{eq : kov1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    as stated before , in general the problem is very difficult , even numerically , since one has four degrees of freedom per dipole plus rapidity as the evolution variable . even though the integral measure does not depend on the positions of the dipoles",
    ", the impact parameter dependence still exists .",
    "it is implicitly generated via the couplings of @xmath155 to @xmath156 in the arguments of the functions @xmath108 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : kov1 ] . to simplify the problem , and",
    "yet retain the information about the impact parameter dependence , we note that measure in the equation @xmath157 is invariant under global rotations in transverse space @xmath158 see fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoleposition ] .",
    "therefore one can assume that the position of the dipole is specified by three variables : the dipole size @xmath55 , the impact parameter @xmath159 , and the relative orientation of the dipole with respect to the impact parameter axis ( angle @xmath160 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dipoleposition ] .",
    "the invariance with respect to global rotations is equivalent to a condition that the target is cylindrically symmetrical .",
    "thus the problem reduces to @xmath153 dimensions : @xmath161 .",
    "the bk equation with the impact parameter dependence has been investigated numerically @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "here we show some of the results taken from @xcite , which used the initial distribution in glauber - mueller form n^(0)(r , b,;y=0 ) = 1-(-r^2 s(b ) ) , [ eq : gmformula ] where the impact parameter profile has been chosen to be of the gaussian type s(b ) = ( -b^2 /b_0 ^ 2 ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdepkov ] we show the resulting impact parameter dependence of the bk solutions calculated for different values of rapidity @xmath31 . for small values of @xmath159 the amplitude is large and strong nonlinear effects are evident . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath159",
    "one observes a fast growth of the amplitude is governed by the linear part of the equation .",
    "one can verify that the increase is exponential in rapidity as expected from the bfkl equation .",
    "the region in impact parameter space , where the amplitude is large , expands with growing rapidity . however , perhaps the most striking feature is the fact that the initial profile in impact parameter is not preserved even after a small step in rapidity , @xmath162 .",
    "the exponential tail of the initial distribution immediately assumes power behaviour @xmath163 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the origin of these power tails .",
    "one can divide the region of integration into long- and short - range parts by introducing a separating cutoff @xmath164 on the dipole size .",
    "@xmath165 \\frac{d^2 \\xbtwo ( \\xbzero-\\xbone)^2}{(\\xbzero-\\xbtwo)^2 ( \\xbone-\\xbtwo)^2 } \\nonumber",
    "\\\\   \\cdot \\left(n_{02}^{(0)}+n_{12}^{(0)}-n_{01}^{(0)}-n_{02}^{(0 ) } n_{12}^{(0 ) } \\right)\\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : shortlong ] the profile in impact parameter space has been decomposed into short and long range contributions .",
    "one can see that the short range contribution dominates the behaviour at small values of @xmath159 .",
    "there the exponential behaviour is preserved since we have the factorisation of the initial profile @xmath166 at small values of @xmath159 .",
    "the long range contribution is dominating at large values of impact parameter @xmath159 where it generates the power tail .",
    "thus the @xmath163 behaviour originates from the integration of the large dipole sizes and is a reflection of the asymptotic behaviour of the integral kernel ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the power tail in impact parameter has profound consequences for the unitarity .",
    "power decrease of the amplitude means that the interaction is long range . as already stated it ,",
    "is a direct consequence of the power - like form of the integral kernel @xmath167 this type of fast expansion of the interaction system leads to the violation of the froissart bound , as has been first observed in @xcite ( compare also a parallel discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that even though the amplitude is equal or less than @xmath168 , due to the nonlinearity of the equation , the dipole cross section increases fast with the decreasing @xmath4 which violates froissart bound @xmath169 this happens because the kernel in the bk equation is conformally invariant , with no mass scale which would cut off the long range contributions .",
    "the dipole size dependence in the case of the impact parameter dependent bk equation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdepbsmall ] where the value for the impact parameter has been chosen to correspond to a central collision . for small and moderate values of @xmath55",
    "it has qualitatively the same behaviour as previously , the amplitude vanishes as @xmath55 tends to @xmath170 and extends to lower values of @xmath55 as rapidity grows .",
    "it also saturates to @xmath168 for moderate values of @xmath55 .",
    "however , at large values of the dipole size the situation is dramatically different . here",
    "the amplitude drops down again .",
    "the reason is that now there is a dimension in impact parameter which characterizes the size of the target .",
    "as the dipole grows , at some point it has to completely miss the target and amplitude becomes zero again .",
    "this is quite different from the previous case ( without the impact parameter ) where the amplitude was always saturated since there was an infinite target .",
    "it is also interesting to study the solutions at different values of @xmath159 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdepblarge ] we present the dipole size dependence of the amplitude for larger value of @xmath159 which corresponds to a peripheral collision of the dipole with the target . in that case",
    "we see that the amplitude peaks for values of the dipole size twice the size of the impact parameter .",
    "this is expected , since it reflects the properties of the integral kernel in the bk equation .",
    "the solution in the b - dependent case has also several other interesting properties . for values of dipole size much smaller than the impact parameter @xmath171",
    ", the amplitude depends only on a single combined variable @xmath172 .",
    "this dependence on one variable , the _ anharmonic ratio _ , is the result of the conformal symmetry , see for example @xcite .",
    "one can also extract the saturation scale from the solution to bk equation in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions . in @xcite a following prescription has been used n(r=1/q_s , b,;y ) _",
    "[ eq : bdepss ] from fig .",
    "[ fig : rdepbsmall ] we see that the above equation possesses two solutions @xmath173    the lower bound @xmath174 is the impact parameter dependent saturation scale , which has been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdepss ] .",
    "we see that the saturation scale has strong dependence on @xmath159 , it is largest at small values of impact parameter and then decreases for large values of impact parameter .",
    "the physical picture is that while the impact parameter is increased , one moves from a strongly saturated regime to a more dilute one .",
    "the tail of the saturation scale is again power like @xmath175 which is to be expected from the properties of the integral kernel .",
    "we see that this behaviour is different from the one that could be anticipated from initial conditions ( compare dashed lines ) .",
    "the saturation scale has following behaviour @xmath176 where function @xmath177 is exponentially falling for small values of @xmath159 and has a power like behaviour at large values of impact parameter .",
    "the second solution @xmath178 is new compared to the b - independent case , and it just reflects the fact the there is an additional scale present , the finite size of the target .",
    "we have described basic properties of the bk equation which is a nonlinear evolution equation suitable for the description of partonic systems at high density .",
    "we have shown that the solution to this equation has a property of geometrical scaling with the characteristic saturation scale .",
    "the nice property of this equation is the suppression of the infrared diffusion and independence of the regularization for the running coupling .",
    "the impact parameter dependence of this equation leads to the violation of the froissart bound despite the fact that the amplitude is bounded from above .",
    "this is a consequence of purely perturbative approach and the lack of long distance effects such as confinement in the bk equation .",
    "however , the bk equation has been derived by using strong assumptions about lack of correlations in the system and it is thus an equation in mean field approximation .",
    "it is not clear to what extent the bk equation is a good approximation to the full balitsky - jimwlk equations . in numerical studies of the dipole scattering by salam",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the fluctuations are very important and lead to a very different result as compared with the mean field approach .",
    "a lot of theoretical effort has been recently devoted to study the role of correlations : in @xcite a more quantitative study of the fluctuations has been proposed , in @xcite a new equation for the generating functional was postulated which takes into account correlations in the nuclei ; in @xcite a bk equation with two absorptive boundaries has been studied ; in @xcite a numerical study of the full jimwlk equation has been performed for the first time ; in @xcite an analytical study of the balitsky hierarchy restricted to the dipole operators , and in @xcite the role of the discreteness of the gluon system and connection to the statistical physics have been discussed .",
    "we expect that this line of research will be continued in the near future and we will be able to understand the fascinating and complex theory of strong interactions even better .",
