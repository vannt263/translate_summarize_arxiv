    "anomalous enhancement of the sub - barrier nuclear fusion reaction d(d , p)t in a deuterated metallic matrix has been experimentally observed at energies of the incident beam lower than few kev @xcite .",
    "electron screening is not sufficient to explain this enhancement , and other quantitative explanations are missing  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the calculated ( adiabatic limit ) electron screening potential energy @xmath0 is 28  ev , but experiments show an exponential enhancement of the cross section at very low energies that would correspond to a screening energy @xmath1  ev @xcite .",
    "similar behaviors are found in gaseous targets .",
    "these discrepancies between the calculated @xmath0 and the experimentally inferred @xmath2 have not yet been understood @xcite ; these puzzling results could have important consequences also for the study of nuclear fusion in astrophysical environments  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss a possible explanation of this enhancement which is based on the quantum - uncertainty dispersive effect between energy and momentum that was proposed by galitskij and yakimets @xcite and recently discussed and applied by starostin et al .",
    "experimental data for the d(d , p)t reaction in a deuterated tantalium target  @xcite are reported for beam energies in the range 4 - 20  kev .",
    "the target is cooled with nitrogen at a temperature of 10 @xmath3c , which corresponds to a thermal energy @xmath4  ev .",

    "[ fig : raiolasigmav ] the experimental values of @xmath5 are plotted versus the center of mass energy @xmath6 .",
    "since the incoming particles are not relativistic and the target particles are practically at rest , these data are plotted using @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the reduced mass ) .",
    "the unscreened cross section can be written as : @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the astrophysical factor @xmath12 should vary slowly in this energy range and is linearly approximated as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are extrapolated from energies @xmath16 kev ( see panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : raiolasigmav ] ) ; the values reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are @xmath17  kev  b and @xmath18  b.    the interacting nuclei `` feel '' a effective potential barrier lower by an amount equal the electron screening potential @xmath19 : the resulting screened cross section is : @xmath20 when @xmath21 a correction factor @xmath22 can be factorized : @xmath23 where @xmath24 the electron screening potential computed in the adiabatic limit @xmath0 constitutes a theoretical upper limit for @xmath19 : @xmath25 for d+d reactions , fig .",

    "( [ eq : barecrosssec ] ) and the `` screened curve '' ( @xmath26 ev ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : screenedcrosssec ] ) with the experimental data .",
    "the screened cross section with @xmath27 ev underestimates the experimental data by about an order of magnitude in the few kev energy range ; the data could be fitted only by using an unphysical electron potential much larger than the adiabatic upper limit : @xmath28 ev @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 equation ( [ eq : screenedcrosssec ] ) implies @xmath31 and , once again , only the screened curve with @xmath28 ev fits the data .    in summary , there is experimental evidence of anomalously high values of low - energy fusion cross sections that would require electron screening potentials @xmath19 one order of magnitude larger than their adiabatic limit , if explained in terms of screening . in deuterated metal targets ,",
    "the effect depends strongly on the metal @xcite ) .",
    "values of @xmath32 are required also for describing experiments with gas target , but violations of the requirement @xmath33 are less strong than in metal targets .",
    "these anomalous values of @xmath19 are substantially unexplained ; the screened potential approach is probably trying to mimic important processes that have been disregarded .",
    "one should attempt to find alternative mechanisms that could reproduce the enhancement of the cross section at low energy .",
    "the parameters of the experiments ( temperature and beam energy ) are such that thermal corrections can be neglected .",
    "in fact if we average @xmath34 over a maxwellian distribution of velocity , the temperature correction factor @xmath35 can be estimated @xcite : @xmath36 @xmath37 for d+d reactions ( @xmath38  kev ) even at room temperature ( @xmath39  kev ) and at the lowest energies of the beam ( @xmath40 kev ) the maxwellian thermal factor @xmath41 .    as showed by galitskij and yakimets @xcite many - body collisions",
    "broaden the relation between momentum and energy of the particles .",
    "since momentum rather than energy determines the scattering amplitude , the reaction cross section must be averaged over a momentum distribution that may differ from the energy one .",
    "the reaction rate for a mono - energetic beam is :    @xmath42    where the center of mass energy @xmath6 is function of the beam - particle and target - particle momentum , and the momentum distribution function of the target particles @xmath43 depends on thermal distribution of the target - particle energies @xmath44 , which we take to be maxwellian , and on the probability that a target particle with energy @xmath45 has momentum @xmath46 ( dispersion relation ) , @xmath47 .",
    "quantum effects are responsible for the dispersion relation between energy and momentum @xmath47 not being a @xmath48-function , but a broader distribution . according to galitskij and yakimets @xcite",
    "the relation between energy and momentum is a lorentzian @xmath49 with @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the collisional frequency and cross section , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the colliding particles density and velocity .    assuming that the collision cross section could be approximated by the bare coulomb cross section @xmath55",
    ", the resulting @xmath56 is @xmath57 where the relations @xmath58 and @xmath59 have been used with @xmath60 the total density and @xmath61 the ( average ) atomic number .    in the asymptotic regime @xmath62 ,",
    "relevant for the particles that undergo fusion , the maxwellian contribution @xmath63 is negligible and the distribution of momenta becomes @xmath64 since only particles in the high - energy tail of the distribution @xmath62 contribute to the fusion rate , the quantum effect contribution @xmath65 is the only important contribution to the rate .",
    "more in general , the fact that the relation between energy and momentum is not a @xmath48-function results in a distribution of momentum @xmath66 with a power - law asymptotic behavior in spite of the energy distribution @xmath67 being exponential .",
    "this power - law tail becomes mostly important for reactions whose cross sections select high - momentum particles .",
    "this quantum contribution can be calculated numerically and we are also developing useful analytical approximations : we shall report elsewhere the derivation of these approximations and their comparison with the exact numerical integration .    in the following we give some preliminary results using a parameterization that is motivated by the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qefftercorr ] ) and that can be used to qualitatively estimate the importance of such quantum broadening of the momentum distribution .    if we use @xmath68 as an upper bound for @xmath69 in the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qefftercorr ] ) ( the precise value of the low bound is inconsequential ) and work in the relevant approximation that the target particles have energies lower than the beam particles , we obtain the following partial parameterization for the dominant contribution @xmath70    in fig .

    "fig : enhancfactcompared ] we have plotted the ratio @xmath71 with @xmath72 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : qefflowenapprox ] ) for three different values of @xmath73 .",
    "the function @xmath74 shows an evident enhancement at low energy starting from the region of 1 - 2  kev in qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "the threshold below which this enhancement becomes important depends on @xmath75 .",
    "we are completing a more detailed calculation that does not require the introduction of the parameter @xmath73 and that , therefore , can better test the relevance of this quantum effect for the experimental results .",
    "the theory of galitskij and yakimets predicts that quantum indeterminacy broadens the relation between energy and momentum .",
    "we have performed a preliminary calculation to estimate the effect of this broadening on the momentum distribution of deuteron in metals and , therefore , on the cross section of the reaction d(d , p)t .",
    "this calculation shows that this quantum effect should give an important enhancement of the cross section at low energies similar to the one observed in the bochum experiments .",
    "a more quantitative comparison between theory and experiments requires the use of more sophisticated analytical or numerical analyses  @xcite and the inclusion of the effects of screening both on the fusion cross section and on the ion - collision cross section .",
