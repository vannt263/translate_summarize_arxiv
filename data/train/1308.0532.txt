    "since the neutrino oscillation results from the super kamiokande experiment in 1998 it is evident that neutrinos have a non - zero rest mass contradictory to the standard model . in a number of experiments on solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos , the mass differences between the three neutrino mass eigenstates and the three mixing angles have been measured .",
    "however , these experiments are not sensitive to the absolute scale of the neutrino mass which needs to be determined in an independent experiment @xcite .",
    "a precise knowledge of the neutrino mass is not only important due to its role in cosmological structure formation  @xcite but also to find out which mass generation mechanism is responsible for the neutrino sector .",
    "an important experimental distinction to be made is the determination of the mass hierarchy , i.e. whether the mass states are normally ordered ( @xmath2 ) , inverted ( @xmath3 ) or quasi - degenerate ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "a determination of the mass hierarchy allows to confirm or rule out models of @xmath5-mass generation .",
    "for instance , certain see - saw models , which introduce new physics in the higgs sector , favour a quasi - degenerate scenario @xcite .",
    "moreover , most models introduce additional heavy neutrino mass states , usually identical to or strongly mixed with right - handed ( ` sterile ' ) flavour states . if one of these additional mass states , however , is sufficiently light ( i.e. in the ev to kev range ) and at least slightly mixed with the active flavour states @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 , the sterile neutrino becomes observable in neutrino oscillation experiments and in @xmath1 spectra .",
    "hints towards the existence of light sterile neutrinos in the ev range currently arise for instance from the reactor neutrino anomaly @xcite , the calibration of solar neutrino experiments gallex and sage @xcite and the short baseline accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments lsnd @xcite and miniboone @xcite .",
    "that there might be more than three active neutrinos is also compatible with the total radiation content of the universe obtained from big bang nuclei synthesis and the investigation of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos in the kev range , however , are predicted by the warm dark matter ( wdm ) scenario , which is supported by several astrophysical observations , e.g. the too less structure at galactic scales ( ` missing satellite problem ' ) @xcite .",
    "we will discuss briefly at the end that the method of time - of - flight spectroscopy with gated filter proposed in this paper is not only interesting for the search of sub - ev and ev neutrino masses in @xmath1 spectra but also for kev neutrinos .    in probing the absolute @xmath5 mass scale , the karlsruhe tritium neutrino experiment ( _ katrin _ ) @xcite is designed to measure the neutrino mass , which , in the quasi - degenerate regime accessible to katrin , is an incoherent sum of the light mass eigenstates weighted with their mixing to the electron neutrino @xcite @xmath9    this observable will be determined with a sensitivity of @xmath10 0.2 ev / c@xmath0 ( 90 % c.l . ) .",
    "the predecessor experiments in mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite were successful in finding a 95 % c.l .",
    "upper limit of @xmath11{ev}$]/c@xmath0 and @xmath12{ev}$]/c@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "a further improvement of the sensitivity beyond the katrin design goal would be interesting since the katrin sensitivity limit lies in the critical transition region between hierarchical and the quasi - degenerate scenarios and the other methods sensitive to the neutrino mass , the search for neutrino - less double @xmath1-decay @xcite and cosmology @xcite are of similar sensitivity .",
    "katrin measures the endpoint region of the @xmath13 decay spectrum of tritium , which is a function of @xmath14 .",
    "neglecting the recoil energy of the nucleus as well as radiative corrections the differential decay rate @xcite is at first order given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the kinetic electron energy , @xmath17 the cabbibo angle , @xmath18 the number of tritium atoms , @xmath19 the fermi constant , @xmath20 the nuclear matrix element , @xmath21 the fermi function with the charge of the daughter ion @xmath22 , @xmath23 the electron momentum , @xmath24 the probability to decay to an excited electronic and rotational - vibrational state with excitation energy @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 the beta endpoint , i.e. the maximum kinetic energy in case of @xmath27 .",
    "a non - vanishing neutrino mass changes the spectrum in such a way that the maximal kinetic energy of the decay electrons is lowered to @xmath28 and that in the vicinity of the endpoint @xmath29{kev}$ ] the phase space density of the electron is reduced .",
    "figure [ fig : betaendpoint ] shows the endpoint region for different neutrino mass values @xmath14 .",
    "katrin uses a large spectrometer of mac - e - filter type and a windowless gaseous molecular tritium source for the measurement of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of katrin is principally constrained by the diameter of its spectrometer and its tritium source , which influence the energy resolution and the signal rate , respectively .",
    "since katrin reaches the technical limits regarding these parameters , extending the sensitivity would require complementary methods .    in this paper ,",
    "the idea of a new measurement principle is presented .",
    "it can be performed at a suitable mac - e - filter setup like the main spectrometer of katrin . instead of the classic integrating mode , where the count rate is scanned as a function of the retarding potential , the time - of - flight ( tof ) of every electron passing through the spectrometer",
    "is measured . since the endpoint region of the decay spectrum of tritium is a function of @xmath14 , the distribution of flight times depends as well on the neutrino mass . the mac - e - filter tof mode ( mac - e - tof )",
    "is expected to improve the sensitivity on @xmath14 . since for each retarding potential",
    "not only a count rate but a full tof spectrum is measured , the number of potential steps can be reduced without sensitivity loss . the measurement time which is gained that way",
    "can be invested in obtaining more statistics .",
    "in a classic tritium neutrino experiment the beta spectrum ( [ eq_betaspec ] ) is scanned with a high pass filter using different threshold energies @xmath30 .",
    "thereby , the principle of magnetic adiabatic collimation with an electrostatic filter ( mac - e - filter ) @xcite is applied . to achieve a sharp energy resolution , the electron motion which is isotropic at the source",
    "is converted into a longitudinal movement in the analysing plane where the retarding potential @xmath30 is applied .",
    "the transformation is performed by applying high magnetic fields @xmath31 at the source and @xmath32 at the detector , and a low field @xmath33 in the analysing plane . under adiabatic conditions",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath34 times the relativistic factor @xmath35 is conserved , @xmath36 meaning that the momentum component transverse to the @xmath37 field lines @xmath38 is converted into parallel momentum in low magnetic field regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : macefilter ] ) .",
    "this parallel beam of electrons is energetically analyzed by applying the retarding voltage @xmath39 .",
    "the relative sharpness of this energy high - pass filter depends only on the ratio of the minimum magnetic field @xmath40 reached at the electrostatic barrier in the so called analysing plane and the maximum magnetic field @xmath41 between @xmath1-electron source and spectrometer , where @xmath16 is the starting energy of the electron from an isotropically emitting source : @xmath42    it is beneficial to place the electron source in a magnetic field @xmath43 somewhat lower than @xmath41 .",
    "thus the magnetic - mirror effect based on the adiabatic invariant ( [ eq_adiab ] ) prevents electrons with large starting angles at the source , and therefore long flight paths inside the source , from entering the mac - e - filter . only electrons having starting angles @xmath44 at @xmath43 of :",
    "@xmath45 are able to pass the pinch field @xmath41 .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath46 of the mac - e - filter for an isotropic emitting electron source of energy @xmath16 can be analytically calculated .",
    "normalized to unity at full transmission it reads : @xmath47    in the neutrino mass experiment the count rate is then measured at the detector for each retarding potential @xmath30 which is related to ( [ eq_betaspec ] ) by    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the background rate , @xmath50 the accepted solid angle with @xmath51 and @xmath52 the response function of the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : responsefunction ] ) .",

    "the insert shows the rise of the response functions at small surplus energies @xmath54 governed by the fraction of electrons of approximately 41  % that have undergone no inelastic scattering process .",
    "therefore this rise corresponds to the shape of the transmission function @xmath53 . ]",
    "an alternative idea is to use _ mac - e - filter time of flight ( mac - e - tof ) spectroscopy _ to measure the neutrino mass .",
    "the time of flight ( tof ) of a @xmath1 decay electron through a mac - e - filter like the main spectrometer of katrin is a function of the kinetic energy and the emission angle .",
    "the distribution of the kinetic energies is in first order governed by the beta spectrum ( [ eq_betaspec ] ) which contains the neutrino mass . by measuring the time of flight distribution ( tof spectrum ) of the electrons",
    ", one can reconstruct the parameters determining the beta spectrum , including @xmath55 .",
    "such a method would feature mainly two intrinsic advantages .    on the one hand the mac - e - filter slows down the electrons near the retarding energy .",
    "while the relative velocity differences between raw beta decay electrons near the endpoint are tiny , a tof measurement of beta electrons passing through a mac - e - filter will be very sensitive to subtle energy differences just above the retarding energy .",
    "it can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tofsurplusenergies ] ) that in principle electron energy differences even below the resolution of the mac - e - filter , which is @xmath56{ev}$ ] for 18.5 kev electrons in case of katrin , can be resolved , given a sufficient time resolution .",
    "+    on the other hand , the standard mac - e mode measures only the count rate for each retarding energy , as described above .",
    "in contrast , the tof spectroscopy mode measures the tof for each decay electron .",
    "thus a full tof spectrum , sensitive to @xmath55 , is obtained for each retarding energy . for suitable measurement conditions ,",
    "this gain of information improves the statistics .",
    "the combination of these advantages allows useful optimizations . in principle",
    "it would be sufficient to measure only at a single retarding energy near the beta endpoint , though a small number of selected retarding energies might be more sensitive .",
    "since the systematic uncertainty on @xmath55 grows as the retarding energy is decreased , the goal is to minimize the amount of measurements far from the beta endpoint .",
    "the tof method could in principle provide this and concentrate the measurement on a few retarding energies near the endpoint , each of them delivering a full tof spectrum from which @xmath55 can be disentangled .",
    "the aim is to state the tof spectrum as a function of certain fit parameters .",
    "these comprise the beta endpoint @xmath57 and the square of the neutrino mass @xmath55 , as well as the relative signal amplitude @xmath58 which depends on several factors .",
    "thereby , @xmath57 is in principle known from the @xmath59he - t mass difference measurements in penning traps to 1.2 ev precision @xcite .",
    "however , this is not precise enough to fix it ab initio .",
    "improvements on the beta endpoint precision are on the way @xcite . for a full study also a constant background rate @xmath49 needs to be fitted ,",
    "which is however dependent on the implementation of the measurement method . in order to obtain an expression for the tof spectrum ,",
    "the tof has to be known as a function of the kinetic energy @xmath60 and the starting angle @xmath61 first and then has to be weighted by the corresponding distributions given by the windowless gaseous tritium source @xcite .      within the main spectrometer",
    "the principle of adiabatic motion , where the magnetic moment is constant ( [ eq_adiab ] ) , is valid to good approximation . using a simplified geometry ,",
    "we take only the field on the @xmath62 axis into account and neglect magnetron drifts .",
    "the @xmath37 field then is only a function of the @xmath62 coordinate .",
    "then , the transverse momentum of an electron can be derived from equation ( [ eq_adiab ] ) as a function of @xmath62 ,    @xmath63    where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the electron momentum , its emission angle and the total magnetic field at the electron s starting position @xmath67 .",
    "the fraction reflects the role of the adiabatic magnetic field geometry of the mac - e - filter : as the field @xmath68 decreases , the transverse momentum is converted continuously into longitudinal momentum .",
    "the relativistic energy of the electron is given by the energy - momentum - relation    @xmath69    since the total energy @xmath70 is conserved , we can express the relativistic energy as a function of @xmath62 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the difference of the retarding voltage at the source and at @xmath62 ,    @xmath73    and @xmath74 is the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq_ptrans ] ) , ( [ eq_erel1 ] ) and ( [ eq_erel2 ] ) , we derive an expression for the longitudinal momentum as a function of @xmath62 only in terms of the field @xmath37 and the potential difference @xmath75 :    @xmath76    with the abbreviations @xmath77 and @xmath78 . the tof is determined by integrating the reciprocal parallel velocity @xmath79 over the measurement path .",
    "@xmath80    the lower bound @xmath81 of the integration interval depends on where the start signal time is measured while @xmath82 corresponds to the @xmath62-position of the detector . as the adiabatic approximation ( [ eq_adiab ] ) is valid through the whole transport section , this position is arbitrary .",
    "the starting angle @xmath83 is automatically transformed to its correct value at the start position @xmath84 by ( [ eq_p2c2 ] ) because only the ratio of local and source magnetic field @xmath85 matters but not the field changes between @xmath66 and @xmath86 .",
    "the integral ( [ eq_tof ] ) is only correct for electrons emitted in the center of the fluxtube @xmath87 since the integration path is identical with the z axis . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : macefilter ] , the electrons perform a cyclotron motion around the b field lines , where for the flight - times only the velocity component parallel to the b field lines @xmath88 needs to be considered .",
    "electrons emitted at @xmath87 take a path different from the z axis .",
    "this is , however , not a real shortcoming of our method because at katrin the starting position can be reconstructed by the point of arrival on the multipixel detector .",
    "therefore we do not expect signicant changes in sensitivity depending on the electron emission radius . for this in - principle study of the statistical sensitivity",
    "we consider it to be sufficient to use the central electron tracks only .",
    "equation ( [ eq_tof ] ) presumes a fixed kinetic starting energy and starting angle as arguments . for a real source ,",
    "these parameters are not fixed but follow physical distributions . in order to be calculated numerically , the differential tof spectrum @xmath89 is discretized into bins of constant length @xmath90 and integrated over each bin @xmath91 , leading to a binned spectrum    @xmath92    the number of events in a certain tof bin depends on the distribution of starting energies and angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the double differential event rate as function of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the integral limits @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined in such way that @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . at first order ,",
    "@xmath94 is given by the double differential decay rate @xmath99 into the accepted solid angle @xmath100 ,    @xmath101    as the double differential is proportional to the joint probability distribution of emitting an electron with energy @xmath60 at a polar angle of @xmath61 and , furthermore , the angle and the energy are uncorrelated in case of a non - oriented radioactive source , the quantity can be separated into a product of the single differential decay rate @xmath102 , as given by ( [ eq_betaspec ] ) , and the angular probability distribution @xmath103 @xcite ,    @xmath104    in case of an isotropic tritium source , a sine law applies for the angular distribution ,    @xmath105    this angular distribution function is normalized to unity over the full solid angle @xmath106 . since for katrin the polar angle is restricted to @xmath107 , the signal rate is implicitly reduced by a factor    @xmath108    which is enforced by the upper integral bound @xmath109 in ( [ eq_tofspec ] ) .",
    "the approximation ( [ eq_firstorder ] ) is only valid in case of an ideal tritium source .",
    "however , quite a few electrons lose energy in elastic and inelastic scattering processes with the tritium molecules .",
    "these losses are dependent on the emission angle since the path through the tritium source increases with @xmath110 .",
    "thus , for the differential rate of events which are actually analysed in the main spectrometer , given by @xmath94 in ( [ eq_tofspec ] ) , starting energies and angles become correlated . additionally , the signal rate decreases due to several losses inside the experiment .",
    "a factor @xmath111 applies since the flux tube transported through the whole system corresponds to a diameter of @xmath112 mm w.r.t to the beam tube diameter of 90  mm , meaning that only a part of the wgts tube is imaged onto the detector .",
    "furthermore , the detector efficiency gives an additional factor of @xmath113 .    in total , the true event rate can be calculated by by applying the correction factors and convoluting the beta spectrum with an energy loss function , which gives    @xmath114    where the @xmath115 is the energy loss function of scattering order @xmath116 which is defined recursively through the single scattering energy loss function @xmath117 as    @xmath118    the function @xmath119 is the probability density of losing the energy @xmath120 in a singular scattering event @xcite .",
    "the functions of @xmath115 can then correspondingly be interpreted as the same for @xmath116-fold scattering . in this equation ,",
    "all changes of the angle of the electron during scattering are neglected .",
    "@xmath121 is the probability that an electron is scattered @xmath116 times .",
    "if we again neglect changes of the angle , it is a function of the emission angle @xmath122 and given by a poisson law    @xmath123    here , the expectation value @xmath124 is given in terms of the column density @xmath125 , the mean free column density @xmath126 and the scattering cross section @xmath127 as @xmath128 where the integration factor @xmath129 accounts for the fact that the starting position of the electron inside the wgts is statistically distributed .",
    "to calculate the tof spectrum according to ( [ eq_tofspec ] ) the input parameters have to be obtained .",
    "a model for the one - dimensional field maps @xmath72 and @xmath68 in ( [ eq_tof ] ) has been determined by the katrin simulation tools _ magfield _ and _ elcd3_2 _ @xcite using a modestly simplified geometry that contains the most important coils and electrodes in the main spectrometer ( fig . [",
    "fig : fieldmaps ] ) . a model for the energy loss function ( [ eq_eloss ] ) has been determined in the past by electron scattering experiments on hydrogen @xcite and refined by using excitation and ionisation data from hydrogen molecules @xcite .",
    "the final - state excitation spectrum of the daughter molecules has been used from reference @xcite .    a typical set of simulated tof spectra for different neutrino mass squares",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numasseshighpotential ] .",
    "the following details and parameter - dependent behaviour can be observed :    * for each spectrum , there exists a minimal tof @xmath130 .",
    "this corresponds to the maximum kinetic emission energy that an electron can have , given by @xmath131 . * from @xmath130 on , a steep slope begins , leading soon to a maximum somewhat above @xmath130 , followed again by a long , slow fall .",
    "the maximum can be explained by the fact that the higher the energy becomes , the lower the number of electrons is , due to the shape of the end of the beta spectrum , whereas the tof energy density , i.e. the interval size of the energy that corresponds to a certain tof bin , increases .",
    "these effects balance each other , leading to a maximum somewhere in the middle .",
    "* there is no maximal tof .",
    "the closer the energy of an electron is to the retarding energy , the slower it will be .",
    "that means that electrons with an energy infinitesimally above the retarding energy will have an infinite tof . *",
    "if the neutrino mass square @xmath55 is changed , the main signature is a change in count - rate and a change of the shape especially at the short - time end of the spectrum ( fig .",

    "a higher retarding energy @xmath30 leads to a clearer distinction between spectra for different neutrino masses .",
    "the reason is that the neutrino mass is mainly visible in the last few ev of the beta spectrum .",
    "therefore , it seems optimal for the tof mode to measure with retarding energies near the endpoint .",
    "however , due to the lower count rate and the difficult decorrelation of neutrino mass square and endpoint , measurements from lower retarding energies should be added to the data .        in order to study the statistical uncertainty we used the spectra to fit monte carlo ( mc ) data .",
    "the mc data have been obtained by creating poisson distributed random numbers based on the predictions from ( [ eq_tofspec ] ) , where certain choices of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath26 as well as the retarding energy @xmath30 and the measurement time have been assumed . the data are fitted in this self - consistent method by the models ( [ eq_tofspec ] ) using a @xmath132 minimization method .",

    "the actual improvement factor , however , depends on the method by which the time - of - flight determination is implemented .",
    "furthermore , one can conclude that even a reduction of the systematic uncertainty might be possible with the tof mode .",
    "this is due to the fact that the systematic uncertainty at katrin depends heavily on the measurement interval at which the spectrum is scanned @xcite .",
    "that is mainly caused by the uncertainty of the parameters of the electron energy loss which becomes more important at lower retarding energies .",

    "the creation of a tof spectrum requires a start and a stop time associated with the passage of each detected electron through the spectrometer .",
    "the stop time is easily derived from the pulse produced when the electron is absorbed in the focal - plane detector .",
    "a start time must be produced by some device upstream from the spectrometer .",

    "the dominant energy - loss mechanism is cyclotron radiation  @xcite .",
    "the power radiated scales as the square of the magnetic field @xmath37 , and depends on the pitch angle @xmath122 with respect to the static field .",

    "as is found between the katrin pre - spectrometer and the main spectrometer , the radiated power for 18.6 kev electrons having a 51 degree pitch angle is about 8 fw . if the observation region has a usable length @xmath172 , the time spent by the electron in that region is @xmath173 which , for @xmath174 cm , ranges from 6 to 10 ns depending on the pitch angle .",
    "the energy lost by the electron in free radiation during its transit of the observation region is then @xmath175 ev , only @xmath176 at 1k .",
    "the cyclotron frequency @xmath177 is 126 ghz , still a technically challenging region to work in with non - bolometric amplifiers , and the antenna collection efficiency will necessarily be a compromise in order to allow the electrons to make an unobstructed transit .    more specifically , the noise power is @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the bandwidth .",
    "there are two principal contributions to the bandwidth  the line broadening caused by the duration @xmath165 of the signal , and the broadening caused by magnetic - field inhomogeneity .",
    "we assume the latter can be made smaller than the former , and neglect it .",
    "only a fraction @xmath180 of the radiated signal energy is absorbed in the receiver .",

    "the energy of a cyclotron radiation photon @xmath190 amounts to @xmath191 ev , which is comparable to the whole emitted radiation energy .",

    "they have in common the induction of an image charge in a circuit connected to plates or a cavity . to estimate the energy that can be extracted from a single electron , we consider a conducting cylinder that the electron enters , passes through , and emerges from .",

    "for @xmath194 cm , the stored energy is about @xmath195 ev , which can be delivered to a suitably matched external circuit . because the observation region @xmath172 is considerably longer than the radius of the aperture ,",
    "several probes can be cascaded to increase the energy extracted .",
    "if the probes are cascaded in a phased way , some further enhancement of the energy extraction can be achieved , but the dependence of electron transit times on pitch angle limits the usefulness of resonant structures .",

    "the magnetic energy in the field beyond a minimum radius @xmath199 is @xmath200 the integral over time is equivalent to integrating over the third , axial , coordinate . assuming all of the magnetic energy outside @xmath201 can be delivered to an external circuit , the energy extracted from the electron is @xmath202 ev for @xmath203 cm .",
    "the estimate is somewhat pessimistic , because the spatial width of the instantaneous magnetic field distribution is considerably narrower than @xmath172 , and so this amount of energy could be extracted several times with multiple inductors , but the available energy is so small that the details are not important .",
    "this approach is standard and useful , but the energy extracted is not under control for any given collision , and sometimes may be much larger than desirable .",
    "recently it has been proposed  @xcite to use highly excited rydberg atoms as an interaction medium , since the cross section for modest energy losses is enhanced relative to more inelastic collisions .",
    "in addition to the statistical advantage in measuring the signal , a substantial gain in background suppression can also be expected with electron tagging .",
    "the background suppression is based on the principle that a signal in the detector is placed in delayed coincidence with a signal from the tagger , within a time window of width @xmath204 .",
    "given a sufficiently low expected rate of tagger signals @xmath205 , and neglecting pile - up , random coincidences would result in background reduction by a factor @xmath206 with    @xmath207    too high a rate of tagger signals , either due to a high flux of incoming electrons or to a high noise level , would impair the measurement . however , in a dual - spectrometer setup like katrin",
    ", the electron flux through the tagger can be reduced by the pre - spectrometer down to @xmath208(@xmath209 hz ) .",
    "on the other hand , electrons can be trapped between the pre- and main spectrometer , and would give rise to a high rate of tagger signals .",
    "trapped electrons , however , could be reduced by an active measure such as a scanning wire @xcite or suitably chosen time - dependent perturbations of the electric fields along the transport path .",
    "the tagger must be placed before the main spectrometer , but should be placed in a low rate area . for best tagger functionality , it is also favorable to have the beam tube through the tagger fill a small area .",
    "the highest - field region of the 4.5 t magnet between the pre - spectrometer and main spectrometer is a good position ; there magnetic reflection reduces the flux through the tagger even below the rate at the pre - spectrometer analyzing plane .",
    "there are two major sources of electrons at this point in the beam line .",
    "* electrons from the source that make it through the pre - spectrometer , are reflected by the retarding potential at the main spectrometer analysing plane , and then go back through the pre - spectrometer and are absorbed in the source section .",
    "these will each pass the electron tagger twice .",
    "* electrons from the source that make it through the pre - spectrometer , are reflected by the main spectrometer , but , because of radiative losses or scattering inside the main spectrometer , lack the energy to make it back through the pre - spectrometer and become trapped .",
    "the rate of electrons becoming trapped is only @xmath208(@xmath210 hz ) , but , without any active removal method each trapped electron could pass the electron tagger millions of times before becoming undetectable .",
    "an active removal method only needs to remove trapped electrons in @xmath208(@xmath211 passes ) before the rate from trapped electrons is lower than the rate from electrons reflected by the main spectrometer retarding potential .",
    "electrons from the source that pass both the pre - spectrometer retarding potential , and the magnet , each make two passes .    from equation ( [ eq : pinch ] ) applied to the pre - spectrometer , we find the magnet at the end of the pre - spectrometer reflects all electrons with a starting angle at the source greater than :    @xmath212    where @xmath41 is the magnetic field in the magnet at the end of the pre - spectrometer .",
    "solving equation ( [ eq_p2c2 ] ) for @xmath16 and requiring that the parallel momentum @xmath213 must be positive to make it past the retarding potential , we find the minimum initial kinetic energy for passage through the pre - spectrometer is given by :    @xmath214    @xmath215 where @xmath122 is the starting angle at the source , @xmath75 is the retarding potential of the pre - spectrometer , and @xmath216 is the magnetic field at the analysing plane of the pre - spectrometer .    combining equations ( [ eq : thpre ] ) and ( [ eq : emin ] ) we find the average rate of electrons from the pre - spectrometer passing the electron tagger is :    @xmath217    where @xmath218 is the rate at the source , given by equation ( [ eq_betaeloss ] ) .",
    "the factor 2 has been applied since each electron makes two passes .",

    "however , as a practical matter , no satisfactory method has yet been identified that allows a controlled and sufficiently large amount of energy to be extracted from the electron .",
    "the cyclotron - emission method may be adequately sensitive , but significantly longer superconducting magnets providing a very homogeneous field are needed at the tagger position , which are not available between the katrin spectrometers . with a successful tagger , there is the potential for suppression of backgrounds by virtue of the coincidence requirement between the electron tagger and the focal - plane detector , but there is also a random trigger rate for the tagger caused by electrons that do not pass through the main spectrometer .",

    "[ fig : numasseshighpotential ] ) and becomes washed out if the time resolution of the tof measurement method exceeds some 100 ns .    assuming the background level in the tof mode is the same as in the standard mode where it is specified for katrin as @xmath221{mhz}$ ] , it can be shown that the improvement by the tof mode is still up to a factor 3 in terms of @xmath55 .",

    "the background dependence can be determined to be approximately @xmath223 @xcite , in reasonable agreement with the analytically approximated formula of @xmath224 @xcite .",
    "a method that has been discussed and successfully applied for tof in the past is to periodically cut off the electron flux @xcite . while there it has been used as a band - pass filter , where all signals with a tof outside a certain time window have been rejected and a classic , non - integrated beta spectrum has been measured , this technique might as well be applied for tof spectroscopy . in the case of katrin , periodic filtering",
    "could be achieved by a high - frequency modulation of the source or the pre - spectrometer potential .",
    "the principle in this case is to switch between two settings . in one setting a pre - spectrometer potential @xmath225",

    "<S> the katrin experiment aims at a measurement of the neutrino mass with a 90 % c.l . </S>",
    "<S> sensitivity of 0.2 ev / c@xmath0 by measuring the endpoint region of the tritium @xmath1 decay spectrum from a windowless gaseous molecular tritium source using an integrating spectrometer of the mac - e - filter type . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the idea of using the mac - e - filter in a time - of - flight mode ( mac - e - tof ) in which the neutrino mass is determined by a measurement of the electron time - of - flight ( tof ) spectrum that depends on the neutrino mass . </S>",
    "<S> mac - e - tof spectroscopy here is a very sensitive method since the @xmath1-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable velocities by the mac - e - filter . </S>",
    "<S> their velocity depends strongly on their surplus energy above the electric retarding potential . using mac - e - tof , </S>",
    "<S> a statistical sensitivity gain is expected . because a small number of retarding - potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement , in contrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard mac - e - filter mode </S>",
    "<S> , there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical power . </S>",
    "<S> the improvement of the statistical uncertainty of the squared neutrino mass has been determined by monte carlo simulation to be a factor 5 for an ideal case neglecting background and timing uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , two scenarios to determine the time - of - flight of the @xmath1-electrons are discussed , which use the katrin detector for creating the stop signal and different methods for obtaining a start signal . </S>",
    "<S> these comprise the hypothetical case of an ` electron tagger ' which detects passing electrons with minimal interference and the more realistic case of ` gated filtering ' , where the electron flux is periodically cut off by pulsing the pre - spectrometer potential . </S>"
