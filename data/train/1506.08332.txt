    "the exact cpt invariance implies the identity of the lifetime of a particle and its charge conjugate .",
    "therefore , when the individual partial decay widths of cp conjugate channels are different , due to the cp violation ( cpv ) , the other channels must have equal amount of cp violation , with opposite sign , such that the total width of the particle and antiparticle are equal .",
    "final state interaction must be the responsible to distribute the cp asymmetry among the different conjugate decay channels such as the sum of partial widths provides identical total width for the particle and its anti - particle .",
    "the common belief says that cpt invariance is not a practical constraint to be taken into account when computing cp violation in charmless @xmath0 decays .",
    "it is naively expected that cp violation is distributed among several different coupled final state channels with two , three , four and more hadrons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cpt constraint should be realized , in principle , by summing up over many hadronic decay channels .",

    "the common believe , we shown in detail in a previous paper  @xcite , that the coupling between several final states must be suppressed at least in some charmless three body @xmath0 decays .",
    "a quick observation to the event distribution of these decays shows that they are placed basically at the boundary of the dalitz plot , in a region dominated by light two - body resonances .",
    "this dominance can be directly associated with the non - perturbative regime at the @xmath0 mass energy  @xcite .",
    "in addition , by considering the observations made by early experiments  @xcite that the low mass @xmath7 and @xmath11 region is dominated by the elastic regime , the number of coupled channel expected for charmless three - body @xmath0 decays should be very restricted .",
    "there is a significant exception to this general picture for the two - body mass distribution : the s - wave @xmath3 re - scattering process between @xmath12 to @xmath8  gev  @xcite , that was also discussed in detail in our previous paper .",
    "so , at least for this class of decays , the existence of few possibilities of coupled hadronic channels demands the explicit consideration of the important constraint from cpt invariance in the study of cp violation .",
    "unfortunately little is known , either theoretically or experimentally , about the event distribution for others coupled channels with four or more hadrons in the final state .",
    "however , by looking at the profusion of observed low mass vector - vector charmless @xmath0 decays , it seems that they are also dominated by low mass resonances  @xcite .",
    "the inclusive cp asymmetry recently released by the lhcb collaboration for four charged @xmath0 charmless three - body decays , gives a hint about the correlation among the asymmetries in the coupled decay channels  @xcite .",

    ", three - body decays allow to observe this asymmetry in the dalitz phase - space . in principle",
    ", we can expect cp violation in charmless three - body @xmath0 decays coming from three different types of interferences involving weak and strong phases : ( i ) direct cpv due to the interference of the tree and penguin amplitudes in the same intermediate state .",
    "this first kind of cpv is based in the bss model  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) cp asymmetry produced through the interference between two different final states with different weak phases coupled by the final state interaction .",

    "this third cpv kind has been pointed out in previous theoretical .",
    "the present study addresses the three types of dynamics related with cpv in the dalitz plot discussed above and , more specifically , we look for signatures involving each one of these contributions in the charmless decay channels @xmath19 , @xmath6 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . to perform this study ,",
    "we use the recently published lhcb paper  @xcite , in particular , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mass distribution from the difference between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the two amplitude model constituted by the resonances @xmath72 and @xmath2 , shows two zeros in the cp asymmetry from the real part of the breit - wigners : one close to the @xmath72 mass and another one close to the @xmath2 mass .",
    "however , the term which mixes the real and imaginary parts of the breit - wigners does not present a clear signature of cp violation around the @xmath72 meson mass , while a zero is present at the @xmath2 mass , because the ratio @xmath263 is considerably larger than one . in both examples ,",
    "the zero s of the asymmetry at the resonance mass are associated only with the dalitz cp violation from the interference of two amplitudes and the real part of the breit - wigner , the contributions associated with the imaginary part present a behavior with a maximum at the resonances masses .",
    "the recent experimental results  @xcite are strongly indicating that the cp asymmetry appearing in the low @xmath260 mass region comes from the real part of the breit - wigners in the interference between two amplitudes involving the @xmath1 meson resonance .",
    "in addition , the cp asymmetries in whole kinematical region below @xmath264  gev in @xmath19 and @xmath26 decays demand the coupling to the @xmath265 by the strong interaction , as has already been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . to account for that",
    ", we introduced in the fitting of the cpv , the contribution of the coupled @xmath7 to @xmath100 channels in isoscalar and zero angular states .",
    "this was relevant for the fitting above the @xmath100 threshold .",
    "the independent confirmation of the cp asymmetry flowing between different channels coupled by the strong interaction was checked by the fair reproduction of the cpv in @xmath30 and @xmath10 distributions .",
    "the computation of the asymmetry was performed as dictated by the cpt constraint applied to coupled channels .",
    "there was no new parameters beyond those given in the fitting of the cp asymmetry data in the @xmath266 and @xmath20 decays .",
    "we discussed improvements to cp asymmetry formula beyond the one used to fit the experimental data on decay , where the interference between the resonances and elastic scattering terms are missing .",
    "the inclusion of the interference between the @xmath249wave @xmath7 scattering amplitude and the @xmath72 meson breit - wigner should improve the fit below the @xmath267 . in this particular region , the @xmath250 , namely the @xmath251 , will be taken into account through the elastic @xmath7 scattering , which it is expected to improve the fit .",
    "still the bose symmetrization of the amplitude by the exchange of the identical pions has to be considered , which should be addressed in the future .",
    "finally , the results of our fittings suggest an important consequence to cp violation : the strong phases can come from the hadronic interaction minimizing the effect of the imaginary part of penguin contributions to both decays studied here , as the recent experimental results are indicating .",
