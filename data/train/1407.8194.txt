    "@xcite , but our proof for three agents is already quite involved and seems hard to generalize . it remains open whether the partition - based strategy is optimal for four and five ( unweighted ) agents .",
    "we considered the patrolling problem in one of its most basic forms : the terrain to be patrolled is a line segment , every point in the terrain must be visited , and each agent is a point with a maximum speed .",

    "@xcite study the setting where agents can move faster when walking without watching ( although their problem is to cover the line segment just once , rather than patrolling perpetually ) .    for practical purposes ,",
    "it is important to consider decentralized settings where agents need to cooperate with limited global knowledge or computational power  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the partition - based strategy is not always optimal may be bad news in this context , since it is one of the simplest strategies to be realized in a distributed way , using systems of self - stabilizing robots , e.g. , in models of `` bouncing robots ''  @xcite .",
    "thus a natural question to ask next is whether and how movements better than the partition - based strategy can be realized in various distributed settings .",
    "since the partition - based strategy covers each @xmath208 \\times [ 1 , \\infty)$ ] only doubly , it achieves a @xmath58-approximation ( for the problem of finding the longest possible fence that can be patrolled ) . that is , no strategy patrols a fence longer than @xmath209 ( in the unweighted setting ) .",
