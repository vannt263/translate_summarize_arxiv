    "we propose a new model , for seyfert galaxies , involving a point source of relativistic leptons located above the disk ( that could be physically realized by a strong shock terminating an aborted jet ) emitting hard radiation by inverse compton ( ic ) process on soft photons produced by the accretion disk .",
    "the disk itself radiates only through the re - processing of the hard radiation impinging on it , i.e. we do not suppose any internal energy dissipation ( cf fig .",
    "[ main ] ) .",
    "such a geometry is highly anisotropic , which takes a real importance in the computation of ic process ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we treat both newtonian and general relativistic cases @xcite , deriving a self - consistent solution in the newtonian case .",
    "we have recently added monte - carlo calculations to take into account , in the high energy part of our synthetic spectra , the compton reflection component and the fluorescent iron line @xcite .",
    "we present here the most important results supplied by the model .",
    "it appears that the anisotropy of the soft photon field at the hot source level , leads to an * anisotropic inverse compton process * , with much more radiation being scattered backward than forward .",
    "such an anisotropic re - illumination could naturally explain the apparent x - ray luminosity , usually much lower than the optical - uv continuum emitted in the blue bump @xcite .",
    "it can also explain the equivalent width observed for the iron line , which requires more impinging radiation than what is actually observed @xcite .",
    "we plot in figure [ anisotropytemperature ] the angular distribution of the power emitted by the hot source in newtonian metrics and for different values of the source height in kerr metrics .",
    "it appears that the closer the source to the black hole is , the less anisotropic the high energy photon field is .",
    "this is principally due to the curvature of geodesics making the photons emitted near the black hole arrive at larger angle than in the newtonian case .",
    "the radiative balance between the hot source and the disk allows to compute the temperature profile on the disk surface .",
    "it is , in fact , markedly different from `` standard accretion disk model '' as shown in figure [ anisotropytemperature ] . indeed , even if at large distances , all models give the same asymptotic behavior @xmath1 , in the inner part of the disk , it keeps increasing in `` standard model '' whereas , in our model , for @xmath2 , the * temperature saturates * around a characteristic value @xmath3 .",
    "the differences between newtonian and kerr metrics come only from gravitational and doppler shifts , which are only appreciable for @xmath4 .",
    "the overall uv to x - ray spectra can be deduced from this model .",
    "the bulk of the energy coming from the disk gives the well - known `` blue - bump '' . on the other hand , in order to avoid run - away electrons , the relativistic particle distribution is supposed to be a * power law with an exponential cut - off * about 300 kev , giving the high energy part of the spectrum .",
    "one can see on figures [ specangzovar]a newtonian spectra for different inclination angles for @xmath5 .",
    "for all inclination angles , the kerr spectra are always weaker in uv and brighter in x - ray than the newtonian ones .",
    "these effects are much less pronounced for high @xmath6 values because the emission area is much larger , and thus is less affected by relativistic corrections .",
    "figure [ specangzovar]b shows the overall spectrum , for different values of @xmath6 in kerr metrics for @xmath7 .",
    "the relativistic effects become important for values of @xmath6 smaller than about @xmath8 .",
    "they produce a variation of intensity lowering the blue - bump and increasing the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the change in the uv range is due to the transverse doppler effect between the rotating disk and the observer , producing a net red - shift . in the x - ray range ,",
    "the variation is due to the high energy dependence on @xmath6 ( cf figure [ anisotropytemperature ] ) .",
    "the observed * x / uv ratio * can then be strongly altered by these effects .",
    "quantitatively , the luminosity ratio between the maximum of the blue - bump and the x - ray plateau goes from @xmath9 in the newtonian case , to @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "with some further assumptions , the model predicts scaling laws quite different from the standard accretion models .",
    "if one assumes a constant high energy cut - off ( possibly fixed by the pair production threshold ) and a constant solid angle subtended by the hot source , then the following mass scaling laws apply : @xmath12 the first equality could explain the weak variations of the blue bump component , even though the luminosity l ranges over 6 orders of magnitude from source to source @xcite .",
    "the second one is in agreement with the results of @xcite where they find in a sample of seyfert i and quasars a correlation between the mass and the luminosity under the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "we considered an infinite disc of neutral matter with solar abondances ( opacities given by @xcite ) , and hydrogen column density of @xmath15 .",
    "we found that about 10 % of the total energy emitted toward the disc is reflected and does not contribute to the disc heating .",
    "however , the reflection component has important effects on the shape of the observed spectrum . due to the strong anisotropy of the primary source",
    ", the ratio of the reflected to the primary component can be very high .",
    "the spectrum strongly depends on the viewing angle @xmath16 with respect to the disc normal . for nearly edge on inclinations ,",
    "the reflection contribution is weak . as the inclination decrease the reflection component increase @xcite .",
    "conversely , the primary spectrum decreases with decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "so that , for a face on inclination , reflection dominates the hard x - ray spectrum . a rough comparison to ic4329a and ngc 4151 spectra shows that our model is reasonnably close to the data if the orientation is nearly edge - on ( cf . fig [ reflection ] ) .",
    "we can note that the anisotropic illumination model predicts a weak uv component for high inclination angles which is in qualitative agreement with the observed uv to soft x - ray luminosity ratio in these two objects .",
