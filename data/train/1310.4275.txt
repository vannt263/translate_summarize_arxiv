    "one of the most salient issues in modern physics is the quantum phase transition as a function of tuning parameters  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have focused on the electron - electron correlation as a tuning parameter , which can induce quantum phase transitions to various emergent states of matter including the fractional quantum hall state , high - temperature superconductor , and mott insulator . with great advances in nanoscience",
    "@xcite as well as cold atom physics  @xcite , quantum phase transitions in nonequilibrium conditions , for example , via application of a large electric field  @xcite or illumination of an intense radiation  @xcite , are attracting more and more intensive attentions . while a systematic understanding of the nonequilibrium quantum phase transition is elusive at present , studying the nonequilibrium steady state of the electric - field - driven mott insulator , especially in two or higher dimensions  @xcite , provides an important stepping stone to achieve such a goal , revealing a new possibility for emergent nonequilibrium steady states of matter , which are induced by strong correlation in a highly nonequilibrium situation .    under the expectation that the mott insulator eventually undergoes a phase transition(s ) to metal at a sufficiently large electric field  @xcite , the central issue of the electric - field - driven mott insulator is exactly how this phase transition , also known as the dielectric breakdown , should occur .",
    "one possibility is that the electric field induces some kind of charge transfer from one region of the system to another so that the mott insulating region is effectively doped .",
    "we are interested in a more fundamental possibility that the dielectric breakdown occurs through the nonlinear response of the system keeping the spatial uniformity .",
    "constructing an accurate , microscopic theory for the nonlinear response , however , is a highly challenging problem since it requires going beyond the well - established linear response theory , which is rigorously formulated in terms of the kubo formula .    to address this issue , in this work , we analyze the electric - field - driven mott insulator by using the keldysh - floquet dmft , which can capture both effects of strong correlation and large electric field with arbitrary strengths .",
    "the floquet formulation of the keldysh dmft provides a convenient platform for the direct analysis of the steady state , which is contrasted to real - time formulations  @xcite , where the full time evolution of the system is considered along the keldysh contour , requiring high computational costs to achieve the true steady - state limit . in our formulation ,",
    "the fully - interacting green s functions in the steady - state limit are directly connected with the noninteracting counterparts via the keldysh - dyson equation embedded in the keldysh - floquet dmft self - consistency loop .",
    "a crucial breakthrough in this work is that the noninteracting green s functions are determined in terms of the exact energy eigenstates , called the wsl eigenstates .",
    "it is important to note that the total energy ( which is the sum of the kinetic and the electric potential energy ) is still conserved under a static electric field .",
    "the corresponding energy eigenstates of the noninteracting system are the wsl eigenstates , whose precise mathematical form is obtained in this work via exact diagonalization .",
    "more importantly , it is shown by using the markovian quantum master equation that the wsl eigenstates are individually thermalized via the standard canonical ensemble .",
    "the markovian quantum master equation , or the _ lindblad _ equation , is derived under the assumption that ( i ) the system is coupled to a boson bath , which is already in thermal equilibrium , ( ii ) the system - bath coupling is sufficiently weak so that the density matrix for the whole system can be approximated as a direct product between the individual density matrix of the system and bath , and ( iii ) the dynamics of the system forgets its past history rapidly , which is also known as the markovian condition .",
    "determined by this thermalization scheme , which we call the wsl - wise thermalization , the noninteracting lesser green s function is plugged into the keldysh - floquet dmft self - consistency loop as a key piece of the input information .",
    "now , it is worth mentioning that an essentially identical thermalization scheme to the above , where the wsl eigenstates are essential , has been used for the semiconductor superlattice problem  @xcite , while not for the problem of the electric - field - driven mott insulator . in early stages of the study on the latter problem ,",
    "the role of the thermalization was not clearly understood so that many studies were devoted to the closed system , which is completely decoupled from the environment  @xcite .",
    "a necessity of the proper thermalization for the open system was addressed initially by joura and collaborators  @xcite , who introduced an approximate ansatz on the density matrix .",
    "later , numerous efforts have been made to solve the keldysh - dyson equation in a direct manner for appropriately chosen system - bath coupling terms , which can be categorized into two classes : ( i ) coupling with an external fermion bath ( which is not influenced by the electric field )  @xcite , and ( ii ) coupling with a boson bath composed of a single phonon mode  @xcite .",
    "the fermion - bath model is inspired by a mesoscopic transport problem of the small normal - metal ring penetrated by a time - dependent magnetic field ( which induces an electromotive force along the circumference of the ring )  @xcite .",
    "while providing reasonable dissipation effects , a fictitious fermion bath introduced in the fermion - bath model holds no direct relationship with the actual dissipating environment existing in condensed matter .",
    "a more realistic bath model can be obtained via coupling with a boson bath , particularly , composed of phonons . despite being more realistic , however , previous works using the boson - bath model suffer from a serious problem that the boson bath is composed of only a single phonon mode ( for that matter , any finite number of modes ) , which , according to the poincar recurrence theorem  @xcite , means that the system will return to the initial state eventually in a sufficiently long time , i.  e. , there is no dissipation . to overcome this problem",
    ", one has to consider a boson bath composed of infinitely many phonon modes with a continuous energy spectrum . in this work ,",
    "we use the caldeira - leggett model , which represents the boson bath as a continuous set of infinitely many quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "the markovian quantum master equation is derived from the caldeira - leggett model with help of the markovian condition combined with several other approximations .    as a result of the keldysh - floquet dmft , which uses the noninteracting green s functions as an input to the self - consistency loop",
    ", it is shown that the electric - field - driven mott insulator undergoes a sequence of two phase transitions to metal with the first induced by a coherent reconstruction of the mid - gap state within the mott gap and the second by an incoherent tunneling through the biased hubbard bands .",
    "the reconstructed mid - gap state generates its own emergent wsl structure with a reduced effective electric field , as if strong correlation is renormalized away with exchange of the electric field .",
    "the two metallic phases are mediated by a reentrant insulating phase , which is characterized by the population inversion , causing instability toward inhomogeneous current density states at weak electron - impurity scattering .",

    "<S> in this work , we explore the possibility of emergent nonequilibrium steady states arising from the electric - field - driven mott insulator via the keldysh - floquet dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , which can determine the fully - interacting , nonequilibrium steady - state green s functions with the noninteracting counterparts as an input to the dmft self - consistency loop . unlike the retarded component , obtaining the lesser green s function for the noninteracting system presents an important obstacle since the thermalization of the noninteracting system still requires a precise understanding of the dissipation mechanism . a crucial breakthrough in this work </S>",
    "<S> is that the noninteracting lesser green s function can be determined in terms of the wannier - stark ladder ( wsl ) eigenstates , which are thermalized via the standard canonical ensemble according to the markovian quantum master equation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the intricate interplay between strong correlation and large electric field can generate a sequence of two dielectric breakdowns with the first induced by a coherent reconstruction of the mid - gap state within the mott gap and the second by an incoherent tunneling through the biased hubbard bands . </S>",
    "<S> it is predicted that the reconstructed mid - gap state generates its own emergent wsl structure with a reduced effective electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the two dielectric breakdowns are mediated by a reentrant insulating phase , which is characterized by the population inversion , causing instability toward inhomogeneous current density states at weak electron - impurity scattering . </S>"
