    "the aim of this note is to demonstrate that such an important quantity as the hard pomeron intercept ( which governs the behavior of hadronic cross - sections at ultra - high energies ) can be extracted from the experimental data directly and , as well , to provide an explicit estimation of the corresponding value .",
    "the @xmath1 total cross - section @xmath2 is related to the proton unpolarized structure function @xmath3 @xcite through the well - known formula @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath7 is the proton mass , @xmath8 is the invariant mass of the produced hadronic state , and @xmath9 is the incoming photon virtuality .",
    "our reasoning is grounded on the phenomenological fact that in the lepton - proton deep inelastic scattering there is a wide kinematic range wherein @xmath2 can be satisfactorily described by means of a simple power expression : @xmath10 where @xmath11 gev , @xmath12 is some unknown function of @xmath9 , and @xmath13 depends neither on @xmath9 nor on @xmath8 .",
    "the description details are presented in figs .",

    "the description quality is @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( 2 outlying points within the considered kinematic range were excluded from the fitting procedure , see tab . [ out ] ) .",

    "for exploration of the @xmath8-behavior of @xmath2 in the region @xmath17 the regge formalism @xcite is useful ( treating @xmath3 from the regge phenomenology standpoint is not a new idea , _",
    "e.g. _ see @xcite ) . in the framework of this formalism",
    ", we can represent the @xmath1 total cross - section ( proportional , according to the optical theorem , to the imaginary part of the forward amplitude ) in the following form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hard pomeron intercept , @xmath20 are the hard pomeron form - factors of the colliding particles at the zero of the transferred momentum , and `` ... '' in the right - hand side corresponds to the combined contribution of regge cuts and secondary poles . within the explored kinematic range these terms",
    "are conjectured to be subleading corrections only .",
    "the theoretical arguments in favor of this conjecture are considered in detail in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "below we just restrict ourselves by some qualitative phenomenological reasoning .",
    "-0.7 cm    the secondary reggeons make @xmath2 larger at lower energies and the absorptive corrections make @xmath2 smaller at higher energies .",
    "consequently , the combined effect of these terms is in tempering the growth rate of @xmath2 with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the relative contribution of secondary poles decreases at higher @xmath8 ( and , possibly , at higher @xmath9 ) .",
    "the relative contribution of regge cuts decreases at higher @xmath9 , owing to the fact that the reggeon effective couplings to @xmath21 should weaken at higher @xmath9 due to asymptotic freedom . in such circumstances , at high enough values of the incoming photon virtuality and the @xmath1 collision energy these corrections",
    "could be neglected and , hence , the @xmath8-behavior of @xmath2 becomes universal .",
    "in other words , at higher @xmath9 the growth rate of @xmath2 should tend from below to some constant value .",
    "this is the very pattern which takes place in experiment : the effective power @xmath22 , which characterizes the @xmath8-behavior of @xmath2 at high energies ( @xmath23 ) , grows from @xmath24 at low @xmath9 to @xmath25 at @xmath26 60 gev@xmath27 .",
    "thus , the universal parameter @xmath13 in expression ( [ power ] ) can be associated with the hard pomeron intercept : @xmath28 .",
    "note , that this purely phenomenological estimation is in agreement with the qualitative result obtained in the framework of the lo bfkl approximation , @xmath29 @xcite , though the lo bfkl restriction is affected by the higher order corrections @xcite .",
    "in other words , the value of @xmath19 presented above is roughly consistent with the bfkl expectations , though these are not sufficiently accurate for a firm conclusion to be made .",
    ".the quality of description of the data on the @xmath1 total cross - sections by means of expression ( [ power ] ) with @xmath30 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the proposed estimation is significantly lower than the hard pomeron intercept values presented in the more complicated reggeon models @xcite with some secondary - reggeon contributions taken into account ( @xmath31 ) and higher than the corresponding values presented in @xcite .",
    "however , these values were obtained through fitting to the old hera data and they do not provide a satisfactory description of the higher - quality data @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , it would be appropriate to repeat the phenomenological arguments why the above - presented estimation of power @xmath13 in ( [ power ] ) , obtained via fitting to the data on the @xmath1 total cross - section in the region 60 gev@xmath32 gev@xmath27 , should be associated with the hard pomeron intercept .",
    "* the very fact that expression ( [ power ] ) with universal @xmath13 provides a satisfactory description of the data within such a wide kinematic range is an undisguised hint about the adequacy of this simple approximation .",
    "* at higher @xmath9 the effective growth rate of @xmath2 tends to some constant value from below .",
    "such an evolution is in accordance with the fact that in the presence of some hard scale the comparative contribution of absorptive corrections decreases due to the effect of asymptotic freedom .",
    "as the hard pomeron is , presumably , the leading reggeon , with the highest regge trajectory in the scattering region , so the hard - pomeron exchanges are expected to dominate in diffractive ( small - angle ) scattering of hadrons at ultra - high energies .",
    "therefore , more or less precise estimation of the hard pomeron intercept is absolutely necessary for raising the predictive efficiency of the models describing the energy evolution of the corresponding cross - sections ( for more detailed discussion , see , for example , @xcite or @xcite ) ."
