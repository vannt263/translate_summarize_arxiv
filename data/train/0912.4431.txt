    "the ground state consists of spins on three sublattices forming 120@xmath13 angles with respect to each other , the @xmath17 spin structure . because there are two senses to the spin helicity , the ground state has a twofold discrete degeneracy as well as an xy - like continuous degeneracy .",
    "consequently , it is predicted to undergo two phase transitions , one associated with ising - type symmetry breaking and the other with a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) mechanism.@xcite note that our system has an incommensurate spin structure close to @xmath18 spin structure ( see later ) . in this sence",
    "our system is different from an ideal 2d @xmath1 antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice .",

    "a short range spin order related to the incommensurate spin structure ( typically @xmath19 in - plane spin correlation length ) appears below 5 k , and remains unchanged even below @xmath5 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the result of specific heat measurement of stage-2 mncl@xmath0 gic between 0.45 k and 50 k , with and without an external magnetic field applied along the @xmath3 plane .",
    "we show that the magnetic specific heat shows no anomaly at @xmath5 , but exhibits a broad peak around 5 k. it also shows a broad peak around 41 k , which is the onset of short range spin correlation .",
    "there is a relatively large residual entropy at @xmath4 = 0 k reflecting the fully frustrated nature of the system .",

    "( v ) the entropy due to the broad peak around 13 k is 1/3 of the total entropy . it is surprising that in spite of difference in the detail of magnetic and structural parameters , the magnetic behavior of stage-2 mncl@xmath0 gic is very similar to that of niga@xmath0s@xmath20 .",
    "this may imply that these common features are a key to understanding the physics of 2d @xmath1-like or heisenberg - like antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice .",
    "the sample of stage-2 mncl@xmath0 gic was prepared from kish graphite by vapor reaction of the powdered mncl@xmath0 in a chlorine - gas atmosphere of 740 torr .",

    "<S> the entropy due to the broad peak around 5 k is 1/3 of the total entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the residual entropy is 63 % of the total entropy because of highly frustrated nature of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic neutron scattering indicates that a short range spin order associated with the incommensurate wave vector @xmath10 ( @xmath11 at 0.45 k ) appears below 5 k and remains unchanged down to 63 mk . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane spin correlation length is only 18 @xmath2 at 0.45 k. the low temperature phase below @xmath5 is a kind of reentrant spin glass phase where the spin glass phase coexists with a short range spin order associated with @xmath10 . </S>"
