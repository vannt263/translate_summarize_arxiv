    "monotone subsequences in a permutation @xmath0 has been the subject of vigorous research for over sixty years . in this paper , we will review three different lines of work . in all of them",
    ", we will consider increasing subsequences of a permutation of length @xmath1 that have a _ fixed _",
    "length @xmath2 .",
    "this is in contrast to another line of work , started by ulam more than sixty years ago , in which the distribution of the _ longest _ increasing subsequence of a random permutation has been studied . that direction of research has recently reached a high point in the article @xcite of baik , deift and johansson .",
    "the three directions we consider are distinguished by their definition of monotone subsequences .",
    "we can simply require that @xmath2 entries of a permutation increase from left to right , or we can in addition require that these @xmath2 entries be in consecutive positions , or we can even require that in they be consecutive integers _ and _ be in consecutive positions .",
    "the classic definition of pattern avoidance for permutations is as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a permutation , let @xmath3 , and let @xmath4 be another permutation .",
    "we say that @xmath5 _ contains _ @xmath6 as a pattern if there exists a subsequence @xmath7 so that for all indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the inequality @xmath10 holds if and only if the inequality @xmath11 holds .",
    "if @xmath5 does not contain @xmath6 , then we say that @xmath5 _ avoids _ @xmath6 . in other words",
    ", @xmath5 contains @xmath6 if @xmath5 has a subsequence of entries , not necessarily in consecutive positions , which relate to each other the same way as the entries of @xmath6 do .",
    "the permutation 3174625 contains the pattern 123 .",
    "indeed , consider the first , fourth , and seventh entries .",
    "in particular , @xmath5 contains the monotone pattern @xmath12 if and only if @xmath5 contains an increasing subsequence of length @xmath2 .",
    "the elements of this increasing subsequence do not have to be in consecutive positions .",
    "the enumeration of permutations avoiding a given pattern is a fascinating subject .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the number of permutations of length @xmath1 ( or , in what follows , @xmath1-permutations ) that avoid the pattern @xmath6 .      among patterns of length three , there is no difference between the monotone pattern and other patterns as far as @xmath13 is concerned .",
    "this is the content of our first theorem .",
    "[ allsix ] let @xmath6 be any pattern of length three , and let @xmath1 be any positive integer",
    ". then @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , @xmath13 is the @xmath1th catalan number .",
    "if @xmath5 avoids @xmath6 , then the reverse of @xmath5 avoids the reverse of @xmath6 , and the complement of @xmath5 avoids the complement of @xmath6",
    ". therefore , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the fact that @xmath17 is proved using the well - known simion - schmidt bijection @xcite . in a permutation , let us call an entry a _ left - to - right _ minimum if it is smaller than every entry on its left .",
    "for instance , the left - to - right minima of 4537612 are the entries 4 , 3 , and 1 .",
    "take an @xmath1-permutation @xmath5 of length @xmath1 that avoids 132 , keep its left - to - right minima fixed , and arrange all other entries in decreasing order in the positions that do not belong to left - to - right minima , to get the permutation @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath18 is a union of two decreasing sequences , so it is 123-avoiding .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 is a bijection between the two relevant set of permutations . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath9 is a permutation counted by @xmath22 , then @xmath23 is obtained by keeping the left - to - right minima of @xmath9 fixed , and rearranging the remaining entries so that moving from left to right , each slot is filled by the smallest remaining entry that is larger than the closest left - to - right minimum on the left of that position .    in order to prove that @xmath24 ,",
    "just note that in a 132-avoiding @xmath1-permutation , any entry to the left of @xmath1 must be smaller than any entry to the right of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath1 is in the @xmath25th position , then there are @xmath26 permutations of length @xmath1 that avoid 132 . summing over all @xmath25",
    ", we get the recurrence @xmath27 which is the well - known recurrence for catalan numbers .",
    "when we move to longer patterns , the situation becomes much more complicated and less well understood . in his doctoral thesis",
    "@xcite , julian west published the following numerical evidence .    * for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , we have 1 , 2 , 6 , 23 , 103 , 512 , 2740 , 15485 * for @xmath30 , and @xmath29 , we have 1 , 2 , 6 , 23 , 103 , 513 , 2761 , 15767 * for @xmath31 , and @xmath29 , we have 1 , 2 , 6 , 23 , 103 , 513 , 2762 , 15793 .",
    "these data are startling for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the numbers @xmath13 are no longer independent of @xmath6 ; there are some patterns of length four that are easier to avoid than others .",
    "second , the monotone pattern 1234 , special as it is , does not provide the minimum or the maximum value for @xmath13 .",
    "we point out that for each @xmath6 of the other 21 patterns of length four , it is known that the sequence @xmath13 is identical to one of the three sequences @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "see @xcite , chapter 4 , for more details .",
    "exact formulas are known for two of the above three sequences . for the monotone pattern ,",
    "ira gessel gave a formula using symmetric functions .",
    "@xcite , @xcite for all positive integers @xmath1 , the identity @xmath32    the formula for @xmath28 is due to the present author @xcite , and is quite surprising .",
    "[ exactf ] for all positive integers @xmath1 , we have @xmath33    this result is unexpected for two reasons .",
    "first , it shows that @xmath28 is not simply less than @xmath30 for every @xmath34 ; it is _ much less _ , in a sense that we will explain in subsection [ swlimits ] . for",
    "now , we simply state that while @xmath30 is `` roughly '' @xmath35 , the value of @xmath28 is``roughly '' @xmath36 .",
    "second , the formula is , in some sense , simpler than that for @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , it follows from theorem [ exactf ] that the ordinary generating function of the sequence @xmath28 is @xmath37 this is an _ algebraic _ power series . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known ( problem plus 5.10 in @xcite that the ordinary generating function of the sequence @xmath30 is _ not _ algebraic .",
    "so permutations avoiding the monotone pattern are not even the _ nicest _ among permutations avoiding a given pattern , in terms of the generating functions that count them .",
    "there is no known formula for the third sequence , that of the numbers @xmath31 .",
    "however , the following inequality is known @xcite .    for all integers @xmath38 , the inequality @xmath39 holds .",
    "let us call an entry of a permutation a _",
    "right - to - left maximum _ if it is larger than all entries on its right .",
    "so let us say that two @xmath1-permutations are in the same class if they have the same left - to - right minima , and they are in the same positions , and they have the same right - to - left maxima , and they are in the same positions as well .",
    "for example , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are in the same class , but @xmath42 and @xmath43 are not , as the third entry of @xmath44 is not a left - to - right minimum , whereas that of @xmath45 is .",
    "it is straightforward to see that each non - empty class contains exactly one 1234-avoiding permutation , the one in which the subsequence of entries that are neither left - to - right minima nor right - to - left maxima is decreasing .    it is less obvious that each class contains _ at least one _ 1324-avoiding permutation .",
    "note that if a permutation contains a 1324-pattern , then we can choose such a pattern so that its first element is a left - to - right minimum and its last element is a right - to - left maximum .",
    "take a 1324-avoiding permutation , and take one of its 1324-patterns of the kind described in the previous sentence .",
    "interchange its second and third element .",
    "observe that this will keep the permutation within its original class .",
    "repeat this procedure as long as possible .",
    "the procedure will stop after a finite number of steps since each step decreases the number of inversions of the permutation .",
    "when the procedure stops , the permutation at hand avoids 1324 .",
    "this shows that @xmath46 for all @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath38 , then the equality can not hold since there is at least one class that contains more than one 1324-avoiding permutation . for @xmath47 ,",
    "this is the class @xmath48 , which contains 3612745 and 3416725 . for larger",
    "@xmath1 , this class can be prepended by @xmath49 to get a suitable class .",
    "it turns out again that @xmath31 is _ much _",
    "larger than @xmath30",
    ". we will give the details in subsection [ swlimits ] .",
    "for general @xmath2 , there are some good estimates known for the value of @xmath50 .",
    "the first one can be proved by an elementary method .",

    ", a @xmath6-avoiding permutation can be decomposed into the union of @xmath55 decreasing subsequences",
    ". clearly , there are at most @xmath56 ways to partition our @xmath1 entries into @xmath55 blocks .",
    "then we have to place these blocks of entries somewhere in our permutation .",
    "there are at most @xmath56 ways to assign each position of the permutation to one of these blocks , completing the proof .    indeed ,",
    "theorem [ 1rank ] has a stronger version , obtained by amitaj regev @xcite .",
    "it needs heavy analytic machinery , and therefore will not be proved here .",
    "we mention the result , however , as it shows that no matter what @xmath2 is , the constant @xmath57 in theorem [ 1rank ] can not be replaced by a smaller number , so the elementary estimate of theorem [ 1rank ] is optimal in some strong sense .",
    "we remind the reader that functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are said to be _ asymptotically equal _ if @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite for all patterns @xmath6 , there exists a constant @xmath66 so that @xmath67    it this not difficult to show using fekete s lemma that the sequence @xmath68 is monotone increasing .",
    "the previous theorem shows that it is bounded from above , leading to the following .",
    "[ limits ] for all patterns @xmath6 , the limit @xmath69 exists .",
    "the real number @xmath70 is called the _",
    "stanley - wilf _ limit , or _",
    "growth rate _ of the pattern @xmath6 . in this terminology ,",
    "theorem [ regev ] implies that @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , @xmath72 , while theorem [ exactf ] implies that @xmath73 .",
    "so it is not simply easier to avoid 1234 than 1342 , it is _ exponentially _ easier to do so .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that in the multiset of @xmath74 real numbers @xmath13 , the numbers @xmath50 are much closer to the maximum than to the minimum .",
    "this led to the plausible conjecture that for any pattern @xmath6 of length @xmath2 , the inequality @xmath75 holds .",
    "this would mean that while there are patterns of length @xmath2 that are easier to avoid than @xmath76 , there are none that are much easier to avoid , in the sense of stanley - wilf limits .",
    "however , this conjecture has been disproved by the following result of michael albert and al .",
    "@xcite the inequality @xmath77 holds .    in other words , it is not simply harder to avoid 1234 than 1324 , it is _ exponentially _ harder to do so .      in this section",
    "we change direction and prove that the distribution of the number of copies of @xmath76 in a randomly selected @xmath1-permutation converges in distribution to a normal distribution .",

    "see @xcite and its references for various proofs of that result , or @xcite for a generalization .",
    "we need to introduce some notation for transforms of the random variable @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 , let @xmath82 , and let @xmath83 mean that @xmath84 converges in distribution to the standard normal variable .    our main tool in this section will be a theorem of svante janson @xcite . in order to be able to state that theorem , we need the following definition",

    "since the set of entries of @xmath290 is an interval , and the set of entries of @xmath291 is an interval , it follows that the set of entries of @xmath296 is also an interval .",

    "the pattern of the leftmost @xmath297 entries of @xmath6 is identical to the pattern of the rightmost @xmath297 entries of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 satisfies both of these criteria , then two very tightly contained copies of @xmath6 in @xmath5 may indeed intersect .",
    "for example , the pattern @xmath301 satisfies both of the above criteria with @xmath302 , and indeed , 214365 very tightly contains two intersecting copies of @xmath6 , namely 2143 and 4365 .                      on the one hand , @xmath305 since the number of @xmath1-permutations very tightly containing @xmath25 copies of @xmath306 is at least as large as the number of @xmath1-permutations very tightly containing the pattern @xmath307 .",
    "the latter is at least as large as the number of @xmath1-permutations that very tightly contain a @xmath307-pattern in their first @xmath308 positions .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath309 this can be proved by noting that if @xmath310 is the @xmath25-element set of starting positions of @xmath25 ( necessarily disjoint ) very tight copies of @xmath6 in an @xmath1-permutation , and @xmath311 is the event that in a random permutation @xmath312 , the subsequence @xmath313 is a very tight @xmath6-subsequence for all @xmath314 , then @xmath315 .",

    "( of theorem [ poisson ] . )",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the poisson distribution ( with any parameter ) is determined by its moments , so the method of moments can be applied to prove convergence to a poisson distribution .",
    "let @xmath322 be the indicator random variable of the event that in a randomly selected @xmath1-permutation @xmath0 , the inequality @xmath323 .",
    "then @xmath324 , and the probability that @xmath5 has a very tight copy of @xmath76 for @xmath51 is @xmath325 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath326 where the @xmath327 are _ independent _ random variables and each of them takes value 0 with probability @xmath328 , and value 1 with probability @xmath329 .",
    "( see @xcite for more details . )",
    "the rightmost limit in the above displayed equation is not difficult to compute .",
    "let @xmath330 be a fixed non - negative integer .",
    "then the probability that exactly @xmath330 variables @xmath327 take value 1 is @xmath331 .",
    "once we know the @xmath330-element set of the @xmath327 that take value 1 , each of the @xmath332 strings of length @xmath8 formed from those @xmath330 variables contributes 1 to @xmath333 .",
    "summing over all @xmath330 , this proves that @xmath334 on the other hand , it is well - known that @xmath335 , the @xmath8th bell number , is also the @xmath8th moment of the poisson distribution with parameter 1 . comparing this to ( [ longone ] ) , we see that the sequence @xmath336 converges to the @xmath8th moment of the poisson distribution with parameter 1 .",
