    "the studies of quantum spin models are of great current interest .",
    "these studies help us in getting some understanding of the magnetic properties of the real , physical systems .",
    "studies of the magnetic properties described by the dimer ( or valence bond ) configurations has been a subject of continuing research activities , and is of particular interest recently .",
    "a recent example is the shastry - sutherland@xcite type models used in understanding the physical properties of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0@xcite .",
    "this system is a magnetic insulator with dimer ground state , which is topologically equivalent to that of the shastry - sutherland ( ss ) model .",
    "then there are studies related to the kagom antiferromagnet@xcite , where magnetic excitations are gapped , and this gap is filled with a large number of low - lying singlet excitations whose number grows as exponential in the number of sites .",
    "it is believed that the low - energy physics of the heisenberg antiferromagnet on kagom lattice is of the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) type .",
    "the quantum dimer models have been applied to study antiferromagnets on triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "again , the idea employed is that of resonating dimer coverings of the lattice .",
    "the idea of doping rvb ground state to achieve superconductivity has been a subject of great consideration in the context of high - t@xmath2 superconductors@xcite .",
    "though the low temperature behaviour of the undoped high - t@xmath2 materials does not show up rvb like magnetic properties , the idea is still interesting , and motivates the search for a doped rvb superconductor@xcite .",
    "all these studies clearly show the importance of understanding the physics governed by valence bond configurations .",
    "it makes the search for , and the studies of models with dimer ground state particularly desirable .",
    "the majumdar - ghosh ( mg ) model@xcite is a one dimensional quantum spin model with the nearest and next nearest neighbour exchange interactions .",
    "it is exactly solvable for a particular ratio of these exchange couplings , and has a two - fold degenerate dimer ground state .",
    "though this model has been studied for anisotropic exchange and general spin , @xmath3 , we will consider only isotropic exchange and @xmath4 case .",
    "the exact solution of the mg model guides us in constructing models with exact dimer ground states which is the subject of the present work .",
    "the hamiltonian for the mg model is written as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the number of sites in a one dimensional ( 1d ) lattice with periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) .",
    "it is a well studied model , and shows quantum phase transition from ordered phase to disordered , spin - liquid like phase as @xmath8 is increased from zero to some value greater than 0.482@xcite . at @xmath9 , and for @xmath7 being even ,",
    "the _ bond - singlet _ ( dimer ) configurations , as shown in fig.([dimers]-_a _ , [ dimers]-_b _ ) , form an exact , two - fold degenerate ground subspace .",
    "let us call these dimer configurations as @xmath10 and @xmath11 which are given below .",

    "the ground state energy , in units of the nearest neighbour exchange ( 2@xmath16 ) , is -@xmath17 .    in the following sections , we will discuss , briefly , why @xmath18 is exactly solvable for its ground state at @xmath9 .",
    "it will guide us in constructing the general family of spin models on 1d lattice with pbc .",
    "it will be rigorously proved that the dimer configurations , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , form an exact , two - fold degenerate ground subspace for the whole family .",
    "various features of this family of 1d models will be discussed in some detail .",
    "then , the generalization to two and three spatial dimensions will be discussed .",
    "our scheme allows us to construct higher dimensional models with exact knowledge of the ground state .",
    "the exponential degeneracy in the ground subspace of such models will be discussed .",
    "finally , we will conclude with some general discussion and remarks .",
    "on a chain with pbc , and for @xmath9 , the mg hamiltonian can be re - written as : @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath23 , is that of a block of three spins , the @xmath24 spin and its next two neighbours , coupled to each other identically .",
    "let us refer to these blocks as @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for a block of completely connected spins , and the subscript , 3 , refers to the number of spins in the block .",
    "spins within a block are understood to be identically coupled , unless specified .",
    "the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , for @xmath4 .",
    "this is easy to see if we re - write @xmath27 as @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the minimum energy spin configuration for @xmath25 has one free spin and the rest two spins forming a singlet .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath30\\otimes\\left|\\uparrow_{i+2}\\right > $ ] is one such eigen - configuration .",
    "there are two linearly independent ways of forming such configurations for which the total @xmath25 spin is 1/2 .",
    "since the mg chain is made up of @xmath25 units , the ground configuration of mg chain can be constructed in such a way that it is also the lowest energy eigen - configuration of @xmath25 .",
    "this is not possible in general .",
    "interestingly , this is possible for mg chain because the minimum energy configuration of @xmath25 has strictly one bond - singlet and a _ free _ spin .",
    "free \" spin is free in the sense that it can bond with the  outside \" world , and the new composite configuration is still the eigen configuration of the block - hamiltonian with energy , @xmath31 , provided other two spins of the block form a singlet . since every spin on the mg chain has identical exchange connectivity , the above considerations imply that the ground state configuration of @xmath18 is the one where every three neighbouring spins share exactly one bond - singlet . the key observation to make",
    "is the fact that _ the fundamental block has odd number of spins _ , and _ its minimum energy configuration contains exactly one free spin while rest forming a singlet_. all this straight forwardly leads to the exact solution of the ground state of mg chain , already mentioned in the introduction , and can be proved rigorously using the inequality , @xmath32 and the identities , @xmath33=0\\ ; \\forall\\ ; k \\neq l\\ ; \\mbox{and}\\ ; m$ ] ; @xmath34 @xmath35 = -s(s+1)[l , m]$ ] . if @xmath36 is such an eigen state of the hamiltonian that the upper bound of the inequality equals the lower bound , then @xmath36 is also the ground state of the hamiltonian . in other words",
    ", this inequality ensures that _ an eigen state of the hamiltonian which is also the ground state of the basic building blocks , is the ground state of the hamiltonian_. in the next section , we will construct a general family of one - dimensional spin hamiltonians , and show that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the exact ground state configurations for the whole family .",
    "* the model :* let us consider a block , @xmath37 , of identically and completely connected @xmath38 spins where @xmath39 is a positive integer .",
    "the identical and complete connectedness of spins means that every spin in a block is coupled to every other , with same strength ( which is taken to be unity ) as shown in fig.([b3_b5 ] ) for @xmath40 and 2 .    on a spin chain ,",
    "any site @xmath41 and its next @xmath42 neighbours will form a @xmath37 unit once they are identically and completely coupled .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath24 such block on a 1d lattice is written as : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 . adding all such block hamiltonians",
    "gives the total hamiltonian for the spin chain made up of @xmath37 units .",
    "there are exactly @xmath42 number of first neighbour ( nearest neighbour ) pairs , @xmath47 number of second neighbour pairs and so on , within each @xmath37 unit .",
    "therefore , the total hamiltonian for a @xmath37 spin chain with pbc is : @xmath48 & = & j\\sum_{i=1}^l \\left[\\;2\\nu\\s_i\\cdot\\s_{i+1 } + ( 2\\nu-1)\\s_i\\cdot\\s_{i+2 }                               + \\cdots + 2\\s_i\\cdot\\s_{i+2\\nu-1 } + \\s_i\\cdot\\s_{i+2\\nu}\\;\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\                           & = & j\\sum_{i=1}^l\\sum_{j=1}^{2\\nu}(2\\nu+1-j)\\s_i\\cdot\\s_{i+j } \\label{hnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , on a @xmath37 spin chain , @xmath24 spin is coupled to next @xmath42 neighbours with linearly decreasing exchange coupling .",
    "note that the hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath49 is just the mg hamiltonian with dimer ground state .",
    "we will show that @xmath50 $ ] , for any @xmath39 , has the same ground state .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 can be regarded as the label for the members in our family of 1d spin models with two - fold degenerate dimer ground state .    *",
    "the ground state :* in order to find the ground state energy and the corresponding eigen - configurations of @xmath50 $ ] , consider the minimum energy configurations for a @xmath37 unit .",
    "re - writing @xmath51 as @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 $ ] tells us that the total spin , @xmath55 , being minimum corresponds to the lowest energy of the block . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the minimum energy is @xmath56 , and the corresponding spin configurations are such that there is exactly one free spin while rest @xmath42 spins forming a _ block - singlet_. a block - singlet can be described in terms of the bond - singlets ( valence bond or dimers , as we often call them so ) .",
    "since there are many , independent ways of doing that , a block - singlet has an intrinsic degeneracy of valence bond configurations .",
    "for example , @xmath57 s minimum energy configuration consists of a free spin , and a block - singlet of four spins . for @xmath4",
    ", there are exactly two linearly independent valence bond configurations for a block - singlet of four spins .",
    "we will see later that in certain other models , this intrinsic degeneracy leads to a ground state with exponential degeneracy , and hence finite entropy density in the ground state . in the following ,",
    "we try to construct the exact ground state configurations of @xmath50 $ ] , for all values of @xmath39 .",
    "if we can find _ a configuration where every block of successive @xmath38 spins share exactly one block - singlet of @xmath42 spins , then it is the ground state configuration of _",
    "@xmath50 $ ] .",

    "one is simply @xmath67\\otimes[i+2,i+3]\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes[i+2\\nu-2,i+2\\nu-1 ] $ ] .",

    "each of these dimer representations for 2@xmath39-spin block - singlet contains exactly @xmath39 dimers .",
    "the fact that every site has identical exchange connectivity , suppresses the choices allowed by the intrinsic degeneracy of block - singlets .",
    "the only configurations which satisfy the condition that every block of neighbouring @xmath38 spins on a chain has exactly @xmath39 dimers , are @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "the proof by induction is based on the understanding of such relationships , and hence illustrates the superstability of the dimer configurations as the ground state of our family of hamiltonians , in a rigorous way .    * the proof by induction * : for @xmath49 , the hamiltonian operator is @xmath79 = h_{mg}$ ]",

    "this was illustrated by a variational calculation of the dispersion of the defect ( the dangling spin as shown in fig.([kink ] ) ) boundary between two exact ground state configurations@xcite .",
    "later , it was exactly proved that there is an energy gap in the excitation above the exact dimer ground states of the mg model@xcite . a method to calculate the lower bound for the energy gap",
    "was also developed , and applied to certain quantum antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "we have calculated the dispersion relation for the propagating defect , variationally , for @xmath57 and @xmath97 chains .",

    "actually , we have considered the chains with odd number of spins , @xmath110 , in order to find the defect s dispersion relation , and taken the limit @xmath111 .",

    "the dangling spin can have either @xmath116 polarization or @xmath117 polarization .",
    "these defect configurations are non - orthogonal .",
    "since @xmath118 do not form a complete set of states , the propagating defect state , @xmath112 , is only a variational choice .",
    "nevertheless , it gives us some idea of the nature of excitations above the ground state . from the dispersion relations for the defect",

    "one can also consider the case where there are many such dangling spins in the dimer background , and consider the possibility of the bound states .",
    "we will not do it here .    * the connection with the coulomb problem in 1d",
    ":* it is important to observe that the exchange coupling of the models constructed in the present work , @xmath119 , is exactly like the coulomb interaction in one dimension , albeit with a range @xmath120 @xcite . from @xmath121 neighbour",
    "onwards , the exchange coupling is zero .",
    "but there is no restriction on the range , @xmath120 , and it can be anything .",
    "hence , what we have found , essentially , is a quantum spin analogue of the coulomb problem in one dimension which was studied exactly by lenard and baxter long ago@xcite .",
    "it is an interesting and unexpected connection .",
    "analogous to the coulomb problem , one would expect plasmon like gapped excitations in a spin model with infinitely long ranged , linear exchange coupling . for antiferromagnetic exchange coupling , as we saw just now , the energy gap increases with @xmath120 .",
    "but the analogy has interesting consequences for the spin models with ferromagnetic linear exchange coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian for the ferromagnetic case is written as : @xmath122 .",
    "here , @xmath6 , and @xmath120 can be even as well as odd unlike the antiferromagnetic case discussed in the present work .",
    "the ground state energy for a general spin s is , @xmath123 . and",
    "the exact one magnon dispersion with respect to the ground state energy is : @xmath124/[1-\\mbox{cos}(k)]\\right\\ } $ ] , @xmath125 where is @xmath126 is an integer .",
    "the wavenumber , @xmath127 , takes values between @xmath128 and @xmath129 . for any finite @xmath120 , @xmath130 quadratically , as @xmath131",
    "hence , the excitations are gapless . in order to consider the analogue of coulomb problem , @xmath120 should of the order of @xmath7 , and let @xmath7 go to infinity .",
    "we put @xmath132 , and rescale @xmath16 to @xmath133 ( as the ground state as well as the magnon excitation energy goes as @xmath134 for large r ) .",
    "then , @xmath135}{l^2[1-cos(k ) ] } \\right\\ } $ ] .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic limit , the magnon excitation has a gap of value @xmath136 , and a totally flat dispersion .",
    "hence , a ferromagnet with infinite ranged linear exchange coupling is gapped .",
    "next , we discuss another type of 1d spin models where the dimer ground state is exponentially degenerate .",
    "these models are also constructed of @xmath37 units .",
    "* 1d models with exponentially degenerate dimer ground state :* as mentioned earlier , the block - singlets made up of four or more spins always have degenerate dimer representations .",
    "this intrinsic degeneracy at the block level , however , could not be greatly exploited in our previous construction which led to the class of linear exchange spin models on a chain .",
    "the dimer ground state of this class of models is only two - fold degenerate .",
    "now , we construct another type of spin models , on a closed chain , whose ground state has exponentially large number of degenerate dimer configurations . here , the degeneracy of ground state is exponential in the number of lattice sites , @xmath7 . to illustrate this class of models , we describe a particular construction using @xmath57 units .",
    "consider a closed chain with even number of sites .",

    "the ground state energy of this spin model is @xmath156 , and the ground state configurations can be written as : @xmath157\\otimes[5,6,7,8]\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes[l-3,l-2,l-1,l ] \\label{b5_gnd1}\\ ] ] since each of these four spin block - singlet , @xmath158 $ ] , has two dimer representations , @xmath159 represents @xmath160 degenerate , dimer configurations forming the ground subspace . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the ground state energy is still given by the above expression , but the degeneracy of the ground state is 2(2@xmath161 ) .",
    "this is so because , for @xmath9 , any four spins of a @xmath57 block can form singlet in the minimum energy configuration .",
    "this allows following configurations , together with @xmath162 , in the ground state .",
    "@xmath163\\otimes[6,7,8,9]\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes[l-2,l-1,l,1 ] \\label{b5_gnd2}\\ ] ] and hence , the degeneracy is doubled .",
    "the procedure , described here in detail , can be directly applied to construct models using bigger spin blocks .",
    "thus we are able to construct quantum spin chains with exponentially degenerate dimer ground state , and interesting thing to note is that the ground state is exactly known for @xmath164 , unlike the linear exchange models where @xmath8 is strictly one .",
    "or , in other words , the dimer configurations are superstable for all values of @xmath8 greater than or equal to one .",
    "we will come across the same features once more in the following section , while considering the higher dimensional generalization of our scheme .    in this section ,",
    "we have developed the concepts , and explicitly used them in constructing one dimensional spin models . in the next section",
    ", we will use this understanding to construct models with exact dimer ground state in two and three dimensions . before going to the next section",
    ", we must mention that recently there have been some generalizations of mg and ss models @xcite . in this regard",
    ", we would like to stress upon the point that our scheme provides a very general framework to construct all such models using only two things : ( 1 ) the basic building blocks , and ( 2 ) arranging them in such a way that each block is able to satisfy its minimum energy configuration even when being a part of the full assembly .",
    "this we have already seen working in one dimension .",
    "we will illustrate this in the following section by constructing various models in two and three dimensions .",
    "the ss model is a two dimensional spin model with a specific exchange connectivity@xcite .",
    "it has an exact dimer ground state with no degeneracy .",
    "it is , in some sense , the two dimensional analogue of the mg model . the ss model , like the mg model , is made up of fundamental blocks of three spins , that is , @xmath25 units in our language .",
    "hence , ss model is the first member of the family of 2d spin models with an exact dimer ground state , if labeled according to our scheme .",
    "this correspondence motivates us to construct spin models in higher dimensions whose ground states can be known exactly .",
    "in fact , we can construct a whole lot of them .",
    "the rules are very simple .",
    "_ pick one spin of a @xmath37 unit as free . leave rest to form a block - singlet of size @xmath42 .",
    "each of the @xmath42 spins of the singlet forming block can act as the  free \" spin for the neighbouring blocks . and any given block - singlet can be fully or partially shared by other  free \" spins_. this allows us to extend the network in higher dimensions .",
    "the hamiltonian for any such model is just the sum of all the block - hamiltonians . _",
    "only those dimer configurations which satisfy each building block s minimum energy configuration form the exact ground state configurations .",
    "_ this set of rules seem sufficiently general for constructing models with exact dimer ground states .",
    "for example , one gets the ss model by applying these rules to make 2d model using @xmath25 units .",
    "we consider a generalized @xmath37 unit , where one of the spins is picked up to be exclusive such that it is coupled to the rest by unit exchange strength while the rest are completely coupled among themselves by some exchange @xmath8 .",
    "these basic spin blocks are still completely connected , but the couplings are not identical .",
    "this choice is exactly like the one we had for constructing 1d models with exponentially degenerate dimer ground state .",
    "see fig.([b3_b5 ] ) , where @xmath25 and @xmath57 units are shown in one , two and three spatial dimensions .",
    "block - singlet + free spin \" is the lowest energy configuration of the @xmath37 unit for @xmath165 .",
    "we can construct models in 2d ( and also in 3d ) in such a way that _ spatially disjoint block - singlets _ form the exact ground state configurations for @xmath165 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the domain of superstability for the dimer ground states in these models is @xmath166 , unlike the case of translationally invariant 1d models constructed in the previous section .",
    "there , the dimer configurations form a superstable ground state only at @xmath9 .",
    "also , the spatial disjointness preserves the intrinsic degeneracy of the block - singlets which makes the ground state exponentially degenerate .",
    "thus , we are able to construct _ spin models with finite entropy density in the ground state_. to illustrate all this , we describe models made up of @xmath57 units .    following the rules stated above , a ladder model , as shown in fig.([ladder ] ) ,",
    "is constructed with @xmath57 units ( we could have constructed a simpler ladder with @xmath25 units , but the exponentially degenerate ground state can not be realized there .",
    "the dimers along the rungs form the exact ground state configuration of a @xmath25 ladder . ) .",
    "these ladders properly arranged on a plane , give rise to a certain 2d spin model as shown in fig.([2d_model ] ) . assuming a ribbon like geometry for the ladder and the toroidal geometry for the 2d model",
    ", we can easily find their ground state energies . in our construction",
    ", each lattice point of the ladder model contributes exactly one @xmath57 unit , whereas each site on the 2d model contributes two such units .",
    "therefore , the ground state energies , for @xmath166 , of the ladder and the 2d model are @xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the total number of sites .",
    "the ground state energy per site , in units of the strongest exchange ( @xmath169 for ladder , and @xmath170 for 2d model ) , is just @xmath171 .",
    "the blocks of spins , connected with thick lines as shown in the figs .",
    "( [ ladder ] ) and ( [ 2d_model ] ) , forming singlets is the exact ground state configuration . for the ladder , the ground state configuration is shown in fig.([ladder_ground_state ] ) .",
    "the ground state for the 2d model is similar to that of the ladder .",
    "the two - fold intrinsic degeneracy of each block - singlet makes the ground subspace @xmath160-fold degenerate .",
    "the entropy density in the ground state is @xmath172 , just one fourth of that of a paramagnet .",
    "each block - singlet has two independent bond - singlet configurations , therefore , the ground subspace consists of @xmath160 distinct dimer or valence bond configurations .",
    "for example , two of these configurations are the columnar dimer states which are the exact ground states of a certain model constructed by bose and mitra@xcite .",
    "thus , the ground state of models discussed here is a spin - liquid as well as a dimer - liquid , as the dimers within a block - singlet are correlated , but there is no correlation between dimers belonging to different block - singlets .",
    "one can easily construct certain other models , using same rules , whose ground states are dimer solids , though we will not discuss these models explicitly .",
    "the generalizations of ss model , considered in @xcite , provide good examples of the higher dimensional models made up of @xmath25 units .",
    "so , we will consider the next block , that is , @xmath57 .",
    "the three dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath57 block is shown in fig.([b3_b5 ] ) .",
    "there can be many ways of constructing 3d models using @xmath57-pyramids .",
    "we consider a case where two such pyramids share the basal plane to form an octahedra .",
    "for @xmath165 , the four spins of the common basal plane form a block - singlet . layers of the corner - sharing octahedra , stacked in certain ways , form one such model .",
    "the projection of one such layer on x - y plane is shown in fig.([3d_model ] ) .",
    "the ground state configurations are such that the singlet blocks are lying in orthogonal planes .",
    "it is topologically similar to the orthogonal arrangement of dimers in the exact ground state of 2d ss model except that these are block - singlets , and are lying in orthogonal planes .",
    "the spatial disjointness of the block - singlets belonging to different planes gives rise to exponentially degenerate dimer ground state .",
    "the possibilities for making such models are enormous , and therefore can not be exhausted in one place .",
    "but one thing must be emphasized upon .",
    "the basis for constructing models with exact dimer ground states , as discussed in the present work , is very general .",
    "the model hamiltonians that may be constructed with these rules , may be of definite importance in understanding some physics of the spin systems .",
    "we , first , summarize the main results .",
    "we have constructed a family of one - dimensional spin models with linearly decreasing exchange coupling .",
    "the range of coupling is the family parameter which is decided by the size of the basic building block . the fundamental building blocks are completely connected blocks of odd number of identical spins . all the members in the family",
    "have an exact , two - fold degenerate dimer ground state .",
    "there exists an energy gap in the excitation spectrum above the dimer ground states , and it seems to be increasing monotonically for the higher members in the family .",
    "the interesting analogy of this family of models , with the coulomb problem in one dimension is discussed .",
    "one dimensional spin models with exponentially degenerate dimer ground states are also discussed .",
    "this way of constructing models is easily generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "we are able to construct models in two and three dimensions , with exact dimer ground states .",
    "the ground state of many such models is exponentially degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy in the ground state of these models arises due to many degenerate dimer representations of the block - singlets forming the ground state configuration .",
    "these models , thus , provide explicit examples of the systems with finite entropy density in the ground state , and hence violating the third law of thermodynamics . also , these are the models with _ finite ranged _ rvb type ground states , spanned by an exponentially large subset of the full set of linearly independent valence - bond configurations .",
    "the range of the valence - bonds is decided by the size of the building block .",
    "the rules for constructing such models are explicitly discussed .",
    "we hope that the general class of models proposed here may be useful in studying the quantum phase transitions in the frustrated spin systems .",
    "the exact knowledge of the ground state with exponential degeneracy , in these models , is particularly remarkable .",
    "the building block way of looking at these models is quite in the spirit of synthetic chemists . it may be possible to realize such models",
