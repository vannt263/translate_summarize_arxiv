    "we are concerned with the existence , uniqueness , and asymptotic behavior of steady transonic flows past a curved wedge , involving transonic shocks , governed by the two - dimensional full euler equations .",
    "when a supersonic flow past a straight - sided wedge whose half - angle is less than the detachment angle , a shock is expected to form , which is attached to the wedge vertex . if the upstream steady flow is a uniform supersonic state , we can find the corresponding constant flow downstream along the straight - sided wedge boundary , together with a straight shock separating the two states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - perturbedshock ] ) , by using the shock polar determined by the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions and the entropy condition ( _ cf .",
    "[ fig - shockpolaruv ] ) .",
    "however , the downstream state is not uniquely solvable . in general , there are two solutions",
    ", one of which corresponds to a weaker shock than the other .",
    "as normally expected , a physically admissible shock should be stable under small perturbations .",
    "therefore , it is important to analyze the stability of these shocks in order to understand underlying physics .",
    "the wedge problem described above has a long history at least dating back to the 1930s .",
    "prandtl @xcite in 1936 first conjectured that the weaker shock solution is stable , and hence physically admissible .",
    "there has been a long debate about whether the stronger shock is stable for decades ; see courant - friedrichs @xcite , section 123 , and von neumann @xcite .",
    "see also liu @xcite and serre @xcite .",
    "when the downstream flow is supersonic , the corresponding shock is called a supersonic shock , which is a weaker shock .",
    "this case has been analyzed for the potential flow equation in @xcite with certain convexity assumption on the wedge and in @xcite for an almost straight - sided wedge .",
    "the existence and stability of the steady supersonic shocks for the full euler equations under the bv perturbation of both the upstream flow and the slope of the wedge boundary have been established in chen - zhang - zhu @xcite and chen - li @xcite for lipschitz wedges .    for transonic shocks ( _ i.e. _ , the downstream flow is subsonic ) , there are two cases : the transonic shock with the subsonic state corresponding to arc @xmath0 ( which is a weaker shock ) and the one corresponding to arc @xmath1 ( which is a stronger shock ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - shockpolaruv ] ) .",
    "the strong shock case has been studied in chen - fang @xcite for the potential flow .",
    "plane , height=257 ]    it is well known that the jump of the entropy function across the shock is of cubic order of the shock strength . in general ,",
    "the strength of transonic shocks is large , so the full euler system is a more accurate model than the potential flow or isentropic euler equations . in fang",
    "@xcite , the euler equations are studied with a uniform bernoulli constant for both strong and weak transonic shocks . because the framework is the weighted sobolev space ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the shock slope or subsonic solution was not derived . on the other hand",
    ", the asymptotic behavior can be seen more conveniently within the framework of hlder spaces . in yin - zhou @xcite ,",
    "the hlder norms were used for the estimates of the full euler equations with the assumption on the sharpness of the wedge angle , which means that the subsonic state is near point @xmath2 in the shock polar . in chen - chen - feldman @xcite , the weaker transonic shock , which corresponds to the whole arc @xmath0 ,",
    "was investigated ; and the existence , uniqueness , stability , and asymptotic behavior of subsonic solutions were obtained . in @xcite , a potential function is used to reduce the four euler equations into one elliptic equation in the subsonic region .",
    "the method was first proposed in @xcite and has the advantage of integrating the conservation properties of the euler system into a single elliptic equation . however , working on the potential function further requires its lipschitz estimate , besides the @xmath3estimate , to keep the subsonicity of the flow .",
    "there are other related papers about transonic shocks , such as @xcite for transonic flows past three - dimensional wedges and @xcite about transonic flows past a perturbed cone ; see also @xcite for the approaches developed earlier for dealing with transonic shock flows .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze both strong and weak transonic shocks and establish the existence , uniqueness , and asymptotic behavior of the subsonic solutions under the perturbation of both the upstream supersonic flows and the wedge boundaries . through rigorous mathematical analysis",
    ", we are able to prove the stability of both weak and strong transonic shocks .",
    "the strategy is to use the physical variables to make the estimates , instead of the potential function .",
    "the advantage of this method is that only the lower regularity ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath3estimate ) is sufficient to guarantee the subsonicity .",
    "furthermore , estimating the physical state function @xmath4 directly ( see equations ) also yields a better asymptotic decay rate : for weaker transonic shocks , the decay rate is only @xmath5 in our earlier paper @xcite ; while , in this paper , we will show that the subsonic solution decays to a limit state at rate , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 depending only on the background states ( see remark [ rem:2.2a ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we first use the lagrangian coordinates to straighten the streamlines .",
    "the reason for this is that the bernoulli variable and entropy are conserved along the streamlines , and using the streamline as one of the coordinates simplifies the formulation , especially for the asymptotic behavior of the solution .",
    "then , as in @xcite , we decompose the euler system into two algebraic equations and two elliptic equations .",
    "differentiating the two elliptic equations gives rise to a second - order elliptic equation in divergence form for the flow direction @xmath8 .",
    "given @xmath9 in an expected function space for solutions , we can solve for a new variable @xmath10 as the solution of the linear equation for iterations whose coefficients are evaluated on the given function @xmath9 . once we solve for @xmath10 and obtain the desired estimates , the rest variables are then updated .",
    "thus , we construct a map @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the perturbations from the background subsonic state .",
    "the estimates based on our method do not yield the contraction for @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the banach fixed point argument does not work ; instead , we employ the schauder fixed point argument to obtain the existence of the subsonic solution . for the uniqueness , we estimate the difference of two solutions by using the weighted hlder norms with a lower decay rate .",
    "one point we want to emphasize here is that the decay pattern is different from that for potential flow . in a potential flow ,",
    "the decay is with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "for example , if @xmath16 converges to @xmath17 at rate @xmath5 , then @xmath18 converges at rate @xmath6 . for the euler equations , because the bernoulli variable and the entropy function are constant along streamlines , the physical variables @xmath19 do not converge to the background state along the streamlines .",
    "they converge only across the streamlines away from the wedge .",
    "therefore , when the elliptic estimates are performed , the scaling is with respect to the distance from the wedge , rather than @xmath15 .",
    "this results in the following decay pattern : in lagrangian coordinates @xmath20 , there exists an asymptotic limit @xmath21 ; @xmath9 converges to @xmath22 at rate @xmath23 , but @xmath24 converges at rate @xmath25 .",
    "that is , the extra decay for the derivatives is only along the @xmath26direction .",
    "finally , we remark that our analysis of transonic shocks for the euler equations for potential and non - potential flow , started in chen - feldman @xcite to formulate the transonic shock problems as one - phase free boundary problems , is motivated by the previous works on variational one - phase free boundary problems for nonlinear elliptic equations in alt - caffarelli @xcite , alt - caffarelli - friedman @xcite , and the references cited therein .",
    "one of the main difficulties in dealing with the transonic shock problems is that the corresponding elliptic one - phase free boundary problems are non - variational in general , so that the complete solution to the free boundary problems requires different approaches and new techniques which are further developed in this paper in the physical realm of the full euler equations for compressible fluids .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following sections . in ",
    "[ sec - setup ] , the wedge problem is formulated as a free boundary problem and the main theorem is stated . in  [ sec - lagrange ] , the problem is reformulated in lagrangian coordinates . in  [ sec - decompose ] ,",
