    "supernovae are thought to be one of the main sources of the hot coronal gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "there have been few absorption - line observations of the hot gas in individual supernova remnants ( snrs ) , however , so global descriptions of the ism have been forced to rely on models of evolving snrs to reproduce the characteristics observed in absorption line studies of the galactic disk and halo @xcite . in particular , the @xmath7 1032 , 1038 lines are very important probes of collisionally ionized gas near 3@xmath810@xmath9k . while several snrs have been observed in @xcite , few have been studied in absorption . @xcite",
    "detected absorption in the vela supernova remnant with the _ copernicus _ satellite , but since then the opportunities to observe the spectral region containing the lines have been limited . with the launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _",

    "hd 5980 ( sk78 , av 229 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) is a luminous blue variable / wolf - rayet star on the edge of the region ngc346 ( n66 ) in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "de boer & savage ( 1980 ) first noticed an absorption system at v@xmath12 kms@xmath1  arising in a highly ionized cloud in _ international ultraviolet explorer _ spectra of this star .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cloud might be an snr moving toward hd  5980 at @xmath5150 kms@xmath1 .",
    "this interpretation was confirmed by a radio detection of an snr in n66 , snr00577226 @xcite coinciding with the x - ray source ikt18 @xcite .",
    "high velocity h@xmath13  emission was also seen at this position by @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed hd 5980 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. they detected the snr in ultraviolet absorption lines , and were able to separate the absorption into two components at v@xmath14 and @xmath15 kms@xmath1  ( v@xmath12 and @xmath16 kms@xmath1 ) in some of the lines .",
    "they also detected excess absorption at v@xmath17 and + 64 kms@xmath1  ( v@xmath18 and @xmath19 kms@xmath1 ) , suggesting that the high velocity gas is located on the far side of an expanding structure .",
    "the stis spectrum contains absorption features of and , which probe gas at @xmath52@xmath2010@xmath9 k and @xmath51@xmath2010@xmath9 k , respectively . in this paper",
    "we present @xmath3  data on even hotter gas in snr00577226 .",

    "an o7  iaf+ star @xcite which lies close to hd  5980 on the sky , and which we use as a comparison star ( dataset p10302 ) , was observed on the same day as hd  5980 and reduced in the same manner .",
    "the @xmath3  instrument consists of four channels , two optimized for short ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths ( sic1 and sic2 : 9051100 ) and two optimized for longer uv wavelengths ( lif1 and lif2 : 10001187 ) .",

    "we require that any absorption feature be present in two channels to be considered real .",
    "the raw data were reduced using the standard @xmath3  calibration pipeline ( calfuse v1.8.7 ) available at the johns hopkins university .",
    "the velocity zero - point was set by shifting the milky way component of the h@xmath2 and low ionization lines to 0kms@xmath1 , based on the results of @xcite .",
    "the spectra were binned by three pixels ( @xmath56kms@xmath1  near ) , and the nominal resolution of the data is @xmath520kms@xmath1  ( fwhm ) .",

    "the two stars are separated by @xmath24 , or @xmath517 pc , assuming a distance of 59 kpc to the smc @xcite .",
    "absorption features of @xmath01032 and @xmath0977 are detected at + 300 kms@xmath1  in the @xmath3  spectrum of hd  5980 , but no similar features are seen in the sk80 spectrum .",
    "the edge of the radio snr extends very close to the projected position of sk80 @xcite .",
    "either the + 300kms@xmath1  absorbing region does not extend as far as sk80 , or sk80 is in front of the absorbing gas .",
    "absorption from hot gas in the milky way and the smc is also seen in the spectra of both stars , and will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "the @xmath01038 line at @xmath25  kms@xmath1  is contaminated by two h@xmath2 lines , p(1)5 - 0 and r(2)5 - 0 , but it is clearly much stronger in the hd  5980 spectrum than in sk80 .",

    "the + 300kms@xmath1  absorption toward hd  5980 remains , and is well described by a gaussian with a fwhm of 75kms@xmath1 .",

    "we do not detect the v@xmath27  kms@xmath1component in or .",
    "the absorption lines from this component seen by @xcite were very weak , so this component may be blended with the main absorption system at + 300kms@xmath1  in the @xmath3data .",
    "@xcite detected a weak component at + 325kms@xmath1 , which if present in the @xmath3  data would be blended with the broad + 300kms@xmath1component .",

    "no or h@xmath2 absorption is seen at + 300kms@xmath1 .",
    "the and lines in the @xmath3  bandpass are blended with other absorption lines , so we can not determine whether any high velocity absorption is present .",
    "column densities were calculated by integrating the apparent column density per unit velocity over the velocity range given , an approach which is valid if the intrinsic line width is comparable to or broader than the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) @xcite . at temperatures of 3@xmath2010@xmath9k , where the abundance of peaks in collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite , the line width from thermal broadening ( @xmath29kms@xmath1 ) is larger than the @xmath3  lsf width ( @xmath30kms@xmath1 ) , so the condition is most likely satisfied .",
    "the abundance peaks at a lower temperature ( @xmath31  k ) , and it is possible that unresolved saturated absorption exists . in this case the measured column density of is a lower limit to the true value .",
    "the uncertainty estimates in table 1 include statistical noise fluctuations and modest continuum placement uncertainty @xcite .",
    "for the very faint line , continuum placement may dominate the uncertainty , so its effects were evaluated by varying the continuum fit .",
    "we have reanalyzed the stis data taken with the e140 m grating from @xcite so that the equivalent widths could be measured over the same velocity ranges used for the @xmath3  data .",
    "these values are also given in table 1 ( lines with @xmath32  were measured from stis data ) .",
    "we also measured the equivalent width and column density toward hd  5890 using the spectrum that had been divided by the sk80 spectrum .",
    "using the divided spectrum , we place an upper limit ( 3@xmath33 ) of log @xmath6()@xmath34 on the approaching side , @xmath35% of the column density of the receding side .",
    "models of evolving snr @xcite predict the production of in gas heated to @xmath36  k by shocks .",
    "the existence of in the snr requires shock speeds of at least @xmath37  kms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if the absorption seen in the @xmath3  spectrum traces only the receding side of the shell , and the systemic velocity of the snr is + 176 kms@xmath1  @xcite , then the expansion velocity is at least 124kms@xmath1 , and may be higher if the sight line is offset from the center of the remnant .",
    "@xcite detected h@xmath13  emission separated from the smc emission by + 170kms@xmath1 , so shock velocities this high certainly seem plausible . assuming that @xmath6()/@xmath6(o ) @xmath38 0.2 @xcite , and using log  [ o / h ]  @xmath39 for ngc346 @xcite , we find that @xmath6(h@xmath40 ) @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "the 3-@xmath33 upper limit on from the stis spectrum is @xmath6()@xmath43 @xmath42 , which corresponds to @xmath6()@xmath44 @xmath42 , so h@xmath40/h@xmath45 @xmath46 38 .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath6(h )  @xmath47 @xmath42 in the shell , close to our estimated value of @xmath6(h@xmath40 ) , so most of the gas in the shell may be ionized if the h@xmath45 and h@xmath40 are cospatial .",

    "the red sides of the profiles of the high ions have similar shapes , while on the blue side the higher ions extend over progressively larger velocity ranges , so that in terms of v@xmath48 , the velocity of the blue edge of the profile , v@xmath48 ( ) @xmath23 v@xmath48 ( ) @xmath23 v@xmath48 ( ) . the has a distinct tail of absorption to negative relative velocities that extends almost as far as the absorption . near @xmath25 kms@xmath1",

    "there appears to be gas at several different temperatures at this velocity , a conclusion supported by the presence of , , and .",
    "the and absorption at @xmath51  kms@xmath1 , along with the absence of absorption by lower ionization lines , suggests that this material is dominated by hot gas .",
    "a possible interpretation of this ionization structure is a multi - phase shell of swept - up ism moving at the highest velocity ( @xmath25 kms@xmath1 ) , with the cavity behind it filled with hot gas .",
    "the / ratio is @xmath55 in the shell , similar to that seen in the old snr radio loop iv , and on the high side of the ism average of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the line ratios imply temperatures lower than that indicated by the line width , suggesting that non - thermal motions contribute to the line broadening .",
    "table 2 lists the observed @xmath6()/@xmath6 ( ) and @xmath6()/@xmath6 ( ) ratios for snr00577226 , for the smc and milky way along this sight line , and the general disk and halo values .",
    "also listed are the predictions of models of different mechanisms for producing high ions .",
    "the observed @xmath6()/@xmath6 ( ) ratio in snr00577226 agrees well with the predicted ranges of models of evolving snrs .",
    "the observed value of @xmath6()/@xmath6 ( ) for snr00577226 is close to the milky way disk value , and very different from the halo value .",
    "the @xmath6()/@xmath6 ( ) ratio in the snr also agrees with the disk value . while there may be a metallicity effect on the observed ratios , the observed values for snr  0057  ",
    "7226 lend support to models of hot gas production @xcite in which supernovae are largely responsible for the highly ionized gas in the galactic disk , while different processes such as turbulent mixing layers @xcite and radiatively cooling fountain gas @xcite are responsible for the hot gas in the upper halo .",
    "the observed snr ratios are also quite different from the general smc ratios along this sight line , suggesting that mechanisms other than evolving snr , such as those listed in table 2 , contribute to the extended hot gas in the smc .",
    "the column density of in the snr is @xmath54065% of the column in the smc component ( excluding the snr ) .",
    "thus , only three such supernova remnants would be needed to explain all of the in the smc in this direction .",
    "since this sight line is in the star - forming region ngc346 , it is quite plausible that multiple snrs may exist along this sight line . the column density of in the snr is greater than that in the entire galactic component in this direction . if snr00577226 is representative of supernova remnants in general , then they may be able to account for much of the observed in the ism of the milky way .",
