    "the detection of a new particle having a sub - gev mass would likely hint at the presence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this possibility has been raised recently by the observation of three events for the rare decay mode @xmath0 with dimuon invariant masses narrowly clustered around 214.3mev by the hypercp collaboration a few years ago  @xcite .",
    "although these events can be accounted for within the standard model ( sm ) when long - distance contributions are properly included  @xcite , the probability that the three events have the same dimuon mass in the sm is less than 1  percent .",
    "this makes it reasonable to speculate that a light neutral particle , @xmath4 , is responsible for the observed dimuon - mass distribution via the decay chain @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the new - particle interpretation of the hypercp result has been theoretically explored to some extent in the literature  @xcite .",
    "various ideas that have been proposed include the possibility that @xmath4 is spinless or that it has spin one . in the spinless case , @xmath4 could be a sgoldstino in supersymmetric models  @xcite or a @xmath6-odd higgs boson in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite . in the case of @xmath4 being a spin-1 particle ,",
    "one possible candidate is the gauge ( @xmath7 ) boson of an extra u(1 ) gauge group in some extensions of the  sm  @xcite .",
    "the presence of @xmath4 in @xmath0 implies that it also contributes to other @xmath8 transitions , such as the kaon decays @xmath9 .",
    "in general , the contributions of @xmath4 to @xmath8 processes fall into two types .",
    "the first one is induced by the flavor - changing ( effective ) couplings of @xmath4 to @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to these two - quark contributions , there are so - called four - quark contributions of @xmath4 , which arise from the combined effects of the usual four - quark @xmath8 operators in the sm and the flavor - conserving couplings of @xmath4 to quarks , as well as its interactions with the sm gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "although the two - quark contributions are generally expected to dominate over the four - quark ones , in some models the parameter space may have regions where the two types of contributions are comparable in size and hence could interfere destructively  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , to explore the @xmath4 hypothesis in detail and compare its predictions with experimental results in a definite way , it is necessary to work under some model - dependent assumptions .",
    "there are a number experiments that have recently been performed or are still ongoing to test the @xmath4 hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "their results have begun to restrict some of the proposed ideas on @xmath4 in the literature . in particular , as already mentioned , @xmath4 could be a light @xmath6-odd higgs boson in the nmssm . in the specific nmssm scenario considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 does not couple to up - type quarks and has the same flavor - conserving coupling @xmath11 to all down - type quarks , implying that the four - quark contributions of @xmath4 to @xmath8 decays are proportional to  @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "recent searches for the radiative decays @xmath12 by the cleo and babar collaborations  @xcite have come back negative and imposed sufficiently small upper - bounds on @xmath11 to make the four - quark contributions negligible compared to the two - quark ones . with only the two - quark contributions being present ,",
    "the scalar part of the @xmath13 coupling is already constrained by @xmath14 data to be negligibly small , whereas its pseudoscalar part can be probed by @xmath15 measurements  @xcite .",
    "there are now preliminary results on the branching ratio @xmath16 of @xmath17 reported by the ktev and e391a collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the ktev preliminary measurement @xmath18 at 90%  c.l .",
    "@xcite is the much more stringent of the two and has an upper bound almost 20 times smaller than the lower limit @xmath19 predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite under the assumption that the @xmath13 pseudoscalar coupling , @xmath20 , is purely real .",
    "however , there is a possibility that @xmath20 has an imaginary part , and in the case where this coupling is mostly imaginary the predicted lower bound , @xmath21 , can be much smaller .",
    "more precisely , one can find that @xmath22 , which evades the above bound from ktev , if @xmath23 and , moreover , @xmath24 if @xmath20 is purely imaginary , @xmath25 being the usual @xmath6-violation parameter in kaon mixing .",
    "if the ktev preliminary result stands in their final report , then it will have imposed a significant constraint on  @xmath20 , restricting it to be almost purely imaginary , for the scenario in which @xmath4 has spin zero and its four - quark contributions to flavor - changing transitions are negligible . to place stronger restrictions on  @xmath20 ,",
    "it is important to look for the decays of particles other than neutral kaons , such as @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath4 couplings in the @xmath8 sector are in general independent of those in the @xmath28 sector , there is also new information from the latter sector that seems compatible with the results of the @xmath29 measurements .",
    "very recently the belle collaboration has given a  preliminary report on their search for a  spinless @xmath4 in @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 values restricted within a small region around @xmath33mev .",
    "they did not observe any event and provided stringent upper - bounds on the branching ratios of @xmath34 and @xmath35  @xcite .    unlike the spinless case ,",
    "the scenario in which @xmath4 has spin one is not yet as strongly challenged by experimental data , for it predicts that the lower limit of the branching ratio of @xmath17 arising from the two - quark @xmath36 axial - vector coupling , taken to be real , is @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "this prediction is well below the preliminary upper - bound of @xmath38 from ktev  @xcite and could get lower in the presence of an imaginary part of the @xmath36 coupling .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore the spin-1 case further , which we will do here .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the contributions of @xmath4 with spin  1 to a number of rare processes involving mesons containing the @xmath1 quark",
    ". we will not deal with specific models , but will instead adopt a model - independent approach , assuming that @xmath4 has flavor - changing two - quark couplings to down - type quarks only and that its four - quark contributions to flavor - changing transitions are negligible compared to the two - quark ones .",
    "accordingly , since the @xmath39 and @xmath40 couplings generally are not related to the @xmath13 couplings , we further assume that the @xmath41 couplings each have both parity - even and parity - odd parts , but we leave the parity of @xmath4 unspecified .",
    "specifically , we allow @xmath4 to have both vector and axial - vector couplings to @xmath42 .",
    "the more limited case of @xmath4 being an axial - vector boson with only parity - even couplings to @xmath42 has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . following earlier work  @xcite , to be consistent with hypercp observations we also assume that @xmath4 does not interact strongly and decays inside the detector with @xmath43 . in exploring the effect of @xmath4 with spin  1 on @xmath2 transitions",
    ", we will incorporate the latest experimental information and obtain constraints on the flavor - changing couplings of @xmath4 in order to predict upper bounds on the rates of a number of rare decays . at this point",
    "it is worth pointing out that , since we let @xmath4 have vector couplings to @xmath42 , the transitions in which we are interested include @xmath2 decays into @xmath4 and a pseudoscalar meson , such as pion or kaon , which were not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . as our numbers will show",
    ", most of the branching ratios of the decays we consider can be large enough to be detected in near - future @xmath2 experiments .",
    "this can serve to guide experimental searches for @xmath4 in order to help confirm or rule out the spin-1 case .",
    "assuming that @xmath4 has spin one and does not carry electric or color charge , we can express the lagrangian describing its effective couplings to a @xmath1  quark and a light quark @xmath44 or @xmath45 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 parametrize the vector and axial - vector couplings , respectively , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "generally , the constants @xmath51 can be complex . in the following ,",
    "we derive the contributions of these two - quark interactions of @xmath4 to the amplitudes for several processes involving @xmath1-flavored mesons .",
    "as mentioned above , we follow here the scenario in which the four - quark flavor - changing contributions of @xmath4 are negligible compared to the effects induced by  @xmath52 .    the first transition we will consider is @xmath53-@xmath54 mixing , which is characterized by the physical mass - difference @xmath55 between the heavy and light mass - eigenstates in the @xmath53-@xmath54 system .",
    "this observable is related to the matrix element @xmath56 for the mixing by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is obtained from the effective hamiltonian @xmath59 for the sm plus @xmath4-mediated contributions using @xmath60  @xcite .",

    "<S> in light of recent experimental information from the cleo , babar , ktev , and belle collaborations , we investigate some consequences of the possibility that a light spin - one particle is responsible for the three @xmath0 events observed by the hypercp experiment . in particular , allowing the new particle to have both vector and axial - vector couplings to ordinary fermions , we systematically study its contributions to various processes involving @xmath1-flavored mesons , including @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing as well as leptonic , inclusive , and exclusive @xmath2 decays . using the latest experimental data , we extract bounds on its couplings and </S>",
    "<S> subsequently estimate upper limits for the branching ratios of a number of @xmath2 decays with the new particle . </S>",
    "<S> this can serve to guide experimental searches for the particle in order to help confirm or refute its existence . </S>"
