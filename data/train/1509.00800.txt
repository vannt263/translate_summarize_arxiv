    "understanding physical properties of the high-@xmath11 galaxies beyond @xmath13 is very important , because such galaxies are not only building blocks of lower-@xmath11 galaxies and local galaxies but also the leading candidate of ionizing sources for the cosmic reionization .",

    "these observational results imply that ly@xmath6 attenuation by the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is significant because the neutral fraction of the hydrogen is high at such higher-@xmath11 before the completion of the cosmic reionization",

    "we note that the lowest dark halo and stellar masses are around @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .    in order to calibrate parameters in the code such as the sn feedback efficiency",

    ", we argue that the shape of the smf depends on the definition of the stellar mass , i.e. , with or without the remnant mass as the stellar mass .",
    "the effect is important for low-@xmath11 galaxies , but , it is negligible at the high-@xmath11 discussed in this paper .      after the identification of the simulated galaxies ,",

    "the sed of each star particle , which has its own age , metallicity , and mass , is calculated by using the population synthesis code pgase2 @xcite .",
    "then , we sum up the seds of the star particles composing a simulated galaxy to obtain the total intrinsic sed of the galaxy . we also adopt the nebular continuum and the hydrogen recombination lines ( ly@xmath6 , h@xmath6 , h@xmath7 , and h@xmath59 ) calculated by pgase2 with the case b approximation . moreover , the metal lines emitting from h ii regions are calculated based on @xcite and @xcite , in which expected line fluxes are calculated by the photo - ionization code cloudy @xcite .",
    "these line luminosity ( @xmath60 ) are proportional to h@xmath7 luminosity ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the lyman continuum escape fraction and @xmath64 is the metallicity dependent emission efficiency for each line which is calculated in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    "hence , uncertainty in the line flux estimation due to the choice of sps models is also a factor of 2 .    after calculating the intrinsic seds of simulated galaxies , then",
    ", we consider the dust attenuation for the continuum and the lines of them .",
    "the procedure of dust attenuation for the continuum is same as our previous work @xcite .",
    "we adopt the calzetti law @xcite for the shape of the attenuation law . for the attenuation amplitude",
    ", we calculate the escape probability of uv photons at @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",

[ eq : ep ] corresponds to the well - mixed dusty slab geometry . on the other hand , it is the case with a central infinitely thin dusty sheet when @xmath73 is zero .",

    "these values are directly obtained from our simulations as follows .",
    "the dust mass @xmath85 and @xmath86 are assumed to be proportional to the metal mass , @xmath87 , and the half stellar mass radius , @xmath88 , of each simulated galaxy , respectively .",

    "next , we consider the dust attenuation for various emission lines . in this study",

    "according to @xcite , the attenuation for emission lines is a factor of about 2 larger than that for the continuum at the same wavelength , although different factors were suggested by recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the line escape probability ( @xmath101 ) at @xmath70 which is the normalization of the attenuation law for emission lines is @xmath102 where @xmath71 and 2.27 are the normalization of the attenuation law for the continuum ( eq . [ eq : ep ] ) and the attenuation enhancement for emission lines , respectively .",
    "after calculation of the dust attenuation for the continuum and lines , we finally calculate the dust thermal emission in the same manner as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one difference from our previous work @xcite is that not only the continuum photon energy but also the line photon energy absorbed by dust is converted into the dust luminosity .",
    "we assume that all the energy absorbed by the dust is re - emitted in the ir emission .",

    "we assume that 50 % of the total metal mass in a simulated galaxy is converted into the dust mass ( @xmath85 ) .",

    "we note that , in this study , the pdr / molecular cloud lines are not considered and the pah features are not included in our seds , either .",
    "these are put into our future work .      here , we explore whether our simulation is reasonable to predict line detectability .",
    "we check essential physical properties of our simulated galaxies such as the stellar mass , the sfr , the dust attenuation and the metallicity which are necessary to calculate the line fluxes . in order to directly compare our model with the observations , we make galaxies distribution on a light - cone from @xmath16 to @xmath113 the same as in our previous work @xcite . the field - of - view ( fov ) in this study is ( @xmath114 ) which is about 150 times wider than the hst fov .",
