    "qcd with finite density is an important topic of both , experimental and theoretical studies . in particular",
    "one would like to understand the various transitions to different states of matter that are conjectured for the qcd phase diagram . exploring these phase transitions",
    "is clearly a non - perturbative problem and non - perturbative methods must be applied for such studies . in principle",
    "the lattice qcd formulation provides a suitable non - perturbative framework , and as long as the chemical potential is zero this approach may be used to obtain reliable quantitative results .",
    "however , if one works at finite density a severe technical problem emerges : the fermion determinant is complex at non - zero chemical potential @xmath0 and can not be used as a probability weight in a monte carlo calculation .",
    "various reweighting and expansion techniques have been explored in recent years and the reviews at the annual lattice conference provide a glimpse at the corresponding developments @xcite .",
    "an interesting option is to work not in the grand canonical approach with a chemical potential @xmath0 , but instead to use canonical partition sums with fixed net quark number @xmath1 .",
    "several studies of this alternative perspective can be found in the literature @xcite  @xcite . so far the focus was mainly either on reweighting techniques or full canonical simulations at a fixed quark number .    here",
    "we explore the perspectives of a fugacity expansion of the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the expansion coefficients are fermion determinants projected to a fixed net quark number , so - called _ canonical determinants_. the expansion is a laurent series in the fugacity parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the inverse temperature ) which has properties different from the more conventional taylor expansion in @xmath4 . however , the possible application to lattice qcd at finite density is the same for both expansions : one computes the expansion coefficients in simulations at @xmath5 and uses the series to explore qcd at @xmath6 .    in this article",
    "we discuss the evaluation and the properties of canonical determinants .",
    "they are computed as fourier moments of the fermion determinant at imaginary chemical potential @xmath7 , which we evaluate efficiently using a recently proposed dimensional reduction formula @xcite .",
    "we study the distribution properties of the canonical determinants and analyze the convergence of the fugacity expansion for various temperatures in the confined and deconfined phases .",
    "this analysis is done for a fixed numerical effort , i.e. , a fixed number of 256 sampling points of @xmath8 in the interval @xmath9 $ ] used for the evaluation of the fourier transformation to obtain the canonical determinants .",
    "the starting point for our study of canonical determinants and the fugacity expansion is wilson s lattice dirac operator @xmath10 with chemical potential @xmath0 on lattices of size @xmath11 .",
    "the lattice spacing will be denoted by @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 . for two mass - degenerate flavors the corresponding grand canonical partition function",
    "is given by @xmath14 \\",

    "one may explore the generalized @xmath24-hermiticity relation for wilson fermions , @xmath25 , to establish the relation @xmath26 between canonical determinants with positive and negative quark numbers @xmath1 .",
    "for vanishing quark number @xmath27 the canonical determinant is real , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    ".parameters of our numerical simulation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also attempt a comparison of our results for the quark number susceptibility @xmath29 at @xmath5 to the results from the taylor expansion .",
    "the corresponding numbers are listed in table  [ chitable ] ( again interpolated to our values of @xmath30 ) .",
    "we find that up to temperatures near the crossover the agreement of the two approaches is reasonable .",
    "given the fact that the calculation @xcite and our exploratory study differ considerable in statistics and volume , this agreement is satisfactory . above the crossover",
    "we see , however , a rather strong discrepancy .",
    "we suspect two main reasons for this discrepancy : 1 ) the rather small volumes that are available for our calculation , and 2 ) the fact that for the larger values of @xmath30 higher fourier modes contribute significantly ( the factor @xmath31 in the second moment @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ moments ] ) enhances them further ) which in the current setting of 256 sampling points for the numerical evaluation of the fourier integral are not sufficiently accurate .",
    "in this exploratory study we analyzed the canonical determinants of 2-flavor lattice qcd with wilson fermions .",
    "the canonical determinants are the coefficients in the fugacity expansion of the fermion determinant and may be calculated as the fourier modes with respect to imaginary chemical potential .",
    "we speed up this evaluation by using a dimensional reduction formula for the grand canonical determinant .",
    "we illustrate that a sizable dependence of the fermion determinant on the imaginary chemical potential sets in only at temperatures near the crossover temperature , which already shows that at the crossover an enhancement of the higher quark numbers can be expected . studying the size distribution of the canonical determinants",
    "we find that their distribution is roughly gaussian in the net quark number @xmath1 with a width that starts to increase at the crossover .",
    "the average phases of the canonical determinants drop quickly with @xmath1 , but the drop is slowed above the crossover temperature .",
    "this analysis sheds light on the complex phase problem from the point of view of the fugacity series .",
    "we continue with a systematical analysis of the convergence properties of the fugacity expansion by comparing the truncated fugacity series to an exact evaluation of the grand canonical determinant at several values of the chemical potential .",
    "it is shown that for lower temperatures we can obtain very good accuracy up to @xmath33 , while above the crossover we only reach @xmath34 .",
    "we stress that these results are specific for the numerical effort we invest here , in particular 256 sampling points for the evaluation of the fourier moments . on a finite lattice",
    "the fugacity expansion is a finite laurent series , and in principle it is possible to compute all coefficients such that the series representation of the grand canonical determinant becomes exact .",
    "finally we use the fugacity series to explore the evaluation of the quark number density and the quark number susceptibility through first and second moments of the truncated fugacity series .",
    "this is an interesting alternative to a standard calculation where the quark number @xmath1 is a binomial in the quark fields , @xmath35 which after integrating out the fermions is related to the trace of the quark propagator , @xmath36 tr @xmath37 . in this form",
    "@xmath1 is difficult to evaluate numerically using , e.g. , stochastic estimators .",
    "once the canonical determinants @xmath21 are available the expressions in terms of the moments of the fugacity expansion are considerably simpler and we demonstrate that the approach is compatible with the conventional method up to temperatures where we have sufficiently control over the fugacity series .",
    "conceptually the fugacity expansion falls in the same category as the taylor expansion : a series is used to extrapolate the information from a monte carlo simulation at @xmath5 to finite values of the chemical potential .",
    "thus both , taylor- and fugacity expansion face the same overlap problem , i.e. , the @xmath5 configurations used for evaluating the expansion coefficients may have rather little overlap with the configurations that dominate physics at finite @xmath0 .",
    "this limits both expansion approaches to small values of @xmath0 .",
    "concerning other properties , taylor- and fugacity expansion are different : at finite volume the fugacity series is a finite laurent series in the fugacity parameter @xmath2 , while the taylor series is an infinite series even at finite volume .",
    "thus the two series will have different properties and one should explore which of the two approaches provides a better expansion around @xmath5 . to study this question",
    "we currently compare the two series in an effective theory for qcd , where a flux representation free of the complex phase problem allows one to obtain high precision reference data from a monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "these will be used to study the quality of the approximation from taylor- and fugacity series .",
    "we conclude with stressing that this exploratory work should be considered only as a first step towards a full development of fugacity expansion as a reliable tool in finite density lattice qcd .",
    "certainly further improvement of the numerical techniques and more tests will be necessary to assess the full potential of the approach .",
