    "a basic yet widely applicable problem in computer science and economics is to allocate discrete objects to agents given the preferences of the agents over the objects .",
    "the setting is referred to as the _ assignment problem _ or the _ house allocation problem _  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in this setting , there is a set of agents @xmath0 , a set of objects @xmath1 with each agent @xmath2 expressing ordinal preferences @xmath3 over @xmath4 .",
    "the goal is to allocate the objects among the agents in a fair or optimal manner without allowing transfer of money .",
    "the assignment problem is a fundamental setting within the wider domain of _ fair division _ or _ multiagent resource allocation _  @xcite .",
    "the model is applicable to many resource allocation or fair division settings where the objects may be public houses , school seats , course enrollments , kidneys for transplant , car park spaces , chores , joint assets of a divorcing couple , or time slots in schedules .",
    "fair division has become a major area in ai research in the last decade , and especially the last few years  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we consider the fair assignment of indivisible objects .",
    "two of the most fundamental concepts of fairness are _ envy - freeness _ and _ proportionality_. envy - freeness requires that no agent considers that another agent s allocation would give him more utility than his own .",
    "proportionality requires that each agent should get an allocation that gives him at least @xmath5 of the utility that he would get if he was allocated all the objects . when agents ordinal preferences are known but utility functions are not given , then ordinal notions of envy - freeness and proportionality need to be formulated .",
    "we consider a number of ordinal fairness concepts .",
    "most of these concepts are based on the _ stochastic dominance ( sd ) _ relation which is a standard way of comparing fractional / randomized allocations .",
    "an agent prefers one allocation over another with respect to the sd relation if he gets at least as much utility from the former allocation as the latter for all cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences .",
    "although this paper is restricted to discrete assignments , using stochastic dominance to define fairness concepts for discrete assignments turns out to be fruitful .",
    "the fairness concepts we study include _ sd envy - freeness , weak sd envy - freeness , possible envy - freeness , sd proportionality , _ and _ weak sd proportionality .",
    "_ we consider the problems of computing a discrete assignment that satisfies some ordinal notion of fairness if one exists , and the problems of verifying whether a given assignment satisfies the fairness notions .",
    "[ [ contributions ] ] contributions + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we present a systematic way of formulating fairness properties in the context of the assignment problem . the logical relationships between the properties are proved .",
    "interestingly , our framework leads to new solution concepts such as weak sd proportionality that have not been studied before .",
    "the motivation to study a range of fairness properties is that , depending on the situation , only some of them are achievable . in addition , only some of them can be computed efficiently . in order to find fairest achievable assignment",
    ", one can start by checking whether there exists a fair assignment for the strongest notion of fairness .",
    "if not , one can try the next fairness concept that is weaker than the one already checked .",
    "we present a comprehensive study of the computational complexity of computing fair assignments under ordinal preferences . in particular",
    ", we present a polynomial - time algorithm to check whether an sd proportional exists even when agents may express indifferences .",
    "the algorithm generalizes the main result of @xcite ( theorem 1 ) who focused on strict preferences . for the case of two agents ,",
    "we obtain a polynomial - time algorithm to check whether an sd envy - free assignment exist .",
    "the result generalizes proposition 2 in @xcite in which preferences over objects were assumed to be strict . for a constant number of agents ,",
    "we propose a polynomial - time algorithm to check whether a weak sd proportional assignment exists . as a corollary , for two agents ,",
    "we obtain a polynomial - time algorithm to check whether a weak sd envy - free or a possible envy - free assignment exists . even for an unbounded number of agents , if the preferences are strict , we characterize the conditions under which a weak sd proportional assignment exists . we show that the problems of checking whether possible envy - free , sd envy - free , or weak sd envy - free assignments exist are np - complete . the result for possible envy - freeness answers an open problem posed in @xcite .",
    "our computational results are summarized in table  [ table : summary - fair ] .",
    "we show that our two main algorithms can be extended to the case where agents have different entitlements over the objects or if we additionally require the assignment to be pareto optimal .",
    "our study highlights the impacts of the following settings : @xmath6 randomized / fractional versus discrete assignments , @xmath7 strict versus non - strict preferences , and @xmath8 multiple objects per agent versus a single object per agent .",
    "since the fairness concepts we introduce may not be guaranteed to exist , we suggest possible ways to extend the fairness concepts .",
    "firstly , we consider the problem of maximizing the number of agents for whom the corresponding fairness constraint is satisfied .",
    "a criticism of this approach is that there can still be agents who are completely dissatisfied .",
    "we then consider an alternative approach in which the proportionality constraints is weakened in a natural and gradual manner .",
    "we refer to the concepts as _ optimal proportionality _ and _ optimal weak proportionality_. the fairness concepts are not only attractive but we show that an optimal proportional assignment can be computed in polynomial time and an optimal weak proportional assignment can be computed in polynomial time for a constant number of agents .",
    "proportionality and envy - freeness are two of the most established fairness concepts .",
    "proportionality dates back to at least the work of @xcite in the context of cake - cutting .",
    "it is also referred to as _",
    "fair share guarantee _ in the literature  @xcite .",
    "a formal study of envy - freeness in microeconomics can be traced back to the work of @xcite .",
    "the computation of fair discrete assignments has been intensely studied in the last decade within computer science . in many of the papers considered ,",
    "agents express cardinal utilities for the objects and the goal is to compute fair assignments  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a prominent paper is that of @xcite in which algorithms for approximately envy - free assignments are discussed .",
    "it follows from @xcite that even when two agents express cardinal utilities , checking whether there exists a proportional or envy - free assignment is np - complete .",
    "a closely related problem is the _ santa claus problem _ in which the agents again express cardinal utilities for objects and the goal is to compute an assignment which maximizes the utility of the agent that gets the least utility  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "just as in @xcite , we consider the setting in which agents only express ordinal preferences over objects .",
    "there are some merits of considering this setting .",
    "firstly , ordinal preferences require elicitation of less information from the agents .",
    "secondly , some of the weaker ordinal fairness concepts we consider may lead to positive existence or computational results .",
    "thirdly , some of the stronger ordinal fairness concepts we consider are more robust than the standard fairness concepts .",
    "fourthly , when the exchange of money is not possible , mechanisms that elicit cardinal preferences may be more susceptible to manipulation because of the larger strategy space .",
    "finally , it may be the case that cardinal preferences are simply not available .",
    "there are other papers in fair division in which agents explicitly express ordinal preferences over sets of objects rather than simply expressing preferences over objects . for these more expressive models ,",
    "the computational complexity of computing fair assignments is either even higher  @xcite or representing preferences require exponential space  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we restrict agents to simply express ordinal preferences over objects .",
    "some papers assume ordinal preferences but superimpose a cardinal utilities via some scoring function  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , this approach does not allow for indifferences in a canonical way and has led to negative complexity results  @xcite .",
    "@xcite assumed that agents have lexicographic preferences and tried to maximize the lexicographic signature of the worst off agents .",
    "however the problem is np - hard if there are more than two equivalence classes .",
    "the ordinal fairness concepts we consider are sd envy - freeness ; weak sd envy - freeness ; possible envy - freeness ; sd proportionality ; and weak sd proportionality",
    ". not all of these concepts are new but they have not been examined systematically for discrete assignments . sd envy - freeness and weak sd envy - freeness have been considered in the randomized assignment domain  @xcite but not the discrete domain .",
    "@xcite referred to sd envy - freeness and weak sd envy - freeness as envy - freeness and weak envy - freeness .",
    "sd envy - freeness and weak sd envy - freeness have been considered implicitly for discrete assignments but the treatment was axiomatic  @xcite .",
    "mathematically equivalent versions of sd envy - freeness and weak sd envy - freeness have been considered by @xcite but only for strict preferences .",
    "they referred to them as necessary ( completion ) envy - freeness and possible ( completion ) envy - freeness .",
    "a concept equivalent to sd proportionality was examined by @xcite but again only for strict preferences .",
    "@xcite referred to weak sd proportionality simply as ordinal fairness .",
    "interestingly , weak sd or possible proportionality has not been studied in randomized or discrete settings ( to the best of our knowledge ) .",
    "envy - freeness is well - established in fair division , especially cake - cutting .",
    "fair division of goods has been extensively studied within economics but in most of the papers , either the goods are divisible or agents are allowed to use money to compensate each other  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a _ uniform assignment _ is a fractional assignment in which each agent gets @xmath5-th of each object .",

    "we show that an optimal proportional discrete assignment can be computed in polynomial time whereas an optimal weak proportional discrete assignment can be computed in polynomial time if the number of agents is bounded .",
    "both fairness notions appear to promising solution concepts for fair division of indivisible objects .",
    "they are also compatible with pareto optimality .",
    "the optimal notions can be be further refined with respect to leximin refinements .",
    "there are number of directions for future research .",
    "the complexity of finding a weak sd proportional discrete assignment remains open for an unbounded number of agents with non - strict preferences .",
    "the complexity of checking whether an sd envy - free assignment exists for a bounded number of agents is open .",
    "it will be interesting to see how various approximation algorithms in the literature designed to reduce envy or maximize welfare fare in terms of satisfying ordinal notions of fairness ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "examining other dominance notions may also be fruitful  @xcite .",
    "another avenue for positive algorithmic results is to consider parameterized algorithms .",
    "finally , strategic aspects of ordinal fairness is another interesting direction for future research .",
