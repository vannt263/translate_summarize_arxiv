    "the second law of thermodynamics states that isolated systems always tend to an equilibrium state of maximum entropy , where equilibrium means that the macroscopic properties of the system are the same in any part of it .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics can also be deduced from an analysis of the efficiency of a thermal engine , and according to clausius : `` no process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a body of lower temperature to a body of higher temperature ''  @xcite in modern statistical physics the second law may be inferred from boltzmann h - theorem  @xcite and it is generally accepted as a natural consequence of the energy exchange among molecules in the kinetic theory of gases : when molecules collide in a gas there is a transfer of kinetic energy from the more energetic to the less energetic molecules and , as a consequence , after a transient , all molecules share , in average , the same energy .",
    "this result is the theorem of equipartition of energy that characterizes the maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium distribution of velocities , and it is associated with the maximum entropy state .",
    "however , in particular situations , it may happen that the entropy decreases as a function of time ; examples are self - organized systems and biological organisms",
    ". one common characteristic of those systems is that they are not in equilibrium even if they seem stable or stationary in time  @xcite .",
    "the idea that economic systems also possess some kind of equilibrium state is an underlying concept in classical economic theory , going from pareto optimality to nash equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the edgeworth box model is an example of how a simple exchange conservative model can lead two consumers to optimize their respective utility  @xcite .",
    "but in other cases there are symptomatic evidences that economic systems can be out of equilibrium and/or exhibit metastable equilibrium states .",
    "this is the case when studying the wealth and income distribution .",
    "fluctuations around an equilibrium state behave in a gaussian or normal way : the probability of rare events is very small , as the gaussian distribution exhibits exponential tails . on the other hand ,",
    "empirical studies focusing the income distribution of workers , companies and countries were first presented more than a century ago by vilfredo pareto and he discovered that the income distribution does not behave in a gaussian way but exhibits `` heavy tails '' , i.e. the cumulative probability @xmath0 of workers whose income is at least @xmath1 follows a power law  @xcite given by @xmath2 .",
    "nowadays , this power law distribution is known as pareto distribution , and the corresponding exponent @xmath3 is named pareto exponent .",
    "however , recent data indicates that , even though pareto distribution provides a good fit in the high income range , it does not agree with the observed data over the middle and low income range .",
    "for instance , data from japan  @xcite , italy  @xcite , india  @xcite , the united states of america and the united kingdom  @xcite are fitted by a log - normal or boltzmann distribution with the maximum located at the middle - income region plus a power law for the high - income strata .",
    "the existence of these two regimes may be justified in a qualitative way by stating that in the low and middle income classes the process of wealth accumulation is additive ( and mainly due to wages ) , causing a gaussian - like distribution , while in the high income range , wealth grows in a multiplicative way , generating the observed power law tail  @xcite .    in recent years",
    "physicists and economists working in complexity science proposed different mathematical models of wealth exchange among economic agents in order to try to explain these empirical data ( for a review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . quoting ref .",
    "@xcite : _ inspired by boltzmann s kinetic theory of collisions in gases , econophysicists introduced an alternative two - body approach , where agents perform pairwise economic transactions and transfer money from one agent to another .",
    "actually , this approach was pioneered by the sociologist john angle  @xcite_. most of these models consider an ensemble of interacting economic agents , each one possessing a given amount of endowments , money@xcite or assets@xcite that represents its economics resources and that we will describe as `` wealth '' .",
    "most of these models focus on one particular aspect of economic processes : the competition among different agents ( countries , enterprises , etc . )",
    "acting in an environment where all exchanges of wealth between agents take place in a conservative manner , i.e. , a conservative exchange market model ( cemm)@xcite .",
    "this restriction has several motivations : on the one hand , it can be argued that resources are material objects , and consequently they can not be created or destroyed by means of exchanging them . on the other hand",
    ", the use of the cemm implies that the exchange model is a zero - sum game , something that may seem at odds with usual economic orthodoxy .",
    "however , the results also hold for systems in which the total amount of wealth increases uniformly and smoothly in time .",
    "the interaction among agents consists in a exchange of a fixed  @xcite or random  @xcite amount of their wealth .",
    "the process of exchange is similar to the collision of molecules in a gas and the amount of exchanged wealth when two agents interact corresponds to some economic `` energy '' that may be transferred for one agent to another .",
    "if this exchanged amount corresponds to a fixed or random fraction of one of the interacting agents wealth , the resulting wealth distribution is  unsurprisingly  a gibbs exponential distribution  @xcite .",
    "aiming at obtaining distributions with power law tails , in order to describe the higher income region of the wealth distribution histogram , several methods have been proposed mostly introducing a multiplicative risk aversion that acts as a multiplicative noise .",
    "numerical results@xcite , as well as some analytical calculations  @xcite , indicate that a frequent outcome in these models is _ condensation _ ,",
    "i.e. concentration of all available wealth in just one or a few agents .",
    "this final state corresponds to a kind of equipartition of poverty : all agents ( except for a set of zero measure ) possess zero wealth while one , or a few ones , concentrate all available resources . in any case",
    "the final configuration is a stationary state of `` equilibrium '' , since agents with zero wealth can not participate in further exchanges .",
    "several methods have been proposed to avoid this situation , for instance , exchange rules where the poorer agents are favored  @xcite or taxes and regulations  @xcite . here , instead",
    ", we are mainly interested in the condensed state and in the dynamics driving the system to this condensed state , as well as in the entropy behavior when the system approaches condensation .",
    "as previously stated , exchange rules are determinant of the long - time behavior of the system .",
    "while we can obtain an exponential boltzmann - gibbs distribution - and consequently a maximum entropy state - if the exchanged fraction is fixed or determined at random , condensation is the outcome when exchange rules are so that , when two agents interact , the exchanged amount @xmath4 is proportional to the wealth of one of the participants or to both  @xcite but in no case one participant can win more that the value he put in stake .",
    "so , the exchange process is a kind of lottery where no agent can win more than his own possessions .",
    "one particular and widely used exchange rule is to consider that the fraction of transferred wealth from agent @xmath5 to agent @xmath6 , or vice versa , is : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the respective wealth of the two interacting agents , and @xmath10 is a risk - aversion factor , so the capital fraction that the agents risk during the exchange is @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that even approaching a condensed state , in the intermediate stages the wealth distribution goes through a series of power law distributions where the pareto exponent increases as a function of time  @xcite .",
    "the problem with the previous definition of @xmath4 is that it involves a logical comparison that is difficult to be treated analytically .",
    "here we consider another form of @xmath4 .",
    "we define an analytical expression of @xmath4 that guarantees that no agent participating in the exchange risk more than the quantity he can win . to do",
    "that we define @xmath12 , that presents similar properties and is equal to the wealth of the poorer partner when the wealth of the richer agents is much bigger than the other .",
    "notice also that we eliminated the risk - aversion factor , just by considering @xmath13 , because we have verified that one does not need the multiplicative noise to obtain the condensed state . using this exchange rule and the methods of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics we show in this paper that the entropy decreases in the intermediate stages leading to a condensed state of minimum entropy ( and maximum inequality , gini coefficient equal to 1 ) .",
    "the text is organized as follows : in the next section we write the exchange model in the form of a master equation that is solved by numerical iteration in section 3 .",
    "next in section 4 we calculate the entropy of the system as well as the theil coefficient and we discuss why in this case the boltzmann h - theorem is not verified .",
    "finally the results are discussed and the conclusions presented in section 5 .",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath14 individuals , each one characterized by a given value of a continuous variable @xmath1 .",
    "this variable can represent the wealth , cash , properties , or some other measure of the agent s fortune , but it can also represent a physical scalar quantity , as energy . like in the kinetic theory of gases , agents may interact and exchange any fraction of @xmath1 . in the standard kinetic theory the exchange of random fractions of energy leads to an equilibrium state described by maxwell - boltzmann distribution@xcite . in the same way , considering @xmath1 as representing the money owned by an agent , and random exchanges between agents , a maxwellian money distribution is also found@xcite .",
    "however , as previously stated , different exchange mechanisms can be considered .",
    "several of them are in some way proportional to the wealth owned by the participating agents and leads to a condensed state@xcite . here",
    "we study a very simple non - linear exchange rule .",
    "let us consider two agents , with wealth @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we assume that when they interact they exchange @xmath15 .",
    "it implies that when the two agents have very similar wealth , the exchanged amount is approximately half of each agent wealth , while if the possessions are very different , the transferred amount is equal to the poorer agent s wealth .",
    "this expression yields a fair exchange rule in the sense that no agent risks more that the amount he can win .",
    "indeed the rule is very similar to the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath16 but here we avoid the logical operator using an analytical expression",
    ".    we also aim at investigating the effect of favoring the poorer agent in an interaction .",
    "condensation of wealth is an undesirable effect in models describing wealth distribution and many authors proposed different ingredients to avoid this effect .",
    "one of the most popular recipes is to define a wealth - dependent probability of winning a transaction .",
    "for example in refs .",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the winning probability is higher for the poorer participating agent . even if this recipe seems counterintuitive , favoring the poorer agent in every transaction",
    "somehow emulates a regulatory policy imposed by a government . to assess the effects of this kind of policy",
    ", we assume that in an interaction between two agents with wealth @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the probability @xmath17 that the agent with wealth @xmath8 wins the exchanged amount , @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 may assume any value in the interval @xmath21 $ ] .",

    ", we first construct the lorenz curves by defining @xmath108 as the fraction of the agent population with wealth lower or equal to @xmath109 , that is , @xmath110 and the fraction of wealth @xmath111 belonging to this population as @xmath112 as both @xmath108 and @xmath113 are uniquely defined by @xmath114 we may build a function @xmath115 , called the lorenz curve , as the fraction of wealth @xmath113 calculated at a value of @xmath114 that corresponds to the population fraction @xmath116 .",
    "[ fig : lorenzuni ] shows the time evolution of the lorenz curves corresponding to the runs with uniform initial conditions .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the lorenz curves present a negative curvature whose absolute value increases in time for @xmath66 and , as one should expect , the limit for @xmath83 is a condensed state , or an almost @xmath117-distribution for zero or a small value of @xmath20 , while the share of the wealth is rather stable and even improves for high values of @xmath20 .",
    ", at different times , width=415 ]    the gini coefficient is defined as  @xcite @xmath118 which gives a measure of how unequal the wealth distribution is : for a distribution where all agents have the same amount of wealth , @xmath119 , the lorenz curve is a straight line such that @xmath120 , yielding @xmath121 . on the other hand when all wealth belong to just one agent , @xmath122 .",
    "[ fig : gini ] shows the evolution of the gini coefficient for the iterations starting from a normal distribution and from a uniform distribution .",
    "the initial value of the gini coefficient is higher in the case of the uniform distribution but for @xmath123 time steps the system already `` forgot '' the initial conditions and the gini coefficient monotonically increases asymptotically approaching @xmath75 for @xmath124 .",
    "we have shown , both by analytical and numerical methods that exchange models where the exchange fraction can not be bigger than the capital of any of the participants , leads to a condensed state and so , to a state of minimum entropy , in disagreement with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , this state is a state of equilibrium and a state that represents a kind of thermal dead of markets , as no more exchanges are possible when all , or almost all agents ( with the exception of a set of zero measure ) , have wealth equal to zero .",
    "that means that this kind of exchange rule induces a behavior completely different of the one predicted by boltzmann h - theorem .",
    "the main difference comes from the _ quantity _ of wealth , ( or of the exchanged resource ) , that the agents can exchange . as we discussed previously ,",
    "if the exchange assets are determined completely at random , the boltzmann - gibbs distribution is recovered  @xcite . also , if an `` unfair '' rule of exchange is introduced , for instance allowing one agent to take all the assets of the other partner , a distribution with a higher gini coefficient is obtained and there is no condensed state  @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that condensation emerges from the fact that it is impossible to receive more money that the quantity already owned .",
    "what seems to be a fair exchange rule has the implication of spreading misery . to avoid condensation and the thermal death of markets",
    "some regulation , or some minimum allowance is necessary to favor the poorer agents .",
    "when there are no regulations and/or when no one can win more than he has , the dynamics leads to a condensed state and to a frozen economy .",
    "this result emphasize the importance of regulations and also of loans , as they permit to invest more capital than the one owned by each agent .",
    "also , politics of acting on the poorest agent , as described in an extremal dynamics model  @xcite , tend to avoid this condensed state .",
    "if one wants to compare this result with the second law of thermodynamics applied to physical systems , or to thermodynamic models for economic systems as the ones described , for example , by mimkes  @xcite then random or unfair exchanges are essential features to recover the second law .",
    "this effect may seem awkward but we can think of physical systems where the exchange rule is similar to the one proposed here and , indeed , there exist physical systems that behave in a similar way .",
    "maybe the best known example are the _ moderators _ used in nuclear reactors , where particular materials are used to _ thermalize _",
    "neutrons transforming a wide distribution of energy into a distribution with a pronounced peak in the region of energy of interest .",
    "one can argue that even if the entropy of the neutrons decreases , the total entropy of the system increases .",
    "that is a good clue to better understand the behavior of the exchange model for markets .",
    "if the studied exchange model leads to a decrease of entropy and then to an ordered state of minimum entropy , this is because a ) each agent is described by a single parameter , his wealth , and b ) because poor agents have no possibility of recovery .",
    "this last item is important when considering policies to improve the wealth distribution .",
    "concerning the first item we should be aware that a pure exchange models provides a limited description of markets and trade , as they do not consider neither regulatory policies , nor production of goods and commodities , nor salaries , nor banks , nor debts .",
    "the limitation of those models was extensively discussed by gallegati _ et .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of their simplicity , we think that exchange models capture an essential characteristic of economical activity , and , in particular , of markets , i.e. accumulation of wealth in a few hands , on the other hand they show that equilibrium is probably not an essential ingredient in the description of markets . however , in the same way that uniform temperature leads a physical system to thermal death , in economic systems the thermal death is a consequence of a extreme inequality in revenues and wealth , and we hope to have exhaustively demonstrated this point in this article .",
