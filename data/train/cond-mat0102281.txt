    "the experimental evidence for charge and spin inhomogeneities in superconducting cuprates has been accumulating in the last few years @xcite .",
    "it is believed that these inhomogeneities are probably the result of strong competing electron - electron and electron - lattice interactions .",
    "the strong interactions can be hinted from the fact that cuprates are related to mott insulators , not to metals . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the major problem has been the description of the doped mott insulator .",
    "it is this state that finally evolves into a superconducting state .",
    "the origin of the inhomogeneities can be diverse .",
    "disorder and the natural charge localization effects that occur close to an insulating mott state are natural possibilities . furthermore , there is an emerging point of view that inhomogeneities may be in the heart of the superconducting phase .",
    "the difficulty in describing the superconducting state may be related with the fact that an important part of the physics occurs in real space .",
    "this should be contrasted with a fermi liquid description that is dominated by the fermi surface in momentum space . if the inhomogeneities observed experimentally are essential for the description of the superconducting state then a dual description in terms of real and momentum space is certainly required .    the search for a general principle or a special ( maybe hidden ) symmetry that facilitates the understanding of these materials is always desirable .",
    "it turns out that the intrinsic complexities of these systems are enormous .",
    "in fact , the experimental evidence seems to be that all the degrees of freedom , charge , spin , lattice , participate in a fundamental way in their physics .",
    "unfortunately , we may have to sacrifice the simplicity of description that helped us to understand the basic physics of many systems in the past . besides the strong local interactions that induce large charge fluctuations , long - range interactions associated with the insulating state can suppress the same degrees of freedom .",
    "we believe that it is the interplay between these two forces that is fundamental for the understanding of the physics in these systems . in this paper",
    "we assume that the physics in cuprates can be divided at least into two length scales . on the one hand",
    "there is the short length ( high energy ) scale that is associated with the behavior of the electrons at atomic distances .",
    "this piece of physics is dominated by the strong local interactions that lead to the mott insulator and it is well described by models of strongly correlated electrons such as the hubbard or the t - j model .",
    "this is a `` highly '' quantum regime where quantum fluctuations at atomic scales determine the physical response .",
    "since the short length scale is usually smaller than the size of systems studied numerically , these studies can provide a good physical insight .",
    "various analytical approaches to these strongly coupled models exist in 2d @xcite and although they can also provide insight into the main physical aspects of the problem they are unreliable in dealing with quantum fluctuations . in order to acquire intuition one",
    "is forced to look at purely academic models that can be solved beyond mean - field .",
    "this is the case of the various studies of the ising @xmath3 model where quantum spin fluctuations are suppressed by a large anisotropy in spin space @xcite , the spin - fermion models where the spins are treated classically @xcite or models with large number of components @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the long wavelength physics of the problem is dominated by long - range interactions such as the coulomb , casimir @xcite or entropic interactions that are essentially classical in origin @xcite .",
    "analytical treatments of these interactions have always been difficult even in statistical mechanical problems in 1d .",
    "therefore , from the theoretical point of view there are technical complications at all length scales .",
    "any theoretical treatment that intends to start from the microscopic picture from the beginning will encounter tremendous difficulties .    in this paper",
    "we follow a semi - phenomenological approach . at the short length",
    "scales we have known for a long time that doped mott insulators have a big `` aversion '' to charge homogeneity @xcite .",
    "this happens because there is a large loss of magnetic energy when charge delocalizes .",
    "even before superconductivity was discovered in cuprate oxides the concept of _ strings _ and quantum confinement of holes was well understood : when a hole moves in an antiferromagnet it produces a string of overturned spins with an energy growing with its length @xcite . when the hopping energy , @xmath4 , is smaller than the antiferromagnetic exchange , @xmath5 , strings are the dominant processes in antiferromagnets ( although higher energy delocalizing processes called trugman loops are also possible @xcite ) .",
    "when two holes are injected into an antiferromagnet there is a gain in magnetic and kinetic energy if they move together instead of separately .",
    "strings are suppressed because the second hole heals the string generated by the first one .",
    "this picture of the diluted mott insulator is generic .",
    "it can be obtained analytically in the ising @xmath3 model and is also observed in numerical simulations of the su(2 ) models as well @xcite . because of the tendency to segregate charge , mott insulators are at the edge for phase separation into hole - rich and hole - poor regions @xcite .",
    "still to this date there is a heated debate about the border to phase separation in the phase diagram of the @xmath3 model @xcite .",
    "more recently the concept of _ stripes _ in the @xmath3 model has emerged due to density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations by white and scalapino ( ws ) @xcite . these simulations show clear signs of charge order . in the ws picture when holes are doped into the antiferromagnet they first form pairs that condense into lines of charge with magnetic anti - phase domain walls ( adw ) .",
    "this condensation process , as shown in analytical approaches to the ising @xmath3 models @xcite and in other numerical studies @xcite , has to do with the gain in kinetic energy of a _ single _ hole due to the formation of an adw ( moreover , trugman loops are supressed in this case @xcite ) .",
    "that is , for a finite linear density of holes ( vanishing 2d density ) the gain in kinetic energy by making a domain wall is enough to compensate for the loss of magnetic energy due to the formation of a magnetic defects",
    ". we should stress that we are not concerned with the problem of the phase diagram of the @xmath3 model because this phase diagram most certainly _ can not _ be the phase diagram of cuprate oxides .",
    "there are many important interactions in cuprates that are not included in the @xmath3 model .",
    "we will argue below that coupling to the lattice , for instance , is relevant for the experimental phase diagram .",
    "we assume that the tendency of the diluted mott insulator to form bound state pairs of holes is universal .",
    "long - range interactions and their eventual screening are probably the key to understand the phase diagram of cuprates @xcite . at low doping , because of the existence of a large charge gap in the mott insulator , charge dynamics is suppressed and as a consequence dynamical screening as well .",
    "all the physics rests in the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , when a small concentration of hole is introduced into the cuo@xmath6 layers long - range interactions should play a major role .",
    "these long - range interactions will be effective in suppressing the tendency to phase separation as stressed by emery and kivelson ( ek ) and collaborators @xcite and will lead to the generation of a finite length scale , @xmath7 , associated with domain size @xcite . in the absence of a lattice",
    "the long - range forces produce blobs or lakes of charge with characteristic size @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out , however , that in transition metal oxides the coupling to the lattice is strong and therefore the symmetry of rotations in real space is broken .",
    "charge modulation is therefore the final result of the tendency to phase separation and strong lattice coupling .",
    "the formation of this charge modulated phase is _ not _ the result of a fermi surface singularity as in the case of 1d charged density waves ( cdw ) .",
    "in fact , the ccs state described here has strong similarities with the metallic 2d charge density wave states observed in dichalcogenides @xcite that have very little resemblance with the 1d cdw states that are usually insulating @xcite . this state is probably better described as coming from the quantum melting of an anisotropic wigner crystal ( or bragg glass ) @xcite or an exotic cdw state @xcite . in classical statistical mechanics",
    "there are many analogues called liquid crystal phases : nematic , smectic , hexatic , etc @xcite .",
    "these are phases with long - range orientational order in the absence of translational order .",
    "another more mundane phase where translational symmetry is broken in 2d is an anisotropic _ membrane _ phase where translational order is broken along the principal vectors of the lattice @xcite .",
    "let us consider a static charge modulated phase induced along the @xmath8 direction in the 2d system with periodicity @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the charge density , @xmath11 , can be written as ( we use units such that @xmath12 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the background density , and @xmath15 is the complex order parameter that can be rewritten in terms of an amplitude @xmath16 and phase @xmath17 : @xmath18 the lines of constant phase at wave number @xmath19 are describe by @xmath20 where @xmath21 . in a inert background",
    "( such as a fermi liquid ) the local modulations of the density can lead to gaps at the fermi surface but the system as a whole remains homogeneous . in a mott insulator",
    "this is not necessarily so . in the regions of low charge density",
    "the mott insulator is essentially untouched . in these regions",
    "it is energetically advantageous for the system to form bound states of holes with d@xmath22 symmetry ( exactly like in a finite cluster or ladder ) with a gain magnetic energy @xcite . in the regions where charge density is large it is energetically more favorable for the system to have a gain of kinetic energy @xcite that liberates the holes to move as single particles and create adw .",
    "thus , the formation of a charge ordered state has to be accompanied by a change in the spin structure of the system with the creation of incommensurate spin fluctuations .",
    "the mechanism of gain of energy ( kinetic or magnetic ) depends strongly on the amount of charge density .",
    "moreover , deformations of amplitude of the order parameter of the ccs are always energetically costly .",
    "therefore , phase fluctuations are the low energy excitations in such systems . for a classical smectic phase , for instance , the free energy is given by @xmath23 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{{\\bf k } } \\omega_{{\\bf k } } |u_{s,{\\bf k}}|^2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is transverse stiffness of the smectic and @xmath25 is the splay elastic constant . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 indicate the gradient of the function in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the ordering direction , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath28 is the classical smectic dispersion relation . a membrane phase , on the other hand , would be described by @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) are the longitudinal ( transverse ) compressibilities .",
    "in fact , because the charge modulated state is composed of electrons we expect this modulated phase to be quantum in nature , that is , a _ quantum liquid crystal _ @xcite .",
    "notice that such a smooth charge distribution as proposed in ( [ rhor ] ) is different from the stripe phases discussed in the context of insulating cuprates and nickelates . in insulating nickelates static charge order",
    "is observed in neutron scattering and many other experiments @xcite .",
    "the key point is that higher _ harmonics _ of the fundamental bragg peaks associated with static order are observed in these systems .",
    "it implies sharp , well defined and isolated domain wall structures in real space . in superconducting systems where",
    "inelastic neutron scattering peaks are observed at equivalent positions there are _ no _ harmonics observed , even when the fundamental peaks are rather sharp . in la@xmath32nd@xmath33sr@xmath34cuo@xmath35 ( lnsco ) where tranquada and collaborators observed quasi - static peaks in neutron scattering there are no signs of higher harmonics @xcite .",
    "this experimental fact signals to a smooth variation of the charge - spin densities in the system .",
    "thus , the idea of well - defined , non - interacting stripes is misleading in the context of superconductivity .",
    "instead one should think of the `` stripes '' as a complex collective state that is driven by competing local interactions and cooperative long - range forces .",
    "the importance of the lattice degrees of freedom has been experimentally verified in essentially all cuprate superconductors and their insulating relatives @xcite . at this point in time",
    "most of the theoretical approaches either focus on electron - electron interactions and overlook the importance of lattice degrees of freedom or mainly electron - phonon interactions @xcite disregarding the importance of the strong ( short- and long - range ) interactions in the problem . some mean - field approaches ,",
    "however , have stressed the importance of electron - lattice interaction in the context of nickelates @xcite .",
    "we believe that electron - electron and electron - lattice interactions are equally important because of charge neutrality .",
    "charge neutrality implies that a charge modulated state such as the one defined in ( [ rhor ] ) has to be strongly coupled to the lattice .",
    "one would expect under general considerations that fluctuations of the ccs to appear in the phonon spectrum .",
    "indeed , consider the classical elastic lattice free energy : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lattice deviation from equilibrium position and @xmath38 the phonon dispersion relation .",
    "in the leading order the coupling between the smectic and lattice is quadratic in the displacements and can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the coupling constants .",
    "the problem of the ccs plus phonons can be solved exactly by a simple linear combination of the displacement fields .",
    "there are two branches of excitations with frequency given by @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to a splitting of the vibrational modes .",
    "therefore , the phonon spectrum should be directly affected by the presence of a ccs .",
    "thus , in dealing with the fluctuations of the ccs we have to consider the renormalizations of such fluctuations by the lattice .",
    "the full quantum mechanical problem can be quantized exactly like phonons in ordinary crystalline solids and the vibrations of the ccs can be described by @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for quantum vibrations of the ccs with momentum @xmath45 in the branch @xmath46 and energy @xmath47 .",
    "although the description of the collective state is rather simple because of its gaussian nature , the description of its internal degrees of freedom ( associated with the short length scales ) is more complex . in",
    "what follows we will make an _ ad hoc _ assumption that the internal charge excitations of this collective state can be divided into two main groups .",
    "firstly , in the regions where the charge density is large ( that is , given by the lines of constant phase in ( [ cp ] ) ) adw exist due to the local gain in kinetic energy .",
    "these regions we call stripes .",
    "these high density regions are characterized by single particle excitations ( not bound states ! ) and they are essentially confined to 1d lines because of the potential induced by strings @xcite . this highly anisotropic electronic fluid should be interacting because of the phase space constraints and in the absence of tunneling between stripes it is described by a luttinger liquid @xcite . in the regions of low density ( in the middle of the antiferromagnetic ladders ) single particle excitations are suppressed and bound states of holes are energetically more favorable .",
    "the simplest of them is a bound state of a pair of holes with d@xmath22 symmetry @xcite .",
    "larger bound state structures like quartets are unlikely to contribute because their quantum dynamics is exponentially suppressed ( tunneling matrix elements decay exponentially with the number of particles ) .",
    "moreover , we assume that this gas of bosons is essentially isotropic and only weakly coupled to the stripe fermions .",
    "the main reason of the weak coupling is related with the `` string healing '' process that generates the pairs in first place , that is , the bosons are essentially insensitive to the magnetic structure including the adw .",
    "we argue , however , that it is the weak coupling between bosons and stripes that ultimately produces superconductivity in the system .    from the electronic point of view",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig.[dos ] .",
    "the mott insulating state can be described by a filled lower hubbard band ( l.h.b . ) and an empty upper hubbard band ( u.h.b . ) that are separated by a large energy scale . in between these two bands",
    "there is a single electron band associated with the stripe fermions that we call the stripe band .",
    "the bound states of holes exist due to the transfer of spectral weight from the l.h.b . to a level above it with energy @xmath48 ( where @xmath45 is the momentum of the boson as we discuss below ) .",
    "the binding energy of the holes is the energy difference between the boson level and the top of the l.h.b .. the binding energy can be seen as mediated by the exchange of paramagnons @xcite and therefore is of the order of the characteristic magnetic energy in the problem @xcite . in the undoped system",
    "the characteristic energy is simply the exchange constant @xmath5 but as doping increases the magnetic energy scales are reduced driving the system from the mott insulator to a more ordinary fermi liquid state .",
    "the measure of the magnetic energy is the spin stiffness , @xmath49 , of the magnetic background .",
    "a finite spin stiffness produces the confining potential for the charge carriers of the form @xcite : @xmath50 ( modulus @xmath9 ) as shown in fig.[potential](a ) ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the total potential as seen by the holes is a superposition of the atomic potential of the lattice , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , and the magnetic confining potential of the strings . in fig.[potential](b ) we show in a simple kronig - penney picture the result of the superposition of these two potentials .",
    "when the temperature is larger than @xmath49 the holes are essentially deconfined .",
    "since the hole - pairs only exist at temperatures below @xmath49 it is important to estimate this energy scale . in order to do so",
    "let us consider the situation in fig.[anisotropy](a ) where the exchange within the antiferromagnetic regions is @xmath5 but across the stripe it is @xmath54 . at long wavelengths the problem maps into a spatially anisotropic heisenberg model with exchanges @xmath55 and @xmath56 as shown in fig.[anisotropy](b ) @xcite .",
    "while @xmath57 is a short length scale property and depends on the microscopic details @xcite the ratio @xmath58 depends on the long wavelength properties and determines the region of stability for antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effective spin stiffness of the magnetic background depends directly on @xmath46 . assuming that @xmath59 in fig.[anisotropy](b ) ( so that the exchange along the stripe is not modified by the presence of the stripes ) it is easy to show that @xcite @xmath60 this choice for the exchange constants was used in ref.@xcite and seems to explain well the data in lnsco @xcite . in the low hole doping regime ( @xmath61 )",
    "another choice has to be made since the magnetism is isotropic @xcite .",
    "it is clear from ( [ rhosa ] ) that a decrease in @xmath46 reduces the spin stiffness and can lead to a quantum phase transition to a spin liquid state @xcite .",
    "the main problem is how to relate @xmath46 of the effective model of fig.[anisotropy](b ) to the microscopic model of fig.[anisotropy](a ) .",
    "we use a simple scheme and compare the classical ground state energies of the two problems . in the case of fig.[anisotropy](a ) the hamiltonian is simply @xmath62 where @xmath63 in the antiferromagnetic ladders and @xmath64 across the adw . let us rewrite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a microscopic quantity that depends on details of the problem . with this parameterization it is clear that the classical ground state energy can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the classical energy of an isotropic antiferromagnet with @xmath69 spins and exchange @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath70 is the number of sites in each direction ( @xmath71 is the total number sites ) , @xmath72 is the number of stripes in the system ( @xmath73 is the separation between stripes in lattice units ) , and @xmath74 is the number of spins not residing in stripes ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "thus , from ( [ e0a ] ) one gets , @xmath76 on the other hand , for the effective model shown on fig.[anisotropy](b ) with the same number of sites we would have @xmath77 where we used ( [ alpha ] ) . comparing ( [ e0afinal ] ) and ( [ e0b ] ) we find @xmath78 this result implies from ( [ rhosa ] ) that @xmath79 them the spin stiffness vanishes at a critical distance @xmath80 between stripes given by @xmath81 since @xmath66 we see that @xmath82 ( quantum fluctuations increase the value of @xmath80 @xcite ) .",
    "the binding energy of the hole - pairs is proportional to @xmath49 and no bosons can exist at zero temperature when @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , we identify a temperature scale @xmath84 above which no bosons exist ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "so we relate the formation of the hole pairs as the `` pseudogap '' energy scale observed in many different experiments @xcite .",
    "our theory , however , breaks down when @xmath86 .    in the non - interacting picture ( with no hybridization between bosons and fermions )",
    "we can have two possibilities . in fig.[dos ]",
    "the boson state is empty of holes ( filled with electrons ) and the stripes are partially filled up to the chemical potential energy @xmath87 . because bosons and fermions are in thermodynamic equilibrium we work in the grand - canonical ensemble and keep the chemical potential fixed by letting the number of particles fluctuate .",
    "consider the case when @xmath88 the boson state is unoccupied and there are no bosons in the system .",
    "as the chemical potential is reduced ( more holes are introduced ) the stripes empty and further reduction of the chemical potential pins the energy at the boson level since as more holes are added they can only produce bound states . thus , there is a continuous transfer of spectral weight from the l.h.b . to the boson level . on the other hand ,",
    "if the binding energy of the holes increases nothing happens until @xmath89 . at this point",
    "there would be bosons and stripes co - existing with each other .",
    "when the binding energy is increased further the chemical potential follows since bosons become converted into stripe fermions .",
    "once again the chemical potential is pinned at the boson level .",
    "finally when the boson level reaches the top of the stripe band the stripes are completely filled and the adw disappears .",
    "in fact , because of the loss of kinetic energy the domain wall disappears even before this limit is reached @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that @xmath90 moreover , it is clear from this picture that the spin degrees of freedom that are responsible for the large magnetic response in these systems leave on the l.h.b . and are separated in energy from the charge degrees of freedom . therefore , the magnetism can be effectively `` traced out '' of the problem since it will only lead to kinematic renormalizations of the various parameters ( in other words , the spins follow the charge ) .",
    "the mechanism for superconductivity discussed in this work requires the coupling of stripe fermions via the exchange of bosons .",
    "one can think of this mechanism as the exchange of stripe `` pieces '' .",
    "coherence between the fermions requires the exchange of real bosons .",
    "the simplest mechanism for exchange is the decay of the bosons ( since they are composite particles ) into fermionic degrees of freedom at the stripes .",
    "this kind of mechanism can occur when two systems with very different ground states are separated by an interface .",
    "in fact , it was proposed long ago that a mechanism of this sort could generate superconductivity at a metal - semiconductor interface ( also called exciton superconductivity)@xcite .",
    "although this kind of proposal has generated controversy in the past @xcite there are good indications that they may be good candidates in the case of cuprates @xcite .",
    "moreover , the process described here is similar to the `` proximity effect '' mechanism proposed by ek if we neglect retardation effects due to the boson motion @xcite .",
    "one of our main results is : if the stripes static , that is , if we disregard the fluctuations of the ccs , this process is suppressed !",
    "the `` proximity effect '' mechanism can not happen with static stripes and real bosons .",
    "therefore for coherence to be attained we have to introduce fluctuations of the ccs .",
    "this makes our model radically different from the proximity effect proposed by ek since it involves distortions of the ccs and therefore of the lattice as well .",
    "moreover , unlike bcs , the phonons are not part of the binding mechanism that is driven by the exchange of composite fermion pairs .",
    "vibrations , however , are fundamental for the superconductivity .",
    "a natural consequence of the mechanism is that fluctuations of the order parameter are necessarily coupled to the fluctuations of the ccs and therefore vortices are coupled to dislocations of the stripe array . because the superfluid density is low , the interactions between topological defects ultimately determines the phase diagram .",
    "moreover , we claim that static stripes ( as the ones observed obtained in hartree - fock solutions of the @xmath3 and hubbard models @xcite or dmrg @xcite ) should be insulating due to a 1d cdw instability along the stripe direction .",
    "diagonal stripes do not couple to the bosons because they are oriented along the nodes of the boson wave - functions .    among other things",
    "we explain why phonon anomalies that have been observed in neutron scattering @xcite occur exactly at the same position in the brillouin zone where angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite observes the opening of the pseudogap ( that is , at @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "moreover , we show that the lattice distortions associated with the phonon anomalies are associated with the modulation of the superfluid density _ perpendicular _ to the stripes .",
    "the theory also predicts an isotope effect and the co - existence of commensurate and incommensurate spin fluctuations .",
    "the critical temperature for superconducting order , @xmath91 , is determined by the interplay between topological defects associated with the superfluid bosons ( vortices and anti - vortices ) and distortions of the ccs ( dislocation loops ) .",
    "the transition at finite temperatures is in the 3d xy universality class .",
    "we show that the amplitude of the order parameters is finite at temperatures above @xmath91 up to @xmath92 in the pseudogap region .",
    "moreover , at @xmath93 there is a quantum phase transition as a function of the separation between stripes , @xmath73 , that is directly related to the hole concentration @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "while the order parameters become finite for @xmath96 long - range order is only attained at @xmath97 .",
    "this quantum phase transition is in the 2d xy in a magnetic field universality class .",
    "thus , there is a crossover region at @xmath93 , @xmath98 , where topological defects prevent long - range order to develop .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the bosonic bound state of holes ; in section [ stfe ] we present the luttinger liquid representation of the stripe fermions ; in section [ coupl ] we discuss the nature of the coupling between bosons and stripe fermions and argue that vibrational degrees of freedom should enter explicitly ; in section [ mfield ] we solve the mean - field equations for the problem and determine the mean - field phase diagram ; in section [ phflu ] we discuss the phase fluctuations of the superfluid - superconducting state and how they relate to the phase fluctuations of the ccs ; in section [ hight ] the nature of the high temperature transition is discussed ; section [ lowt ] contains the results for the zero temperature transition ; section [ conclu ] contains our conclusions .",
    "consider the problem of two holes in an antiferromagnet .",
    "the energy is minimized by the formation a bound state that moves freely through the system @xcite .",
    "one can define an operator that creates such a state at the top of the antiferromagnetic vacuum that is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 destroys an electron ( creates a hole ) with momentum @xmath45 and spin projection @xmath101 ( @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) in the antiferromagnet .",
    "@xmath104 is the area of the system .",
    "the wavefunction of the pair , @xmath105 , is normalized ( @xmath106 ) and in principle depends on the relative and total momentum of the pair .",
    "this wave - function can be obtained variationally @xcite or by solving the bethe - salpeter equation for the binding of two holes @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the wave - function on the total momentum is due to the fact that on the lattice the symmetry of the bound state varies with its center of mass momentum and depends strongly on the microscopic details . for the su(2 ) @xmath3 model it is known that the d@xmath22-state has the lowest energy @xcite while in the ising @xmath3 model the p - wave is the ground state @xcite .",
    "the matter of the fact is that the s - wave state is always the state with highest energy and the reason is fairly simple to understand : the strong local repulsion requires the wave - function of the pair to be centered at different sites . in other words , s - wave",
    "bound states are suppressed by the magnetism . here",
    "we assume the pairs to have d@xmath22 symmetry .",
    "it is easy to see that operator defined in ( [ pk ] ) is not completely bosonic because of its composite nature @xcite .",
    "since the electrons obey anti - commutation relations ( @xmath107 ) it is easy to show that commutation relations of the bosons is given by : @xmath108&=&\\delta_{{\\bf k},{\\bf k ' } } - d_{{\\bf k},{\\bf k ' } } \\label{bos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 here @xmath110 is the number operator for holes ( @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the number operator for electrons ) . since the magnitude of @xmath113 is proportional to density of holes in the antiferromagnet",
    ", @xmath113 is smaller than @xmath94 , the total number of holes in the system .",
    "moreover , the largest fraction of holes is actually residing in the stripes . since ( [ dkk ] )",
    "is much smaller than one , the violation of the bosonic commutation relations can be disregarded and we can treat the bound states as real bosons . at this point",
    "it is convenient to count the number , @xmath114 , of fermions in the system . assuming that there are @xmath115 stripes of size @xmath70 ( in lattice units ) the number of antiferromagnetic sites is @xmath116 and the total number of fermions",
    "is : @xmath117 where the factor of @xmath118 comes from the composite nature of the bosons and the last term is the number of fermions in the stripes ( see below ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the composite bosons can be written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the dispersion relation of the bosons and @xmath121 is the local repulsion between pairs . in ( [ hp ] )",

    "there is a critical value of the hopping above which the system becomes a superfluid .",
    "however , even a small amount of disorder suppresses the mott insulator - superfluid transition by the creation of an insulating state .",
    "disorder is unavoidable in these systems since the charge comes from counter - ions out of the cuo@xmath6 planes .",
    "thus , the conclusion is that if the bosons are decoupled from the stripes the bose system is in the insulating bose glass state .",
    "as we have argued the single particle excitations at the regions of high density of the ccs is due to the magnetic confinement @xcite . in the absence of the ccs",
    "the holes can move freely with hopping energy @xmath4 in both in the @xmath94 and @xmath8 directions and the brillouin zone is defined for @xmath133 . in the presence of the ccs the translation symmetry of the lattice perpendicular to the ordering vector is broken .",
    "suppose that the stripes are separated by a distance @xmath9 .",
    "then the new brillouin zone is given by @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "thus the original band has to be folded back into this zone and gaps open in the single particle spectrum generating @xmath73 new bands .    when @xmath136 the tunneling between stripes is suppressed because of the large distance .",

    "thus , @xmath149 is a smooth function and its variation with @xmath73 can be ignored .",

    "the stripe fermion dispersion relation can be written as @xmath154 and it is strongly anisotropic as long as @xmath155 ( this is always true for @xmath156 ) .",
    "in the limit of @xmath136 the transverse component can be completely disregarded and the fermi surface is obtained by filling up all the states up to @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the fermi momentum ( see fig.[bz](a ) ) . moreover ,",
    "the fermi surface is open along @xmath159 since the system has no dispersion in that direction .",
    "if the stripes are oriented along the diagonals on a square lattice then in momentum space the dispersion looks like the one given in fig.[bz](b ) .",
    "then it is convenient to rotate the orientation of the lattice by @xmath160 and to change the lattice spacing from @xmath10 to @xmath161 .",
    "introduction of @xmath140 leads to a change in the curvature of the fermi surface by an amount @xmath162 close to the fermi points .",
    "as it has been noted in the context of organic superconductors @xcite the strong anisotropy of the hopping produces strong dependence of the physical properties with temperature . at high temperatures , that is , @xmath163 , the uncertainty on the transverse momentum is larger than the size of the brillouin zone , @xmath164 , and the curvature of the fermi surface is blurred by thermal effects . in this case",
    "the motion of the electrons perpendicular to the stripes becomes incoherent and electrons become confined by thermal effects to a region of size @xmath9 .",

    "a luttinger liquid can also include umklapp terms .",
    "the umklapp terms are only important at commensurate fillings and especially at half - filling when they are responsible for the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "however , half - filling for the stripes implies that there is one electron per site , that is , the stripe is depopulated .",
    "this can only happen if the boson level crosses the chemical potential and the stripe state becomes unstable . throughout the paper we assume that the stripe state is stable and therefore away from half - filling .",
    "experiments by tranquada and collaborators in lnsco indicate that the stripe filling is @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "thus , we disregard the umklapp processes .",
    "the importance of the backscattering term can be readily understood by a simple perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) calculation .",
    "it is a simple exercise to show that if we shrink the bandwidth of the stripe electrons from @xmath197 to @xmath198 the coupling constant @xmath195 renormalizes according to @xcite @xmath199 where @xmath200 .",
    "thus , @xmath195 is irrelevant for @xmath201 and relevant for @xmath202 . for repulsive interactions it turns out that @xmath201 and therefore the interaction is irrelevant and the system is described by a gapless luttinger liquid . if interactions are attractive @xmath202 and the backscattering is relevant leading to the opening of a _ spin gap _ in the system signaling tendency to superconducting fluctuations .",
    "we have started from a repulsive model and therefore we assume all the interactions to be repulsive throughout the paper . although the backscattering term is irrelevant it is well - known that the slowest decaying correlation function for a repulsive interacting luttinger liquid is the cdw one ( it is equivalent to the case of @xmath203 ) .",
    "if the cdw is commensurate with the lattice ( as it seems to be in the case of lsco ) then the lattice pinning is strong and the system becomes insulating @xcite .",
    "if the cdw is incommensurate then a luttinger liquid state is possible but any amount of disorder will lead to cdw pinning driving the system again towards an insulating regime .",
    "this is certainly undesirable from the phenomenological point of view since these materials are still metallic at finite temperatures .",
    "many approaches that start from a purely 1d description of the stripes are confronted with this serious problem @xcite .",
    "these approaches usually invoke the introduction of long - range interactions among the stripes .",
    "it is hard to reconcile the long range interactions between different stripes with the short range interacting within the stripes . for that to happen the dielectric function of the material should be extremelly anisotropic ( experimentally it is known that this is not the case @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that once the long - range forces have done their work in creating the stripe array the final metallic state screens any long - range forces left , leading the system to purely local interactions .",
    "if the inter - stripe interactions remain long - range the ground state should be a wigner crystal @xcite instead of a cdw and in both cases the stripes should be insulating .",
    "we stick with the assumption that after the ccs is formed the interactions between the elementary excitations discussed here are local .",
    "the ground state is a cdw state and therefore insulating .",
    "in fact this is the picture that arises from mean - field approaches to the stripe problem since in these mean - field studies the stripes are non - interacting @xcite .    in the case of the ccs state where there are an infinite number of stripes we add a new index to the fermion operator , @xmath204 , where @xmath130 labels the particular stripe .",
    "the fourier transform of the electron operator can be defined as @xmath205 where the anti - commutation relations are preserved ( @xmath206 and @xmath207 ) .",
    "as we have discussed in the last two sections in the absence of coupling between stripe fermions and bosons the ground state is insulating : a bose - mott insulator in the antiferromagnetic regions and a cdw state along the stripes . in order to determine the coupling between bosons and fermions we consider simple arguments based on conservation of momentum and energy .",
    "as we have argued , the nature of the elementary excitations in the problem depends strongly on their position in real space . on the one hand ,",
    "bound pair bosons are not eigenstates of the luttinger liquid . on the other hand , luttinger liquid bosons ( collective sound waves ) are not elementary excitations of the doped mott insulator .",
    "thus , the simplest process that couples these two types of excitations is a decay process in which bosons are continuously transformed in stripe fermions and vice - versa .",
    "let us consider the case of static stripes .",
    "the relevant coupling that conserves linear momentum can be written as : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the boson - stripe coupling that , by conservation of angular momentum , has d@xmath22 symmetry ( that is , @xmath210 ) .",
    "this is a four - fermion coupling in terms of the original operators ( see ( [ pk ] ) ) and describes a fermionic scattering process where in the final state two electrons always end up in a bound state .",
    "this kind of coupling looks unusual because there are only annihilation operators and it corresponds to the vertex shown in fig.[process](a ) .",
    "it only happens this way because we use the electrons as assymptotic states in the scattering process .",
    "in fact , ( [ firstry ] ) is similar to fermion - boson models that have appeared in the literature of superconductivity over the years @xcite .",
    "notice that since the boson is composed of holes the direction of the current is inverted ( holes moving forward are equivalent to electrons moving backward and vice - versa ) .",
    "thus to destroy a boson is equivalent to create two electrons in the antiferromagnetic background . in the process ( [ firstry ] )",
    "a pair of holes is destroyed in the antiferromagnet while a pair of electrons from the stripe hop into the antiferromagnetic media ( see fig.[process](b ) ) .",
    "let us assume that the coupling between bosons and stripes is weak so that the important degrees of freedom only exist close to the chemical potential .",
    "thus , when a boson hits a stripe there are two main process for decaying . in the first one the two stripe fermions have opposite momentum , that is , @xmath211 and @xmath212 ( as shown in fig.[process](b ) ) .",
    "thus , linear momentum conservation implies @xmath213 .",
    "moreover , angular momentum can not be conserved in the scattering process because , relative to the stripe , the two outgoing holes have zero angular momentum while the pair have finite angular momentum .",
    "therefore , we need a sink of momentum .",
    "the other process corresponds to boson decay into two fermion moving in the same direction , that is , @xmath211 and @xmath214 .",
    "this process implies @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "this is equivalent to a boson moving in the antiferromagnetic ladder parallel to the stripe .",
    "since the boson wave - function is restricted to the antiferromagnetic region the amplitude of this coupling is suppressed .",
    "the conclusion from this argument is that for a static stripe the decay processes have vanishing phase space .",
    "consider also the difference between longitudinal and diagonal stripes as shown in fig.[cou ] .",
    "for a longitudinal stripe the coupling between bosons and stripes is possible because the stripes are oriented along the lobes of the boson d@xmath22 wavefunction while in the diagonal case the stripes are oriented along the nodes .",
    "thus , the coupling between diagonal stripes is further reduced as compared to the longitudinal case .",
    "therefore , for diagonal stripes superconductivity is not possible in our model because of the nature of the boson wave - function .",
    "in fact , recent neutron scattering experiments observe diagonal stripes in the insulating phase of lsco while vertical and horizontal stripes are observed in the superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , notice that for a given orientation of the boson wavefunction , horizontal ( vertical ) stripes couple to the positive ( negative ) lobe of the wavefunction .",
    "as we pointed out above we need a sink ( a particle or collective mode ) for the momentum transferred from the bosons .",
    "moreover , since the bosons are spinless the particle that carries the momentum can not be a spin - wave or paramagnon .",
    "the simplest choice is a vibrational mode : the boson collides with the stripe , breaks into two fermions and produces a vibration .",
    "this vibration is due to the fluctuations of the smectic phase of the stripe array .",
    "again , as we stressed previously , stripes are not isolated objects that are independent of each other",
    ". long - range forces , like the coulomb , the casimir or simply entropic repulsion keeps them apart and generate a finite stiffness .    consider the coupling of the bosons with the stripe fermions when the stripe fluctuates a distance @xmath17 from its equilibrium position .",
    "we write the local coupling as @xmath217 where we ensure that the coupling occurs at the position of the stripes .",
    "if we assume that ccs fluctuations are small compared to the periodicity in the system , that is , @xmath218 , the stripes fluctuate in a distance scale much smaller than the inter - stripe distance .",
    "we can expand the dirac delta function .",
    "the first term is just the static stripe problem we discussed above and , as we argued , has no phase space .",
    "we therefore keep the next term in the expansion leading to a coupling of the form @xmath219 where @xmath220 when @xmath221 is the stripe - vibration coupling constant .",
    "the two processes associated with the interaction in ( [ couplings ] ) are shown in fig.[cpp ] .    before we study ( [ couplings ] ) in detail it is worth investigating the problem via second order time dependent perturbation theory .",
    "the transition probability between non - perturbed states in the system is given by : @xmath222 } { ( -e_{{\\bf k}}\\pm \\omega_{{\\bf p},\\alpha } + \\epsilon_{q_x}+\\epsilon_{k_x+p_x - q_x})^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath223 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "observe that the probability amplitude only grows with time for states such that @xmath224 where the plus ( minus ) sign implies absorption ( emission ) of a vibration . remembering that @xmath225 we obtain the condition that @xmath226 .",
    "moreover , because @xmath227 vanishes at @xmath228 the largest coupling between bosons and stripes happens at _ finite _ momentum .",
    "indeed , the coupling increases as one goes towards the brillouin zone edge .",
    "thus , the largest coupling in the problem occurs at @xmath229 , that is , _",
    "perpendicular _ to the stripes .",
    "it may be somewhat surprising that the most important part of the physics occurs in a direction perpendicular to the orientation of the stripes but this effect has been already observed in numerical simulations of spin - fermion models with stripe formation @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that in the case of the boson condensation we should expect it to occur close at @xmath230 ( as photo - emission experiments indicate @xcite ) but not only that : we expect a ccs distortion at the same wave - vector so that the momentum carried by the superfluid bosons is transfered to the lattice .",
    "thus , there can be a double condensation : the superfluid density is modulated with finite wave - vector @xmath230 and the ccs deforms in order to follow the variation of the superfluid density .",
    "therefore a condensation of the ccs at finite wave - vector will induce phonon anomalies at the same wave - vector .",
    "thus , we expect phonon softening close to @xmath2 together with the condensation of bosons in the same point in momentum space . in the normal state",
    "the situation is depicted in fig.[abovetc ] : there is no superfluidity and no lattice distortions . in the ordered phase we expect the situation shown in fig.[belowtc ] where the superfluid density is modulated with wavelength @xmath231 in the direction perpendicular to the stripes and the lattice",
    "is distorted in the same direction with the same wave - vector .",
    "notice that there is a doubling of the unit cell in the direction perpendicular to the stripes and therefore the ccs is dimerized .",
    "this effect is similar to the peierls distortion in 1d systems or the jahn - teller effect where there is a lowering of the symmetry with a simultaneous gain in energy @xcite . in momentum space",
    "the situation is depicted in fig.[cond ] : phonon anomalies and superfluidity should appear at same point on the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "observe that due to the conservation of energy , @xmath232 , and the stability condition ( [ condition ] ) is satisfied only if emission is allowed .",
    "one can generate a boson by creating two electrons at the stripe at the cost of absorption of a vibration .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the diagram in fig.[dos ] where in order to create a boson two electrons occupying the boson state have to be excited to the fermi surface by the absorption of a vibration .",
    "conversely , two holes from the stripe hop into the antiferromagnetic ladder and form a boson .",
    "thus , our conclusion is that the most relevant coupling in this problem is given by @xmath233",

    "we have shown that phase fluctuations prevent long range order to appear until the distance between stripes reach the critical value @xmath428 ( given in ( [ zteq ] ) ) where phase coherence is established . for @xmath420 a crossover region appears in the phase diagram where incoherent bosons co - exist with stripe fluctuations .",
    "the phase transtion at zero temperature is in the 2d xy in a magnetic field universality class .",
    "so far the discussion has been based on the idea of infinite 1d stripe segments . for this geometry",
    "it is not possible to have a true d@xmath22 superconducting order parameter as it has been experimentally observed @xcite because the fermi surface is flat . for a flat fermi surface like the one shown in fig.[bz](a ) the superconductivity would have s - wave symmetry since the whole fermi surface would be gapped .",
    "in fact this is another major problem in approaches to the cuprate problem starting with 1d stripes , that is , how can one get a d - wave order parameter out of a 1d problem . in that aspect",
    "our theory indeed predicts a s - wave order parameter for infinite 1d stripes . if the small transverse tunneling @xmath434 given in ( [ tpern ] )",
    "is included , the fermion dispersion relation is modified to ( [ dispersion2d ] ) and a curvature is introduced in the fermi surface allowing for a very anisotropic d - wave state @xcite .",
    "observe , however , that because @xmath140 is exponentially small with @xmath73 , changes in the fermi surface shape will only become observable when @xmath435 where the system is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "this is not sufficient to explain the isotropic d - wave state that is observed in the underdoped cuprates .    in reality , because of the presence of twin boundaries , we would expect domain formation with stripes running along the crystalographic directions ( as it seems to be confirmed in neutron scattering experiments in ybco @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of microscopic twins and tweeds in the lattice structure of these systems seem to be intrinsic to the strong lattice constraints .",
    "this situation is quite similar to what occurs in some martensitic systems @xcite .",
    "we can think of the twin boundaries as junctions between two superconductors .",
    "since the twin boundary size , @xmath436 , is very large ( much larger than any of the superconducting length scales ) each mono - domain can be treated as a separate superconductor that is coupled to other domains through the twin boundary . because the coherence length in these systems is of the order of the lattice spacing",
    ", the superconducting order parameter can be continuously depressed near the twin boundary leading to a situation similar to a superconducting - normal - superconducting junction . as we can see in fig.[cou](a ) a d@xmath22 boson couples to the positive lobe of the wave - function to the horizontal stripes .",
    "thus , when phase coherence is achieved the whole fermi surface in fig.[bz](a ) will have the same phase sign ( say , positive like in fig.[cou](a ) ) .",
    "when the bosons cross the twin boundary and find a stripe oriented along the vertical direction the negative lobe of the wave - function couples to the vertical stripe .",
    "this situation is shown in fig.[je ] .",
    "therefore adjacent domains will have opposite phases across the twin boundary as shown in fig.[junction ] .",
    "thus , if we superimpose the fermi surfaces of the horizontal and vertical stripes we find a situation like in fig.[dwave ] where horizontal and vertical fermi surfaces will have opposite sign in their phases .",
    "the situation is identitical to a @xmath437-junction between two superconductors @xcite but the phase difference between the different domains is zero .",
    "it is the symmetry of the boson bound state that determines the d - wave superconductor order parameter .",
    "notice that in the presence of twin boundaries the electronic motion is actually 2d since stripe holes are being transfered from vertical to horizontal stripes via the bosons .",
    "thus , there is true propagation along the diagonals . in the disordered phase",
    "this propagation is not coherent and the system remains essentially 1d . in the superconducting state , however , the coherence between the domains is attained and quasiparticles can propagate along the diagonals as in a ordinary superconductor .",
    "thus , our conclusion is that in the presence of unavoidable microscopic twin boundaries no quasi - particle peak is possible in the pseudo - gap phase while in the superconducting state the quasi - particle peak should exist .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the arpes data @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this mechanism is that the size of the d - wave order parameter should change with the relative number of domains . in samples where there are equal amounts of vertical and horizontal domains",
    "the superconducting order parameter is symmetric ( see fig.[defdw](a ) ) .",
    "if there are more domains in one direction than in another the d - wave order parameter should be assymetric with a larger lobe in one of the directions as shown in fig.[defdw](b ) .",
    "in fact , a s - wave component for the order parameter should also develop since for a mono - domain system we would predict a fully s - wave order parameter . we should also point out that c - axis coupling can lead to further increase of the condensation energy in the system .",
    "in fact hopping along the c - axis can help to stabilize the d - wave order parameter @xcite .    although @xmath91 is weakly depedent on the twin boundaries in the sample , the transport properties the critical currents and fields will depend strongly on them .",
    "let us consider a simple model for the junction between a vertical and a horizontal domain .",
    "the free energy for the junction is written as @xmath438 where @xmath439 is the critical current and @xmath181 is the phase difference between domains .",
    "the critical current density is @xmath440 where @xmath441 is the distance between the cuo@xmath6 planes ( for simplicity we assume that @xmath442 ) . in the presence of an electromagnetic vector potential @xmath443",
    "the josephson current between two different domains is simply given by @xmath444 where @xmath445 is the line that links the two domains and @xmath446 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "choosing a gauge such that @xmath447 at the junction , assuming that the twin boundary has width @xmath448 and that the variations of the order parameter across the twin boundary are negligible , we have from ( [ jc ] ) and ( [ iplane ] ) : @xmath449 that leads to a penetration depth , @xmath450 , given by @xmath451 moreover , the variation of the phase across the twin boundary is @xmath452 but because this variation occurs in a length scale of the correlation length induced by the josephson coupling , @xmath453 , we expect that @xmath454 thus , the ginzburg - landau parameter , @xmath455 , is given by @xmath456 leading to a critical field , @xmath457 , for the field strength that is screened by surface currents given by @xmath458 finally , the critical field for the penetration of one flux of quanta through the twin boundary is of order @xmath459 thus , we expect @xmath460 to be much smaller than the upper critical field required for the extinction of long range order in the system .",
    "it is clear that many macroscopic properties of the superconductor are determined by what happens at the twin boundaries .",
    "as we have argued the formation of the stripes is driven by the gain in kinetic energy and therefore favors anti - phase domain walls as shown in fig.[anisotropy](a ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic fluctuations are incommensurate with the lattice as it has been observed for a long time in all the cuprates @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that there are lattice distortions in the system that we can associate with the o motion as shown in fig.[belowtc ] .",
    "if the stripes are site centered then the distortion does not affect the incommensurate spin order since the cu atoms are unaffected .",
    "however , if the the stripes are bond centered ( as some numerical @xcite as well as analytical works @xcite indicate ) then the dimerization will produce _ commensurate _ magnetic response .",
    "this can be seen in a schematic way in fig.[comag ] where a dislocation loop of the ccs produces excess of one magnetic domain ( a domain with a given staggered magnetization ) over the other @xcite .",
    "thus , for bond centered stripes the dislocation loops will produce a dynamic commensurate response .",
    "the presence of dynamical commensurate spin fluctuations have been observed in ybco @xcite but not in lsco .",
    "it might well be that stripes are bond centered in ybco and site centered in lsco .",
    "this would explain the difference between these two materials in regards to the presence of commensurate spin fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "it is clear from our theory that the vibrations will be affected by an isotope effect ( see ( [ du ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , because a static lattice distortion is involved we also expect the critical temperature for the distortions , @xmath461 , to be strongly affected by changes of o isotopes ( changes of o@xmath462 by o@xmath463 ) .",
    "there is strong evidence for the o isotope effect in lsco and other cuprates that support our theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , we expect the isotope effect to be stronger at the @xmath93 transition to the superconducting state at @xmath411 where the static lattice distortions start to appear",
    ". however , the superconducting transition itself should be very weakly dependent on the isotope effect because the binding mechanism only involves the lattice in a indirect way ( in other words , the stiffness of the superfluid is only weakly renormalized by the lattice ) .",
    "the experimental data in cuprates have indeed shown an unusual isotope effect where the critical superconducting temperature is not correlated with isotope effect that becomes stronger at the quantum critical point associated with superconductivity @xcite .",
    "in fact , optimally doped cuprates show very weak signs of the isotope effect .",
    "this has been used as an argument against phonon mechanisms for superconductivity . in our theory at @xmath93 a static lattice distortion appears together with the superconductivity ( see fig.[finaldiag ] ) .",
    "it is the transition into this dimerized stripe phase that will be strongly affected by the isotope effect , not the superconducting one .",
    "thus , we can explain the the unusual isotope effect in cuprates as a consequence of the unavoidable coupling between lattice and the superconducting condensate .",
    "it is clear from the phase diagram shown in fig.[finaldiag ] that our theory does not describe the so - called overdoped region of the cuprates .",
    "when the distance between the stripes becomes of the order of the lattice spacing the system becomes homogeneous .",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlation lenght , for instance , is short and the bound states disappear from the spectrum by merging with the lower hubbard band ( this coincides with the vanishing of the pseudogap energy scale ) . beyond this point",
    "we believe there is a crossover to a conventional bcs behavior with a well defined fermi surface and therefore to fermi liquid behavior in the normal phase @xcite .",
    "this smooth crossover is possibly the same one that occurs between a bose - einstein system and a bcs superconductor @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented a new model for a collective electronic state of the cuprates where the elementary excitations change from place to place in real space .",
    "we show that the decaying processes among these elementary excitations produce superconducting correlations even when the interactions are repulsive .",
    "we show that the d - wave nature of the order parameter is associated with the d - wave nature of boson bound states that exist due to the magnetic confinement in the system .",
    "we have shown that phase fluctuations are responsible for the quantum disorder and that the phase diagram depends strongly on how vortices couple to dislocation loops .",
    "we have explained various different experimental facts of the cuprates and predicted new effects that might prove or disprove our theory .",
