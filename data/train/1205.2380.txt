    "in the fascinating many - body world , the interplay between few- and many - body physics is known to play a very important role in a variety of systems and is instrumental to our understanding of diversified emergent phenomena .",
    "the best known example perhaps is the superconductivity phenomenon where the cooper bound states due to the pauli blocking effect lead to pairing correlations and therefore superconductivity in solids @xcite .",
    "quantum degenerate gases of ultra cold atoms near feshbach resonance that have been explored in many laboratories during the past decade @xcite are another fantastic platform to scrutinize the intriguing interplay between few- and many - body physics . although far away from resonances , the physical properties of quantum gases can be well described by the existing dilute gas theories , very little , except in a few limiting cases , has been known about the fundamental properties of quantum gases near resonance beyond the usual dilute limit .",
    "the complexity of this topic to a large extent appears to be two - fold :    \\1 ) the role of few - body physics ( two - body , three - body states etc ) in many - body systems . in other words , to what extent does the underlying few - body physics influence the many - body correlations and which channel dictates the many - body properties near resonance ?",
    "\\2 ) the effect of many - body background on the few - body structures . how are the few - body structures or multiple scatterings affected by the presence of many other identical particles ?    these two issues can be treated successfully and separately in the usual dilute limit .",
    "for instance , in the leading order , one can neglect the effect of finite - density background atoms on multiple scatterings or underlying few - body structures ; the energy density can therefore be calculated perturbatively by assuming the few - body scatterings are given by their properties in the vacuum and applying the low density expansion .",
    "the effects of few - body structures on many - body physics can be explored perturbatively .",
    "one can also further study the leading effect of quantum gases on dimers and trimers because the many - body states in the dilute limit are well - known .",
    "however , near resonance , these two issues are generically entangled and ideally have to be addressed self - consistently , which usually becomes very challenging .    in this article",
    ", we make an attempt to understand the fundamental properties of bose gases near feshbach resonance via examining the intriguing interplay between the few- and many - body physics in bose gases at large positive scattering lengths . for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce a simple self - consistent renormalization - group - equation approach to address both sides of the coin .",
    "many - body properties of a quantum gas are shown to influence the renormalization flow of few - body running coupling constants resulting in the change of the sign of the effective two - body interaction constants .",
    "that in return completely dictates the many - body physics near resonance and leads to peculiar features in the chemical potentials . and we limit ourselves to the resonances with a very short effective range .    a key concept we are going to focus on is the effective interaction between condensed atoms near resonance .",
    "the common believe is although the underlying short range resonance interaction has to be attractive , at low energy scales the two - body interaction is effectively repuslive when the scattering length @xmath1 is positive .",
    "the argument runs as the following . the phase shift due to a short range attractive",
    "potential is given as @xmath2 which yields @xmath3 when @xmath4 is small .",
    "the phase shift approaches @xmath5 when @xmath6 is much bigger than unity but much smaller compared to @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the range of the attractive interaction .",
    "the low energy phase shift @xmath3 turns out also to be the phase shift of any repulsive interaction with the same positive scattering length . and",
    "so the atoms interact effectively repulsively if one is interested in the scatterings at small @xmath4 .",
    "however , the phase shifts of a short range attractive potential and a repuslive interation can become significantly different whenever @xmath6 is bigger than unity ; for instance , for a hardcore potential with radius @xmath9 , @xmath3 for all momenta , differing from the value of @xmath5 for atttractive potentials when @xmath10 . near resonance ,",
    "@xmath1 approaches infinity and the issue of the effective interaction between condensed atoms becomes very subtle .",
    "indeed , near resonance we show that condensed atoms no longer interact with an effective repulsive interaction even when the scattering lengths are positive , a somewhat surprising conculsion to many .",
    "the theory of dilute bose gases has a long history .",
    "the theory for weakly interacting bosons was established by bogoliubov more than half century ago @xcite . a properly regularized theory of dilute gases of bosons with contact interactions",
    "was first put forward by lee , huang and yang  @xcite and later by beliaev  @xcite who developed a field - theoretical approach .",
    "higher order corrections were further examined in later years  @xcite .",
    "since these results were obtained by applying an expansion in terms of the small parameter @xmath11 ( here @xmath12 is the density and @xmath1 is the scattering length ) , it is not surprising that formally speaking each of the terms appearing in the dilute gas theory diverges when the scattering lengths are extrapolated to infinity .",
    "this aspect of the dilute gas theory , to a large extent , is the main reason why a qualitative understanding of bose gases near resonance had been missing for long .",
    "in fact , the issue of quantum gases beyond the usual dilute limit has been one of the most outstanding unresolved problems in the quantum many - body physics .",
    "a few preliminary experimental attempts have been recently made to explore the properties of bose gases beyond the dilute limit thanks to the availability of feshbach resonances in many cold - atom laboratories  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that when approaching resonance from the molecular side , bose atoms appear to be thermalized within a reasonably short time , well before the recombination processes set in , so to form a quasi - static condensate .",
    "furthermore , the life time due to the recombination processes is much longer than the many - body time scale set by the degeneracy temperature which motivates us to explore the thermodynamic properties of the quasi equilibrium gases .",
    "here we intend to illustrate the intimate entanglement between few - body structures and many - body physics in a single approach .",
    "these illustrations suggest that most of the surprising features of near - resonance bose gases can be understood in terms of the spectrum flow of few - body structures such as dimers , trimers which can be strongly influenced by the interactions with the condensates .",
    "the device we rely on to draw a qualitative picture is the renormalized interaction constant .",
    "the two - fold complexities mentioned above are actually two sides of one coin and thus can not be completely separated , although many theoretical attempts towards better understanding of near - resonance unitary gases have been focused on either of these two aspects .",
    "for instance , the role of three - body physics in bose gases in the dilute limit has been explored and the contribution of efimov states  @xcite to the many - body energy density was estimated in the low density limit  @xcite .",
    "it was further discovered that the energy density of unitary fermi gases can be directly related to an asymptotic property of the reduced two - atom correlation function , which illustrates the important role of universal few - body physics in the many - body limit  @xcite .",
    "the interesting interplay between two - body physics and many - body physics explored in spectroscopy experiments was emphasized  @xcite .",
    "a few separated efforts have also been made with an emphasis on the other side of the coin , i.e. how few - body structures respond to the presence of a quantum background , i.e. either statistical or dynamical effects .",
    "these studies have led to the findings of anomalous dimers with tunable masses and new universal behaviours of efimov states in quantum mixtures @xcite .",
    "it remained to be seen whether these predictions can be tested in future experiments .",
    "furthermore , it was also shown that these anomalous few - body states can qualitatively modify the low energy multiple scattering phase shifts  @xcite .",
    "the approach outlined in this article is an alternative to the more elaborated diagrammatic resummation that was previously carried out by the authors and their collaborators in ref .",
    "the two approaches yield almost identical results . in section",
    "ii , we first carry out a simple scaling argument , as a caricature of resonating bose gases , illustrating the relevance of fermionization in bose gases near resonance and discuss the limitation of the coarse grain procedure .",
    "we also remark on a close relation between the effective two - body interactions and lee - huang - yang corrections in ref .  @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the energetics of dimers and trimers in condensates and explore the implications on the many - body physics .",
    "especially , we point out that in addition to the fermionization phenomenon , an instability sets in at a positive critical scattering length as a signature of formation of dimers in condensates .",
    "we also show this aspect is a consequence of the sign - change of the renormalized two - body interactions between the condensed atoms ; the effect of condensates on the two - body interaction constant is investigated via taking into account the self energy of dimers and via imposing an infrared boundary condition for the renormalization flow . in section",
    "v , we summarize the results of diagrammatic resummation .",
    "we employ a set of self - consistent equations to address the two issues listed at the beginning of the article .",
    "these self - consistent equations were first introduced by the authors and their collaborators in ref .",
    "@xcite . to make it accessible to general readers ,",
    "we leave the most technical part in the appendix and outline the framework of the approach and result in this section . in section",
    "vi , we conclude our studies .",
    "the energetics of bose gases near resonance can be qualitatively understood via a coarse grain procedure which is more or less equivalent to the real space renormalization transformation .",
    "the simplest implementation of this is to first divide a quantum gas into n blocks each of which is of the size of @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the coherence length and @xmath15 is the chemical potential . because the chemical potential is a non - additive thermodynamic quantity , it is natural to define it as the change of energy when adding an additional atom to a particular block and the effect of other blocks is to set an appropriate boundary condition .",
    "therefore , the chemical potential can be considered as the interaction energy between the added atom and existing atoms in the block .",
    "if we further assume the interaction energy is dictated by a pairwise one , then    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the characteristic interaction energy between two atoms in the block and @xmath18 is the number of atoms in the block with @xmath12 being the number density .",
    "this is a standard coarse grain procedure which relates a microscopic quantity @xmath19 and a thermo - dynamic quantity , the chemical potential @xmath15 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath20 itself is a full many - body problem that is usually very difficult to carry out . in the dilute limit",
    "however , one can show that when two atoms interact in a box of size @xmath21 , the probability of being scattered by the third particle is negligible because the mean free path @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 ( @xmath1 is the scattering length ) much longer than @xmath21 .",
    "in fact ,    @xmath24    which is small in the low density dilute limit .",
    "so at least in this limit , we can approximate @xmath25 as the energy of two interacting atoms @xmath26 in an empty box of the size of the block .",
    "if we assume this is also qualitatively correct even in the unitary limit , then we have a very simple self - consistent equation ; the only knowledge we need to solve this equation is how two atoms interact in a box of size @xmath21 at arbitrary scattering length @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath27 for a contact resonance interaction can be worked out , either by assuming two atoms are in a harmonic trap of harmonic length @xmath21 or in a block of size @xmath21 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviours are universal up to numerical prefactors . for two atoms in a block of size @xmath28 ,    @xmath29    @xmath30 are two positive prefactors depending on the details of the block and are of little importance for our qualitative discussions here .",
    "it is important to notice that at resonance , @xmath31 is finite and scales like the kinetic energy of an atom moving in an empty box of size @xmath21 .    substituting the results in eq .",
    "( [ 2body ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) , one obtains the estimate of chemical potential . in the dilute limit ,",
    "@xmath32    the correction to the first hartree - fock term is the leading finite size correction to the interaction energy and belongs to the well - known lee - huang - yang effect .",
    "when @xmath1 approaches infinity on the other hand , this simple procedure leads to the prediction of fermionization . that is @xmath33 which scales as the fermi energy of a quantum gas with the same density and mass .",
    "although crude , the coarse grain shown here points to a phenomenon that was previously seen in a few numerical calculations . given that it is very simple , we consider it quite a success .",
    "the relevance of fermionization to bose gases near resonance was observed in a few theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "this aspect of bose gases near resonance is also an essential feature of tonks - girardeau gases or hardcore bosons in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional bose fluids were later further studied using the luttinger liquid formulation @xcite ; the renormalization of microscopic parameters also plays a very important role in the construction of that theory although the implementation was carried out very differently from what we are going to focus on below .",
    "but how good is the starting point that near resonance we can approximate @xmath34 as the two - particle interaction in an empty box completely neglecting the effect of many other identical particles ? to address this , we estimate @xmath35 , the interaction of two atoms in a box of size @xmath28 via employing a more sophisticated approach , the real - space renormalization transformation ( rsrt ) which further takes into account the many - body effect on @xmath36 .",
    "this approach indicates the fermionization must not be the whole story .",
    "consider , instead of @xmath37 discussed above ,    @xmath38    which is the effective strength of the short range two - body interaction .",
    "again we divide the length scales in rsrt into two regimes that are separated by @xmath21 : the short distance regime in which two- and few - body physics dominates and the long wave length regime where the many - body collective effect dominates .",
    "@xmath21 defines the interface where the microscopic few - body parameter @xmath0 at shorter distance needs to match the macroscopic coarse grain condition .",
    "so at scales smaller than @xmath21 , we can employ the rsrt of the two - body running coupling constant @xmath39 in vacuum to monitor the effective interaction ; the finite density has very little effect in this regime i.e. @xmath40 . at larger distances , because @xmath0 defined here is subject to a thermodynamic constraint of the chemical potential at @xmath41 , the effect of condensate on @xmath0 or @xmath42 is to impose a boundary condition on the flow of @xmath43 via the coarse - grain condition in eq .",

    "was also applied in a previous study to understand bose gases near resonance  @xcite .",
    "our results differ from theirs in two aspects .",

    "second , when extrapolated to the limit of small @xmath208 , the results in ref .",
    "@xcite imply a correction of order of @xmath11 to the usual hartree - fock chemical potential but with a negative sign , opposite to the sign of lhy corrections and/or our results .",

    "@xcite are similar to the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite but differ from ours . in table",
    "i , we make further comparisons by listing the main features in different approaches .",

    "however , the lhy effect was reproduced in the numerical program in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ @xmath213 this is seen both in the diagrammatic resummation and the rg approach outlined here . note that @xmath214 is for a range of three - body parameters relevant to cold atoms . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "from a phenomenological point of view , it is quite appealing to generalize the self - consistent coarse grain relation eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) by further taking into account the three - body effective interaction @xmath203 ;    @xmath215    where @xmath216 are the renormalized two- and three - body interaction constants respectively at length scale @xmath28 and @xmath217 .",
    "if one can calculate these renormalized quantities , then one is able to obtain @xmath15 which includes the effect of @xmath203 .",
    "we have proceeded further from here using the renormalization group equations similar to what was discussed in section ii , iii ; they yield qualitatively the same results as the diagarmmatic approach below .",
    "however , when benchmarking against the dilute gas theory , the diagrammatics turn out to be numerically superior ; the diagrammatic resummation used in our previous paper reproduces @xmath218 of lee - huang - yang corrections in the dilute limit . for this reason",
    ", we are going to outline the framework of the diagrammatic calculations and briefly comment on the results .",
    "the hamiltonian for a condensate with a short range interaction is    @xmath219    here @xmath220 and the sum is over non - zero momentum states .",
    "@xmath82 is the strength of the contact interaction related to the scattering length @xmath1 via @xmath221 , @xmath58 is the volume .",
    "@xmath180 is the number density of the condensed atoms and @xmath15 is the chemical potential , both of which are functions of @xmath1 and to be determined self - consistently .    in the diagrammatic approach ,",
    "we first define the chemical potential of non - condensed particles as @xmath15 and the number density of condensed atoms is @xmath180 . the energy density can be calculated as @xmath179 ( see below )",
    ". then one should have the following set of self - consistent equations for a gas with total number density @xmath12 ,    @xmath222    where @xmath181 is the chemical potential for the condensed atoms and has to be equal to the chemical potential @xmath15 in equilibrium .",
    "we further introduce the self - energy @xmath108 of non - condensed atoms or virtual particles to facilitate the calculation of @xmath179 that now explicitly depends on @xmath223 .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ scd ] ) has to be further supplemented by    @xmath224    which can be proven in the same fashion as the pines - hugenholtz theorem @xcite .",
    "( [ scd ] ) and ( [ hp ] ) have been applied to obtain the chemical potential in 3d bose gases near resonance @xcite .",
    "calculations of @xmath179 for a given @xmath225 can be carried out diagrammatically . if we restrict ourselves to the virtual processes involving only two or three excited atoms and truncate the hilbert space accordingly , then diagrammatically we only need to collect the diagrams which contribute to the effective two- and three - body interaction constants @xmath226 .",
    "as far as the chemical potential is concerned , this truncation turns out to be highly precise in the dilute limit .",
    "the result is listed below .",
    "the mass @xmath227 is set to be one .",
    "@xmath228    where @xmath229 is a solution of the following integral equation    @xmath230.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath231 is again the one - particle green s function projected to the @xmath232-wave channel ; it is defined as    @xmath233    in the appendix , we outline the major steps in the loop summation which leads to @xmath179 .",
    "the numerical solution to these self - consistent equations was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and they are qualitatively the same as the solution to the self - consistent rge for @xmath0 and we are not going to repeat here @xcite . here",
    "we want to make a few further comments on the resummation technique .",
    "first , @xmath0 defined this way is an effective two - body interaction renormalized by condensates and includes a subset of @xmath234-body interactions defined in the vacuum . at one - loop level",
    ", it yields the most dominating contribution ; the residue effects are from the irreducible @xmath235-body interactions which contains less than one thousandth of the total contribution .",
    "second , the three - body contribution in our self - consistent approach appears to be around a few percent and numerically insignificant .",
    "since when compared to @xmath0 , the contribution from @xmath203 in the dilute limit as well as near resonance is small as shown previously @xcite , it is reasonable to conjecture that further inclusion @xmath236 would nt change our result presented here in a substantial way .",
    "the truncation of the energy density expression at @xmath203 should be accurate enough for all the practical purposes of studying bose gases near resonance .",
    "we hope these statements can be tested in precision measurements of chemical potentials as well as in future quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "third , the energy density expression in eq . ( [ gs ] ) becomes exact in the limit where only the processes involving two or three virtual atoms are allowed .",
    "effectively , this is equivalent to truncating the hilbert space and including the correlations up to the trimer channel .",
    "the rge approach is instrumental to our understanding of the emergent phenomena in quantum few- and many - body systems .",
    "the application to bose gases near resonance perhaps is another example of what a simple rge transformation can lead to .",
    "we have applied this approach to understand the nature of bose gases near resonance and found that energetically , the bose gases close to unitarity are nearly _ fermionized _ before an onset instability sets in , _",
    "i.e. _ the chemical potentials of the bose gases approach that of the fermi energy of a fermi gas with equal mass and density . beyond the instability point",
    ", the chemical potential has an imaginary part indicating strong hybridization with molecules .",
    "the model we have employed to study the bose gases near resonance is a short range _ attractive _ potential which has a range much shorter than the interatomic distance of the gases or effectively a contact potential .",
    "this is a very good approximation of real physical interactions between cold atoms . if the potential is a short range but repulsive one , then bose gases are always in the dilute limit because the scattering lengths are bounded by the range of interactions , disregarding the strength of potential . for bosons interacting with a repulsive potential but with a range comparable to the interparticle distance",
    ", we should anticipate the physics in this limit to be very similar to what happens in liquid @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "the excitation spectrum should develop roton minima that imply strong short range crystal correlations .",
    "when the range of interactions is further increased , eventually there should be a quantum transition to a crystal where all bosons are depleted from the condensate .",
    "the physics of repulsive bosons and liquid @xmath237 belong to a different universality class which fundamentally differs from what we described in this article , i.e. the properties of nearly fermionized bose gases near resonances with a contact interaction .",

    "the model hamiltonian could be written as :                      similarly , @xmath203 could be estimated by summing up all n - loop diagrams with 3 incoming and outgoing lines which are depicted in fig .",
    "we consider a general case where three incoming momenta are @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and outgoing ones are @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the scattering amplitude between theses states is then given by @xmath247 . at the tree level ,",
    "the effective 3-particle interaction is :      where @xmath249 and @xmath250 are frequencies of lines with momentum @xmath251 and @xmath252 respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath253 is the product of the perturbation factor @xmath254 , vertex factor @xmath255 and symmetry factor @xmath256 which will be explained later .    to keep the notations simple , we set @xmath139 from now on .",
    "we consider on - shell limit and substitute @xmath249 and @xmath250 by @xmath257 and @xmath258 respectively .",
    "to project into the @xmath232-wave channel , we take the average over all directions ,              where @xmath263 and @xmath264 stand for interaction terms corresponding to different types of vertices namely @xmath265 and @xmath266 . for example , for a diagram with 2 vertices of type @xmath265 and one vertex of type @xmath266",
    ", @xmath254 is the factor in front of @xmath267 term in numerator of the above equation divided by @xmath268 . in the vacuum case , where all the vertices are the same and all the lines can have non - zero momenta , @xmath254 is simply equal to @xmath269 .    _",

    ", @xmath255 , is defined as the product of the factors in front of @xmath0 for different vertices shown in hamiltonian . for vacuum case",

    "@xmath272 where @xmath268 shows the number of permutations of vertices and @xmath273 is the number of different ways of connecting vertices ( 2 for incoming lines and 2 for outgoing lines ) .                            for the calculation of @xmath203 for condensates , one has to exclude the tree level diagram that no longer exists because of momentum conservation .",
    "the sum of the rest infinite series leads to the following integral equation for the scattering amplitude @xmath286 ,      the above scattering amplitude could then be applied to calculate the scatterings between condensed atoms when setting @xmath111 , @xmath65 and @xmath137 to be zero in the above equation but with two further modifications .",
    "the first change is the numerical factor in front of the effective interactions .",
    "this factor in condensate case is @xmath288 of the factor in vacuum case , because there is a @xmath289 factor for changing the external legs of the external vertices for non - zero incoming momenta .",
    "so we will get the same integral equation , but the first term in the bracket of the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ integral2 ] ) would be substituted with @xmath290 .",
    "the second change would be in the shift of the energy .",
    "if we set the momentum of external legs to zero from the beginning , in the on - shell limit there is no shift of the energy for @xmath249 and @xmath250 in eq .",
