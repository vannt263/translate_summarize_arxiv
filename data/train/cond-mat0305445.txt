    "excitations in condensed matter systems with quenched disorder have been a subject of intense study during the last several decades .",
    "historically , it has been fermionic excitations in random systems that have received most attention .",
    "the reason for this lies in part with the rapid development of experiments and theory involving mesoscopic conductors , where the effects of disorder in phase - coherent electron systems have been studied in great detail.@xcite    it is , however , also of considerable interest to study random systems with bosonic excitations , and there is an extensive literature treating problems of this type , too .",
    "for instance , the propagation of phonons in glasses and of electromagnetic waves in media with random refractive index has long been a subject of active research,@xcite and trapping of light via scattering from disorder is a principle on which random lasers are based.@xcite other examples of bosonic excitations in random systems include vibrations of pinned elastic structures such as charge density waves,@xcite magnons in diluted antiferromagnets and spin glasses,@xcite and quasiparticles in superfluid liquid helium permeating a porous medium.@xcite to some extent , work on these problems has focussed on specific features of individual examples , and given less emphasis to a generic aspects than has been the case for disordered fermionic problems .    in this paper",
    "we emphasise just these generic aspects . in particular",
    ", we examine the relationship between universality classes identified for fermionic problems and models for bosonic excitations , as well as features that are specific to bosonic problems .",
    "in addition , we develop a framework for treating bosonic excitations which we use to calculate the density of states and localization properties of one dimensional , randomly pinned systems .",
    "some of our results have been presented in short form elsewhere.@xcite    our discussion is organised as follows . in sec.[symmetries ] we review the symmetry classes established within random matrix theory for disordered fermionic systems .",
    "we recall in sec.[bosonic ] the general form for a quadratic bosonic hamiltonian and the bogoliubov transformation required to diagonalise it , and show how it is useful to introduce an auxilliary problem with structure similar to that in the chiral symmetry class . in sec.[examples ]",
    "we discuss how various examples of systems with bosonic excitations fit into this general framework . here",
    "we emphasise the distinction between excitations that are goldstone modes and those that are not , and outline an established argument that leads in the latter case to the result @xmath3 . then ,",
    "as an illustrative example , we consider the random field @xmath4 spin chain , using our formalism as the basis for a numerical study of the discrete system , presented in sec.[discrete ] , and giving an analytical treatment of the continuum limit in sec.[continuum ] , recovering in both cases the behavior @xmath3 . in sec.[heisenberg ] we consider the random field heisenberg spin chain and some related but simpler models , which are of interest because disorder enters them in a more general way than for the @xmath4 model .",
    "finally , we summarise the relevant experimental situation in sec.[experiment ] and end with concluding remarks in sec.[concluding ]",
    "to provide a context for our discussion of bosonic systems , we begin by setting out the symmetry classes that are recognized within random matrix theory for fermionic systems.@xcite models of non - interacting quasiparticles play an important role in the study of fermionic excitations in disordered conductors , insulators and superconductors .",
    "it has long been appreciated that the properties of these models are controlled by the discrete symmetries of the single particle hamiltonians .",
    "originally three symmetry classes for random hamiltonians were identified.@xcite one class consists of random hamiltonians that have time - reversal invariance but no kramers degeneracy . in an appropriate basis",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath5 is real , so that [ wd1 ] h = h^*. random hamiltonians which obey eq .",
    "appear , for example , when studying disordered conductors without applied magnetic field .",
    "a second symmetry class consists of time - reversal invariant random hamiltonians for particles with half - integer spin and hence kramers degeneracy . in this case",
    "the time - reveral operation includes spin inversion , and invariance requires [ wd2 ] h=_2 h^ * _ 2 .",
    "( here and in the following , @xmath6 for @xmath7 or @xmath8 represent the conventional pauli matrices , acting on a subspace identified by the context . ) in order for eq .   to be different in an essential way from eq .  , spin rotation invariance must be broken .",
    "thus this case is of relevance for disordered conductors with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "a third symmetry class arises when the hamiltonian has no discrete symmetries .",
    "examples of these symmetry classes are provided by the three wigner - dyson random matrix ensembles.@xcite    more recently , it has been recognized @xcite that there are seven additional classes of disordered fermionic hamiltonians .",
    "these arise where there exists a special reference energy ( taken to be zero in the following ) for the system , and a symmetry operation which relates eigenstates in pairs .",
    "three of these seven are referred to as chiral symmatery classes.@xcite hamiltonians for these classes can be put into the form [ z1 ] h = ( ) where @xmath9 is itself a matrix or an operator .",
    "they obey the symmetry condition [ z1c ] h = - _ 3 h _ 3 .",
    "this ensures that energy levels of such hamiltonians appear in pairs @xmath10 , since if @xmath11 is an eigenfunction with energy @xmath12 , then @xmath13 is an eigenfunction with energy @xmath14 .",
    "the symmetry condition of eq .",
    ", when combined with either eq .  , or eq .  , or neither , leads altogether to three chiral symmetry classes .",
    "chiral hamiltonians appear as tight - binding models with only off - diagonal disorder@xcite and in the problem of classical diffusion in a random medium.@xcite    the remaining four symmetry classes arise in the study of disordered superconductors with pairing treated in the mean field approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a problem has the bogoliubov - de gennes structure [ z2 ] h = ( ) , where the kinetic term @xmath15 is hermitian , while the gap function @xmath16 is antisymmetric .",
    "this structure leads to another defining symmetry condition , [ z2c ] h= -_1 h^ * _ 1 . as for chiral hamiltonians , the symmetry displayed in ensures that energy levels of bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonians appear in pairs , @xmath10 .",
    "there are four symmetry classes of such hamiltonians , according to whether or not the system has time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry , making the total count ten .    a consequence of the conditions specified in eqns .   and is that statistical properties of energy levels and , in spatially extended systems , the associated eigenfunctions , are quite different in these additional symmetry classes near zero energy , compared to properties far from zero energy , or in the wigner - dyson symmetry",
    "classes.@xcite    it is natural to ask whether this classification can be extended to problems involving non - interacting bosonic excitations or , equivalently , classical normal modes . at first sight",
    ", it might seem that quasiparticle statistics are unimportant in a non - interacting system",
    ". in one crucial respect , however , this is untrue , since stability of a system requires bosonic excitation energies to be positive , while for fermionic excitations stability is guaranteed by the pauli exclusion principle , whatever the single - particle energy levels .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "first , energy zero emerges as a special point in the spectrum of bosonic systems , as it does for the additional fermionic symmetry classes discussed above . and",
    "second , one anticipates that matrix elements of bosonic hamiltonians for random systems will have specific correlations , which ensure positivity of the spectrum .",
    "thus , while the most general form for a quadratic bosonic hamiltonian ( see below ) is superficially similar to the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian , and while normal mode frequencies , like the eigenvalues of eq .  , appear in pairs @xmath17 , matrix elements must satisfy constraints in order that frequencies are real .",
    "such a requirement is in stark contrast with the assumptions of statistical independence used in the construction of random matrix ensembles for fermionic systems . to stress the significance of this point , imagine a treatment of a disordered , interacting system which proceeds in two stages , by first finding the ground state and then calculating excitation energies within a harmonic approximation .",
    "the spirit of random matrix theory for fermionic systems is to divorce these two stages and approach the second one phenomenologically , choosing statistically independent matrix elements .",
    "by contrast , for bosonic systems it is clear that the two stages can not be completely separated .",
    "indeed , whereas for random matrix theory universal spectral properties follow largely from symmetry and are independent of the details of the matrix element distribution , we argue here that for bosonic excitations which are not goldsone modes it is the requirements of stability and the ensuing correlations in the hamiltonian for excitations that give rise to universal spectral properties .",
    "in this section we discuss the most general form for bosonic hamiltonians and summarise the diagonalisation procedure , following standard lines ( see , for example , ref . ) .",
    "we also emphasise the distinction between oscillator frequencies and stiffnesses .",
    "finally , we show for oscillations about a stable ground state that it is natural to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of a chiral matrix .",
    "the most general bosonic hamiltonian can be written in the equivalent forms @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & \\oh \\left ( \\matrix { { \\bf p } & { \\bf q } } \\right ) \\left ( \\matrix { m & c \\cr c^t & k } \\right ) \\left ( \\matrix{{\\bf p } \\cr { \\bf q } } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & \\oh \\left ( \\matrix{{\\bf a^\\dagger } & { \\bf a } } \\right ) \\left ( \\matrix { \\gamma & \\delta \\cr \\delta^\\dagger & \\gamma^t } \\right ) \\left ( \\matrix { { \\bf a } \\cr { \\bf a^\\dagger } } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the coordinates and momenta of the oscillators , and @xmath21 are bosonic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 are real and symmetric , while @xmath24 is an arbitrary real matrix .",
    "equivalently , @xmath25 is hermitian , while @xmath16 is symmetric .",
    "physically , @xmath22 is the inverse mass matrix of the oscillators , @xmath23 is the matrix of spring constants , and couplings of the type represented by @xmath24 occur , for example , in spin systems .",
    "it is convenient to define the @xmath26 symmetric matrix = ( ) .",
    "we are interested in frequencies of oscillators decribed by eq .  .",
    "from hamilton s equations of motion it follows that these frequencies are eigenvalues of the non - hermitian matrix [ freq1 ]  = ( ) _ 2 , they are real if the system is stable , in which case @xmath5 is bounded from below , the eigenvalues of @xmath27 are positive , and we can write @xmath28 with @xmath9 real . in thse terms , to find frequencies we need to diagonalize the matrix @xmath29 , but its eigenvalues coincide with those of another matrix @xmath30 which is explicitly hermitian and , moreover , antisymmetric , so that frequencies come in pairs @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .    if @xmath33 is interpreted as a random hamiltonian , then according to the classification scheme discussed in sec .",
    "[ symmetries ] it belongs to one of the bogoliubov - de gennes classes ( more precisely , to class d , see ref .  ) .",
    "while this is indeed an indication that random oscillators behave in many ways like random fermionic hamiltonians from one of the additional symmetry classes ( having frequencies in pairs , with @xmath34 as a special point in the spectrum ) , the identification of @xmath33 as class d operator is not by itself necessarily helpful since @xmath33 does not have statistically independent matrix elements , but rather is constrained to have the form given in .",
    "instead , we shall see that a link to matrices wih chiral symmetry proves more useful .",
    "the computation of oscillator frequencies can equivalently be described as a bogoliubov transformation for coordinates and momenta , specified by real matrices @xmath35 which obey @xmath36 and tranform @xmath27 to @xmath37 . diagonalizing @xmath27",
    "using this transformation , the hamiltonian @xmath5 of eq .   takes the form @xmath38    in addition to the frequencies , obtained as eigenvalues of @xmath33 or by bogoliubov transformation of @xmath27 , the eigenvalues of @xmath27 also have physical significance , for example as inverse static susceptibilities .",
    "we refer to them as _ stiffnesses _ , denoting them by @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "in general , there is no simple relationship between stiffnesses and frequencies , but several special cases provide important exceptions , as follows .",
    "consider first @xmath27 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , representing oscillations of particles , all with unit mass , connected by springs with spring constants @xmath43 . in this example , half of all the stiffnesses are equal to @xmath44 , while the other half are the eigenvalues @xmath39 of the matrix @xmath23 ; the frequencies and stiffnesses are related by [ squarerelation ] _",
    "a second special case arises for magnon excitations in weakly disordered ferromagnets , which have a hamiltonian of the form of eq .   with @xmath45 and @xmath41 .",
    "in that case , the stiffnesses are the eigenvalues of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and come in identical pairs .",
    "the frequencies are simply @xmath46 a final and important special case occurs when one stiffness , say @xmath47 , is much smaller than all others . in this regime ,",
    "an approximate relation exists between the smallest frequency and the smallest stiffness : @xmath48    to derive this relation , a more detailed analysis of the structure of @xmath27 and @xmath33 is required . since @xmath27 is a real symmetric matrix with positive eigenvalues , it can in general be represented as = u ^2 u^t where @xmath49 is an orthogonal matrix and @xmath50 is the diagonal matrix whose eigenvalues are square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding matrix @xmath33 can be written as @xmath51 introducing an antisymmetric matrix @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 suppose initially that one of the stiffnesses vanishes , so that @xmath54 . then at least one frequency must vanish as well , since @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , because @xmath33 is antisymmetric and its frequencies come in opposite pairs , two frequencies are zero .",
    "the mathematical mechanism for this is clear from eq .  .",
    "first , since @xmath56 for all @xmath57 , one of the eigenvalues of @xmath33 is @xmath58 , with an eigenvector @xmath59 .",
    "second , all other eigenvalues can be found by diagonalizing a smaller matrix , @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "but @xmath62 is an odd - dimensional antisymmetric matrix , and therefore has at least one zero eigenvalue , @xmath63 , with an associated normalised eigenvector which we write as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "now treat small non - zero @xmath66 using perturbation theory about this limit , with @xmath67 .",
    "the change in @xmath33 is _",
    "ij = ( _ 1 i a_ij _ j + _ i a_ij _ 1j ) ( 1-_1i_1j ) . under this perturbation ,",
    "the doubly degenerate eigenvalue @xmath34 of @xmath33 splits into @xmath68 , determined by diagonalizing the @xmath69 matrix @xmath70 hence @xmath71 barring an accidental vanishing of the matrix element @xmath72 .",
    "the usefulness of this result lies in the following .",
    "consider a random system with bosonic excitations that are localized with a finite localization length at low frequency , and let the density of stiffnesses be @xmath73 .",
    "we expect that each localization volume can be treated as an independent system , and that each low frequency excitation will have a frequency much smaller than that of other excitations in its own localization volume , and will therefore be associated with a single small stiffness . applying eq .  , the density of excitation frequencies @xmath74 for small @xmath75 is [ ffr ] ( ) = d(^2 ) .",
    "one interesting check of these conclusions is provided by random matrix theory .",
    "consider an ensemble of real random matrices @xmath9 , with size @xmath76 and probability distribution @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the typical magnitude of the eigenvalue of @xmath78 closest to zero .",
    "for @xmath27 generated in this way , one finds @xmath79 at both @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "computing the eigenvalue density of @xmath82 using superintegrals , one finds that@xcite @xmath74 is independent of @xmath75 for @xmath83 , while @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "it is clear that in the regime @xmath83 , is indeed applicable , while in the opposite regime it breaks down .      to study stiffnesses of bosonic oscillators with @xmath28 , it is advantageous to introduce @xmath86 , an auxiliary matrix in which @xmath9 and @xmath87 enter linearly .",
    "[ chi ] = ( ) . obviously , the eigenvalues @xmath88 of @xmath86 are square roots of the stiffnesses @xmath39 of @xmath27 , and the matrix @xmath86 plays the role of the square root of the original bosonic hamiltonian @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "the off - diagonal structure of @xmath86 is the defining feature of the chiral symmetry class , discussed in sec .",
    "[ symmetries ] . while the direct implications of this connection are limited , because the elements of @xmath9 are not independent random variables as would be the case in a random matrix ensemble , techniques originally developed for systems in this symmetry class will prove useful in our treatment of one - dimensional systems , as we describe in sec .",
    "[ discrete ] and sec .",
    "[ continuum ] .",
    "to study the frequencies of the oscillators , as opposed to their stiffnesses , a second auxiliary matrix @xmath89 is helpful .",
    "we shall call matrices with this structure _ chiral bosonic matrices_. the eigenvalue equation for @xmath90 can be written in the form ( ) = ( )  , which of course inherits its structure from hamilton s equations .",
    "the main difficulty in making use of these ideas is that , in practice , only @xmath27 is known initially and a method must be developed to find @xmath9 . moreover , @xmath9 is defined only up to a left multiplication by an arbitrary orthogonal matrix . for the introduction of @xmath9 to be helpful , it will be important that it can be chosen to have a simple form , with , for example , only short range couplings .",
    "we shall show that this is indeed possible for a variety of problems .",
    "it is a feature of models for disordered fermionic systems from the chiral and bogoliubov - de gennes symmetry classes that their characteristic behavior appears only close to the reference energy , identified by the discrete symmetry of the hamiltonian , while spectral properties at energies far from this are indistinguishable from those of the wigner - dyson classes . in a similar way , for bosonic excitations in disordered systems we expect it to be properties at low frequency that that are of particular interest .",
    "examples of such excitations can be divided into two categories , according to whether or not they are goldstone modes , associated with a broken continuous symmetry . in this section we summarize for each of these categories some of the previously established results .",
    "we also illustrate the introduction of a chiral hamiltonian @xmath86 for a one - dimensional phonon model .",
    "important instances of goldstone modes in disordered systems include acoustic phonons in glasses and alloys,@xcite and spin waves in isotropic , dilute ferromagnets and antiferromagnets , and isotropic spin glasses.@xcite in disorder - free versions of these systems , low frequency excitations have long wavelength and are described by equations of motion that involve macroscopic properties of the system : density , elastic constants , magnetic susceptibility and spin stiffness .",
    "disorder introduces local fluctuations in the values of these quantities , but one expects excitations to couple only to fluctuations averaged over a volume with linear dimensions set by a wavelength . because of this , randomness only weakly affects low - frequency goldstone modes , especially in higher dimensions for which the averaging is most effective .",
    "such averaging is demonstrated by the low - frequency behavior of the excitation density @xmath74 , which above a critical dimension @xmath0 varies with the same power of @xmath75 as in the disorder - free system .",
    "it is also shown by localization properties of excitations : in one and two - dimensional systems , the localization length @xmath91 diverges as @xmath75 approaches zero , while in higher - dimensional systems , all low - frequency states are extended . in this subsection",
    "we review the behavior of @xmath74 and @xmath91 for phonons in alloys and for spin waves in diluted antiferromagnets and spin glasses , considering the effect of weak disorder included in the relevant equation of motion .",
    "we also use the hamiltonian for phonons in a one - dimensional disordered system as an illustration of the general mapping to chiral models , introduced in sec .",
    "[ chiral - symmetry ] .    consider first a scalar version of a model for acoustic phonons , in which a mode with frequency @xmath75 has coordinate @xmath92 satisfying [ phonons ] ^2 q(*r * ) = - c^2 ^2 q(*r * ) .",
    "suppose that the speed of sound , @xmath93 has random fluctuations in space , about an average value @xmath94 , with only short - range correlations .",
    "work on this and related problems is reviewed in ref .  , and",
    "an early treatment of localization in this context was given in ref .  .",
    "the essentials for our purposes are as follows .",
    "first , the fluctuations in @xmath93 , averaged over a @xmath95-dimensional volume of size set by the wavelength in the disorder - free system , decrease compared to @xmath94 with decreasing frequency as @xmath96 .",
    "thus in this case the critical dimension is @xmath2 , and for any @xmath97 the excitation density approaches the form found without disorder at low frequency .",
    "moreover , from a calculation using the born approximation , the rayleigh scattering rate @xmath98 varies as @xmath99 .",
    "( this dependence combines a factor of @xmath100 from the frequency - dependence of coupling to disorder , and a factor of @xmath101 from the density of final states for scattering processes ) . in one dimension",
    ", disorder localizes with a localization length proportional to the mean free path , which here is @xmath102 , and so@xcite ( ) ^-2 . in two dimensions it is a familiar feature of electronic systems that the localization length is exponentially large in @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 is the fermi wavevector and @xmath105 is the mean free path ) : the equivalent parameter for the phonon problem is @xmath106 , so that@xcite ( ) ( [ _ 0/]^2 ) , where @xmath107 is a disorder - strength dependent constant .",
    "these results contrast interestingly with those for an antiferromagnet which has randomness generated either by site dilution ( taken small enough that the system is above the percolation threshold ) or by substitution of impurity spins with a magnetic moment different from that of the host spins.@xcite in a discussion of the random antiferromagnet , it is useful to begin from the dispersion relation for spin waves in a two - sublattice _ ferrimagnet _ without disorder . at small wavevector @xmath108 , this has the form [ ferrimagnet ] ^2 + ( m_a - m_b)= c^2 k^2 , where @xmath109 is proportional to the difference between the two sublattice magnetic moments , which are taken to be oppositely aligned . setting @xmath110 , one recovers the usual dispersion relation in an antiferromagnet , with spin - wave speed @xmath93 . for the random antiferromagnet ,",
    "independent disorder on the two sublattices generates random fluctuations in the local value of @xmath111 about a mean value of zero .",
    "averaging these fluctuations over a volume of size set by the wavelength in the undiluted system gives a random variable with an amplitude that scales as @xmath96 . because of this",
    ", disorder appears in via the term @xmath112 , which scales as @xmath113 . above the critical dimension @xmath1 ,",
    "disorder is irrelevant in the sense that this term may be be neglected for small @xmath75 compared to @xmath100 .",
    "the value of the critical dimension is also apparent from a born approximation calculation of the rate for scattering of spin waves by disorder,@xcite which yields @xmath114 . because of this",

    "this implies [ rho ] ( ) ^-1/3 and [ xi ] ( ) ^-2/3 .",
    "we expect all these results for low - frequency behavior to be characteristic not only of disordered antiferromagnets , but also of spin glasses , since the two systems have in common the crucial feature of a magnetization density that is locally non - zero and random , but has zero average .",
    "a detailed treatment of excitations in spin glasses , however , is much more difficult than in weakly disordered antiferromagnets , because for spin glasses the ground state is generally disorder - dependent and unknown . instead , the established approach is a hydrodynamic one,@xcite which leads to linearly dispersing modes with a speed determined by the macroscopic spin - stiffness and susceptibility . in the light of our discussion ,",
    "we expect these hydrodynamic results to be correct for @xmath97 . by contrast , for one - dimensional systems , microscopic calculations are possible since frustration is absent and ground states can be determined .",
    "results from computations@xcite in one - dimensional models of @xmath74 and @xmath91 coincide with eqns .   and , above .",

    "we have not been able to make contact between this result and the approaches described here .    as a next step , it is interesting to return to acoustic phonons in disordered systems and use the one - dimensional version of this problem to illustrate some of the methods set out in sec .",

    ", this evolution is as follows .",
    "if fluctuations in @xmath316 are omitted , @xmath368 and @xmath369 have stable fixed points at which both their eigenvalues are small in @xmath129 and @xmath75 respectively . in both cases , the stable fixed point has a basin of attraction with a boundary that is reached when an eigenvalue of @xmath368 or @xmath369 is large and positive ( @xmath371 or @xmath372 respectively ) . restoring fluctuations in @xmath316 , with increasing @xmath130 we find ( partly on the basis of simulations , not presented here ) that @xmath368 or @xmath369 fluctuates in the vicinity of its fixed point for intervals that are long if @xmath129 or @xmath75 are small .",
    "each such interval ends when fluctuations take the matrix to the boundary of the basin of attraction .",
    "one eigenvalue of @xmath368 or @xmath369 then runs off to positive infinity , reappears from negative infinity and returns to the vicinity of the fixed point .",

    "we consider separately the regions close to the fixed points , which are different for @xmath368 and @xmath369 , and the region far from the fixed points , which is essentially the same in both cases .",
    "it is useful to introduce an explicit coordinate system .",
    "we write @xmath376 where @xmath377 , @xmath378 and @xmath379 are random with mean zero , and @xmath380 is taken proportional to the unit matrix , with a proportionality constant that can be changed by a rescaling of the length coordinate @xmath130 .",
    "we also set @xmath381    for calculation of stiffnesses using this coordinate system , one has @xmath382 and becomes = 2 s z_1 -z_1 + _ 0 z_1 + _ 1 s , = 2 s z_3 - z_3 + _ 0 z_3 + _ 3 s , = ( s^2 + z_1 ^ 2 + z_3 ^ 2 ) + - s + _ 0 s + _ 1 z_1 + _ 3 z_3 .",

    "the size of this region , and therefore the probability density within it , follows in each case from our discussion of the fixed points and their neighborhoods .",
    "characterizing @xmath198 by the value of its trace , and combining the fixed - point coordinates with the rescalings used to arrive at , the value of @xmath401 in this region is @xmath402 in the first instance and @xmath403 in the second . from this",

    "the practical determination of the chiral potential , however , remains an open problem in this case .",
    "the range of physical systems to which the ideas we have set out may apply is potentially very wide .",
    "the essential requirements are : quenched disorder ; a ground state that can be considered classically ; and excitations that can be treated as weakly interacting normal modes .",
    "these requirements may be met for vibrational modes , either in glasses , or in randomly pinned phases with broken translational symmetry such as charge density wave states .",
    "they may also be satisfied for magnetic excitations in disordered ferromagnets or antiferromagnets , or in spin glasses , either with or without significant magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the most specific feature for which one would like experimental evidence is probably the frequency dependence @xmath3 of the density for excitations that are not goldstone modes .",
    "alternatively , for excitations that _ are _ goldstone modes , interest focusses on the frequency dependence of the mean free path at small @xmath75 , or , in the case of heisenberg antiferromagnets and spin glasses which are quasi one - dimensional , the low - frequency form of the density of states .    before summarising the experimental situation , it is useful to outline ways in which excitations in a disordered system may fall outside the framework we have used .",
    "large quantum fluctuations are the obvious route to different physics , and may be important in at least two ways .",
    "first , it can happen that a ground state is very far from being a classical configuration dressed with small zero - point fluctuations : random singlet phases @xcite in disordered quantum spin chains constitute a well - studied example .",
    "second , it may be that even low - lying quantized excitations are unlike weakly interacting bosonic modes . to have a concrete example , consider the single mode problem for an anharmonic oscillator with potential @xmath142 , as reviewed in sec.[bosonic - non - goldstone ] . typically , this potential energy will have local minima separated by barriers from the absolute minimum , and the importance of quantum motion through or over the barrier will depend on the size of the mass @xmath140 appearing in eq .. thus , for a given @xmath142 , in the semi - classical limit the low - lying quantum states will be close to harmonic oscillator levels with the classical normal mode frequency , while if quantum fluctuations are large , tunneling through barriers may hybridise levels associated with different classical minima , generating two - level systems , or the low - lying levels may be determined by the form of @xmath142 in regions too far from its absolute minimum for the classical normal mode frequency to be relevant . in the ensemble , this crossover takes place as a function of frequency , as discussed in ref .. as a result , one expects harmonic excitations with a density @xmath3 at higher frequencies , and two - level systems with a constant density at lower frequencies .    turning to experiments , somewhat surprisingly , the best evidence that we are aware of for an excitation density with an @xmath421 dependence is from studies of vibrational excitations in glasses . here , inelastic neutron scattering and other measurements @xcite indicate an excess density of harmonic modes , compared to what is expected from debye theory and the measured speed of sound .",
    "analysis of the temperature dependence of the heat capacity @xcite separates two contributions that are additional to the debye value .",
    "one is approximately linear in temperature @xmath422 , dominates at low @xmath422 , and is attributed to two - level systems .",
    "the other varies as @xmath423 , dominates at higher @xmath422 , and is attributed to harmonic modes with the stated frequency dependence for their density . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "such excitations differ in an important way from the one we have discussed , because they coexist with propagating phonon modes .",
    "the consequences of coupling between the two sets of modes remain to be investigated , although coupling between localised _",
    "vibrational modes and phonons has been studied in ref .  .",
    "a context in which localised vibrational modes are expected without any coexisting propagating phonons is provided by pinned charge density waves , represented in one dimension by the model studied in sec.[continuum ] .",
    "indeed , it was in this framework that aleiner and ruzin @xcite and fogler @xcite argued for a density of harmonic proportional to @xmath421 , with a crossover at low frequency @xcite to a constant density of two - level systems .",
    "as reviewed by fogler @xcite , existing measurements of frequency - dependent conductivity @xcite do not show the response expected from such harmonic modes , possibly because the low - temperature limit is not accessed .",
    "studies of spin waves in disordered magnetic systems present opportunities to examine both goldstone and non - goldstone modes . in particular , inelastic neutron scattering measurements of spin dynamics in a dilute near - heisenberg antiferromagnet @xcite show the expected broadening in wavevector of excitations with increasing frequency .",
    "in contrast , magnetic neutron scattering measurements on amorphous magnetic alloys in which there is local magnetic anisotropy @xcite find modes which are broad in wavevector at all frequencies . in this case",
    "the density of excitations is approximately constant in frequency over the measured range . from our results ,",
    "we expect a decrease in this density at low frequency , and a more detailed examination of low - frequency behavior would be of considerable interest .",
    "since we have investigated a variety of different directions in this paper , it is perhaps useful to close with a short summary of our main points .    considering the general quadratic hamiltonian for bosonic excitations , ,",
    "we have noted a formal similarity between it and fermionic random matrix hamiltonians from the additional symmetry classes ( e.g. ) . we have argued that this has limited direct consequences , because stability of the ground state requires correlations between matrix elements of the bosonic hamiltonian which invalidate a random matrix approach .",
    "instead we have shown that there is a useful mapping to an auxiliary problem with the structure of the chiral symmetry class , which we have set out explicitly for a range of models .",
    "examples of bosonic excitations in disordered media separate into those that are goldstone modes , and those that are not . for the former ,",
    "we have reviewed established results , which demonstrate that low frequency excitations decouple from disorder except for some systems in and below a marginal dimension @xmath1 . for excitations that are not goldstone modes , we have underlined the way in which disorder itself generates low frequency excitations , and the universal form expected for their density , @xmath3 . taking as an example the one - dimensional @xmath4 model in a random field , we have used our techniques in detailed analytical and numerical calculations , obtaining results that illustrate this behavior of @xmath74 .",
    "a further application of the techniques we have developed here is to mattis models .",
    "these model spin glasses lack frustration , and their statistical mechanical properties are equivalent under a gauge transformation to those of ferromagnets .",
    "they have a ground state spin configurations which are known for each disorder configuration , but excitations are nevertheless affected in a non - trivial way by disorder.@xcite because the ground state is known explicitly , the magnons in mattis glasses are much easier to study than in a real spin glass .",
    "being goldstone modes , these magnons fall into the same category as those in weakly disordered antiferromagnets , discussed in this paper . in particular , their critical dimension is @xmath1 . in future work @xcite by one of the present authors and a. altland",
