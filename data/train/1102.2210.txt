    "cavity optomechanics has recently emerged as a rapidly developing research field in which relevant tasks such as quantum limited displacement sensing , highly sensitive force measurements , and the realization of quantum interfaces for quantum information networks , may be realized by virtue of the radiation pressure coupling between the light confined in a cavity and nano- and micro - mechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "the standard and simplest optomechanical setup is a fabry - perot cavity in which one of the two mirrors is a vibrating micromechanical object .",
    "it has been the first setup experimentally studied @xcite , and for which ground state cooling of the resonator has been recently approached @xcite , and strong optomechanical coupling has been demonstrated @xcite . in order to enter in a regime where the dynamics is distinctly quantum , the optomechanical coupling has to dominate both optical and mechanical losses , which implies a high - finesse optical cavity enabling to amplify the radiation pressure , and a movable mirror with high mechanical quality factor @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is technically non - trivial to fabricate devices possessing simultaneously high @xmath0 and high reflectivity , and therefore novel devices have been recently designed and tested .",
    "a first example is provided by silica toroidal optical microresonators , coupled by the radiation pressure of the circulating light with the radial vibrational modes of the support @xcite .",
    "other novel approaches propose to avoid completely clamping mechanical losses by optically trapping levitating dielectrics as in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other optomechanical devices have been tested , in which the coupling is provided by the transverse gradient force , such as suspended silicon photonic waveguides @xcite , sin nanowire evanescently coupled to a microtoroidal resonator @xcite , and a `` zipper '' cavity formed by two adjacent photonic crystal wires @xcite .",
    "a further solution has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the mechanical degree of freedom is represented by a partially reflective thin vibrating membrane inserted within a standard cavity with two bulk mirrors .",
    "a high value of @xmath0 is reached by using commercially available high - stress sin membranes , which are known to possess very low intrinsic losses @xcite . at the same time",
    "one has a high - finesse cavity by using standard highly reflective mirrors and minimizing optical absorption in the membrane , which can be achieved using stoichiometric sin @xcite and very thin membranes . as recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this `` membrane - in - the - middle '' setup has the further advantage that the radiation pressure coupling can be tuned _ in situ _ by adjusting the position and orientation of the membrane within the cavity @xcite .",
    "in particular optomechanical couplings which are nonlinear in the resonator position can be engineered and tuned . in this paper",
    "we study this cavity - membrane system by investigating to which extent optical absorption by the membrane affects reaching the quantum regime .",
    "we shall see that even if absorption appreciably decreases the cavity finesse and also heats the membrane , it is still possible to find realistic parameter settings where quantum behavior of the cavity - membrane system is detectable , even up to room temperature .    in sec .",
    "ii we describe the system by means of quantum langevin equations , showing in particular how the dynamics is modified by optical absorption by the membrane . in sec .",
    "iii we focus on the quantum behavior of the optomechanical system , and show that ground state cooling of the mechanical resonator , and steady - state optomechanical entanglement are achievable even for a non - negligible absorption . sec .",

    "the membrane vibrational modes are coupled to the optical cavity modes by radiation pressure , and therefore one has in general a multimode bosonic system in which mechanical and optical modes interact in a nonlinear way . however , in most practical situations , one can adopt a simplified description based on a _ single _ cavity mode interacting with a _ single _ mechanical mode  @xcite .",
    "one can restrict to a single cavity mode whenever the driving laser populates a given cavity mode only ( typically a tem@xmath2 mode , here associated with the annihilation operator @xmath3 ) , and if scattering from the driven mode to other modes is negligible .",
