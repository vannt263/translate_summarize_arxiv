    "bloch oscillations ( bos ) represent a fundamental coherent transport phenomenon originally predicted for quantum particles in periodic potentials driven by an external dc force .",
    "bos have been observed in a wide variety of quantum and classical physical systems , including semiconductor superlattices @xcite , ultracold atoms @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , arrays of evanescently - coupled optical waveguides @xcite , photonic superlattices @xcite , and acoustical superlattices @xcite . in the absence of dephasing and scattering processes and for a negligible zener tunneling ,",
    "the particle accelerated by the external force undergoes an oscillatory ( rather than a translational ) motion owing to bragg scattering off the lattice .",
    "the periodicity of the motion is basically ascribed to the transition of the energy spectrum from a continuous band with delocalized bloch eigenstates in absence of the external force , to a discrete ladder spectrum with localized wannier - stark ( ws ) eigenstates when the external force is applied and zener tunneling is negligible .",
    "a single - band tight - binding lattice in one spatial dimension provides the simplest model to describe the onset of bos and the formation of ws localized states @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of lattice disorder , nonlinearities , inhomogeneities or defects has generally a detrimental effect on bos .",
    "several authors have investigated the onset of bos in generalized tight - binging lattice models . among others ,",
    "we mention bos in nonlinear lattices @xcite and in aperiodic lattices with long - range correlated disorder @xcite , bos with spatially - inhomogeneous dc fields @xcite , bos in quasicrystals @xcite , bos for interacting bosons @xcite , bos in disordered lattices with interparticle interaction @xcite , and bos in lattices with inhomogeneous intersite couplings @xcite . the introduction of localized or extend defects in the lattice , for either the intersite couplings or the site energies , is generally expected to destroy the ws ladder spectrum of the defect - free lattice , and thus the onset of bos . in this work it is shown that localized and extended defects in the lattice can be engineered to be transparent for bos .",
    "such lattices are synthesized starting from the defect - free lattice hamiltonian by application of the technique of intertwining operators , successfully employed in supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite to add or delete energy states of a given hamiltonian . in our case ,",
    "the spectrum of the synthesized lattices differ from the wannier - stark ladder of the defect - free lattice because of the missing of pairs of resonances in the ladder , which ensures the persistence of bos and self - imaging of a wave packet .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , the technique of intertwining operators for spectral engineering of tight - binding hamiltonians",

    "the intersite coupling @xmath3 is independent of @xmath2 ( @xmath9 ) and the site energy @xmath6 increases linearly with @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the potential gradient .",
    "the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian will be denoted in the following by @xmath12 and referred to as the ws hamiltonian . as is well known",

    "our goal is to synthesize a lattice hamiltonian , of the form given by eq.(1 ) , with an energy spectrum which differs from that of the ws hamiltonian @xmath12 because of the missing of some resonances in the ws ladder spectrum .",
    "this spectral engineering problem can be solved by the technique of intertwining operators generally employed in supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , which is also valid for matrix hamiltonians ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "it can be readily shown that , provided that @xmath29 does not vanish , the following factorization for @xmath15 holds @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 let us then construct the new hamiltonian @xmath33 obtained from @xmath15 by interchanging the operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e. let us set @xmath36 using eqs.(4 - 9 ) , from e.(10 ) it can be readily shown that @xmath33 describes the hamiltonian of a tight - binding lattice [ i.e. , it is of the form ( 1 ) ] with hopping amplitudes and site energies @xmath37 given by @xmath38 an interesting property of the new hamiltonian @xmath33 is that its energy spectrum is the same as that of @xmath15 , apart from the lack of the discrete energy level @xmath39 .",

    "<S> the energy spectrum of the synthesized lattices differs from the wannier - stark ladder of the defect - free lattice because of the missing of pairs of resonances in the ladder , thus ensuring the persistence of bos . </S>"
