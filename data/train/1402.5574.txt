    "environment - fluctuation - induced effects are ubiquitous in physics , since a realistic system is inevitably coupled to an environment with very large degrees of freedom .",
    "one important effect induced by the fluctuation of the electromagnetic field ( emf ) is the casimir effect , which was predicted by casimir  @xcite that there exists an attractive force between two neutral , parallel and perfectly conducting plates placed a few micrometers apart in vacuum .",
    "this attractive force between two plates has been verified by numerous experiments  @xcite . in 1956 ,",
    "lifshitz  @xcite generalized the casimir effect induced by the quantum vacuum fluctuation to the case the attractive force between two dielectric plates induced by the thermal fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "about ten years later , boyer  @xcite first discovered that the casimir force could be repulsive for a conducting spherical shell .",
    "this set off a torrent of theoretical explorations  @xcite on the geometric shape dependence of the casimir force .",
    "the casimir force has been extensively applied in physics  @xcite , especially in atomic physics . in 1948 ,",
    "casimir and polder  @xcite calculated the attractive force between two neutral polarizable atoms ( and the force between a neutral atom and a perfectly conducting wall ) in vacuum called casimir - polder ( cp ) force , which gives a significant correction of the van der waals - london force  @xcite for the large atomic separation case .",
    "in most of the previous literatures  @xcite , researches were focused on the force induced by emf fluctuation .",
    "recently , tanaka _",
    "et al_.  @xcite generalized to the case , where the attractive force between two neutral impurity atoms results from the exchange of virtual electrons , called electronic casimir - polder ( ecp ) force .    in this paper , we study a realistic solid system composed of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanowire and two separate impurity atoms .",
    "different from the free - electron gas , the electron traveling in the nanowire described by the tight - binding model has a cosine nonlinear dispersion relation , which will present much more rich physics of interest . due to the finite energy - band width ,",
    "the results without divergence are obtain .",
    "the ecp force decreases exponentially when the distance between the two charges increases .",
    "the decay rate of the ecp force is larger for smaller hopping strength of the nanowire and it increases with the absolute value of the detuning between the atom energy and the site energy of the nanowire . for a fixed impurity - impurity distance ,",
    "the ecp force is larger for bigger hopping strength and it decreases with the absolute value of the detuning . in the low - energy regime",
    ", the cosine dispersion relation can be approximately expanded as a linear quadratic one .",
    "when the energy of the impurities is close to the edge of the energy band , we obtain the similar results as presented in ref .",

    "comparing to the conventional cp effect , the two impurity atoms play the role of the neutral atoms and the non - excitated nanowire behaves as the emf with continuous modes . due to the finite width of the energy band of the nanowire",
