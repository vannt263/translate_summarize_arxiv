    "spatiotemporal patterns have been of great interest in a variety of biological , chemical , and physical contexts @xcite . from the viewpoint of dynamics of pattern formation",
    ", these patterns can be classified as three types according to the instability mechanisms : i ) periodic in space but stationary in time , ii ) oscillatory in time but uniform in space ( in some cases , which often gives rise to phase waves due to the couple of the phases of the oscillators ) , iii ) periodic in space and oscillatory in time . based on linear stability analysis of a homogeneous state",
    ", these instabilities correspond to turing , hopf , and wave bifurcation , respectively .",
    "recently , the interactions between these instabilities , which often give rise to novel phenomena of pattern formation , have attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "yang @xmath0 @xmath1 studied the interactions between the turing and wave instabilities and observed the coexistence of turing spots and antispirals @xcite .",
    "interaction of two turing modes leads to the formation of `` black - eyes '' pattern and the superposition patterns combining stripes and/or spots @xcite .",
    "of particular interests are the interaction between the periodic turing mode and the oscillatory hopf mode @xcite .",
    "it has been explored in a brusselator model@xcite , in a semiconductor model @xcite , and in a lengyel - epstein model @xcite .",
    "the competition of the two modes near codimension - two turing - hopf bifurcations gives rise to the oscillatory turing patterns , the stable squares , and the bistability between homogeneous oscillatory states and hexagonal turing patterns .",
    "time - delayed - feedback is a practical method for controlling the dynamics of a system @xcite .",
    "it is based on applying feedback perturbation proportional to the deviation of the current state from the delayed state of the system .",
    "it was originally presented by ott @xmath0 @xmath1 to control the chaotic behavior of a deterministic system @xcite .",
    "recently , time - delayed - feedback has been used to control the pattern formations in spatially extended systems . the time delay with different feedback forms",
    "affects the behaviors of pattern formations much @xcite .",
    "it can stabilize the rigid rotation of a spiral or completely destroy a spiral @xcite .",
    "the tip trajectories of spirals can be controlled by applying time - delayed - feedback @xcite . the spontaneous suppression of spiral turbulence by using feedback has been studied experimentally in a light - sensitive belousov - zhabotinsky reaction and numerically in a modified fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite . based on a brusselator reaction - diffusion model ,",
    "li @xmath0 @xmath1 studied the effect of time delay on various pattern formations , such as the traveling and standing patterns , the inward and outward spiral waves @xcite .",
    "just recently , sen @xmath0 @xmath1 studied the transition between the turing and hopf instabilities in a reaction - diffusion model , in which the time delay is incorporated in the kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "however , from the viewpoint of experimental realization , it is not always applicable to introduce the time - delayed - feedback into the reaction terms directly . in most of the experimental cases ,",
    "the time delay acts as an additional feedback and is expressed as additional terms in the reaction - diffusion models @xcite .",
    "this can be found for example in semiconductor devices @xcite , nonlinear optical system consisting of a sodium vapor cell and a single feedback mirror @xcite , and light - sensitive belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite .",
    "so , how about the competition between turing and hopf instabilities under time delay in a realistic system ? in this paper , we study the role of time delay played on controlling the competition between the turing and hopf modes in a model which is originally derived for charge transport in a layered semiconductor system @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the determination of feedback intensities on the oscillation frequency , the intrinsic wave vector , and the intensities of the modes .",
    "results show that time delay with different forms of feedbacks changes the dynamical characteristics near the codimension - two turing - hopf bifurcations . either individual or both feedbacks can realize the transformation between the turing and hopf patterns .",
    "the corresponding numerical simulations are also done in two dimensions .",
    "in this work , we study the following two - component reaction - diffusion model : @xmath2 here the time delay is applied with the forms : @xmath3 this dimensionless model is derived from the charge transport in a layered semiconductor system @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath4 represents the voltage across the heterostructure and here acts as an activator .",
    "the variable @xmath5 indicates an internal degree of freedom , e.g. , the interface charge density , and acts as an inhibitor . the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 describe the diffusion of interfaces charge carriers and the induced inhomogeneity of the voltage drop at the interface , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is an internal system parameter describing the tunneling rate , and @xmath9 is an external current density .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 denotes the ratio of the time scales of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the feedback intensities of variables @xmath5 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 is the delayed time . in the analysis ,",
    "we first consider a short delayed time , i.e. @xmath13 is a small value .",
    "so , we can expand the feedback terms eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) as : @xmath14 so , we obtain : @xmath15 it can be seen that the terms of time is rescaled and determined by the delayed time and the feedback intensities . in order to study the competition between the turing and hopf instabilities under time delay , we first perform the linear stability analysis of eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8) . the uniform steady states of eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8) are determined by the intersection points of the two nullclines : @xmath16    @xmath17@xmath18 , @xmath6@xmath17@xmath19 , @xmath10@xmath17@xmath20 , @xmath9@xmath17@xmath21 , @xmath8@xmath17@xmath22.,width=302,height=226 ]    obviously , the cubic nullcline of eq . ( 9 ) have a form of `` n '' as indicated in fig.1 . if the two nullclines intersect at a single point lying on the middle branch of the cubic nullcline , the system exhibits turing / hopf instabilities . if they intersect at one point lying on the outer branches of the cubic nullcline , the system owns excitable property .",
    "otherwise they intersect at three points , which corresponds to a bistable system . here",
    ", we only concentrate on the case of turing / hopf instabilities .",
    "the uniform steady state of the system reads @xmath23 then , we perturb the uniform steady state with small spatiotemporal perturbation ( @xmath24@xmath5 , @xmath24@xmath4 ) @xmath25 @xmath26 , and obtain the following matrix equation for eigenvalues : @xmath27 where , @xmath28@xmath17@xmath29 .",
    "so the characteristic equation reads as @xmath30 where , @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 the dispersion relations @xmath34 of the system are defined by the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( 13 ) , @xmath35 if the real parts of eigenvalues are positive , the uniform steady state becomes unstable to small perturbations .",
    "here , we focus on the temporal instability ( hopf mode ) and spatial instability ( turing mode ) , which correspond to @xmath36@xmath17@xmath37 and @xmath36@xmath38@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "figure 2 represents the dispersion relation and shows the effect of time delay on the competition between turing and hopf modes .",
    "it can be seen that the application of the time delay changes the oscillation frequency of the hopf instability and the intensities of both the turing mode and the hopf mode .",
    "therefore , it affects the results of competition between the hopf and turing modes . in the following",
    "we will discuss the effect of time delay on the hopf and turing instabilities , respectively .     with and without time delay .",
    "the thick and thin solid lines correspond to the real part of the eigenvalue with and without time delay , respectively .",
    "the thick and thin dash lines correspond to the image part of the eigenvalue with and without time , respectively .",
    "the feedback parameters are @xmath13@xmath17@xmath18 , @xmath11@xmath17@xmath39 , @xmath12@xmath17@xmath40 .",

    "( 18 ) it can be seen that the time delay changes the critical value of hopf bifurcation when the feedback @xmath11 and @xmath12 are applied with different intensities .",
    "this means that time delay with different feedback intensities can introduce the hopf instability to system , which is similar to the cases in refs .",
    "[ 13 , 14 ] .",
