    "recent experimental observations of the long - range azimuthal correlations in high - multiplicity proton - proton ( p+p ) @xcite and proton - nucleus ( p+a ) collisions cms:2012qk , abelev:2012ola , aad:2012gla , adare:2013piz shed some new light on our understanding of _ fireballs _ created in such interactions .    the measured two - particle correlation function as a function of the pseudorapidity separation , @xmath1 , and the relative azimuthal angle , @xmath2 , of two particles demonstrates a great deal of similarity to that measured in peripheral heavy - ion collisions chatrchyan:2013nka . in particular , two particles separated by",
    "many units of pseudorapidity prefer to have similar azimuthal angles thus the two - particle correlation function is peaked at @xmath3 .",
    "exactly the same phenomenon was observed in heavy - ion collisions where it is believed to originate from hydrodynamical evolution present in such interactions florkowski : book . in this picture the initial anisotropic distribution of matter , characterized e.g. by ellipticity , is translated to the final momentum anisotropy with @xmath4 term ( and higher harmonics ) in the correlation function .",
    "however , the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems , as the ones created in p+p and p+a interactions , is questionable and so far there is no consensus in this matter .",
    "nevertheless , hydrodynamics applied to p+p and p+a collisions results in qualitative and partly quantitative understanding of various sets of data bozek:2011if , shuryak:2013ke , bozek:2013uha , bzdak:2013zma , qin:2013bha , werner:2013tya , bozek:2013ska .",
    "on the other hand , the color glass condensate @xcite , the effective description of low - x gluons in the hadronic / nuclear wave function , results in equally good description of the two - particle correlation functions @xcite ( see also @xcite for a more qualitative discussion ) .",
    "the advantage of the cgc approach over hydrodynamics is its microscopic character and internal consistency . on the other hand , hydrodynamics naturally describes various sets of data for which the cgc predictions are often not clear .",
    "moreover , hydrodynamics provides a solid intuitive understanding of the observed signal which is not the case for the cgc . to summarize , at present we have two competing languages to understand small systems and it is crucial to establish the true origin of the long - range azimuthal correlation .",
    "several observables and arguments bzdak:2013zla , bozek:2013sda , coleman - smith:2013rla , bjorken:2013boa , mclerran:2013oju , rezaeian:2013woa , basar:2013hea , bzdak:2013rya , yan:2013laa , bzdak:2013raa , konchakovski:2014wqa , bzdak:2013lva , sickles:2013yna , noronha:2014vva were recently put forward which hopefully can help to resolve this interesting issue .    in this paper , we calculate the two - particle density function , @xmath5 , in p+p and p+pb collisions assuming the incoherent elastic scattering of partons , as present in a multi - phase transport model ( ampt ) @xcite .",
    "this approach is simple and intuitive , and more importantly is closely related to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the cascade model with the reasonable parton - parton cross - section , @xmath6 mb , was proved to be very successful in understanding many features of heavy - ion collision data , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this approach has one crucial advantage over hydrodynamics , namely , there is no need to assume local thermalization .",
    "so far such a calculation was not published and it is important to establish whether a simple incoherent scattering of partons with a reasonable partonic cross - section can generate the long - range structure in p+p and p+a two - particle correlation functions .",
    "our main result is that the incoherent elastic scattering of partons , with a partonic cross - section of @xmath7 mb , naturally generates the long - rage azimuthal correlation of charged particles both in p+p and p+a collisions .",
    "a near side peak at @xmath3 grows with the growing number of produced particles due to the growing density of partons , and consequently the larger number of partonic scatterings .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of the near - side peak is also reproduced that is , the signal at @xmath3 is best visible for @xmath9 gev/@xmath10 .    in the next section",
    "we give a brief introduction to the ampt model . in section [ sec : results ] we present our results for the two - particle correlation functions in p+p and p+a collisions for various multiplicity and @xmath8 bins .",
    "we finish our paper with comments in section  [ sec : comments ] and conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the ampt model with string melting mechanism is employed in this work ( for comparison we also show some results obtained in the default model ) .",
    "it is initialized with a spatial and momentum distribution of minijet partons and soft string excitations from the hijing model  @xcite .",
    "the string melting mechanism converts all excited strings into quarks and antiquarks according to the flavor and spin structures of their valence quarks ( in contrast to the default ampt model , where only partons from minijets are present ) .",
    "the evolution of a quark - antiquark plasma is modeled by a simple parton cascade . at present , the parton cascade includes only two - body elastic scatterings with a cross - section obtained from the pqcd with a screening mass  @xcite .",
    "clearly this is a simplified picture however , we believe it captures the main features of parton dynamics present at the early stage of a collision .",
    "the parton cascade is followed by the hadronization , where quarks are recombined into hadrons via a simple coalescence model .",
    "finally dynamics of the subsequent hadronic matter is described by a relativistic transport model  @xcite . for more details on the ampt model",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "the recent ampt studies show that the partonic cross - section of @xmath11 mb can describe many experimental observables at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "in particular it was found that the long - range azimuthal correlation can be produced by the parton scatterings in pb+pb collisions at @xmath12 tev  @xcite .",

    "as seen in figure [ fig : contour ] the initial size of a system in p+p is roughly a factor of @xmath23 smaller than that in p+a .",
    "we checked that in a p+p collision partons are produced mainly in the overlap region of the two colliding protons , leading to a characteristic elliptical shape in a typical p+p event . in a p+a collision ,",

    "is implemented to remove a constant background , @xmath31 . in this calculation",
    "we take the partonic cross - section to be @xmath32 mb .",
    "the ampt results ( solid and dashed curves ) are in very good agreement with the cms data ( full and open circles ) for the near - side peak , @xmath33 .",
    "the agreement with the away - side peak , @xmath34 , is less impressive however , this region is heavily populated by jets which are of lesser interest in the present investigation .",
    "it is worth noticing that at the same @xmath13 bin , the signal at @xmath3 in p+p collisions is noticeably smaller than that in p+a interactions .",
    "this feature agrees very well with the cms data .        in figure",
    "[ fig : ppb_main_2 ] we present the results for p+pb collisions calculated in the ampt model with various values of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 mb . we also show the result of the default ampt model , where only partons from minijets interact and all soft strings decay independently into particles . in this scenario",
    "the number of interacting partons is not sufficiently high to produce a visible effect . on the contrary , in the string melting scenario ( in which all initial soft strings melt into partons )",
    "the number of interacting partons is significantly larger , roughly a factor of @xmath37 , thus allowing to obtain a sizable signal .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : ppb_main_2 ] the strength of the signal gradually increases with growing @xmath38 and , as expected , the signal vanishes completely for @xmath39 mb .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that in the ampt model partonic scatterings are directly responsible for the signal at @xmath40 , as observed in figures [ fig : ppb_main ] and [ fig : ppb_main_2 ] .    , in p+pb collisions at @xmath20 tev as a function of the relative azimuthal angle @xmath41 averaged over @xmath42 for @xmath22 and @xmath9 gev/@xmath10 .",
    "our results ( curves ) from different ampt model settings are compared with the cms data ( points ) .",
    "in the default ampt model only few partons from minijets interact which is not sufficient to produce a sizable signal . in the string melting version",
    "all soft strings are converted into partons . ]    in the last part of the paper we address the problem of the @xmath8 particle spectra .",
    "the measured @xmath8 distributions evolve towards higher @xmath8 with an increasing number of produced particles @xcite . in principle",
    "this feature should be present in the ampt model with the string melting mechanism owning to the frequent parton - parton scatterings .",
    "however , in our model the hadronization mechanism is rather crude ( a simple coalescence ) thus we should not expect the model to be particularly successful in describing the spectra ( in contrast to the studied long - range rapidity correlation which presence or absence is independent on the particular mechanism of hadronization ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to investigate whether the ampt model can approximately reproduce the trends observed in the data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] we present the @xmath8 distributions of produced pions , kaons and protons in p+pb collisions for several centrality classes . the model , despite its simplicity , reproduces the cms data @xcite within the accuracy of @xmath43",
    ". the calculated spectra shift towards higher @xmath44 with an increasing number of produced particles , @xmath45 , as best visible in the rightmost plot ( p+p ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the incoherent scattering of partons with basically one essential parameter , @xmath46 mb , allows to capture the main features of the p+p and p+pb data for all measured multiplicities and the transverse momenta .",
    "this may be contrasted with the cgc framework @xcite where the saturation scale is fitted separately for each multiplicity and the colliding system .",
    "the presence of the near - side peak in our results originates from the parton scatterings at the early stage of a collision , see figure [ fig : ppb_main_2 ] .",
    "obviously the lifetime , @xmath47 , of the partonic stage increases with increasing number of initial partons , and consequently with @xmath13 .",
    "we checked that in p+pb collisions @xmath48 with @xmath49 and for @xmath50 the lifetime @xmath51 fm , respectively .",
    "in p+p collisions @xmath47 grows slowly from @xmath52 fm for @xmath53 to @xmath54 fm for @xmath55 .",
    "our results indicate that for small and rapidly expanding systems there is enough time for multiple parton scatterings which can translate the initial anisotropy of produced matter into the final momentum anisotropy .",
    "there are several problems in our approach that require further studies .",
    "for example only two - to - two elastic parton scatterings are included and higher order processes might become important at high densities . for a complete discussion of various problems in the partonic stage of the ampt model we refer the reader to section vii in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a transport model calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that a parton - parton cross - section of the order of @xmath56 mb is needed to generate a sizable elliptic flow in a+a collisions .",
    "however , in the ampt model a cross - section of the order of @xmath57 mb is enough to reproduce the a+a data",
    ". it would be interesting to understand the origin of this contradiction .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our goal was not to fit precisely the data .",
    "our objective was to check if a minimal implementation of partonic scatterings , with a reasonable cross - section , can roughly reproduce the experimental data for p+p and p+pb collisions .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : ppb_main_2 ] , the agreement with the experimental data is surprisingly good , suggesting that various shortcomings present in our approach are not very important",
    ".    it would be interesting to extend our discussion for peripheral pb+pb collisions .",
    "we leave this problem for a separate investigation .",
    "also the detailed discussion of the elliptic and triangular @xcite fourier coefficients will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated that the incoherent scattering of partons in the early stage of p+p and p+a collisions is sufficient to understand the near - side azimuthal correlation of particles separated by a large gap in pseudorapidity . using the multi - phase transport model ( ampt with string melting ) , with a parton - parton cross - section of @xmath11 mb , we calculated the two - particle correlation function as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath28 .",
    "the main trends observed in the data were successfully reproduced .",
    "the near - side peak at @xmath3 is gradually growing with the number of produced particles owing to the growing density of partons .",
    "this in consequence leads to more frequent parton - parton scatterings .",
    "moreover , the signal is best visible in the transverse momentum range @xmath9 gev/@xmath10 , being in agreement with the cms data .    in the default ampt model , where only partons from minijets interact and soft strings decay independently into particles ,",
    "the number of interacting partons is not sufficient to produce a visible signal .",
    "our study indicates that even in a very small system , as the one created in a p+p collision , there is enough time for partonic scatterings before the system becomes dilute .",
    "these scatterings translate the initial anisotropy of matter into the final momentum anisotropy , leading to the @xmath59 term ( and higher harmonics ) in the azimuthal correlation function .",
    "in this paper we focused solely on the main features of the two - particle correlation function .",
    "calculations of the elliptic and triangular fourier coefficients in p+p , p+a and peripheral a+a collisions are left for a separate investigation .",
