    "synthetic and biological polymers are always characterized by a certain degree of intrinsic stiffness , and hence fall within the general class of the so - called semiflexible polymers @xcite .",
    "sometimes , however , stiffness is neglected to first approximation , often because there exist other constraints concurring to provide an effective stiffness , thus rendering redundant its explicit inclusion .    in a discrete representation",
    ", a polymer can be modelled as a sequence of tethered beads where beads represent monomers , and connectivity between consecutive beads represent the effect of covalent chemical bonds holding the polymer together . in the simplest representation , angles between successive chain segments",
    "are uncorrelated , and the polymer is viewed as a brownian curve , with a spherical symmetric evolution .",
    "a slightly more realistic representation includes the excluded volume constraint accounting for the fact that non - consecutive beads ( i.e. monomers ) can not overlap being hard - core objects .",
    "this however , does not break the spherical symmetry of the chain , in the sense that each bead can have any position in space that does not violate both the connectivity and the excluded volume constraints . for this case , the edwards continuum model has been traditionally regarded as the paradigmatic description able to provide qualitative prediction of the phase diagram . a flexible polymer in a good solvent",
    "can thus be described by tethered beads model , or by the edwards model in its continuum version @xcite , in which only repulsive interactions , due to excluded volume , are enforced .",
    "the effect of a change in the solvent quality and/or by a decrease in the temperature , can be captured by introducing an additional short - range attraction between non - consecutive beads ( i.e. monomers ) , so there is a tendency of the polymer to collapse to a globular state that is counterbalanced by the excluded volume repulsion . at the mean - field level",
    ", these competitive interactions can be modelled by the well - known flory theory of polymers @xcite .",
    "as the introduced short - range attraction is still spherically symmetric , the isotropy condition is preserved even under these more general conditions .    many polymeric molecules , however , exhibit internal stiffness , as remarked . in this case , the angles between two successive segments are no longer uncorrelated , as in the case of flexible chains , but display nonvanishing correlations @xcite .",
    "for this systems , usually referred to as semi - flexible polymers , the simplest and most popular description is given by the so - called worm - like - chain ( wlc ) model , where there is an energy penalty in forming an angle between two successive segments of the chain .",
    "note that this constraint breaks the spherical symmetry present in flexible polymers .",
    "spatial correlation along the chain decays exponentially , thus introducing a persistence length , above which the chain is still uncorrelated , and hence flexible , that is directly related to the stiffness parameter .",
    "a typical example of stiff biopolymer is provided by dna , whose hybridized double strand form has a persistence length typically 100 times larger than that corresponding to each single strand @xcite .",
    "this property affects the corresponding phase diagram whose collapsed phase is found to be either a toroid or a rod - like phase , unlike the zero - stiffness flexible case , that is found to be a compact globule @xcite .",
    "native compact states in globular proteins are found within a rather different framework @xcite . here , polypeptide chains can still be regarded as bio - polymers displaying a high - temperature coil ( swollen ) phase , and a low - temperature collapsed phase , but with a number of specific features that drastically reduce the number of possible conformations , thus driving to a unique collapsed target conformation .",
    "while the precise mechanism with which this is achieved in real proteins is still to be fully understood , few ingredients are universally accepted to be part of this mechanism .",
    "one is the existence of directional interactions ( i.e. hydrogen bonds ) that are broken with the solvent and reformed within the protein backbone , upon collapse . within the implicit model description used in the present paper ,",
    "this amounts to breaking the spherical symmetry of the interactions alluded earlier @xcite .",
    "a second crucial feature making a polypeptide chain very different from a synthetic polymer is given by the presence of side chains that stick out in a plane normal to the protein backbone .",
    "as a matter - of - fact , the primary structure of a protein is formed by a sequence of aminoacid residues whose structure is always the same apart from the side chains whose specificities can be extracted from an alphabet of 20 possible letters @xcite .",
    "different side chains give rise to different directional interactions , as well as to different packing constraints as they must be accommodated upon folding in a way to avoid steric clashes .    in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have analyzed the consequences of the inclusion of both constraints on the phase diagram of the folded phase .",
    "the first constraint was enforced via partial overlapping of consecutive beads , while the second by introducing smaller dummy ( i.e. inert hard spheres ) spherical beads , mimicking the steric hindrance of side chains , at appropriate positions .",
    "it was found that a combination of both these ingredients was able to account for the presence of stable secondary structures , such as helices and beta - like sheets , while each of them , taken singularly , was likely to run into kinetic trapping issues .    in this paper , we build on this idea and study the detailed reason behind these results .",
    "we find that the combination of the two ingredients promotes an effective stiffness that drives the correct folding , and quantify the dependence of the persistence length as a function of temperature and interpenetration .",
    "finally , we compare with results stemming from an alternative way of inducing an effective stiffness , and discuss the compatibility of the two models .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .    in section [ sec : opsc_model ]",
    "we introduce the model and how this induces a bending rigidity .",
    "section [ sec : numerical ] gives a brief review of the numerical methods employed , as well as the order parameters used to discriminate between the phases .",
    "sections [ sec : effective ] and [ sec : persistence ] discuss the dependence of the persistence length on both temperature , local interpenetration , and chain lengths .",
    "finally , section [ sec : alternative ] reports a comparison with the model in which there is an infinite energy penalty for large bending and section [ sec : conclusions ] draws some conclusions and discusses open future perspectives .",
    "a common representation of a polymer is provided by a sequence of @xmath0 beads ( monomers ) , placed at position @xmath1 in space , each of diameter @xmath2 , connected by a tethering potential holding consecutive beads at a fixed distance @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "excluded volume and solvent effects are accounted via an additional potential ensuring that non - consecutive beads can not interpenetrate , and attract each other with an energy @xmath4 provided that their relative distance is not larger than the interaction range @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "this additional hard - core square - well ( sw ) potential can then be written @xmath7 the model is further defined by imposing the additional constraint that the monomer - monomer distance @xmath3 coincides with the bead diameter @xmath2 , so that consecutive beads are tangent to each other ( @xmath8 ) . in this case , each monomer can assume any position in space , provided the connectivity constraint to be satisfied .",
    "this spherical symmetry combines with the connectivity constraint to produce a flexible polymer .",
    "an effective stiffness can however be induced by allowing partial interpenetration between consecutive spheres , so that @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "instead of free joints , the wlc model admits an energetic penalty every time two consecutive bonds are not parallel . denoting by @xmath17 the angle between two consecutive bonds , the wlc model assumes a bending energy proportional to @xmath18 , with a proportionality constant @xmath19 ( the stiffness ) having dimensions of an energy times a length @xmath20 .",
    "the latter , can be identified as the persistent length , the characteristic length appearing in the decay of the tangent - tangent correlation function along the chain ( see below ) .    in discussing the tangent - tangent correlations",
    ", it proves convenient to identify the axis of the chain by a curve coordinate @xmath21 parameterized by its arc length @xmath22 , that is the continuum version of @xmath23 and @xmath24 previously introduced , respectively .",
    "calculations can then be performed in an efficient way by referring to a particular frenet frame of unit vectors @xmath25 for the tangent , normal and binormal respectively , that are defined as follows @xmath26 here primes denote the derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "the frenet - serret local coordinates are related by the frenet - serret equations @xcite @xmath27 these equations automatically define the curvature @xmath28 and the torsion @xmath29 as given in the first and the last equations of ( [ eq : frenet - serret ] ) . in numerical calculations , however , the discrete version of the frenet - serret coordinates and equations will be used . denoting    @xmath30    as the unit vector associated with the bond length @xmath31 , translational invariance suggests the tangent - tangent correlations @xmath32 to depend only upon the difference @xmath33 , so that @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a flexible chain , the persistence length @xmath35 as the correlation ( [ eq : persistence ] ) drops to zero after a length of the order of a single monomer . in this case , the maximum angle between two consecutive bonds can be as large as @xmath36 , as illustrated in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ( left ) .",

    ", we have shown that this problem can be overcome by introducing smaller beads , having diameter @xmath39 , and positioned along the chain so to mimic the side chains in real proteins .",
    "for each of non - terminal backbone beads , one defines a normal vector as @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",

    "to each backbone bead a side chain bead is attached in the anti - normal direction with the position given by @xmath44 the potentials involving side chain beads are just hardcore repulsions that vanish when @xmath45 .",
    "following the convention set out in our previous paper @xcite , we shall refer to this model as the overlapping polymer with side chains ( opsc ) .",
    "our numerical approach hinges on a combination of two different methods , the microcanonical wang - landau ( wl)@xcite and the canonical replica exchange @xcite here , we summarize the main points of both methods , referring to our previous work @xcite , as well as references therein , for additional details .",
    "aim of the wl approach is to compute the density of states @xmath46 in the micro - canonical ensemble , from which the whole thermodynamics can be derived in terms of the canonical partition function @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the boltzmann constant .    in order to compute @xmath46 in wl method @xcite we sample polymer conformations according to micro - canonical distribution , by generating a sequence of chain conformations @xmath49 , and accepting new configuration @xmath50 with the micro - canonical acceptance probability @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are weight factors ensuring the microscopic reversibility of the moves .",

    "the efficiency of a parallel tempering scheme depends on the number of replicas , the set of temperatures chosen to run the simulations , how frequently the swap moves are attempted , and is still a matter of debate .",

    "is observed , clearly distinct from a helical phase .",
    "this agrees with previous findings within the dna condensation framework @xcite .",
    "by contrast , no such toroidal phase is observed in the op model with the same stiffness .",

    "the latter represent either monomers , in the polymer language , or amino - acids in protein domain .    as overlap increases from no - overlap ( @xmath8 ) to the maximum overlap limit ( @xmath38 ) , the local curvature of the chain is affected and we have discussed how and why this can be reckoned as an increasing entropic bending rigidity that competes with the short - range attraction to give different low - temperature phases . in the flexible limit ( @xmath8 )",
    "we find a coil - globule transition as expected from conventional synthetic polymers . as this",
    "ratio decreases down to @xmath87 ( and hence stiffness increases ) , we find a clear signature of a planar - like low temperature phase , reminiscent of the @xmath89sheet secondary structure in globular proteins . upon",
    "further decrease down to @xmath90 an equally clear signature of a coil - helix transition is found at low temperatures .",
    "we argued that the physical origin of this distinction between these two phases can be traced back to the combined effect of increased entropic stiffness of the local curvature and a change in the excluded volume .",
    "while helical phases were found in past models involving overlapping of consecutive monomers , the present work is the first , to the best of our knowledge , to show that a certain degree of overlap combined with the effect provided by the side chains , can lead to a beta - sheet phase .",
    "we have then compared the above findings with those originating from the @xmath123 model with side chains , where the effective bending rigidity has an energetic origin . here",
    "the crucial difference from the opsc model stems from the fact that there is no interpenetration between consecutive beads , but an explicit infinitely large energy penalty is given for bending of consecutive bonds above a given angle @xmath13 , with no penalty below it . with decreasing @xmath13 , stiffness increases and we find an exact geometrical mapping connecting the @xmath123 model with side chains with the opsc model . in full agreement with this mapping , we find that the dependence of the persistence length of the two models in terms of the stiffness to be identical at intermediate temperatures , where the chain is in the coil but stiff conformation .",
    "conversely , at low temperatures , we find the @xmath123 model with side chains to display only globular and hybrid phases for the same values of stiffness . for higher bending rigidity and in the absence of side chains , the @xmath123 model displays toroidal phases as it was found in refs .",
    "@xcite this means that explicit energetic bending rigidity is _ not _ compatible with secondary structures typically found in proteins , even in the presence of side chains . this notwithstanding , it is still noteworthy that the @xmath123 model with side chains and the opsc share the same phenomenology at intermediate temperatures in terms of an effective stiff coil conformation , and that this is true whether or not side chains are present .",
    "interestingly , the opsc model shares strong similarities with the tube model , introduced by maritan et al in ref.@xcite and further reviewed in refs . @xcite . in that case , the combined role of entropic bending rigidity and steric effect of the side chains , is played by the thickness of the tube .",
    "indeed , this model was shown to display _ both _ beta - like and helical phases upon optimal packing requirement and increasing the range of short - range attractive interactions @xcite , in agreement with what presented here .",
    "the results presented in this paper open up a number of perspectives that we plan to investigate in a future work .",
    "a finite - size dependence study , in terms of increasing the length @xmath0 and of decreasing the side chain beads size @xmath144 , is clearly desirable",
    ". a clear - cut comparison with the tube model in terms of similarities and differences would also be useful @xcite .",
    "another interesting point would be to add a short - range interaction between the side - chain beads , that was suggested to mimic the effect of hydrogen bonding @xcite .",
    "more generally , it would be interesting to pursue the effect of additional ingredients to the opsc model discussed here , in the strive towards a more realistic description of protein - like systems .",
