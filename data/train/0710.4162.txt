    "one of the key remaining signatures of inflation , tensor perturbations ( i.e.  gravitational waves )  @xcite , has yet to be detected .",
    "depending on the amplitude of the tensor perturbations , which is not well constrained theoretically , it may be possible to measure the angular power spectrum of the inflationary gravitational waves in the @xmath0-mode component of the cmb polarization on large scales .",
    "non - detection of the tensor spectrum does not necessarily rule out inflation , but upper limits on @xmath2 can be used to exclude particular models of inflation and limit its energy scale .",
    "many experiments have been proposed to search for this signal  @xcite .",
    "measurement of tensor perturbations in the @xmath0-mode polarization power spectrum would test models of inflation by constraining inflationary parameters .",
    "these parameters include the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath2 , and the tensor spectral index , @xmath3 , which are related by a consistency relation under the simplest single - field slow - roll inflationary scenarios .",
    "if the tensor spectrum can be detected , precise measurements over a wide range of scales could test the consistency relation .",
    "cmb constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend on the ability to accurately determine the large - scale power in @xmath0-modes due to tensor perturbations , independent of the effects of other cosmological parameters . on the largest scales ,",
    "the tensor @xmath0-mode spectrum depends not only on inflationary parameters but also on the reionization history of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the main impact of reionization on the spectrum is through the total optical depth , @xmath4 .",
    "the 3-year _ wmap _  measurements of @xmath1-mode polarization determine @xmath4 to an accuracy of about @xmath5  @xcite , and future cmb experiments should constrain @xmath4 at the  @xmath6  level  @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed evolution of the reionization history also significantly affects the large - scale polarization spectra .",
    "uncertainty in this history leads to added uncertainty in inflationary parameters . moreover , incorrect inferences due to an oversimplified treatment of reionization may bias estimates of inflationary parameters . for unbiased estimation of the optical depth from the @xmath1-mode reionization peak ,",
    "the solution is to use a complete , principal - component - based description of reionization effects when estimating parameters from cmb polarization data  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we extend this approach to tensor @xmath0-mode polarization and show that it is equally if not more effective in ensuring accurate measurements with little loss in precision .",

    "like the scalar @xmath1-mode polarization power spectrum , the tensor @xmath0-mode spectrum @xmath7 consists of two main components : one from recombination that peaks at @xmath8 , and the other from the epoch of reionization , which peaks near @xmath9 and dominates at @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : degen ] ) . in the tensor power spectrum , these components arise from wavenumbers @xmath11 mpc@xmath12 and @xmath13 mpc@xmath12 respectively .",
    "they provide a lever arm of over a decade in physical scale for measuring the tensor tilt . this lever arm is slightly shortened compared with the ratio of angular scales due to the closer distance to reionization .",

    "* ) , @xmath14 between the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 and tensor tilt @xmath3 .",
    "deviations from the consistency relation and running of the tilt come in at second order in the slow - roll parameters .",

    "wmap_.    note that we quote @xmath2 at a normalization scale of @xmath15 mpc@xmath12 whereas 3-year _ wmap _  results quote it at @xmath16 mpc@xmath12 and camb defaults to @xmath17 mpc@xmath12 . our choice , corresponding to the recombination peak at @xmath18 , better reflects the scale at which the tensor spectrum can be best measured .",
    "we will use subscripts to denote choices of scale other than @xmath19  mpc@xmath12 , e.g. @xmath20 for normalization at @xmath17  mpc@xmath12 , so that @xmath21 assuming no running of the scalar or tensor spectral indices .",
    "since we only consider small deviations from scale - invariance , the tensor - to - scalar ratio varies little with the normalization scale so any corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : consrel ] ) due to changing @xmath22 are correspondingly small .",
    "cosmic variance and reionization history uncertainties in the interpretation of the reionization peak limit the ability to measure the spectrum from this technique . in fig .",

    "[ fig : degen ] shows that there are at least two ways of breaking this degeneracy .",
    "one is by measuring the tensor spectrum at @xmath25 , where the tilt of the spectrum matters but the optical depth has no effect other than an overall rescaling of the spectrum by @xmath26 , which we absorb by changing the scalar amplitude @xmath27 to keep @xmath28 fixed . just as in the scalar case ,",
    "if the tensor spectrum can be precisely measured beyond the recombination peak , the global constraint on @xmath3 will not be sensitive to reionization .",
    "unlike the scalar case , @xmath7 falls sharply at higher @xmath23 and becomes masked by @xmath0-modes generated by lensing of @xmath1-modes  @xcite ( @xmath29 ; see fig .",

    "the power in the lensing @xmath0-modes is expected to be greatest at @xmath30 , a smaller scale than the reionization and recombination peaks of the tensor spectrum .",
    "the relative amplitude of the tensor and lensing contributions to @xmath31 depends on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , which the 3-year _ wmap _   data restrict to @xmath32  @xcite .",

    ", the best cmb constraints on @xmath3 will come from the combination of the recombination and reionization peaks unless the lensing signal can be subtracted directly from the polarization maps  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33 degeneracy is also broken through the constraint on @xmath4 from the @xmath1-mode reionization peak , which depends on @xmath4 but not @xmath3 as long as @xmath2 is small enough that @xmath34 is dominated by scalar perturbations . to break the degeneracy in this way ,",
    "it is important to have accurate constraints on @xmath4 that do not depend on overly simplistic assumptions about the reionization history .",

    "[ fig : cl ] , we illustrate two models with similar optical depths but different reionization histories .",
    "a model - dependent analysis of the polarization power spectrum that uses an incorrect form of @xmath35 can result in significant bias in the total optical depth to reionization  @xcite . to the extent that the constraint on @xmath3 relies on measurements of the reionization peak of @xmath7",
    ", it may be biased as well in such an analysis .",
    "we shall see that the use of model - independent principal components of the reionization history protects against such biases at little cost to the precision of the inflationary test .",
    "following  @xcite , we parametrize the reionization history as a free function of redshift by decomposing @xmath35 into its principal components with respect to the @xmath1-mode polarization of the cmb : @xmath36 where the principal components , @xmath37 , are the eigenfunctions of the fisher matrix that describes the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath35 , @xmath38 are the amplitudes of the principal components for a particular reionization history , and @xmath39 is the fiducial model at which the fisher matrix is computed . in practice , we construct the principal components assuming @xmath1-mode information only by taking the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath40 . for allowed values of @xmath2 ,",

    "measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are only affected by the assumed form of the reionization history if the reionization peak of the tensor @xmath0-mode spectrum at the very largest scales is needed to precisely constrain the parameters .",
    "if , instead , good constraints can be obtained using only the @xmath0-mode recombination peak at intermediate scales , then assumptions about reionization do not affect tests of the consistency relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "they would instead appear as false evidence for running of the tensor tilt in violation of slow - roll expectations .",
    "measurement of the recombination peak however is inhibited by experimental noise and contamination from @xmath1-mode power converted to @xmath0-mode power by gravitational lensing , both of which become more important at smaller scales .",
    "to study the potential impact of reionization on parameter constraints from @xmath0-mode polarization , we have employed a markov chain monte carlo analysis of simulated cmb polarization power spectra and compared results for two descriptions of reionization : a simple , one - parameter , instantaneous reionization model , and a parametrization using principal components of the reionization history with respect to the @xmath1-mode polarization power spectrum .    by varying the properties of the simulated polarization power spectra , including the fiducial tensor - to - scalar ratio and the noise spectrum , we have determined over what range of scales cmb polarization data is most important for constraining inflationary parameters in various scenarios .",
    "in particular , the question of whether the large - scale reionization peak of @xmath7 or the smaller - scale recombination peak is more important determines the severity of bias in inflationary parameters when reionization is modeled incorrectly .",
    "if the tensor - to - scalar ratio is near the current upper limit of @xmath116 and measurements of @xmath0-mode polarization are limited only by cosmic variance , then the spectrum on scales @xmath103 dominates constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath3 and incorrect assumptions about reionization do not strongly bias the results . if the true tensor - to - scalar ratio is more than a factor of a few smaller than this upper bound , however , then lensing @xmath0-modes limit the information that can be extracted from the recombination peak of the tensor spectrum alone .",
    "furthermore , all - sky experiments in the foreseeable future are likely to have noise that exceeds the lensing signal , making tests of inflation even more reliant on the reionization peak of the tensor @xmath0-modes on large scales . in all of these cases , a general parametrization of reionization such as that provided by principal components allows the use of the @xmath0-mode reionization peak for inflationary parameter constraints without significantly worsening the errors on those parameters .",

    "<S> estimates of inflationary parameters from the cmb @xmath0-mode polarization spectrum on the largest scales depend on knowledge of the reionization history , especially at low tensor - to - scalar ratio . assuming an incorrect reionization history in the analysis of such polarization data can strongly bias the inflationary parameters . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence is that the single - field slow - roll consistency relation between the tensor - to - scalar ratio and tensor tilt might be excluded with high significance even if this relation holds in reality . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the origin of the bias and present case studies with various tensor amplitudes and noise characteristics . a more model - independent approach can account for uncertainties about reionization , and we show that parametrizing the reionization history by a set of its principal components with respect to @xmath1-mode polarization removes the bias in inflationary parameter measurement with little degradation in precision . </S>"
