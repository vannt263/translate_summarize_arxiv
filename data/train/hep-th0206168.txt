    "some important physical quantities displaying quantization properties , may sometimes be represented by means of _ momentum _ space integrals which exhibit their topologically invariant character .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to find these representations , since they are often very useful to prove their quantization , as well as their stability under perturbations .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the transverse conductivity @xmath3 in @xmath4 , which can be represented as a momentum space integral given by @xcite @xmath5 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the full fermion propagator .",
    "as shown in @xcite , due to the ultraviolet behavior of the fermion propagator , this integral reduces to the kronecker topological invariant which labels the homotopy classes in @xmath7 , that is , @xmath3 is quantized .",
    "a similar representation for the induced chern - simons coefficient has been obtained in  @xcite by using a cubic lattice regularization for the euclidean fermionic action . in this case , the possible values for the chern - simons coefficient turn out to be labeled by the winding number characterizing the mapping between the three - dimensional torus in momentum space and the normalized quaternion corresponding to the fermion propagator : @xmath8 .",
    "topology in momentum space has also been advocated in  @xcite , in order to discuss the stability of neutrino masses in the standard model and the spectrum of excitations in effective two dimensional models such as helium-3 . on the other hand , in the context of yang - mills theories ,",
    "one of the main open problems is that of understanding the non - perturbative generation of a mass gap for the gauge fields as a consequence of the dynamics in the infrared regime .",
    "this problem is of crucial importance for confinement in qcd , and for analyzing finite temperature effects .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite , a gap equation , based on the introduction of gauge invariant mass terms , has been proposed and applied to the yang - mills theory in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the aim of this work is to obtain a useful momentum space representation for detecting the existence of an induced gauge invariant mass , @xmath0 , for an abelian gauge field . in particular",
    ", we shall be able to derive a general expression for @xmath0 , valid for different space - time dimensions and geometries in momentum space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 1 is devoted to a short review of the well - known relationship between the induced gauge invariant mass and the chiral anomaly in @xmath1 dimensions . in section 2 , a general momentum space representation for the induced gauge invariant mass",
    "is provided .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the applications of the aforementioned representation to the case of square lattice geometry and to the case of finite temperature in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] presents our conclusions .",
    "by gauge invariant mass , @xmath0 , we understand the value of the constant appearing in a gauge invariant mass term for an abelian gauge field . in @xmath9 dimensional euclidean spacetime ,",
    "a gauge invariant mass term lagrangian @xmath10 is given explicitly by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transverse kronecker @xmath13 in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "this mass term for @xmath15 is explicitly gauge invariant , although , of course , at the price of introducing a non - locality in the action .",
    "that is often the reason for not including this term in the classical lagrangian of a standard local quantum field theory . in spite of this fact ,",
    "terms like this naturally arise when evaluating radiative corrections to the effective action . in _",
    "@xmath16 in @xmath1 dimensions , i.e. , the schwinger model  @xcite , it is induced by the one - loop vacuum polarization graph .",
    "moreover , for such a model , the one - loop result is exact , since it does not suffer from higher order corrections .",
    "these results can also be shown to be related to the chiral anomaly in @xmath1 dimensions , whence the non - renormalization of @xmath0 is inherited .",
    "for this model , the non - locality can be made good since , in the bosonization approach , the gauge field may be written in terms of two scalar fields : @xmath17 . in terms of these scalars ,",
    "the gauge invariant mass term becomes a standard , local , mass term for the @xmath3 field .    in the @xmath1",
    "dimensional case , the value of @xmath0 for a single fermionic flavor has the well - known value @xmath18 . in this article , we are interested in deriving general expressions for @xmath0 , as a first step to extending the useful @xmath1 dimensional result into several non trivial directions . in order to define the problem more",
    "precisely , we write @xmath0 in terms of the exact vacuum polarization tensor   @xmath19 .",
    "the ward identity for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , allows us to write : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a scalar function .",
    "thus @xmath0 may also be obtained as : @xmath23 this definition implicitly assumes gauge and lorentz invariance , two conditions that , except explicit indication on the contrary , shall be maintained in everything that follows .",
    "we shall be first concerned with models that can be described by an euclidean action with the following structure : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the fermion and gauge field lagrangians , respectively .",
    "let us begin with a consideration of the @xmath1 dimensional case , in the simplest non - trivial situation of massless @xmath27 .",
    "this will amount to a re - derivation of known results , although we shall present them here from a different perspective .",
    "the gauge field lagrangian is @xmath28 while fermionic matter is described by a massless dirac field @xmath29 , with a lagrangian : @xmath30 where we adopted the conventions : @xmath31 @xmath32    the exact vacuum polarization tensor @xmath33 is , as usual , defined in terms of the connected gauge field two - point function @xmath34 by : @xmath35 it is easy to see that there is , indeed , a relation between @xmath0 and the chiral anomaly @xmath36 , since the former may actually be derived from the latter , at least for massless @xmath16 in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "to that end , we define @xmath36 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the quantum average of the axial current in the presence of an external gauge field @xmath39 ( we use the cursive @xmath40 notation to distinguish it from the _ dynamical _ gauge field @xmath15 ) .",
    "hence , the integrated form of the anomaly @xcite is @xmath41 where we used the relation : @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the vector current . then , from our knowledge of the chiral anomaly , we may use the fact that @xmath44 is linear in @xmath45 to adopt the linear approximation for @xmath46 in ( [ eq : defanom1 ] ) , namely @xmath47 with @xmath48 denoting the coordinate space vacuum polarization function .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath48 appearing in ( [ eq : linear ] ) is exact , since only an expansion in the external field has been performed .    inserting then ( [ eq : linear ] ) into ( [ eq : defanom ] ) and fourier transforming",
    ", we find that : @xmath49 assuming that both limits exist . taking ( [ eq : pi0 ] ) into account ,",
    "this amounts to : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total flux of @xmath52 in euclidean spacetime .",
    "equation ( [ eq : anom2 ] ) yields @xmath0 in terms of the anomaly .",
    "of course , the left hand side in equation ( [ eq : anom2 ] ) being the spacetime integral of the anomaly , will have the form of a coefficient times @xmath53 , namely : @xmath54 thus the content of ( [ eq : anom2 ] ) is that the coefficient @xmath55 gives precisely the value of @xmath56 .",
    "now , only configurations with @xmath57 may have a finite action , and this implies that @xmath58 could have only been @xmath59 or an integer multiple of this quantity , i.e. , @xmath60    it must of course be possible to prove this quantization , starting from the fermionic side of the problem .",
    "indeed , this is the case for the one - loop approximation , since we also know that , to that order , the integral of the anomaly is in fact the index of the dirac operator , namely : @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the number of zero modes of positive and negative chirality in the given background . in our conventions , it is easy to realize that .    in the case in which a current - current interaction is introduced ,",
    "the corresponding effect can be evaluated by means of the bosonization rules , which give @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the current - current coupling constant .",
    "this relationship would imply , through equation ( [ eq : anom2 ] ) , a renormalized gauge invariant mass , in agreement with the result of ref.@xcite .    also , when the fermions are massive , the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : defanom ] ) has to be supplemented with the additional term @xmath65 coming from the explicit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "accordingly , equation ( [ eq : anom1 ] ) reads @xmath66 due to the short ranged behavior of the massive dirac fields , the left hand side identically vanishes , which together with equation ( [ eq : pi0 ] ) gives a zero gauge invariant mass @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , this implies that the contribution of the chiral anomaly cancels against that of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking term  @xcite .",
    "we try , in what follows , to use the fermionic point of view exclusively , in an attempt to derive the previous results therefrom , without assuming that a loop expansion has been performed . to that end , let us derive an exact expression for @xmath0 in terms of the fermion propagator .",
    "we start from the ( @xmath67-dimensional ) general expression for @xmath33 , as given by the schwinger - dyson equations  @xcite , which amount to the diagram of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ,    ( 0,0 )    # 1#2#3#4#5 @font    ( 6703,3580)(1425,-4337 ) ( 2251,-2311)(0,0)[lb ] ( 7276,-2311)(0,0)[lb ] ( 4651,-961)(0,0)[lb ] ( 6376,-3286)(0,0)[lb ] ( 2851,-3286)(0,0)[lb ] ( 4726,-3436)(0,0)[lb ]    where the white blobs are included to mean that the lines are full fermion propagators , while the black blob represents the full vertex functions .",
    "the external legs are of course to be truncated , but we have drawn them for the sake of clarity . the analytic expression corresponding to figure  [ fig : fig1 ] is @xmath68\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the momentum propagator and @xmath70 the exact vertex function .",
    "noting that @xmath71 may be expressed as in ( [ eq : pimn ] ) , we see that @xmath72 or @xmath73\\;.\\ ] ] since the theory is gauge invariant , we may relate @xmath74 to the fermion propagator , by using the exact ward identity : @xmath75 this identity may be used in ( [ eq : mg1 ] ) to obtain @xmath76\\;\\ ] ] @xmath77\\;,\\ ] ] which is an expression we shall consider in detail below .",
    "it is still formal , in the sense that we have not yet made explicit any regularization method .    before exploring its divergences in the general case ,",

    "this procedure yields @xmath85\\ ] ] which in the @xmath86 limit becomes : @xmath87 as it should be .",
    "the procedure we have followed has a simple electrostatic analogy : @xmath0 is given by the integral of the divergence of an ` electric field ' , so by following that analogy it is proportional to the total ` electric charge ' . because of the regulator , though , only the charges at the origin are relevant ; namely , the subtraction due to the uv regulator leads to : @xmath88\\ ] ] where the integral is taken along a small curve of radius @xmath79 enclosing the origin .",
    "@xmath89 denotes the outer normal to @xmath90 . in what follows",
    "we shall argue that this kind of expression can be generalized to the full theory .",
    "indeed , we can always say that the role of _ any _ uv regularization will be to modify the large momentum behavior of the propagator , in such a way that all the points with infinite momentum can be identified . for the pauli - villars case ,",
    "this can be shown to hold simply by combining the contributions of both fermion propagators into one integral , to define a regularized propagator .",
    "namely , @xmath91 \\;,\\ ] ] which contains the divergence ( in momentum space ) of a vector field which decreases as @xmath92 at infinity",
    ".    this will be one of the properties we shall demand of a regularization at any finite order of the loop expansion ; namely , the points at infinity in the momentum space may , from the point of view of this calculation , be identified .",
    "the other condition is that , in the small momentum region , i.e.  momenta much smaller than the cutoff , the behavior of the propagator should be the same as for the unregularized propagator .",
    "thus only the small region around zero may contribute .",
    "this , in turn , will produce a non - vanishing answer only when the field is massless , as we shall see now .    assuming a standard dirac action for the fermions , the general form of the fermion propagator in momentum space is , of course , @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are real functions that depend only on the scalar @xmath96 . then an application of ( [ eq : mg2 ] ) yields : @xmath97\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath98\\ ] ] where @xmath99 counts the dimension of the dirac algebra representation . evaluating the integral along @xmath90 , @xmath100 since @xmath86",
    ", we may conclude from here that , if the fermion is massive , @xmath101 , then @xmath102 .",
    "this is indeed the case for the massive schwinger model .",
    "regarding the massless case , we obtain : @xmath103 where we have used the normalization condition @xmath104 , which holds at any finite order of the loop expansion .",
    "this condition fixes the residue of the perturbative electron propagator at the pole @xmath105 . strictly speaking",
    ", this normalization will change in an interacting theory .",
    "indeed , the fermion propagator can in general , be rewritten by using the spectral representation  @xcite : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are real functions .",
    "it is then clear , by the linearity of this expression , that there will be a finite gauge invariant mass if there is an isolated pole at zero momentum , namely , if we can write : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the multiparticle threshold . in this situation , we would obtain , @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a constant , smaller that @xmath113 because of the spectral condition : @xmath114 equation ( [ eq : mg13 ] ) may seem to contradict our remarks on the relation between @xmath115 and the anomaly , for example ( [ eq : quant ] ) .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox is that the anomaly , as we understood it in ( [ eq : defanom ] ) , is defined in terms of the divergence of the current .",
    "the matrix elements of this current , when evaluated through the reduction formulae , will require the introduction of a @xmath112 factor ( @xmath116 for each fermionic field ) , thus the proper relation that generalizes ( [ eq : quant ] ) is : @xmath117    the original expression for @xmath0 required a regularization procedure in order to be well defined .",
    "however , being determined by the low momentum behavior of the propagator , @xmath0 should be independent of the regularization .",
    "for example , for a generalized pauli - villars regularization in the one - loop case , one might include a set of @xmath118 regulator fields , and define : @xmath119 where @xmath120 denote the regularizing masses , and the index @xmath121 is reserved for the unregularized propagator , which has @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the masses @xmath120 and the coefficients @xmath124 for @xmath125 are chosen in order to verify the desired behavior in the uv . however , since only the behavior around zero momentum is relevant , and all the regulators are massive , then just the unregularized massless propagator contributes .",
    "it should be clear from what we have said above that the geometry of the momentum space is crucial in the problem of evaluating @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting example of this is the case of a lattice regularized theory . indeed , assuming that the coordinate space has been discretized to an ( infinite ) square lattice with lattice spacing @xmath126 ,",
    "the momentum space becomes a ( continuous ) torus .",
    "the lattice points are defined then as the set of points @xmath127 with @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "the naive ( i.e. , no wilson term ) lattice fermion propagator for a massive dirac fermion then becomes : @xmath130 where @xmath131 , and the @xmath132 are continuous variables ( because the lattice is infinite ) , in the first brillouin zone , namely : @xmath133 then , the expression for @xmath0 is : @xmath134\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath135 denotes the first brillouin zone .",
    "the fact that we are dealing with a momentum torus is obvious because of the periodicity of the functions @xmath136 , a property which is preserved of course for more general propagators .",
    "but the functions @xmath136 will simultaneously vanish for the @xmath137 values in the set @xmath138 which contain not just the origin but also three other unwanted points . the behavior of the lattice propagator is identical for each of these points , and equal to the one in the continuum propagator .",
    "indeed , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is any of the points where both @xmath136 s vanish .",
    "then , when @xmath141 , an application of the gauss law on the torus , with the circles around the four poles of the propagator excluded yields four times the contribution of the physical pole at zero .",
    "this is because of the contribution of the ` charges ' at the doublers .",
    "this is just a manifestation of the ` doubling ' problem of lattice fermions , related to the nielsen - ninomiya theorem  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath142_{lattice } \\;=\\ ; 4 \\frac{e^2}{\\pi } \\;.\\ ] ]      another circumstance where the structure of momentum space allows for the emergence of a non - trivial gauge invariant mass , is the case of @xmath16 in @xmath2 dimensions at finite temperature in the presence of ` large ' @xmath143 field configurations  @xcite .",
    "parity conserving versions of @xmath144 , like the model introduced by dorey and mavromatos  @xcite have been extensively studied as quantum field theory models at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "most of what we shall say about this here , however , holds true both for the parity conserving and the parity breaking cases .",
    "we now discuss @xmath144 with regards only to one of its aspects , namely , its gauge invariant mass .",
    "we recall that in finite temperature quantum field theory lorentz invariance is lost . indeed ,",
    "in the matsubara formalism , which we shall adopt , the time coordinate runs from @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "this lack of lorentz invariance implies that one shall , in principle , have different masses for the spatial and temporal components of the gauge field .",
    "namely , the natural extension of ( [ eq : defmt ] ) to this case would be @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the transverse kronecker @xmath13 for the @xmath149 spatial dimensions , and @xmath150 is the imaginary time .",
    "the two components @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the electric and magnetic masses , which can of course be different for @xmath153 .",
    "these two masses play the role of components of a ` mass tensor ' for @xmath15 .",
    "we shall deal exclusively with the magnetic mass .",
    "it is not difficult to apply a similar derivation to the one used for the @xmath154 case , to obtain @xmath155\\ ] ] where the sum runs over the matsubara frequencies @xmath156 , and @xmath69 is the finite temperature fermion propagator .    for the free , massless fermion propagator in the presence of a large @xmath143",
    ", we have  @xcite : @xmath157 where @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath143 is assumed to be constant , a fact what can always be achieved by a small gauge transformation .",
    "the value of this constant is of course determined by the quantity @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is an arbitrary time dependent configuration .",
    "then , @xmath161 which looks like a series of @xmath1 dimensional contributions . of course , whenever @xmath162 , we have a non - vanishing contribution , of the same kind as those appearing in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "that condition on @xmath143 amounts to @xmath163 thus , we may write the result for @xmath164 as : @xmath165 \\;.\\ ] ]    the @xmath166 dependence should have been expected by dimensional analysis , since in @xmath2 dimensions @xmath167 has the units of a mass .",
    "regarding the existence of particular points where the magnetic mass is generated , the physical reason for that is that when the condition for @xmath143 is met , dimensional reduction occurs because there is a massless mode , and the reduced model is then tantamount to a schwinger model .",
    "in this work a useful momentum space representation for the gauge invariant mass has been obtained and applied to different situations , namely : massless and massive @xmath16 in @xmath1 dimensions , the @xmath1 dimensional square lattice and @xmath4 at finite temperature .",
    "the key ingredient for this representation is the validity of gauge invariance expressed by the ward identity , and of course its consistency with the dynamics defined by the schwinger - dyson equations",
    ".    it should be clear from ( [ eq : mg2 ] ) that the value of @xmath56 depends entirely on the infrared behavior of the fermion propagator , resulting indeed from the infrared dynamics .",
    "in particular , the momentum representation for the gauge invariant mass in @xmath1 dimensions turns out to be related to the chiral anomaly .",
    "this relationship suggests that @xmath0 should possess some kind of stability against perturbations .",
    "for instance , the introduction of a current - current interaction amounts to a smooth change  @xcite of the coefficient @xmath168 in equation ( [ eq : mg12 ] ) , while preserving the vanishing of @xmath169 .",
    "this means that , apart from a normalization factor , @xmath56 is still finite and non - vanishing .",
    "a further comment we would like to add , and which is related to the previous discussion is one concerning the meaning of formula ( [ eq : mg2 ] ) .",
    "the main difference between our momentum space representation for @xmath0 and similar representations  @xcite lies in the presence of the factor @xmath168 .",
    "this is related to the fact that in our case the formula can not be written just in terms of the su(2 ) projection of the fermion propagator as in the other cases .",
    "therefore , when including interactions @xmath0 is not protected from being renormalized . in this sense , the quantized gauge invariant mass of the @xmath1 dimensional schwinger model is not stable against interactions . in the present case ,",
    "what is stable against perturbations is the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath112 .",
    "if perturbations are included in the massive schwinger model or in the massless case , @xmath0 will however still be @xmath102 or @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "we finish with a comment and outlook on the possible implications of our results to higher dimensional systems at zero temperature , where dimensional reduction does not occur .",
    "it should be noted that the main difficulty is the fact that @xmath115 , as given by ( [ eq : mg2 ] ) , seems to be not interesting for the higher dimensional case , because of the ir behavior of the fermion propagators .",
    "one possible way out of this , could be to consider non - standard fields like , for instance , dipole fields .",
    "this , however , should require a re - derivation of the main results , since the structure of the model will , in principle , be different from the standard minimal coupling case .",
    "results on this will be reported elsewhere .",
