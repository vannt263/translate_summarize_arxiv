    "in 1901 darboux revisited @xcite the problem of mechanics considered originally by bertrand @xcite in 1857 ( for a russian translation of the 1901 darboux article refer to @xcite ) . later on the results of this investigation due to darboux",
    "were included almost verbatim in the classical text of whittaker on analytical mechanics @xcite . to this day",
    "darboux approach to the problem , which thus came to prominence with the classical whittaker s book , is widely used in the mathematical physics literature on integrable and superintegrable hamiltonian systems ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the idea used by darboux in @xcite to solve the bertrand - darboux problem was generalized to study hamiltonian systems defined in euclidean spaces of higher dimensions ( see @xcite and the relevant references therein ) . in this view , one can assert that the classical bertrand - darboux problem is `` that special case that contains all germs of generality '' ( in david hilbert s words ) .",
    "accordingly , the aim of this review article is to revisit the classical problem ( which was only partially solved by darboux , for a complete solution , using darboux approach , see @xcite ) once again and present a solution utilising the fundamental ideas of cartan s geometry ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the approach is based on both recent @xcite and classical @xcite results that incorporate cartan s geometry , in particular , - the method of moving frames @xcite , - into the study of classical hamiltonian systems , including the bertrand - darboux problem that concerns classical hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom defined in the euclidean plane .    more specifically , we target to compare , using modern notations and language , the two approaches to the problem originally considered by bertrand and darboux , namely darboux approach and the approach via cartan s geometry .",
    "this will enable us to conclude that cartan s geometry is the most general setting for solving the bertrand - darboux problem and its generalizations .",
    "an adequate presentation of the bertrand - darboux problem should begin with a brief review of liouville s paper of 1846 @xcite to which its origins can actually be traced .",
    "recall that liouville in @xcite studied canonical hamilton s equations governing the motion of a particle on a curved surface defined by a metric in isothermal coordinates under the influence of a potential energy depending on coordinates only .",
    "he observed that if the metric and the potential of the corresponding hamiltonian function ( total energy ) admitted special separable forms @xmath0 in some system of coordinates @xmath1 , the hamiltonian system defined by ( [ h1 ] ) could be solved by quadratures . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are some arbitrary smooth functions . throughout this paper",
    "the configuration space of the hamiltonian systems in question is a two - dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath4 ( the pseudo - riemannian case can be treated similarly @xcite ) , and the phase space is the cotangent bundle @xmath5 . note that the metric of the kinetic part of ( [ h1 ] ) assumes the following covariant form @xmath6 the form ( [ h1 ] ) of the hamiltonian function also implies additive separation of variables for the associated hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the metric ( [ lm ] ) and potential of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) are said to be in the _ liouville forms_. the converse problem was considered in 1881 by morera @xcite who showed that if a hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom defined by a natural hamiltonian @xmath7 could be solved within the framework of the hamilton - jacobi theory of separation of variables , then its metric @xmath8 with the components @xmath9 @xmath10 and the potential @xmath11 assumed the liouville forms with respect to special separable coordinates @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath13 are the standard physical position - momenta coordinates .",
    "we note that this conclusion does not exclude the possibility that the hamiltonian system defined by ( [ h2 ] ) separates in some other system of coordinates with respect to which the metric @xmath8 and the potential @xmath11 are not in the liouville forms .",
    "morera has also demonstrated that in the euclidean plane @xmath14 separation of variables for the hamiltnonian ( [ h1 ] ) in the liouville form occurs in cartesian , polar , parabolic and elliptic - hyperbolic coordinates .",
    "the equivalence established by morera appears to be incomplete , since it is not clear where the separable coordinates @xmath1 are to be derived from .",
    "the answer to this question , at least partial , was given by bertrand and darboux @xcite .",
    "recall that bertrand considered hamiltonian systems given by the natural hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) and admitting an additional first integral satisfying certain conditions .",
    "in this view he considered the governing equations describing the motion of a particle in the euclidean plane @xmath14 under the influence of the potential force defined by a function @xmath11 dependent on the position coordinates @xmath15 .",
    "thus , he assumed that the hamiltonian system defined by ( [ h2 ] ) admitted a first integral of motion of the form @xmath16 and then looked for the potential function @xmath11 in ( [ h2 ] ) satisfying this condition .",
    "bertrand considers the case of @xmath17 and then shows that the vanishing of the poisson bracket @xmath18 yields two further conditions , namely the _ killing tensor equation _",
    "@xmath19 = 0,\\ ] ] and the _ compatibility condition _",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 $ ] denote the schouten bracket @xcite , the @xmath23-tensor @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 .",
    "_ in what follows we shall always assume @xmath17 in ( [ fi ] ) . _",
    "the killing tensor equation ( [ kt ] ) puts in evidence that the functions @xmath26 in ( [ fi ] ) are the components of a killing tensor of valence two defined in the euclidean plane @xmath14 .",
    "more specifically , solving the killing tensor equation ( [ kt ] ) with respect to the standard cartesian coordinates of the eulidean metric @xmath27 yields the following general form @xmath28 & & + \\displaystyle ( \\beta_3 - \\beta_4q_1 -   \\beta_5q_2 - \\beta_6q_1q_2)\\partial_1\\odot \\partial_2 \\\\ [ 0.3 cm ] & & + \\displaystyle ( \\beta_2 + 2\\beta_5q_1+\\beta_6q_1 ^ 2 ) \\partial_2\\odot \\partial_2 , \\end{array } \\label{gkt}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the symmetric tensor product , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the arbitrary constants @xmath32 are the constants of integration . in local coordinates the killing tensor equation ( [ kt ] ) is an overdetermined system of pdes and the formula ( [ gkt ] ) demonstrates that the vector space of its solutions @xmath33 is six - dimensional : @xmath34 .",
    "bertrand next turns his attention to the compatibility condition ( [ cc ] ) . in terms of",
    "the cartesian coordinates @xmath35 it assumes the following form : @xmath36 \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial^2",
    "v}{\\partial q_1\\partial q_2}(\\beta_6q^2_2 - \\beta_6q^2_1 + 2\\beta_4q_2 - 2\\beta_5q_1 + \\beta_1-\\beta_2 ) + \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\displaystyle 3\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial q_1}(\\beta_6 q_2 + \\beta_4 ) + 3\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial q_2}(\\beta_6q_1 + \\beta_5 ) = 0 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the linear pde of second order ( [ bde ] ) was later called the _ bertrand - darboux pde_. solving ( [ bde ] ) for @xmath11 amounts to finding admissible potentials of the hamiltonian systems defined by ( [ h2 ] ) whose integrability is afforded by the existence of first integrals ( [ fi ] ) which are quadratic in the momenta .",
    "bertrand restricted his attention to the solutions having the form @xmath37,\\ ] ] thus recovering known results due to euler and and lagrange about the motion of a particle attracted by two fixed centres according to newton s law .",
    "the main goal of the 1901 paper due to darboux @xcite was to show that the linear pde ( [ bde ] ) could be solved in `` full generality '' , thus yielding a general potential @xmath38 of the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) that was compatible with the first integral ( [ fi ] ) . before solving the pde ( [ bde ] ) , darboux ingeniously observes that it can be simplified without loss of generality . indeed , by rotating and translating the axes one can simplify the general form of ( [ gkt ] ) , thus bringing it to a certain _ canonical _ form .",
    "note that this coordinate transformation has no effect on the dynamics of the system .",
    "in addition , darboux excludes the case when @xmath39 , taking @xmath40 and also assumes that the killing tensor after rotating and translating the axes assumes the following canonical form : @xmath41 note , that the coordinates @xmath42 and the parameters @xmath43 in ( [ ck ] ) are not the same as the corresponding coordinates and parameters in ( [ gkt ] ) .",
    "they are connected via the action of the isometry group ( see ( [ a1 ] ) below ) that consists of rotations and translations of the underlying space @xmath14 .",
    "the canonical form of the killing tensor ( [ ck ] ) can be simplified further .",
    "indeed , one can introduce the following killing tensor , given by @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is given by ( [ ck ] ) and @xmath8 denotes the contravariant metric of the euclidean plane @xmath14 given in terms of the cartesian coordinates @xmath47 ( [ em ] ) .",
    "indeed , in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath48 ( [ h2 ] ) and the first integral @xmath49 ( [ fi ] ) determined by the canonical killing tensor ( [ ck ] ) this is equivalent to introducing the first integral @xmath50 which is quadratic in the momenta and given by @xmath51 .",
    "now the difference @xmath52 can be treated as the only parameter entering the formula ( [ cck ] ) . moreover , without loss of generality , one can always assume @xmath53 .    in what follows , darboux proceeds to find the unknown @xmath38 by solving the pde ( [ cc ] ) determined by the canonical killing tensor ( [ ck ] ) , using the method of characteristics .",
    "eventually he introduces special coordinates @xmath1 with respect to which the pde ( [ cc ] ) is easily solved , yielding the general form of the potential @xmath38 in terms of @xmath1 : @xmath54 one immediately recognizes that the potential @xmath38 ( [ v ] ) is in the liouville form ( [ h1 ] ) , so is the corresponding metric .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian system can be solved via separation of variables in the corresponding hamilton - jacobi equation . moreover ,",
    "the separable coordinates @xmath1 are the parameters of confocal conics related to the original cartesian coordinates @xmath35 as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath43 as in ( [ cck ] ) .",
    "more specifically , the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent two families of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas intersecting each other orthogonally . in this view",
    "these orthogonal coordinates are called _ elliptic - hyperbolic_. in view of the fact that they afford separation of variables in the corresponding hamilton - jacobi equation of the hamiltonian system ( [ h2 ] ) , we call them _ orthogonally - separable coordinates_. in conclusion to this brief review of the results due to darboux , we note that he essentially solved two problems :    * first , under certain assumptions he employed an appropriate transformation that consists of rotations and translations of the space @xmath14 to reduce a given killing tensor in the form ( [ gkt ] ) to its canonical form ( [ ck ] ) . note this transformation of @xmath14 iduces the corresponding transformation in the vector space of killing two - tensors @xmath33 ( see ( [ a2 ] ) below ) . * second , he diagonalized the resulting canonical killing tensor , thus producing the corresponding orthogonally - separable coordinates ( [ eh ] ) generated by two families of confocal conics .",
    "_ the metric @xmath8 and killing two - tensor @xmath46 that determine the hamiltonian @xmath48 ( [ h2 ] ) and first integral @xmath49 ( [ fi ] ) in terms of the orthogonally - separable coordinates @xmath1 are given by the following diagonal forms : @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "_    in what follows , we shall describe the above problems solved by darboux from the viewpoint of cartan s geometry , as well as consider the cases that he excluded from his considerations .",
    "the following example ( see @xcite , as well as the relevant references therein for more details ) presents an illustration of how darboux method can be employed to find orthogonally - separable coordinates @xmath1 for a hamiltonian system with two - degrees of freedom admitting a first integral of the form ( [ fi ] ) and thus solve it by quadratures as shown by liouville @xcite .",
    "[ exa1 ]    consider a hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom defined in @xmath14 by the following hamiltonian : @xmath63 & &   + 4 ( q_1 ^ 3 + q_1q_2 ^ 2 ) - 2(q_1 ^ 2 + q_2 ^ 2 ) .",

    "re - write ( [ m ] ) in terms of a new parameter @xmath82 to get @xmath83 observe that the characteristic curves of the pde are two families of confocal conics .",
    "therefore taking the parameters of the confocal hyperbolas and ellipses as coordinates , we have @xmath84^{1/2},\\ ] ] or @xmath85 our next step is to write the pde ( [ v1 ] ) in terms of new variables @xmath82 and @xmath86 to obtain : @xmath87 which has a general solution @xmath88 in the liouville form ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we transform back to the original coordinates @xmath89 and @xmath90 to find @xmath91 therefore the separable coordinates are of the _ shifted elliptic - hyperbolic type_. using these new coordinates , one can solve the corresponding hamilton - jacobi equation by separation of variables and ultimately solve the hamiltonian system in question by quadratures ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "as is well - known , the geometry of the aforementioned four coordinate systems that afford separation of variables in the hamilton - jacobi equation of a hamiltonian system defined by ( [ h2 ] ) in @xmath14 and admitting a first integral of motion ( [ fi ] ) is induced by the geometry of the corresponding killing two - tensor that determines ( [ fi ] ) .",
    "more specifically , the four coordinate systems , namely cartesian , parabolic , polar and elliptic - hyperbolic , are generated by the eigenvectors ( eigenvalues ) of the corresponding killing two - tensor .",
    "thus , in each case the two families of confocal conics are the integral curves of the eigenvectors . in this",
    "setting we exclude from our consideration the _ trivial _ killing tensors , which are the multiples of the metric @xmath8 and as such do not generate orthogonal coordinate systems .",
    "such killing tensors determine the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) and its multiples .",
    "each _ non - trivial _ killing tensor has ( almost everywhere ) distinct and real eigenvalues .",
    "another important feature ( known already to jacobi ) of the four systems of coordinates is that the cartesian , parabolic and polar coordinate systems are degeneracies of the elliptic - hyperbolic coordinate system .",
    "thus in the most general case a coordinate system generated by a non - trivial killing tensor has two focii ( i.e. , the points where the eigenvalues coincide ) .",
    "this is the case ( considered by darboux @xcite ) of the elliptic - hyperbolic coordinate system . when the distance between the focii is zero , one gets the polar coordinates .",
    "next , the case when one of the focii goes to infinity , corresponds to the parabolic coordinate system . finally , when both focii are at infinity , the coordinate system is cartesian .",
    "figure 1 depicts the four coordinate systems along with the corresponding coordinate transformations to the cartesian coordinates .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure 1 : families of confocal conics    we conclude therefore that darboux in his celebrated 1901 paper @xcite considered only the most general case , namely orthogonal separation of variables in the case of the elliptic - hyporbolic coordinate system , excluding any degeneracies .",
    "when taking into account all of the cases , including the degeneracies , one is confronted with an _ equivalence type problem _ , that is for a given hamiltonian system defined by ( [ h2 ] ) in @xmath14 , admitting a first integral quadratic in the momenta , the first step is to determine what type of the four coordinate systems the corresponding killing two - tensor generates .",
    "once it is done , the next step is to transform the killing tensor and its orthogonal coordinate system to a canonical form . as we have seen in example [ yp2 ] , on account of the existence of a non - trivial potential @xmath38 in ( [ h2 ] ) , the system of coordinates that afford separation of variables can be not in a _",
    "canonical _ form .",
    "thus the elliptic - hyperbolic system of coordinates that we have derived in example [ yp2 ] is shifted ( translated along the @xmath89-axis ) , that is affected by the action of the corresponding isometry group . mapping a given element of an equivalent class to the corresponding canonical form",
    "is done with the aid of the moving frames map .",
    "therefore we conclude that the most natural framework for solving the equivalence and canonical forms problems is cartan s geometry .",
    "this observation leads us to believe that the most general solution to the classical betrand - darboux problem can be given in the framework of cartan s geometry .",
    "this is the subject of considerations that follow .",
    "let @xmath92 denote the lie group of ( orientation - preserving ) isometries of @xmath14 .",
    "it is a semi - direct product of @xmath93 ( subgroup of orientation - preserving rotations ) and @xmath94 ( subgroup of translations ) .",

    "the action @xmath98 ( a general element of the six - dimentional vector space @xmath33 is given by the generic formula ( [ gkt ] ) ) is not transitive . solving the equivalence and",
    "canonical forms problem is this case is equivalent to analysing the orbits of the vector space @xmath33 under the action of @xmath92 .",
    "the discussion presented in section [ gkt ] suggests that there are four types of orbits generated by non - trivial killing tensors of the vector space @xmath33 .",
    "we shall exclude from further consideration the @xmath99-dimensional orbits generated by trivial elements of @xmath33 ( since they do not generate coordinate systems and as such have no relevance in hamiltonian mechanics ) .",
    "the orbit space @xmath100 has a rather complicated structure , since it contains @xmath99- , @xmath101- , @xmath102- and @xmath103-dimensional orbits ( see below ) .",
    "it has a local differential structure under the quotient topology .",
    "in addition , the projection @xmath104 is a smooth fibration .",
    "the right action @xmath98 is ( locally ) free .",
    "furthermore , for any point @xmath105 the corresponding orbit @xmath106 is an immersed submanifold in @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 is a principle @xmath92-bundle . for each orbit",
    "@xmath108 passing through a non - trivial element @xmath105 we can sonsider the bundle of orthonormal frames of eigenvectors ( eigenforms ) of the elements of @xmath108 .",
    "the isometry group acts transitively on the bundle of orthonormal frames of @xmath108 .",
    "thus , we can employ the underlying ideas of cartan s geometry , specifically - the _ moving frames method _ @xcite , - to solve the equivalence and canonical forms problem for the action @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath105 be a non - trivial covariant killing two - tensor @xmath46 .",

    "thus , as expected , in total we arrive at four formulas for @xmath180 corresponding to four differnt types of orbits of the orbit space @xmath100 @xcite : @xmath181 \\mbox{polar ( p ) } : &   { \\boldsymbol}{k}^p_c =   \\partial_v \\odot \\partial_v , \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\mbox{parabolic ( pb ) } : & \\displaystyle { \\boldsymbol}{k}^{pb}_c = \\frac{v^2\\partial_u\\odot \\partial_u - u^2\\partial_v\\odot \\partial_v}{u^2+v^2 } , \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\mbox{elliptic - hyperbolic ( eh ) } : & \\displaystyle   { \\boldsymbol}{k}^{eh}_c = \\frac{\\cos^2v\\partial_u\\odot\\partial_u + \\cosh^2u\\partial_v\\odot\\partial_v}{k^2(\\cosh^2u - \\cos^2v)}.   \\end{array}\\ ] ] accordingly , the metric ( [ mc ] ) that appears in the general formula for the canonical forms ( [ ktcf ] ) , in each of the four cases is given by @xmath182 \\mbox{polar ( p ) } : & \\displaystyle { \\boldsymbol}{g}^p = \\partial_u\\odot \\partial_u + \\frac{1}{u^2 } \\partial_v \\odot \\partial_v , \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\mbox{parabolic ( pb ) } : & \\displaystyle { \\boldsymbol}{g}^{pb } = \\frac{\\partial_u\\odot \\partial_u + \\partial_v\\odot \\partial_v}{u^2+v^2},\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\mbox{elliptic - hyperbolic ( eh ) } : & \\displaystyle   { \\boldsymbol}{g}^{eh } = \\frac{\\partial_u\\odot\\partial_u + \\partial_v\\odot\\partial_v}{k^2(\\cosh^2u - \\cos^2v)}.   \\end{array}\\ ] ] we next compare the metric ( [ em ] ) given in terms of the cartesian coordinates @xmath183 with the corresponding four metrics given by ( [ cm ] ) in terms of the coordinates @xmath1 and employ the method introduced recently in @xcite to derive in each case the transformations from the coordinates @xmath1 to the cartesian coordinates @xmath183 : @xmath184 \\mbox{polar ( p ) } : & q_1 = u\\cos v , \\quad   q_2 = u\\sin v,\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\mbox{parabolic ( pb ) } : & q_1 = 1/2(u^2 - v^2 ) , \\quad   q_2 = uv ,   \\\\[0.3 cm ]   \\mbox{elliptic - hyperbolic ( eh ) } : & q_1 = k\\cosh u \\cos v , \\ ,",
    "q_2 = k \\sinh u \\sin v.   \\end{array}\\ ] ] finally , we use the formulas ( [ tr ] ) to transform back to the cartesian coordiantes @xmath183 the canonical killing tensors given by ( [ ckt ] ) : @xmath185 \\mbox{polar ( p ) } : &   { \\boldsymbol}{k}^p_c & = & q_2 ^ 2\\partial_1\\odot\\partial_1 -q_1q_2\\partial_1\\odot\\partial_2 + q_1 ^ 1\\partial_2\\odot\\partial_2 , \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\mbox{parabolic ( pb ) } : & { \\boldsymbol}{k}^{pb}_c & = & q_2\\partial_1\\odot\\partial_2 - 2q_1\\partial_2\\odot \\partial_2 , \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\mbox{elliptic - hyperbolic ( eh ) } : &   { \\boldsymbol}{k}^{eh}_c & = & ( k^2 + q_2 ^ 2)\\partial_1\\odot \\partial_1 - q_1q_2\\partial_1\\odot\\partial_2 \\\\ [ 0.3 cm ] & & & + q_1 ^ 2\\partial_2\\odot \\partial_2 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] now , we can describe the canonical forms of the orbits of every type .",
    "for example , a general formula of the canonical forms of the orbits whose elements generate the elliptic - hyperbolic systems of coordiantes can be obtained by substituting into the formula ( [ ktcf ] ) the cooresponding expression for the canonical killing tensor @xmath186 given by ( [ ckt ] ) and the formula ( [ em ] ) for @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , in terms of the cartesian coordinates @xmath187 the canonical forms of the elliptic - hyperbolic orbits are given by the following family of killing tensors : @xmath188 where @xmath186 and @xmath8 are given by ( [ ckt ] ) and ( [ em ] ) respectively .",
    "we immediately see that , for example , the killing tensor ( [ cck ] ) belongs to the family ( [ ceh ] ) for @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 and as such represents a canonical form of the corresponding elliptic - hyperbolic orbit ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that as far as applications of these results to the study of hamiltonian systems are concerned , it suffices to study only the @xmath180 part of the formula ( [ ktcf ] ) .",
    "indeed , if the hamiltonian system defined by the hamiltonian @xmath48 ( [ h2 ] ) admits a first integral @xmath49 ( [ fi ] ) , then it also admits a first integral of the form @xmath192 @xmath193 and vice versa .    we have solved the canonical forms problem for the orbit space @xmath194 .",
    "more specifically , for each type of orbits we have derived the most general form of the canonical forms . however , as we have seen in example [ exa1 ] , in applications , such as the betrand - darboux problem , non - trivial killing tensors can appear not in their canonical forms ( unless , of course , @xmath195 in ( [ h2 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , one has to be able to solve the equivalence forms problem , namely for a given non - trivial killing tensor ( which may not be in its canonical form ! ) , find a way to determine _ invariantly _ what type of orbit it belongs to .",
    "when it is done , one has to develop a systematic way of transforming a given non - trivial killing tensor to its respective canonical form , as specified by the formula ( [ ktcf ] ) . to achieve these goals",
    ", we shall employ another version of the moving frames method that has been introduced and developed recently @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the idea is to identify the bundle of frames of eigenvectors of non - trivial killing two - tensors with the group action @xmath98 ( since the group acts transitively on the bundle of frames ) and then work in the group .",
    "we begin by determining the action of the lie group @xmath92 in the vector space @xmath33 given by a general element ( [ gkt ] ) .",
    "this action is induced by the action @xmath95 given by @xmath196 \\tilde{q}_2 = q_1\\sin p_3 + q_2\\cos p_3 + p_2 ,   \\end{array } \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the parameters of the isometry group @xmath92 .",
    "using ( [ a1 ] ) and the standard tensor transformation laws applied to the general killing tensor ( [ gkt ] ) , we arrive at the following formulas : @xmath199 the formulas ( [ a2 ] ) were first derived in @xcite and then independently rediscovered in @xcite .",
    "next , using the standard techniques of the lie group theory , we derive the infinitesimal action of the group @xmath92 in the vector space @xmath33 given by the following generators of its lie algebra @xcite : @xmath200 { \\boldsymbol}{v}_2 = \\displaystyle 2\\beta_4\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_1 } - \\beta_5\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_3 }   + \\beta_6\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_4 } ,   \\\\ [ 0.3 cm ] { \\boldsymbol}{v}_3 = \\displaystyle   -2\\beta_3\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_1 } - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_2}\\big ) + ( \\beta_1 - \\beta_2)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_3 } + \\beta_5\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_4 } - \\beta_4\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_5}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] it follows from the formulas ( [ gen2 ] ) that the dimension of the orbits , which is determined at each point by the number of linearly independent vector fields ( [ gen2 ] ) , varies from @xmath99 to @xmath103 .",
    "for example , when @xmath201 and @xmath202 the dimension of the orbits is obviously @xmath99 .    to solve the equivalence problem completely , we follow the approach introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "first , we choose a cross - section @xmath203 that intersects @xmath103-dimensional orbits transversally where the group action is free and regular : @xmath204 next , we observe that chosing a cross - section in this setting is equivalent to chosing a rigid moving frame in the previous considerations , where we employed a classical version of the moving frames method . moreover , the intersection points are precisely the canonical forms whose coordinates are given by _ invariants _ of the group action @xmath98 , that is the functions of the parameters @xmath205 that remain unchanged under the group action ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "next , we derive the _ moving frame map _",
    "@xmath206 for the _ normalization equations _ corresponding to the cross - section ( [ cs ] ) : @xmath207 indeed , solving ( [ ne ] ) for the group parameters @xmath208 and @xmath198 , we get @xcite @xmath209   p_2 & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{\\beta_4\\cos p_3 + \\beta_5\\sin p_3}{\\beta_6 } , \\\\ [ 0.3 cm ] p_3 & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan \\frac{2(\\beta_3\\beta_6 + \\beta_4\\beta_5)}{\\beta_6(\\beta_1-\\beta_2 ) - \\beta_4 ^ 2 + \\beta_5 ^ 2}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] note , the moving frame map @xmath206 given by ( [ mfm ] ) maps elements of the corresponding orbits to their respective canonical forms .",
    "we first observe from ( [ a2 ] ) that @xmath210 is an @xmath92-invariant of the vector space @xmath33 .",
    "substituting the expressions for @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath198 into the first two formulas in ( [ a2 ] ) , we arrive at two additional _ fundamental @xmath92-invariants _ : @xmath213   \\delta_3 & = & ( \\beta_6(\\beta_1 - \\beta_2 ) - \\beta_4 ^ 2 + \\beta_5 ^ 2)^2 + 4(\\beta_6 \\beta_3 + \\beta_4 \\beta_5)^2 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] recall that the fundamental invariants @xmath214 and @xmath215 were derived first in @xcite , and then rediscovered more systematically , using the method of infinitesimal generators , in @xcite ( see also @xcite for other methods ) .",
    "the fundamental invariants @xmath214 and @xmath215 can be used to distinquish between the orbits @xcite .",
    "the classification is as follows .",
    "@xmath216 \\mbox{polar ( p ) } : & \\delta_1 \\not= 0 \\quad \\delta_3 = 0 ,    \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\mbox{parabolic ( pb ) } : & \\delta_1 = 0 \\quad \\delta_3 \\not=0 ,   \\\\[0.3 cm ]   \\mbox{elliptic - hyperbolic ( eh ) } : &   \\delta_1 \\not= 0 , \\quad \\delta_3 \\not= 0 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the fundamental invariants @xmath214 and @xmath215 in the case when both of them are not zero , have an interesting geometric meaning .",
    "the distance @xmath217 between the focii of an elliptic - hyperbolic system of coordinates generated by a non - trivial killing tensor , is clearly an @xmath92-invariant .",
    "hence @xmath217 is a function of the fundamenal invariants found above .",
    "the corresponding formula was found in @xcite to be @xmath218 given a non - trivial killing tensor @xmath219 , we compare it with the general form ( [ gkt ] ) , obtain the values for the corresponding parameters @xmath205 and then compute the funamental @xmath92-invariants @xmath214 and @xmath215 . the problem of the determination of the orbit type for @xmath46 , using the classification ( [ cl ] ) , is then straightforward .",
    "if @xmath46 generate an elliptic - hyperbolic coordinate system , then we compute the corresponding moving frame map ( [ mfm ] ) , find the group parameters @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath198 , and then subsitutte them into the formulas for the group action ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting transformation maps @xmath46 to its canonical form .",
    "dealing with the remaining three cases , namely cartesian , polar and parabolic , is a delicate matter .",
    "the group action @xmath98 is not regular globally .",
    "thus , for example , the vanishing @xmath220 indicates that the dimension of the orbits drops from three to two . if , in addition , @xmath221 the dimension of the orbits drops further to one . on the other hand , comparing the expressions for the generators of the lie algebra of the isometry group @xmath92 ( [ gen2 ] ) with the formulas for the canonical forms ( [ ckt ] ) ,",
    "we conclude that the cartesian orbits are @xmath101-dimensional , polar - @xmath102-dimensional and the orbits of the parabolic and elliptic - hyperbolic types are @xmath103-dimensional .",
    "clearly , in order to derive moving frame maps for the @xmath101-dimensional and @xmath102-dimensional and @xmath103-dimensional orbits , other than the elliptic - hyperbolic type , one has to choose different cross - sections ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we will solve the same problem considered in example [ exa1 ] , using the results obtained in this section .",
    "[ 2nd integrable case of yatsun ] [ exa2 ] this time we will not find the solution by solving the betrand - darboux pde ( [ bde ] ) for the potential @xmath38 . instead we will deal with the killing tensor ( [ ky ] ) only .",
    "the material presented in section [ cg ] suggests that once the killing tensor of ( [ fi ] ) is available , solving the bertrand - darboux pde ( [ bde ] ) for @xmath38 is _",
    "redundant_. indeed , now we compare the killing tensor ( [ ky ] ) with the general form ( [ gkt ] ) to obtain @xmath222 substituting this data into the formulas for @xmath214 ( [ i1 ] ) and @xmath215 ( [ i23 ] ) , we obtain @xmath223 which immediately shows that the killing tensor ( [ ky ] ) generates the elliptic - hyperbolic coordinates . moreover , by ( [ focii ] ) the distance between the focii @xmath224 .",
    "next , we compute the moving frames map ( [ mfm ] ) : @xmath225 taking into account the formulas ( [ a1 ] ) ( @xmath226 ) and ( [ tr ] ) ( for ( eh ) ) , we conclude that the transformation to separable coordinates is given by ( [ ct ] ) as expected .",
    "thus , we have solved the same problem as in example [ exa1 ] _ without solving the bertrand - darboux pde ( [ bde ] ) !",
    "_ moreover , the procedure based on the moving frame method is purely algorithmical and so it can be implemented in a computer algebra package @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented above ( compare examples [ exa1 ] and [ exa2 ] ) demonstrates that the bertrand - darboux problem ( and its generalizations @xcite ) can be solved within the framework of cartan s geometry , in particular - its most important asset - the moving frames method .",
    "moreover , the approach , based on the method of moving frames , is algorithmical , independent of the curvature or signature of the underlying pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath4 , easily adaptable to different geometric settings .",
