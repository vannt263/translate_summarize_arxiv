    "although inflation  @xcite is considered to be able to solve many cosmological problems while providing the desirable initial conditions for the hot big bang universe , the practical implementation of an inflationary scenario consistently in the context of high energy theory and phenomenology is still unclear  @xcite .",
    "one of the most profound difficulties is the realisation of the simple chaotic inflation with power law potential  @xcite , which fits best with most recent cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "this simplest possibility typically requires an initial value of the inflaton field far beyond the planck scale @xmath1 .",
    "this super - planckian initial value exposes any explicit model of chaotic inflation to uncontrollable radiative corrections and the inflationary predictions become not reliable .",
    "fortunately , this problem can be evaded in multi - field inflation models , since the hubble parameter @xmath2 receives contributions from all the fields participating in inflation  @xcite .",
    "thus even with sub - planckian field values which for the single field case will not give rise to enough number of @xmath0-folds @xmath3 , the duration of inflation can be long enough to achieve all the major successes we expect well under the theoretical control .",
    "moreover , there exist plenty of scalar fields in theories beyond the standard model of particle physics such as supersymmetry and supergravity  @xcite .",
    "hence any inflationary model based on such a theory would naturally incorporate multiple number of fields .    at this point ,",
    "the existence of the coupled terms between the inflaton fields is of great importance for the inflationary dynamics . in the single field case ,",
    "the interactions with most non - inflaton fields are usually required to be very small to maintain the sufficiently flat inflaton potential . in multi - field models , however , virtually all the light scalar fields may contribute and there is no reason to suppress the coupled terms a priori . also , any phenomenological constraint for the interaction from such a consideration should place an useful , important bound on the parameters of the underlying theory .",
    "this is what we would like to study in the present note : we will address this issue using a rudimentary model of multi - field inflation , introducing a simple cross term which couples the inflaton fields .",
    "the potential may arise in the context of string theory by breaking the shift symmetry , and the interaction terms appear with their magnitude being suppressed by the ultra violet cutoff scale , i.e. the string scale @xmath4 .",
    "a simple analysis on the inflationary dynamics can place a bound on this scale .",
    "for clarity , we first concentrate on the simplest case of the two - field chaotic inflation  @xcite with the potential @xmath5 and now we include an interaction term @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the coupling between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in addition , we take @xmath10 larger than @xmath11 and assume that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not too different : if the difference is too large , the inflationary phase is completely dominated by @xmath8 and virtually @xmath9 is decoupled from the dynamics , although after inflation it may serve as a curvaton candidate  @xcite , adding additional constraints on e.g. the energy scale of inflation  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ num ] , we present several numerical results . as can be seen , when the interaction term eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) dominates , the total number of @xmath0-folds is reduced almost by half .",
    "more importantly , when the coupling is strong @xmath8 and @xmath9 tend to follow the same evolution , i.e. in the field space the trajectory is directly towards the minimum at the origin . also note that for @xmath12 , @xmath3 hardly changes .",
    "we can understand the evolution of @xmath8 and @xmath9 as follows .",
    "given the potential eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) with the interaction term eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) , the equations of motion of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are written as @xmath13 respectively , where the hubble parameter @xmath2 during inflation is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) and ( [ interaction ] ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ eomphi ] ) and ( [ eomchi ] ) , we can see that the `` effective '' masses are composed of the bare masses and the interaction , i.e. @xmath16 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "thus two different effects are competing , and the dynamics is determined by the term which is important : if the bare masses dominate , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are practically decoupled and it is well known that the total number of @xmath0-folds @xmath3 , neglecting @xmath17 corrections , is given by  @xcite @xmath18 conversely , when the interaction is strong enough , this prediction becomes different : the equations of motion , especially at the early stage of inflation , are simplified to , with the replacement @xmath19 , @xmath20 i.e. the equation becomes that of the quartic potential and both @xmath8 and @xmath9 essentially follow the same evolution . in this case , @xmath3 is given by @xmath21 and is reduced by half compared with the case where the bare masses are dominating , which is clear from fig .",
    "this is also why the coupling larger than a specific value does not alter @xmath3 appreciably : this value corresponds to what makes the interaction term larger than the bare mass contribution .",
    "the case of intermediate interacting energy should be of most interest .",
    "since the slow roll approximation is valid for most duration , we can write the equations of motion for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in terms of @xmath3 , as @xmath22 where we have used @xmath23 , a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath3 and the subscript @xmath24 stands for @xmath8 and @xmath9 . we can thus write the solution of eq .",
    "( [ sreom ] ) as @xmath25 where the slow - roll parameter @xmath26 is assumed to be nearly constant , which is a good enough approximation in the slow roll regime of inflation . since we are assuming that the energy associated with the heavier field , @xmath8 here , and the interaction energy are relatively large , the number of @xmath0-folds until @xmath8 contributes follows that of a quadratic potential of @xmath8 which is independent of the effective mass of @xmath8 given by eq .",
    "( [ mphieff ] ) , and is estimated simply as @xmath27 until then the lighter field , @xmath9 , evolves according to eq .",
    "( [ srsol ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath9 at the moment when @xmath8 exits inflationary regime , @xmath28 , is thus given by @xmath29 afterwards only @xmath9 drives inflation .",
    "hence the number of @xmath0-folds @xmath30 , achieved during this phase , is simply given by the standard result @xmath31 where we have assumed for simplicity that inflation ends when @xmath32 .",
    "the total number of @xmath0-folds is then , from eqs .",
    "( [ nphi ] ) and ( [ nchi ] ) , @xmath33 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for example , let us take the numbers from the upper right plot of fig .",
    "[ num ] . with the given numbers , roughly @xmath34 thus , from eq .",
    "( [ nphi ] ) , @xmath35 .",
    "meanwhile , using eq .",
    "( [ srepsilon ] ) , we can estimate @xmath36 where we have used our assumption that the potential energy of @xmath8 and the interaction energy are of the same order of magnitude and are very large compared with the potential energy of @xmath9 , as can be read from eq .",
    "( [ eorder ] ) . substituting eq .",
    "( [ epsilonchi ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ totaln ] ) , then we have @xmath37 which is in good agreement with the numerical estimate @xmath38 .",
    "also we note that both the bare masses and the coupling do not affect the duration of the inflationary epoch but they determine the amplitude of the power spectrum @xmath39 , see eqs .",
    "( [ pquadratic ] ) and ( [ pquartic ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ gdependence ] , we show the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath39 on the coupling @xmath7",
    ".    we can easily expand the argument to include arbitrary number of fields : there are total @xmath40 fields @xmath41 , each with the mass @xmath42 so that the leading piece is @xmath43 with the interaction between @xmath41 and @xmath44 @xmath45 being given by @xmath46 the potential is then written as @xmath47 then the equation of motion of @xmath41 is given by @xmath48 thus while the bare mass remains fixed , the number of interactions can become very large according to the total number of fields , making them completely dominating unless the couplings are all exceptionally small . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that all the masses and the coupling constants are the same , and write them as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . then with @xmath51 so that @xmath40 and @xmath52 are more or less the same , eq .  ( [ multieom ] ) is reduced to @xmath53 compared with eq .",
    "( [ 2fieldeomsimple ] ) , when the interactions are strong , @xmath50 should be suppressed by a factor of @xmath54 to maintain the same predictions .",
    "now we briefly mention perturbations .",
    "we may follow the @xmath55 formalism  @xcite , or the standard procedure for the single field case  @xcite , to calculate the observable quantities such as the power spectrum @xmath39 and the spectral index @xmath56 : if the masses are dominating , we have @xmath57 or when the interactions are important , @xmath58 when the masses or the couplings are different , typically we have a redder spectrum  @xcite . at this point",
    ", it is interesting to note that the results are confined between those of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 theories .",
    "this can be seen from the geometry of the field space : the interaction @xmath61 lifts the whole potential , with the steepest rise along the line @xmath62 which corresponds to the quartic potential , while leaves @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. the mass eigenstates , intact .",
    "thus in the field space the descent is mildest along each axis with quadratic dependence , and is steepest along @xmath65 with quartic dependence .",
    "thus at the early times the trajectory tends to be towards the origin along the steepest descent . this geometric consideration should be applicable to generic power law potential and interactions .",
    "also we should note that the shape of @xmath39 is saw - edged . with not equal masses ( or couplings in general ) heavier fields will drop out of the inflationary regime first . near the moment of a single drop out , we can expand the potential then a change of slope is experienced : with @xmath66 denoting the slope , when @xmath40-th field is relaxed to minimum and quits the inflationary regime , we have  @xcite @xmath67 where the right hand side is evaluated at the moment of the drop out .",
    "this will lead to an enhancement of @xmath39 across the corresponding scale , which becomes mild when the masses are densely spaced . in fig .",
    "[ phaseplot ] we plot the phase portrait of @xmath9 of fig .",
    "[ num ] , from which this momentary feature can be read .",
    "it is also noticeable that with strong enough interactions , the level of non - gaussianity in general will not be significant .",
    "@xmath68 during inflation is known to become large when the trajectory in the field space is highly non - trivial  @xcite .",
    "for the case where the interaction terms are dominating , however , all the fields evolve essentially in the same , or at least similar way , making the trajectory in the field space varying very smoothly .",
    "this will lead to mild , even negligible enhancement of @xmath68 .",
    "although it should be possible to obtain considerable non - gaussianity with a very special choice of the initial conditions , but this looks not quite likely .    finally , we mention the possibility of parametric resonance due to the oscillation of a field near its minimum . in the theory of preheating  @xcite ,",
    "the strength of parametric resonance is determined by the parameter @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the amplitude of oscillation of the inflaton @xmath8 when the inflationary phase ends .",
    "only when @xmath71 , the field coupled to @xmath8 , say @xmath9 , goes through many instability bands of the mathieu equation and the resonance becomes prominent . in the present case , however , because of the relatively large hubble parameter , the energy of the massive fields which would oscillate earlier in the absence of other light fields is dissipated and those fields are overdamped , showing negligible oscillation .",
    "even for the light fields which oscillate later , it is known that the amplitude near the end of inflation is suppressed by a factor proportional to @xmath54  @xcite , making the amplitudes of oscillation far smaller than that of the single field case .",
    "hence we have small @xmath72 and the resonance is suppressed . if we increase @xmath7 to make @xmath72 large , as discussed before all the fields follow the same evolution and oscillate in phase , heavily suppressing the possibility of parametric resonance theory , which is equivalent to the present situation  @xcite .",
    "however pursuing this idea is beyond the scope of the present paper , and we do not discuss it here . ] .",
    "we have tried different parameter ranges but have not found any instability of @xmath9 .",
    "this seems to suggest that we need fine tunings to observe any parametric resonance .",
    "now we turn to our next point how the discussion in the previous section may put a bound on the string scale @xmath4 .",
    "it was argued  @xcite that in string theory the ubiquitous string axion fields can give rise to the uncoupled quadratic potential , eq .",
    "( [ generalv ] ) , as the leading approximation , provided that the fields are displaced not too far from their minima . the potential is a sum of the axion contributions .",
    "thus we do not consider these contributions .",
    "but even if we take them into account , still the argument here is applicable .",
    "] , @xmath73 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the axion potential scale and @xmath75 is the axion decay constant .",
    "multi - instanton corrections generate the coupling terms between the axions , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the cutoff scale of the theory , which in string theory should correspond to the string scale @xmath4 . typically @xmath74 is smaller than @xmath78 by many orders of magnitude thus provided that @xmath79 eq .",
    "( [ axionvcorrection ] ) is highly suppressed and can be ignored so that eq .",
    "( [ generalv ] ) is a good enough approximation of eq .",
    "( [ axionv ] ) .    for small field values , we can expand eq .",
    "( [ axionv ] ) and easily find that @xmath80 and from eqs .",
    "( [ generalinteraction ] ) and ( [ axionvcorrection ] ) , @xmath81 moreover , it is known  @xcite that in string theory @xmath75 is likely to lie within @xmath82 so that any field value beyond @xmath78 seems prohibited . but nevertheless as mentioned in the previous section with a large number of fields it is possible to have the simplest chaotic inflation with quadratic potential as eq .",
    "( [ generalv ] ) , which is favoured by recent cosmological observations .",
    "the important point is that , still the predictions generally follow those of the single field model , so that for example the overall mass scale is constrained to be @xmath83 from the observed amplitude of density perturbations  @xcite .",
    "this in turn can put a reasonable bound on the string scale @xmath4 .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that all the masses and the couplings are the same and that all the axion decay constants are set to be @xmath78 .",
    "the observed density perturbations require eq .",
    "( [ massconst ] ) , thus using eq .",
    "( [ massapprox ] ) we have @xmath84 so that the axion scale is @xmath85 now , using eq .",
    "( [ couplingapprox ] ) , we can estimate @xmath86 thus an appropriate bound on the couplings can constrain the possible range of the string scale @xmath4 : for example , from fig .",
    "[ num ] let us take the bound @xmath87 for the couplings not to completely dominate the dynamics .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath88 thus , in this case the string scale smaller than the scale of grand unified theory @xmath89 would lead to comparably short period of inflation so that it may not solve the cosmological problems . in this context , @xmath4 as large as @xmath78 highly suppresses the couplings and is thus favoured .",
    "we can obtain the same estimate by comparing the magnitudes of eqs .",
    "( [ axionv ] ) and ( [ axionvcorrection ] ) as follows  @xcite . by assuming that all the @xmath74 and @xmath75 are of the same order of magnitude for simplicity , we have @xmath90 where we have used the fact that for a random distribution of @xmath91 between 0 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath94 increases proportional to @xmath95 since it is summed over two different indices .",
    "since we expect that inflation is driven dominantly by @xmath96 , which should be the energy scale of inflation , we can write @xmath97 that is , the inflationary energy scale is bounded from above by the cutoff energy scale of the underlying theory , which is quite reasonable . to reproduce the predictions of the chaotic inflation with quadratic potential , with the inflaton mass given by eq .",
    "( [ massconst ] ) , we have @xmath98 about 60 @xmath0-folds before the end of inflation .",
    "this again gives @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ msdependence ] , we show the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath39 on the string scale @xmath4 .",
    "an important point we can read from fig .  [ msdependence ] is that , the coupling @xmath7 _ can not _ be indefinitely small .",
    "this is because @xmath7 is inversely proportional to @xmath100 as eq .",
    "( [ couplingapprox ] ) and the current ultra violet cutoff scale is bounded by @xmath78 from above .",
    "we immediately face a difficulty regarding the amplitude of @xmath39 , which becomes unacceptably large as @xmath4 becomes even slightly less than @xmath78 provided that the masses are of the right magnitude which gives @xmath101 , i.e. eq .  ( [ massconst ] ) . in this case , as can be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ msdependence ] , even the largest conceivable string scale @xmath102 is only marginally acceptable .",
    "this estimate is , however , completely changed if we allow a post - inflationary generation of perturbations such as the curvaton mechanism  @xcite .",
    "( [ massconst ] ) assumes the simplest possibility that no curvature perturbation is generated during the post - inflationary dynamics and that all the observed inhomogeneities in the universe are purely due to the fluctuations of the inflaton fields .",
    "if we do not require this standard lore we can liberate @xmath103 from the constraint eq .",
    "( [ massconst ] ) and it can be reduced by large orders of magnitude . from eq .",
    "( [ couplingapprox ] ) this gives rise to a large allowed range of @xmath4 . in that sense ,",
    "a post - inflationary generation of perturbation is not just an option , but is rather _ strongly favoured _ in the light of richer string phenomenology which is due to considerably smaller @xmath4 than @xmath78 .",
    "if additional curvature perturbation is generated via the curvaton mechanism , it is required  @xcite that during inflation @xmath104 , or equivalently , @xmath105 so that we are allowed have an intermediate inflationary energy scale of @xmath106 .",
    "( [ massconst ] ) then can be lowered as much as @xmath107 then , from eq .",
    "( [ couplingapprox ] ) , @xmath108 which now allows @xmath4 much lower than @xmath89 .",
    "this is perfectly compatible with phenomenologically interesting intermediate string scales of @xmath109 , which may naturally arise in specific string compactifications such as large volume compactification  @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ massapprox ] ) this is reduced to the problem of constructing very large @xmath75 , which is still unclear in the context of string theory  @xcite , although there exist some possibilities  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of multi - field inflation in the presence of the interactions between the inflaton fields . in single field models the inflaton field",
    "is required to be coupled very weakly to other fields to maintain the flatness of its potential , otherwise the successful predictions of the slow - roll conditions which are consistent with the most recent observations are apt to get spoiled . in multi - field models , in general all the light scalar fields contribute to the inflationary epoch and there should exist coupled terms between the inflaton fields , which presumably have profound effects on the inflationary dynamics . as the simplest possibility we have taken the multi - field chaotic inflation model as the example with quadratic coupling terms between the inflaton fields . as shown in fig .",
    "[ num ] , the first observation is that the total number of @xmath0-folds @xmath3 can be considerably reduced .",
    "this happens when the coupled terms dominate over the bare masses , since the quadratic couplings act as the quartic potential in the equations of motion of each inflaton field .",
    "we can follow the same reasoning for any general power law potential and interactions , and the observable quantities such as the power spectrum @xmath39 and the spectral index @xmath56 vary between the predictions of the theory with the lowest power and those of the highest power of the potential .",
    "this consideration can place a bound on the characteristic scale of the underlying physics such as the string scale @xmath110 for string theory .",
    "we have considered the case where the ubiquitous string axion fields can play the role of the multiple inflaton fields . with the assumption that they are displaced not too far from the minimum",
    "they can reproduce the uncoupled quadratic potential , eq .",
    "( [ generalv ] ) , as the leading approximation , but via multi - instanton corrections different axion fields are coupled as eq .",
    "( [ axionvcorrection ] ) .",
    "these coupled terms are suppressed by the string scale , thus the strength of the coupled terms is dependent on the magnitude of the string scale .",
    "hence from the requirement that the interactions be not too strong to hinder a long enough period of inflation , we can place an interesting bound on the string scale .",
    "we have considered here the simplest quadratic potential , and in this case a large @xmath4 of at least @xmath111 is preferred . but allowing post - inflationary generation of perturbation can give much more relaxed constraint .",

    "i thank the anonymous referee as well for keen criticisms on the earlier manuscripts .",
