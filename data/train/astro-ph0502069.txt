    "a host of recent cosmological observations , the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite , the large scale structures of the universe  @xcite and type ia supernovae  @xcite , indicate that the universe has experienced two stages of cosmic acceleration .",
    "the first one is the inflationary era which occurred in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "it is responsible for the almost flatness of the universe and primordial density fluctuations  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "the second one , which started in the recent past , leads to the present acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "various explanations for this last phenomenon have been proposed in the literature : a pure cosmological constant  @xcite , quintessence  @xcite , k - essence  @xcite , modified gravity theories  @xcite , the chaplygin gas  @xcite , bulk viscosity  @xcite or quantum cosmological effects  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the quintessence hypothesis . in this case , the two phenomena described above are modeled as resulting from the presence of two scalar fields whose energy densities drive the acceleration of the expansion .",
    "the quintessence hypothesis has been further investigated in refs .",
    "in particular , finding a natural candidate for the quintessence field in the realm of high energy physics has been a major goal for lot of authors  @xcite as well as studying some aspects of its interaction with the `` rest of the world ''  @xcite . since",
    ", contrary to a cosmological constant , the quintessence field can develop some inhomogeneities , the theory of cosmological perturbations has also been studied in details  @xcite and has been used in order to constraint various models observationally  @xcite .",
    "of course , the prospect of utilizing the fact that the quintessence equation of state is no longer time ( or redshift)-independent as a tool for discriminating amongst the various possibilities has been widely discussed in the recent literature  @xcite .    as a low energy description of string theory  @xcite",
    ", supergravity captures prominent features of physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "supergravity is the best framework within which both quintessence and inflation can be described . indeed",
    "inflation ( in its most common models like chaotic inflation ) involves high energies as the inflaton rolls down its potential with values exceeding the planck mass .",
    "similarly , in quintessence models with a rolling scalar , the quintessence field reaches values of the order of the planck mass now . hence the necessity for a treatment where non - renormalizable interaction terms suppressed by the planck mass are under control . in supergravity ,",
    "such non - renormalizable corrections to supersymmetric models are taken into account and play an important role .",
    "this justifies the use of supergravity models both in inflation and quintessence model building . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on both quintessence and inflation as described in supergravity .",
    "one of the commonly used models of quintessence , first devised by ratra and peebles  @xcite , requires an inverse power law behavior @xmath2 with an attractor mechanism at large time .",
    "it was soon realized that this type of potential can be generated in supersymmetric theories when a strongly interacting sector is present  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the value of the quintessence field becomes of the order of the planck scale which prompts the necessity of a supergravity treatment .",
    "a simple embedding of the previous model in supergravity fails as the potential is highly modified by supergravity corrections and can become negative  @xcite .",
    "hence a more phenomenological approach may be required where one postulates the form of the khler potential and the superpotential which leads to quintessence in supergravity .",
    "this was done in refs .",
    "@xcite and subsequent work .    similarly , as a high energy phenomenon occurring in the early universe",
    ", inflation must be described within supergravity .",
    "recently , there has been a upsurge of inflation models in supergravity motivated by string theory  @xcite .",
    "it seems natural to study the influence of quintessence on inflation and vice versa .",
    "quintessence must be almost decoupled from ordinary matter , otherwise the quintessence field would lead to observable fifth force signals  @xcite . on the contrary",
    "the inflaton field must couple quite strongly to ordinary matter in order to have a reheating period at the end of inflation where the oscillations of the inflaton result in a radiation bath .",
    "hence the coupling of quintessence and inflaton can not be large . a natural way of realizing this criterion is to consider that the inflaton and the quintessence field are decoupled in the khler potential and the superpotential of supergravity .",
    "this implies that the only possible interactions between both fields spring from non - renormalizable interactions suppressed by the planck mass . here",
    "we provide such a supergravity description of the coupling between inflation and quintessence .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in a first part ( sec .",
    "ii ) , we analyze the supergravity coupling between a particular quintessence model , the so - called sugra model  @xcite , and a generic inflationary model . we then ( sec .",
    "iii ) apply this analysis to the specific example of chaotic inflation where we show that the quintessence field develops a potential with a rolling minimum during inflation .",
    "the rolling minimum is an attractor such that the values of the quintessence field remain small throughout the inflationary era . in particular , these values are much smaller than the values of a free quintessence field during inflation .",
    "the smallness of the quintessence field during inflation implies that it is on tracks now , i.e. it reaches its long time attractor . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the limitations of our approach , try to indicate what possible improvements could be and present our conclusions .",
    "let us now briefly review a simple model of quintessence in supergravity often dubbed the sugra model in the literature .",
    "we assume that the khler potential and the superpotential are given by  @xcite @xmath3 with @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are two charged fields under an ( anomalous ) @xmath7 symmetry with charges @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while @xmath1 is the neutral quintessence field .",
    "notice the direct coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "the constant @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling constant and @xmath11 is a free coefficient .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one can derive the sugra model from more general khler potentials but we will not need them in this article , see ref .  @xcite . at this stage , we assume that @xmath12 as a specific example , @xmath13 can be realized as a fayet - iloupoulous term arising from the green  schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism . when @xmath14 , the @xmath1 direction is flat .",
    "it is lifted by the superpotential leading to the quintessence potential . in supergravity , negative contributions to the scalar potential arise from the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the superpotential .",
    "notice that we have here @xmath15 implying that no negative contribution appears in the scalar potential .",
    "we are now in a position where the scalar potential can be computed . in supergravity , it is given by @xmath16 where the matrix @xmath17 which is used to raise and lower the index @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the fields in the quintessence sector .",
    "straightforward calculations leads to a matrix which is block  diagonal , namely @xmath21\\ , .\\ ] ] then the complete sugra potential becomes @xmath22 where the mass scale @xmath23 characterizing the potential can be expressed as @xmath24 .",
    "it is easy to find that @xmath25 which means that the real part field @xmath1 is in fact not correctly normalized .",
    "therefore , one has to redefine the field @xmath1 according to @xmath26 and this gives @xmath27 where we have slightly redefined the mass scale @xmath23 such that @xmath28 .",
    "the main feature of the above potential is that supergravity corrections have been exponentiated and appear in the prefactor .",
    "phenomenologically , this potential has the nice feature that the equation of state @xmath29 can be closer to @xmath30 than with the ratra ",
    "peebles potential .",
    "let us now give a brief description of the inflation models we will concentrate on .",
    "we will consider a class of models described by the following khler potential @xmath31 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\cal g}\\left(\\phi-\\phi^\\dagger\\right)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the field @xmath34 is the inflaton while @xmath35 represents , for instance , a moduli of a string compactification .",
    "the superpotential @xmath36 is not specified at this stage .",
    "this form is justified by the fact that one can obtain flat enough potentials in supergravity by requiring that a shift symmetry @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a real constant , is a symmetry of the khler potential , later broken mildly . the khler potential given by eq .",
    "( [ kahlerinf ] ) obviously possesses this symmetry .",
    "indeed , a striking feature of f - term inflation in supergravity is the natural presence of @xmath39 corrections to the inflaton mass which would spoil the flatness of the potential .",
    "these problems can be avoided by considering the above class of models .",
    "to go further , one must specify the functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the superpotential .",
    "we choose an example of chaotic inflation as can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where a similar case is treated .",
    "explicitly , one assumes @xmath40 and for the superpotential @xmath41 the factor @xmath42 in the superpotential is free and can be chosen for future convenience .",
    "notice that the shift symmetry is preserved by our choice of the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 while , on the contrary , the superpotential breaks this symmetry explicitly .",
    "then , straightforward calculations lead to @xmath43 where @xmath44 . it is easy to see that the moduli can be stabilized if @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , one can check that the normalization of the inflaton is given by @xmath46 and , hence , is correct . in this case",
    ", the potential takes the form @xmath47 which is nothing but the usual chaotic inflation potential if one chooses @xmath48 .    of course , it is possible to discuss more complicated and/or general inflationary models .",
    "the one considered here has the advantage to lead to the prototypical single field inflationary model , namely chaotic inflation . since our main goal is not to study inflation itself but",
    "the coupling of the inflaton with the quintessence field , this model is sufficient .",
    "however , it is clear that the next step would be to study how the form of the coupling term that we are going to derive below depends on the assumed inflationary model .",
    "we now turn to our main goal , namely the calculation of the coupling between the inflaton field and the quintessence field .",
    "our basic assumption is that the quintessence and inflation sectors are decoupled , _",
    "i.e. _ that the total khler potential and superpotential can be written as @xmath49 where the quintessential khler potential and superpotential have been given before but where , at least at this stage , the inflationary part is still arbitrary .",
    "however , later , we will restrict our considerations to the ( chaotic ) inflation model studied in the preceding section . from the above equations ,",
    "one deduces that the matrix @xmath17 , where now @xmath50 , is diagonal by blocks .",
    "explicitly , one has @xmath51\\ , .\\ ] ] then , the scalar potential takes the form ( recall that the d - terms contribution vanishes )    @xmath52\\ , , \\ ] ]    where , @xmath53\\ , , \\\\ v_{\\rm",

    "now , we no longer include the factor @xmath55 in its definition , see eq .",
    "( [ vquint ] ) .",
    "as explained before , we have also redefined the quintessence field according to @xmath26 in order to work with correctly normalized fields .",
    "the above expression represents the general form of the coupling between the sugra model of quintessence and inflation in supergravity .",
    "we now specify the inflaton model and consider the model described in the previous subsection with @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to work in terms of dimensionless quantities .",
    "in particular , we define the dimensionless potential @xmath56 by @xmath57 and this quantity can be written as @xmath58 where    @xmath59\\left(\\frac{\\phi } { { m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^4 { \\rm e}^{8\\pi \\xi ^2/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}^2 + 4\\pi q^2/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}^2}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this point , some remarks are in order .",
    "a priori , there is no clear separation between the inflaton and the quintessence fields in the term @xmath60 because of the presence of the exponential term .",
    "however , in the regime we will be studying ( during inflation ) , @xmath61 and , therefore , the exponential term will be very close to one . in this case , one recovers the simple chaotic model @xmath62 .",
    "the term @xmath63 is nothing but the sugra potential studied in ref .",
    "@xcite but , during inflation , it will reduce to the ratra - peebles case .",
    "let us notice that we have an extra factor @xmath64 originating from the term @xmath65 .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath66 since the moduli is stabilized at @xmath45 .",
    "finally , in the regime @xmath61 , the interaction term reads @xmath67 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we have @xmath68 as will be discussed below .",
    "the coupling constant between the inflaton and the quintessence fields reads @xmath69 .",
    "the planck mass appears in this expression because the coupling between the two fields has been entirely fixed by the supergravity .",
    "notice also that the quintessence field picks up an inflaton dependent mass term during inflation .",
    "the competition between this mass term and the ratra ",
    "peebles potential will be studied in the next section . finally , using the fact that @xmath70 \\left(\\frac{\\phi } { { m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^2\\right\\}\\ , , \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial ( q/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl } } } ) } & = & { \\rm e}^{8\\pi \\xi ^2/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}^2 + 4\\pi q^2/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}^2 } \\frac18\\left(\\frac{m}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^{4 + 2p } \\left(\\frac{q}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^{-2p } \\left[8\\pi \\frac{q}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}-2p\\left(\\frac{q}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^{-1}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { \\rm e}^{8\\pi \\xi ^2/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}^2 + 4\\pi q^2/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}^2 } \\left(\\frac{m}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\phi } { { m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^2 \\frac{q}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl } } } } \\biggl\\ { 4\\pi + 4\\pi ^2\\left[1 + 8\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\xi } { { m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^2 + 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{q}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^2\\right]\\left(\\frac{\\phi } { { m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^2 \\biggr\\}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easy to show that this potential possesses an absolute minimum given by @xmath71 the potential is represented in fig .  [ potqphi ] .",
    "the value @xmath72 is the minimum of the inflaton potential without interaction while @xmath73 is the minimum of the sugra potential . at the absolute minimum ,",
    "the value of the potential is non - vanishing and given by @xmath74 .",
    "let us now discuss the values of the free parameters that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ potqphi1 ] ) and  ( [ potqphi2 ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the quintessential part is responsible for the acceleration now then one should have @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the values of the quintessence field and of the hubble parameter ( respectively ) now , at vanishing redshift . in order to have a successful model of quintessence",
    ", the field should be on track today which in turn implies that @xmath78 .",
    "strictly speaking , this conclusion is valid for the ratra - peebles potential only , but it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this is also valid for the sugra potential despite the presence of the exponential correction ( this is simply because , except at small redshifts , we have @xmath61 and the exponential sugra correction does not play an important role ) .",
    "this gives @xmath79 using the fact that @xmath80 and assuming no fine - tuning of the coupling constant , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath81 , one deduces that @xmath82 in a sense this is the usual fine  tuning of the cosmological constant , it reappears here in the guise of the tuning of the vev of a field leading to the quintessence potential .",
    "however , if one works with an effective model valid up to a cut - off scale @xmath83 , then it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the previous problem can be solved provided the scale is chosen such that @xmath84 .",
    "then the value of the fayet ",
    "iliopoulos term can even be above the weak scale .",
    "however , again , our purpose here is not to study the details of the dark energy model and , therefore , in the following , we will ignore these subtleties and work with the value of @xmath85 derived before .",
    "let us notice that even with a fayet  iliopoulos term above the weak scale , in general , we still have @xmath86 and then the form of the coupling is not modified when one works with a cut - off scale much below the planck scale , see also the discussion after eq .",
    "( [ potqphi2 ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the constraint on the parameter characterizing the inflaton sector , _",
    "i.e.  _ the mass @xmath87 of the field .",
    "in order to simplify the discussion , we will assume that the initial conditions are such that quintessence field is always subdominant .",
    "in this situation the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field are at the origin of the cmb anisotropy observed today . as a consequence , and as is well - known , the cobe and wmap normalizations fix the coupling constant of the inflaton potential , namely the mass @xmath87 in the present context .",
    "more precisely , for small @xmath88 , the multipole moments are given by @xmath89 and what has been actually measured by the cobe and wmap satellites is @xmath90 .",
    "the quantity @xmath91 is the hubble parameter during inflation and is related to the potential by the slow - roll equation @xmath92 evaluated at hubble radius crossing . putting everything together , we find that the inflaton mass is given by @xmath93 that is to say @xmath94 all the parameters of the potential are now specified .",
    "let us now discuss in more detail what are the conditions under which the inflaton field is always dominant .",
    "the quintessence energy density must be smaller than the inflaton energy density .",
    "this gives a lower bound on the possible values of the field @xmath1 which can be expressed as @xmath95 where we have used the value of @xmath96 obtained before .",
    "the fact that we obtain a lower bound is consistent with the fact that the potential is an inverse power - law of the quintessence field : the smaller the field is , the larger the corresponding energy density is .",
    "secondly , there exists also an upper bound coming from the fact that the interaction energy density must be smaller than the inflaton energy density .",
    "concretely , this gives @xmath97 where we have used the fact that the maximal value of the inflaton field is @xmath98 , see below .    under the condition that @xmath99 , the behavior of the background is determined by the energy density of the inflaton and it is well - known that , in this case , the slow - roll approximation is valid .",
    "the slow - roll approximation is controlled by two parameters ( in fact , at leading order , there are three relevant slow - roll parameters but we will not need the third one ) defined by  @xcite @xmath100 in the present context , where the inflaton potential is proportional to @xmath101 , the slow - roll parameters are given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the number of e - folds between the time at which scales of astrophysical interest today left the hubble radius during inflation and the end of inflation .",
    "in the situation where these parameters are small , namely @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the equation of motion of the inflaton field can be easily integrated . for this purpose , it is convenient to express everything in terms of the number of e - folds ( not to be confused with @xmath106 ) defined by @xmath107 such that , at the beginning of inflation , one has @xmath108",
    ". then , in the slow - roll approximation , one obtains that the evolution of the field is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the initial value of the field .",
    "this value is related to the total number of e - folds given by @xmath111 if @xmath112 is the minimum number of e - folds required in order to solve the problems of the hot big - bang model ( @xmath113 ) then one has @xmath114 there exists also an upper bound for the value of the inflaton field which corresponds to the situation where the potential energy density @xmath115 is planckian . using that @xmath96 this",
    "immediately gives that @xmath116 .",
    "this is the value of @xmath117 that we considered before .",
    "we now turn to the resolution of the quintessence equation of motion , _",
    "i.e.  _ the klein - gordon equation .",
    "it can be written as @xmath118 with @xmath119 is the hubble parameter which only depends on the inflaton energy density .",
    "a dot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time .",
    "we now work with the new time variable introduced before , namely the number of e - folds .",
    "one gets @xmath120 the main feature of the above equation is that the potential is now explicitly time - dependent because of the interaction of @xmath1 with the inflaton , _",
    "i.e.  _ we have @xmath121 .",
    "this renders this equation very difficult to solve exactly .",
    "therefore , in order to get some analytical approximate solution , it is necessary to make some assumptions . with a very good accuracy , the fact that @xmath99 implies that the potential contains two dominant terms and can be approximated as @xmath122 . as a consequence ,",
    "its derivative can expressed as @xmath123 this means that the quintessence field evolves in a time - dependent potential which possesses a minimum . of course ,",
    "this minimum is explicitly time - dependent and can be expressed as    @xmath124^{-4 } \\right\\}^{1/[2(p+1)]}\\ , .\\ ] ]    as shown below , this equation turns out to be one of the main result of the present article .",
    "indeed , we will demonstrate that , after a period of rapid oscillations , the quintessence field always tends toward the above solution .",
    "therefore , in the case where the interaction between the inflaton and the quintessence field is important , @xmath125 can be viewed as a kind of attractor solution since , regardless of the initial conditions , the final value of the field is always given by @xmath126 .",
    "several remarks are in order at this stage .",

    "thirdly , we are now in a position where one can study how small fluctuations behave around the time - dependent minimum .",
    "the fluctuations are given by @xmath133 and their evolution is governed by the equation @xmath134 where , in the damping term , we have neglected the derivative of the hubble parameter which is nothing but the slow - roll parameter @xmath135 . using the expression of the effective mass established before and the expression of the inflaton in the slow - roll approximation",
    ", one finds that the solution can be expressed as @xmath136,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are two constants determined by the initial conditions .",
    "the functions ai and bi are the airy functions  @xcite in the damping term of eq .",
    "( [ kgefold ] ) as we did before , one works with the dimensionless field @xmath139 defined by @xmath140 then , from eq .",
    "( [ kgefold ] ) , it is easy to show that the field @xmath139 obeys @xmath141q \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{g(n)}\\left(\\frac{h}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^{-2 } \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial ( q/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}})}\\biggl\\vert _ { q/{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}=g(n)q(n)}=0\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second term between squared brackets , the various derivatives of the hubble parameter can be expressed in terms of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "explicitly , this term reads @xmath142 .",

    "the period of the oscillations can be very easily estimated .",
    "one has @xmath153 where we recall that @xmath154 is the total number of e - folds during inflation . for a typical model with @xmath155 and @xmath156",
    ", one gets @xmath157 .",
    "the previous equation also means that if the inflaton field starts at large values , then the period of the oscillations will be extremely rapid .",
    "for instance , if inflation starts at planckian density , then @xmath158 which implies that @xmath159",
    ". as a consequence , one can get values as small as @xmath160 .    therefore , from the above considerations , one reaches the conclusion that @xmath161 this means that the oscillatory phase is very quick in comparison with the typical time scale of evolution of the minimum . to put it differently",
    ", the minimum can be considered as motionless or as `` adiabatic '' as the field rapidly oscillates and quickly joins its minimum .",
    "therefore , @xmath162 can be viewed as an attractor since it does not depend on the initial conditions for the quintessence field .",
    "we have established the above result under the assumption that the initial deviation from the attractor @xmath125 is not too large ( or , in other words , that @xmath163 is not too large ) .",
    "what happens if this is not the case , _",
    "i.e.  _ if @xmath164 or @xmath165 ? is the attractor still joined rapidly enough ( _ i.e .",
    "_ before the end of inflation ) ?",
    "_ a priori _ , to answer this question requires a full integration of the equation of motion ( or a numerical integration , see the next subsection ) which is not possible .",
    "however , we can gain some partial insights using the following considerations .",
    "if one has @xmath166 then the term proportional to @xmath167 dominates in the potential and the klein - gordon equation remains non linear hence difficult to integrate .",
    "but if we now assume that we start from a situation where @xmath168 , then the term proportional to @xmath169 dominates in the potential . as a consequence , the derivative of the potential can be written as , see eq .",
    "( [ derpot ] ) @xmath170 therefore , the klein - gordon equation is now linear and can be integrated .",
    "in fact , one obtains the same potential as before for @xmath163 , up to an unimportant factor @xmath171 , except that now @xmath172 needs not to be small . as a consequence",

    "one scale describes the evolution of the adiabatic time - dependent minimum while the second one represents the period of the rapid oscillations around this minimum .",
    "we have demonstrated that @xmath187 is in fact an attractor and that , regardless of the initial conditions , the quintessence field always has enough e - folds during inflation to join this attractor . although the above conclusion has been established in the quadratic part of the potential , it is in fact true even in the regime where the potential is proportional to @xmath167 as confirmed by a numerical study of the klein - gordon equation .",

    "we see that the evolution is very similar to what was discussed before .",

    "one can check that the amplitude of the oscillations decreases as @xmath201 as demonstrated in the previous subsection .",
    "we conclude that all the properties established before are confirmed by the numerical study , even in the part of the potential where it is proportional to @xmath167 .",
    "however , one should also notice that , if the field is initially very displaced from its minimum such that @xmath166 , then the simple fortran code used to integrate the equation of motion can quickly run into numerical problems .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that @xmath167 is a very steep potential . despite this remark",

    "the remarks made before also apply to this case which appears to be in full agreement with the analytical estimates of the previous subsection .",
    "in order to study the influence of the interaction term and to compare its effect with the standard case , it is interesting to give the evolution of the quintessence field when this one does not interact with the inflaton ( and when @xmath1 remains a test field ) . in particular",
    ", we are interested in calculating , for a given initial condition at the beginning of inflation , the value of @xmath1 at the end of inflation ( or at the beginning of the radiation dominated era ) in both cases ( _ i.e .  _ with and without interaction ) . the case without interaction",

    "@xmath207 now means the ratra - peebles potential , namely @xmath208 since this is the potential for the quintessence field in absence of any interaction with the inflaton field . due to the smallness of the parameter @xmath135 ,",
    "the slow roll approximation can be applied to the equations describing the motion of the quintessence field without interaction if the following condition is satisfied @xmath209 if one applies this condition to the ratra - peebles potential , one gets @xmath210 this formula is similar to eq .

    "it can also be re - written as @xmath211 where @xmath212^{1/[2(p+1)]}\\simeq { \\cal o}(1)$ ] . then , integrating the klein - gordon equation leads to the following expression    @xmath213^{1/2(p+1)}\\ , , \\\\ & \\simeq & q_{\\rm ini}\\left[1 + 2p(p+1)\\left(\\frac{m}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^{-2 } \\left(\\frac{m}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^{4 + 2p } \\left(\\frac{q_{\\rm ini}}{{m_{_{\\mathrm pl}}}}\\right)^{-2(p+1 ) } \\frac{n}{n_{_{\\rm t}}}\\right]^{1/2(p+1)}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where in the last equality we have used the fact that the evolution of the inflaton field can be approximated by @xmath214 $ ] .",
    "the subscript `` no inter '' just reminds that the above equation gives @xmath1 in the case where there is no interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath34 . from this expression",
    ", we deduce that the quintessence field is frozen if @xmath215 if this condition is satisfied , then obviously the condition  ( [ srcond ] ) is also satisfied . the contrary is not necessarily true but , as show for instance in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , this only concerns a small range of initial conditions .",
    "therefore , we can consider that @xmath216 .",
    "we are now a position where the values of the quintessence field with and without interaction can be compared at the end of inflation .",
    "inflation stops when the slow - roll parameter @xmath135 is equal to unity corresponding to @xmath217 . with the interaction term taken into account",
    ", the field will be on the attractor @xmath125 and , therefore , its value at the end of inflation is just the value of @xmath125 at the end of inflation , namely @xmath218 as already mentioned , the striking feature of this expression is that it does not depend on @xmath219 . for orders of magnitude estimate , one can consider that @xmath220 .",
    "for @xmath155 , which is our fiducial model , one has @xmath221 .",
    "therefore the ratio of @xmath1 at the end of inflation without the interaction term taken into account to @xmath1 at the end of inflation with the interaction term into account is given by @xmath222 this ratio is necessarily greater than one , see eq .",
    "( [ frozen ] ) , and for `` large '' initial conditions can be much bigger than one .",
    "this means that , generically , @xmath223 ,",
    "_ i.e.  _ the effect of the interaction is to force the quintessence field to remain small during inflation .",
    "two loopholes could modify the above conclusion .",
    "firstly , we have seen that the numerical integration , on which our study is based , is valid only if the initial value of @xmath1 is not too far from the initial value of the minimum .",
    "we have used the results obtained under this condition and have extrapolated them for any initial conditions . if the initial value of the quintessence field is far from the time - dependent minimum , we still expect a phase of oscillations .",
    "however , since we have noticed that the amplitude of the oscillations tend to be quite big even if the initial displacement from the minimum remains reasonable ( this is not surprising for a potential like @xmath167 which is very `` abrupt '' ) , it could actually happen that the amplitude of the oscillations , in the case where the initial displacement is large , are so big that the assumption that the quintessence field is a test field becomes violated .",
    "this is a regime that has not been studied in the present article .",
    "some new interesting effects could occur in this case .",
    "however , we suspect that the numerical study of this situation could be quite tricky .",
    "secondly , it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the quantum effects could strongly modify the evolution of @xmath1 during inflation .",
    "these quantum effects have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite by means of the stochastic inflation formalism for a free field .",
    "therefore , what should now be done is to compute these effects in the case where the interaction term is present .",
    "this is clearly a difficult task which is beyond the scope of the present paper . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the quantum effects can push the quintessence field to quite large values at the end of inflation . as a consequence",
    ", the attractor solution could be joined only at late time and even after the present time . in this case",
    "the quintessential scenario would lose an attractive feature , namely its insensitivity to the initial conditions . in this respect ,",
    "the results reached in the present article are good news since the effect of the interaction term seems to retain the field to quite small values .",
    "one could speculate that this could maybe compensate the influence of the quantum effects .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the non - renormalizable interactions between the inflaton and the quintessence field have drastic consequences during inflation .",
    "the quintessence field follows an attractor and remains small compared to the planck scale at the end of inflation .",
    "this sets the initial conditions for the quintessence field .",
    "as is well known , the quintessence field can not couple strongly to matter field .",
    "on the contrary non - renormalizable couplings between the quintessence field and matter , in particular cold dark matter , may have a crucial impact on the late time physics of the quintessence field , i.e. on the coincidence problem . this is left for future work .          c.  l.  bennet _ et al .",
