    "one of the main goals during a long time , related to many - body interacting systems , has been the localization and description of their stable states . a special role in the research effort",
    "is played by the strongly correlated states of charges under large magnetic fields @xcite . for some of these states ,",
    "the analytical functions are available as in the case of the laughlin @xcite and the pfaffian @xcite expressions .",
    "the laughlin is the exact solution of a system under @xmath1-body contact interaction and the pfaffian is the exact solution for charges under @xmath2-body contact interaction @xcite .",
    "however , in general , the difficulty of the analysis has induced the development of the quantum simulation as one of the most fruitful ways to deal with the problem @xcite . in the quantum simulation ,",
    "charges are replaced by neutral cold atoms and real fields by artificial gauge fields .    within the framework of quantum simulation , we analyze some features of relevant states .",
    "our ansatz uses ultracold bosonic atoms and the artificial magnetic gauge field is associated with rotation of a parabolic potential that traps the bosonic cloud .",
    "we describe the system from the rotating frame of reference and employ the exact diagonalization technique .",
    "the quantum hall resistivity @xmath3 is used as a tool to show the presence of special ( probably the most important ) correlated states present at particular values of @xmath4 , the frequency of the rotation that plays the role of an effective magnetic field . at those values of @xmath4",
    "the resistivity displays a plateau .",
    "we prove that the presence of impurities is crucial for its appearance and make a microscopic analysis of the process .",
    "to mimic an electric field , we consider a periodic perturbation along the @xmath5 direction and study the time evolution of the generated current to model the transport equation and identify the resistivity .",
    "we concentrate on the case when @xmath4 is strong enough to produce vortex - liquid states in the lowest landau level ( @xmath6 ) regime .",
    "some previous articles @xcite that intended to classify the correlated states along the variation of the magnetic field , obtained the critical frequency ( @xmath7 ) that marks a phase transition .",
    "there appear two phases : on the one hand the phase related to the abrikosov vortex lattice states at large values of the filling factor ( @xmath8 ) or low values of @xmath9 . on the other hand , the phase of vortex liquid states of low @xmath8 and strong magnetic field .",
    "they obtained an estimated value of @xmath10 .",
    "however , all this analysis refers to a particular definition of the filling factor given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of particles and @xmath13 the number of vortices .",
    "they perform the calculation in a toroidal geometry that represents the bulk of a system containing a large number of vortices .",
    "their conclusion was that `` experiments access the quantum - melted vortex liquid phase will require specific attention to small system sizes and high angular momentum '' for which , indeed , cases like the laughlin or the pfaffian type states preserve its full meaning .    closely following our previous work @xcite for @xmath14",
    "we focus on the laughlin state and analyze the origin of the plateau of @xmath3 in the region where the expected value of the ground state ( gs ) angular momentum lies around @xmath15 ( in the circular symmetric case , @xmath16 for the laughlin state ) .",
    "next we extend our analysis to @xmath17 . in this case , a huge time consuming effort would be required to obtain a laughlin type state ( at around @xmath18 ) . however , despite the effort , the expectations of finding new physics beyond what was obtained already for @xmath14 are very low . aside from that , the presence of two pseudo - plateaux at lower values of @xmath9 brings the opportunity to identify the associated states using different tools .",
    "e.g. , the overlap with different analytical expressions or the analysis of the edge excitations .",
    "we found that the first plateau is related to the pfaffian @xcite state and the second one is well identified with the state of filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "the great interest on the pfaffian is justified by the unique properties of its excitations @xcite that make it attractive in the context of topological quantum computation .",
    "one of our main result is related to the fact that the analysis of the hall response of the system provides , in an exhaustive way , the presence of all the correlated states that manifest themselves as plateaux of the resistivity .",
    "the other main results is the direct observation of the ordered pattern of the gs , generated by @xmath2-body contact interaction in the density .",
    "this allows us to give a nice interpretation of the pfaffian state .",
    "usually , the spatial correlation of the atoms is hidden in a circular symmetric state and the analysis of the two - body pair correlation function is necessary to uncover it .",
    "one atom is fixed at a given position @xmath19 and the probability of finding the other ones around it , depends on this election .",
    "the existence of an impurity plays a similar role , the position of the impurity breaks the circular symmetry and the ordered pattern is explicit already in the density .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present our model , and a brief background of previous calculations on the hall resistivity . an extra term for 3-body",
    "contact interaction is included . in section iii",
    "we analyze the origin of the plateaux that emerge in the resistivity at particular values of the magnetic field .",
    "we also study the transitions of the expected value of the angular momentum as the magnetic field increases and relate these transitions to the parity symmetry - breaking at the single - particle ( sp ) level . in section",

    "if one of the natural orbitals is localized at the impurity , then we are able to distinguish between to type of states : localized and extended , a crucial condition necessary to understand the mechanism that produces a plateaux as will be explained in section iii .",
    "next we model the oscillating electric field @xmath76 by an extra time dependent term in the hamiltonian ,    @xmath77    given by    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the dimensionless parameter that gives the intensity of the perturbation which we assume small .",

    "the resistivity exhibits a linear behaviour given by    @xmath123    reminiscent of the classical functionality @xcite .",
    "@xmath124 is the areal density of the extended part of the system , the part that contributes to the current @xmath125 .",
    "as @xmath104 grows , the equivalent and simultaneous increase of @xmath124 is necessary to maintain the resistivity constant .",
    "then , during certain intervals of @xmath104 transfer from localized to extended orbitals must take place , increasing @xmath124 .",
    "impurities play the role of a reservoir of particles trapping or releasing them as @xmath104 changes .",
    "to be more precise , we analyze the properties of the gs . as @xmath104 increases , the angular momentum of the system also increases . in the symmetric case ( without impurities ) where @xmath28 is well defined ,",
    "there are abrupt changes and only certain `` magic '' values of @xmath28 are possible . for @xmath14 :",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath127 and @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath17 .",
    "differently , if some amount of asymmetry is included , the variation is soften and the expected value of the angular momentum has all the possibilities ( see figs.1 and 2 ) .    on the other hand , if one looks at the occupations of the two most important natural orbitals ( see figs.3 and 4 ) one can verify that there is a correspondence between the angular momentum transitions and the significant variation of the occupations . the contribution of the fd states in the expansion of the natural orbitals change as @xmath27 changes as we will comment in the section of results .",
    "amazingly , in both analyzed cases , there is a clear localization at the impurity of one of the natural orbitals ( see figs.5 and 6 ) . in both cases",
    "it is the first orbital with the largest occupation . around the frontiers of the transitions ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath130 means that transfer from localized to extended orbitals is possible and a plateau is expected .",
    "that is to say , intervals of @xmath104 , where the occupations of the natural orbitals have a significant variation , turned out to be crucial to identify the regions where transfer is possible and plateaux are expected .",
    "fig.7 shows for @xmath14 the appearance of a small plateau in the region where @xmath27 changes from @xmath37 to @xmath15 and fig.8 shows for @xmath17 two pseudo - plateaux around the transitions from @xmath36 to @xmath37 and from @xmath37 to @xmath15 respectively .",
    "it must be realized that these plateaux appear around special values of @xmath3 that localize states of significant interest , which would be characterized by fractional filling factors in the thermodynamic limit . without impurities",
    "these values of @xmath3 would not be visible , due to the fact that the interval where @xmath130 decreases , would be reduced to a point and the plateau would disappear .",
    "moreover , the extension of the plateau is related to the intensity of the impurity .",
    "an extended way to identify the gs that results from exact calculations is by the overlap with a given analytical expression .",
    "however it has been stressed @xcite that a more convenient and non - ambiguous way is by its `` topological order '' , a unique characteristic reflected in the properties of the edge excitations .",
    "this alternative becomes of special interest in our case , as in the calculation of the hall resistivity all the spectrum is implied and not only the gs .    in the case of the laughlin state for @xmath14 , this method provided the confirmation of its nature .",
    "we proved that the degeneracy of the edge excitations obey the theoretical predictions @xcite : an excited state with @xmath131 is @xmath132 times degenerated , where @xmath133 are the partitions of @xmath64 .",
    "it gives a sequence : @xmath134 for @xmath135 . from our results",
    ", the plateau appears at about @xmath136 well inside the region where the expected value of the angular momentum is close to @xmath137 . to count out the number of excited edge states ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we analyze the interaction energy ( @xmath138 ) as a function of the angular momentum starting from @xmath139 . for each @xmath140",
    "we obtain a column of eigenvalues .",
    "the distance between the lowest @xmath138 and the next one at @xmath137 defines a gap . in general , the number of values on the column @xmath141 that lies inside the gap , gives the number of the edge excitations for @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , for the laughlin state , all of them are degenerated .",
    "we obtain for @xmath14 the sequence : @xmath142 and for @xmath17 : @xmath143 .",
    "it must be realized that the assignation of a filling factor of @xmath144 to this state is due to the fact that the trapping potential is nearly suppressed by the strong rotation ( see eqs . 5 and 10 )",
    ", we end up with a nearly homogeneous system , for which the filling factor is well defined ( it does not depend on @xmath145 ) .",
    "however , for other correlated states produced at lower values of the magnetic field , strong size effects prevent the association of a fractional filling factor , and the only justified assertion is that this state presents good symptoms to be identify with the correlated state with well defined filling factor in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is our case related to the states at the plateaux for @xmath146 ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "the second plateau for @xmath17 at @xmath147 ( see fig.8 ) has several properties that led us to the conclusion that it is the precursor of the correlated state with @xmath148 , well approximated by the composite - fermion ( cf ) model .",
    "the starting requirement is the identification of the angular momentum .",
    "this plateau lies within the region close to the angular momentum @xmath139 , one of the magic values for @xmath146 , related to incompressible states : the interaction energy does not change when the angular momentum is increased , the internal energy remains the same and the increase of the kinetic energy is due to the global movement of the center of mass .",
    "once @xmath12 and @xmath28 are fixed , then as in the previous case , we proceed to count out the number of excited edge states .    within the cf theory ,",
    "the bosonic atoms are replaced by non - interacting composite particles consisting of a particle with a quantum of magnetic flux attached .",
    "these composite particles with fermionic statistics fill several ll in a compact way . at the end ,",
    "the fractional filling factor for bosons is transformed into integer filling factor for the composite particles and the relation between the angular momenta is given by @xmath149 @xcite . in our case",
    "it gives @xmath150 which has only one possible way to fill the landau levels : @xmath2 cf on the lll and @xmath1 on the first ll , this state is denoted as @xmath151 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 we obtain the cf states @xmath156 and @xmath157 respectively ( in general @xmath158 .",
    "for these three cases , the number of excited states evolves as : @xmath159 : @xmath160 , @xmath161 : @xmath162 and @xmath163 : @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "this state in the thermodynamic limit belong to the series @xmath166 @xcite the values at which fractional quantum hall is realized , @xmath167 is the number of occupied ll s . for @xmath168 it gives @xmath169 and from the relation @xmath170 valid for homogeneous systems @xcite",
    "the filling factor for the bosonic system is @xmath171 . in agreement with the identification previously obtained in @xcite .    in the case of the state related with the first plateau at @xmath172 ( see fig.8 ) , although the overlap with the analytical expression of the pfaffian state is excellent ( see fig.10 ) , the analysis of the number of edge excitations is not conclusive .",
    "our main result concerns , as mentioned previously , to our certainty of the presence of a precise number of correlated states below @xmath173 , fixed by computational limitations .",
    "moreover , we know at which values of @xmath9 we must look for them . for @xmath17 and @xmath174 we know that there are only two correlated states and in this case , we were able to identify them with high probability .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath9 beyond @xmath173 , we can not exclude the possibility to find new plateaux not identifiable with states properly modeled using the cf approach .",
    "once we have been able to generate plateaux and learned about their origin , the next step concerns to the classification of the implied correlated states and analyze their properties .",
    "we exploit several tools .",
    "a powerful one is the overlap of the exact solution with known analytical expressions .    for the laughlin case we have @xcite    @xmath175    where @xmath176 . or for the pfaffian @xcite ,    @xmath177    where @xmath178 and @xmath179 means a partition of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath180 indicates that the wave function is symmetrized over all the possible distributions of the particles into the subsets @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "fig.9 shows for @xmath14 the modulus of the overlap , @xmath181 @xcite between the laughlin state and the exact solution as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "although the exact solution contains a small amount of anisotropy , the overlap is extremely good , close to one along all the interval with angular momentum @xmath137 .",
    "this result confirms that the implied correlated state is the laughlin , but also tells us that the overlap is not enough to localize the plateau .",
    "the main reason is that in the overlap only the gs is implied , whereas in the resistivity all the eigenstates play a role .",
    "the excited states suffer , along the interval of @xmath137 , a redistribution as @xmath104 changes producing changes in the resistivity .",
    "one must look for the interval of @xmath104 where @xmath130 decreases as it happens approximately between @xmath41 and @xmath182 , see fig.3 .",
    "fig.10 shows similar results for @xmath17 . in this case , in the overlap , the analytic pfaffian expression is used .",
    "the interval with significant values corresponds to @xmath183 ( see fig.2 ) which is the angular momentum of the pfaffian state for @xmath17 . in general , @xmath184 for even @xmath12 and @xmath185 for odd @xmath12 @xcite . in the full line",
    "only @xmath1-body interaction was considered ( @xmath43 and @xmath107 ) whereas for the plus and cross symbols , we used @xmath108 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "although the overlap clearly improves when @xmath2-body interaction is included , some amount of @xmath1-body component must also be considered .",
    "if only @xmath2-body interaction is used , although the interaction energy @xmath138 of the gs vanishes , meaning that it is the solution of the @xmath2-body hamiltonian , we find zero overlap with the analytic expression ( eq.17 ) .",
    "_ et @xmath186 . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite propose an attractive and original protocol to generate and stabilize the pfaffian state in a bosonic system submitted to a rotating trap .",
    "they obtain that the best way to follow the scheme is by the suppression of the @xmath1-body interaction .",
    "we were not able to reproduce this result and conclude that for this small number or particles , some amount of @xmath1-body interaction is necessary to have a significant number of particles within each subset of the partition of @xmath12 .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", it was proven that at the sp level parity - symmetry breaking takes place during the evolution of @xmath9 where the nucleation of the first vortex happens , namely close to the jump from @xmath187 to @xmath188 ( at about @xmath189 with our parameters ) .",
    "the most occupied natural orbital changes its sp momentum from @xmath190 to @xmath191 .",
    "the use of the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) for low @xmath9 is appropriate except within the narrow region where the vortex nucleation occurs .",
    "differently , for large values of @xmath9 where we can not resort to the mfa , we find the following result : at the first plateau the most important component of @xmath192 ( see eq.6 and the paragraph below ) changes from @xmath191 to @xmath193 whereas at the second plateau it changes from @xmath193 to @xmath190 .",
    "we speculate with the possible relation between this behavior and the different shape of the plateaux ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "however this interpretation requires deeper analysis .",
    "next , we perform a complete analysis of the density and pair correlation function at the three points marked in fig.11 . only some special results are commented .",
    "we concentrate on the first plateau where the overlap with the pfaffian state is the best .",
    "the selected points intend to give the following information : the point @xmath115 @xmath116 not related to a plateau , is taken as a reference ; the point @xmath104 @xmath117 on the plateau with only @xmath1-body contact interaction and the point @xmath118 ( @xmath194 with @xmath1 and @xmath2-body interactions .",
    "we analyze in each case , the symmetric density ( @xmath25 ) the density with the impurity and the function @xmath195 . in all cases ,",
    "the reference position @xmath196 is the point where the symmetric density has its maximum .    at @xmath115",
    "we obtain the expected results for a non - correlated state .",
    "the symmetric density has a soft dimple at the center and exhibits a slight blown up at @xmath197 when the impurity is introduced , with otherwise no any sign of spatial correlation .",
    "the pair correlation function does not uncover any spatial order and at @xmath196 the density is close to zero .    at @xmath104 ,",
    "the symmetric density is nearly flat with a slight maximum at the center . with the impurity ,",
    "the density is blown up at @xmath197 and some subtle correlated positions appear around @xmath197 .",
    "the function @xmath198 exhibits an anomalous distribution , at @xmath196 the density is significant .",
    "this point is a precursor of point @xmath118    finally point @xmath118 shows an interesting result which drives us to give an interpretation of the meaning of the 3-body interaction .",
    "the symmetric density is quite flat with a slight minimum at the center , at odds with the point @xmath104 .",
    "however , when the impurity is introduced , we obtain the density distribution shown in fig.12 .",
    "this figure provides some insight into the meaning of the @xmath2-body interaction .",
    "even though our system has @xmath17 , the density shows only three peaks . a possible explanation is as follows .",
    "the pfaffian wave function is a symmetric combination of all possible partitions of @xmath12 . for each partition of @xmath12 containing subsets @xmath178 and @xmath179 ,",
    "in an effective way , the particles are classified : those in subset @xmath178 and those in subset @xmath179 .",
    "the repulsive 2-body interaction can only take place among particles pertaining to the same subset , let us call them @xmath73 and @xmath199 , and there is no interaction between particles in different subsets , let us call them @xmath73 and @xmath200 .",

    "we have developed an effective way to find and eventually classify the correlated states of a cloud of cold bosonic atoms in the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "we proved that although the overlap of the exact solution with some analytical known expressions of the gs wave functions is a powerful way to identify the state , it does not provide any insight on the localization or extension of the plateaux of @xmath201 .",
