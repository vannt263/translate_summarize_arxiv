    "the concordance model is one of the famous dark energy models ( de ) that is supported by numerous observations that show an acceleration expansion of the universe such as subsequent measurements of distant supernova @xcite and most recently from the analysis of the precision cosmological data by the planck collaboration @xcite . in this model there",
    "exist a positive cosmological constant ( cc ) @xmath4 term , so - called vacuum de , which has been introduced first by einstein and another terms that are contributed in the evolution of the universe such as matter ( baryons plus cold dark matter ) and radiation . despite of good consistency with measurements",
    ", it suffers with two profound problem .",
    "one of them which is the most theoretical enigmas of fundamental physics , so - called cosmological constant problem @xcite , or fine tuning , and the second one is cosmic coincidence problem ( see e.g. the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the former namely the preposterous mismatch between the measured value from cosmological observations and the typical prediction for @xmath4 in quantum field theory ( qft ) @xcite and the latter say about the ratio of dark matter to dark energy densities which must be bounded in order unity .",
    "it is a matter of fact that whether @xmath4 or its density of energy , @xmath7 , is truly a constant or is a function of time ( or scale factor @xmath8 or hubble rate @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is important to note that each model must satisfy at the same time theoretical considerations and constraints with observational data . following this ,",
    "different scenarios have been proposed . from one side , recently , a class of dynamical vacuum dark energy models ( dvm s ) were introduced @xcite that @xmath4 could be considered as a function of @xmath10 @xcite but equation of state is the same as cc ( i.e. @xmath11 ) . in these models ,",
    "authors have also considered an interaction between matter and dark energy in framework of the flat friedmann - lemater - robertson - walker ( flrw ) in einstein gravity and showed a  strong evidence \" against the @xmath4cdm @xcite , and hence in favor of the dvms.from the other side , many authors interested to consider dynamical dark energy models , with time varying @xmath12 , such as : scalar fields , both quintessence and phantom - like , modified gravity theories , phenomenological decaying vacuum models , holography scenarios , etc ( cf . the previous review articles , references therein and @xcite ) . these models , can however alleviate the cosmological problems , specially cosmic coincidence problem , but they had done less investigation about the fine tuning problem . hence , if we take the point of view that the dark energy density is a dynamical variable in quantum field theory in curved spacetime , it will be possible to better tackle the basic cc problems , as well as the cosmic coincidence problem that may be solved by interacting dynamical de models ( e.g. see our previous paper @xcite ) .",
    "recently , one of us with some authors studied on the cosmological implications and linear structure formation of such dynamical dark energy , so - called @xmath0-class . at last @xmath0-models were fitted to the observational data and they showed that these models improve significantly the fit quality of the @xmath4cdm , showing that a moderate dynamical de behavior is better than having a rigid @xmath4-term for the entire cosmic history @xcite .",
    "now we are in the point that using this kind of dynamical de into the brans - dicke ( bd ) theory of gravity .",
    "for the reason that the @xmath0-class de density belongs to a dynamical cosmological constant , we need a dynamical framework to accommodate it instead of einstein gravity .",
    "the best choice for this , is bd theory which is a scalar - tensor theory and was invented first by jordan @xcite and then ripened by brans and dicke @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on mach s principle , which is a fundamental principle to explain the origin of inertia . in attempting to incorporate mach s principle",
    ", the bd theory introduces a time dependent inertial scalar field @xmath13 , which plays the role of the gravitational constant @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 and is determined by distribution of mass of the universe .",
    "so the gravitational fields are described by the metric @xmath16 and the bd scalar field @xmath13 , which has the dimension @xmath17=[m]^{2}$ ] . in bd theory , the scalar field @xmath13 couples to gravity via a coupling parameter @xmath18 and it has been generalized for various scalar tensor theories . this theory passes the observational tests in the solar system domains @xcite and also has been tested by some famous cosmological tests such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite . in recent years , many authors have been studied on the some models of de ( e.g. holographic de , ricci de , ghost de , and etc . ) in the bd cosmology and have been found good result and fitting with observational data .",
    "most of these models can fit in the category of general @xmath0-class de models .",
    "so this can be a good motivation for taking this class of de models in the bd theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after a brief review on the brans - dicke cosmology",
    ", we introduce three classes of dynamical de in sec .",

    ". the equality of these two equations leads to following relation @xmath43the de density and its dynamical nature plays a crucial role on the evolution of the universe .",
    "hence , in the following we will consider three basic kind of dynamical de models as @xmath44where the `` @xmath45 '' corresponds to brans - dicke cosmology and `` @xmath0 '' calls for dynamical nature of de .",
    "note that @xmath20 has dimension 2 ( mass square ) and two parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 are dimensionless but @xmath48 , @xmath49 have dimension 1 and 2 in turn .",
    "free parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 will be fitted by the observational data while @xmath48 and @xmath49 could be restricted and related to the free parameters of each model which we will give a detailed discussion in next sections .",
    "in the following we will assume that the fluid contains two components , dark energy and dark matter , and to be more general we will regard two scenarios for these components:@xmath50 ) interacting case : these two components do not conserve separately but interact with each other in such a manner that the continuity equations take the form @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the interaction term .",
