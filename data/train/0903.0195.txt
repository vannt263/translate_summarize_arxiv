    "yet , natural gas is often the energy of choice for home heating and it is increasingly being used instead of oil for transportation  @xcite ,  @xcite . although renewable energy sources offer the best cuts in overall @xmath0 emissions , the generation of electricity from natural gas instead of coal can significantly reduce the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere . as the demand for natural gas rises in europe",
    ", it becomes more important to gain insights into the global transportation properties of the european gas network . unlike electricity , with",
    "virtually instantaneous transmission , the time taken for natural gas to cross europe is measured in days .",
    "this implies that the coordination among transport operators is less critical than for power grids .",

    "historically , critical infrastructure networks have evolved under the pressure to minimize local rather than global failures  @xcite .",
    "however , little is known on how this local optimization impacts network robustness and security of supply on a global scale .",
    "the failure of a few important links may cause major disruption to supply in the network , not because these links connect to degree hubs , but because they are part of major transportation routes that are critical to the operation of the whole network . here",
    "we adopt the view that a _ robust infrastructure network _ is one which has evolved to be error tolerant to failures of high load links .",
    "our method is slightly different from previous work on real world critical infrastructure networks with percolation theory  @xcite , which assume the simultaneous loss of many unrelated network components .",
    "the absence of historical records on the simultaneous failure of a significant percentage of components in natural gas networks implies that the methods of percolation theory are of little practical relevance in our case .",

    "gas pipeline networks have two main layers : transmission and distribution .",
    "the transmission network transports natural gas over long distances ( typically across different countries ) , whereas pipelines at the distribution level cover urban areas and deliver gas directly to end consumers .",

    "figure  [ fig : avg_node_degree](a ) suggests that both the transmission and the complete ( i.e. , transmission and distribution ) networks have approximately the same average degree because all points fall approximately along a straight line .",

    "given that the national networks have very different sizes , but approximately the same average degree , we looked for regularities in the probability distribution of degree of the european gas networks [ see fig .  [ fig : avg_node_degree](b ) ] .",
    "in accordance with previous studies of electrical transmission networks  @xcite , the complementary cumulative degree distribution of the transmission network decays exponentially as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",

    "[ fig : avg_node_degree](b ) .",
    "this suggests that the gas network may be approximated by an exponential network at transmission level , but not when the distribution level is considered as well .",
    "the distribution network is mainly composed of trees which attach to nodes in the transmission network , thus forming the complete network .",

    "this has the consequence of improving the local error tolerance because the failure of one pipeline implies only a decrease in flow .",
    "motivated by the finding of error tolerance in the gas pipeline networks , we then asked the question of whether there are global topological properties of the european network which could characterize the network robustness .",
    "to gain insights into the overlaid infrastructure and aggregate flow networks , we propose two complementary approaches which aim at identifying the backbones of the overlaid networks in figs .  [",
    "fig : eu_gas_net ] and  [ fig : trade_network ] . in both approaches",
    ", the flow network allows an approximate estimate of the volume of directed flows as we will detail in [ sec : bc_in_fn ] .    in the first approach , we assume that transport occurs along the shortest paths in geographical space .",
    "we search for a global backbone characterised by the presence of flow corridors where individual components were designed to sustain high loads .    in the second approach",
    ", we look at fault tolerance when single components fail .",
    "recent studies of network vulnerability in infrastructure networks suggest that , although these networks have exponential degree distributions , under random errors or attacks the size of the percolation cluster decreases in a way which is reminiscent of scale - free networks  @xcite .",
    "typically , these studies presume that a large percentage of nodes or links may become nonoperational simultaneously , i.e. , the time scale of node or link failure is much faster than the time scale of repair .",
    "whereas the underlying scenario of a hacker or terrorist attack on an infrastructure network causing large damage is certainly worth studying  @xcite , the consequences of such attacks may not be assessed properly when measuring damage by the relative size of the largest component . here , we estimate the loss of flow when a single link is non - operational .",
    "we search for a global backbone characterised by corridors of interconnected nodes , where the removal of one single link causes a high loss of flow from source to sink nodes .",
    "the maximum flow problem and the shortest paths problem are complementary , as they capture different aspects of minimum cost flow .",
    "shortest path problems capture link lengths , but not capacities ; maximum flow problems model link capacities , but not lengths .",
    "many networks are in fact substrates , where goods , products , substances or materials flow from sinks to sources through components laid out heterogeneously in geographical space .",
    "examples range from supply networks  @xcite , spatial distribution networks  @xcite and energy networks  @xcite to communication networks  @xcite .",
    "node and link stress in these networks is often characterised by the betweenness centrality . consider a substrate network @xmath33 with node - set @xmath34 and link - set @xmath35 .",
    "the betweenness centrality of link @xmath36 is defined as the relative number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes which pass through @xmath31 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of shortest paths from node @xmath39 to node @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the number of these paths passing through link @xmath31 .",
    "the concept of betweenness centrality was originally developed to characterise the influence of nodes in social networks  @xcite and , to our knowledge , was used for the first time in the physics literature in the context of social networks by newman  @xcite and in the context of communication networks by goh  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "betweenness centrality is relevant in man - made networks which deliver products , substances or materials as cost constraints on these networks condition transportation to occur along shortest paths .",
    "however , nodes and links with high betweenness in spatial networks are often near the network barycentre  @xcite , whose location is given by @xmath42 , whereas the most important infrastructure elements are frequently along the periphery , close to either the sources or the sinks .",
    "although flows are conditioned by a specific set of sources and sinks , the traffic between these nodes may be highly heterogeneous and one may have only access to aggregate transport data , but not to the detailed flows between individual sources and sinks ( e.g. competition between operators may prevent the release of detailed data ) . here",
    "we propose a generalization of betweenness centrality in the context of flows taking place on a substrate network , but where flow data are available only at an aggregate level .",
    "we then show in the next section how the generalized betweenness centrality can help us to gain insights into the structure of trans -",
    "european gas pipeline networks .",
    "the substrate network is often composed of sets of nodes which act like aggregate sources and sinks .",
    "the aggregation can be geographical ( e.g. , countries , regions or cities ) , or organizational ( e.g. , companies or institutions ) . if the flow information is only available at aggregate level then a possible extension of the betweenness centrality for these networks is to weight the number of shortest paths between pairs of source and sink nodes by the amount of flow which is known to go through the network between aggregated pairs of sources and sinks . to do this",
    ", we must first create a flow network by partitioning the substrate network , @xmath33 , into a set of disjoint subgraphs @xmath43 .",

( [ eq : rb ] ) , generalized betweenness , and eq",
    "( [ eq : max - flow - vitality ] ) , generalized vitality , reveals that both measures have the physical units of gas flow given by @xmath71 .",
    "further , the relative number of shortest paths crossing a link @xmath31 is bounded by @xmath72 , and the relative quantity of flow which must go through the same link @xmath31 is also bounded by @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the generalized betweenness ( [ eq : rb ] ) and generalized vitality ( [ eq : max - flow - vitality ] ) can be compared for each link .    to examine the relationship between these two quantities",
    ", we considered three simplified illustrative networks : a rooted tree where the root is the source node and all other nodes are sinks , the same rooted tree with additional links interconnecting children nodes at a selected level , and two communities of source and sink nodes connected by one single link .",
    "we chose these particular examples because they resemble subgraphs which appear frequently on the european gas pipeline network and thus they may help us to gain insights into the structure of the real world network .",
    "both the generalized betweenness and vitality have the same values on the links of trees where the root is the source node and the other nodes are sinks . to see this , consider without loss of generality the case when @xmath74 .",
    "then , the generalized betweenness of a link is the proportion of sinks reachable ( along shortest paths ) over the link , and the generalized vitality is the proportion of sinks fed by the link .",
    "the two quantities have the same value on the links of a tree and we illustrated this in fig .",
    "[ fig : example](a ) , where we drew link thickness proportional to the generalized betweenness ( gray ) and generalized vitality ( black ) .    figure  [ fig : example](b ) shows a modified tree network where we have connected child nodes at a chosen level .",
    "here , the shortest paths between the root and any other node are unchanged from the example of the tree , but removing a link @xmath31 situated above the lateral interconnection does not cut all connections between the source ( root ) and sink nodes . as a consequence the values of generalized vitality are significantly smaller in the upper part of the graphs .",
    "figure  [ fig : example](c ) shows two communities connected by one link , where source nodes are on one community and sink nodes on the other .",
    "this example is interesting for two reasons .",
    "first , the arguments used to explain why generalized betweenness and vitality take the same values on trees are also valid in this example .",
    "second , the link connecting the two communities has a much higher value of generalized betweenness and vitality than the links inside the communities , which led us to expect that these two measures could hint at the presence of modular structure in the real world network .",
    "the generalized betweenness measure , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rb ] ) , assumes that gas is transported from sinks to sources along the shortest paths . to investigate whether this hypothesis is correct",
    ", we plotted the european gas pipeline network and drew the thickness of each pipeline proportional to the value of its generalized betweenness ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : restricted_bc ] ) .",
    "we found that major loads , predicted by the generalized betweenness centrality , were on the well - known high capacity transmission interconnections such as the `` transit system '' in the czech republic , the `` eustream '' in slovakia , the `` yammal - europe '' crossing belarus and poland , the `` interconnector '' connecting the uk with belgium or the `` trans - mediterranean '' pipeline linking algeria to mainland italy through tunisia and sicily .",
    "the dramatic difference between the values of generalized betweenness of all the major european pipelines and the rest of the network suggests that the network has grown to some extent to transport natural gas with minimal losses along the shortest available routes between the sources and end consumers .",
    "these major pipelines are the transportation backbone of the european natural gas network .    during the winter season",
    ", cross - border pipelines are used close to their full capacity  @xcite . in this situation",
    ", the generalized vitality of a pipeline [ eq . ( [ eq : max - flow - vitality ] ) ] can be interpreted as the network capacity drop , or the amount of flow that can not be delivered , if that pipeline becomes nonoperational .",
    "the obvious drawback of the generalized vitality is that it takes into account the overall existing network capacity without considering the length of paths .",
    "conversely , the generalized betweenness considers the length of shortest paths , but not the capacity of pipelines .",
    "since we assess the network from two complementary view points , we expect that the results will allows us to get a more complete picture of the general properties of the european gas pipeline network .",
    "figure  [ fig : max - flow - betweenness ] shows the values of the generalized vitality in the european gas pipeline network .",
    "we found several relatively isolated segments with high a generalized vitality located in eastern europe , close to the spanish - french border , as well as on the south of italy .",
    "the high values of the generalized vitality in eastern europe can be explained by two factors .",
    "on one hand , the generalized vitality of pipelines close to the sources is higher than elsewhere simply because these pipelines are the bottleneck of the network . on the other hand ,",
    "our approximation that a directed link in the flow matrix implies gas flowing from all nodes in the source to all nodes in the sink countries was clearly coarse - grained for flows between russia and the baltic states , as it would imply that pipelines in southern russia would also supply the baltic countries .",
    "this highlights boundary effects on the calculation of betweenness vitality , as the data set excluded most of the russian gas pipeline network .",
    "the case of the spanish - french border was different , though .",
    "the link with high vitality separates the iberian peninsula from the rest of mainland europe .",
    "if this link was to be cut , then portugal and spain would only be linked to the pipeline network through morocco .",
    "finally , the south of italy highlights an interesting example of two communities ( europe and north africa ) separated by the trans - mediterranean pipeline , which is reminiscent of the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : example](c ) .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , we found that the generalized vitality is more or less homogeneous in most of mainland europe .",
    "this result suggests that the eu gas pipeline network has grown to be error tolerant and robust to the loss of single links .",
    "distribution networks originate from the need for an effective connectivity among sources and sinks  @xcite .",
    "for example , a spanning tree is highly efficient as it transports goods from sinks to sources in a way that shortens the total length of the network , thereby increasing its efficiency and viability .",
    "if the european gas pipeline network had been built as a spanning tree , its links would have very similar values of generalized betweenness and max - flow vitality ( see fig .  [ fig : example ] ) .",
    "the values of the generalized betweenness are considerably higher than the corresponding values of generalized vitality for the most important pipelines in the european union . in other words ,",
    "the major pipelines are crossed by many shortest paths , but a nonoperational pipeline causes only a minor capacity drop in the network . this dramatic contrast between the two measures reveals a _ hot backbone _  @xcite showing that the trans - european gas pipeline network is robust , i.e. error tolerant to failures of high load links .",
    "we analysed the trans - european gas pipeline network from a topological point of view .",
    "we found that the european national gas pipeline networks have approximately the same value of average node degree , even if their sizes vary over three orders of magnitude .",
    "like the electrical power grid , the degree distribution of the european gas transmission network decays exponentially .",
    "unexpectedly , the degree distribution of the complete ( transmission and distribution ) gas pipeline network is heavy tailed . in some countries which are crucial for the transit of gas in europe ( austria , the czech republic , italy and slovakia ) , we found that the main gas pipelines are organized along high capacity corridors , where capacity is split among two or more pipelines which run in parallel , over - bridging long distances .",
    "this implies that the network is error tolerant because the failure of one pipeline causes only a decrease in flow .",
    "motivated by the finding of error tolerance in national networks , we then addressed the problem of capturing the topological structure of the european gas network .    at a global scale , the growth of the european gas pipeline network has been determined by two competing mechanisms .",
    "first , the network has grown under cost and efficiency constraints to minimize the length of transport routes and maximize transported volumes .",
    "second , the network has developed error tolerance by adding redundant links .",
    "the combination of the two mechanisms guarantees that the european gas pipeline network is robust , i.e. error tolerant to failures of high load links . to reveal the network robustness , we analysed two measures  the generalized betweenness and generalized vitality  which highlight global backbones of transport efficiency and error tolerance , respectively .",
    "finally , we proposed that the hot backbone of the network is the skeleton of major transport routes where the network is robust , in other words , where values of generalized betweenness are high and values of generalized vitality are low .",
    "our method is of potential interest as it provides a detailed geographical analysis of engineered distribution networks .",
    "further research in continent - wide distribution networks could proceed along several directions .",
    "the optimality of existing networks and the existence of scaling laws could be approached from a theoretical perspective  @xcite . planned and",
    "under - construction pipelines may change the robustness of the network , in particular within their geographical vicinity .",
    "liquefied natural gas ( lng ) , which is nowadays transported at low cost between continents , is increasingly supplying the pipeline network .",
    "the combined effect of lng and storage facilities throughout the european coastline has the potential to reduce the dependency on one single exporting country , such as russia .",
    "last , but not the least , the dispute between russia and ukraine in january 2009 has brought supply security to the top of the european political agenda and highlighted how the european gas network is robust to engineering failures , yet fragile to geopolitical crises .    we wish to thank dirk helbing , sergi lozano , amin mazloumian and russel pride for valuable comments , and gratefully acknowledge the support of eu projects manmade ( grant no .",

    "the capacity of a pipeline can be schematically derived as follows : it is known that the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid in a circular pipe can be described in the laminar regime ( with a parabolic velocity profile ) by the hagen - poiseuille equation  @xcite , which states that the volume of fluid passing per unit time is      where @xmath76 is the pressure difference between the two ends of the pipeline , @xmath77 is the length of the pipeline ( thus , @xmath78 is the pressure gradient ) , @xmath79 is the dynamic viscosity , and @xmath17 is the radius of the pipeline . however , the gas network operates in the turbulent regime , and the hagen - poiseuille equation is no longer valid .",

    "<S> these findings suggest that the trans - european gas pipeline network is robust , i.e. , error tolerant to failures of high load links . </S>"
