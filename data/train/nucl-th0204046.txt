    "for many processes involving pions scattering from multi - nucleon systems , the kinematics are such that the pions must be included as dynamical particles , as they can carry energy and momentum that is not small compared to their rest mass , and can be far off - shell",
    ". however , in the case of low - energy pion - deuteron ( @xmath4 ) scattering one has a situation where the pions can carry energy and momentum that puts them on or near their mass - shell , both on external legs and internally in some diagrams .",
    "furthermore , given the small binding energy of the deuteron , the two nucleons in the deuteron are off their mass - shell by an amount that is far less than the pion mass .",
    "therefore , we can construct an effective field theory ( eft ) where non - relativistic nucleons interact via contact operators , and pions near their mass - shell are included as massless particles that generate a coulomb - like potential .",
    "the construction of this low - energy eft is similar to the development of the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite and non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite .",
    "the eft relevant to momentum transfers much less than the pion mass , in which nucleons interact via contact operators , is known as the pionless eft , or @xmath5 .",
    "the power - counting rules in @xmath5 are now an established part of the nuclear physics literature and can be found in several review articles  @xcite , together with reviews of the substantial array of phenomena that have been studied in @xmath5 . a recently developed variant of @xmath5 is particularly suited to high - order , precision calculations  @xcite . in this eft , known as dibaryon pionless eft , or @xmath6 , the @xmath7 nn effective range parameter , @xmath8 , is taken to be of order @xmath9 in the power counting , where @xmath10 is a small momentum  @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to the use of fields to account for nonperturbative enhancements  @xcite .",
    "in @xmath6 , operators are ordered according to powers of the total center - of - mass energy  @xcite . unlike @xmath5",
    ", the higher - dimension operators involving external fields are not renormalized by the s - wave strong interactions , and therefore do not scale with inverse powers of the renormalization scale .",
    "thus , naive dimensional analysis of these operators is sufficient to estimate their contribution to a given process . due to these technical advantages",
    ", we will work with @xmath6 in this paper .",
    "given that both @xmath5",
    "@xcite and @xmath6  @xcite have been studied in detail , the remaining ingredient is the pion . in analogy with hqet and heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath11pt ) , for processes involving the pions",
    "very near their mass - shell it is convenient to perform field redefinitions to remove the classical trajectory of a pion and use nonrelativistic kinematics . in the limit that the nucleon mass is infinitely larger than the pion mass , and the deuteron binding energy",
    "is taken to be much smaller than any other scale in the problem , the pion kinetic energy in the deuteron rest frame , @xmath12 , can be taken to be a constant even in loop diagrams .",
    "furthermore , the theory can be constructed in terms of the annihilation and creation operators for the pions . in loop",
    "diagrams the typical pion residual kinetic energy is of order @xmath13 , while its momentum is of order @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the deuteron binding momentum .",
    "thus , as is the case in nrqcd , it is possible and necessary to treat the residual energy operator in perturbation theory . working in the isospin limit , the leading - order ( lo ) lagrange density describing non - interacting `` heavy pions '' , @xmath14 , is   such that @xmath15 , in which case the kinetic term would be @xmath16 which is a more familiar form for the non - relativistic lagrange density .",

    "the propagator for the pion has the form @xmath23 which is independent of @xmath24 , and reduces down to that of a `` potential photon '' in nrqed or a `` potential gluon '' in nrqcd , ( i.e. @xmath25 ) in the limit that the pion has vanishing kinetic energy , @xmath26 .",
