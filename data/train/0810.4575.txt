    "stars surrounded by transitional disks have characteristics that fall between objects that have clear evidence for disks and stars with no disk material .",
    "they have deficits of infrared flux at @xmath7 @xmath8 8 but show strong excesses at longer wavelengths , indicating that the innermost regions have undergone significant clearing of small dust grains @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ has greatly improved our resolution in the infrared and has recently provoked extensive modeling studies of several transitional disks around t tauri stars e.g tw hya @xcite , gm aur , dm tau @xcite , cs cha @xcite , hd 98800b @xcite , and hen 3 - 600 @xcite .",
    "these objects have been explained as inwardly truncated disks which are optically thick to the stellar radiation , with most of the mid - infrared emission originating in the inner edge or  wall \" of the outer disk .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) point to holes in these disks of less than @xmath040 au .",
    "the inner holes of the transitional disks around dm tau and coku tau@xmath94 are cleared of small dust grains @xcite while the transitional disks gm aur , tw hya , cs cha , hd 98800b , and hen 3 - 600 have a small yet detectable near - infrared excess produced by some submicron and micron sized optically thin dust remaining in the inner disk hole @xcite .",
    "in addition to these disks with holes ( i.e. large reductions of small dust grains from the star out to an outer optically thick wall ) , the  pre - transitional disk \" class has recently been identified @xcite .",
    "these objects , exemplified by ux tau a and lkca 15 , have an inner optically thick disk separated from an outer optically thick disk by an optically thin gap @xcite .",
    "one possible cause for these dust clearings in transitional and pre - transitional disks is planet formation .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations have shown that a newly formed planet could accrete and sweep out the material around it through tidal disturbances @xcite .",
    "stellar companions could also dynamically clear the inner disk @xcite .",
    "additional dust clearing theories include inside - out evacuation induced by the mri @xcite and photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "the holes of gm aur , tw hya , and dm tau can potentially be explained by the mri .",
    "it has been proposed that the mri can operate on the ionized inner wall of the disk which leads material to accrete from the wall onto the star , creating a hole in the disk that grows from the inside - out @xcite . in order for photoevaporation to be effective",
    ", the disk mass must be below @xmath00.005 m@xmath10 and the disk accretion rate must fall below the wind rate ( @xmath010@xmath11 m@xmath10 yr@xmath5 ; alexander & armitage 2007 ; aa07 ) .",
    "photoevaporation can not explain the holes of these three objects since their outer disks are massive ( m@xmath12 @xmath13 0.05 m@xmath10 ; calvet et al . 2002 , 2005 ) and their accretion rates are higher than the photoevaporative wind rate",
    ". neither the mri nor photoevaporation can explain the gaps seen in ux tau a and lkca 15 given that these inside - out clearing mechanisms can not account for a remnant optically thick inner disk .",
    "photoevaporation could in principle explain coku tau@xmath94 s hole since this object has a weak outer disk ( m@xmath12 @xmath0 0.0005 m@xmath10 ; andrews & williams 2005 ) and a non - detectable accretion rate , however , its disk clearing is most likely caused by its recently discovered stellar companion @xcite .",
    "hd 98800b and hen 3 - 600 are additional examples of a transitional disk where a stellar companion is apparently responsible for the disk s hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found a companion in the inner hole of cs cha although the separation of the stellar pair is less than 5 au ( eike guenther , private communication ) which is too small to explain the truncation of the outer disk at @xmath0 43 au @xcite with existing models @xcite . to date , a radial velocity detection of a planetary companion in a transitional disk has only been claimed in tw hya @xcite .",
    "while most transitional disk studies have focused on objects located in 12 myr old star - forming regions with relatively isolated star formation , here we present detailed modeling of cvso 224 , the only transitional disk located in the @xmath010 myr old 25 orionis group @xcite in the orion ob1a subassociation @xcite .",
    "we present the sed of cvso 224 , which is also known as 1a@xmath141200 ( hernndez et al . 2007 ) and 05254675 + 0143303 ( 2mass ) , in figure 1 . b- and",

    "according to theories of magnetospheric accretion , the inner disk is truncated by the stellar magnetic field and material is channeled onto the star via accretion columns .",

    "cvso 224 , a m3 star @xcite with ew(h@xmath1 ) of @xmath32 20  , can be classified as a weakly accreting t tauri star ( wtts ) @xcite .",
    "however , some stars which lie just below this ew(h@xmath1 ) limit could be slow accretors @xcite . when analyzing the high - resolution spectrum of cvso 224 taken with hectochelle ( fig .",
    "2 ) we find that the width of the h@xmath1 profile at 10@xmath33 is larger than 200 km / s indicating that this star is accreting @xcite .",
    "we estimated the accretion rate using the magnetospheric accretion models of muzerolle et al .",
    "see that paper for the details of the fitting procedure . in short",
    ", we calculated models using the mass , radius , and effective temperature of the star as fixed inputs .",
    "the gas temperature , density ( calculated from @xmath6 ) , and inclination were then varied to find the best fit to the observed line profile .",
    "the profile of cvso 224 has a central self - reversal as seen in wtts ( e.g. figure 1 of muzerolle et al .",
    "2000 ) , but also has broad wings and redshifted absorption .",
    "this suggests that we are seeing signatures of both the stellar chromosphere and the accreting material traveling in the magnetospheric field lines .",
    "since the line core is dominated by chromospheric emission , which is not included in the models , only the line wings were considered in the fit .",
    "the resultant best - fit model parameters are @xmath34=30@xmath35 , t@xmath22=12,000 k ,",
    "@xmath6=7@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath10 yr@xmath5 . the inclination angle derived here is constrained to about 50@xmath33 of the nominal value of 30@xmath35 since the actual geometry is likely much more complicated @xcite .",
    "we adopt this value for cvso 224 since there is no other estimate for the inclination angle .      when we compare cvso 224 to the median sed of taurus ( fig . 1 ; dalessio et al .",
    "1999 , furlan et al .",
    "2006 ) which has been shown to be representative of a full disk @xcite , it is apparent that there is a strong infrared deficit , indicating that cvso 224 is surrounded by a transitional disk .",
    "we follow dalessio et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to calculate the structure and emission of the optically thick disk s inner edge or  wall , \" assumed to be vertical and axisymmetric .",
    "the radiative transfer in the wall atmosphere is calculated with m@xmath17 , r@xmath17 , t@xmath17 , distance , inclination , and @xmath6 as well as minimum and maximum grain sizes ( table 1 ) .",
    "we use a grain - size distribution that follows a power - law of @xmath36@xmath37 , where @xmath36 is the grain radius .",
    "we assume ism sized grains and adopt a@xmath21=0.005 and a@xmath22=0.25 @xcite .",
    "the wall has a radial gradient of temperature and we use its outermost temperature , t@xmath23 , as a free parameter in fitting the sed .",
    "this temperature , combined with the dust composition , determines the wall radius @xcite .",
    "the best fit to the sed is shown in figure 3 and corresponds to t@xmath23=120 k and r@xmath23=7 au .",
    "the wall height , z@xmath23 ( 1 au ) , is also a free parameter which is dependent on the best - fit to the sed .",
    "varying the inclination angle within 50@xmath33 of 30@xmath35 does not change the size of the inner hole .",
    "cvso 224 has a near - infrared excess ; the ratio of its observed to photospheric emission at 5.8 is 1.6 .",
    "the low value of t@xmath23 implies that the wall can account for neither the 10 silicate - feature emission nor the small near - ir excess .",
    "while a wall with a higher t@xmath23 produces more 10 emission , it can not account for the excess beyond 20 .",
    "as is seen in previous studies @xcite , a small amount of optically thin dust can account for the 10 emission and the near - ir excess .",
    "following @xcite , the spectrum for the optically thin region is calculated as the sum of the emergent flux from optically thin annuli where the dust in each annulus is heated by stellar radiation .",
    "we hold the inner radius fixed at the dust destruction radius ( 0.04 au ) and the outer radius is determined by the best fit ( 1 au ) .",
    "the silicate feature is well fit with a@xmath22=4 and probes temperatures of @xmath01901110 k. about 4@xmath210@xmath30 @xmath4 of dust exists in the optically thin region which in the models is composed of @xmath080@xmath33 amorphous silicates , @xmath014@xmath33 organics , @xmath03@xmath33 amorphous carbon , @xmath02.6@xmath33 troilite , and less than 1@xmath33 enstatite and forsterite .",
    "the total emission of this optically thin region is scaled to the vertical optical depth at 10 , @xmath38 @xmath0 0.025 .",
    "since there are no far - infrared or millimeter measurements for cvso 224 , we can not constrain the contribution to the sed from the outer disk . however",
    ", previous papers have shown that the wall and optically thin dust region dominate the mid - infrared flux @xcite and so in this first approximation we neglect the outer disk .",
    "cvso 224 is @xmath010 myr old , making it one of the oldest transitional disks around a classical t tauri star .",
    "tw hya is another @xmath010 myr old transitional disk that has been studied in detail . in both objects",
    ", there is an inner hole of @xmath3210 au that contains optically thin dust that is larger than ism - sized grains @xcite . the @xmath02 myr old cs cha also has larger grains in its optically thin region @xcite . in contrast , lkca 15 and gm aur in taurus ( @xmath01 myr old ) have small ism - sized grains in their optically thin regions @xcite .",
    "these optically thin disks are possibly the result of the inward drift of small dust grains from the outer disk @xcite .",
    "larger dust grains in the optically thin regions of older transitional disks may imply that there is some correlation between the process that creates the optically thin dust and dust evolution over time . like gm aur and lkca 15 , cvso 224 and tw hya have no obvious signs of crystalline silicates in their disks .",
    "this is hard to explain given that one would expect 10 myr of processing to result in crystalline silicates .",
    "this lack of cystallization is in contrast to several young full disks in taurus which show high degrees of dust processing ( watson et al .",
    "cvso 224 is an ideal target to test the role of photoevaporation in transitional disks .",
    "photoevaporation will create an inner hole in disks with masses @xmath80.005 m@xmath10 and mass accretion rates below the photoevaporative wind rate of @xmath010@xmath11 m@xmath10 yr@xmath5 ( aa07 ) .",
    "cvso 224 s @xmath6 is below the photoevaporative wind rate , however , we are detecting a robust mid - infrared excess beyond 20 from the disk s wall .",
    "this excess agrees with the median sed of taurus t tauri disks ( figure 1 ) and is similar to what is observed in other massive ( m@xmath12 @xmath13 0.05 m@xmath10 ) transitional disks ( e.g. dm tau , gm aur ; calvet et al .",
    "2005 ) , indicating that cvso 224 still has a substantial outer disk .",
    "this indication of a massive outer disk is evidence against photoevaporation being the main cause of clearing behind the hole we observe in cvso 224 .",
    "additionally , aa07 show that the size of the inner hole should reach tens of au within 0.1 myr of the onset of photoevaporation .",
    "excluding the unlikely possibility that we are catching cvso 224 immediately after photoevaporation has switched on , one would expect the inner hole to be larger and the outer disk to be mostly gone .",
    "millimeter observations of cvso 224 are necessary to confirm that it has a massive disk in order to eliminate the possibility that photoevaporation is creating the disk hole around cvso 224 .",
    "if cvso 224 does have a massive disk and is not being photoevaporated , one can speculate that the @xmath6 of the outer disk , @xmath39 , is actually higher than the observed accretion rate onto the star , @xmath40 .",
    "one way to create a situation where @xmath40 is less than @xmath39 is with planet formation .",
    "if a planet is forming in the disk , the mass coming from the outer disk is shared by the planet and the inner disk ( lubow & dangelo 2006 ; najita et al .",
    "2007 ; aa07 ) .",
    "@xcite show that the mass accretion rate past a planet and into the inner disk is 10 - 25 @xmath33 of the mass accretion rate outside the planet s orbit .",
    "alternatively , the low mass accretion rate of cvso 224 could also be due to a stellar companion .",
    "hen 3 - 600 is another weakly accreting @xmath010 myr old transitional disk ( 7@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath10 yr@xmath5 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "2000 ) whose hole is most likely due to dynamical clearing by its companion @xcite .",
    "its low @xmath6 also indicates that photoevaporation should be clearing this disk , however , hen 3 - 600 has a small hole ( @xmath01 au ; uchida et al .",
    "2004 ) and its infrared excess @xcite indicates a substantial outer disk .",
    "hen 3 - 600 s @xmath40 could be limited by binary tidal forces @xcite and not be reflective of @xmath39 .",
    "cvso 224 presents an opportune test of photoevaporation and planet formation in older disks and further observations of this object will help clarify the role of photoevaporation in disk clearing .",
    "millimeter studies of cvso 224 are necessary to derive the mass of its outer disk .",
