    "clusters of galaxies are the largest self - gravitating systems in the universe , and x - ray observations have revealed characteristics of intracluster medium ( icm ) which carries @xmath19% mass of known baryons , such as temperature , icm mass , and metals therein",
    ". however , the icm emission has been detectable only to @xmath20 times the virial radius @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to limited sensitivities of detectors .",
    "this means @xmath22% of an entire cluster volume has been unexplored in x - rays .",
    "according to the hierarchical structure formation scenario based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , mass accretion flows onto clusters , in particular , along filamentary structures , are still on - going .",
    "the icm in the cluster outskirts , therefore , is expected to be sensitive to the structure formation and cluster evolution . however , since the x - ray data around the virial radius of most clusters were unavailable , we have not yet known the icm characteristics in detail , such as density , temperature , pressure and entropy .",
    "the icm around the virial radius is a fascinating frontier for x - ray observations .    in the era of _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite , detection of the icm beyond 0.6 @xmath21 has become possible thanks to low and stable particle background of the xis detectors @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite measured temperature profile of abell  2044 out to @xmath23 , a radius within which the mean cluster mass density is 200 times the cosmic critical density , and found that the profile is in good agreement with hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "@xcite determined radial profiles of density , temperature , entropy , gas fraction , and mass up to @xmath24 mpc of pks  0745 - 191 , and found that the temperature profile deviates from that expected from the icm in hydrostatic equilibrium with a universal mass density profile as found by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw profile ) .",
    "@xcite also detected x - ray emission to @xmath23 and found evidence for departure from hydrostatic equilibrium at radii as small as @xmath25 mpc ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xcite obtained metallicity of the icm up to the cluster virial radii for the first time from a link region between the galaxy clusters abell  399 and abell  401 .",
    "a gravitational lensing study is complementary to x - ray measurements , because lensing observables do not require any assumptions on the cluster dynamical states .",
    "the huge cluster mass distorts shapes of background galaxy images due to differential deflection of light paths , in a coherent pattern . as a result , multiple images , arcs and einstein rings caused by the strong gravitational field of a cluster , appear around the cluster center , which is so - called strong gravitational lensing effect .",
    "it is capable of measuring mass distributions of a cluster central region very well . outside the core ,",
    "weak gravitational lensing analysis , which utilizes the coherent distortions in a statistical way , is a powerful tool to constrain the mass distribution out to the virial radius . in particular ,",
    "the _ subaru / suprime - cam _ is the best instrument to conduct the weak lensing analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , thanks to its high photon - collecting power and high imaging quality , combined with a wide field - of - view .",
    "since the strong lensing analysis is complementary to weak lensing one , a joint analysis enables us to determine accurately the cluster mass profile from the center to the virial radius .",
    "pioneer joint strong and weak lensing studies on abell  1689 @xcite have shown that observed lensing profile is well fitted by an nfw mass profile with a high concentration parameter which is defined as a ratio of the virial radius to the scaled radius .",
    "therefore , one of the best targets for the study of the icm out to cluster outskirts is abell  1689 .",
    "comparisons of x - ray observables with the well - determined lensing mass would allow us to conduct a powerful diagnostic of the icm states , including a stringent test for hydrostatic equilibrium , for the first time .",
    "in addition , two mass measurements using x - ray and lensing analysis are of vital importance to understand the systematic measurement bias and construct well - calibrated cluster mass , which will improve the accuracy of determining cosmological parameters using a mass function of galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the pointings were coordinated so that the x - ray emission centroid of abell  1689 was located at one corner of each pointing and the entire field - of - view ( fov ) of the xis covered the icm emission up to the virial radius ( @xmath33 mpc , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    ", we estimate the x - ray background ( xrb ) around abell  1689 which is crucial to detect weak signals from the icm around the virial radius .",
    "in order to estimate the x - ray background ( xrb ) , we selected the nearest two blank - sky _ suzaku _ observations to abell  1689 ; one is q1334 - 0033 ( observation i d = 702067010 , hereafter q1334 ) which is @xmath48 offset from abell  1689 , and the other is ngc4636_galactic_1 ( observation i d = 802039010 , hereafter n4636_gal ) which is @xmath49 offset from abell  1689 .",
    "the exposures are 12 ks and 35 ks for q1334 and ngc4636_gal , respectively , after the event processing and screening which are the same as those described in   [ subsection : obs : reduction ] .    the hydrogen column densities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* weighted average over @xmath40 cone radius ) of abell  1689 , q1334 , and n4636_gal , are @xmath39 @xmath37 , @xmath50 @xmath37 , and @xmath51 @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "they are in good agreement with one another within 11% , suggesting the same level of x - ray background in soft x - ray band .",
    "next we checked the count rates obtained from rosat all sky survey ( rass ) which are available via the nasa s heasarc website .",
    "since the rass count rates in the direction of abell  1689 is contaminated by its own icm emission , we took an annular region around abell  1689 of which inner and outer radii are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the rass count rates of the two blank - sky fields were defined as circular regions of @xmath40 radius . as shown in table  [ table : rass - cnt ] , the count rates of q1334 and n4636_gal match those of the annular abell  1689 field within errors in all the energy bands , except for count rates of 1/4 kev and 3/4 kev bands in the n4636_gal field , which are significantly higher than the corresponding rates in the abell  1689 field .",
    "therefore , the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) of abell  1689 is considered to be represented well by both q1334 and n4636_gal observations , while galactic foreground emission ( gfe ) should be represented only by the q1334 observation .",
    "thus , in the following spectral analyses , we ignored spectra of n4636_gal below @xmath54 kev .      using xspec12 version 12.5.0ac , we fitted nxb - subtracted xis - fi ( averaged over xis0 and xis3 ) and xis - bi spectra of q1334 and n4636_gal simultaneously with a model which represents the cxb and gfe emissions .",

    "the input image for the arfs is uniform emission over a circular region of @xmath55 radius . as the cxb model",
    ", we used a power law with a fixed photon index of 1.41 @xcite and a free normalization . to represent the gfe , we employed a model of @xcite , which consists of three _ apec _",
    "@xcite components ; a non - absorbed 0.08 kev component , an absorbed 0.11 kev one , and an absorbed 0.27 kev one , representing the emission from the local bubble ( lb ) , cool halo , and hot halo , respectively .",
    "the three _ apec _ temperatures were all fixed .",
    "the hydrogen column density was fixed to the galatic values of @xmath50  @xmath37 and @xmath51  @xmath37 for q1334 and n4636_gal , respectively .",
    "the metal abundance and redshift were also fixed to one solar and zero , respectively .",
    "relative normalizations of the two halo components were tied as cool halo : hot halo @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "thus , the gfe model has only two free parameters ; normalizations of the lb and halo .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : bgd_fit ] , this cxb+gfe model reproduces the blank - sky spectra successfully .",
    "the fitting result is summarized in table  [ table : fit - bgd ] .",
    "the 2.010.0 kev surface brightness of the cxb component is @xmath57 erg s@xmath58 @xmath37 sr@xmath58 ( 90% statistical and systematic errors ) , where the systematic error , 10% , refers to appendix 1 of @xcite .",

    "in order to see how far the icm emission of abell  1689 is detected , we made a surface brightness profile from the 0.510 kev xis - fi ( xis0 @xmath60 xis3 ) mosaic image ( figure  [ fig : mosaic ] ) .",
    "the center was chosen to be ( @xmath61 , @xmath62)=(@xmath63 ) in j2000 coordinates as a position of x - ray emission centroid in a 0.510 kev _ xmm - newton _ mos1 image .",
    "this position is close to the brightest - cluster galaxy , maxbcg  j197.87292 - 01.34110  bcg , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 kpc ) offset from the center .",
    "we identified point sources from the mos1 image using ` ewavelet ` task of the sas software version 8.0.0 with a detection threshold set at 7@xmath66 .",
    "as to point sources outside the mos1 image , we selected visible sources in a full band image of rosat pspc of which flux limit corresponds to @xmath67 erg s@xmath58 in 2.010.0 kev .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] ( right ) , circular regions ( @xmath68 in radius ) around 49 point sources were masked in the xis - fi mosaic image ( their positions and flux are summarized in table  [ table : pntsrc ] in appendix  b ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : prof_all ] , we show 0.52 kev and 210 kev raw ( background inclusive , but point - source excluded ) surface brightness profiles as black crosses .",
    "we created corresponding 0.52 kev and 210 kev nxb profiles from an nxb mosaic image with ` xisnxbgen ` .",
    "the 0.52 kev and 210 kev nxb profiles are shown in magenta in figure  [ fig : prof_all ] .",
    "then , we obtained an xrb mosaic image .",
    "based on the cxb and gfe models of abell  1689 described in ",
    "[ subsection : bgd : ana ] , we simulated xrb ( cxb+gfe ) images of the four offset observations using ` xissim ` with exposures 10 times longer than those of actual observations . the 0.52 kev and 210 kev xrb profiles are shown in green in figure  [ fig : prof_all ] . the cxb level of abell  1689 is not the same as that of the blank - sky fields because point sources are excluded in abell  1689 .",
    "therefore , intensity of the cxb model when the flux is integrated to our flux limit , @xmath69 erg s@xmath58 in 2.010.0 kev , was calculated from equation 6 of @xcite , and used in the simulation .",
    "the resulting cxb intensity of abell  1689 is 65% of the absolute cxb intensity .",
    "finally , we obtained a background - subtracted profile ( black @xmath70 magenta @xmath70 green in figure  [ fig : prof_all ] ) , as shown in red in figure  [ fig : prof_all ] . in the error bars in this background - subtracted profile ( red crosses ) , 1@xmath66 uncertainties of the xrb and nxb are added in quadrature to the corresponding statistical 1@xmath66 errors .",
    "we adopted 3.6% as the @xmath71 uncertainty of nxb @xcite , while that of xrb was calculated from @xmath71 statistical errors of normalizations in the cxb and gfe models , determined from the spectral fitting of blank sky observations (   [ subsection : bgd : ana ] ) .",
    "these are 2.1% and 15.8% for the cxb and the gfe , respectively , corresponding to 8.5% of 0.510 kev xrb flux . as a result ,",
    "the background - subtracted profiles both in 0.52 kev and 210 kev bands extend up to the virial radius ( @xmath33 mpc ) .",
    "however , as we see in ",
    "[ subsection : ana : syserr ] , more careful treatment of uncertainties related to a rather broad _ suzaku _ point spread function ( psf ) , @xmath72 in half power diameter ( hereafter hpd ) , is needed to evaluate the significance of the signal around the virial radius .",
    "the signals around the virial radius found in the x - ray surface brightness profile ( red crosses in figure  [ fig : prof_all ] ) have to be tested for systematic uncertainties caused by ( 1 ) contaminated signals from inner icm emission , and ( 2 ) residual signals from the excluded point sources .    as for the item ( 1 ) , significant amount of signals from inner regions of the icm is expected to contaminate the signal around the virial radius , since the psf of _ suzaku _ is @xmath72 in hpd @xcite . however , as described in detail in appendix  a , the simulated double - beta profile determined from the 0.510 kev _ xmm - newton _ mos1 image (   [ subsection : obs : reduction ] ) is consistent with the observed profile , and the contaminated signals which originate inside @xmath73 contributes only 22% of signals outside @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the signal observed around the virial radius can not be explained by the contaminated signals from the inner icm emission .",
    "the item ( 2 ) is also due to the @xmath74 hpd of _",
    "suzaku_. although we excluded circular regions around the point sources , half of signals from point sources is expected to escape from the excluded circular regions of @xmath68 radius .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : pntsrc_prof ] , we simulated this residual signals from point sources .",
    "details of the simulation are described in appendix  b. in 0.52 kev band , the contribution of the point sources in the @xmath75@xmath76 region is only 26% of the observed profile . meanwhile",
    ", the observed 210 kev profile can be explained well by the point sources .    by combining the contributions of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ,",
    "we conclude that in 0.52 kev band , these effects explain at most 48% of the signal around the virial radius ( @xmath75@xmath76 ) , and the detection is significant at 4.0@xmath66 level . on the other hand , in 210 kev range ,",
    "the signal is not significant .",
    "this indicates that the detected icm temperature around the virial radius might be low , compared with the central temperature of @xmath77 kev @xcite . in table",
    "[ table : significance ] , we show signal significances when x - ray surface brightness profiles are evaluated separately for the four pointing directions . in the offset1 direction ( northeast ) , the signal in 210 kev band is also detected with @xmath78 level , suggesting harder spectrum in this direction .",
    "since we surely detected the icm emission out to the virial radius from the analysis of x - ray surface brightness , we proceeded to spectral analysis .",
    "for each pointing ( offset1 through offset4 ) , we divided the xis image ( figure  [ fig : mosaic ] ) to five concentric annular regions centered on the x - ray emission centroid (   [ subsection : ana : sb ] ) ; their inner and outer radii are @xmath79@xmath80 , @xmath80@xmath81 , @xmath81@xmath82 , @xmath82@xmath75 , and @xmath75@xmath76 .",
    "we have four azimuthal regions at the same distance from the center .",
    "the 49 point sources were masked by circles of @xmath68 radius as we did in obtaining the x - ray surface brightness profile (   [ subsection : ana : sb ] ) . after extracting spectra of the xis0 , xis1 , and xis3 from each region",

    "all spectra of offset1 , an xis - fi spectrum of offset2 , and an xis - bi spectrum of offset4 are unavailable because regions irradiated by the calibration source are removed from the analysis .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] , we used xspec12 version 12.5.0ac and included the xis - fi and xis - bi spectra from the regions at the same distance , and corresponding nxb and response ( rmf and arf ) files created through the procedure described in   [ subsection : obs : reduction ] . in @xmath75@xmath76 analysis , for example , we included four xis - fi source spectra and four xis - bi source spectra . in order to determine the xrb",
    ", we also included the spectra of blank - sky fields ( figure  [ fig : bgd_fit ] ) with their nxb and response files (   [ subsection : bgd : ana ] ) .",

    "free parameters in the _ apec _ model are temperature , metal abundance , and normalization .",
    "the hydrogen column density was fixed to the galactic value of @xmath39 @xmath37 and redshift was also fixed to 0.1832 .",
    "these free parameters for different pointings ( offset1 through offset4 ) were determined separately when we saw azimuthal differences , or tied when we obtained azimuthal averages .",
    "relative normalization between the xis - fi and xis - bi was left free and its deviations from unity were within @xmath84% in all the regions .",
    "the fitting result is summarized in table  [ table : fit - result ] .",
    "although the x - ray background model is determined separately for the individual annular regions , the normalizations of cxb , lb , and halo are consistent among the regions within errors . in this spectral analysis , we did not explicitly include the two uncertainties described in ",
    "[ subsection : ana : syserr ] , namely , contaminated signals from inner icm emission and residual signals from the excluded point sources .",

    "although the temperature profile is a projected one obtained by the two - dimensional spectral analysis , it coincides well with a three - dimensional temperature profile obtained with _",
    "data @xcite in the overlapping region .",
    "the temperature is @xmath90 kev within @xmath81 ( @xmath91 kpc ) , and it gradually decreases toward the outskirts down to @xmath92 kev around the virial radius ( @xmath93 mpc ) .",
    "the decrease of temperature is independent of the azimuthal directions up to @xmath94 , at which the mean interior density is @xmath95 times the critical mass density of the universe .",
    "note that the overdensity radius @xmath14 is determined by lensing analysis , as is the case for @xmath21 ( see  [ sec : joint ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : viral ] ) ) .",
    "the logarithmic slopes of temperature between the third and forth bins , corresponding to @xmath7 are @xmath96 for all , offset1 and offset234 directions , respectively , which are consistent within errors with each other .",
    "the temperature variations in direction becomes significant in the outskirts of @xmath3 : the temperatures for offset1 ( @xmath4kev ) and offset234 ( @xmath97kev ) are about half and one - sixth of a mean temperature @xmath98 kev , which is an emission - weighted temperature of @xmath80@xmath81 and @xmath81@xmath82 regions , respectively .",
    "this temperature variations can be seen directly in spectra . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec - compbgd ] , we show the spectra of offset1 and offset2 in @xmath75@xmath76 region . the signal of offset1 is clearly detected from both xis - fi and xis - bi in @xmath99@xmath100 kev range , whereas the signal of offset2 is comparable to the background in the same energy range .",
    "this means that the xis spectra of offset1 is harder than those of offset2 , resulting in the higher temperature in the offset1 direction .",
    "the logarithmic slopes of temperature in the outskirts corresponding to @xmath3 are @xmath101 for all , offset1 and offset234 directions , respectively .",
    "the slope in offset234 and all directions are surprisingly steep .    contaminated signals from the inner icm emission due to the _ suzaku _ psf may affect the temperature determination .",
    "however , in pks  0745 - 191 case @xcite , the effect is at most @xmath102 kev even in a central region where @xmath103% of photons come from the other regions . in the other regions where photon mixing is @xmath104% , the temperature uncertainties are @xmath105 kev .",
    "therefore , in our case of abell  1689 , we expect that the psf effect is at most @xmath106 kev in the cluster outskirts outside @xmath107 , which is much smaller than the statistical errors",
    ". the effect inside @xmath107 would be also negligible because our temperature profile is consistent with the _ chandra _ result @xcite as described above . in order to see the other effect , the residual signals from the excluded point sources in @xmath75@xmath76 , we added a power - law of photon index 1.4 into the fit with its normalization fixed to the summed escaped flux of the 49 excluded point sources .",
    "this corresponds to increasing the cxb level by @xmath108 . as a result ,",
    "the effect was as small as @xmath109 kev in all the azimuthal directions , which is also smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "we compared our temperature profiles with that based on the scaled temperatures derived from a sample of 15 clusters by @xcite .",

    "it is also referred to as _ virial shocks _ @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the accretion flow along filamentary structures forms internal shocks inside the virial radius .",
    "these shocks migrate relatively deep into a cluster potential well , because a large amount of matter , such as gas , galaxies and groups , accretes from filaments @xcite .",
    "therefore , the thermalization in the outskirts along the direction of filamentary structure takes place faster .",

    "<S> faint x - ray emission from the icm around the virial radius ( @xmath1 ) is detected at @xmath2 significance , thanks to low and stable x - ray background of _ suzaku_. the _ suzaku _ observations reveal anisotropic gas temperature and entropy distributions in cluster outskirts of @xmath3 correlated with large - scale structure of galaxies in a photometric redshift slice around the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature ( @xmath4kev ) and entropy region in the northeastern ( ne ) outskirts is apparently connected to an overdense filamentary structure of galaxies outside the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the gas temperature and entropy profiles in the ne direction are in good agreement , out to the virial radius , with that expected from a recent _ xmm - newton _ statistical study and with an accretion shock heating model of the icm , respectively . to the contrary , the other outskirt regions in contact with low density void environments have low gas temperatures ( @xmath5kev ) and entropies , deviating from hydrostatic equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> these anisotropic icm features associated with large - scale structure environments suggest that the thermalization of the icm occurs faster along overdense filamentary structures than along low - density void regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the icm density distribution is fairly isotropic , with a three - dimentional density slope of @xmath6 in the radial range of @xmath7 , and with @xmath8 in @xmath3 , which however is significantly shallower than the navarro , frenk , & white universal matter density profile in the outskirts , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> a joint x - ray and lensing analysis shows that the hydrostatic mass is lower than spherical lensing one ( @xmath10 ) but comparable to a triaxial halo mass within errors , at intermediate radii of @xmath11 . on the other hand , the hydrostatic mass within @xmath12 is significantly biased as low as @xmath13 , irrespective of mass models . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal gas pressure within @xmath14 is , at most , @xmath15@xmath16 of the total pressure to balance fully the gravity of the spherical lensing mass , and @xmath17@xmath18 around the virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> although these constitute lower limits when one considers the possible halo triaxiality , these small relative contributions of thermal pressure would require additional sources of pressure , such as bulk and/or turbulent motions . </S>"
