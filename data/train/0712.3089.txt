    "during recent years neutrino detectors , notably icecube and antares , as well as large air showers arrays , such as the pierre auger observatory and the telescope array , have been advancing or completing their construction .",
    "these large detectors are sensitive to an energy region in which contributions from prompt charm decays in cosmic ray showers can not be neglected and may constitute an interesting signal as well as a significant background . in the case of searches for diffuse fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos in neutrino telescopes ,",
    "the signal must to be separated at high energies from the background of atmospheric neutrinos .    atmospheric neutrinos from @xmath1 and k meson decays",
    ", whose spectrum approximately follows the power law @xmath2 above 100gev , can be rejected using cuts on energy - correlated variables .",
    "however , the spectrum of prompt neutrinos is expected to be harder and correspond to the primary cosmic ray spectrum , since charmed mesons tend to decay promptly without interacting in the atmosphere ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , this contribution needs to be known and separated from the signal , which is generally assumed to follow a power law of @xmath3 , characteristic of fermi acceleration processes @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to achieve a precise understanding of the expected charm - induced lepton flux and angular distribution , in order to identify it in the data above 100 - 1pev , where the contribution of the softer component from light meson decays becomes negligible .",
    "for this purpose , the entire air shower needs to be simulated .",
    "one of the most widely used cosmic ray shower simulation software packages in high - energy astrophysics is corsika @xcite .",
    "it offers the user the choice between several high - energy hadronic jet simulations but does not yet officially support propagation and decay of charmed particles . in order to remedy this situation , first the viability of one of the available models for simulation of charm has to be demonstrated .",
    "the consistency of charm simulation with experiment was first verified in 1995 using the standalone version of dpmjet@xcite .",
    "the best available measurements at the time were those from the lebc hydrogen bubble chamber that took data at cern and fermilab during the late 1980s using proton beams of 400gev and 800gev , respectively @xcite . since then , a significant amount of new experiments have taken place , most notably in fixed - target runs at fermilab , but also using various types of colliders and most recently the hera - b detector at desy @xcite . in this work , the version of dpmjet integrated in corsika was used , running in first - interaction mode .",
    "this was done to directly evaluate its applicability to air shower simulation and to ensure compatibility with the standalone version .",
    "there are two mechanisms in any model for hadron production : soft particle production and hard collisions .",
    "both components are part of the dpmjet hadron production models used in this work .",
    "soft hadron production can not be rigorously derived from qcd , the gauge field theory of strong interactions .",
    "most theoretical efforts use regge theory for a systematic description of soft hadron production .",
    "the so  called _ hard _ component of particle production can be derived from perturbative qcd .",
    "qcd perturbation theory within the qcd improved parton model can only be applied at moderately large transverse momenta ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "one feature of soft hadron production at small @xmath4 values is represented by exponentially decreasing transverse momentum distributions .",
    "the qcd improved parton model predicts another component of the transverse momentum distributions , decreasing like a power law , and thus less steeply than an exponential function , at large @xmath4 .    the dual parton model * dpm * @xcite and the closely related quark gluon strings model * qgsm * @xcite construct hadron production from fragmenting strings . here",
    "we will describe the structure of this mechanism in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "since it is not possible to describe soft component of hadron physics using perturbative qcd , t hooft introduced a new expansion parameter @xcite .",
    "first , qcd is generalized from the gauge group su(3 ) to su(@xmath5 ) with @xmath5 representing the number of quark `` colours '' .",
    "the idea was to use @xmath6 as an artificial expansion parameter , and later set @xmath5 = 3 for physical applications .",
    "one then finds that the feynman graphs can be characterized by a two - dimensional surface , and the feynman expansion can be regrouped as a sum over surface topologies .",
    "the leading order corresponds to planar graphs , the next order for 2-to-2 amplitudes involves a cylindrical topology .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the terms of this topological expansion and the terms of reggeon field theory * rft*@xcite .",
    "the second theoretical concept entering dpm is duality @xcite and the dual topological unitarization * dtu*@xcite",
    ". the third ingredient of dpm is the coloured parton model .",
    "the leading contribution to soft hadron production in the dpm corresponds to the production of two chains .",
    "the two chains arise from the unitarity cut of the pomeron exchange diagram .",
    "located at the end of either chain are the valence quarks and diquarks of the two protons .",
    "the valence diquarks have anti - triplet colour , while the colliding protons as well as the two produced chains are colour neutral .",
    "particle production occurs via fragmentation of the two quark - diquark chains . in order to arrive at a quantitative model",
    ", we have to specify the probability @xmath7 that the interaction separates the proton into a valence quark with momentum fraction @xmath8 and a valence diquark with the remaining momentum fraction @xmath9 .",
    "these longitudinal momentum fractions are given by regge asymptotics .",
    "valence quarks in baryons as well as in mesons follow @xmath10 , valence diquarks in baryons @xmath11 and sea quarks @xmath12 distributions . combining these , we obtain for the distribution in a proton @xmath13 and in a meson ( valence quarks follow the same distribution as their corresponding antiparticles ) @xmath14 where the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 normalize the distributions to unity .",
    "this two - chain model already describes hadron production at low energies quite successfully .",
    "many monte carlo models therefore started with two - chain models .",
    "however , at higher energies more and more discrepancies between the model and experimental data appear .",
    "one example is that the measured transverse momentum distributions can only be explained by including a hard component in the hadron production .",
    "also , from a theoretical point of view , the pomeron total cross section ( using the so - called supercritical pomeron ) violates the unitarity principle .",
    "therefore , the model has to be unitarized .",
    "the dtujet@xcite and phojet@xcite monte carlo models use an eikonal unitarization scheme .",
    "dtujet and phojet , respectively , are used for the elementary interactions in dpmjet - ii and dpmjet - iii .",
    "both models have multiple soft and hard chains as demanded by the unitarization method .",
    "dpmjet - ii @xcite and dpmjet - iii @xcite use the glauber model to describe hadron  nucleus and nucleus  nucleus collisions . here , we will not present any details about the glauber model and refer the reader instead to the original publications cited above .      the paper by battistoni et al .",
    "@xcite gives the first description of dpm charm production .",
    "they used a version interfaced to the cosmic ray cascade code hemas @xcite , which has since then been phased out .",
    "there , dpm was implemented in form of the monte carlo event generator dpmjet - ii @xcite , which itself is based on earlier work @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "hard charm production was tested against nlo perturbative calculations @xcite and differential charm production cross sections were compared to experimental data , mainly from the lebc - ehs and lebc - mps collaborations @xcite .",
    "hadronic jet simulation with dpmjet - ii is available in the corsika cosmic ray transport code @xcite .",
    "however , the official corsika version at the time dpmjet - ii was implemented had no provision for the propagation of charmed hadrons . instead",
    ", all charmed hadrons not decaying within the hadronic jet simulation itself were handled by substituting strange quarks for charm .",
    "charm production from dpmjet - ii and other jet simulations is expected to become available in the official corsika release @xcite in the near future .",
    "earlier , an unofficial modified version was provided to the authors @xcite , in which charm was no longer supressed .",
    "our work is mostly based on this version , in which however one crucial parameter was erroneously changed with respect to the original dpmjet . the comparisons with experiment shown below demonstrate both the influence of correcting this parameter and the modifications made subsequently to the main dpmjet code ( see figs .",
    "[ selex_fig ] and [ hera_fig ] ) .",
    "dpmjet - ii is also integrated in the fluka hadron cascade code @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any charm calculations using fluka - dpmjet - ii , but this might change soon .",
    "all modifications to charm production described in this paper are similarly applicable to fluka .      in dpmjet - ii",
    "there are three different mechanisms by which production of heavy flavors like charm can occur : ( i ) charmed quarks produced at the ends of hard and semihard chains ( minijets ) , ( ii ) charmed quarks produced at the ends of soft sea chains and ( iii ) charm production inside the chain decay . only the first mechanism ( i )",
    "is founded on the solid theoretical basis of perturbative qcd , the other two mechanisms are phenomenological models used for charm and prompt muon production within cosmic ray - induced cascades      regarding this component , nothing in dpmjet - ii was changed with respect to the older version described in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not need to repeat the details given there .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that in that work a detailed comparison was presented between the results of the dpmjet - ii monte carlo at large transverse momenta and the corresponding nlo qcd calculations , showing excellent agreement between the two . for hadronic and nuclear collisions at laboratory energies beyond the tev range ,",
    "this is the dominant mechanism of charm production .",
    "in dpmjet , charm production at the end of soft sea chains is considered as the non - perturbative limit of minijets .",
    "the parton transverse momentum distributions of minijets and soft sea chains are joined smoothly at the threshold transverse momentum between the two .",
    "a certain fraction of the soft sea chain ends carry heavy flavors . at high energies ,",
    "the probability @xmath17 for production of a @xmath18 sea quark pair approaches the corresponding value for semi - hard chains , while at low energies @xmath17 decreases as required by phenomenological considerations .",
    "dpmjet uses @xmath19 with @xmath20 an additional constraint is given by the requirement that @xmath17 should not exceed the corresponding probability for minijets .",
    "dpmjet  ii uses the lund model pythia for chain fragmentation @xcite . within this model , a quark - antiquark pair @xmath21 leading to string breakup",
    "is produced via quantum mechanical tunneling .",
    "the tunneling probability can be worked out as function of the transverse mass @xmath22 of the pair @xcite , with the result that @xmath18 pair production is highly supressed : @xmath23:@xmath24:@xmath25:@xmath18 = 1 : 1 : 0.3 : 10@xmath26 .",
    "there are other models for string fragmentation with larger @xmath18 production probabilities , but none in which charm production inside the soft chain could not be neglected .    in dpmjet",
    " ii the picture remains the same , with one exception : the @xmath27 probability near a valence diquark at the end of a diquark - quark or diquark - antidiquark chain is not negligible .",
    "this effect was demonstated in hadroproduction by fixed target experiments such as selex @xcite .",
    "the leading particle shares a valence quark with the incident hadron , while the non - leading one does not .",
    "therefore leading particles are copiously produced at large @xmath28 in the forward region of the incident hadron , resulting in an asymmetry between leading and non - leading particles .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as _ leading quark effect _",
    "selex finds in the fragmentation region of protons and @xmath29 hyperons @xmath30 charmed hyperons with a comparatively flat feynman - x ( @xmath28 ) distribution . in a fit to @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 is about 2.5 . without a new mechanism",
    ", dpmjet generates this distribution with an @xmath32 of about 7 .",
    "better agreement with selex can be achieved by introducing , adjacent to a diquark , @xmath18 pairs with increased probability . in order to retain the standard pythia code ,",
    "this change was done in a special routine of dpmjet - ii .",
    "the comparison of selex data and the modified version of dpmjet is shown in section 3.3 .",
    "in dpmjet , nuclear collisions are treated with a monte - carlo formulation of the glauber model @xcite .",
    "this model contains two important numbers : the number of participants @xmath33 and the total number of collisions @xmath34 .",
    "soft particle production scales rather well with @xmath33 , whereas hard particle production ( for instance at large @xmath4 ) scales with @xmath34 .",
    "the latter phenomenon is commonly referred to as _",
    "collision scaling_. all charm production , because of the large mass difference of the quarks involved , is expected to follow collision scaling .",
    "this behaviour can be reproduced in experimental data .",

    "since this is difficult to achieve in collider experiments , relevant data are almost exclusively provided by fixed - target setups . in the past",
    ", various experiements have been conducted using different types of particle beams . in the following",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the discussion of results that were obtained with proton beams . even though statistics for proton - nucleus interactions are relatively low compared to those for meson beams @xcite , these are the processes that are the most relevant in cosmic ray - induced air showers .",
    "moreover , we consider data in the low @xmath4 region most relevant for air showers .",
    "figure [ lebc_fig ] shows the simplest case , a proton beam impinging on hydrogen nuclei in the lebc bubble chamber .",
    "these results were already used in the first comparison between dpmjet and experimental data in 1995 @xcite .",
    "taking into account the limited statistics going into the experimental result , agreement between experiment and simulation is satisfactory .",
    "an important aspect of charm hadroproduction is the leading quark effect described in section [ sec - selex ] , by which production of hadrons which share a common diquark with the incoming projectile is favored .",
    "the extent of this effect has been demonstrated by the selex colaboration using beams of protons , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the forward @xmath48 region ,",
    "production of @xmath53 was found to be significantly enhanced over its antiparticle for p and @xmath58 beams , whereas for the @xmath57 beam no asymmetry was observed .",
    "including this effect in the latest vesion of dpmjet leads to good agreement with the experimental result , as shown in figure [ selex_fig ] .",
    "since the original publication only gave absolute event numbers @xcite , and no value for the charm production cross section was published by the collaboration , in figure [ selex_fig ] an additional systematic error was added to the experimental result in order to account for uncertainties in the estimate . in @xcite , the value for @xmath52 production",
    "was found to be @xmath59 which together with the fraction of @xmath52 to total open charm @xmath60 and the total open charm production cross section from @xcite @xmath61 results in an estimate for the charm production at selex energies ( @xmath62 ) as @xmath63 .",
    "this is consistent with the value obtained from simulating charm production in dpmjet ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "finally , the simulation was compared to data from hera - b @xcite .",
    "even though the kinematic region covered by the detector was limited to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the result represents the most accurate measurement of open charm production using a proton beam .",
    "figure [ hera_fig ] shows the comparison with our simulation .",
    "even though there appear to be slight discrepancies in the individual data points , the result from dpmjet agrees well with the fit to the data presented by the hera collaboration in their publication in summer 2007 .",
    "selex used a mixture of copper and carbon targets , and hera - b alternated between carbon , titanium and tungsten . in each case , the target thickness was a small fraction of the proton interaction length . to simplify the simulation , in dpmjet nitrogen nuclei",
    "were used as target material .",
    "this is legitimized by the fact that , as noted above , collision scaling was verified both in experiment and simulation .",
    "the individual diagrams have been scaled to represent the cross section values per nucleon .",
    "charm production in dpmjet has been checked against experimental data from both fixed target and collider experiments .",
    "since the primary purpose of dpmjet is simulation of cosmic ray - induced air showers , the comparison was restricted to proton - nucleon interactions at low @xmath4 , which however represent the by far dominant contribution to charm production .",
    "the total open charm cross section is consistent with experimental values , even though systematic errors on measurements are very large , especially at high energies .",
    "comparison of simulation to differential distributions from fixed - target experiments show reasonable agreement .",
    "since 1995 , new data have become available that show hard collisions playing a much larger role than previously assumed .",
    "those results , most notably from the selex collaboration concerning charmed baryon asymmetries , but also collision scaling in @xmath18 production , were incorporated into the code .    in summary ,",
    "charm production in dpmjet has been updated reflecting the latest experimental results and is now consistent with all available measurements .",
    "all simulations have been performed with the dpmjet version integrated in the corsika air - shower simulation package .",
    "it thus allows for the first time to generate monte - carlo simulations of the prompt component in cosmic ray air showers .",
    "the precise effect of prompt contributions on muon and neutrino fluxes , as well as a study of meson - nucleon collisions , will be subject of a later paper .",
