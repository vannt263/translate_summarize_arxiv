    "<S> the calculation scales linearly with the number of principal layers @xmath0 in the scattering region and as the cube of the number of atoms @xmath1 in the lateral supercell . for metallic systems for which the required brillouin zone sampling decreases as @xmath1 increases , </S>",
    "<S> the final scaling goes as @xmath2 . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the efficient basis set allows scattering regions for which @xmath3 to be handled . </S>",
    "<S> the method is illustrated for co / cu multilayers and single interfaces using large lateral supercells ( up to @xmath4 ) to model interface disorder . because the scattering states are explicitly found , `` channel decomposition '' of the interface scattering for clean and disordered interfaces can be performed . </S>"
