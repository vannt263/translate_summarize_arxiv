    "the basic source to creating positrons for high - energy electron - positron colliders is the electron - positron pair creation by hard bremsstrahlung photons produced when a powerful electron beam hits an amorphous target .",
    "one possible approach to increase the positron production efficiency is to use a crystal target as a positron emitter .",
    "if the formation length exceeds the interatomic spacing , the interference effects from all atoms within this length are important and the cross - section for the pair creation can change essentially compared with the corresponding quantities for a single atom . from the point of view of controlling the parameters of various processes in a medium , it is of interest to investigate the influence of external fields , such as acoustic waves , temperature gradient etc .",
    ", on the corresponding characteristics .",
    "our considerations of diffraction radiation , transition radiation , parametric x - radiation , channelling radiation , bremsstrahlung by high - energy electrons , have shown that the external fields can essentially change the angular - frequency characteristics of the radiation intensities .",
    "in @xcite we have investigated the influence of the hypersonic wave excited in a crystal on the process of electron - positron pair creation by high - energy photons .",
    "the case of simplest crystal with one atom in the lattice base and the sinusoidal deformation field generated by the hypersound were considered in @xcite . to have a considerable influence of the acoustic wave , high - frequency hypersound is needed .",
    "usually this type of waves is excited by high - frequency electromagnetic field through the piezoelectric effect in crystals with a complex lattice base . in @xcite",
    "we have generalized the results of @xcite for crystals with a complex base and for acoustic waves with an arbitrary profile .",
    "in particular , the numerical calculations are carried out for the quartz single crystal and for the photons of energy 100 gev .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations on the base of the formulae given in @xcite for the pair creation cross - section by the photons of energy 3.5 gev are presented in the recent paper @xcite , where the scheme of experimental setup is proposed for the corresponding measurements on the photon channel of the yerevan synchrotron .",
    "the influence of acoustic wanes to the bremsstrahlung by high - energy electrons in crystals is investigated in @xcite .",
    "consider the creation of electron - positron pairs by high - energy photons in a crystal ( see figure [ fig1 ] for the diagram of the process ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 the energies and momenta for the photon , positron , and electron respectively .",
    "when acoustic waves are excited the positions of atoms in the crystal can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4  determines the equilibrium position of an atom in the situation without the deformation , @xmath5 is the displacement of the atom caused by the acoustic field . the collective index @xmath6 enumerates the elementary cell and the superscript @xmath7 enumerates the atoms in a given cell of a crystal .",
    "we will consider displacements of the form@xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10  are the amplitude and wave vector of the acoustic wave , @xmath11 is an arbitrary function with the period @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "for a lattice with a complex cell the coordinates of the atoms can be presented in the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15  determines the positions of the atoms for one of primitive lattices , and @xmath16  are the equilibrium positions for other atoms inside @xmath6-th elementary cell with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "the cross - section for the pair creation process is presented in the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the incoherent and coherent parts of the cross - section per atom and @xmath20 is the number of atoms in the crystal .",
    "the coherent part is determined by the formula@xmath21where @xmath22 is the electron charge , @xmath23 is the number of cells in the crystal , @xmath24 is the unit cell volume for an orthogonal lattice with the lattice constants @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28@xmath29 is the reciprocal lattice vector , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the parallel and perpendicular components of the vector @xmath32 with respect to the direction of the photon momentum @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the minimum longitudinal momentum transfer , and @xmath35 is the formation length for the pair creation process . in ( [ dsigmac / de+ ] )",
    "the summation goes under the constraint @xmath36 .",
    "the function @xmath37  is the fourier - transform of the function @xmath38 : @xmath39and @xmath40 is the factor determined by the structure of the crystal lattice base , @xmath41 is the temperature dependent mean - squared amplitude of the thermal vibrations of the @xmath7-th atom .",
    "the corresponding momentum conservation is written in the form@xmath42where @xmath43 stands for the momentum transfer to the external field . formula ( [ dsigmac / de+ ] ) differs from the formula in an undeformed crystal by the replacement @xmath44 , and by an additional summation over @xmath45 with weights @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds to the presence of an additional one - dimensional superlattice with the period @xmath47 and the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath48 .",
    "as the main contribution into the cross - section comes from the terms with @xmath49 , the influence of the deformation field may be considerable if @xmath50 . combining this with the estimate that the main contribution comes from the terms for which @xmath51 , or equivalently @xmath52 , we find the condition : @xmath53 . at high energies",
    "one has @xmath54 and this condition can be consistent with the condition @xmath55 .",
    "if the photon moves in a non - oriented crystal , in formula ( [ dsigmac / de+ ] ) the summation over @xmath29  can be replaced by the integration and the pair creation cross - section coincides with that in an amorphous medium .",
    "the role of coherence effects in the pair creation cross - section is essential when the photon enters into the crystal at small angle @xmath56 with respect to a crystallographic axis ( axis @xmath57 in our consideration ) . in this case",
    "the main contribution into the coherent part of the cross - section comes from the crystallographic planes , parallel to the chosen axis which correspond to the summands with @xmath58 .",
    "the behavior of this cross - section as a function on the positron energy essentially depends on the angle @xmath59 between the projection of the photon momentum on the plane @xmath60 and @xmath61-axis ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if the photon moves far from the corresponding crystallographic planes , the summation over the perpendicular components of the reciprocal lattice vector can be replaced by the integration : @xmath62 \\int dg_{x}dg_{y}$ ] .",
    "when the photon enters into the crystal near a crystallographic plane ( @xmath59 is small ) , two cases have to be distinguished .",
    "for the first one @xmath63 , the summation over @xmath64 can be replaced by integration . under the assumption @xmath65 , the corresponding formula is further simplified to the form@xmath66 with an effective structure factor determined by the integral on the right and @xmath67 . in the second case",
    "we assume that @xmath68 .",
    "now the main contribution comes from the terms with @xmath69 and the formula for the cross - section takes the form@xmath70where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the summation goes under the condition @xmath36 .    the numerical calculations for the cross - section are carried out in the case of @xmath73 single crystal with the moliere parametrization of the atomic potentials and for the deformation field generated by the transversal sinusoidal acoustic wave of @xmath74 type with frequency @xmath75 ghz . to deal with an orthogonal lattice , we choose as an elementary cell the cell including 6 atoms of silicon and 12 atoms of oxygen ( shrauf elementary cell ) . for this choice",
    "the @xmath61 and @xmath57 axes of the orthogonal coordinate system @xmath76 coincide with the standard @xmath77 and @xmath78 axes of the quartz crystal , whereas the angle between the axes @xmath79 and @xmath80 is equal to @xmath81 .",
    "the vector of the amplitude of the displacement is directed along @xmath79-direction , @xmath82 , and the velocity is @xmath83 cm / sec .",
    "the vector determining the direction of the hypersound propagation lies in the plane @xmath84 and has the angle with the axis @xmath78 equal to @xmath85 rad . the numerical calculations for various values of the parameters in the problem show that , in dependence of the values for the parameters , the presence of the deformation field can either enhance or reduce the cross - section .",
    "this can be used to control the parameters of the positron sources for storage rings and colliders .    as an illustration of the enhancement in figure [ fig3 ] ( left panel ) we have depicted the quantity @xmath86 evaluated by formula ( dsigmac35/de+ ) as a function of the ratio @xmath87 for @xmath88 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath89 ( full curve ) .",
    "the deformation is induced by the transversal acoustic wave of the @xmath74 type with frequency 5 mhz and @xmath90 rad , @xmath91 gev .",
    "as the cross - section is symmetric under the replacement @xmath92 , we have plotted the graphs for the region @xmath93 only . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "( right panel ) the cross - section evaluated by formula ( [ dsigmac35/de+ ] ) is presented as a function of @xmath94 for the positron energy corresponding to @xmath95 .",
    "the values of the other parameters are the same as those for the left panel .",
    "note that for the chosen values of the parameters one has @xmath96 cm , whereas @xmath97 cm for the energies @xmath98 gev and , hence , @xmath99 ."
