    "this time can be measured by the decay time of the oscillations after the transition @xcite .",
    "the two parameters that determines the transition properties is the coupling rabi frequency and the chirp rate defined as @xmath99 . in the case of sinusoidal phase modulation , where @xmath100 , the chirp rate at @xmath47 is @xmath101 .",

    "it is possible to see that in the diabatic limit ( low @xmath104 ) the decay time is nearly constant and converging towards @xmath105 , while at the adiabatic limit ( high @xmath104 ) the decay is linear with @xmath104 .",

    "we can distinct clearly the functional behavior of the three eit lines for @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath60 line is not dependent upon magnetic field thus its phase is constant with a pulse every half a cycle .",
    "both @xmath61 lines are sinusoidally modulated with a cycle equal to @xmath107 and a phase of @xmath108 between them .",
    "each of these two lines behave exactly like the detuning sweep of one eit line ( with no magnetic field ) under phase modulation ( see for example fig .",
    "this feature is understandable , as applying magnetic field can be translated to detuning via the larmor frequency zeeman shift .",
    "adding a constant detuning or constant magnetic field creates a symmetric shift of the two sinusoids until reaching a field larger than @xmath109 . in this case",
    "the two sinusoids get separated and the constant pulse of @xmath60 disappears .",
    "since the two sinusoids do not intersect the interference pattern disappears .",
    "the major consequence is that measuring a constant magnetic field accurately using this method is possible only for magnetic fields with larmor frequency smaller than @xmath109 .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , the spectrum of eit under axial magnetic field creates a splitting to three sub - levels .",
    "this is certainly verified by the three pulses seen in fig .",

    "<S> the transient response of an eit media to a sudden switching @xcite as well as for ac magnetic field @xcite was explored theoretically and experimentally for various regimes . for a constant detuning </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the transients is dictated by the eit linewidth , while the frequency of the transient oscillations equals the two photon detuning @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we take both concepts of multimode eit and transient eit and combine them together . using a full mapping of the transient response as a function of the detuning we are able to show the transition from an adiabatic regime to a non - adiabatic regime . </S>",

    "<S> this linewidth is usually a few khz which is much narrower than the pressure broadened homogeneous linewidth ( @xmath29 ) and the doppler broadening ( @xmath30 ) , thus the probe two level susceptibility is effectively constant for the full modulation bandwidth as long as @xmath31 .    </S>",
