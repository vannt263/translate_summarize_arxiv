    "the high - redshift type ia supernova ( sn ia ) observations @xcite can be explained by an accelerating expansion of the present - day universe @xcite .",
    "such conclusion assumes that observed dimming of the sne ia is hardly caused by physical phenomena non - related to overall expansion of the universe as a whole ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for discussion and review ) .",
    "furthermore it is supposed that matter component of energy density in the universe @xmath2 varies with the expansion of the universe as @xmath3 ( i.e. it has practically vanishing pressure , @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 is the cosmological scale factor , while mysterious cosmic fluid ( so - called dark energy @xcite ) is describes by the equation of state @xmath6 , where @xmath7 @xcite . in the models with the cosmological constant ( @xmath8cdm )",
    "one has @xmath9 @xcite , while in general case @xmath10 may vary with time ( models with quintessence ) @xcite .",
    "even if regarding baryon component one can assume that it decreases as @xmath3 ( pressure of baryons may be neglected due to their relative small amount in the universe ) , for dark matter ( whose nature and properties can be extracted only from its gravitational action on ordinary matter ) such a dependence on the scale factor may not hold in the universe taken as a whole ( in contrast to local manifestations e.g. in large - scale structure formation , where dependence @xmath3 may survive ) . since the contribution from all baryons into the total energy density",
    "does not exceed 4 % @xcite , the evolution of the universe as a whole is determined mainly by the properties of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the models of dark energy @xcite show explicitly unusual behaviour of this component during the expansion of the universe .",
    "in the present paper we notice that the quantum model of the homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with primordial matter in the form of the uniform scalar field proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite allows to explain the observed coordinate distances to sne ia and radio galaxies ( rgs ) in wide redshift range .",
    "according to quantum model @xcite the universe can be both in quasistationary and continuum states .",
    "quasistationary states are the most interesting , since the universe in such states can be characterized by the set of standard cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction of quasistationary state as a function of @xmath5 has a sharp peak and it is concentrated mainly in the region limited by the barrier formed by the interaction between the gravitational and scalar fields",
    ". it can be normalized ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and used in calculations of expectation values of operators corresponding to observed parameters within the lifetime of the universe .",
    "if one considers the average value of the scale factor @xmath11 in the state with large quantum numbers , enumerating the states of gravitational ( @xmath12 ) and scalar ( @xmath13 ) fields , as determining the scale factor in classical approximation , then from functional equation of quantum model for the wavefunction @xcite follows the einstein - friedmann equation in terms of average values @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean total energy including the contribution from matter and radiation in the universe in the states with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and length and density are measured in units @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath20 arises in calculation of expectation value for the operator of energy density of scalar field and takes into account its kinetic and potential terms .",
    "the value @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a mass of elementary excitation of the scalar field , @xmath13 counts the number of these excitations , can be treated as a quantity of matter / energy in the universe .",

    "@xcite a conclusion is drawn that the model of dark energy with @xmath67 implying @xmath68 agrees with the recent cmb observations made by wmap as well as with the high redshift supernovae ia data .",
    "such a universe is decelerating . in our quantum model",
    "the total dark matter / energy in the states which describe only homogenized properties of the universe varies effectively as @xmath65 . in terms of general relativity",
    "it means that its negative pressure compensates for action of gravitational attraction and the universe as a whole expands at a steady speed .",
    "deviations of @xmath35 from the law ( [ 6 ] ) towards both larger and smaller distances for some supernovae can be explained by the local manifestations of quantum fluctuations of scale factor about @xmath69 which arose in the planck epoch ( @xmath70 ) due to finite widths of quasistationary states . as it is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite such fluctuations can cause the formation of nonhomogeneities of matter density which have grown with time into the observed large - scale structures in the form superclusters and clusters of galaxies , galaxies themselves etc .",
    "let us consider the influence of mentioned fluctuations on visible positions of supernovae .",
    "the position of quasistationary state @xmath71 can be determined only approximately , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the width of the state . the scale factor of the universe in the @xmath12-th state can be found only with uncertainty , @xmath75 where the deviation @xmath76 is determined by both the value @xmath77 and the time of its formation @xcite . since @xmath74 is exponentially small for the states @xmath16 ,",
    "the fluctuations @xmath77 in the early universe are the main source for @xmath78 .",
    "the calculations demonstrate that the lowest quasistationary state has the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( in dimensionless units ) .",
    "the radius of curvature is @xmath81 , while the lifetime of such a universe is @xmath82 . within the time interval @xmath83",
    "the nonzero fluctuations of scale factor with relative deviation equal e.g. to @xmath84 can be formed in the universe .",
    "such fluctuations of the scale factor cause in turn the fluctuations of energy density which can result in formation of structures with corresponding linear dimensions under the action of gravitational attraction .",
    "for example , for the current value @xmath85 cm the dimensions of large - scale fluctuations @xmath86 mpc , @xmath87 mpc , and @xmath88 mpc correspond to relative deviations ( [ 8 ] ) . on the order of magnitude these values agree with the scale of superclusters of galaxies .",
    "let us note that the probability of the fluctuations which can yield the scale of nonhomogeneities of the matter density @xmath89 mpc in visible part of the universe is small because of large probability of tunneling of the universe into the region of the continuous spectrum from the lowest state with @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "if one assumes that just the fluctuations @xmath78 cause deviations of positions of sources at high redshift from the law ( [ 6 ] ) , then it is possible to estimate the values of relative deviations @xmath92 from the observed values @xmath35 .",
    "the fluctuations of scale factor ( [ 7 ] ) generate the changes of coordinate distances , @xmath93.\\ ] ]    .relative deviations @xmath92 for some type ia supernovae [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     relative deviations @xmath92 calculated from observed coordinate distances ( central values ) for some type ia supernovae are shown in table 1 .",
    "the supernovae better described by the @xmath8cdm - model are placed in group 1 .",
    "all shown supernovae have negative relative deviations with absolute values within the limits of ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the only exception is sn 1997ck at @xmath94 .",
    "the supernova 1997ff at @xmath95 which has the coordinate distance close to the prediction of the quantum model ( [ 6 ] ) is located in group 2 .",
    "it has small positive relative deviation within the bounds of ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the sources described by the model with @xmath41 are shown in group 3 .",
    "they have positive relative deviations and their values agree with ( [ 8 ] ) as well . in group 4",
    "one can find four supernovae with coordinate distances which are not described by any above mentioned model even with the regard for observation errors .",
    "the values @xmath96 for two of them ( see table 1 ) satisfy the estimations ( [ 8 ] ) . for sne 1997ck ( group 1 ) and 1995ar ( group 4 ) the values of relative deviations with regard for uncertainty of measurements @xcite ( if one takes the lowest value ) are equal to @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively . the supernova 1997k at @xmath99",
    "is characterized by too sharp negative relative deviation even in comparison with the largest possible fluctuations of the scale factor .",
    "if one takes into account uncertainty of measurements and accept for distance the value @xmath100 @xcite then the corresponding deviation @xmath101 will still exceed the relative deviation at @xmath102 . the same analysis one can make for rgs as well .",
    "thus the observed faintness of some sne ia can in principle be explained by the logarithmic - law dependence of coordinate distance on redshift in generalized form ( [ 9 ] ) which takes into account the fluctuations of scale factor about its average value .",
    "these fluctuations can arise in the early universe and grow with time into observed deviations of the coordinate distances of separate sne ia at the high redshift .",
    "they produce accelerating or decelerating expansions of space subdomains containing such sources whereas the universe as a whole expands at a steady rate .",
    "in addition to the prediction about the steady - speed expansion of the universe as a whole ( at the same time the accelerating or decelerating motions of its subdomains remain possible on a cosmological scale as it is shown in sect . [ quan ] ) the quantum model allows an increase of quantity of matter / energy in matter dominated universe according to ( [ 3 ] ) . if the mass @xmath22 of elementary excitations of the scaler field remains unchanged during the expansion of the universe , then the increase of @xmath25 can occur due to increase in number @xmath13 of these excitations .",
    "but the increase in @xmath13 does not mean that a quantity of observed matter in some chosen volume of the universe increases . according to the model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite the observed `` real '' matter ( both luminous and dark ) is created as a result of the decay of excitations of the scalar field ( under the action of gravitational forces ) into baryons , leptons and dark matter .",
    "the undecayed part of them forms what can be called a dark energy .",
    "such a decay scheme leads to realistic estimates of the percentage of baryons , dark matter and energy in the universe with @xmath103 and @xmath104 . despite the fact that the quantity of matter / energy can increase , the mean total energy density decreases and during the expansion of the universe mainly the number of elementary excitations of the scalar field increases .",
    "their decay probability is very small , so that basically only the dark energy is created .",
    "these circumstances can explain the absence of observed events of creation of a new baryonic matter on a cosmologically significant scale .",
    "the proposed approach to the explanation of observed dimming of some sne ia may provoke objections in connection with the problem of large - scale structure formation in the universe , since the energy density @xmath61 in the form ( [ 4 ] ) can not ensure an existence of a growing mode of the density contrast @xmath105 ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as we have already mentioned above in sect .",
    "[ coor ] the density @xmath61 ( [ 4 ] ) describes only homogenized properties of the universe as a whole .",
    "it can not be used in calculations of fluctuations of energy density about the mean value @xmath61 . under the study of large - scale structure formation one",
    "should proceed from the more general expression for the energy density ( [ 2 ] ) . defining concretely the contents of matter / energy @xmath25 , as for instance in the model of creation of matter mentioned above , one can make calculations of density contrast as a function of redshift .",
    "the problem of large - scale structure formation is one of the main problems of cosmology ( see e.g. refs .",
    "it goes beyond the tasks of this paper and requires a special investigation .",
    "the ways of its solution in the quantum model are roughly outlined in ref .",
