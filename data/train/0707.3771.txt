    "centaurus a is one of the nearest group of galaxies at the mean distance of 3.77 mpc from us .",
    "the cen  a / m  83 region is particularly interesting because one of the dominant galaxies cen  a is a giant elliptical .",
    "the only other nearby large elliptical galaxy is the highly obscured maffei  1 .",
    "the cen  a group is probably more dynamically evolved than others in the local volume , like local group or m  81 group , which have a spiral galaxy as central body . at the distance of cen  a group galaxies",
    "are well resolved into individual stars including old giant branch stars up to an age of 10 to 13 gyr .",
    "the centaurus a group contain 31 members or probable members ( karachentsev 2005 , aj 129 , 178 ) .",
    "over the last several years members of our team participated in two snapshot surveys of nearby galaxies using wfpc2 aboard hst , which have provided us with the material for distances of @xmath0 accuracy for about 150 nearby galaxies ( proj .",
    "8192 and 8601 ) .",
    "further significant progress has been made with hst / acs pointed observations ( proj .",
    "9771 and 10235 ) . most of known dwarf members of the cen",
    "a / m  83 complex were imaged within the framework of these projects . here",
    "we present star formation history ( sfh ) determination from color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of resolved stars in 14 dwarf galaxies in the cen  a group ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the galaxies span absolute b magnitude range of @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "hst / acs images of these objects were taken with f606w ( broadband v ) and f814w ( broadband i ) filters .",
    "photometry of resolved stars in the galaxies was made with the dolphot package for crowded field photometry ( dolphin 2000 , pasp 112 , 1383 ) .",
    "photometric distances for all galaxies in the sample were obtained using tip of the red giant branch distance indicator ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2007 , aj 133 , 504 ) .",
    "we have created a program to analyze our large and homogeneous sample of galaxies ( makarov & makarova 2004 , ap 47 , 229 ) .",
    "we construct synthetic cmds from theoretical stellar isochrones taking into account the initial mass function , galaxy distance , galactic extinction and photometric errors .",
    "photometric uncertainties and completeness values were added using results of artificial star tests .",
    "a linear combination of synthetic cmds of different ages and metallicities forms a model cmd . for sfh determination",
    "we have to find a best linear combination of partial model cmds to match the observed data .",
    "we construct a maximum - likelihood function for this task .",
    "several star formation features can be recognized from our measurements ( see representative set in fig.3 ) .",
    "first , most galaxies demonstrate two distinct ( and similar ) star formation episodes .",
    "an ancient episode has an age of about 1013 gyr and low metal abundance .",
    "the galaxies under study also show enhanced star formation about 0.110 gyr ago .",
    "dwarf irregulars has some ongoing star formation , too .",
    "second , several dwarfs under study have unusual rate of metal enrichment , with the metallicity level of recent star formation episodes of about solar and probably higher ( like kk  197 and eso  269066 ) .",
    "possible explanation of this high enrichment level can be due to interaction and merging of some galaxies during the evolution of the cen  a group .",
    "sales et al .",
    "( astro - ph/0706.2009v3 , millennium simulations ) have demonstrated high matter spread ( up to 2 virial radii ) in such evolutionary processes .",
    "smaller members in the group can experience enhanced star formation due to these interactions and merging using the processed in larger galaxies matter of higher metal abundance ."
