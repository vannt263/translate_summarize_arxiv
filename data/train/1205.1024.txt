    "cavity polaritons are composite particles , arising from strong coupling between photonic mode of a planar semiconductor microcavity and exciton transition in quantum well ( qw ) , embedded in the cavity at the point where the electric field of the confined electromagnetic state reaches its maximum .",
    "having a hybrid half - light - half - matter nature cavity polaritons demonstrate a set of peculiar properties which make them different from other quasiparticles in solid state systems .",
    "extremely low effective mass of the cavity polaritons ( about @xmath0 of the free electron mass ) together with strong polariton - polariton interactions makes polaritonic system an ideal candidate for observation of the variety of quantum collective phenomena at surprisingly high temperatures .",
    "achievement of polariton bose - einstein condensation was first reported at @xmath1 @xcite and later on even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "later on polariton superfluidity @xcite , josephson effect @xcite and formation of topological excitations @xcite were experimentally observed .",
    "other theoretically predicted effects such as polariton self - trapping @xcite , polariton - mediated superconductivity @xcite still wait for their experimental confirmation .    .",
    "]    besides fundamental interest , quantum microcavities in the strong coupling regime can be used for optoelectronic applications @xcite . for more then a decade ,",
    "the only object of the study in this context was polariton laser @xcite- a novel type of the coherent emitter which explores the possibility of the polariton bec . in the last years , however , the emphasis became to shift on other types of the devices based on transport properties of cavity polaritons in real space .",
    "it was noticed that the peculiar spin structure of polaritons opens a way for creation of optical analogs of spintronic components ( so - called spinoptronic devices @xcite ) .",
    "with respect to optics , spin - optronics has the advantage of being able to use particle - particle interactions occurring in nanostructures and resulting in strong nonlinearities .",
    "with respect to spintronics , it has the advantage of strongly reducing the dramatic impact of carrier spin relaxation or decoherence , which has severely limited the achievement or the functionality of any working semiconductor - based spintronic devices .    in this context , the analysis of one - dimensional ( 1d ) polariton transport is of particular importance @xcite , as 1d polariton channels are fundamental building blocks of such future spinoptronic devices as polariton neurons @xcite and polariton integrated circuits @xcite",
    ". it should be noted , that current state of growth technology offers a large variety of methods of the lateral confinement of cavity polaritons @xcite and polariton quantum wires ( 1d polariton channels ) can be routinely produced .    currently , the theoretical study of transport of spinor cavity polaritons in the real space is based on the assumption of full coherence of the polaritonic system .",

    "the non - coherent processes coming from the interaction of the polaritonic system with a phonon bath in most cases are not accounted for or treated within simple phenomenological models lacking microscopic justification @xcite . on the other hand , it is clear that polariton - phonon interaction is of crucial importance , as it provides a thermalization mechanism for a polaritonic ensemble and drastically affects such experimentally observable quantities as first and second order coherencies @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , that for spatially homogeneous polariton system polariton - phonon interactions can be accounted for using a system of the semiclassical boltzmann equations @xcite .",
    "this method , however , has several serious drawbacks .",
    "first , it is based on the assumption that the system is fully incoherent , and thus variety of intriguing nonlinear phenomena such as bistability and multistability can not be described .",
    "second , it provides the information about occupation numbers in the reciprocal space only , and thus can not be used for description of the dynamics of the spatially inhomogeneous system .",
    "this makes this formalism inappropriate for modeling of spinoptronic devices based on polariton transport in real space .    in the present paper we present formalism suitable for the description of the dynamics of an inhomogeneous spinor polariton system in real space and time accounting for all relevant types of the processes .",
    "namely , we take into account polariton - polariton and polariton - phonon interactions and effective longitudinal - transverse ( te - tm ) magnetic field acting on polariton spin .",
    "our consideration is based on the lindblad approach for density matrix dynamics and represents a generalization of our previous work where spinless case was considered @xcite .",
    "we use our results for modeling of the spin dynamics of the polaritons in 1d channels , investigating the role played by decoherence at different temperatures .",
    "we describe the state of the system ( polaritons plus phonons ) by its density matrix @xmath2 , for which we apply the born approximation factorizing it into the phonon part which is supposed to be time - independent and corresponds to the thermal distribution of acoustic phonons @xmath3 and the polariton part @xmath4 whose time dependence should be determined , @xmath5 .",

    "in this case , since there is no mechanism of the transition between @xmath70 and @xmath71 modes , this effect can be understood in terms of independent bistable dynamics of @xmath70 and @xmath71 modes .",
    "accordingly , in inset we present the population hysteresis curve of a spinless polaritons to clarify the forthcoming discussion .",
    "let s begin with inset . in the certain range of pumps",
    "the polariton population can take two different values depending on the history of the pumping process .",
    "if we slowly increase the intensity of pump , at some threshold value @xmath90 the population of the ground state jumps up abruptly due to the resonance of the blue shifted polariton energy with the energy of the laser mode .",
    "the system keeps staying at this high - populated state with further increase of the pump intensity . in the backward direction ,",
    "when we decrease the intensity of pump , the bistable transition to the low - populated state appears at the lower pump intensity ( @xmath91 ) and hysteresis curve appears .    with account for spin , polariton - polariton interaction becomes polarization - dependent , which leads to multistability of the polariton circular polarization ( see ref .",
    "for the detailed discussion of the situation at @xmath92 ) .",
    "this effect is illustrated in main plot of fig .  2 for different temperatures , where the pump intensity is fixed and its circular polarization degree @xmath93 is being changed .",
    "let us explain this phenomenon with the help of above discussion for spinless case . keeping the total pump intensity",
    ", lets change its circular polarization from @xmath71 ( @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ) to @xmath70 ( @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ) , see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "initially there exists only @xmath71 polaritons in the ground state , thus @xmath98 . as @xmath93",
    "is increased , @xmath70 component starts to become more populated , and at certain threshold value of @xmath93 the first bistable jump up in @xmath99 occurs that implies the abrupt increase of the @xmath70 component .",
    "further increase of @xmath93 leads to the second jump up of the polarization degree @xmath99 due to the bistability jump down of @xmath71 component from high population state to low population state .",
    "finally the system reaches the state with only @xmath70 component and @xmath100 . in the backward direction (",
    "decrease pump polarization degree from + 1 to -1 ) the first jump down is due to the abrupt increase of @xmath71 component , while the second jump down is explained by the abrupt decrease of @xmath70 component occupancy .",
    "with increasing temperature , the multistability loops start to shrink and become totally destroyed at about @xmath101 k. it occurs due to the dissipation processes coming from interaction with acoustic phonons . at higher temperature the spin - independent polariton - phonon interaction makes the dependence @xmath102 quasi - linear , as it should be expected , indeed , in the case when coherent nonlinearities play no role and there is no transition between circular polarized components the polarization degree of the system should coincide with those of the pump .    ) for @xmath103 mev , and t=0 k. due to the finite value of the te - tm coupling , the equivalency between x and y linear polarizations is broken .",
    "therefore , the choice of meridian line of poincar sphere along which the pump laser evolves from @xmath71 to @xmath70 state becomes crucial for the polarization dynamics of the polariton system . ]",
    "now let us introduce the te - tm splitting to see its effect on polarization multistability .",
    "the corresponding term removes the isotropy in the xy plane since it acts as an effective magnetic field in + x direction .",
    "consequently , the population of each component @xmath104 becomes dependent not only on circular polarization of the pump , but also on its in - plane component as can be seen from eq .  .",
    "in fig .  3 , the dependence of the internal circular polarization degree of the system @xmath99 is plotted as a function of the circular polarization degree of the pump @xmath93 for three different in - plane angles @xmath105 between the in- plane pseudospin of the pump and direction along the wire : axis ox ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "azimuthal angle @xmath105 comes in the pumping hamiltonian as the relative phase factor between the pumping amplitudes , i.  e. @xmath106 .",
    "it is observed that relative phase drastically modifies the profile of the @xmath102 plot .",
    "first , we note that a finite y - component of the pump pseudospin ( @xmath107 ) destroys the symmetry of the multistability curve with respect to the change of the sign of circular polarization of the pump ( see dotted green line ) .",
    "also , comparing the results for @xmath108 ( + x direction ) and @xmath109 ( -x direction ) cases , we see two quite different polarization behaviors . this difference can be understood from the first term of the kinetic equation for @xmath110 , where the two cases ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) give contributions with opposite signs .",
    "therefore , the internal circular polarization degree becomes highly sensitive to the choice of meridian on the surface of the poincar sphere along which the circular polarization of the laser is changed between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it should be noted , that for circularly polarized pump the effect of rotation of pseudospin due to te - tm splitting is invisible : for the used value @xmath103 mev and circular polarized pump the effect of macroscopic self - trapping plays major role @xcite and rotation of pseudospin is blocked . for reduced values of circular polarization self - trapping regime is lost and effects of te - tm splitting become visible .     for t=100 k.",
    "thus te - tm splitting revives the bistability behavior even at high temperature values . at strong te - tm splittings , i. e. , @xmath111 mev ,",
    "the circular polarizability diminishes due to strong mixing of @xmath112 modes , and the hysteresis loop disappears . ]    let us finally analyze the combined effect of the te - tm splitting and scattering on phonons ( in the rest of the calculations the in - plane component of the pump pseudospin is taken along the + x direction , i.e. , @xmath108 ) . as it was shown before in fig .  2 , in the absence of te - tm splitting due to the dissipative nature of polariton - phonon interactions the hysteresis behavior is washed out at 100 k. on the other hand , if @xmath113 , as in fig .",
    "4 , the bistable behavior can be recovered and bistability phenomena can survive up to higher temperatures as compare to the case @xmath114 . however , instead of two - stepped hysteresis loop shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we observe only one - stepped behavior .",
    "this result suggests the transition from two - independent modes dynamics ( the two modes are the mode with @xmath70 and the mode with @xmath71 polarizations ) to a single collective mode dynamics .",
    "in fact , at some critical value of the te - tm splitting , ( around 0.1 mev in our parameter regime ) , transition from high population state to low population state of the one mode is always accompanied by the simultaneous transition from low population state to high population state of the other mode and crossover from the multistable behavior to the bistable occurs .",
    "if one increases the value of the te - tm splitting field even further , polaritons would prefer to stay in quasi - linearly polarized state due to strong mixing of @xmath112 modes , even for pumping by the fully circularly polarized laser .",
    "this situation occurs at @xmath111 mev in fig .  4 , where polaritons become highly linearly polarized even at the values of @xmath115 due to high value of the effective magnetic field in the + x direction .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "is responsible for this behavior .",
    "the particles align their pseudospin parallel to the strong effective magnetic field to minimize the total energy in the system .",
    "meanwhile , the hysteresis behavior vanishes , and the difference between the backward and forward swappings disappears .",
    "in conclusion , we developed a formalism for the description of the dissipative dynamics of an inhomogeneous spinor polariton system in real space and time accounting for polariton - polariton interactions , polariton - phonon scattering and effect of the te - tm effective magnetic field .",
    "we applied our formalism to one - dimensional polariton condensate at different temperatures to investigate the dynamics of the circular polarization of the system when it is driven by the external homogeneous laser pump .",
    "we showed that the polarization of the condensate is highly sensitive not only to the history of the strength of the pump , but also to the phase of the elliptical polarization degree of this pump . in the presence of te - tm field",
    "we observe the survival of this phenomena up to very high temperatures .",
