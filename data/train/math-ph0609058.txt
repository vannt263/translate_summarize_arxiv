    "the liouville field theory is actively studied both in physics and mathematics @xcite .",
    "several approaches have been proposed for its quantization , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite for a list of references on this subject .    motivated by the difficulties encountered in carrying out the quantization program of the liouville model posed by the exponential interaction term present in its action ,",
    "we show here the equivalence between liouville field theory and a field theory with polynomial action which describes the interaction of two scalar fields with a massive vector field .",
    "the original degrees of freedom of the liouville model are conveniently mapped into the longitudinal component of the vector field , while the spurious transverse components decouple after taking a suitable limit of large coupling constant .",
    "the appearance of the mass term of the vector field is related to the kinetic energy of the liouville field theory .",
    "the two scalar fields are instead associated to constraints , so that they do not introduce other , unwanted , degrees of freedom .",
    "the advantage of the new theory derived in this way is that it has a structure similar to that of massive scalar electrodynamics and it is thus much more tractable than liouville field theory with standard techniques , like for instance the perturbative approach  .    at the heart of the mapping of the liouville model into a polynomial field theory",
    "there is a transformation which allows to rewrite the exponential term typical of liouville field theory in the form of the generating functional of a two component scalar field theory .",
    "the price to be paid is the introduction of new degrees of freedom , however the scalar sector of the theory is almost trivial because , as already mentioned , its role is just to impose constraints .",
    "solvable theories in which the number of degrees of freedom is zero have been known for more than thirty years @xcite .",
    "the technique of expressing complicated potentials in terms of amplitudes of almost trivial field theories has been presented in ref .",

    "the mapping of liouville field theory into the two component scalar field theory coupled to a vector field is based in part on known results of the theory of brownian motion . in particular , it is applied the field theoretical representation of the grand canonical partition function of charged particles subjected to a random walk while immersed in a magnetic field .",
    "this is not the first time that liouville field theory has been related to statistical systems .",
    "for example , in the works of refs .",
    "@xcite the theory of liouville appears either like a random field or as a mean to express the normalization of the ground state of a model of disordered conductors . in @xcite",
    "it is associated to quantum chaos in anyon systems .",
    "however , the main interest of this work is not the connection between liouville field theory and statistical mechanics .",
    "the goal is instead to map the liouville field theory into a theory which is simpler in the sense that its action is a polynomial in the fields , so that field theoretical techniques like the perturbative approach can be applied to it .",
    "the statistical theory of the random walk enters in our approach because it offers a nice way to express the green function of fields coupled to vector fields , a fact already noted in ref .",
    "the application of these ideas to liouville field theory and the derivation of the equivalent model with polynomial interactions constitutes the original part of the present work .",

    "their transverse degrees of freedom decouple from the other fields and only the longitudinal component survives . in section iv the two scalar fields are integrated out from the partition function . the result is a field theory in which there is an unique scalar field with an exponential interaction term .",
    "the equivalence of this field theory with the model of liouville is proved in section v. our conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
