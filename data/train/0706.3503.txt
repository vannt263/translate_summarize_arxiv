    "in the recent progress of experimental and theoretical researches of unstable nuclei , various exotic phenomena have been discovered .",
    "as well known , one of the attractive subjects in neutron - rich nuclei is the breaking of neutron magic number such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 suggested in neutron - rich @xmath11-shell and @xmath12-shell nuclei .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath9 shell in @xmath13be has been well known for a long time because of the parity inversion of the ground state , @xmath14 . for @xmath3be ,",
    "various experimental researches have been recently achieved @xcite to study the properties of the ground band , and the breaking of @xmath9 shell closure has been established . concerning the mechanism of the @xmath9 shell breaking ,",
    "the recent observation@xcite of the significant @xmath15-wave component in the @xmath3be ground state is the direct probe for the deformation , which should be one of the essential factors for the breaking in be isotopes suggested in theoretical calculations @xcite . in the theoretical side , many kinds of microscopic calculations have been performed to investigate neutron - rich nuclei with the breaking shell closure . in case of neutron - rich",
    "be isotopes , various properties have been successfully described by many groups from a point of view of cluster ( see references in ref.@xcite ) . as a result",
    ", it is considered that molecular orbital structure with large deformation is a key for the breaking of @xmath9 magic number in neutron - rich be .    in the molecular orbital picture ,",
    "be isotopes are described by 2 @xmath16 clusters and valence neutrons which occupy the molecular orbitals formed around the @xmath17 core@xcite .",
    "the molecular orbitals are given by a linear combination of @xmath11-orbitals around the @xmath16 clusters , and they are associated with the orbitals in two - center shell model@xcite . in the spherical limit ,",
    "the negative - parity @xmath18-orbitals are the lowest for the valence neutrons . on the other hand , with the development of the @xmath17 clustering , so - called @xmath19 orbital , which is the longitudinal positive - parity orbital , comes down because its kinetic energy decreases . finally , the inversion of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 orbitals occurs in a system with well - developed @xmath17 clustering .",
    "the inversion of the molecular orbitals corresponds to the parity inversion of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals because the @xmath18 and @xmath19 orbitals in the molecular orbital model are associated with the @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals in the deformed shell model , respectively .",
    "the intruder state of @xmath3be is written by the configuration with two neutrons in the @xmath19-orbital .",
    "if the @xmath17 structure develops enough in @xmath3be , the intruder state may become the ground state .",
    "this necessarily causes the significant mixture of @xmath15-wave component , which is consistent with the recent measurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , most of the low - lying states in neutron - rich be isotopes can be well described by the molecular orbital structure@xcite , and a variety of cluster states has been predicted in excited states of @xmath13be and @xmath3be @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that cluster aspect is one of essential features in light unstable nuclei as well as in light stable nuclei .",
    "in particular , cluster structure is favored in neutron - rich be , where a variety of exotic structure arises due to the the formation of 2 @xmath16 clusters and the molecular orbitals .",
    "let us turn to structure of b isotopes , which have a proton number @xmath20 larger by one than be isotopes .",
    "in contrast to the situation of @xmath3be , @xmath0b is considered to have the normal ground state with a neutron @xmath11-shell closed configuration . comparing with the intruder configuration of the ground state in @xmath3be , this shows that the @xmath9 magic number is restored in @xmath0b due to the additional proton .",
    "thus , the additional proton gives drastic structure change of the ground state , however , it is still natural to expect that intruder states may appear in the excited states of @xmath0b .",
    "if a cluster structure can develop also in b as well as be , the intruder states may lie in low excitation energy region , because such states can be stabilized in a similar way to the ground state of @xmath3be .",
    "the intruder states may have large deformation and construct rotational bands .",
    "cluster features in neutron - rich b isotopes have been systematically studied in a chain of b isotopes with a molecular orbital model(mo ) @xcite and a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd)@xcite .",
    "these studies have been concentrated on the structure of ground states , and have shown that @xmath0b is most spherical among b isotopes , while developed cluster structure has been predicted in further neutron - rich b like @xmath21b and @xmath22b .",
    "these results suggest a trend of two - center cluster structure in @xmath20 systems .    in this paper , we investigated deformed states of @xmath0b by performing microscopic calculations of the ground and excited states of @xmath0b .",
    "we focused on their cluster aspect .",
    "in particular , the molecular orbital structure is our major interest . in the present study we applied an amd method , which is known to be a powerful approach to investigate cluster structure of unstable nuclei@xcite .",
    "the present method is the same as that applied to the studies of @xmath23be,@xmath13be , and @xmath3be@xcite .",
    "namely , we performed variation after spin - parity projection within the framework of amd@xcite .",
    "this method has been proved to successfully describe various properties of the ground and excited states of be isotopes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly explain the theoretical method of the present work .",
    "results and discussions are given in [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we give a summary in [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we performed energy variation after spin parity projection(vap ) within the amd model space , as was done in the previous studies@xcite .",
    "the detailed formulation of the amd method for nuclear structure study is described in @xcite . in particular , the formulation of the present calculations is basically the same as that described in @xcite .",
    "an amd wave function is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets ; @xmath24 where the @xmath25th single - particle wave function is written by a product of spatial(@xmath26 ) , intrinsic spin(@xmath27 ) and isospin(@xmath28 ) wave functions as , @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are spatial and spin functions , and @xmath32 is iso - spin function which is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) .",
    "we used a width parameter @xmath33 @xmath34 , which is chosen to be the optimum value for @xmath0b .",
    "accordingly , an amd wave function is expressed by a set of variational parameters , @xmath35 .    for the lowest @xmath36 state",
    ", we varied the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38(@xmath39 ) to minimize the energy expectation value of the hamiltonian , @xmath40 , for the spin - parity projected amd wave function ; @xmath41 . here",
    ", @xmath42 is the spin - parity projection operator .",
    "then we obtained the optimum solution of the parameter set ; @xmath43 for the lowest @xmath36 state .",
    "the solution @xmath44 for the @xmath45th @xmath36 state are calculated by varying @xmath46 so as to minimize the energy of the orthogonal component to the lower states .",
    "after the vap calculations for the @xmath47 states with respect to various @xmath48 , @xmath45 and @xmath49 , we obtained the optimum intrinsic wave functions , @xmath50 , which approximately describe the corresponding @xmath47 states .",
    "after the vap , we superposed the spin - parity eigen wave functions projected from all the obtained amd wave functions .",
    "namely , we determined the final wave functions for the @xmath47 states as , @xmath51 results -------    we adopted the same effective nuclear interaction as that used in the study of be isotopes @xcite , which consists of the central force , the spin - orbit force and the coulomb force .",
    "the majorana parameters in the mv1 force are @xmath52 , and the strengths of the spin - orbit force are @xmath53 mev .",
    "the vap calculations of amd using these interactions reproduce well the breaking of neutron magic number @xmath9 in @xmath13be and @xmath3be . with this interaction",
    "the calculated binding energies of @xmath3be and @xmath0b are 61.9 mev and 76.4 mev , which underestimate the experimental values , 68.6 mev and 84.5 mev , respectively , however , we adopted this parametrization because the energy levels of the excited states in @xmath23be , @xmath13be and @xmath3be are reasonably reproduced .",
    "the basis amd wave functions were obtained by the vap for the ground and excited states of @xmath0b .",
    "the number of the basis amd wave functions in the present calculations are 23 .",
    "the initial wave function in the energy variation was randomly chosen for @xmath54 states . for @xmath55 states , we started the variational calculation from the initial wave function projected from the obtained wave function @xmath56 for the @xmath57 states .",
    "these independent amd wave functions were superposed to calculate the final wave functions .",
    "@xmath0b is a nucleus with neutron magic number @xmath9 , and its ground state is the @xmath58 with normal configuration of @xmath11-shell closure . above the @xmath58 ground state of @xmath0b , it is experimentally known that many states exist in the excitation energy @xmath59 mev region with high level density .",
    "unfortunately , spins and parities of most of these states are unknown . recently",
    ", the state at 4.83 mev has been assigned to be a @xmath4 state by @xmath6he(@xmath3be,@xmath0b@xmath7)@xmath8 experiments@xcite .",
    "because of its strong production via proton - transfer to the @xmath3be(@xmath5 ) state , this excited state is suggested to be a proton intruder state .",
    "the calculated energy levels of the negative- and positive - parity states of @xmath0b are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b13spe ] .",
    "in addition to the ground @xmath60 state , we obtained many excited states with various @xmath36 in the region @xmath61 mev .",
    "these states may correspond to the observed levels in this energy region . in the excited states",
    ", we found three largely deformed bands , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath62 ( solid lines ) .",
    "these bands are composed of intruder states or well - developed cluster states .",
    "in particular , the band - head state @xmath63 of the @xmath2 is the proton intruder state with a large deformation , and hence this should be assigned to the experimental @xmath4(4.83 mev ) state .",
    "the @xmath62 band was obtained by the spin - parity projection and the diagonalization of the obtained wave functions , though the vap calculations were not performed for the corresponding @xmath47 states .",
    "this band is dominantly the @xmath16-@xmath64li cluster state .",
    "the intrinsic structures of these deformed states are discussed later in detail . as for other excited states",
    "( disconnected filled circles ) , intrinsic deformation of the major amd wave function @xmath50 , which dominates the final wave functions @xmath65 , is small or as large as normal deformation at most .",
    "these excited states are regarded to be dominated by @xmath66 or and neutron @xmath67 configurations .",
    "figure  [ fig : b13dense ] shows density distribution and deformation parameters of the major amd wave functions , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which were obtained by the vap for the corresponding @xmath47 states .",
    "the ground state ( @xmath60 ) has the most spherical shape(fig .",
    "[ fig : b13dense](b ) ) , due to the neutron @xmath11-shell closure .",
    "this is consistent with the previous work by amd @xcite . in the @xmath74 state(fig .",
    "[ fig : b13dense](a ) ) , a three - center cluster core structure appears .",
    "the core clusters are an @xmath16 with two valence neutrons , a triton and an @xmath16 .",
    "this state is approximately regarded as the @xmath75-limit cluster state though the spatial cluster development is somehow contained .",
    "the similar three - center cluster structure is found also in the @xmath76 state . in the @xmath77 and the @xmath78 states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b13dense](c ) and ( d ) ) , we found remarkably deformed structure with developed cluster cores .",
    "these states are the members of the @xmath1 band which starts from @xmath79 mev .",
    "it is interesting that such a largely deformed band appears only 5 mev above the ground state , even though this nucleus has neutron magic number @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath80 state of this band is on the yrast line .",
    "moreover , it is striking that a further large deformation arises in the @xmath63 state(fig .",
    "[ fig : b13dense](e ) ) , which is the band - head state of the @xmath2 band .",
    "the deformation @xmath81 of this state exceeds the value for superdeformation and is close to the value 0.9 for hyperdeformation . in the @xmath82 state",
    ", we obtained the well - developed cluster structure like @xmath83li+@xmath16(fig .",
    "[ fig : b13dense](f ) ) . in the final wave functions after the superposition , these two components of the largely deformed state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b13dense](e ) ) and the @xmath83li+@xmath16 cluster state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b13dense](f ) ) constitute the rotational band , @xmath2 , with a mixing of them .",
    "the @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 states are dominated by @xmath87 in about 90% , 65% and 60% , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath88 and @xmath89 contains major percentage of @xmath90 with remarkable @xmath83li+@xmath16 cluster structure , while other states in the @xmath2 band are the mixture of these two components .",
    "it indicates that the weak - coupling cluster feature is enhanced in high spin region of the @xmath2 band .",
    "the negative - parity states @xmath91 projected from the @xmath83li+@xmath16 cluster structure construct the @xmath62 band .",
    "cm    = 6 cm      in this subsection , we discuss cluster features of the deformed bands , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , by analyzing the single - particle orbitals in the intrinsic states .",
    "hereafter , we mainly analze the major amd wave functions , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 obtained by vap for the @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 states , and compare them with that for the intruder ground state @xmath95 of @xmath3be .    first , we give single - particle energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : b13hfe ] . in these deformed states",
    ", the level structure of the single - particle wave functions shows a feature of the @xmath96 structure rather than that of spherical shell structure . that is to say , the lowest four proton orbitals and the lowest four neutron orbitals form the 2@xmath16 core , while the higher orbitals correspond to one valence proton and four valence neutrons .",
    "next , we illustrate the density distribution of the single - particle wave functions for the valence nucleons in fig .  [",
    "fig : b13single ] .",
    "the total densities of protons and neutrons are also given as well as total matter densities in the figure .",
    "generally speaking , the matter densities show two - center structures in all these deformed states . however , the behavior of the valence nucleons are different among these three states , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .    in the @xmath97 state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b13single](a ) ) , two valence neutrons occupy an approximately positive - parity orbital , and the other two neutrons and a proton are in orbitals with dominant negative - parity component .",
    "since the negative- and positive - parity orbitals of the valence nucleons are associated with the @xmath11-orbitals and @xmath12-orbitals , respectively , we can roughly describe the states in the @xmath1 band by the neutron @xmath98 excited configurations .",
    "let us turn to the molecular orbital features .",
    "the positive - parity orbital of the last two neutrons is largely deformed and has nodes along the @xmath17 direction(longitudinal axis ) .",
    "this orbital well corresponds to the so - called @xmath19 orbital in the molecular orbital picture @xcite .",
    "it has been already known that the @xmath19-like orbital of valence neutrons appear in various be isotopes ( see references in @xcite ) . in the amd study@xcite , it has been revealed that the ground state of @xmath3be is dominated by the intruder state with two neutrons in the @xmath19 orbital , which reduce kinetic energy due to the developed @xmath17-core structure . in fig .",
    "[ fig : b13single](4 ) , density distribution and single - particle orbitals of @xmath3be(@xmath99 ) are shown . as seen in the figure",
    ", the last two neutrons in the @xmath3be(@xmath99 ) state occupy the @xmath19 orbital .",
    "the point is that the neutron structure of the @xmath0b(@xmath1 ) band is very similar to that of the @xmath3be(@xmath99 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the @xmath1 is the band of the intruder neutron @xmath98 states , and interpreted as @xmath3be(@xmath99)+@xmath11 , where the @xmath3be(@xmath99 ) has the intruder configuration and the additional proton strongly couples to the deformed core .",
    "it is also interesting that the additional proton in the normal @xmath11-shell affects a change of the deformation of total density , which results in the smaller deformation of the @xmath0b(@xmath1 ) than the @xmath3be(@xmath100 ) .    in the band - head @xmath63 state of the @xmath2 band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b13single](b ) ) , @xmath67 excitation occurs in the proton shell .",
    "namely , the last proton occupy a @xmath19-like orbital , which is quite similar to that of the highest neutron orbital in the @xmath101 band and also that in the @xmath3be(@xmath99 ) .",
    "this is extraordinary configuration because excitations are naively expected in the neutron side in case of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "it can be understood by the lowering mechanism of the @xmath19 orbital due to the developed two - center structure . in the two - center shell model@xcite ,",
    "the energy of the @xmath19 orbital comes down with the increase of two - center distance @xmath15 . on the other hand , the negative - parity levels(@xmath18 )",
    "originating in the @xmath11 orbitals split and four of the negative - parity levels go up as the two - center distance increases . as a result ,",
    "the inversion of the positive - parity @xmath19 orbital and the negative - parity @xmath18 orbitals occurs . finally , in the large distance region",
    "@xmath102 fm , the @xmath19 orbital becomes the fifth orbital which is the lowest one for valence nucleons around the @xmath17 core .",
    "this situation is realized in the @xmath63 state , where the two - center structure with the distance @xmath103 fm was obtained in the present calculation .",
    "it is also associated with the hyperdeformation , where the declined positive - parity orbital becomes the fifth lowest orbital in the nilsson s deformed shell model .",
    "in fact , the deformation @xmath81 of the @xmath63 state exceeds the value @xmath104 for the superdeformation . on the other hand , four",
    "valence neutrons are localized in one side of the two - center structure .",
    "it is contrast to the molecular orbital feature of the valence proton , which is moving around the whole system .",
    "it seems that spatial correlation of four valence neutrons is so strong that form a @xmath105 shell closure . as a result",
    ", totally 8 neutrons separate into two groups consisting of 2 and 6 neutrons with a weak - coupling feature .",
    "we here give a comment on similarity of the neutron structure between the @xmath63 and @xmath78 states . comparing the neutron structure of the @xmath63 with that of the @xmath78 ,",
    "the profile of the total neutron density of the @xmath63 is similar to that of the @xmath78 described by the neutron @xmath98 configuration .",
    "therefore , we can propose an alternative interpretation in a mean - field picture that the @xmath63 state is roughly described by the @xmath106 configuration with the proton @xmath67 and the neutron @xmath98 excitations . in the present calculation",
    ", we suggest that such the exotic state , the proton intruder state of neutron - rich nuclei , may exist as the lowest @xmath4 state at @xmath107 mev .",
    "recently , the state at 4.83 mev has been assigned to be a @xmath4 state by @xmath6he(@xmath3be,@xmath0b@xmath7)@xmath8 experiments@xcite .",
    "because of strong production via the proton - transfer to the @xmath3be(@xmath5 ) state and analysis of angular dependence , ota _ et al .",
    "_ suggested this @xmath4 state to be a proton intruder state .",
    "the present prediction of the proton intruder configuration in the @xmath63 state is consistent with this observation though the theoretical excitation energy of the present calculation is slightly higher than the experimental value .    in the @xmath82 state in the @xmath2 band , all the valence proton and the valence four neutrons are localized around one of the @xmath16 cores(fig .  [ fig : b13single](c ) ) .",
    "it indicates that the molecular orbital aspect disappears , while the weak - coupling feature of @xmath16-@xmath64li clustering is enhanced .",
    "because of the spatial localization , the orbitals of the valence nucleons have no definite parity . in this case , the unnatural parity @xmath108 of the total system is carried by the parity asymmetric @xmath16-@xmath64li structure .",
    "it is in different situation from the @xmath63 state with the intruder proton configuration , where the parity @xmath108 originates in the proton @xmath67 excitation of the single - particle orbital from negative to positive one .",
    "as mentioned before , after the superposition of the amd wave functions , the proton intruder state and the @xmath109li cluster state are mixed to each other to contribute the structure change depending on @xmath48 in the @xmath110 band .",
    "the former component is dominant in the low spin states , while the latter component is significant in high spin states .",
    "= 8 cm    = 12 cm",
    "the excited states of @xmath0b were studied with a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) .",
    "we obtained the largely deformed states which construct the rotational bands , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath62 . in these deformed states , we found various kinds of cluster aspect including molecular orbital features in the two - center structure .",
    "the @xmath1 band is the deformed one with molecular orbital structure .",

    "<S> the excited states of @xmath0b were studied with a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results suggest that the intruder states with large deformations construct the rotational bands , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , starting from 5 mev and 8 mev , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> this proton intruder state has a larger deformation than superdeformation . </S>",
    "<S> the band - head @xmath4 state is assigned to the @xmath4(4.83 mev ) , which was experimentally suggested to be the proton intruder state because of the strong production via the proton - transfer to the @xmath3be(@xmath5 ) state in the @xmath6he(@xmath3be,@xmath0b@xmath7)@xmath8 experiments . </S>"
