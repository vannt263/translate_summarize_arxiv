    "ddo 210 is a faint dwarf galaxy in aquarius discovered by van den bergh ( 1959 ) .",
    "it was resolved in ground based photographic images so that it was sometimes considered to be located nearby and to be a member of the local group ( @xcite , 1979 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been known to be a dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "lo et al . (",
    "1993 ) obtained an hi mass of @xmath14 m@xmath15 and a total virial mass of @xmath16 m@xmath15 in ddo 210 , calculated assuming a distance of 1.0 mpc .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1998 ) gave an upper limit for the co emission of @xmath17 kkms@xmath18 .",
    "the distance to ddo 210 has never been measured reliably and is not yet well known . from the proximity of ddo 210 on the sky and in velocity to ngc 6822 , fisher & tully ( 1979 ) assumed that both galaxies were at the same distance ( 0.7 mpc ) . on the other hand , from @xmath19 ccd photometry of bright stars in ddo 210 , greggio et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggested that this galaxy may be located at as far as 4 mpc , placing it beyond the edge of the local group .",
    "van den bergh ( 1994 ) estimated the distance to be 0.8 mpc , from simple comparison of the ddo 210 and the leo i color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "in this paper we present a study of stellar populations in ddo 210 and the local group membership of this galaxy based on deep ground based @xmath0 ccd photometry .",
    "a brief progress report of this study was given in lee ( 1999 ) , which is superseded by this paper .",
    "this paper is composed as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and data reduction ; section 3 investigates the morphological structure of ddo 210 .",
    "section 4 presents the color - magnitude diagrams of the galaxy ; and section 5 estimates the distance to ddo 210 and concludes on the local group membership of ddo 210 .",
    "section 6 presents the surface photometry of ddo 210 , section 7 investigates the property of the brightest blue and red stars in ddo 210 , and section 8 discusses the star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "finally , section 9 summarizes the primary results .",
    "@xmath0 ccd images of ddo 210 were obtained during three different observing runs at the palomar 1.5 m telescope , the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope , and the not 2.5 m telescope of roque de los muchachos observatory at la palma .",
    "table 1 lists the journal of observations of ddo 210 . a grey scale map of the @xmath9-band ccd image of ddo 210 obtained at uh 2.2 m is displayed in fig . 1 which shows that there are many bright foreground stars in the direction of this galaxy .",
    "for the analysis of the data , we have divided the field covered by our ccd images into three regions as shown in fig .",
    "1 : the c - region covers the central main body of ddo 210 , the i - region roughly extends to the boundaries of the optical body of the galaxy , the f - region is a control field and the f2-region represents the field outside the i - region in the roque de los muchachos field .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of the stars in the ccd images were derived using dophot ( @xcite ) and daophot(@xcite ) .",
    "palomar and roque de los muchachos data were taken under photometric conditions and were calibrated using several standard stars ( @xcite ) observed on the same runs .",
    "the calibration errors of each photometry are 0.040.05 .",
    "the magnitudes of a subset of bright , well measured stars in common between the palomar and roque de los muchachos photometries were averaged to obtain a common photometric scale to which all the magnitudes were transformed .",
    "the hawaii data were also transformed to this photometric scale .",
    "the roque de los muchachos @xmath20 photometry is the deepest one so that we have preferably used it for the analysis of the stellar populations in ddo 210 .",
    "the hawaii @xmath0 data were used for the analysis of the bright stellar populations .",
    "the total number of stars which were measured in @xmath9 and at least one other color with allstar @xmath21 values less than 0.25 is @xmath22 .",
    "table 2 lists @xmath0 photometry of the measured bright stars with @xmath23 mag inside the boundary of the i - region .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 coordinates increase to the east and to the south , respectively .",
    "previous @xmath19 photometries of stars in ddo 210 were given by marconi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , greggio et al .",
    "( 1993 , g93 from now on ) and hopp & schulte - ladbeck ( 1995 , hp 95 from now on ) .",
    "the photometry by marconi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) was based on a wrong calibration and was corrected in g93 .",
    "we have compared our photometry with these previous ones .",
    "the results of the comparison are @xmath26 ( this study ",
    "g93 ) = @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( this study  g93 ) = @xmath29 for 30 common stars with @xmath23 mag , and @xmath26 ( this study  hp95 ) = @xmath30 , @xmath28 ( this study  hp95 ) = @xmath31 for 35 common stars with @xmath23 mag .",
    "these results show a reasonable agreement in @xmath9 and @xmath32 among the three photometry sets .",
    "1 shows that , morphologically , ddo 210 seems to have two components : the central component , represented by the c - region ( of size @xmath33 ) , and the extended component , represented by the i - region ( of size @xmath34 ) . from now on , by the i - region , we will refer only to the outer part of this region , i.e. , excluding the c - region .",
    "both are elongated in the east - west direction , but have not common centers , the central component lying more east - ward than the extended one .",
    "a color - map created by combining @xmath0 images shows that the stars in the central component are mostly very blue , while the stars in the outer region are mostly yellow to red .",
    "we have estimated the ellipticity and the position angle of the extended component to be roughly @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "summarizing , ddo 210 is an elongated dwarf galaxy with a likely young stellar component close but out of its center .",
    "this confirms the common tendency of dwarf galaxies to show off - center star forming regions .",
    "we display @xmath9@xmath32 and @xmath37@xmath38 diagrams of the measured stars in the c - region , i - region and f - region in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "note that the area of the ( c+i)-region in the field is the same as that of the f - region so that we can estimate the contamination due to foreground stars by comparing the diagrams of each region .",
    "several distinguishable features of the stars in ddo 210 are seen in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "first , there is a blue plume of bright stars with @xmath39 in the ( c+i ) region .",
    "comparison of the ( c+i)-region and the f - region in fig .",
    "2 shows that these bright blue stars are mostly members of ddo 210 .",
    "the brightest end of the blue plume extends up to @xmath40 mag and @xmath41 .",
    "these stars are young stars and are mostly located in the c - region .",
    "secondly , there are several bright red stars with @xmath42 mag and @xmath43 in the c and i - region in fig .",
    "2 . they might be young , red supergiants in ddo 210 .",
    "however , the fact that a large number of stars is found in the f - region with @xmath44 mag ( for every color ) ; the fact that they are more numerous in the i - region than in the c - region , as it should be expected from the bigger size of field ; and , more important , the fact that the blue population ( which must be expected as a counterpart of the bright , red one ) in the i - region is less numerous than in the c - region , would drive to the conclusion that many of the bright , red stars in field i are foreground .",
    "thirdly , fig .",
    "3 shows that there is a strong concentration of red stars fainter than @xmath45 mag and redder than @xmath46 mag in the c and i - regions .",
    "this feature corresponds to the red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) locii , populated by old and intermediate - age stars of ddo 210 .",
    "the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) is seen at @xmath47 .",
    "we estimate the distance to ddo 210 using the @xmath37 magnitude of the trgb , as described in da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) and lee et al .",
    "the @xmath37 magnitude of the trgb is estimated using the @xmath48 diagram in fig . 3 and the luminosity function of red stars in the range defined by @xmath49 ( 0.5 , 23.5 ) , ( 1.2 , 23.5 ) and ( 1.8 , 19 ) .",
    "4 shows the @xmath37-band luminosity function of the measured red stars in the ( c+i)-region .",
    "we also plot the luminosity functions of stars of the same color range in the f - region and the f2-region in fig .",
    "this figure shows that while some star of ddo 210 can be still populating the f2-region , the f - region is very likely free of them . in any case , for the purposes of this section , the contribution due to foreground stars is negligible for the bright part of the luminosity function of the ( c+i ) region .",
    "the luminosity function shows a sudden increase at @xmath50 mag .",
    "this corresponds to the trgb seen in the color - magnitude diagram in fig .",
    "3 . we will adopt this value as the @xmath37 magnitude of the trgb .",
    "the mean color of the trgb is estimated to be @xmath51 .",
    "the bolometric magnitude of the trgb is then calculated from @xmath52 } - 3.81 $ ] .",
    "adopting a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath53 dex as estimated below , we obtain a value for the bolometric magnitude of @xmath54 mag . from the equation bc@xmath55 = 0.881  0.243@xmath56 the bolometric correction at @xmath37 for the trgb",
    "is estimated to be bc@xmath57 mag .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath37 magnitude of the trgb is then @xmath58 mag .",
    "we adopt in this study the foreground reddening value @xmath59 mag for ddo 210 in burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) and ratnatunga & bahcall ( 1985 ) , corresponding to @xmath60 mag .",
    "this value is also similar to that given by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , @xmath61 .",
    "finally the distance modulus of ddo 210 is obtained : @xmath62 mag , corresponding to a distance of @xmath63 kpc .",
    "the metallicity of an old stellar population can be estimated from the color of the rgb .",
    "ddo 210 has a composite stellar population containing also young stars , but an estimate of the metallicity using that approach is still quite useful , since no previous determinations exist .",
    "we have estimated the mean metallicity using the @xmath38 color of the rgb stars 0.5 mag fainter than the trgb , @xmath64 .",
    "this color is measured from the median value of the colors of red giant branch stars with @xmath65 mag in the i - region , resulting to be @xmath66 . from this value",
    "we estimate the mean metallicity to be [ fe / h ] @xmath67 dex .",
    "this value is similar to those of dwarf irregular galaxies sextans a ( [ fe / h ] @xmath68 dex ) and uks 2323326 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath68 dex ) , and is close to the lowest end in the metallicity of stellar populations in dwarf irregular galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "5 we overlayed the loci of the red giant branches of galactic globular clusters , of m15 , m2 , and ngc 1851 , shifted according to the distance and reddening of ddo 210 .",
    "the metallicities of m15 , m2 and ngc 1851 are [ fe / h ] = 2.17 , 1.58 and 1.29 dex , respectively .",
    "5 shows that the bright part of the rgb of ddo 210 is located well between those of m15 and m2 .",
    "the broadening of the faint part of the rgb is mostly due to the photometric errors .",
    "greggio et al .",
    "( 1993 ) estimated the distance to ddo 210 to be 4 mpc , which is four times larger than our result .",
    "they derived this value from the comparison of their @xmath19 photometry of ddo 210 with the synthetic color - magnitude diagrams created using the padova models of stellar evolution .",
    "they stated in their paper that `` the true distance modulus of ddo 210 is @xmath69 , although the uncertainty is obviously large '' .",
    "if ddo 210 were at the distance of 4 mpc , the absolute magnitude of the bright tip of the rgb would be @xmath70 mag .",
    "this is unrealistic , because the @xmath37-band absolute magnitude of the trgb is known to be almost constant at @xmath71 mag for various types of resolved galaxies with old red giant populations ( @xcite ) .    with the distance estimate obtained as above",
    ", we can tell whether ddo 210 is a member of the local group or not .",
    "assuming that the center of the local group is , from our galaxy , at two thirds of the connection line between our galaxy and m31 , we derive the distance to ddo 210 from the center of the local group to be 870 kpc .",
    "in addition , the systemic velocity of ddo 210 is @xmath72 km  s@xmath18(rc3 ) , and the velocity with respect to the center of the local group is derived to be 15 km  s@xmath18 . from these values we conclude that ddo 210 is definitely a member of the local group . ddo 210 does not belong to either of the milky way subgroup or the m31 subgroup .",
    "the low surface brightness of ddo 210 and the presence of several bright foreground stars in the field , makes it difficult to derive reliably the surface photometry of the galaxy .",
    "we have proceeded for the surface photometry as follows .",
    "first , we removed several bright stars which are considered obviously to be foreground stars both from the ddo 210 and the f - region images using imedit in iraf .",
    "the mean intensity of the f - region was used for background sky estimation .",
    "then we performed aperture photometry of ddo 210 using elliptical annular apertures with the ellipticity and position angle determined in section 3 .",
    "the results are listed in table 3 and are displayed in fig .",
    "6 . in table",
    "3 @xmath73 represents a mean radius of the major axis of an ellipse , and @xmath74 presents the outer radius of an elliptical aperture .",
    "surface brightnesses are given in terms of mag arcsec@xmath75 .",
    "6 shows that the surface brightness profiles of ddo 210 follow approximately the exponential disk law .",
    "the scale lengths of ddo 210 are determined from these profiles to be @xmath76 arcsec = 161 pc and @xmath77 arcsec = 175 pc .",
    "the steep increase of the brightness in the center is due to a bright star located close to the center of the galaxy .",
    "the magnitude and color of this star ( i d 1407 ) are @xmath78 and @xmath79 . with this color , it could be a main sequence star in the halo of the milky way , 5 kpc from the sun or 7.5 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "it is also possible , however , that it is a yellow supergiant in ddo 210 .",
    "the color profile of ddo 210 in fig . 6 shows that the colors are almost constant around @xmath80 within @xmath81 arcsec ( except for the central region ) , and get redder beyond @xmath81 arcsec .",
    "this shows that blue stellar populations are located mostly within @xmath81 arcsec .",
    "the holmberg radius corresponding to @xmath82 mag arcsec@xmath75 is approximately @xmath4 arcsec = 505 pc .",
    "the integrated magnitudes of ddo 210 within this radius are : @xmath83 mag , @xmath84 mag and @xmath85 mag .",
    "de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 , rc3 ) lists , as total magnitudes of ddo 210 , @xmath86 mag and @xmath87 mag .",
    "these magnitudes are similar to ours , but the errors in our photometry are much smaller .",
    "the corresponding absolute magnitudes are @xmath88 mag , @xmath89 mag , and @xmath90 mag .",
    "this result shows that ddo 210 is the faintest among the known dwarf irregular galaxies in the local group ( @xcite ) .",
    "little is known about the nature of the brightest stars in ddo 210 . in the study of m supergiants in local group",
    "irregular galaxies elias & frogel ( 1985 ) stated `` certainly ddo 210 does not have a population of red supergiants comparable to that in sextans a , which implies that it either is more distant or has no red supergiants . '' . since it turns out that ddo 210 is closer than sextans a ( this study , @xcite ) , the only possibility is that there may be no red supergiants in ddo 210",
    "our photometry allow us to investigate the nature of the brightest stars in ddo 210 .",
    "we have determined the mean colors and magnitudes of the brightest stars . in the @xmath91 diagram of the ( c+i ) region of ddo 210 shown in fig .",
    "2 it is obvious which stars are the three brightest blue stars in ddo 210 ( ids : 1656 , 1503 , and 1517 ) , but it is not obvious which stars are the three brightest red stars because of contamination due to some foreground stars .",
    "we chose , as the three brightest red stars , three among the ones with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( ids : 1468 , 1071 , and 926 ) .",
    "the mean magnitudes and colors of these three brightest blue and red stars ( called as bsg and rsg hereafter ) in ddo 210 are derived to be , respectively , @xmath92 mag and @xmath93 , and @xmath94 mag and @xmath95 .",
    "the corresponding absolute magnitudes and colors are @xmath96 mag , @xmath97 , @xmath98 mag and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "if some of the chosen brightest red stars are foreground stars , the mean magnitudes of the brightest red stars in ddo 210 will be fainter .    we have compared the magnitudes and colors of the brightest stars in ddo 210 with those of other galaxies with young stellar populations in fig .",
    "the data for other galaxies are from lyo & lee ( 1997 ) .",
    "7 shows that both the brightest blue and red stars in ddo 210 are the faintest among the sample galaxies .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that ddo 210 is the faintest among the known dwarf irregular galaxies in the local group .",
    "7 shows also that the brightest red stars are the least red among the sample galaxies .",
    "this can be interpreted in the sense that the brightest red stars in ddo 210 may be more metal - poor than those in brighter galaxies .",
    "from a qualitative point of view , the presence of a conspicuous rgb - agb structure implies star formation at intermediate to old ages in ddo 210 .",
    "moreover , the age of the youngest population in ddo 210 can be estimated from comparison of the cmd of fig .",
    "2 with theoretical isochrones . fig .",
    "8 displays the @xmath91 cmd of ddo 210 together with three isochrones for metallicities @xmath100 and ages 30 , 100 and 300 myrs from the padova library ( see bertelli et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) .",
    "it shows that star formation as recent as some 30 myrs ago has taken place in the galaxy . ]    the star formation history ( sfh ) can be derived quantitatively in detail from deep cmds as shown by gallart et al .",
    "the cmd of ddo 210 is not deep enough for such a derivation , but it can still be used to sketch the sfh . for this purpose ,",
    "stars with @xmath101 have been counted in the cmd of fields c - region , i - region and f2-region and divided into two groups : bluer and redder than @xmath102 .",
    "after normalization to the same area , the counts of the f2-region have been subtracted from those of the c and i - regions to correct of foreground contamination .",
    "the relatively strong foreground contamination of the ddo 210 field prevents us from using the stars over the trgb for the calculation of the sfh . on the other hand , the maximum magnitude used ( @xmath103 mag ) and the fact that we pursue only a rough estimate of the sfr , allow us to neglect crowding effects .    following a method similar to that described in aparicio et al .",
    "( 1997b ) and aparicio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , a synthetic cmd has been calculated with 100,000 stars brighter than @xmath104 mag , a constant sfr and random metallicities in the interval @xmath105 , which corresponds to the interval of [ fe / h ] found from the rgb of ddo 210 .",
    "the synthetic stars have been divided into two age intervals : younger and older than 1 gyr , and the same boxes as for the observational cmds have been defined in each of the resulting synthetic cmds .",
    "the resulting sfrs for the 15 to 1 gyrs ago and the 1 to 0 gyrs ago are given in table 4 and shown in fig . 9 for the central ( c ) and the outer ( i ) regions of ddo 210 .",
    "these values are also given after surface normalization ( right - hand ordinate axis of fig .",
    "the areas used for those normalizations have been 2.18 arcsec@xmath106 or @xmath107 pc@xmath106 for the c - region and 8.11 arcsec@xmath106 or @xmath108 pc@xmath106 for the i - region .",
    "ddo 210 shows a sfh behavior in its central region similar to what has been found in other dirr galaxies , like ngc 6822 ( @xcite ) , pegasus ( @xcite ) , antlia ( @xcite ) and ddo 187 ( @xcite ) . in overall ,",
    "it consists in an enhancement of the sfr for the recent past of the history of the galaxy with respect to the value averaged for its entire life .",
    "this can be interpreted as the result of a fluctuating star formation rate ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this recent strength of the sfr does not affect the entire galaxy but the central part only . for the outer i - region ,",
    "the sfr decreased for recent epochs .",
    "this behaviour is common to other dirr : wlm ( @xcite ) , antlia ( @xcite ) , phoenix ( @xcite ) , ddo 187 ( @xcite ) and may suggest a two - components structure of the kind disk - halo of bigger spiral galaxies .",
