    "liners ( low ionization nuclear emission - line region galaxies ) are the most common and lowest energy examples of active galaxies known ( heckman 1980 ) .",
    "the main liner characteristic is unusually strong forbidden line transitions from low ionization states such as [ oii](@xmath6=3727   ) , [ nii](@xmath6=6583   ) , and [ sii](@xmath6=6717,6731 ) relative to lines from higher ionization states .",
    "the original definition used by heckman ( 1980 ) was [ oii](@xmath6=3727   ) / [ oiii](@xmath6=5007   ) @xmath4 1 and [ oi](@xmath6=6300   ) / [ oiii](@xmath6=5007   ) @xmath4 1/3 .",
    "classical liner galaxies also have much less total energy in the spectral lines as compared to seyfert galaxies and other types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ; often down by a factor of a 100 in comparison to seyfert s .",
    "the weakness of the spectral lines makes liners difficult to study , particularly when the galaxies often have strong stellar absorption features .",
    "fast ( v@xmath7100  km  s@xmath8 ) shocks ( heckman , 1980 ) , photoionization from a power - law source ( e.g. ho , filippenko , & sargent 1993 ) or from a cluster of very hot stars ( e.g. terlevich & melnick 1985 ; shields 1992 ) , especially in very dense environments , can all duplicate the observed emission line flux ratios in liners .",
    "an important aspect of the star formation models , involves compact supernova remnants which are confined by the high densities within the nuclear region and which produce strong shocks .",
    "x - ray heating is particularly attractive for photoionization because hard x - rays are able to penetrate deeply into molecular clouds creating large partially ionized regions where low ionization species will dominate .",
    "an intriguing possible variation on the photoionization models recently proposed by eracleous , livio & binette ( 1995 ) , is that liners have a compact object ( probably a black hole ) in the nucleus which periodically disrupts a star during a close orbital approach . as the stellar material accretes onto the central source ,",
    "high energy photons are produced and a seyfert - like broad line region appears .",
    "as the material is consumed , the ionizing flux drops and the high ionization states weaken quickly .",
    "low ionization lines , however , remain strong for much longer since the decay time is longer and the light crossing time in this region is much larger than that of the broad line region .",
    "this `` duty cycle hypothesis '' was motivated by the observation that about 20% of liners had detectable 2300 emission with hst ( maoz et al .",
    "these uv bright galaxies , have no other obvious difference from the uv dark liners . under this theory ,",
    "the uv bright galaxies would still have ongoing accretion , while the others are in the quiescent phase .",
    "in support of this theory , eracleous et al .",
    "( 1995 ) point to ngc 1097 which was observed to make a sudden transition from a liner to a seyfert 1 ( storchi - bergmann , baldwin & wilson 1993 ) .",
    "it is also possible that liners represent a heterogeneous class of objects .",
    "some liners may have a central `` monster '' like seyfert galaxies , while others have one or more dense clusters of hot young stars .",
    "shocks may play a role in enhancing the forbidden lines in either of these two groups .",
    "whatever the case , extending the number of observed spectral diagnostics into the infrared gives greater leverage on the problem of understanding the ultimate origin of the liner phenomena .",
    "a significant number of important infrared spectral features exist which can provide useful astrophysical insights . among",
    "these are the br@xmath3 ( 2.1655@xmath0 m ) and pa@xmath1 ( 1.2818@xmath0 m ) hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "these lines trace ionizing photons and can be directly related to other recombination lines and to the strength of the uv continuum , while suffering much less from dust extinction than the balmer lines .",
    "another series of important infrared lines are the h@xmath2 rotation - vibration transitions which have no analog within the optical .",
    "the strongest h@xmath2 line is the 1 - 0 s(1 ) transition at 2.1218 @xmath0 m .",
    "h@xmath2 emission is ubiquitous in starburst and seyfert galaxies and is thought to originate in slow shocks , uv fluorescence and x - ray heating .",
    "the forbidden transitions of singly ionized iron ( [ feii ] ) , are also strong in the infrared .",
    "iron is believed to play an an important role as a coolant in shocked environments ( nussbaumer and storey 1988 ) but in the general interstellar medium it is often depleted compared to other elements since most iron is locked up in dust grains .",
    "the strongest near infrared [ feii ] line is the 1.2567@xmath0 m transition in the j band .",
    "this line is often very strong in seyfert galaxies and in most cases is thought to trace faster shocks ( @xmath7100 km sec@xmath8 ) than the h@xmath2 lines ( graham et al .",
    "[ feii ] is also thought to be strong in x - ray heated environments where dust grains have been evaporated .    in this paper , we report new near infrared spectroscopy of a sample of bright liners , and we attempt to use these data to constrain the possible excitation mechanisms .",
    "the target list began with the original sample of 30 liners ( including several `` transition '' objects which have line ratios on the border between liners and seyferts ) from heckman ( 1980 ) , which are in the right ascension range between 8@xmath930@xmath10 and 13@xmath930@xmath10 . to extend the target list ,",
    "additional galaxies were selected from keel ( 1983 ) and ho et al .",
    "because of bad weather during most of the spring runs , half of the objects observed with the infrared spectrograph are from these additional surveys . in the end",
    "11 classical liners were observed in both the j and k bands and 1 additional galaxy had only j - band spectra taken .",
    "table 1 lists the galaxies observed , the dates of the observations , and the wavelengths covered .",
    "[ t : irlog ]    since liners typically have faint emission features , it is important to concentrate the observations on the potentially brightest near infrared lines . among those lines accessible at zero redshift ,",
    "pa@xmath1 is typically the brightest feature in agn and starburst galaxies . under case b recombination , br@xmath3 is fainter than pa@xmath1 by a factor of about six , but is still usually one of the brightest lines .",
    "the brightest fe@xmath11 line is at 1.2567 @xmath0 m which is only 0.0251 @xmath0 m away from pa@xmath1 , making this an obvious pair of lines to observe simultaneously .",
    "the strongest h@xmath2 line available at zero redshift is from the 1 - 0 s(1 ) transition at 2.1218 @xmath0 m .",
    "this line is separated by 0.0437 @xmath0 m from br@xmath3 , again creating an obvious pair of lines to observe simultaneously . in order to maximize the number of liners observed , only these two settings were observed .      near infrared spectra",
    "were obtained using the 200 inch hale telescope at palomar observatory from 1994 april to 1995 may .",
    "the spectra were taken with a new near infrared longslit spectrometer , described in larkin et al .",
    "for all observations , the lower resolution grating ( r@xmath71000 ) was used with the slit set at 0.75  x 40  . to center",
    "the objects on the slit , images were first taken through a wide open slit ( 10  x 40  ) and the telescope was moved to place the nuclear centroid onto the slit center .",
    "the position angle of the slit was selected either by aligning the slit along a position angle of known extended h@xmath5 emission ( larkin et al .",
    "1997 , in preparation ) or by orienting the slit along the minor axis .",
    "for all objects the galaxy was moved back and forth along the slit between two locations 10  from the opposite ends of the slit ( 20  between the two positions ) . in this way , each spectrum in a pair could serve as the sky frame for image subtraction of the other mated spectrum .",
    "two grating angles were typically used to give rest frame wavelength coverages from 1.245 to 1.300  @xmath0 m ( r@xmath71050 ) , and 2.087 to 2.207  @xmath0 m ( r@xmath7850 ) .",
    "these wavelength ranges were selected to include the redshifted [ feii ] ( @xmath6 = 1.2567@xmath0 m ) , and pa@xmath1 ( @xmath6 = 1.2818@xmath0 m ) spectral lines , and the redshifted h@xmath2 ( @xmath6 = 2.1218@xmath0 m ) and br@xmath3 ( @xmath6 = 2.1655@xmath0 m ) lines .",
    "all wavelengths quoted in this paper are values in air .",
    "the yale bright star catalog ( hoffleit 1964 ) was used to select main sequence g stars that were observed close in time and airmass to the galaxies in order to remove telluric absorption from the galaxy spectra and to serve as flat fields .",
    "the chopping secondary of the telescope was driven with a triangular waveform to move the star back and forth along the slit to uniformly illuminate the array .",
    "the stars represent a good approximation to an ideal blackbody at these wavelengths except for weak hydrogen absorption lines . in order to properly correct the galactic spectra ,",
    "these lines must first be removed from the stellar spectra by interpolation . for all of the galaxies in the sample except ngc  404",
    ", the redshift is high enough ( @xmath4300 km s@xmath8 ) that contamination from the interpolated portion of the g star spectra should not affect the emission lines observed .",
    "the galaxy spectra were reduced by first subtracting image pairs .",
    "the galaxy frames were then divided by the interpolated star frames .",
    "bad pixels were then replaced by the median of their neighboring pixels .",
    "atmospheric oh emission lines in the stellar spectrum were fit with third order polynomials in order to remove a slight curvature in the spectral lines and to wavelength calibrate the spectra .",
    "wavelengths for the oh lines were obtained from oliva and origlia  ( 1992 ) .",
    "slight spatial curvature was removed by fitting spectra taken of a calibrator star which was moved in 5  steps along the slit .",
    "broad band 1.25@xmath0 m ( j - band ) and 2.2@xmath0 m ( k - band ) images taken with a mirror placed in front of the grating were used to flux calibrate the spectra .",
    "these images , were themselves flux calibrated by matching synthetic aperture fluxes in the images with aperture photometry from either neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , aaronson ( 1977 ) , or willner et al .",
    "( 1985 ) . a 0.75  x 3  synthetic aperture on the same broad band images was then used to determine the flux densities within the slit for the spectroscopic observations .",
    "these `` slit '' measurements were then used to scale the counts in the spectra to actual flux .",
    "the flux calibrated spectra for the 12 classical liners observed at @xmath71000 resolution are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the j - band spectra are shown in the left panel and the k - band in the right .",
    "many of the spectra have been shifted upwards to prevent overlap and the amount of the shift is indicated in parenthesis next to the galaxy s name .",
    "the locations of the most common emission and absorption features are marked at the top of each panel .",
    "the [ feii ] line at 1.2567@xmath0 m is the most common emission line detected , being present in 8 of the 12 galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath2 line at 2.1218@xmath0 m is also a common feature , being found in 4 of the 11 galaxies with k - band spectra .",

    "br@xmath3 ( 2.166@xmath0 m ) is undetected in all 11 galaxies with k - band spectra ( note some of the spectra show features near br@xmath3 due to residual hydrogen absorption features in the calibration stars ) .",

    "for all of the galaxies with pa@xmath1 seen in absorption , this fiducial absorption correction is sufficient to make the corrected values positive or zero , indicating that absorption is at least comparable to the emission line strengths , and is a plausible explanation for the nondetections .",

    "for the galaxies ngc  4258 and ngc  4826 the oi / h@xmath5 ratio is close to that found in seyfert galaxies and the upper limit on h@xmath2 emission also groups the objects with seyferts .",
    "this is not unexpected since both are considered prime candidates for dwarf seyferts ( filippenko and sargent 1985 ) .",
    "seven objects have an h@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratio above 3 , including 6 liners and the unusual object ngc  6240 which does satisfy the optical classification for a liner .",

    "figure 5 plots the optical [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratio against h@xmath2/br@xmath3 for the objects in this sample and the available objects in the literature . unlike figures 2 - 4 , no obvious correlation is evident",
    ", however , figure 5 shows a clear separation between the liners and seyfert galaxies primarily due to the difference in h@xmath2/br@xmath3 . as mentioned above",
    ", the six known objects with h@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratios above 3 have liner type spectra .",
    "starburst galaxies are located in the lower left corner of these figures and are well separated from the other types .",
    "the [ feii]/pa@xmath1 ratio is significantly poorer at separating the various galaxy classes .",
    "the h@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratio is probably better at separating the classes than low ionization optical lines , because h@xmath2 traces the colder molecular gas and is therefore less closely coupled with the high ionization lines like [ oiii ] .",
    "the three liners which are not grouped with the others in figure 5 , all have unusual activity .",
    "ngc  4258 is a transition object with substantial recent evidence for a central black hole ( see discussion of individual objects in the appendix ) .",
    "it is not unexpected , then that it falls within the seyferts in this figure .",
    "ngc  4826 has an extrapolated pa@xmath1 flux almost twice as strong as can be accounted for with the fiducial absorption applied in section 3.2 .",
    "this may imply a young stellar population and recent star formation , and could explain why it is consistent with the starburst galaxies in the figure .",
    "ngc  3998 , as argued below has a central source with seyfert - like ratios , while in large apertures ( d@xmath75  ) the low ionization lines are stronger and it appears to be a true liner .",
    "this could explain why our small aperture shows such a low h@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratio , and why it lies within the range of seyfert values .      in figures 6 and 7 ,",
    "the iras 25 to 60 micron index is plotted against the h@xmath2/br@xmath3 and [ oi]/h@xmath5 , respectively for the liners in our sample and from the literature as well as many starbursts , seyferts , composites ( seyfert + starburst ) , and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) also from the literature .",
    "the index is defined as :    @xmath33    the iras indices measure the shape of the far infrared continuum and @xmath5(25:60 ) in particular is thought to reflect the relative importance of warm ( 30 - 50 k ) dust which dominates the 60@xmath0 m band to hot ( 100 - 150 k ) dust which dominates the 25@xmath0 m band . for reference ,",
    "non - active galaxies have a large range of @xmath5(25:60 ) , but are typically between -2 and -3 .",
    "mouri and taniguchi ( 1992 ) found that starburst galaxies and to a lesser extent , infrared ultraluminous galaxies , showed a linear correlation between this iras index and h@xmath2/br@xmath3 .",
    "they further found that seyfert galaxies showed no such correlation , and although some seyferts have @xmath5(25:60 ) comparable to starbursts , most seyferts had a shallower 25 to 60 @xmath0 m slope than the starburst correlation predicts .",
    "in fact , the @xmath5(25:60 ) index has been found to be an efficient identifier of seyfert galaxies , especially the most luminous objects where the host galaxy colors play less of a role ( de grijp , et al .",
    "the liners show a large spread in @xmath5(25:60 ) from ngc  3998 at -1.15 to ngc  4826 at -3.23 , while showing little variation in h@xmath2 , and [ oi ] .",
    "liners also show a weak trend that the objects with flatter @xmath5(25:60 ) have weaker [ feii ] than the steeper index liners .",
    "some of the liners and seyferts are close to the starburst correlations , but most have flatter indices than either the h@xmath2/br@xmath3 of [ oi]/h@xmath5 would predict .",
    "ulirgs show the opposite trend with more of them on the steeper side of the relationship , indicating an unusually large ratio of warm to hot dust .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the liners with the flattest @xmath5(25:60 ) ( ngc  3998 , ngc  7479 , ngc  7743 , and ngc  4258 ) and are the furthest from the starburst correlation , have lower [ feii]/pa@xmath1 than the steeper spectrum liners .",
    "these four objects are also the strongest candidates in the sample to have seyfert - like nuclei ( in fact ngc  7479 and ngc  4258 are often classified as seyfert 2 s ) . also ngc",
    "3998 is the strongest x - ray source among the liner sample , and has recently been found to have an unobscured hard ( 1 - 12 kev ) compact , power - law , x - ray source by asca ( serlemitsos 1995 ) . for the liners with steep @xmath5(25:60 )",
    "the iras index provides little information except that the central source does not alter the global infrared colors significantly .",
    "the majority of these sources , however , do have the highest ratios of [ feii]/pa@xmath1 .      if the liners with the flattest @xmath5(25:60 ) , and the lowest [ feii]/pa@xmath1 are x - ray heated by a power - law source , as in seyfert galaxies , there should be sufficient x - rays to power the observed infrared line emission .",
    "the ratio of [ feii]/pa@xmath1 is still relatively high in these objects , however , and some degree of grain destruction to increase the gas phase iron abundance is probably necessary .",
    "a successful x - ray heating model must therefore include a significant hard x - ray component .",
    "unfortunately , very little is known about the hard x - ray output of liners .",
    "the best survey for comparison is from the einstein satellite which operated out to 3.5 kev . for seyfert 1 s the luminosity in the range 0.5 to 3.5 kev",
    "is thought to be comparable to the hard x - ray luminosity ( van der werf et al . 1993 ) .",
    "figure 8 plots the einstein flux ( 0.2 to 3.5 kev ) for the available liners in the sample against the total nuclear [ feii ] flux . to obtain the total nuclear flux ,",
    "we have applied the same aperture correction discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "this correction factor ( roughly a factor of 3 for all objects ) was determined by placing a synthetic aperture of the same width as our slit on h@xmath5+nii images ( larkin et al .",
    "1997 in preparation ) and comparing this to the total nuclear flux . in models of hard x - ray heating , about 1% of the 1 to 10 kev energy can come out in the 1.2567@xmath0 m [ feii ] line . in the figure",
    "the 1% curve is plotted as a rough approximation of the minimum efficiency of x - ray to [ feii ] conversion .",
    "the fact that many of the seyfert 2 s are below this line probably results from dust obscuration of the soft x - ray flux . for the liners with einstein detections near to or above the 1% line , there are probably sufficient x - rays to power the iron lines . as in seyfert 2 s",
    ", dust obscuration may have a significant effect on the soft x - ray fluxes of many of the liners making it difficult to estimate the role of x - ray heating in those objects without x - ray detections and those below the 1% line .",
    "for the five liners in this sample , the ratios of x - ray(.2 - 3.5  kev ) flux to [ feii ] flux are : 660 for ngc  3998 ; 440 for ngc  4258 ; 70 for ngc  4736 ; 70 for ngc  4826 and 175 for ngc  5194 .",
    "the first few liners ( ngc  3998 , ngc  4579 , ngc  3031 ( m81 ) , ngc  4258 , ngc  5194 ( m51 ) ) observed with asca all require a power - law x - ray source out to 12 kev , which appears to be point - like ( serlemitsos 1995 ) .",
    "although the current asca sample is not a randomly selected sample and the result is only preliminary , it does support x - ray heating in at least some liners .",
    "in addition to the emission lines , several atomic absorption features are seen in many of the galaxies .",
    "these features were found by shifting the spectra to the rest frame and noting that several of the galaxies showed the same features .",
    "further confidence that they are real features in the galaxies spectra and are not a reduction artifact comes from a comparison with optical spectra in filippenko and sargent ( 1985 ) which show that the galaxies with the strongest infrared absorption lines also have the strongest optical absorption lines . in figure 1 , these suspected absorption lines are marked by vertical marks at the top of each panel with the most likely identification given .",
    "the line identifications were found by comparing the spectra with a very high resolution ( r @xmath7 100,000 ) spectrum of the solar photosphere ( hall 1973 ) . among the strongest lines present in the galaxies spectra",
    "are a na doublet ( @xmath342.2062,2.2090@xmath0 m ) and a mg doublet ( @xmath341.2423,1.2433@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the na doublet is seen in all seven galaxies where the spectra extend to this wavelength .",
    "one feature at @xmath35 = 1.2893@xmath150.0003  @xmath0 m is still not identified , although it is detected in 5 or 6 of the galaxies .",
    "it is possible that this line is from a molecular species present in cool giants but not in the sun .",
    "the most striking feature of the infrared spectra is the strength of the [ feii ] and h@xmath2 features in relation to hydrogen recombination lines , and the correlation of h@xmath2 and [ feii ] with the optical [ oi ] line .",
    "ho et al . (",
    "1993 ) found that there was a clear separation between liners and transitional objects at [ oi]/h@xmath5 @xmath7  @xmath36 .",
    "we find a similar separation between the majority of liners in this sample and seyferts at [ feii]/pa@xmath1 of @xmath7 1 , and h@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratio of @xmath7 3 . this transition is clearer than the difference in [ oi]/h@xmath5 ratios for liners and seyferts . the one galaxy which does not satisfy this is ngc  3998 , which as argued above , satisfies the liner criterion only for larger apertures than employed here , and which is seyfert - like in small apertures . in this object",
    "at least , the liner classification may be based solely upon circumnuclear emission lines which may be photoionized or shock heated by a central agn .",
    "the h@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratio also divides the seyfert s from the starburst galaxies in the literature at @xmath7 0.6 , although several exceptions are evident .",
    "it is therefore , interesting to consider that h@xmath2/br@xmath3 can alone be used to classify galaxies as either starbursts , seyferts ( and transitional liners ) , and liners .",
    "figure 5 shows that by including the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratio , the divisions between these classes become even clearer .",
    "it must , however , be remembered that these trends apply only when the true pa@xmath1 and br@xmath3 emission line fluxes free of stellar absorption are available or can be estimated with reasonable precision .",
    "this is particularly important for liners where the stellar features often dominate the nuclear activity even for small apertures .",
    "an interesting result of this work is that the liners with infrared line detections break up into basically two groups based on the ratio of [ feii ] to pa@xmath1 . in the following",
    ", liners with [ feii]/pa@xmath1 above 2 will be referred to as `` strong '' [ feii ] liners , while the ones below 2 will be called `` weak '' [ feii ] liners .",
    "the [ feii]/pa@xmath1 line ratio uses the extrapolated pa@xmath1 line fluxes discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "if the extinction towards the nucleus were very patchy it could affect these extrapolated values and therefore the classification scheme .",
    "since most of the galaxies are either nearly face on spirals or ellipticals with little dust , we do nt believe this is a large affect .",
    "the line ratios can equally be thought of as the ratio of [ feii ] to h@xmath5 corrected for the measured extinction between h@xmath5 and h@xmath1 .",
    "the `` weak '' [ feii ] liners include ngc  4826 , ngc  3998 , ngc  4258 , ngc  7479 and ngc  7743 .",
    "all three of the liners with relatively flat far infrared spectra ( @xmath5(25:60)@xmath4 - 2 ) are `` weak '' [ feii ] liners .",
    "although the interpretation of the @xmath5(25:60 ) index is complicated , a flatter spectrum probably indicates a strong nuclear source that is able to alter the global dust temperatures and affect the iras colors .",
    "the only two liners with detected broad h@xmath5 lines ( ngc  3998 and ngc  4258 ) are `` weak '' [ feii ] liners .",
    "these two liners are also the strongest x - ray sources in the sample and have the highest ratios of x - ray flux to [ feii ] flux . the other three `` weak '' [ feii ]",
    "liners also show evidence for seyfert - like activity .",
    "technically , ngc  7479 , should actually be classified as a seyfert 2 based on its optical line ratios .",
    "ngc  7743 also has unusual line ratios with the highest [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratio in the sample indicating a relatively high state of ionization .",
    "the last `` weak '' [ feii ] liner , ngc  4826 is technically a `` weak '' [ oi ] liner since [ oi]/h@xmath5 is less than @xmath37 , and it has the lowest h@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratio in the sample .    the `` strong '' [ feii ]",
    "liners are ngc  404 , ngc  4736 , ngc  5194 and ngc  7217 .",
    "none of the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners has a detected broad h@xmath5 line , and none are known as strong x - ray sources . among the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners , ngc  404 and ngc  4736 are particularly noteworthy for having unusually strong balmer absorption lines indicative of recent star formation .",
    "ngc  4736 and ngc",
    "7217 also have inner rings or arcs of h@xmath5 emission probably resulting from circumnuclear star formation .",
    "ngc  5194 was classified by heckman ( 1980 ) as a transition object ( its oxygen line ratios are on the border between seyfert and liner classifications ) .",
    "it does , however , have a high ratio of [ feii]/pa@xmath1 ( 2.3 ) and a very strong h@xmath2 line ( h@xmath2/br@xmath3 = 8) . because ngc  5194 is closer to a seyfert in optical line ratios , and because it has a good x - ray detection , however , it is not as consistent with star formation as the other `` strong '' [ feii ] liners",
    ". all of the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners have steep ( @xmath5(25:60)@xmath17 - 2 ) iras indices .",
    "an appealing model is that the two groupings reflect different excitation mechanisms ( see the following subsection ) .",
    "the `` weak '' [ feii ] liners may be low luminosity seyferts , while the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners may be powered by compact starbursts .",
    "compact supernova remnants ( pressure confined ) are likely to enhance the [ feii ] line in the latter group .",
    "the [ feii ] luminosities of several of the galaxies , in particular the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners ngc  404 and ngc  4736 , are only a few times those expected for individual supernova remnants , making supernovae , an attractive excitation source .",
    "although this model of `` strong '' and `` weak '' [ feii ] liners is attractive it is by no means definitive , since none of the objects in either sample is unambiguously a seyfert - like or starburst - like nucleus .",
    "the next subsection also shows that x - ray heating from a central seyfert - like source can reproduce the large [ feii]/pa@xmath1 ratios of `` strong '' [ feii ] liners under special conditions .",
    "it is , however , suggestive that the liners with the strongest indications of recent star formation have the greatest [ feii]/pa@xmath1 ratios .",
    "it is possible that the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners have a seyfert - like core , but also have a surrounding star formation region where supernova remnants enhance the [ feii ] emission .",
    "the main goal of this study was to characterize the infrared spectra of liner galaxies with the further goal of determining the source of the strong , low ionization emission lines in liner spectra .",
    "the observation that both the molecular line h@xmath2 1 - 0 s(0 ) and the [ feii ] line are strong , places stringent requirements on the excitation mechanism since ( 1 ) h@xmath2 is relatively easy to destroy , and ( 2 ) 98% of the iron is tied up in dust grains in the local ism . in order for a common mechanism to power",
    "both lines , as well as the optical [ oi ] line , it must not destroy all of the h@xmath2 molecules and yet must free up iron through dust grain destruction .",
    "the strength of the [ feii ] line is much harder to explain through increased metallicity , since the oxygen , nitrogen and sulfur lines in the optical are not consistent with extremely high metallicities .",
    "a general equation for the strength of [ feii ] versus pa@xmath1 is derived from blietz et al .",

    "this equation is of course only valid if both lines arise within the same parcel of gas .",
    "if multiple excitation mechanisms exist , then the equation can still be used to try and constrain the dominant mechanism .",
    "since @xmath41 is @xmath70.02 in the local ism , even for the most extreme possible temperature and density for these objects , coef @xmath12 @xmath41 is only 0.5 .",
    "so unless the gas phase abundance of iron is much greater than locally , and/or the ionized fraction of iron to hydrogen is much greater than 1 , then [ feii]/pa@xmath1 can not reach the level of the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners .",
    "several types of environments can immediately be ruled out based on equation [ e : coef ] .",

    "1989 ) . in order to reach",
    "[ feii]/pa@xmath1 of even the values of @xmath70.6 seen in the `` weak '' [ feii ] liners requires the gas phase abundance of iron ( @xmath41 ) to be 0.12 ( a six fold increase in gas phase iron ) for even the most extreme conditions ( t = 10@xmath44 k and n = 10@xmath44 @xmath32 ) . for more reasonable conditions ( t = 10@xmath40 k and n = 10@xmath40 @xmath32 )",
    ", @xmath41 must be greater than 1 , which is unphysical .",
    "even @xmath41 of 0.12 is difficult to explain in an hii region , since there are no strong mechanisms to process dust grains . since galactic hii regions",
    "are observed to have very weak [ feii ] emission , it is expected that extragalactic hii regions should have [ feii]/pa@xmath1 ratios much less than unity .",
    "the photodissociation region around strong uv sources were also examined by blietz et al .",
    "( 1994 ) since these regions can produce strong h@xmath2 and other low ionization lines .",
    "the temperatures in the photodissociation regions are always below 2000 k , however , which greatly reduces the [ feii ] flux ( coef @xmath17 1 ) .",
    "also these regions tend to be very thin , so the ratios of low ionization lines to hydrogen recombination lines ( which are generated interior to the ionization fronts ) is in general very low .",
    "x - ray heating from a nonthermal power - law source can produce an extended ionization front if very hard x - rays are present ( halpern and grindlay 1980 ) .",
    "in such extended regions , the fraction of ionized iron to hydrogen can reach 100 , although the temperature may be only @xmath73000 k ( blietz et al .",
    "for this temperature , the coef parameter is about 0.11 for any density over @xmath710@xmath40 @xmath32 . for a ratio of [ feii]/pa@xmath1 as high as 2",
    ", @xmath41 must be at least 18% .",
    "although high , this is not unfeasible since hard x - rays can destroy dust grains .",
    "for the `` weak '' [ feii ] liners , the ratio of [ feii]/pa@xmath1 of @xmath70.6 , @xmath41 need only be 0.055 , which is very reasonable .",
    "x - rays are therefore an attractive emission source for the `` weak '' [ feii ] liners and may play a part in powering the infrared emission lines in the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners as well .",
    "another possible excitation mechanism is a j - type shock ( jump discontinuity shocks without magnetic precursors ) .",
    "shocks can produce large fractions of ionized iron to hydrogen and provide a natural mechanism for dust grain processing .",
    "seab and shull ( 1983 ) find that fast shocks ( 40 to 120 km s@xmath8 ) can increase the gas phase iron abundance ( @xmath41 ) up to 60% .",
    "for an expected ionization fraction of iron to hydrogen of around 2 , j - shocks then require coef to be greater than 1.7 for [ feii]/pa@xmath1 around 2 , and 0.5 for [ feii]/pa@xmath1 of 0.6 . these values are possible for virtually any temperature above 10@xmath40 and density above 10@xmath40 .",
    "this fact makes shocks a very attractive mechanism for the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners , and they may also produce the [ feii ] emission in the `` weak '' [ feii ] liners . if present in `` weak '' [ feii ] liners , the effect of shocks is probably diluted by other mechanisms . although fast shocks will destroy h@xmath2 , there may exist a range of gas densities making a variety of shock speeds possible .",
    "the strong h@xmath2 lines may then result from the same shock mechanism that produces the [ feii ] emission , but in different parts of the gas .",
    "both hard x - ray heating , and fast shocks are plausible mechanisms for all of the liners , although the `` weak '' [ feii ] liners are easier to explain by x - ray heating while `` strong '' [ feii ] liners are more consistent with shock excitation .",
    "both mechanisms are also able to generate the h@xmath2 emission , but shocks are more efficient at [ feii ] production , and are better able to explain the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners . if shocks are present , either compact supernova remnants ( pressure confined ) , or other mechanisms such as cloud - cloud collisions , or outflowing winds are plausible shock sources .",
    "supernova remnants are the likely source for the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners since many of these show other evidence for recent star formation .      in any survey of a small sample of objects with faint emission features , biases in selection , photometry and aperture correction , sensitivity and a large number of other sources may play a significant role . in this subsection",
    "we discuss some of the most obvious sources of bias , and try to estimate their effects .",
    "one of the largest biases affecting this survey is the size of the sample and the fact that the line detections are preferentially in the most active liners ; the others are too faint .",
    "a significant population of liners have featureless infrared spectra and can not be addressed by the infrared diagnostics . for most quantities discussed ,",
    "there is a relatively smooth transition from liner - like spectral properties to seyfert - like .",
    "an important consideration is that the least active liners , which have no line information , are less like seyfert s in their emission mechanism than those discussed in detail , and many of the correlations may not hold for these liners .",
    "we have tried , in a limited fashion , to address this problem by also using the optical [ oi](6300 ) line , which is well correlated with the infrared lines for all liners , in examining the excitation mechanisms . since this line",
    "must be detected for a galaxy to be classified as a liner according to the original definition , it does not suffer from the same selection bias .",
    "however , it is possible that the [ oi ] emission does not arise from the same regions as the infrared lines .",
    "another bias is the lack of hydrogen recombination line detections . since we are applying optical extinction estimates to extrapolate the intrinsic strengths of the near infrared features",
    ", we may be subject to large uncertainties if the extinctions to the optical and ir emitting regions are significantly different .",
    "if the extinction to the infrared lines were higher than predicted from h@xmath5 and h@xmath1 , then the estimated infrared recombination lines would be too low , and the corresponding ratios with [ feii ] and h@xmath2 too high .",
    "since the extrapolated [ feii]/pa@xmath1 and h@xmath2/br@xmath3 line ratios correlate with the [ oi ] line , it is not likely that the recombination strengths have been severely underestimated . also , since the extrapolated values of pa@xmath1 and br@xmath3 from optical lines are typically higher than can be accounted for by correcting the observed spectra for stellar absorption , it is more likely that pa@xmath1 and br@xmath3 have been overestimated which would imply that the line ratios are even higher than calculated .",
    "a logical next step will be to obtain high signal to noise infrared spectra of several template galaxies for subtraction in order to identify extremely weak emission lines lost in stellar absorption features .",
    "it is possible that the difference in size between our aperture and those used in the optical plays a role in increasing the observed [ feii ] and h@xmath2 ratios .",
    "knop ( personal communication 1997 ) has used a similar small aperture to measure the infrared line ratios in some nearby seyfert galaxies and has found that many of them have slightly higher [ feii ] and h@xmath2 flux ratios than seyferts in the literature , but the effect is much too weak to account for the differences seen between the liners and the seyferts .",
    "there is one object ( ngc  2110 ) in the knop sample , however , which is a seyfert with a very large [ feii ] to pa@xmath1 flux ratio of 8 , and an h@xmath2 to br@xmath3 flux ratio of 3 .",
    "this object is extremely interesting but does not reflect the ratios typically observed for seyfert galaxies in small apertures .",
    "in fact , several of the liners that have multi - aperture optical spectra , show stronger low ionization lines in the larger aperture , which implies just the opposite effect .    in general",
    ", we believe that the biases and observational limitations present in the data do not alter the interpretation of the physical processes at work in liner nuclei .",
    "this paper has described an infrared spectroscopic survey of 12 `` classical '' liner galaxies .",

    "the major results are :    1 .",
    "[ feii ] and h@xmath2 are the strongest infrared lines in classical liners . using extrapolated h@xmath11 line strengths from the optical , approximately half of the classical liners have ratios of [ feii]/pa@xmath1 and/or h@xmath2/br@xmath3 a factor of two or more higher than typical seyfert galaxies and a factor of five or more higher than typical starburst galaxies . 2 .",
    "a natural subdivision between the liners occurs at [ feii]/pa@xmath1 = 2 . the four `` strong '' [ feii ] liners exhibit evidence for recent or ongoing star formation . as a group ,",
    "the [ feii ] emission in these liners is consistent with shock excitation from compact supernova remnants .",
    "the five `` weak '' [ feii ] liners have more in common with seyfert galaxies , including the only two objects in the sample with broad h@xmath5 ( ngc  3998 and ngc  4258 )",
    ". the lower [ feii]/pa@xmath1 and h@xmath2/br@xmath3 ratios of `` weak '' [ feii ] liners are consistent with hard x - ray heating from a power - law source .",
    "neither excitation mechanism is ruled out for either type of object , however , and it is possible that it is just the relative strengths of the two mechanisms that are different in the two groups .",
    "3 .   in most of the liners , the estimated amount of pa@xmath1 absorption from the stellar population can account for the lack of pa@xmath1 detected in emission .",
    "several of the liners have unusually strong pa@xmath1 absorption ( @xmath42@xmath45 eqw ) indicative of younger stellar populations .",
    "the five galaxies with the strongest absorption all have strong [ feii ] lines and supernova remnants from recent star formation are a plausible explanation for their enhanced [ feii ] strengths .",
    "a strong linear correlation is observed between h@xmath2/br@xmath3 , [ feii]/pa@xmath1 and [ oi]/h@xmath5 for a range of 100 in all ratios and for all of the observed galaxy types .",
    "however , the `` strong '' [ feii ] liners are stronger in [ feii ] than the correlation with [ oi ] predicts .",
    "both the h@xmath2/br@xmath3 and to a lesser degree the [ feii]/pa@xmath1 ratio , appear to separate the three galaxy classes : liners , seyferts and starbursts .",
    "only six objects have been observed to have h@xmath2/br@xmath3 higher than 3 , and all are liners . in conjunction with the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratio , the class distinctions are even clearer .",
    "the shallow far infrared spectral slopes of some of the `` weak '' [ feii ] liners in comparison to the strengths of h@xmath2 and [ oi ] , appear inconsistent with the correlations observed for starburst and ulirg galaxies .",
    "this argues very strongly that a nonthermal heat source is providing much of the dust heating and line excitation for these objects .",
    "liners with x - ray detections appear to have sufficient x - ray luminosity to power the observed infrared lines .",
    "starbursts often have [ feii ] and h@xmath2 lines many times stronger than the x - rays luminosity should be able to produce . again",
    "the strong x - ray liners do not appear consistent with star formation , but instead behave like mini - seyferts .",

    "ngc  404 has the largest [ feii ] line to continuum ratio for any of the liners in this sample .",
    "it is plausible that the estimated pa@xmath1 flux is too high and that the calculated [ feii]/pa@xmath1 flux is significantly higher than the value of 2.7 in table 3 .",
    "even with this large estimated pa@xmath1 flux , ngc  404 has one of the highest ratios of [ feii ] to pa@xmath1 of any extragalactic object .",
    "the apparent feature at the location of br@xmath3 is due to residual ripple in the g star spectrum used to remove telluric absorption which is most apparent in ngc  404 because it is at essentially zero redshift .",
    "since the expected br@xmath3 is below the detection limit , and there is an obvious explanation for the feature , we do not regard this as a real detection of br@xmath3 in ngc  404 .",

    "it is an interesting possibility that the emission within ngc  404 could be generated in a single snr in a high density medium .",
    "the pa@xmath1 absorption correction , estimated in subsection 3.2 is about a factor of two too low to explain why pa@xmath1 is undetected .",
    "the most obvious explanation is that ngc  404 contains a significant population of young stars which increase the amount of balmer absorption .",
    "this is supported by keel ( 1983 ) , who considered ngc  404 a peculiar member of the liner class due to the presence of a blue continuum and strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "ngc  404 shows none of the infrared atomic absorption features seen in some of the other galaxies in this sample .",
    "the optical spectrum , ( filippenko and sargent , 1985 ) also shows a relatively smooth continuum spectrum .",
