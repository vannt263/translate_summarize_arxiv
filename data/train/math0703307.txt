    "an important issue in the theory of computing is noise , as almost all computational processes are effected by it . by the word noise",
    ", we would like to represent all kinds of errors occurring in a process , due to both humans and machines , including errors in measuring , errors caused by truncations , errors committed in transmitting and inputting the data , etc .",
    "it happens frequently that while we are interested in a solving a certain equation , because of the noise the computer actually ends up with solving a slightly perturbed version of it .",
    "our work is motivated by the following phenomenon , proposed by spielman and teng @xcite    if the input is a matrix , we can reformulate this in a more quantitative way as follows    the crucial point here is that @xmath0 itself may have large condition number .",
    "the above phenomenon gives an explanation to the fact ( which has been observed numerically for some time ",

    "this is a natural assumption for random variables involved in digital processes . on the other hand ,",
    "very little has been known , prior to this paper , about this case .",
    "random discrete matrices are indeed much more difficult to analyze than their continuous counterparts and our analysis is significantly different from those used earlier for the continuous models . in particular , it relies heavily on a new development in additive combinatorics , the so - called inverse littlewood - offord theory ( see section [ tools ] ) .",

    "the rough idea behind their argument is as follows . even if the input @xmath144 is the worst - case one ( which , in theory , would require a long running time ) , because of the noise , the computer actually works on some slightly randomly perturbed version of @xmath144 .",
    "next , one would show that the running time on a slightly randomly perturbed input , with high probability , is much smaller than the worst - case one .",
    "the smooth complexity of an algorithm is the maximum over its input of the expected running time of the algorithm under slight perturbations of that input .",
    "the puzzling question here is , of course : why the perturbed input is typically better than the original ( worst - case ) one ? in some sense , the `` magic '' lies in the phenomenon * p1*. the random noise guarantees that the condition number of the perturbed input is small ( so the perturbed input is likely to be well conditioned ) , no matter how ill conditioned the original input may be .",

    "this step has now been accomplished in this paper . however , these estimates themselves are not always sufficient .",
    "to be more specific , the situation looks as follows :    * there are problems where an efficient bound on the condition number leads directly to an efficient complexity bound . in such a situation , we obtain a smooth complexity bound with discrete noise in the obvious manner .",
    "this seems to be the case , e.g. , with the problems involving the gaussian elimination in @xcite . in the proofs in @xcite ,",
    "the critical fact was that all @xmath165 minors of a random perturbed matrix are all well conditioned , with high probability .",
    "this can be obtained using our results combined with the union bound ( see the remark after theorem [ theorem : conditiontv ] ) .",
    "* there are situations where beside the estimate on the condition number , further properties of the noise is used .",
    "an important example is the simplex method in linear programming . in the smooth analysis of this algorithm with gaussian noise @xcite",
    ", the fact that the distribution is continuous was exploited at several places .",
    "thus , even with the discrete version of the condition number estimates in hand , it is still not clear to us how to obtain a smooth complexity bound with discrete noise in this problem .",

    "this is the most difficult part of the proof , where we will need all the tools provided in section [ tools ] .",
    "informally , the strategy is to use the inverse littlewood - offord theorem to place the integers @xmath314 in a progression , which we then discretize using theorem [ discrete - thm ] .",
    "this allows us to replace the event @xmath315 by some dependence event involving the columns of @xmath4 , whose probability is very small by the strong linear independence assumption of the theorem .",

    "as each of the @xmath329 has absolute value at most @xmath330 , the number of ways to fix these exceptional elements is at most @xmath331 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath383 by the definition of @xmath349 .",
    "thus there is a unique value for the right - hand side , call it @xmath384 , which depends only on @xmath90 and @xmath193 such that    @xmath385    the point is that we have now eliminated the @xmath386 errors , and have thus essentially converted the singular value problem to a problem about dependence . note also that since one of the @xmath387 is known to have magnitude at least @xmath221 ( which will be much larger than @xmath388 given that we set @xmath389 ) , we see that at least one of the @xmath390 is non - zero .",

    "we now give an explanation to remark [ remark : frozen ] .",
    "this remark is based on the fact that in the previous proof one is allowed to have as many as @xmath394 coordinates outside the set @xmath395 , for any positive constant @xmath396 . indeed",
    ", these extra coordinates contribute a factor of @xmath397 which is @xmath332 .",
