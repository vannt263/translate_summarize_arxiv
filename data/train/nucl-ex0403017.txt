    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions at the highest available rhic energies , the ratio of yields of antiparticles to particles reaches the highest values yet observed .",
    "even the baryon ratios @xmath4 and @xmath3 reach values near unity , indicating an almost net baryon free environment at mid  rapidity .",
    "the antiparticle to particle ratios are observed to be flat as a function of rapidity ( @xmath5 ) close to mid ",
    "rapidity @xcite .",
    "away from mid ",
    "rapidity , the baryon content of the beam nuclei comes into play , and , in addition to particle ",
    "antiparticle pair production , other processes contribute significantly to the particle production .",
    "measurements by the brahms collaboration @xcite show a significant drop of @xmath4 in au+au collisions starting at @xmath6",
    ". in asymmetric collision systems , measurements at lower energies by na49 with p+pb collisions show different contributions of baryon number transfer for projectile and target rapidity regions due to multiple collisions suffered by the projectile nucleon , but not by the target @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "first preliminary measurements of @xmath3 at @xmath7 in d+au collisions are presented .",
    "candidates ( including @xmath8 background ) for both ftpcs . the rapidity range used for the present analysis",
    "is shown as the shaded histogram.,width=302 ]    the two radial  drift forward time projection chambers ( ftpcs ) @xcite of the star @xcite experiment permit the study of charged hadrons at forward rapidity in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this extends the acceptance of the spectrometer towards the fragmentation region and gives access to phenomena away from mid  rapidity .",
    "however , the ftpcs measure a maximum of 10 hits per track , which makes particle identification via energy loss measurements impossible with the current state of detector calibrations .",
    "the two ftpcs west ( positive rapidity ) and east ( negative rapidity ) of the interaction point in star are well located to study asymmetries in d+au collisions . in the 2003 d+au beam time",
    ", the deuterons were entering star from the east , gold from the west .",
    "hence the particle multiplicity in ftpc east is higher than in west , since particles produced from the gold nucleons preferentially continue towards the east .",
    "since the measurable decay mode of the @xmath0 is @xmath9 ( with a branching ratio of 64% ) , the lack of particle identification makes the use of all positive particles as @xmath10 candidates for the @xmath0 case or all negative particles as @xmath11 for the @xmath1 case necessary .",
    "this introduces a considerable background to the measurement .",
    "strict geometric cuts on the assumed daughter tracks and the resulting @xmath0 candidate help to reduce the background .",
    "the most important cuts were on the distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the primary vertex of the daughters , which should be relatively small for the @xmath10 candidate and large for the @xmath12 candidate , and cuts on the dca and the decay length of the resulting @xmath0 candidate .",
    "the major source of background remaining after these cuts is estimated to be from @xmath13 , where one of the two daughter pions is assumed to be a proton .",
    "for the current analysis a full geant detector simulation with a hijing @xcite generated @xmath8 distribution in @xmath14 and @xmath5 was used to predicted this background produced by making the wrong mass assumption for one of the two daughters .",
    "although the analysis presented here does not correct the yields for acceptance and efficiency , simulation studies show that the corrections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equal to first order .",
    "this permits the calculation of antiparticle to particle ratios without the knowledge of the absolute yield .",
    "the resulting ratios are not corrected for absorption or annihilation of the @xmath0 or its daughter particles in the detector material . due to the high momentum of the particles in forward direction ,",
    "absorption effects are small .",
    "simulations show them to be less than 2% , which is of the same order as the statistical error of the study .",
    "for the current analysis , a sample of 10.6 million d+au minimum bias events with a reconstructed primary vertex within 50 cm of the nominal interaction point are used .    with the assumption that all candidates that pass the cuts are actually @xmath0s , their rapidity can be calculated .",
    "this still includes all background that remains after the geometrical cuts .",
    "figure [ fig : lambdarapidity ] shows the total rapidity acceptance of the analysis for both detectors and the used range within @xmath15 0.25 of the mean rapidity .",
    "the rapidity slice used for the analysis is limited to 0.5 units because hijing simulations predict a strong rapidity dependence of @xmath3 in the region of interest , which would affect the measurement if a wide range of rapidities is included in one bin .",
    "in addition , the @xmath14 acceptance of the ftpcs is constant as a function of the pseudorapidity @xmath16 , not as a function of @xmath5 . in a wide analysis window in @xmath5",
    "the covered @xmath14 changes considerably over the selected @xmath5 range , and a possible @xmath14 dependence of the ratio would make the interpretation of the results more difficult , especially if this dependence is different for the deuteron and the gold side of the collision .",
    "figure [ fig : lambdainvariant ] a ) shows in black the invariant mass distribution of all positive  negative pairs with 0.4 gev / c @xmath17 1.5 gev / c that fulfill the geometric cuts in ftpc west with the assumption that positive tracks are protons and negative tracks are pions .",
    "the red curve is the estimated background from wrongly identified kaons , which is normalized to the integral of the invariant mass distribution in the range from 1.3 gev / c@xmath18 to 2.0 gev / c@xmath18 .",
    "this background is subtracted bin by bin and leads to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 invariant mass distributions shown for both detectors in figure [ fig : lambdainvariant ] b ) and [ fig : lambdainvariant ] c ) .",
    "the widths of the peaks are in agreement with simulations and due to the limited momentum resolution of the ftpcs , especially for tracks not originating from the primary vertex . from these invariant mass distributions",
    "the uncorrected yields and the statistical errors for @xmath0 and @xmath1 at forward and backward rapidity are determined by summing all bins 1.08 gev / c@xmath19 1.18 gev / c@xmath18 .",
    "the systematic errors have not been investigated in detail yet . from a variation of cuts and background estimations",
    "they are predicted to be 0.12 for this preliminary analysis .",
    "since possible remaining background contributions tend to be equal for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , an asymmetry of the systematic errors towards lower values of the ratio appears likely , but has not yet been thoroughly investigated .",
    "the derived antiparticle to particle ratios are compared with the ratios given by the hijing event generator .",
    "the mean rapidity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 candidates on the deuteron side ( ftpc w ) is  = 2.69 .",
    "the analysis yields a ratio of @xmath20(stat)@xmath21(syst ) . on the gold side ( ftpc e )  = -2.72 , with a ratio @xmath22(stat)@xmath21(syst ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] shows @xmath3 from hijing without taking detector effects into account .",
    "it has been shown by measurements in au+au collisions at @xmath23 gev @xcite that the pure hijing model tends to underestimate the influence of baryon number transport , and thus overestimates the antibaryon / baryon ratio .",
    "overlaid in red are the star points , the mid  rapidity value being 0.84 , determined from a preliminary analysis of main tpc data .",
    "the data show good agreement with hijing on the deuteron side , while on the gold side , hijing appears to overestimate the ratio .",
    "ratio as a function of rapidity .",
    "the three star points are compared with hijing calculations .",
    "the statistical errors are shown as the vertical bars , systematic errors ( estimated to be 0.12 in the ftpcs ) are indicated by the small horizontal lines .",
    "the horizontal error bars show the bin width in @xmath5 used to extract the ratio , width=302 ]    @xmath3 shows a significant drop at high rapidity , probably due to baryon number conservation and fragmentation contributions to the @xmath0 production .",
    "the asymmetry of the ratio in the highly asymmetric collision system may be caused by different contributions of pair production and baryon number transport in the projectile and the target region .",
    "while the participating nucleons in the gold nucleus typically suffer only a single collision each , the nucleons from the deuteron participate in multiple collisions as they pass through the gold nucleus .",
    "this can lead to increased baryon number transport from the deuteron region towards mid  rapidity and thus results in a decrease of @xmath3 in the studied rapidity range .",
    "first preliminary measurements of @xmath3 at high rapidity in d+au collisions at @xmath24 = 200 gev using the forward tpcs of the star experiment have been presented .",
    "an asymmetry between the deuteron and the gold side of the collision is seen , indicating different contributions of antiparticle and particle production mechanisms and baryon number transport in the forward region . in general , the ratios at high rapidity are lower than at mid  rapidity .",
    "future studies will compare to a wider range of theoretical models and use a variety of background models and cut sets .",
    "a binning of the analysis in collision centrality , rapidity or @xmath25 might also be feasible .",
