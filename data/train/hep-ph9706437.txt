    "nlo corrections to two - jet production including @xmath9 and @xmath11 exchange will be available soon . both programs allow to study arbitrary experimental cuts and jet definition schemes .",
    "previous calculations  @xcite were limited to a jade type algorithm and important single jet - mass effects were neglected . because of the disagreement with these earlier calculations a comparison of the two new calculations is particularly important .    in table",
    "[ table_comp ] we compare results from mepjet and disent for 2- and 3-jet rates at hera ( @xmath12  gev , @xmath13  gev ) in the @xmath14-scheme with @xmath15 and a hard scattering scale @xmath16 .",

    "the internal structure of jets is first modeled at nlo where two massless partons may be recombined to form a jet .",
    "the dependence of jet cross sections on the details of the internal jet structure can be investigated by studying different recombination schemes : the @xmath25-scheme where parton 4-momenta are added to form massive jet 4-momenta , and the @xmath26 and @xmath27-schemes in which the jets are made massless by rescaling either the 3-momentum or the energy of the resulting cluster .",
    "we use mepjet for numerical studies with mrs d- parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are set to one half the sum of parton transverse momenta in the breit frame .",
    "a minimal set of kinematical cuts is imposed .",
    "we require 40  gev@xmath28 gev@xmath20 , @xmath29 , an energy cut of @xmath30  gev on the scattered lepton , and pseudo - rapidities @xmath31 for the scattered lepton and jets .",

    "in addition , jets are required to have a minimal transverse momentum of 5 gev in the breit frame .",
    "iii ) the @xmath11-scheme where parton / cluster pairs ( including the proton remnant ) with invariant mass squared , @xmath34 are recombined  @xcite .",

    "another disadvantage of the @xmath11 and jade schemes is their strong recombination scheme dependence . since even in a nlo calculation",
    "the internal structure of a jet is only calculated at tree level , these strong variations point to large uncertainties from two - loop effects in the @xmath11 and jade schemes . in both schemes widely separated but relatively soft partons tend to be clustered to what is then defined as a jet , even though these clusters can be very massive and quite distinct from the pencil - like and low - mass objects which one starts out with in the parton model or at lo  @xcite .",
    "these differences then result in the large higher order corrections to jet cross sections shown in table  [ table_dijet ] .",
    "these effects are much smaller in the cone and the @xmath14 schemes which are hence favored for precision qcd studies in dis .",
    "recently much interest has been focused on the small bjorken-@xmath4 region , where one would like to distinguish bfkl evolution  @xcite , which resums the leading @xmath39 terms , from the more traditional dglap evolution equation  @xcite , which resums leading @xmath40 terms .",
    "bfkl evolution can be enhanced and dglap evolution suppressed by studying dis events which contain an identified jet of longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath41 ( in the proton direction ) which is large compared to bjorken @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "when tagging a forward jet with @xmath0 this leaves little room for dglap evolution while the condition @xmath1 leaves bfkl evolution active .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of the forward jet production cross section proportional to @xmath42 over the dglap expectation .",
    "= 4.0 in = 3.0 in    a conventional fixed order qcd calculation up to @xmath5 does not yet contain any bfkl resummation and must be considered a background for its detection ; one must search for an enhancement in the forward jet production cross section above the expectation for two- and three - parton final states .",
    "the full calculation of the forward jet inclusive cross section in dis , at @xmath5 , has been performed in ref .",
    "ordinarily , such a calculation would contain 3-parton final states at tree level , 1-loop corrections to 2-parton final states and 2-loop corrections to 1-parton final states .",
    "however , these 2-loop contributions vanish identically , once the condition @xmath43 is imposed . the remaining 2-parton and 3-parton differential cross sections , and the cancellation of divergences between them , are the same as those entering a calculation of 2-jet inclusive rates .",
    "these elements are already implemented in the mepjet program , which , therefore , can be used to determine the inclusive forward jet cross section at @xmath5 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1comp ] numerical results are compared with recent data from h1  @xcite . here the conditions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are satisfied by selecting events with forward jets ( in the angular region @xmath44 ) with @xmath45 clearly h1 observes substantially more forward jet events than expected from nlo qcd . however , since h1 accepted jets of rather low transverse momentum , @xmath46  gev , the comparison of our parton level calculation to the data may be subject to sizable hadronization corrections .",
    "a recent bfkl calculation  @xcite ( dashed histogram ) agrees better with the data , but here the overall normalization is uncertain and the agreement may be fortuitous .",
    "a very rough estimate of the uncertainty of the nlo calculation is provided by the two dotted lines which correspond to variations by a factor 10 of the renormalization and factorization scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "very similar results are found by zeus  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the hera data show evidence for bfkl dynamics in forward jet events via an enhancement in the observed forward jet cross section above nlo expectations .",
    "however , additional data , with harder forward jets , are needed to make the comparison of qcd calculations with data more reliable .",
