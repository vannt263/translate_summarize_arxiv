    "in this paper we study axial gravitational perturbations of an infinite static line source , represented by a form of the levi - civita metric @xcite , given by thorne @xcite .",
    "this metric has been used and studied in many instances , including also the possibility of time dependence , but keeping the cylindrical symmetry of the metric . in this case",
    "the gravitational perturbations depend only on time and the radial coordinate , and correspond to a form of einstein - rosen waves @xcite .",
    "analysis where the cylindrical symmetry is broken have appeared only recently @xcite , but restricted to the evolution of scalar , or maxwell test fields , in the field of the static line source .",
    "the main scope of these studies was directed at elucidating the relation between the classical and quantum nature of the naked singularity present in the background metric .",
    "our aim here is different .",
    "what we want to study is if , given the presence of the naked singularity , even after imposing appropriate boundary conditions , the gravitational perturbations contain an unstable component , as has previously been shown to happen for the negative mass schwarzschild @xcite , and super extreme reissner - nordstrom and kerr black holes@xcite .",
    "as is shown here , we also find in this case unstable modes .",
    "we remark again that , as is the case in both @xcite , and @xcite , the instability is a consequence of the shape of a related `` potential '' away from the singularity , and , therefore , it is possible that it remains even after the ( curvature ) singularity is smoothed out by spreading the source over a small region .",
    "the study of that possibility is , however , outside the scope of the present research .",
    "as indicated , the perturbations we consider here are restricted to axial symmetry but break the cylindrical symmetry of the background metric . in section iii",
    "we analyze the gauge issues that arise in setting up the appropriate form of the perturbed metric and show that it is possible to restrict to diagonal terms , but that this does not fix the gauge completely .",
    "we analyze in detail the gauge ambiguity remaining after imposing the diagonal form , and show that some of this may be removed by restricting to perturbations that are effectively of compact support .",
    "we find several gauge invariants that are used later in the analysis .",
    "we derive in the perturbation equations in section iv , and in section v we show that they can be solved by solving a third order ordinary differential equation for an appropriately chosen function of the perturbed metric coefficients .",
    "the set of solutions of this equation contains gauge trivial parts , and we show how to extract the gauge non trivial components .",
    "we introduce appropriate boundary conditions on the solutions in section vi and show that these lead to a boundary value problem that determines the allowed functional forms of the perturbation modes .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues determine a sort of `` dispersion relation '' for the frequencies and corresponding `` wave vector '' components . since we not have analytic solutions we use a numerical approach to determine approximate values for eigenvalues and approximate functional form of the eigenfunctions , for a set of background metrics .",
    "the central result of this analysis is that the resulting spectrum of allowed frequencies contains one unstable ( imaginary frequency ) mode for every possible choice of the background metric .",
    "the completeness of the mode expansion in relation to the initial value problem and the gauge problem is discussed in detail in section vii , and we show that the perturbations contain an unstable component for generic initial data .",
    "this result implies that the levi - civita space times are gravitationally unstable .",
    "we close the paper in section viii with some final comments .",
    "the metric of a static solution line source may be written in the form @xcite , @xmath0 where in general we have : @xmath1 with @xmath2 , and @xmath3 arbitrary constants that can be reset by changing the scales of @xmath4 , while @xmath5 is a positive constant related to the mass per unit length of the line source . without loss of generality and mostly for simplicity we will set @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the rest of this paper .",
    "the metric ( [ ateq1 ] ) may be thought of as the vacuum metric outside of a massive cylinder , in the limit where the radius of the cylinder goes to zero , but the mass per unit length is kept fixed at some finite value .",
    "notice that in the original form of the metric , analyzed , for instance in @xcite , the metric contains a parameter @xmath8 , for which the line source interpretation is possible only for @xmath9 .",
    "one can check that this range corresponds to @xmath10 .",
    "in this paper we consider perturbations that preserve the axial symmetry . these correspond to terms in the metric that depend only on @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and",
    "@xmath13 . if we call @xmath14 the static metric given by ( [ ateq1 ] ) and ( [ ateq2 ] ) , and @xmath15 the perturbation , the perturbed metric @xmath16 is given by , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the perturbation parameter , and we will consider all expression only up to first order in @xmath18 .",
    "we restrict the perturbations @xmath15 to axial symmetry , and set @xmath19 if one ( but not both ) of the indices corresponds to @xmath20 . this implies , in principle that we have seven independent functions for @xmath15 , but we may use the freedom to change the @xmath21 coordinates also to first order in @xmath18 to restrict to only diagonal terms . in more detail , we consider a ( linearized ) change of coordinates change of the form , @xmath22 then , the off - diagonal terms in ( [ equ01 ] ) become , @xmath23 then , setting all the left hand sides in ( [ gp04 ] ) to zero , we get a set of equations for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 than can be straightforwardly solved for any choice of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . on this account ,",
    "we take for the perturbed metric the form , @xmath30    unfortunately , imposing the vanishing of the off - diagonal terms does not fix the gauge completely , and , therefore , ( [ gp05 ] ) is not unique .",
    "it is easy to get the most general transformation of the form ( [ gp02 ] ) that preserves the diagonal form ( [ gp05 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding coordinate transformation functions can be written in the form , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are arbitrary independent functions of the indicated arguments .",
    "if we consider the transformations generated by each one of these functions separately , starting with the background ( order zero ) metric , we have three cases the arguments may be taken as @xmath35 or @xmath36 indistinctly , as this leads to differences that are of second order in @xmath18 ] :      in this case we have to consider general perturbations that depend only on @xmath41 , and , therefore , preserve the cylindrical symmetry of the unperturbed metric .",
    "the gauge independent part corresponds to cylindrical gravitational waves and will be excluded here , as we are interested only in perturbations that break that symmetry . from the point of view of the initial value problem , they correspond to initial data independent of @xmath13 , and , therefore can be excluded by simply considering only initial data that is compactly supported in both @xmath13 , and @xmath12 .",
    "this case corresponds to static perturbations ( independent of @xmath11 ) , i.e. , `` zero '' modes .",
    "we first explore the general solution of the linearized einstein equations by assuming for the perturbations the form , @xmath44 replacing in the linearized einstein equations we find that , @xmath45 and , @xmath46 there is only one further independent equation that can be written in the form , @xmath47 where , @xmath48 thus , the general @xmath11 independent solution is determined by a solution of ( [ scrz07 ] ) plus an arbitrary function of @xmath49 . to see the relation of this result to the gauge ambiguities we notice that under a coordinate transformation where only @xmath43",
    ", we have that the relevant functions @xmath50 transform as , @xmath51 the transformation law for @xmath52 and @xmath53 implies that the function @xmath54 is gauge invariant , and , therefore , it represents a gauge non trivial perturbation . to analyze this in more detail",
    ", we notice that if we write , @xmath55 then , @xmath56 satisfies the equation , @xmath57 whose general solution is , @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , are constants , and @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are modified bessel functions of the first and second kind , respectively .",
    "but , given the properties of these functions , this result implies that there are no gauge invariant , time independent perturbations that are finite in both limits @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we may again exclude them by restricting to initial data of compact support in both @xmath49 .",
    "this type of transformation is relevant in the general problem where the perturbations effectively depend on @xmath36 .",
    "the result of applying it on the perturbed metric ( [ gp05 ] ) is , @xmath66    since this preserves the general form ( [ gp05 ] ) , any result obtained by solving einstein s equations for the @xmath50 will be subject to a gauge ambiguity .",
    "nevertheless , we may extract from ( [ sc03 ] ) the following gauge invariant quantities , @xmath67 actually , these three functions are not independent , and we have , @xmath68    its implications in deriving relevant physical conclusions will be considered in the following sections .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , we may restrict the perturbations to diagonal terms . furthermore , since the unperturbed metric depends only on @xmath12 , and the equations are linear , it will be appropriate to assume that the dependence on @xmath11 and @xmath13 is only through a factor @xmath69 , with the most general solution a linear combination of the resulting solutions .",
    "thus we take for the perturbed metric the form , @xmath70 where , as usual , it is understood that one should take only the real part of the full complex expression .",
    "we next impose that ( [ equ02 ] ) satisfies the vacuum einstein equations to first order in @xmath18 .",
    "this leads in general to a set of coupled second order ordinary differential equations for the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , but it is easy to show that we must have , @xmath73 and one can reduce the rest of the system to the following set of coupled first order equations , @xmath74    what we have in mind here is that , with appropriate boundary conditions , the set of solutions of ( [ equ10 ] ) , together with the @xmath75 factors , will provide a basis for an expansion of arbitrary functions of @xmath49 , leading to the formal solution of the initial value problem for the perturbations . on this account we may look at ( [ equ10 ] ) as a boundary value problem that determines the allowed values of @xmath76 , such that the boundary conditions are satisfied . as we show in the next section , it turns out to be convenient for this purpose to change ( [ equ10 ] ) to an equation for a single function , that satisfies a third order ordinary differential equation .",
    "an issue that will also require further discussion is that of the gauge dependence of the solutions .",
    "considering again the system ( [ equ10 ] ) , we notice that , if we are interested in the initial value problem for the perturbations , in particular if we are considering the possibility of unstable modes , then , the question is : given @xmath5 and @xmath77 , are there solutions with acceptable values of @xmath76",
    "? that is , are there values of @xmath76 such that the solutions satisfy appropriate boundary conditions ? this is a standard boundary value problem , but it is not easy to handle if given in the form ( [ equ10 ] ) . a simpler problem is obtained if introduce two new functions , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , such that , @xmath80 then , using ( [ equ10 ] ) repeatedly , we find , @xmath81 while for @xmath82 we find the equation , @xmath83 where , @xmath84    it may appear rather unexpected that ( [ gs06 ] ) has an exact solution given by , @xmath85 notice that ( [ gs08 ] ) is independent of @xmath76 . one can show , however , following the discusion in section iii.c , that this solution is a consequence of the gauge ambiguity intrinsic in the system ( [ equ10 ] ) . to see how this happens we recall that @xmath82 is defined up to constant and write , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an arbitrary function of @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . replacing in ( [ gs02 ] ) , and ( [ gs04 ] ) , we find , ( recall that @xmath88 ) , @xmath89 upon multiplication by @xmath90 and integration on @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we recover the full @xmath36 dependence , and we get , @xmath91 where , @xmath92 but a comparison with ( [ sc03 ] ) immediately shows that this solution is pure gauge and should be discarded .",
    "nevertheless , we may use it to look for solutions of ( [ gs06 ] ) of the form , @xmath93 replacing in ( [ gs06 ] ) , we find that @xmath94 satisfies the equation , @xmath95\\frac{dh_1}{dr } \\nonumber \\\\     & & = \\omega^2 \\frac{dh_1}{dr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to simplify further the treatment , we introduce a new function @xmath96 such that , @xmath97 where , @xmath98 replacing in ( [ gs12 ] ) we get an equation for @xmath96 of the form , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a function of @xmath12 , @xmath5 , and @xmath77",
    ". it will be convenient to introduce a further change of variable and a new function given by , @xmath101 and we find that @xmath102 satisfies the equation , @xmath103 where , @xmath104 and , @xmath105\\\\   & & \\times\\left[4 x^2\\left(x^{2(1+\\kappa)^2}+\\kappa(2+\\kappa)\\right)^2\\right]^{-1 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can not fail to notice that ( [ gs22 ] ) has the form of a `` dispersion relation '' ( @xmath106 ) , that changes with @xmath107 .",
    "we remark , however , that @xmath77 is not the modulus of the `` wave vector '' . in principle",
    ", one can understand ( [ gs22 ] ) as resulting from the interference between a traveling wave part in the @xmath13 direction and a standing wave in the radial direction that characterize the modes described by @xmath108 + equation ( [ gs20 ] ) has the typical form of an eigenvalue - eigenfunction equation .",
    "we first need to establish the general behaviour of its solutions both for @xmath109 , and @xmath110 . since ( [ gs20 ] ) is a second order ordinary differential equation , it has two independent solutions .",
    "let us consider first @xmath63 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that near @xmath111 , the general solution of ( [ gs20 ] ) admits an asymptotic expansion of the form , @xmath112\\ ] ] or , in more detail , up to leading order terms in @xmath113 , @xmath114   + \\dots \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dots indicate higher terms .",
    "all the @xmath115 coefficients are proportional to @xmath116 , and the @xmath117 are linear homogeneous in @xmath118 , and @xmath116 .",
    "this implies that we have two sets of independent solutions that can be selected by choosing either @xmath119 or @xmath120 . in the first case , ( @xmath119 ) ,",
    "the solutions behave as @xmath121 as @xmath109 , and in the second , ( @xmath120 ) , the solutions behave as @xmath122 as @xmath109 .    in accordance with ( [ gs10 ] ) , ( [ gs14 ] ) ,",
    "( [ gs16 ] ) , and ( [ gs18 ] ) , we have that the general solution of ( [ gs06 ] ) may be written in the form , @xmath123\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the general solution of ( [ gs20 ] ) , and @xmath124 is a constant . with this result and the expansion ( [ gs28 ] )",
    ", we conclude that besides the solution ( [ gs08 ] ) , @xmath78 has two other linearly independent solutions , which , near @xmath111 , and up to terms of order @xmath125 , may be written in the form , @xmath126\\ ] ] where @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 depend on @xmath76 and @xmath5 , and are finite .",
    "thus we get one solution that is finite for @xmath111 by setting @xmath131 , and an independent solution that diverges as @xmath132 by setting @xmath133 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath102 for large @xmath113 is more difficult to establish , and we have not been able to obtain asymptotic expansions similar to ( [ gs26 ] ) or ( [ gs28 ] ) .",
    "we nevertheless notice that for large @xmath113 we have , @xmath134 and we may approximate ( [ gs20 ] ) by , @xmath135 the general solution of this equation is , @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are modified bessel functions . actually ( [ gs54 ] ) is consistent only if we keep the leading terms .",
    "therefore , for @xmath110 we have two linearly independent solutions for @xmath102 , whose leading terms are , @xmath139    we need to establish now what boundary conditions should be considered acceptable . in principle , we expect a perturbation to be finite everywhere and that it should be possible to make it arbitrarily smaller than the background . on this account ,",
    "considering ( [ gs40 ] ) , the only acceptable solutions for @xmath63 are those where we take the solution for @xmath108 that vanishes as @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .    to analyze the behaviour for large @xmath12 we write ( [ gs40 ] ) , ( with @xmath141 ) , in the form , @xmath142 where , @xmath143    therefore , if we impose the condition that @xmath102 should vanish for @xmath110 , the integral @xmath144 will be finite , and as @xmath110 , the first term in ( [ gs40a ] ) vanishes , and the remaining term , in accordance with our previous discussion , is pure gauge .",
    "thus , we conclude that the appropriate boundary conditions for @xmath102 are , @xmath145    the consequences of these boundary conditions for @xmath108 on its spectrum , and therefore on the behaviour of the perturbations will be analyzed in the next section .",
    "as indicated in the previous section , we need to impose boundary conditions on @xmath78 to restrict to geometrically acceptable perturbations .",
    "this , in turn , imposes boundary conditions on @xmath102 .",
    "these conditions are that @xmath108 should go to zero for @xmath110 and that it should vanish as @xmath140 for @xmath109 .",
    "we recall that @xmath108 is a solution of ( [ gs20 ] ) . with the stated boundary conditions the operator on the left of ( [ gs20 ] ) is self - adjoint , and , since @xmath146 for @xmath147 , its spectrum ( i.e. the set of allowed values of @xmath107 ) is fully discrete .",
    "we may classify the corresponding eigenfunctions by the number of nodes @xmath148 , that is , the zeros of @xmath108 for @xmath149 , and indicate them as @xmath150 .",
    "we then have , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "since the spectrum is discrete , the eigenfunctions @xmath153 are real and can be normalized so that they satisfy the relations , @xmath154 with this normalization the set @xmath155 provides a complete orthonormal basis for the expansion of functions of @xmath113 in @xmath156 .",
    "we recall that , @xmath157 therefore , a negative @xmath107 corresponds to a pure imaginary value of @xmath76 , and this , in turn , to unstable perturbations that diverge exponentially in time . because of the rather involved dependence of @xmath158 on @xmath113 , it is not easy to determine analytically the details of the spectrum of @xmath107 .",
    "we may , nevertheless , resort to numerical methods to try to determine at least the lowest values of @xmath107 , remembering that they still depend on @xmath5 .    as a simple numerical approach we imposed on @xmath102 the boundary condition ( [ gs28 ] ) , with @xmath119 , and , using a `` shooting '' method",
    ", we solved the boundary value problem for ( [ ts02 ] ) for the lowest eigenvalues , finding approximate values for @xmath107 , and corresponding functional forms for @xmath102 , for several choices of @xmath5 .",
    "the results for @xmath159 and @xmath160 are shown in table i. +    .",
    "approximate values for @xmath159 and @xmath160 for several choices of @xmath5 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     some examples of the functional forms of @xmath102 are given in figure 1 , and the potential @xmath161 is plotted in figure 2 for several values of @xmath5 .",
    "it is apparent from these plots that @xmath161 is strongly dependent on @xmath5 , and this , in turn is reflected in the dependence of @xmath152 on @xmath5 .",
    "+    the most important feature of these results is that , in _ all _ cases considered , @xmath162 , and , therefore , we have shown that there is one _ unstable _ set of solution for the equations of motion for the perturbations for every value of @xmath163 in the range of @xmath5 considered .",
    "although we do not have analytic results , we may prove that this result must hold for any value of @xmath5 as follows .",
    "suppose that there is a solution of @xmath150 of ( [ ts02 ] ) with @xmath164 .",
    "this implies that @xmath165 for all @xmath77 , and , therefore , replacing in ( [ gs40 ] ) we would obtain a gauge non trivial , time independent solution , that is finite in both limits @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "but we have already shown that there are no such solutions , and , therefore , ( [ ts02 ] ) can not have solutions with @xmath166 , satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ gs40c ] ) .",
    "but all @xmath152 , and , in particular , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , are continuous functions of @xmath5 , and since they can not vanish for any @xmath5 , for all @xmath5 we must have @xmath162 , and @xmath167 , and we conclude that for all @xmath5 we have one , and only one negative eigenvalue @xmath107 .",
    "in this section we consider the initial value problem for the perturbed system , but , before we carry out this analysis we need to see in what way the general problem of evolution is solved once we determine the allowed functions @xmath108 and the corresponding spectrum of values of @xmath107 .",
    "let us consider again the functions @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .",
    "we have found that for every choice of @xmath77 , after imposing appropriate boundary conditions , we have an infinite set of solutions , each one characterized by a function @xmath150 and a value of @xmath152 .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath76 follow from ( [ ts06 ] ) .",
    "@xmath172 in what follows we shall call @xmath173 the quantity corresponding to taking the plus sign in ( [ ts06a ] ) , and add a minus sign explicitly when necessary .",
    "if we identify the corresponding metric coefficients as @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 , where we remark that these functions depend only on @xmath178 , we may construct more general solutions by taking linear combinations .",
    "for example , we would have , @xmath179 and similar expressions , with the same coefficients @xmath180 , for @xmath181 and @xmath182",
    ". we may invert partially ( [ ivp02 ] ) , multiplying by @xmath183 and integrating over @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , we may set @xmath184 in both the functions and their @xmath11 derivatives , and finally combine them as follows , @xmath185 and , @xmath186 then , if we define , @xmath187 we have , @xmath188    the functions @xmath189 do not satisfy orthonormality or other immediately useful conditions .",
    "nevertheless , if we go back to ( [ gs40 ] ) , with @xmath141 , we have , @xmath190 therefore , if we define , @xmath191 we have , @xmath192 and we may use the orthonormality of the @xmath150 to obtain , @xmath193 which can be used to solve for the coefficients @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , we may invert ( [ ivp02 ] ) and , given @xmath195 and @xmath196 , obtain the corresponding expansion coefficients .",
    "in fact , we only need @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "this immediately suggests that , given _ any _ solution @xmath201 of the perturbation equations , or , rather , of the initial value problem , we may use ( [ ivp18 ] ) to compute the coefficients @xmath194 and find the evolution of the system that results from that initial data .",
    "although this is conceptually correct , it requires closer examination .",
    "if we go back to ( [ ivp014 ] ) , we notice that the right hand sides act as projectors , since any portion of the initial data such that , @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are constants , will be deleted from the computation of the coefficients @xmath205 .",
    "but we have already notice that this type of functional dependence is pure gauge and can be eliminated by an appropriate coordinate transformation .",
    "we may understand this feature by noticing that for a single mode , the gauge invariant @xmath206 is given by , @xmath207 and , therefore , the functions @xmath208 are themselves gauge invariant , and an expansion of the form ( [ ivp02 ] ) , even if obtained from arbitrary initial data , evolves only the gauge non trivial part of the perturbation . in particular , any initial data that has non vanishing projection on @xmath209 will lead to a gauge non trivial unstable evolution , diverging exponentially in time .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the axial gravitational perturbations of an infinite line source , and , after imposing boundary conditions at the symmetry axis and at radial infinity , such that the perturbations , in the sense of initial data , can be made arbitrarily smaller than the background , we found the general solution of the corresponding linearized einstein equations .",
    "we analyzed also the problem of the gauge invariance of the solutions , and found a complete set of gauge non trivial solutions , with which we can describe the evolution of arbitrary initial data for the perturbations .",
    "the main result of our analysis is that the evolution will contain generically unstable components , and , therefore , that the space time considered here is gravitationally unstable .",
    "since this space time contains a naked singularity , one would be tempted to ascribe the instability to the presence of that singularity .",
    "we remark , however , that here , as in the cases considered in @xcite , and @xcite , the unstable mode is related to the form of a `` potential '' away from the singularity , indicating the possibility that the instability might remain even after smoothing the ( curvature ) singularity by considering an extended source . in the present case , we would have to consider a cylindrical regular source , such as an infinite cylinder of some kind of matter .",
    "the problem in this construction is that the resulting system is considerably more complex than the vacuum case considered here , since , asides from conditions that must be imposed at the matter - vacuum boundary , we must incorporate an equation of state for the matter , and the resulting appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the question , nevertheless , is interesting , but outside the scope of the present research .",

    "<S> we also include , for completeness , a set of approximate eigenvalues , and examples of the functional form of the solutions . </S>"
