    "the very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath3-ray sky has seen a dramatic increase in the number of sources , with 26 detected active galactic nuclei ( agns ) over redshifts of 0.0018 -0.536 .",
    "all , except two , are blazars with their jets closely aligned to our line of sight .",
    "blazars as a class are comprised of bl lacertae objects , optically violent variables and other radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "non - thermal emission dominates the broad - band continuum spectra of blazars .    the characteristic double - peaked spectral energy distribution of blazars is usually attributed to synchrotron radiation in the radio to x - ray wavebands , and inverse - compton up - scattering of soft target photons by relativistic electrons at gev and tev energies @xcite .",
    "alternative emission scenarios involve hadronic interactions producing neutral pions which decay into photons @xcite and proton synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the latter models provide a link between agns and possible sources of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays . a better understanding of the underlying acceleration and emission processes requires a larger sample of sources , which is now being provided by the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope ( _ fermi _ ) at 0.1  gev to hundreds of gev and by the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) , namely the magic , h.e.s.s . and veritas observatories , that provide coverage primarily in the @xmath4 regime .    to date , blazars detected at vhe energies are predominantly high - frequency peaked bl lacertae objects ( hbls ) .",
    "nevertheless , a few objects with lower peak energies , namely low - frequency - peaked bl lacertae ( lbls ; @xcite ) and intermediate - frequency - peaked bl lacertae objects ( ibls ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were detected recently by iacts at tev energies .",
    "the @xmath3-ray luminosity of lbls and ibls generally peaks at sub - gev to tens of gev in energy , and they are therefore easily detectable by _ fermi _ while their detectability in the tev regime by iacts is more difficult due to their soft vhe spectra .    among the hbls , which are typically the domain of the tev telescopes , a number of objects exhibit unusually hard intrinsic power law energy spectra ( @xmath5 ) after correcting for the @xmath6 absorption by the cosmological diffuse ebl radiation field .",
    "while the measured spectral indices , @xmath7 , of these blazars ( 1es  1101232 , 1es  0347121 , 1es  0229 + 200 , 1es  1218 + 304 , rgb  j0710 + 591 ) range from 2.5 to 3.1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the absorption - corrected spectral indices suggest very hard intrinsic source spectra in the vhe regime with @xmath8 @xcite , based on recent lower limits to the ebl from galaxy counts @xcite .",
    "similar hard energy spectra are found by _",
    "fermi _ , where , for example , the measured spectral indices for rgb  j0710 + 591 and 1es  1440 + 122 are found to be @xmath9 and @xmath10 over energies from 0.2 gev to tens of gev @xcite .",
    "while the findings of very hard vhe spectra are based on ebl constraints from galaxy counts , the _ fermi _ spectra directly resemble the intrinsic source spectra since absorption by the ebl is minimal for the covered energy range .",
    "the photon spectrum of 1es  1218 + 304 measured by _ fermi _ yields a spectral index of @xmath11 between 0.2  gev and @xmath12300  gev , but absorption may already play a role at the high - energy end @xcite .",
    "diffusive shock - acceleration theory ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) generally yields a limit to the spectral index of gev  tev photon spectra resulting from inverse compton scattering of @xmath13 . only recently , numerical studies by stecker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) indicate that sufficiently hard electron spectra could be generated by diffusive shock acceleration in relativistic shocks , for the production of photon spectra @xmath14 .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that even for a hard - spectrum electron population , in the framework of a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scenario , the resulting gev  tev @xmath3-ray spectra should experience substantial softening from klein ",
    "nishina effects making @xmath3-ray spectra with @xmath15 less likely .",
    "other approaches to explain the hard @xmath3-ray spectra are offered by ad hoc assumptions about the electron distribution , an additional absorption component in the source , or a postulate of new physics describing the propagation of @xmath3-rays on extragalactic distance scales .",
    "@xcite invoke a high low - energy cutoff in the electron distribution that could give the appearance of a hard @xmath3-ray spectrum for a given energy regime .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath16 absorption in the source due to a narrow - band emission component from the agn could lead to unusually hard vhe spectra .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested an axion like particle ( alp ) that would distort the @xmath3-ray spectrum through alp / photon mixing on cosmological distances in the presence of intergalactic magnetic fields .    a more easily testable model that involves known physics was recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "the authors attribute the hard photon spectra to inverse - compton up - scattering of ambient photons from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , occurring in a kiloparsec - scale jet . in this case , a substantial fraction of the jet power is transported by hadrons to the outer regions of the jet , where it is dissipated into ultra - relativistic electrons .",
    "inverse - compton scattering in the klein ",
    "nishina regime is no longer the limitation at the highest energies since low - energy target photons from the cmb are abundant .",
    "the low magnetic field in the large - scale jet also avoids the overproduction of synchrotron radiation and allows compton emission to dominate .",
    "furthermore , the synchrotron emission in the radio to x - ray wavebands is assumed to originate on sub - parsec scales .",
    "a similar mechanism was previously suggested to explain the hard x - ray spectra observed from the kiloparsec - scale jets of radio quasars @xcite .",
    "to date , all of the blazars exhibiting very hard spectra appear to emit at a baseline level that is consistent with this picture . however , it is also possible that the sensitivity of the current iacts is the limiting factor in detecting day scale variations and that the underlying emission may contain flares .",
    "the question as to whether or not the @xmath3-ray emission from 1es  1218 + 304 consists of flares or corresponds to a constant baseline emission level was one of the main motivations for veritas to monitor this object over a period of 5 months in the 2008/2009 season .",
    "the other motivation for deep exposures of relatively large redshift ( @xmath17 ) blazars at tev energies is to provide better constraints on the ebl spectrum .",
    "the observed vhe photon spectrum can be used to constrain the ebl in the near to mid - ir .",
    "this is particularly promising for hard - spectrum blazars that provide the best sensitivity to any possible absorption feature .",
    "veritas is an array of four 12 m iacts located at the base camp of the f.l .",
    "whipple observatory in southern arizona ( 3168n , 11095w , 1.3 km above sea level ) .",
    "each veritas focal plane instrument has a 35 field of view and consists of 499 photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the stereoscopic system has been fully operational since mid-2007 and is capable of detecting sources with a flux of 1% of the crab nebula in @xmath18 hr of observation . in summer 2009 ,",
    "telescope 1 was relocated and the improved array configuration allows us to detect a point source at 1% of the crab nebula flux under 30 hr of observations .",
    "the large effective area ( @xmath19 ) of the array enables veritas to be sensitive over a wide range of energies ( from 100 gev to 30 tev ) with an energy resolution of @xmath20 above 300 gev . for further details about veritas , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "1es  1218 + 304 was observed by veritas from 2008 december to 2009 may .",
    "all data were taken in _",
    "mode where the source is positioned 05 from the center of the camera in order to allow simultaneous background estimation .",

    "the @xmath3-ray - like events are separated from the cosmic ray background events using cuts on the _ mean - reduced - scaled length _ and _ mean - reduced - scaled width _ parameters ( see @xcite for a full description of the parameters ) .",
    "the cuts for @xmath3-ray / hadron separation are optimized a priori for a source with a 10% crab - like flux",
    ". a circular region of radius @xmath22 is applied around the target to estimate the on - source events .",
    "the background or off - source counts are estimated with off - source _ reflected regions _ @xcite .",
    "the significance of any excess ( on  off ) events is calculated following equation ( 17 ) in li & ma ( @xcite ) .",
    "the angular distribution of excess events from the direction of 1es  1218 + 304 ( figure  [ t2_fig ] ) is comparable with the expectation from the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of a point source .",
    "mc simulations are used to generate a lookup table for estimating the energies of the primary @xmath3-rays as a function of the image size and impact parameters .",
    "for spectral analysis , a looser cut ( _ spectrum cuts _ ) on the arrival direction of @xmath3-rays ( a region with @xmath23 ) is applied along with three off - source _ reflected - regions_. this has the benefit of retaining a higher number of @xmath3-ray candidates in addition to reducing the systematic uncertainties associated with the mc detector model . both the standard cuts ( @xmath24 ) and the spectrum cuts yield compatible results .",

    ", we report an excess of 1155 events with a statistical significance of 21.8 standard deviations , @xmath25 , from the direction of 1es  1218 + 304 during the 2008 - 2009 campaign ( 2808 signal events , 4959 background events with a normalization of 0.33 ) . figure  [ spectrum_fig ] shows the corresponding time - averaged differential energy spectrum .",
    "the spectrum extends from 200 gev to 1.8 tev and is well described ( @xmath26dof = 8.2/7 ) by a power law ,    @xmath27    the errors bars are statistical only .",

    "the average integral photon flux above 200 gev is @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath07% of the crab nebula flux above the same threshold .",

    "the inset within figure  [ lcspring_fig ] shows the light curve above 200 gev for nights with the highest flux .",
    "a fit of a constant to the emission during the entire season yields a @xmath26dof of 106/21 ( figure  [ lcspring_fig ] , dashed dotted line ) , corresponding to a very small @xmath29 probability ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the data taken during the active period in january / february of 2009 indicate variability on a time - scale of days .    in order to investigate possible changes to the spectral shape during the flaring activity",
    ", the total data set is divided into high - state and low - state samples .",
    "the two nights with the highest flux during flaring activity ( january 30 and 31 ) are considered the high state , while the remaining nights are considered the low state . both the high - state and low - state spectra are well described by a power law , and table  [ states_tb2 ] summarizes the spectral results .",
    "we do not see any evidence for a change in the spectral index during the increase in the absolute flux level from 1es  1218 + 304 .",
    "a prominent feature in the emission properties of blazars is the observed variability on time scales ranging from minutes to years . in 2006 , _ suzaku _ detected a prominent x - ray flare from 1es  1218 + 304 revealing a hard - lag variation in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "while 1es  1218 + 304 was flagged as variable in the _ fermi _ bright source catalog @xcite , no variability was detected in the _ fermi _ light curve @xcite .",
    "the increased flux measured by veritas is the first significant observation of flaring activity in the vhe emission from 1es  1218 + 304 . among the other hard - spectrum vhe blazars ( 1es 1101232 , 1es 0347121 , 1es 0229 + 200 , 1es1218 + 304 , rgb j0710 + 591 ) measured to date , 1es  1218 + 304",
    "is the first clear example of significant vhe variation from a baseline flux .",
    "consequently , the strong flare will challenge existing spectral models of 1es  1218 + 304 that assume a constant vhe emission from the source ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "it is generally assumed that the vhe emission from blazars is produced in the relativistic jet where the highly collimated and doppler - boosted emission is responsible for the high luminosities and short variability timescales .",
    "the size of the emission region , @xmath31 is constrained by the causality argument to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the relativistic doppler factor and @xmath34 is the observed @xmath3-ray variability timescale .",
    "an estimate of the flux - doubling time ( @xmath35 day , see figure  [ lcspring_fig ] ) limits the size of the emission region to @xmath36 .",
    "the doppler factor ( @xmath37 ) typically derived for blazars @xcite implies that @xmath38 .",
    "while the hard emission spectrum during the quiet state is consistent with the cmb - inverse - compton interpretation , the requirement for a large emission region ( @xmath39pc  scale ) predicted by the model is excluded by the @xmath38 constraint imposed by the variability .",
    "therefore , the flaring behavior from 1es  1218 + 304 implies that the cmb - inverse - compton model of emission in the kiloparsec - scale extended jet is unlikely to be the sole explanation for the extreme hardness in the intrinsic spectrum of 1es  1218 + 304 .",
    "although our observations of 1es  1218 + 304 are consistent with a baseline level of vhe emission that could have its origin in an extended emission region , the variability described here indicates that comparable flux with a comparably hard spectrum is emitted from the compact regions of this source .",
    "further observations of 1es  1218 + 304 are required to determine if the hard - spectrum emission can be explained as originating from the kiloparsec extended jet via the cmb - inverse - compton model .",
    "consequently , long - term vhe monitoring with ground - based @xmath3-ray telescopes may be crucial to unraveling the emission mechanism in distant the hard - spectrum vhe blazars .",
