    "stars form in a diverse range of environments within molecular clouds .",
    "these cloud environments include crowded , massive clusters heated by o stars ( e.g. in orion ) , smaller clusters without high mass stars ( e.g. in ophiuchus ) , or isolated , cold dark clouds containing low mass stars ( e.g. in taurus ) .",
    "the temperatures , densities , and turbulent linewidths of the natal molecular gas can vary systematically between these regions @xcite , and the surface density of young stellar objects ( ysos ) can vary by over two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to study how these different environments affect the outcomes of the star formation process .    despite significant differences in gas temperature , column density , and the turbulent velocities , the star forming regions and clusters in our galaxy exhibit remarkably similar initial mass functions .",
    "there may be a few exceptions : @xcite have compared the imfs from taurus with chamaeleon  i and ic-348 and find that taurus has a significant excess of stars between 0.6 and 0.8 m@xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , the similarity between the imfs of dark clouds like chamaeleon  i , clusters with b - stars such as ic  348 , and massive clusters with o and b stars such as the orion nebula cluster suggests that the imf is remarkably invariant .",
    "although the imf averaged over a star forming region or cluster may be universal , there is some evidence that masses are initially segregated within clouds or within clusters .",
    "massive stars are found primarily in the center of clusters , although it not clear whether this is the result of primordial mass segregation or dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "the detection of compact groups of massive protostars in the centers of clusters is evidence for primordial mass segregation since such objects would have little time for dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "mass segregation is also observed in small groups of young stars : @xcite studied groups of 20 and 40 stars in the taurus and perseus molecular clouds and found that the most massive members ( in some cases with a mass of only 1 m@xmath2 ) are found preferentially near the centers of the groups . in such small groups ,",
    "it is unlikely that dynamical evolution has occurred since the relaxation time of the group exceeds 5 myr , longer than the estimated ages of the groups @xcite .",
    "these observations are evidence for primordial mass segregation , with the imf in the centers of clusters biased towards higher mass stars .",
    "an understanding of the origin of the imf , and the potential primordial mass segregation within star forming regions , requires a better knowledge of both the initial conditions leading to the formation of stars as well as the process by which the gas is subsequently accreted onto the star .",
    "work on the initial conditions has focused on the determining the mass function of dense molecular cores that collapse into stars ( hereafter : core mass function or cmf ) .",
    "the similarity in the shapes of the imf and cmf has led to the suggestion that the imf reflects the cmf at later stages if a fixed percentage of the core mass is accreted onto the central protostar .",
    "although this provides an attractive model for a universal imf , there are several questions regarding this model .",
    "first , completeness and signal - to - noise issues may contribute to the observed shape of the cmf @xcite .",
    "second , it is unclear whether many of the observed star - less cores are gravitationally bound and capable of forming stars @xcite . third , the most massive cores are observed to form groups of stars , not single stars , and consequently , the high mass end of the cmf may describe a mass function for small stellar groups and not individual stars @xcite .",
    "fourth , the collapse of the core may be followed by the infall of gas from the surrounding molecular cloud resulting in a final stellar mass greater than that of the initial core @xcite .",
    "finally , it is known that young stars have stellar outflows and winds that mediate the infall of gas onto the central system and the accretion of gas onto the central protostar , thus the final mass must be in part determined by protostellar evolution @xcite . like the imf , a number of investigations have found that the cmf is also remarkably invariant in star forming clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these studies may not be able to detect variations in the cmf due to the limited angular resolution of the observations and the relatively small number of detected cores .",
    "furthermore , it remains to be seen if the core masses are segregated within molecular clouds .",
    "the study presented in this paper is part of a larger effort to build a bridge between the initial conditions of star formation ( the cmf ) and the resulting ensemble properties of the nascent stars ( the imf ) .",
    "it is in the protostellar phase that the mass from the collapsing core is accreted onto a star ; thus , protostellar evolution must play a key role in determining the properties of a nascent star .",
    "our understanding of protostars is limited by the difficulty in measuring their basic properties .",
    "the radiation from the accreting protostar is reprocessed or scattered by a non - spherical infalling envelope and disk .",
    "consequently , observations spanning near- to far - ir wavelength coupled with radiative transfer codes are needed to constrain fundamental attributes such as the emitted protostar luminosity , the inner envelope density , and the geometry of the envelope and outflow cavities . for this reason ,",
    "current work has focused on the most readily measured property of a protostar : its observed luminosity . the determination of the protostellar luminosity function in the nearest clouds by the _ spitzer",
    "c2d legacy program has motivated several theoretical studies showing that the luminosity functions provide an important constraint on protostellar evolution @xcite .",
    "we present here an observational study of protostellar luminosity functions in nine nearby ( @xmath3 1 kpc ) molecular clouds : orion ( combining the orion a and b clouds ) , mon r2 , cep ob3 , taurus , and the _ c2d _ mapped regions of serpens , perseus , ophiuchus , lupus i , lupus iii , and lupus iv , and chamaeleon ii .",
    "this study is motivated by the availability of _ spitzer _",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5 surveys of each of these clouds . with",
    "spitzer _ , we are capable of identifying and classifying young stellar objects ( ysos ) and , specifically , protostars using mid - infrared photometry .",
    "the protostellar sed peaks longward of the j , h , and k@xmath6 bands , making it imperative to utilize the longer wavelength photometry to identify and characterize protostars @xcite .",
    "we utilize photometry from the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0  @xmath1 m bands from the infrared array camera ( _ irac _ ) and the 24  @xmath1 m band on the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( _ mips _ ) instruments aboard _ spitzer _",
    "these wavelengths are highly sensitive to the infrared excess exhibited by ysos , with the excess even more pronounced at wavelengths longer than 24  @xmath1 m . after using the mid - ir colors to identify protostars",
    ", we use the slope of the sed and the mid - ir luminosity to estimate the bolometric luminosity of the member protostars and construct luminosity functions for each of the clouds .",
    "we then estimate the amount of contamination in our protostar sample due to reddened class ii sources , edge - on disks , and galaxies .",
    "this study expands on previous work in several ways .",
    "the chosen sample of clouds spans a range of environments , from crowded clusters with massive stars to relatively isolated regions of star formation .",
    "we present the first protostellar luminosity functions constructed from the _ spitzer _ surveys of the orion , mon r2 and cep ob3 clouds , each of which is forming massive stars .",
    "we then compare luminosity functions to test whether the luminosity function is universal , or whether it shows distinct differences between clouds as first suggested in a comparison of the taurus and ophiuchus clouds by @xcite .",
    "we also look for spatial variations in the luminosity function within individual clouds by comparing regions of high and low stellar density .",
    "finally , we compare our luminosity function with recent models of protostellar accretion .",
    "variations in the protostellar luminosity function are of key interest , since they may trace how differences in the environment affect the star formation process .",
    "the luminosity of a protostar is the sum of the intrinsic luminosity of the central protostar and the accretion luminosity generated by matter falling onto the protostar .",
    "the accretion luminosity is proportional to the mass accretion rate , and the mass accretion rate is dependent on the rate of mass infall from the envelope ( although the accretion rate may not equal the infall rate due to episodic accretion ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass infall rate , in turn , can depend on the properties of the surrounding gas and the physical mechanism driving infall .",
    "for example , if the mass infall results from the collapse of thermally supported cores , the infall rate increases with increasing sound speed , and hence , increasing temperature @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the infall is the result of bondi - hoyle accretion from a larger reservoir of gas , the infall rate increases with gas density and stellar mass @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if interactions between protostars are important , the luminosity may depend on the degree of clustering .",
    "thus , variations in the luminosity function can be used to understand the physics that mediates infall and accretion .",
    "furthermore , variations in the luminosity function may give us some insight into mass segregation .",
    "higher protostellar luminosities may imply either higher accretion rates - which can result in higher masses , or higher intrinsic luminosities - which may imply more massive protostars .",
    "although the relationship between the current luminosity and the ultimate mass is uncertain for protostars , they have the advantage of being at their birth sites .",
    "in contrast , stars used to determine imfs have typically dispersed their birth environment and have moved form their birthsites ( i.e. orion , ic 348 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , protostars provide the means to more directly connect the properties of a forming star and the environment in which it forms .    in section 2",
    ", we overview the data reduction and photometry .",
    "the identification of protostars and the determination of their bolometric luminosities is described in section 3 . after estimating the contamination in section 4 , the protostellar luminosity functions are presented and analyzed in section 5 .",
    "there we present evidence that the protostellar luminosity functions vary not only between molecular clouds , but also within clouds .",
    "section 6 compares our luminosity functions with predicted luminosity functions from a variety of accretion models and speculates on the implication of a spatially varying luminosity function for primordial mass segregation .",
    "the photometry of the clouds in our sample was assembled from multiple sources , as described in this section .",
    "in addition to using existing source catalogs from the _ c2d _",
    "program , the taurus legacy molecular cloud survey , and guaranteed time observations of taurus , we extracted photometry from _ spitzer _",
    "surveys of the orion , cep ob3 , and mon r2 clouds using psf fitting photometry techniques .",
    "for these three clouds , we applied a new approach for identifying saturated stars and measuring their 24  @xmath1 m magnitudes .",
    "we also identified saturated stars in the _ c2d _ clouds that are not in the existing catalogs and measured their photometry .",
    "finally , we used iras 25  @xmath1 m photometry to estimate 24  @xmath1 m photometry for highly saturated protostars in the taurus cloud .",
    "we list the irac and mips photometry for the protostar candidates , identified using the criteria described in section [ sec : criteria ] , in table [ table : table1 ] .",
    "aperture photometry of the irac data ( program ids ( pid ) 43 , 50 , 30641 , 50070 ) in orion were taken from megeath et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "the irac aperture photometry from cep ob3 and mon r2 ( pid 20403 ) were taken from gutermuth et al .",
    "( in prep ) with no modification .",
    "mips data for orion ( pid 43 , 47 , 58 , 30641 , 50070 ) , and cep ob3 and mon r2 ( pid 20403 ) were reduced , calibrated and mosaicked using the mips instrument team s data analysis tool @xcite .",
    "an additional mips field in the cep ob3 cloud containing an extension of the cep ob3b cluster ( pid 40147 ) was reduced using cluster grinder @xcite .",
    "point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry was used for the mips 24 @xmath1 m sources in each of these regions due the lower angular resolution in the wavelength band , the resulting confusion with other sources , and also nebulosity present at this wavelength .",
    "the psf fitting photometry was performed directly on the 24 @xmath1 m data mosaic .",
    "the steps of the psf extraction are described below .",
    "first , _ mips _",
    "24  @xmath1 m sources were identified using the source finding routine in photvis @xcite .",
    "the photometry was then extracted by photvis using an aperture size of 5 pixels and sky annulus between 12 and 15 pixels , with each pixel having a size of 1.\"25 .",
    "point - like sources were automatically selected by photvis , but careful visual inspection of the images added a few sources per image , mostly in nebulous regions .",
    "a zero - point magnitude of 16.48 was adopted ; this included the aperture correction from 5 pixels to infinity of 1.69975 .",
    "the images were in units of dn / s .",
    "the sources were detected in photvis above a 6 @xmath7 threshold , then each image was carefully inspected for missing sources .",
    "next , we created two psfs using a sample of bright but not saturated stars ; these were selected to be relatively isolated and in regions with little nebulosity .",
    "typically 15 sources were used for a given mosaic , but in a subset of mosaics there were fewer than 15 suitable sources available .",
    "we used two psfs ; one which would be used to extract photometry from the unsaturated sources and one used for the saturated sources , the latter of which was larger in order to encompass the extended psf wings of the saturated sources .",
    "the larger psf used for saturated sources has a radius of 35 pixels and a fitting radius of 10 pixels , while the psf used on unsaturated sources has a radius of 25 pixels and fitting radius of 2 pixels .",
    "we then fit the appropriate psf to the sources using the idl implementation of _ nstar _ from the idl astronomy library @xcite . to minimize the effect of crowding on the photometry",
    ", the sources were first grouped together in clusters of potentially overlapping source psfs using the routine _ group_. this routine groups together sources which were within 8 pixels of one of the other group members ; the sources in the group were then fit simultaneously using _",
    "nstar_. sources which contained pixels with signals greater than the saturation limit were flagged .",
    "to fit the saturated sources , we modified _",
    "nstar _ to ignore saturated pixels , which were flagged by a `` nan '' value in the image .",
    "unsaturated sources were fit with the smaller psf while saturated stars were fit with the psf with the larger size and fitting radius to ensure there were enough unsaturated pixels to provide a robust fit .",
    "any unsaturated sources which were grouped together with saturated sources were then treated like saturated sources for psf fitting and fit using the larger psf .",
    "we then used _ nstar _ to extract fluxes by first extracting fluxes for grouped unsaturated sources and then for grouped saturated sources .",
    "afterward , the psfs were scaled by the photometry and subtracted out with the _ substar _ routine ; this process was done twice , once first for the unsaturated and once for the saturated sources .",
    "the residual image was then inspected for sources which had not been extracted .",
    "these sources , typically one or fewer for each of the mosaics , were added into the photometry .",
    "the process of grouping , fitting , and extraction was iterated until we found no more new sources .",
    "very saturated sources ( those with many saturated pixels and for which photvis had difficulty estimating fluxes ) may not be easily fit by _ nstar_. these sources were then given estimated magnitudes and run through _ nstar _ using these estimations .",
    "after flux extraction , a residual image was created by _ substar _ , and",
    "visually inspected for poorly subtracted psfs .",
    "saturated sources were typically over - subtracted and were apparent in the residual image .",
    "the input magnitudes initially from photvis aperture photometry or from our initial estimation were adjusted until the residual in the image was minimized .",
    "photometric uncertainties for these sources are due to the varied environments of these sources , including areas of crowding or nebulosity , and were then found by determining the change in magnitude needed to create a noticeable over- or under - subtracted residual .",
    "this constrains the source magnitude to within typically @xmath80.25  @xmath9 .",
    "we fit 6 protostar candidates in orion in this way .",
    "for some sources , positions needed to be adjusted after _",
    "fitting as well , which was done so that the center of the psf fell directly over the center of the source . since",
    "a formal least - square fit and uncertainty could not be obtained , we use the results of this `` fit by eye '' for these sources . three protostar candidates in orion",
    "were given positions in this way .",
    "the process of grouping , fitting , and extraction was iterated while we found more new sources .    since each _ mips _",
    "frame is the subtraction of readouts from the beginning and end of the integration , some very saturated pixels had values below our adopted threshold for saturation .",
    "these saturated pixels can be identified by comparing the original image with a  fake \" image .",
    "we built the  fake \" image by first creating an image of the background nebulosity with the stellar sources subtracted .",
    "this was done by first running _ substar _ and smoothing the resulting image to minimize the artifacts from the subtraction , including the reduction of  holes \" in the image due to the over - subtraction of saturated sources .",
    "the subtracted stars were then added back to the smoothed image using one of our two psfs scaled to the best fit photometry . where the resulting simulated data exceeded the saturation limit we masked out pixels .",
    "the entire photometric extraction process was then repeated with the newly identified saturated pixels masked .",
    "this process was repeated until no new saturated pixels were found .",
    "the uncertainties listed in table [ table : table1 ] are the relative uncertainties of the data taken into account the photon noise and variations of the signal in the sky annulus .",
    "the 24  @xmath1 m uncertainties are those returned by the nstar program . for the highly saturated stars that are",
    " fit by eye \" , the uncertainties are given by the change in the magnitude to create a noticeable change in the residual and are noted in table [ table : table1 ] .",
    "the reported uncertainties do not include absolute uncertainties due to calibration errors ; these uncertainties are 5% for the irac and mips instruments .",
    "photometry for serpens , perseus , ophiuchus , chamaeleon , and lupus were obtained from the cores to disks ( _ c2d _ ) spitzer legacy project 4@xmath10 high - reliability data release .",
    "we used only the fluxes that were not band - filled , thus requiring that the source was detected in a specific band before adopting the tabulate photometry .",
    "these sources were identified in the _ c2d _ photometry tables as having an entry of ` -2 ' in the `` image type '' column in the high reliability catalog .",
    "in addition to the high - reliability catalog , we inspected the 24  @xmath1 m images of these clouds to search for sources that were not included in the _ c2d _ catalog due to saturation .",
    "for this purpose , we used the 24  @xmath1 m image of serpens from @xcite and _ c2d _ imagesfor the perseus , ophiuchus , lupus , and chamaeleon ii clouds . by comparing source list positions with the images",
    ", we identified sources which do not appear in the _",
    "c2d _ catalog and appeared saturated in the images .",
    "we then attempted to fit these sources using the psf technique described in section [ sec : saturation ] .",
    "we were successful in obtaining 24  @xmath1 m fluxes for 9 saturated sources across all of the _ c2d _ clouds using the modified version of _",
    "nstar_. we used a sample of unsaturated sources from the ophiuchus cloud to compare our photometry extraction method with that of the _ c2d _ survey .",
    "we found in a comparison of 72 sources , the mean difference in @xmath11 which we extracted and @xmath11 from the _ c2d _ data release is 0.0061 @xmath9 with a standard deviation of 0.12 @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , we compared our extracted serpens @xmath11 with that from the _ c2d _ data release , and found the median difference among 168 sources to be 0.051 @xmath9 with a standard deviation of 0.13 @xmath9 .",
    "these differences are well below the uncertainties in the flux calibration and the uncertainties in the measurements .    the positions and 24  @xmath1 m photometry for the saturated sources are listed along with the rest of the photometry in table [ table : table1 ] .",
    "also in table [ table : table1 ] are the uncertainties listed for the 2mass , irac , and unsaturated mips sources are adopted from the _ c2d _ catalog .",

    "@xcite find that this model reproduces a realistic imf between 0.1 and 10 m@xmath2 .",
    "the model luminosity function shows a peak near 1 l@xmath2 , akin to the luminosity functions from our sample of clouds which form high mass stars .",
    "myers ( in prep ) compare the resulting luminosity function with our orion protostellar luminosity function and find good agreement .    in conclusion ,",
    "the shape of the luminosity functions of our high mass and low mass sf clouds are best matched by those produced by the competitive accretion luminosity function of @xcite .",
    "we note that there are still significant differences between this luminosity function and the observed luminosity functions .",
    "we will further discuss the implications of this in section [ sec : wrapup ] .      of particular interest",
    "is whether the different luminosity functions imply a difference in the distribution of mass of the emerging stars forming in high and low stellar density regions .",
    "this would be a form of primordial mass segregation , with potentially more massive stars forming preferentially in denser regions .",
    "we stress again that the bolometric luminosities we estimate are the sum of the intrinsic luminosity of the protostar and the accretion luminosity resulting from gas falling onto the protostar . in low mass protostars ,",
    "the accretion luminosity probably dominates , but for higher mass objects the intrinsic luminosity becomes increasingly important @xcite .",
    "we make no attempt to estimate the contribution of each of these luminosity sources , and thus , it is not clear whether the most luminous protostars are those with the highest intrinsic luminosity or whether they have the highest accretion rates",
    ". if they are sources with a higher intrinsic luminosity , then these sources probably are higher in mass , particularly if they follow a stellar birthline @xcite . in the case that the luminosity is dominated by accretion , then a higher luminosity might imply a higher protostellar mass or a higher accretion rate @xcite . this might also imply a higher outcome mass for the protostar ; however , if the accretion rate is higher and the accretion time is shorter , then sources in clusters may exhibit higher luminosities but have the same outcome imf .",
    "thus , although one interpretation of the different luminosities is that the high stellar density regions contain protostars that are more massive or that will form stars of higher mass , this is not a unique interpretation .    if we are indeed seeing primordial mass segregation , then this would suggest that the presence of massive stars in the dense center of clusters is due to the environment found in these crowded regions , and not the statistical sampling of a constant imf @xcite .",
    "the competitive accretion model predicts a correlation between the density of stars in a cluster and the mass of the most massive member @xcite .",
    "this correlation is due to the large mass of gas drawn in by the gravity of the entire cluster of stars and accreted onto the most massive members of the cluster .",
    "the result is a higher mass accretion rate for the protostars in dense , clustered environments , particularly the most massive stars .",
    "although we observe variations in the luminosity function with stellar density , this may in effect be a dependence between the luminosity function and the gas column density .",
    "@xcite presented observational evidence for a schmidt - like star formation law in molecular clouds where the star formation rate per unit surface area is proportional to the gas density , squared . in this case",
    ", the stellar density may be just tracing the overall column density of the natal gas .",
    "consequentially the potential dependence of the imf on stellar density may in fact be a dependence of the imf on gas column density .",
    "a dependence between stellar density and gas density is predicted by the competitive accretion model , but could also result from jeans fragmentation in sheet - like clouds @xcite . however , although jeans fragmentation might explain the increasing stellar density with increasing gas density , it can not explain the increasing stellar mass with increasing gas and stellar density since the jeans mass decreases with increasing gas density .",
    "an increasing mass accretion rate with increasing gas column density is predicted by turbulent core models , but it is not clear whether such models could also explain the higher stellar densities in the vicinity of higher mass stars @xcite .",
    "thus , the competitive model is attractive in that it can explain the observed protostellar luminosity functions and their dependence on stellar density .",
    "based on the observational study presented in this paper , we can draw the following conclusions : that the peak of the luminosity function of clouds forming high mass stars is near 1 l@xmath2 while for the clouds not forming high mass stars the luminosity functions show a broad plateau that peaks below 1 l@xmath2 , that the luminosity functions of the high and low mass sf clouds are different , and finally , that the luminosity functions drawn from low and high density regions in orion are different .",
    "our comparison of with the current models available in the literature show that none of the available models provide an excellent match to the observed luminosity functions .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "the offner & mckee models do not take into account details of protostellar evolution such as the clearing of the envelope and the possibility of some degree of episodic accretion .",
    "on the other hand , the @xcite model only considers models staring with the collapse of a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "we expect that these results , as well as future luminosity functions derived from herschel data , will drive the development of realistic models of protostellar models .    within the available models ,",
    "the competitive accretion model provides the best match .",
    "it best reproduces the shape of the low mass sf cloud and high mass sf cloud luminosity functions .",
    "we note that this model works well since it invokes an accretion rate that is dependent on both the instantaneous and final mass of the star ; this is different than models of isothermal sphere collapse where the infall rate is constant and depends only on the sound speed in the gas @xcite .",
    "the different luminosity functions in the high and low mass sf clouds can be approximately reproduced with luminosity functions of an ensemble of protostars forming a @xcite imf truncated at upper mass limits of 3 m@xmath2 and 10 m@xmath2 for the high and low mass sf clouds , respectively ( note that we have excluded the regions of high mass star formation from our study of high mass star forming clouds due to saturation ) . furthermore , the variations of the protostellar luminosity function with the spatial density of ysos is also a prediction of the competitive accretion model , where the most massive stars are formed preferentially in the centers of dense clusters of stars @xcite .",
    "for these two reasons , we currently favor the competitive accretion model .",
    "the protostellar luminosity function , however , does not provide a definitive test for models of protostellar evolution ; these models must be tested on other grounds as well , such as the measured velocities of the protostars and the density of the surrounding gas @xcite and the distribution of sources in a bolometric luminosity and temperature diagram @xcite .",
    "only though comprehensive observations examining in detail the many facets of protostars and their environments , can we both test models of protostars and drive the refinement of those models to incorporate all the essential elements of protostellar evolution .",
    "we identify 727 protostar candidates in _ spitzer",
    "_ surveys of nine star forming clouds within 1 kpc of the sun .",
    "the sample includes both nearby dark clouds forming primarily low mass stars , clouds with moderate sized clusters forming intermediate mass stars , and clouds with large clusters forming massive stars .",

    ", we have done the following analysis :    * we estimate bolometric luminosities based on sed 3 - 24 @xmath1 m slope ( @xmath15 ) and the 1 - 24 @xmath1 m luminosity , @xmath16 .",
    "we do this by determining a relationship between @xmath17 and log(@xmath15 ) using _",
    "sources with known bolometric luminosities , then applying the relationship to all protostars in our sample and estimating bolometric luminosities for each of our protostar candidates .",
    "* we estimate the amount of contamination from reddened class iis , edge - on disks , and background galaxies .",
    "we find that up to 20@xmath18 of our protostar candidate sample are likely edge - on disks , 4@xmath18 are likely reddened class ii objects , and 2@xmath18 are likely galaxies . these contaminating objects are removed from our sample using a statistical approach . * the resulting protostellar luminosity functions for clouds that for high mass stars ( orion , cep ob , and mon r2 ) peak near 1  l@xmath2 .",
    "the luminosity functions of each high mass sf cloud has a tail extending toward luminosities upward of 100  l@xmath2 . * the protostellar luminosity function of the low mass sf clouds ( those without high mass stars )",
    "do not show a common peak .",
    "the combined taurus / lupus / chamaeleon luminosity function shows a marginal peak near 1  l@xmath2 , the ophiuchus luminosity function shows a marginal peak below 1  l@xmath2 , serpens shows a broad peak near 2.6  l@xmath2 , and perseus do not show a well - defined peak .",
    "none of the low mass sf clouds contain protostars at luminosities above 1000  l@xmath2 nor do they show a tail above 100 l@xmath2 .",
    "* we find significant differences between the combined low mass sf cloud luminosity function and the combined high mass sf cloud luminosity function .",
    "the median probability that they are from the same parent distribution is @xmath14 = -4.66 .",
    "thus , we do not expect the luminosity function of protostars in high mass sf clouds are from the same parent distribution as the luminosity function of protostars in low mass sf clouds .",
    "* in the orion clouds , there is a very low probability that the protostellar luminosity functions from high and low stellar density regions are drawn from the same parent distribution ; instead the luminosity function becomes increasingly biased to higher luminosities with increasing stellar density .",
    "this may be evidence for primordial mass segregation , although there are other possible explanations .",
    "a similar tend is seen in mon r2 , but the trend is weak or non - existent in cep ob3 and not present in the low mass star forming clouds .",
    "* we compare our luminosity functions with models of protostellar accretion .",
    "we do not find a good match between the model luminosity function incorporating episodic accretion of @xcite and our low mass sf cloud luminosity function .",
    "the combined luminosity function of both the high mass and low mass sf clouds are best matched by the competitive accretion model as implemented by @xcite , although other models can not be formally ruled out .",
    "competitive accretion also predicts a dependence of the accretion rate with stellar density , consistent with the variations of the luminosity function with environment we find in our high mass sf clouds .",
    "we conclude that models like competitive accretion which predict mass accretion rates that vary with both the mass of the protostar and the density of stars and gas in the surrounding environment , are best able to describe our observations .",
    "the completeness of the protostar catalog is important to assess .",
    "our search for protostars in the _ spitzer _ cloud surveys is not limited by sensitivity , but by the @xmath11 cutoff applied to minimize contamination from extragalactic sources .",
    "figure 2 shows that we detect faint sources 2 magnitudes or more fainter than our @xmath11 cutoff .",
    "furthermore , at the cutoff , the number of 24  @xmath1 m sources is increasing with increasing magnitude .",
    "for these reasons , we believe our sample to be complete in most of the surveyed molecular clouds ; however , because of the presence of bright nebulosity , subregions of each cloud may be affected by incompleteness .",
    "regions with very bright nebulosity , such as the orion nebula or ngc  2024 , are typically saturated in the _ mips _",
    "24  @xmath1 m image ; these saturated regions are ignored in this paper s analysis .",
    "however , regions with signal levels well below saturation can be incomplete due to the confusion with the spatially varying nebulosity .",
    "furthermore , regions with high stellar density can be systematically less complete due to the crowding and brighter nebulosity in clusters ( megeath et al . in prep ) .    to the assess the impact on the analysis in this paper , we concentrate on the orion molecular clouds .",
    "orion contains the most luminous and nebulous star forming regions of our cloud sample .",
    "perhaps more importantly , orion is the one cloud in which the luminosity functions in high and low stellar density regions are statistically different .",
    "thus , we need to ascertain whether the difference between regions of high and low stellar density is real or is because of spatially varying completeness .",
    "megeath et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "measure the completeness using artificial star tests in the orion data .",
    "they find that the completeness at a given magnitude varies with position depending on the amount of bright , saturated nebulosity .",
    "they parameterize the amount of nebulosity using the root median square deviation , rmedsq = @xmath19 , which is calculated in an annulus around each source .",
    "the rmedsq gives a measure of the spatially varying signal from neighboring stars and structured nebulosity surrounding each source ; in the _ spitzer _ bands the variations are dominated by the bright mid - ir nebulosity . using the fraction of synthetic 24  @xmath1 m point sources recovered as a function of rmedsq .",
    "( megeath et al in prep . ) , we have estimated the completeness surrounding each of the protostar candidates . the adopted rmedsq value is the mean value for all the ysos within the clustering length of @xmath20 = 0.19 pc .",
    "we then find the fraction of sources detected with magnitudes equal to the cutoff magnitudes .",
    "the results of this analysis is shown in figure 18 .",
    "for both high and low stellar density regions in orion .",
    "for the combined high and low stellar density regions , 55% of orion protostars are in regions where the fraction of stars recovered is @xmath21 0.90 ; nevertheless , both the regions of high and low stellar density have regions where the fraction of recovered sources at @xmath11 = 7 drops to close to 0",
    ". we can reduce the incompleteness by reducing the cutoff magnitude . in figure 18",
    ", we show the same analysis for @xmath11 = 6 .",
    "we find that using the @xmath11 = 6 cutoff , 73% are found in regions where @xmath21 0.90 sources are recovered .",
