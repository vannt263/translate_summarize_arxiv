    "the interaction of elementary excitations with defects is an old problem of solid state physics . for the case of optical phonons , it has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of the raman scattering applications for determination of the isotopic composition @xcite , for detection of stacking faults in polytypes @xcite , for investigations of residual strain and strain relaxation at interfaces in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "a refinement of these effects takes the interactions among phonons and with defects into account .",
    "\\(i ) _ the phonon decay _ into two ( or more ) acoustic or optical phonons is possible even at zero temperature .",
    "these unharmonic processes give rise to the so - called natural width @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the optical - phonon frequency , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron and atom masses . in spite of the small value @xmath4 ,",
    "the decay processes give the observable linewidth in raman spectra and the quite small mean - free path @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lattice constant .",
    "the decay cross section depends weakly on the phonon frequency since no singularities exist in the final density of states for that processes .",
    "therefore , the natural optical - phonon width @xmath7 can be considered for given material as constant up to room temperatures and for the phonon frequency varying in a small interval of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "then we obtain for perfect crystals the lorentzian line shape of raman spectra .",
    "\\(ii ) _ the phonon interaction with defects _ should be considered in two aspects .",
    "first , it gives rise to elastic phonon scattering and makes an additional contribution to the phonon width @xmath8 .",
    "this contribution ( linear in defect concentration @xmath9 ) can be evaluated @xcite using the golden rule of quantum mechanics . the scattering by defects , being elastic , conserves singularities of the phonon density of states .",
    "this is important for the raman scattering , because we are interested in phonons with small wave vectors . for the short - range potential of defects with the radius of the order of @xmath10 ,",
    "the singularity arises also in the width @xmath8 as function of phonon frequency @xmath11 at the phonon branch edge , i.e. , at the maximum ( or minimum ) value @xmath1 .",
    "thus we obtain the asymmetrical raman line shape , that was observed in experiments with 3@xmath12-sic @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is sensitive to the defect geometry , which may have the point , line or plain form @xcite .",
    "secondly , the interaction with defects can result in appearance of new modes .",
    "for instance , the mode forbidden by selection rules in perfect crystals at given experimental conditions has been observed in crystals with the stacking faults which give an example of plain defects in sic polytypes @xcite .",
    "some additional modes were found also in computer simulations for the sequence of number layers with the stacking faults @xcite . in addition , the localized mode can be associated with defects @xcite .",
    "the problem of localized states on the single isotopic defect has the exact solution .",
    "however , the case of the low , but finite defect concentration involves serious difficulties @xcite .",
    "that is because the solution should be self - consistent for the large distances essential near the edge of phonon branches .",
    "if the natural width is ignored , the answer obtained in the series expansion of the phonon self - energy is the following . the edge of phonon branches is displaced linearly in @xmath9 and the band of localized states arises with a width of the order of @xmath13 . this @xmath13 behavior is explained by fluctuations in the spatial distribution of defects .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to consider ( taking the natural width into account ) the situation when the states localized on defects can exist .",
    "we are especially interested in the case when the localized states appear near an edge of optical - phonon branches .",
    "broadening of localized states is found just in the lowest order in the defect concentration @xmath9 , if this additional width is larger than the natural phonon width .",
    "this unusual behavior is conditioned by the resonance interaction of localized states with the close edge of the extended phonon branch .",
    "the defects of different geometries are treated such as point defects , line defects involved by dislocations , and plain defects produced by stacking faults or by the crystallite boundaries .",
    "they give the different broadening and asymmetry of the raman line shape .",
    "the preliminary results of the work were published in ref .",
    "we solve the equation for the phonon green s function in the form : @xmath14 where the interaction with defects located in points @xmath15 is @xmath16    for an isotopic defect , @xmath17 is constant : @xmath18 , where @xmath3 and @xmath19 are the masses of the defect atom and the host atom , respectively , @xmath6 is the lattice constant . in the following ,",
    "the large distances from the defect on the atomic scale are important .",
    "then for any type of defects , we can set the fourier component @xmath17 equal to the constant @xmath20 supposing the short - range potential .",
    "for the same reason we expand the phonon spectrum near the brillouin - zone center taking the green s function in the absence of defects as @xmath21 where the natural phonon width @xmath7 is connected to decay into acoustic or optical phonons .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath22 gives the differential density of squared frequencies .",
    "in addition , the raman intensity @xmath23 for phonon excitation with frequency @xmath11 and momentum @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath25 which gives the lorentzian line shape in the absence of defects @xmath26 if @xmath7 is assumed to be small in comparison to the frequency @xmath1 .    in the presence of defects , the green s function must be averaged over defect positions . it is convenient to use the well - known diagram technique for impurities scattering @xcite .",
    "this method can be modified @xcite in order to take the possible localized states into account . performing the iterations of eq .",
    "( [ gfe ] ) in @xmath27 and averaging over the defect positions , we have for the sum of noncrossing diagrams : @xmath28 which gives after some algebra @xmath29    the term of first order only in the defect concentration @xmath9 is held in the phonon self - energy given by the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) , since we assume that the distance between defects ( @xmath30 for line defects ) is larger , than the phonon mean - free path @xmath31 .",
    "let us emphasize that the phonon self - energy involves the perturbed function @xmath32 , but not @xmath33 .",
    "then the green s function @xmath32 has to be found from the integral equation ( [ def ] ) .",
    "integration ( summation ) is perfomed with respect to the 3d - vector @xmath34 for point defects , over the 2d - vector @xmath35 for line defects ( then @xmath36 ) , and over @xmath37 for plain defects ( then @xmath38 ) .",
    "the integral equation ( [ def ] ) can be reduced to an algebraic equation .",
    "we introduce the new unknown function @xmath39 and the complex variable @xmath40 in the case of point defects by the definition @xmath41 then eq . ( [ def ] ) gives @xmath42 in the case of line defects @xmath43 and we obtain @xmath44 for plain defects @xmath45 we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the dimensionless coupling constant proportional to @xmath20 , @xmath9 is the atomic concentration of defects in 3d , 2d , or 1d region , respectively for the point , line , or plain defects , @xmath48 is the cutoff frequency , the @xmath49 axis is taken in direction of the line defect or normal to the plane defect , @xmath50 is parallel to the plane defect .",
    "the branches of @xmath51 and @xmath52 have to be taken in the upper half - plane .",
    "we consider the retarded green s function which has no singularities in the upper half - plane of complex variable @xmath11 .",
    "the equations ( [ sol1])([sol3 ] ) have two singularities .",
    "one at @xmath53 is related to the branch edge of the extended optical - phonon mode .",
    "other at @xmath54 is related to the localized mode and determined by the zero of expressions in parentheses of eqs .",

    "the second solution @xmath39 ( dashed lines indicated by the arrows 2 ) corresponding to the same @xmath40 should be rejected since it has singularities in the upper half - plain . for real @xmath40 ,",

    "however , for the finite value of @xmath7 , the coupling constant should be strong to give the substantial gap : @xmath65 . this condition can be rewritten as @xmath66 , if we introduce the radius of localized states @xmath67 and the phonon mean - free path @xmath68 .",

    "the cases of the positive coupling constant , when the localized states arise , are shown in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "the accurate results ( solid lines ) differ considerably from that obtained in the unrenormalized approximation ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the maximum that was found in the unrenormalized approximation is smoothed out , transforming into a shoulder with the width of the order of @xmath105 in accord with eq .",

    "to summarize , we investigate here the structure of the phonon density of states and the raman line shape in the situation when localized levels @xmath71 interact strongly with the closely - spaced edge of the extended optical - phonon states . in the linear approximation in defect concentration @xmath9 , the contribution of localized states does not have the well - known form of @xmath106-function : @xmath107 , if the effect of defect concentration is more essential than the phonon natural width .",
    "the line shape of bulk - phonon extended states is asymmetrical .",
    "the additional width ( proportional to the defect concentration ) arises on the side of line related to the band of extended states . as a most intriguing example",
    ", we would like to compare the behavior of the raman lines of graphite at 1600 @xmath94 and of diamond - like material at 1300 @xmath94 .",
    "when defects are added to graphite , the low - frequency wing of the line becomes to drop more slowly than the high - frequency wing ( see figs . 1 and 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in just the same way as shown in figs . 2 and 3 of the present paper .",

    "@xcite and fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using the present theory ,",
    "the explanation of the phenomenon may be attributed to the difference in the phonon dispersion of these substances .",
