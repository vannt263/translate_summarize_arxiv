    "electro- and photoproduction of neutral pions near threshold have been a topic of many experimental and theoretical investigations over the past decade .",
    "triggered by surprising results obtained at saclay  @xcite , the mainz  @xcite and saskatoon  @xcite groups established that a formerly believed low - energy theorem ( let )  @xcite for s - wave photoproduction was at variance with nature . while the let predicted a threshold s - wave multipole @xmath1 , the experiment yielded @xmath2 .",
    "the discrepancy between the theorem and the experimental data was finally explained by bernard _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who showed that loop corrections provided nonanalytical terms in the pion mass @xmath3 .",
    "the flaw of the low - energy theorem was therefore the assumption that the amplitudes would be an analytical function in the pion mass @xmath3 , which could be expanded in a taylor series in the soft - pion limit . in the following years",
    ", these calculations were considerably refined by evaluating the s - wave amplitude @xmath4 to order @xmath5 in the chiral expansion , and the 3 p - wave amplitudes ( @xmath6 ) up to order @xmath7 .",
    "while there appear 3 low - energy constants to that order , two combinations of p - wave amplitudes were found to be independent of these constants .",
    "further work has extended this approach to virtual photons  @xcite    using a different approach , a recent calculation obtained a good description of @xmath8 photo- and electroproduction in the threshold region within a meson - exchange dynamical model  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the largest contributions to the final - state interaction came from one - loop charge - exchange rescattering .",
    "this approach lead to a to good description of the @xmath9-wave multipoles .",
    "the large reduction of the s - wave threshold amplitude was independently obtained using fixed-@xmath10 dispersion relations  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the born terms have to be evaluated at the nucleon pole where the pseudovector and the pseudoscalar pion - nucleon coupling are identical . while the result of the old let was essentially equivalent to the result of pseudovector coupling at threshold , the value of the multipole at the pole position corresponds to pseudoscalar coupling . as a result the born term to be used in dispersion theory is @xmath11 , and thus the dispersion integrals over the excited states have to cancel about 80  % of the pole term in order to describe the data .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coupled - integral equations were solved using the method of omns and mushkashevili  @xcite . on the condition that the complex phases of the multipoles are known and with given assumptions for their high - energy behavior , this method allows one to find unique solutions .",
    "in practice , however , the phases are known only in the energy region below the two - pion threshold due to the watson theorem  @xcite .",
    "extending these calculations to energies above the second resonance region , which coincides with the onset of two - pion production , requires modeling the phases by functions which depend on the pion - nucleon phase shifts and inelasticity parameters .",
    "the ansatz for the functional dependence is based on unitarity but by no means unique , and in principle has to be determined by a fit to the data .",
    "it is therefore the aim of the present work to extend the energy range of the dispersion analysis by use of the unitary isobar model  @xcite ( called maid in the following ) as an input for the imaginary parts of the multipole amplitudes . at the same time , we want to compare the results obtained by use of maid with those with the said multipoles  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to present a qualitative `` error band '' for the dispersion analysis , which often has been asked for .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly recall the ingredients of dispersion relations at fixed @xmath10 .",
    "the actual calculations are described in section iii . in particular , we extend the energy range of the maid model by including the contributions from all @xmath12 and @xmath13wave resonances with four - star pdg status . as a particularly sensitive test of the extended model , we present predictions of our calculation for threshold production of neutral pions in section iv .",
    "in the present work , we will use fixed-@xmath10 dispersion relations ( dr ) to construct the pion electroproduction multipoles ( or partial waves ) @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the set of quantum numbers , @xmath18 is the total c.m .",
    "energy of the @xmath19 system , and @xmath20 is the four - momentum squared of the virtual photon with three - momentum @xmath21 and energy @xmath22 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ dr1 ] ) , @xmath23 , comprises the explicitly known contributions from the pole diagrams with pseudoscalar @xmath24 coupling .",
    "the second and third terms are the principal value and regular parts of the dispersion integrals which contain the kernels @xmath25 and the imaginary parts of the multipoles .",
    "both integrals run only over the physical region starting at threshold @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath3 are the nucleon and pion masses , respectively .",
    "the detailed expressions for the kernels and the numerical recipes for their numerical computation are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in accordance with this work",
    ", the relations between the multipoles @xmath28 and the standard cgln  @xcite multipoles @xmath29 are the following : @xmath30 with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the nucleon c.m .",
    "energy in the initial ( final ) state , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the absolute values of the c.m .",
    "pion and photon momenta , respectively , and @xmath35 the pion orbital momentum .",
    "while the fixed-@xmath10 dr in the form of eq .",
    "( [ dr1 ] ) are uniquely defined , the separation into the principal value and regular integral contributions is not unique and depends on the choice of the kinematical factors in eq .",
    "( [ mult ] ) .",
    "other kinematical factors , i.e. , as used in refs .",
    "@xcite , will change the relative contributions of these two integrals and the expressions for the kernels .",
    "for example , if we introduce a new set of multipoles via the relation @xmath36 with a certain factor @xmath37 , we find the following relation between the new and old kernels : @xmath38 the different expressions for the kernels given in the literature can be easily checked and compared by use of these relations .",
    "for example , we found that at @xmath39 , the kernels from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite lead to the same result .    for future analysis , it is convenient to rewrite the dr of eq .",
    "( [ dr1 ] ) in terms of the cgln multipoles @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 the kinematical factor @xmath43 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ mult ] ) with the relation @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "one of the advantages of such a representation is that each term in eq .",
    "( [ dr2a ] ) is individually independent of the choice for the kinematical factor @xmath46 .",
    "this statement can be easily proved by use of eq .",
    "( [ kern ] ) .",
    "one of the methods widely used to calculate the dispersion integrals in eq .",
    "( [ dr1 ] ) or eqs .",
    "( [ dr2a])-([dr2b ] ) is based on the watson theorem  @xcite , stating that the phase of pion photo- and electroproduction is equal to the phase shift of pion - nucleon scattering , @xmath47 , below the two - pion threshold . below this threshold",
    ", we can therefore use the following relation between the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude : @xmath48 if we further make an assumption about the high - energy behavior of the multipole phases , we obtain a system of coupled integral equations for @xmath49 .",
    "this is the standard method to apply fixed-@xmath10 dispersion relations to pion photoproduction at threshold and in the @xmath50 resonance region , which was successfully used by many authors  @xcite .",
    "the reliability of this method at low energies ( @xmath51 mev ) is mainly based on the finding that eq .",
    "( [ watson ] ) can be applied to the important @xmath52 multipole , dominated by the @xmath50 resonance contribution , with good accuracy up to @xmath53 mev .",
    "another method to calculate the dispersion integrals is based on isobaric models  @xcite which allow extending the use of fixed-@xmath10 dr to higher energies . with this approach ,",
    "the imaginary parts of the pion photo- and electroproduction multipoles are expressed in terms of background ( @xmath54 ) and resonance ( @xmath55 ) contributions , @xmath56 in the present work , both parts will be modeled similar to the recently developed unitary isobar model  @xcite maid .",
    "the imaginary parts from the background appear due to final - state interaction effects for the pions produced by nonresonant mechanisms and contain contributions from both the born terms ( @xmath57 ) with an energy - dependent mixing of pseudovector - pseudoscalar ( pv - ps ) @xmath24 coupling and t - channel vector - meson exchanges ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59\\,(1+it^{\\alpha}_{\\pi n}(w))\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the pion - nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath60 $ ] is given in terms of the @xmath19 phase shifts @xmath61 and the inelasticity parameters @xmath62 , taken from the analysis of the said group@xcite . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite the background contribution depends on 5 parameters : the pv - ps mixing parameter @xmath63 in @xmath64(see eq .",
    "( 12 ) of ref.@xcite ) and 4 coupling constants in @xmath65 .",
    "note that in our present work , we do not include hadronic form factors at the @xmath66 and @xmath67 vertices .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite the resonance contributions are given in terms of breit - wigner amplitudes , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the usual breit - wigner factor describing the decay of a resonance @xmath70 with total width @xmath71 and physical mass @xmath72 .",
    "the main parameters in the resonance contributions are the strengths of the electromagnetic transitions described by the reduced amplitudes @xmath73 , which have to be extracted from the analysis of the experimental data . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the previously developed maid model by including contributions from all @xmath74 and @xmath75-wave resonances with four - star pdg status  @xcite .",
    "the addition of new resonances requires performing a new fit . for this purpose",
    ", we use the said data base  @xcite for pion photoproduction in the energy range @xmath76  mev with 15,700 data points .",
    "the resonance parameters and values of @xmath77 at the resonance position obtained from the best fit are listed in table  1 .",
    "we note that in most cases the background contributions to the imaginary parts are less then 10% at the resonance positions .",
    "the only exceptions are the channels with the @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 resonances , for which we find @xmath81 2.50 , 0.85 and -1.45 , respectively , in comparison to @xmath82 -1.28 , 2.45 and 0.52 . here and in the following , all multipoles are quoted in units of @xmath83 . in the case of the overlapping resonances in the @xmath84 proton channel , we find @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where the first and second terms are the contributions from the first and second @xmath84 resonance , respectively , and the last terms come from the background contributions .    alternatively , we calculate the dispersion integrals using the solution sm02 of the said multipole analysis  @xcite ( see table 1 ) . concerning the integration up to infinity , we assume that the multipoles have an asymptotic behavior like @xmath87 for @xmath88  mev .",
    "this is the minimal power providing convergence for the gdh sum rules  @xcite . in the threshold region",
    ", we introduce the pion mass difference by assuming that the imaginary part of the @xmath89 multipoles is proportional to the @xmath90 momentum below @xmath91  mev .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that near threshold the main contribution to the imaginary part comes from the coupling with the @xmath92 channel  @xcite .",
    "the threshold region has traditionally posed a problem to the analysis of @xmath8 photoproduction within a dispersion - relation approach  @xcite . this is due mainly to considerable cancellations in the dispersion integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ dr2a ] ) and ( [ dr2b ] ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , by solving the integral equations using the watson theorem , the real part of the @xmath93 threshold multipole obtains surprisingly large contributions from the imaginary parts of higher multipoles which peak at much larger energies . as a result",
    ", the high - energy region provides sufficiently large contributions to nearly cancel the nucleon pole term with pseudoscalar @xmath24 coupling , thus leading to agreement with the experimental threshold values .",
    "similar results are obtained in our present work using fixed-@xmath10 dr and imaginary parts of the multipoles taken from the maid model and from the results of the said multipole analysis , @xmath94 @xmath95 where the contributions on the right - hand side are presented , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ dr2a ] ) , in the following order : the pole term , the diagonal @xmath89 , the kernel terms @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and the combined kernel contributions of the higher @xmath99- and @xmath75-wave multipoles . according to eq .",
    "( [ dr2b ] ) , the diagonal @xmath89 contribution can be further divided into the principal - value integral and the regular integral , which contribute @xmath100 using maid and @xmath101 using said solutions . as discussed above",
    ", this sum does not depend on the choice for the kinematical factor @xmath43 .",
    "the individual contributions from the coupling to the @xmath99- and @xmath75- wave multipoles are presented in table 2 . taken separately ,",
    "they are not negligible , but in the sum they nearly cancel and lead to a total value very close to the extracted value of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath102 .",
    "1 compares the energy dependence of the @xmath89 amplitude , obtained , on the one hand , directly from the maid and said solutions ( dash - dotted curves ) and , on the other hand , using of the dispersion relations , eq .",
    "( [ dr1 ] ) , with @xmath77 as input taken from the maid and said solutions ( solid curves ) .",
    "we clearly see the wigner cusp effect appearing in the dr solutions due to the infinite derivative of @xmath103 ( dashed curves ) at the charged pion threshold . in the maid solution ( dash - dotted curve ) , the cusp effect is the result of the strong coupling to the @xmath90 channel taken into account by the k - matrix approximation  @xcite .",
    "the said solution does not include this effect .",
    "finally , table  3 summarizes our results for the threshold @xmath9- and @xmath104-wave multipoles and compares them to the results of the recent experimental analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath104-wave multipoles we list the values of the following linear combinations , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in general , the dr results are consistent with the corresponding maid or said solutions and in good agreement with the results of chpt and the experimental values of ref .",
    "a large discrepancy remains for the @xmath107 amplitude , where the theoretical predictions with and without the use of dr are considerably smaller than the experimental value .",
    "this may hint at problems in the description of the @xmath97 multipole which appears more pronounced in @xmath107 than in @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "dispersion relations for pion electroproduction are more involved due to the more complicated structure of the kernels @xmath110 . in addition , the transverse multipoles of the virtual photons are also coupled with the longitudinal ones via the kernels .",
    "moreover , we have very limited information about the longitudinal ( coulomb ) resonance excitations at finite @xmath0 . in the following",
    ", we present first calculations for threshold @xmath8 electroproduction using dispersion relations with the dispersion integrals determined by the maid model .",
    "the longitudinal excitation of the @xmath50 and @xmath111 resonances are described as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the other resonances we assume the validity of the pseudothreshold relation  @xcite @xmath112 .",
    "these assumptions lead to the following threshold values for the @xmath9-wave multipoles at @xmath113 ( gev / c)@xmath114 : @xmath115 @xmath116 the terms on the right - hand side correspond , in that order , to the contributions of the pole term , the diagonal term , the coupling to the @xmath96 , and the coupling to the higher multipoles . as in the case of real photons",
    ", we find that the largest contributions come from the diagonal term and the @xmath96 multipole , which nearly cancel the large contribution of the pole term .    the threshold behavior of the @xmath89 and @xmath117 multipoles at @xmath113 ( gev / c)@xmath114 is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we point out the much smaller cusp effect in the @xmath117 , compared to the @xmath89 multipole , due to the smaller imaginary part of the @xmath117 .",
    "the fixed-@xmath10 dr results are in a good agreement with the results of the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the real parts of the @xmath89 and @xmath117 multipoles obtained from the maid solution , are closer to the results of refs .",
    "however , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the extracted results for the @xmath9 waves at finite @xmath0 strongly depend on the assumptions used for the @xmath104-wave contributions .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath89 multipole . for example , at @xmath113 ( gev / c)@xmath114 the differences in the @xmath104 waves used by various groups lead to quite different threshold values for the @xmath89 , namely @xmath118  @xcite , @xmath119  @xcite , and @xmath120  @xcite . clearly , these differences in the analysis techniques must be resolved before a comparison with theoretical predictions can be meaningful .",
    "note that we find significant dispersion corrections for both multipoles at finite @xmath0 .    fig .",
    "3 shows the @xmath0 dependence for several @xmath9-wave multipoles and @xmath104-wave multipole combinations and compares our results with the results of the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite . a number of interesting features emerge . in general , the dr results for the transverse multipoles are consistent with the corresponding maid solution . for the @xmath117 multipole , and the longitudinal p - wave combinations @xmath121 and @xmath122 , strong dispersion corrections appear at low @xmath0 .",
    "our dispersion results are in agreement with the results from chpt below @xmath123 in the case of the @xmath89 multipole and the @xmath108 combination but differ significantly for the @xmath117 multipole , and the @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 amplitudes .",
    "this may reflect the fact that some of the chpt low - energy constants where fitted to electroproduction threshold data while the maid solutions are constrained by data in the resonance sector . just as in fig.2",
    ", the experimental points shown have to be understood in the context of model - dependent analyses techniques",
    ".    finally , we present in fig . 4 predictions for the quantity @xmath127 which determines the sign of the beam asymmetry , i.e. @xmath128 .",
    "recent measurements  @xcite yielded a negative value for the @xmath129 at @xmath39 and @xmath130 mev , in rough agreement with chpt results . however , both the maid and the dr results are positive at the photon point and become more positive for higher photon virtualities .",
    "in contrast , the chpt results remain negative .",
    "clearly , a measurement of this observable at finite @xmath0 is highly desirable .",
    "threshold pion photo- and electroproduction have been calculated with fixed - t dispersion relations . unlike previous work for photoproduction following the method of omnes and mushkashevili",
    ", we have used the imaginary parts of the multipoles of the unitary isobar model maid and the phenomenological partial - wave analysis said as input to calculate dispersion integrals .",
    "unitarity , crossing symmetry , lorentz invariance and gauge invariance are all fulfilled by the dispersion relations . especially crossing symmetry",
    "can only be partially fulfilled in model calculations , even field - theoretical lagrangians violate crossing symmetry when energy - dependent widths for nucleon resonances are introduced . rather than fitting to threshold data , by using the dispersion relations we employ models that are fitted to data in the resonance region , where more data is available .",
    "for pion photoproduction we obtain very good agreement with the threshold multipoles obtained from experimental analyses .",
    "both the cusp effect and pion - loop effects are well described and the differences between the maid and said inputs play only a minor role .",
    "in fact , it rather reveals the systematic uncertainty in such a dispersion approach .",
    "we also find good agreement with the results of chpt for for s- and p- waves , except for the quantity @xmath131 .",
    "this discrepancy was already observed in the previous dispersion analysis of hanstein et al.@xcite and relates to a very delicate cancellation among two large p - wave amplitudes .",
    "the situation for pion electroproduction reflects much uncertainty , both in theory and experiment .",
    "much less data is available which leads to model dependencies in the extraction of the multipoles at finite @xmath0 .",
    "since the electroproduction coincidence cross section can not be completely separated , a model independent analysis as in the photoproduction case is not yet possible , making any comparison with theory difficult .",
    "we emphasize that our dispersion theoretical calculation has the advantage that most of the input for the fixed - t dispersion relation comes from the magnetic excitation of the @xmath132 resonance which is very well known even for pion electroproduction .",
    "future experiments will hopefully remove the model dependencies in the extraction of the multipole amplitudes and allow an unambiguous comparison with the predictions from dispersion relations .",
