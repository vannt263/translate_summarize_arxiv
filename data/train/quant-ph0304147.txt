    "in recent years , the ballistic transport through quantum systems has been studied as a scattering problem on billiards ( microwave cavities ) with infinitely high potential walls ( hard wall approximation ) .",
    "the scattering properties of such billiards are closely related to the spectral properties of the corresponding closed billiards @xcite . the opening of the billiards is realized by attaching at least one lead to them . however , for the study of the transmission through the billiard two leads are necessary . the fundamental object that characterizes the process of quantum scattering is the unitary s - matrix relating the amplitudes of incoming waves to the amplitudes of outgoing waves .",
    "provided that the properties of the hamiltonian @xmath0 for the closed billiard are known , one can consider its open counterpart and work out the s - matrix formalism by standard methods of the theory of quantum scattering @xcite . as a result",
    ", the s - matrix is expressed in terms of both the hamiltonian @xmath0 and the matrix elements describing the coupling of the billiard states to the lead states .",
    "the explicit expressions for the coupling matrix elements were formulated at first in 1996 by eba et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of point contacts of the leads with the billiard .",
    "later , fyodorov and sommers @xcite developed their theory for the connection of the billiard with one lead of finite width by using neumann boundary conditions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recently dittes @xcite considered the same type of an open system and derived the expressions for the coupling matrix with neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions both by using the green function technique .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider a d - dimensional billiard connected to leads by using another approach that is based on the tight - binding model .",
    "the motivation for this consideration is the following .",
    "first of all , the increasing development of fabrication techniques requires the possibility to perform reliable numerous experiments on ballistic transport through devices of atomic size @xcite and through molecular devices consisting of very few atoms .",
    "secondly , pichugin _ et al _ @xcite who applied the formula for the coupling matrix derived by dittes @xcite , found that their results do not coincide with those of a direct numerical computation of the s - matrix poles , above all for the dirichlet boundary conditions . as we will show in the present paper ,",
    "one of the reasons for this disagreement is that the formal continuum approach used by dittes @xcite is unbounded in energy and gives zero radiation shifts . in electron transmission through electron wires , however , the energy of the electrons is bounded in energy , at least from below .",
    "this fact gives rise to radiation shifts of poles of the s - matrix which can not be neglected in calculations for concrete systems .",
    "thirdly , it is desirable to receive numerical results from an s - matrix computation within the tight - binding model in order to compare them with the results of numerical computation of the transmission through billiards . to this aim",
    "we derive , in the present paper , the coupling matrix , the effective hamiltonian and the poles of the s - matrix within the tight - binding model and present some typical numerical results .    here , the following remark should be added .",
    "the computer simulations solve the schrdinger equation using finite - difference hamiltonians , i.e. the tight - binding approximation .",
    "after matching the incoming and outgoing waves with the solutions of the schrdinger equation by implying the boundary conditions at the transverse sections of the leads , the conductance of the billiard as well as the scattering wave function can be computed .",
    "today , the calculations can be performed with a very high accuracy by using large grids and the technique of sparse matrices .",
    "the current s - matrix theory is adequate to these computer simulations .",
    "it is , however , numerically more time consuming because the effective hamiltonian is not a sparse matrix .",
    "nonetheless , calculations with the effective hamiltonian are useful since they provide another view to the results . in this formalism , the resonant peaks of the conductance are related to the poles of the s - matrix that correspond to the eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "it is possible therefore to draw some conclusions on the origin of the resonant peaks and on their possible control by means of external parameters .    in the present paper",
    "we will follow , as closely as possible , the dittes review @xcite , even in the notations . in the case of microwave or quantum semiconductor billiards ,",
    "the waves are incident to the billiard through ( infinitely ) long straight waveguides ( leads ) of a certain width .",
    "the different channels correspond therefore to different transverse modes of the wave propagation within the leads @xcite . at a given frequency @xmath1 ( the fermi energy )",
    ", we enumerate the propagating modes by @xmath2 .",
    "thereby , we associate with the lead region a continuous set of states @xmath3 where @xmath4 specifies the lead number ( terminal ) . in the present paper",
    ", we consider mostly two leads , the right lead with incident and reflected waves and the left lead with outgoing waves as shown in fig .",
    "our approach can , however , be easily generalized to a larger number of leads as done in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "a numerical scheme for the computation of quantum transport through billiards with attached leads is mainly based on the finite - difference schrdinger equation . implying the ando procedure @xcite for the boundary conditions has enabled us to find the transmission properties of the billiards from the scattering wave function for any geometry of billiards and straight leads . in order to compare the results from such a computation with the s - matrix theory , we consider systems projected on a lattice with finite grid .    as a first example",
    ", we consider a simple one - dimensional model for quantum scattering and transport .",
    "this model is formulated as the tight - binding model ( the anderson model ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 if @xmath7 , @xmath8 if @xmath9 , and @xmath10 otherwise .",
    "this tight - binding model presents the simplest case of a one - dimensional box with @xmath11 sites coupled with left and right semi infinite leads via the corresponding coupling constants @xmath12 . for a schematic representation see fig .",

    "points and , correspondingly , @xmath11 resonant states . ]    the hopping matrix elements @xmath13 in the hamiltonian ( [ tight ] ) are proportional to overlapping integrals of electron wave functions between adjacent atoms .",
    "the model being similar to the one - dimensional model with a double barrier structure @xcite , describes resonant tunneling . in this case",
    ", the values of the coupling coefficients @xmath14 play the role of the heights of the double barrier structure provided that @xmath15 .",
    "the present model gives , however , also the possibility to consider the case of strong coupling , @xmath16 . at the left of the box we present the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the reflection coefficient with energy @xmath20 as will be seen later",

    "[ fig2 ] .    ) are shown by stars .",
    "one can see the radiation shifts caused by the coupling of the 1d box with the leads . ]    the tight - binding model ( [ tight ] ) demonstrates a few remarkable features .",
    "the first one is the symmetry of the resonant transmission relative to @xmath35 .",
    "this symmetry means the following : for small as well as for large coupling coefficients , the effective coupling of the box to the leads is small .",
    "such a feature was firstly observed in reactions on atomic nuclei , see the review @xcite , and analytically derived by dittes _",
    "et al _ for an @xmath11-level system coupled to one open channel @xcite . with increasing coupling strength ,",
    "the widths of @xmath36 resonance states decrease as @xmath37 in the single - channel case while only one resonance state accumulates almost the total sum of the widths . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath11-level system is coupled to two open channels .",
    "correspondingly , with increasing coupling coefficients @xmath38 the widths of @xmath39 resonance states decrease while the widths of two resonance states increase .",
    "we will return to this feature below when the poles of the scattering matrix will be considered .",
    "the second feature is that the heights of the resonant peaks are equal to one only when @xmath40 , similar to the double barrier resonant structure . this fact was firstly established by ricco and azbel @xcite .",
    "the radiation shifts of the positions of the resonant peaks relative to the eigenvalues of the box @xmath41 are the third peculiarity of the tight - binding model .",
    "the positions of the eigenvalues ( [ eigen1d ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by stars .",
    "the shifts and widths of the resonant peaks are symmetrical relative to @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the last symmetry follows from the invariance of the solution of the tight - binding model relative to @xmath44 .",
    "the simplicity of the model ( [ tight ] ) allows us to establish the explicit correspondence between the analytical results for the transmission amplitudes ( [ rt ] ) and the s - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "this 1d model was also used in @xcite to investigate the width distribution . in this approach",
    "the scattering system is decomposed into a closed subsystem described by the internal hamiltonian @xmath0 with discrete bound states @xmath45 and the continuum of external scattering states @xmath46 and @xmath47 corresponding to the semi infinite left and right leads .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two uncoupled subsystems is @xmath48 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are the energies of the bound states of the 1d closed billiard , and @xmath1 denotes the energy of the leads .",
    "we use the following normalization conditions @xmath50    the couplings between the internal and external subsystems can be incorporated by the coupling operator @xmath51    as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] the closed 1d billiard consists of @xmath11 sites with energies given by eq .",
    "( [ eigen1d ] ) and the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath52 these eigenfunctions satisfy the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath53 . since the leads are semi - infinite wires the wave functions of the left and right lead are respectively @xmath54 the energy in the leads corresponding to a single conductance energy band , is defined by @xmath55 .",

    "the reason for this difference is that the energy is restricted to the conductance band @xmath91 .",
