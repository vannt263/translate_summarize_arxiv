    "these different `` positive parts '' correspond to different positive structures on @xmath26 , one the product the standard positive structures on the flag variety , and one descending from the standard positive structure on @xmath1 .",

    "this naturally identified with the flag variety of the corresponding root subgroup , isomorphic to @xmath341 .",

    "the other hand @xmath343 is precisely @xmath344 . by our calculation for @xmath341 ,",
    "these sets do not coincide .    by analogy with previous positivity results @xcite",
    ", we conjecture that the varieties @xmath39 and the parameterizations of them we have described are closely connected to the positive part of @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath333 has a real cell decomposition , given by its intersections with the subvarieties @xmath39 where @xmath40 range over @xmath10 .",
    "each such intersection @xmath345 is contained in @xmath346 , and @xmath347 gives an isomorphism between @xmath348 and @xmath349 .    the positive structure on @xmath1 can be strengthened to a cluster algebra structure ( for background on cluster algebras , see @xcite ) , so the varieties @xmath350 have a natural cluster algebra structure .",
    "[ q : clusters ] does @xmath223 have a cluster algebra structure for @xmath351 ?",
    "while quite natural from the perspective that the varieties @xmath223 are a generalization of double bruhat cells , this question appears to be quite difficult , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this section , we show how our partition ( and that of deodhar ) are compatible with the natural poisson structure induced by the standard poisson structure on @xmath1 and the double structure on @xmath30 .",
    "we assume from now on that @xmath1 and @xmath30 are endowed with these poisson structures , unless stated otherwise .",
    "* one from the product of the poisson structure induced on @xmath16 by the standard poisson group structure on @xmath1 ( `` the product structure '' ) .",
    "* one induced by the double poisson structure on @xmath30 ( `` the double structure '' ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this correlation would be a positive answer to question  [ q : clusters ] . a cluster algebra structure on the varieties",
    "@xmath39 would endow them with compatible poisson and positive structures .",
    "in fact , there are many different poisson structures on @xmath26 , in particular , one for each pair of transverse lagrangian subalgebras @xmath352 and @xmath353 of @xmath354 . for more on such subalgebras ,",
    "see the papers of evens and lu , @xcite . it is proved in @xcite that the intersection of each @xmath355 and @xmath356 orbits is a regular poisson subvariety of @xmath32 , where @xmath355 and @xmath356 are the normalizers of @xmath357 and @xmath358 in @xmath28 .",
    "this provides the analog of the partition of @xmath32 in the general case .",
    "this implies that the standard poisson structure on @xmath1 and the double structure on @xmath30 can be pushed forward to well defined poisson structures on @xmath16 and @xmath26 . the latter become poisson homogeneous spaces for @xmath16 and @xmath26 , respectively , of so called group type .",
    "let @xmath21 be a poisson @xmath360-variety for any poisson algebraic group @xmath360 , and assume the poisson tensor vanishes at @xmath361 .",
    "then the map @xmath362 is poisson . in particular",
    ", @xmath363 is a poisson subvariety .",
    "since the poisson structure on @xmath26 is not the product of poisson structures on @xmath16 , the second half of the proposition does not follow immediately from the first , though it does have the same proof .",
    "similar techniques were used in ( * ? ? ? * proposition 1.6 ,  3.1 ) .",
    "we might hope that there is some sort of compatibility between the poisson structure of @xmath39 and our subvarieties @xmath223 .",
    "they can not be poisson since @xmath39 are the minimal @xmath75-invariant poisson subvarieties of @xmath26 .",
    "but there is a weaker notion of compatibility with poisson structures which it is more reasonable to expect .",
    "one calls a subscheme @xmath380 of an algebraic poisson variety @xmath21 * coisotropic * if its ideal sheaf @xmath381 is closed under poisson bracket .",
    "that is , if @xmath371 and @xmath130 are two rational functions on @xmath21 , which both vanish on @xmath380 , @xmath382 does as well .",
    "note that this is a much weaker condition than being a poisson subvariety , which requires @xmath382 to vanish on @xmath380 if either of @xmath371 or @xmath130 does .",
    "some care must be taken when applying this proposition to algebraic maps which are not reduced . in this case",
    ", one may pullback the reduced subscheme structure on a subset of @xmath21 , and obtain a non - reduced subscheme @xmath385 which is coisotropic , even though its reduced counterpart @xmath387 is not .",
    "this will not be a problem as long as the map @xmath388 is smooth ( in the algebraic sense , which is roughly equivalent to being a submersion in the differential category ) .",
    "we will first consider the case of @xmath394 . by proposition  [ prop : coisotropy ]",
    ", coisotropy is preserved under pullback by poisson maps .",
    "thus , consider the poisson map @xmath395 .",
    "each deodhar component of @xmath132 is the intersection of the pull - back of a deodhar component of @xmath396 or @xmath397 with @xmath398 ( here we use the fact that @xmath399 is smooth ( in the sense of algebraic geometry ) , to see that the subscheme structures match up ) . by induction , these are coisotropic subvarieties of @xmath400 , and so their pullbacks are coisotropic in @xmath401 , which is a poisson subvariety of @xmath16 .",
    "we complete this section with a proof of the fact that our partition is in fact a stratification .",
    "while the dimension calculations we have done suggest that this is the case , it needs to be carefully checked . in some other , superficially similar situations , e.g. certain moduli spaces of flat connections ,",
    "similar partitions are not stratifications .",
    "luckily , on @xmath26 , this is not the case .",
    "let @xmath403 be the sheaf of all algebraic vector fields on @xmath402 and let @xmath404 the subsheaf of vector fields such @xmath21 such that the pushforward @xmath405 is well defined and hamiltonian on @xmath406 . in particular , @xmath407 is simply the sheaf of hamiltonian vector fields .",
    "now let @xmath408 be the intersection of these sheaves .",
    "this sheaf is @xmath360 invariant , the maps @xmath409 and the poisson structure on each variety are @xmath360-invariant , so @xmath410\\subset \\mc g$ ] , and @xmath411 is a lie algebra subsheaf of @xmath403 .",
    "consider the orbits of @xmath412 on @xmath402 , that is , the foliation one obtains from integrating it .",
    "this is a partition of @xmath402 which respects the partition @xmath413 ( since these are torus orbits of symplectic leaves ) .",
    "we claim that these are precisely the subvarieties @xmath223 .",
    "since the varieties @xmath223 are connected , we need only check that the image of the evaluation map @xmath414 has image precisely @xmath415 .",
    "that the image is contained in this tangent space is clear , since @xmath416 lands in the tangent space to the symplectic leaf in each case , since all push forwards are hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "assume that the claim is true for @xmath417 .",
    "then if @xmath418 , @xmath419 is an isomorphism , and the hamiltonian vector fields @xmath420 for all functions @xmath371 on @xmath421 span the tangent space to @xmath223 .",
    "otherwise , there is a 1 dimensional kernel , which the hamiltonian vector fields of pullbacks form a complement to in @xmath415 .",
    "since evaluation by the poisson form @xmath422 vanishing on @xmath423 is an open condition , on some ( analytic ) neighborhood of @xmath322 , @xmath424 does not vanish on @xmath425 , and there is a 1-form @xmath426 such that @xmath427 .",
    "the hamiltonian vector field @xmath428 is in @xmath408 , since it is killed by @xmath429 for all @xmath417 .",
    "thus , we have proved that the subvarieties @xmath223 are precisely the leaves of the foliation corresponding to @xmath412 .",
    "since the closure @xmath430 is also invariant under @xmath412 , it is a union of leaves of the corresponding foliation , i.e. of varieties @xmath431 where @xmath432 ranges over some set of reduced double subexpressions of @xmath36 . since the varieties @xmath223 are smooth , connected and locally closed , this partition is , in fact , a stratification .    consider the poset structure on given by @xmath433 if and only if @xmath434 for all @xmath167 .",
