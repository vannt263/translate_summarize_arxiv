    "mass transfer is the signature feature of close binary evolution . in relatively wide binaries ,",
    "this mass transfer can occur via capture of some part of the stellar wind of the donor by the accretor , but in close systems , the dominant mode of mass transfer is by roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "hydrodynamic estimates of roche lobe overflow rates @xcite show that mass transfer rates are typically of order @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass of the donor star , @xmath2 the orbital period of the binary , @xmath3 the effective roche lobe radius , which is the radius of a sphere of the same volume as the interior of the roche lobe , @xmath4 the donor s radius @xmath5 minus its roche lobe radius @xmath3 , and @xmath6 the donor s effective polytropic index .",
    "this mass transfer rate is exquisitely sensitive to @xmath7 ; so long as mass transfer occurs on a time scale much longer than the dynamical time scale of the binary , @xmath8 .    we can examine the stability of mass transfer by comparing the responses of donor star radius and roche lobe radius to perturbations in the mass transfer rate .",
    "so long as @xmath9 , hydrostatic equilibrium prevails through the interior of the donor star , and dynamical terms become important only in the vicinity of the inner lagrangian point .",
    "variations in the radius of the donor can be separated into mass- and time - dependent parts : @xmath10 the first term on the right - hand side represents not only the evolutionary expansion ( or contraction ) of the donor star in the absence of mass transfer , but also the expansion or contraction due to thermal relaxation if , for example , mass transfer has driven the donor out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side represents the hydrostatic response of the radius to changing mass , with thermal or chemical diffusion and nuclear evolution suppressed ; that is , it represents the adiabatic response of the donor star to mass loss .",
    "we will henceforth label this logarithmic derivative by the subscript ` ad ' instead of @xmath11 , and define @xmath12 the roche lobe radius of the donor depends on three quantities ( assuming a circular orbit )  its mass @xmath1 , the total mass of the binary @xmath13 , and the orbital angular momentum of the binary @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the roche lobe radius in units of the binary separation , and is a function only of the binary mass ratio , or as written here , of the ratio of donor to total mass .",
    "we can thus write @xmath17 in conservative mass transfer , as that term is commonly used , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are conserved quantities , and therefore the latter two terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dlnrl_mmj ] ) vanish .",
    "however , more generally , a binary may suffer background mass loss through a stellar wind from the companion star , or angular momentum losses through , for example , stellar winds or gravitational wave radiation .",
    "moreover , systemic mass and angular momentum losses may contain contributions arising from a loss of part of the mass transfer stream between binary components ; we can call these consequential losses .",
    "we therefore decompose the terms in @xmath18 and @xmath19 into terms linearly independent of @xmath20 and given the subscript @xmath1 , and those consequential losses linearly proportional to @xmath20 and given subscript @xmath11 , by analogy with eq .",
    "( [ dlnr1 ] ) .",
    "we then write @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 by analogy with eq .",
    "( [ zetaad ] ) above , we define @xmath24 combining eqs .",
    "( [ dlnr1 ] ) and  ( [ dlnrl ] ) , we obtain @xmath25 { \\rm d}t + \\left ( \\zeta_{\\rm ad } - \\zeta_{\\rm l } \\right ) { \\rm d } \\ln m_1 \\ . \\label{dlndelr}\\ ] ]    now suppose that the donor star exactly fills its roche lobe .",
    "in order for mass transfer to occur , @xmath5 must increase faster ( or decrease slower ) than @xmath3 would if it were not for mass transfer ; that is , the coefficient of @xmath26 in eq .  ( [ dlndelr ] ) must be positive .",
    "if the mass transfer rate is self - limiting , the stellar radius will parallel the roche lobe radius as mass transfer proceeds , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "this condition then requires that the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dlndelr ] ) be negative . since @xmath28 , it follows that self - limiting ( stable ) mass transfer can only occur if @xmath29 . in that case",
    ", we can solve directly for the mass transfer rate : @xmath30 \\ . \\label{zetaad_zetalobe}\\ ] ] typically , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are of order unity , and mass transfer is driven on a time scale @xmath33 . if the donor remains in thermal equilibrium , mass transfer proceeds on a nuclear time scale .",
    "if , on the other hand , the donor has been driven out of thermal equilibrium by mass loss , it typically expands much more rapidly , on its thermal time scale , and accordingly mass transfer proceeds on that thermal time scale . in some circumstances , such as among the shorter - period cataclysmic variables or double - degenerate binaries",
    ", the driving time scale may be that characterizing contraction of the roche lobe by angular momentum losses .",
    "dynamical time scale mass transfer occurs if @xmath34 .",
    "both right - hand terms in eq .",
    "( [ dlndelr ] ) are then positive , and the donor star radius is then driven by simple hydrostatic relaxation far beyond its roche lobe radius . in this case , the mass transfer rate can in principle accelerate up to a truly dynamical rate ( cf .",
    "( [ mdot ] ) ) .",
    "three - dimensional simulations of this process @xcite show that the donor envelope is tidally disrupted , engulfing the companion star while tidal torques from the lagging , distorted envelope plunge that companion and the core of the donor into orbits deeply embedded in that envelope .",
    "the binary enters common envelope evolution @xcite .",
    "the common envelope itself lags in rotation behind the embedded cores , which spiral inward as they lose orbital energy and angular momentum to the envelope .",
    "ultimately , either the dissipation of orbital energy suffices to eject the common envelope , revealing the core of the original donor and its companion star , or the cores merge within the common envelope .",
    "examples of the products of common envelope evolution include planetary nebulae with close binary nuclei , cataclysmic variables , and other short - period binaries containing at least one degenerate component .",
    "it is important to recognize that common envelope evolution must be very rapid , lest radiative losses quench common envelope ejection , and that energy sources other than orbital energy dissipation are unlikely to contribute significantly to the energy budget of the system @xcite .",
    "adiabatic mass loss sequences can therefore define the energy difference between initial and final states .",
    "this energy difference must be supplied by orbital energy dissipation .",
    "useful insights into the behavior of donor stars under adiabatic mass loss can be gleaned from very simplified models .",
    "@xcite investigated the properties of polytropic models with power - law equations of state , including complete polytropes , composite polytropes ( @xmath35 cores with @xmath36 envelopes and @xmath37 equations of state ) , and condensed polytropes ( @xmath36 envelopes with point mass cores ) .",
    "these models are relevant for some main - sequence stars and giant - branch stars , and illuminate the qualitative ( and , within limits , quantitative ) behavior of those stars .",
    "they were further employed by @xcite to explore stability criteria for binary mass transfer .",
    "however , these models leave many important evolutionary stages of a donor unexplored , and they leave considerable room for improvement even where they may be applicable @xcite . a more sophisticated approach , using realistic stellar models , is both desirable and possible , as shown by @xcite .",
    "this paper represents a step toward filling this need .",
    "we describe here a method of construction of stellar adiabatic mass loss sequences . in a given sequence",
    ", the initial model corresponds to a full stellar model at an arbitrary state in its evolution .",
    "as in the pioneering work of @xcite , mass is removed from the surface while stellar interior at each point relaxes adiabatically to a new state of hydrostatic equilibrium . in section 2 , we describe the modifications to the normal set of stellar structure equations that are needed to construct adiabatic mass loss sequences ; how one can recover the internal luminosity profile , and hence thermal relaxation rate , from the adiabatic sequences ; and how we have implemented these concepts in a numerical code .",
    "adiabatic mass loss sequences constructed in this way yield @xmath31 , fixing the critical mass ratio for dynamical time scale mass transfer , but they also reveal thresholds for a delayed dynamical instability arising when the donor is stripped down to a nearly isentropic core .",
    "these applications are described in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss the calculation of the total energy of a donor star as it loses mass adiabatically , and the application of those results to determining in what orbit , if any , a binary can survive common envelope evolution .",
    "we conclude with a brief appraisal of the relevance of our results to population synthesis studies in section 5 .",
    "adiabatic mass loss models rest on two basic approximations : that in the limit of rapid mass loss , the response of the donor star is everywhere locally adiabatic ; and that hydrostatic equilibrium nevertheless prevails throughout the bulk of the interior of the donor star .",
    "the first of these approximations implies not only that heat flow can be ignored , but that ( under the schwarzschild criterion for convection ) convective boundaries are preserved with respect to mass . both the specific entropy profile and the composition profile of the donor interior",
    "are therefore fixed along an adiabatic mass loss sequence .",
    "the second approximation implies that fluid flow velocities are negligible ( highly subsonic ) through the interior of the donor .",
    "solutions for the outflow of gas from a lobe - filling star show that this assumption breaks down only in the vicinity of the inner lagrangian point ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to illustrate the strength and limitations of the adiabatic approximation , we show in fig .",
    "[ entropy - rlof ] the specific entropy profiles of the donor star at five epochs during mass transfer for a binary with initial mass @xmath38 = @xmath39 , initial mass ratio ( donor / accretor ) @xmath40 = @xmath41 , and initial orbital period @xmath42 = @xmath43 . as mass loss",
    "progresses from epoch @xmath44 to epoch @xmath45 , the mass transfer rate rises from about @xmath46 ( a thermal timescale ) to about @xmath47 ( a quasi - dynamical timescale ) .",
    "we see that the entropy profile of the donor remains nearly unchanged during mass transfer on quasi - dynamical time scales ( from curve @xmath48 to curve @xmath45 ) , but that even for the thermal timescale mass transfer , thermal relaxation is largely concentrated in the outermost layers , which are immediately stripped away .",
    "little heat transport occurs in the deep interior .",
    "this pattern of thermal relaxation typifies stars with radiative envelopes , with rising entropy driven by energy absorption in the outer envelope ( as opacity rises rapidly with decreasing temperature during decompression ) , accompanied by falling entropy in the deep interior ( as thermal energy generation supplants nuclear sources as they are frozen out by decompression ) . among stars with deep surface convection zones",
    ", the entire convective envelope slowly declines in specific entropy , as radiative energy losses from the surface exceed the input of energy at the base of the convection zone ( these being choked off by the local rise in opacity as the underlying radiative zone undergoes decompression ) .",
    "thus , the adiabatic approximation not only defines the asymptotic response of a donor star in the limit of faster - than - thermal time scale mass transfer , but serves as a good approximation to the deep interior response even during thermal time scale mass transfer .      in principle",
    ", we can draw the initial model for an adiabatic mass loss sequence from any point in the evolution of the donor star .",
    "following common practice in close binary evolutionary models , we neglect rotational and tidal effects on the structure of that star , and treat it as spherically symmetric .",
    "the initial model then satisfies the usual set of four first - order ordinary differential equations of stellar structure , where four structure variables , i.e. , pressure @xmath49 , radius @xmath50 , temperature @xmath51 and luminosity @xmath52 , vary with an independent variable , mass @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 here density @xmath59 , opacity @xmath60 , adiabatic temperature gradient @xmath61 , nuclear energy generation rate @xmath62 , neutrino loss rate @xmath63 , and specific heat at constant pressure @xmath64 are functions of @xmath49 , @xmath51 , and the abundances of various nuclear species @xmath65 .",

    "near the surface of an initial model , @xmath66 typically varies very rapidly with mass , while the mass increment from one mesh point to the next becomes a very small fraction of the stellar mass . because of the limitations of numerical accuracy ( we typically require that the _ average _ correction to structure variables in a model deemed ` converged ' not exceed one part in @xmath138 ) , the situation arises frequently that the nominal error in mass coordinate @xmath53 is comparable with ( or even exceeds ) the mass difference between one mesh point and the next . in this case , the nominal mass coordinates of mesh points near the surface may not be well - ordered , making the accurate interpolation in mass of the specific entropy and its gradient impossible .",

    "the mass loss rate from the donor has grown to roughly a thermal time scale rate . in fig .",
    "[ rtlrho_m ] we show comparisons of the interior density , luminosity , temperature , and radius profiles in the adiabatic models with those in the time - dependent calculation when both models have reached point ( @xmath45 ) of fig .",
    "[ entropy - rlof ] .",
    "only very minor differences appear in layers very close to the surface , but in general these two calculations are in excellent agreement , giving strong support to the use of adiabatic mass loss sequences to model rapid mass transfer .",
    "an important application of adiabatic mass loss sequences is the evaluation of threshold conditions for the onset of dynamical time scale mass transfer . as discussed in section  [ intro ] , this condition corresponds formally to @xmath34 ; in that case , a sufficiently rapid perturbation to the donor star ( i.e. , one faster than a thermal time scale ) can lead to unbridled growth of the donor radius beyond its roche lobe ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ dlndelr ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath29 the donor will transfer mass on a slower time scale , on a nuclear or angular momentum loss time scale if the donor thermal equilibrium radius - mass relation ( @xmath143 ) is sufficiently steep ( @xmath144 ) , or on a thermal time scale if thermal relaxation tends to drive the donor beyond its roche lobe ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "adiabatic responses of stars to mass loss depend strongly on the variation of specific entropy with mass in their outermost layers .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ newrmsm ] for lower main sequence stars . as one progresses down the main sequence , the surface convection zone grows deeper , and , as illustrated here , the initial contraction of stellar radius with decreasing mass becomes less and less severe . in the limit of fully convective stars ( @xmath146 in fig .",
    "[ newrmsm ] ) , their behavior approximates the @xmath147 dependence that follows from the homologous expansion of an isentropic gas sphere supported by classical ideal gas pressure . in contrast , stars on the upper main sequence , with nearly completely radiative envelopes , undergo very rapid contraction with adiabatic mass loss , since their high - entropy outer layers occupy a disproportionately large fraction of their stellar volume . broadly speaking , then , stars with convective envelopes tend toward dynamically unstable mass transfer , while those with radiative envelopes tend toward stability .",
    "the situation in reality is somewhat more complex . as is evident in fig .",
    "[ newrmsm ] , the radius - mass exponents @xmath31 , @xmath148 , and @xmath32 are not constant over the course of mass transfer , but vary continuously , in some cases very rapidly . this is true particularly of @xmath31 in the case of a star with a radiative envelope as it first fills its roche lobe .",
    "typically , the specific entropy rises extremely rapidly through the surface layers of such a star ( see fig .",
    "[ entropy - rlof ] ) , which therefore decrease rapidly in density .",
    "loss of even a small amount of mass leads to rapid reduction in the stellar radius , so @xmath31 is initially very large and positive .",
    "donor stars with radiative envelopes are therefore typically strongly stable against dynamical time scale mass transfer , at least initially .",
    "however , as mass loss proceeds , and the surface layers are stripped away , entropy gradients flatten , and the initially rapid stellar contraction moderates considerably . if the deep interior lacks strong entropy gradients ( a circumstance typically prevailing during core hydrogen burning ) , then as the donor star is stripped down to this region it may begin expanding with further mass loss , much as an ( isentropic ) convective star expands with decreasing mass . under these circumstances , the donor star may belatedly become unstable to _ delayed dynamical mass transfer_.      the adiabatic response of a @xmath149 terminal main sequence star , shown in fig .",
    "[ zeta_ad_3_2msun ] , illustrates the nature of this delayed dynamical instability .",
    "this star has a deep radiative envelope , and we see that in the adiabatic limit , its initial response is indeed extremely rapid contraction . recalling that even in thermal time scale mass transfer , little thermal relaxation occurs in the deep interior of a donor star ( see section  [ adiab ] , fig .",
    "[ entropy - rlof ] ) , we can regard the adiabatic mass loss sequence as approximating the _ minimum _ radius of the donor star as a function of its mass .",
    "we see that , in this example , a binary with an initial mass ratio @xmath150 , assumed to transfer mass conservatively , never reaches this minimum radius in the course of mass transfer ; in this case , the mass transfer rate need never exceed a thermal rate in order for the donor star to track its roche lobe through the mass transfer episode .",
    "in contrast , a binary with an initial mass ratio @xmath151 undergoes such rapid roche lobe contraction ( again in the conservative approximation ) that , despite the rapid initial adiabatic contraction of the donor , the roche lobe radius reaches the minimum radius set by the adiabatic mass loss sequence ( intersection of the dashed line with the solid line in fig .",
    "[ zeta_ad_3_2msun ] ) when the donor has been reduced to a fraction 0.86 of its initial mass . in this case , the system may transfer mass at a thermal rate up to that point , but the donor is then no longer able to remain within its roche lobe , and dynamical time scale mass transfer must ensue .",
    "this is the delayed dynamical instability . at an initial mass ratio @xmath152 ( dash - dotted curve ) , the roche lobe radius is tangent to the adiabatic mass - radius relation ( at @xmath153 ) , a condition which then marks the threshold for delayed dynamical instability , in the limit that the donor star response is truly adiabatic , and that mass transfer is conservative .",
    "since the delayed dynamical instability follows a period of slower , thermal time scale mass transfer , in which some measure of thermal relaxation inevitably occurs , the question arises , how good is the adiabatic approximation for the threshold of delayed dynamical instability ?",
    "we can glean at least a partial answer to this question by comparing the adiabatic results in the example above with a family of time - dependent mass transfer models spanning the same range of initial mass ratios , and again assuming conservative mass transfer , but now with the full set of stellar structure equations .",
    "we again assume conservative mass transfer , but now require the donor star to exactly fill its roche lobe throughout mass transfer .",
    "the results of this exercise are shown in fig .",
    "[ mdot_3_2msun ] , showing mass transfer rates as a function of donor mass on the same scale as fig .",

    "<S> we identify the critical binary mass ratio for the onset of dynamical time scale mass transfer as that ratio for which the adiabatic response of the donor star radius to mass loss matches that of its roche lobe at some point during mass transfer ; if the ratio of donor to accretor masses exceeds this critical value , dynamical time scale mass transfer ensues .    in common envelope evolution , the dissipation of orbital energy of the binary provides the energy to eject the common envelope ; the energy budget for this process consists essentially of the initial orbital energy of the binary and the initial self - energies of the binary components . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that , because stellar core and envelope contribute mutually to each other s gravitational potential energy , proper evaluation of the total energy of a star requires integration over the entire stellar interior , not the ejected envelope alone as commonly assumed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the change in total energy of the donor star , as a function of its remaining mass along an adiabatic mass - loss sequence , can be calculated either by integration over initial and final models , or by a path integral along the mass - loss sequence . </S>",
    "<S> that change in total energy of the donor star , combined with the requirement that both remnant donor and its companion star fit within their respective roche lobes , then circumscribes energetically possible survivors of common envelope evolution . </S>"
