    "field theory on noncommutative geometry , or noncommutative field theory ( ncft ) , for which there exists a respectable body of mathematical and physical knowledge ( see [ 1]-[15 ] and references therein ) , is most often performed over a moyal space @xmath0 , a deformed d - dimensional space endowed with a constant moyal @xmath1bracket of coordinate functions @xmath2_{\\star } = i \\theta^{\\mu\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a @xmath4 non - degenerate skew - symmetric matrix ( which requires d even ) , usually chosen in canonical form as @xmath5 @xmath60 , + \\infty[\\ni\\theta $ ] is a square length dimensional parameter , ( @xmath7 = [ l]^2 $ ] ) .",
    "the corresponding product of functions is the associative , noncommutative moyal - groenewold - weyl product , simply called hereafter moyal product or @xmath8-product defined by @xmath9 @xmath10 is the ordinary multiplication of functions and @xmath11 - the space of suitable schwartzian functions . for precise definition ,",
    "see [ 11]-[14 ] .",
    "such a noncommutative geometry possesses the specific pathology to break both the lorentz invariance by the presence of @xmath12 , as @xmath13_{\\star } = i \\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] is not generally invariant under rotation , and the local character of the theory thanks to the property that @xmath14 is evaluated through a two - point kernel @xmath15 besides , the uncertainty principle is expressed by @xmath16 . for more details on the ncft characterization , see",
    "[ 11 ] and references therein .",
    "peculiar features of noncommutative field theories ( ncft ) in the moyal @xmath8-product description generally engender energy momentum tensors ( emts ) which are not locally conserved , not traceless in the massless situation and , not symmetric and not gauge invariant in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "noether s procedure for infinitesimal translation symmetry in noncommutative ( nc ) scalar field theory has been studied by gerhold _ et al._@xcite and by abou - zeid and dorn @xcite . according to their works",
    ", the canonical emt appears to be symmetric albeit not locally conserved . from algebraic techniques , it can be obtained an improved locally conserved emt @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this improved tensor fails to be symmetric .",
    "it is noteworthy that , in classical field theory , a symmetric emt is related to a locally conserved angular momentum .",
    "further , in ncft , the constant tensor @xmath17 $ ] , characterizing the noncommutative geometry , is not a lorentz tensor and obviously breaks the lorentz invariance .",
    "therefore , the nonlocal conservation of angular momentum and then the asymmetry of emt are _ a priori _ allowed .    nc versions of noether currents have been worked out for translation , dilatation and local gauge symmetries @xcite-@xcite .",
    "so far , all these studies have been performed before the advent of the new class of renormalizable nc field theories ( ncrft ) built on the grosse and wulkenhaar @xmath18 scalar field theory @xcite .    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "an explicit formulation of an analogue of the noether theorem in moyal ncfts has been provided at the operator level as follows .",
    "given @xmath19 the global canonical nc ward identity operator ( wiop ) for a transformation , then the following statement holds :    * theorem * ( nc noether theorem , ben geloun and hounkonnou ) : _ if a nc action @xmath20 is invariant under a set of transformations , then @xmath21 and there exists a globally conserved vector current @xmath22 .",
    "_    albeit the local conservation of the current is not required , many facts invite us to consider this statement as actually the best of what we can expect from the nc action formulation .",
    "indeed , @xmath23 it is the nc method the closest of usual noether procedure ; @xmath24 in nc space - space @xmath25 geometry , there exists an exactly conserved @xmath26-vector momentum @xmath27 for infinitesimal translation symmetry which readily generalizes its undeformed counterpart ; @xmath28 it can be proved that regularization procedures improve quantities to recover local conservation property for many field theories and @xmath29 finally , at the parameter limit @xmath30 the globally conserved currents obtained through the nc wiop method reduce to classical noether currents .",
    "recently , this statement has been successfully applied to investigate emts in renormalizable noncommutative scalar field theory @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give , as another original contribution , an application of the above nc noether theorem in the framework of the nc complex grosse - wulkenhaar ( gw ) model , to perform the local conservation of energy - momentum tensors ( emts ) , using improvement procedures based on moyal algebraic techniques , as well as to analyze the broken dilatation symmetry and to explicitly compute nc gauge currents .",
    "the nc complex grosse - wulkenhaar lagrangian action can be written as : @xmath31 & = & \\int d^{d}x\\,\\big[\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\star\\partial^{\\mu } { \\bar \\phi } + m^{2}\\phi\\star{\\bar \\phi } + \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{2}(\\tilde{x}_{\\mu}\\phi)\\star ( \\tilde{x}^{\\mu}{\\bar \\phi } ) \\cr & + & \\frac{\\lambda}{2.4!}(\\phi\\star{\\bar \\phi}\\star\\phi \\star{\\bar \\phi } + \\phi\\star{\\bar \\phi}\\star{\\bar \\phi}\\star\\phi)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath3 breaks into diagonal blocks @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is a complex scalar field ( with rapid decay ) .",
    "the harmonic term @xmath35 ensures ultraviolet ( uv)/infrared ( ir ) freedom for the action implying its renormalizability , and such that the lagrangian action becomes covariant under langmann - szabo duality @xcite , i.e. covariant under the symmetry : @xmath36 the lagrangian density depending explicitly on @xmath37 , through the field @xmath34 interaction with a harmonic external source , does not describe a closed system .",
    "furtheremore , it is not invariant under space - time translation . besides",
    ", at the parameter limit @xmath38 , the model does not converge to the ordinary @xmath18 scalar field theory due to the presence of the inverse matrix @xmath39 , then causing a singularity .",
    "the @xmath8-grosse - wulkenhaar @xmath40 theory is renormalizable at all orders in @xmath41 .",
    "this result has been now proved by various methods ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is a matter of algebra to recast the grosse - wulkenhaar harmonic term as @xmath42 and to re - express accordingly the action ( [ eq : action ] ) so that it now entirely lies in the @xmath8-algebra of fields with the advantage to be stable under formal @xmath8-algebraic computations ( such that the cyclicity of @xmath8-factors under integral ) .",
    "we get the equations of motion for @xmath34 and @xmath43 as follows : @xmath44 @xmath45 one avoids translational invariance violation for the appearance of the coordinate @xmath46 by considering further the constraint @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 from infinitesimal translations , we can now define the global canonical ward identity operator for the nc complex gw model @xmath49 such that its action on the lagrangian density @xmath50 gives the canonical energy momentum tensor ( emt ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the euclidean metric , @xmath53 the nc lagrangian , @xmath54 the @xmath8-anticommutator .",
    "the emt then conserves its form comparatively to the result of @xcite .",
    "@xmath55 is symmetric , nonlocally conserved , and in massless theory , not traceless .",
    "moreover , putting the mass term to zero , the usual improved tensor @xmath56 is not traceless too .",
    "let us investigate now an improvement to ( [ eq : emt ] ) for the local conservation order .",

    "thus the `` wulkenization '' @xcite process clearly governs the emt improvement mechanism . a closer look on ( [ local ] ) shows that @xmath60 is globally conserved , as in ncft the @xmath8-commutators under integral cancel . for physical interpretation ,",
    "let us consider the space - space ncft determined by @xmath61 .",
    "then one can readily prove that there exists a conserved @xmath26-vector momentum @xmath62 , namely @xmath63 .",
    "such a vector conserved quantity is also observed in the _ naive _ ( unrenormalizable ) nc scalar field @xcite as well as in the nc real gw model @xcite . besides , it turns out that",
    ", displaying the same tedious algebraic apparatus as in @xcite , a correction term can be provided to get a new locally conserved albeit nonsymmetric emt , @xmath64 , with nonvanishing trace for m = 0 recalling that the theory is not scale invariant .",
    "furtheremore , one can work out a symmetric locally conserved emt through the ordinary belifante trick ( see @xcite and references therein ) , defining the tensor @xmath65 such that @xmath66 the underlying belifante type partial differential equation @xmath67}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is less comfortable than the one worked out by abou - zeid and dorn @xcite",
    ". more detailed consideration of various properties of emts will appear elsewhere .",
    "let us now better scrutinize the nonlocal conservation of the canonical massless emt .",
    "it obviously induces a dilatation symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , even if an improved locally conserved emt is provided , the scale invariance is no longer valid and predictable since the evidence of a nonvanishing trace of this improved emt .",
    "both these arguments on dilatation symmetry breaking are valid for massless grosse and wulkenhaar model .",
