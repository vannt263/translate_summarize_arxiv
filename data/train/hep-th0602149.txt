    "they considered a pure 5-dimensional ( 5d ) einstein gravity only with a cosmological constant in a bulk . in this scenario the effective 4d einstein equations are obtained by projecting the 5d metric onto the brane @xcite . whereas in a string / m - theory context one would also expect additional scalar fields , associated with the many moduli fields , as fundamental fields .",

    "a brane world inflation with bulk scalar fields is discussed by himemoto and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "they proposed a `` bulk inflaton model '' in which the inflation on the brane is caused by a scalar field in the bulk , but the bulk itself is not inflating .",

    "we then conclude that a singular single - brane instanton is possible if @xmath90 .",
    "the action of the instanton solutions does not have any minimum with respect to the positions of branes .",
    "then we can not adopt the least action principle to predict the initial state of a brane universe .",
    "taking into account some quantum corrections for a bulk potential or tension via susy breaking process , we have also investigated possibility of de sitter brane instanton solution .",
