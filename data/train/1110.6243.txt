    "a signature beyond the standard model has been searched by the tevatron at fermilab ( fermi national accelerator laboratory ) and by the lhc ( large hadron collider ) at cern ( european organization for nuclear research ) .",
    "so far , no explicit signature has been found yet . however , the cdf ( collider detector at fermilab ) collaboration reported a possible discovery of new phenomenon in high-@xmath9-lepton plus dijet production with missing @xmath10 in @xmath0 collisions at the center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev @xcite .",
    "they showed the @xmath1+dijet cross section and other possible contributions as a function of the dijet mass @xmath11 .",
    "their data indicated an anomalous peak in the region @xmath12 gev .",
    "it is anomalous in the sense that such an excess is difficult to be explained within the standard model . on the other hand",
    ", such a peak can not be found in another tevatron experiment d0 @xcite , so that it may take time to settle down this issue experimentally .",
    "we may recollect that there was an issue of jet - cross section excess in a cdf experiment of 1996 @xcite .",
    "jet - production cross sections were measured in the @xmath0 collisions , and the data were shown as a function of jet transverse energy ( @xmath10 ) . since the cross sections were significantly larger than the qcd predications in the energy region @xmath13 gev , the excess used to be considered as a signature beyond the standard model .",
    "however , it turned out that the jet excess could be explained if the gluon distribution is modified at large @xmath7 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , where @xmath7 is the momentum fraction of a gluon in the nucleon .    for explaining the new cdf data of 2011 , interesting theoretical ideas have been proposed @xcite mostly by models beyond the standard model .",
    "the ideas include new @xmath15 boson , supersymmetry , higgs boson , relation to string theory , and so on .",
    "however , the experience on the cdf - jet issue of 1996 indicates that careful studies should be done within the standard model , particularly by estimating effects of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .    a fraction of the proton or antiproton beam energy 980 gev ( = 1.96 tev /2 ) needs to be transferred to one of the dijets with the energy about 70 gev ( = 140 gev /2 ) .",
    "therefore , the relevant region of the momentum fraction @xmath7 for initial partons is @xmath16 .",
    "this is a very rough estimate because some of the beam momentum should be carried , for example , by @xmath1 in the final state .",
    "we need to check whether the pdfs are well determined in this @xmath7 region in order to warrant the possibility that the cdf result is a new discovery beyond the standard model .",
    "the pdfs of the nucleon have been investigated for many years , and they may be considered to be established except for extreme kinematical conditions .",
    "in fact , the valence - quark distributions are rather well determined due to abundant charged - lepton deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) data together with neutrino dis ones by using strong constraints of charge and baryon - number conservations .",
    "there is a recent issue of a nuclear modification difference between the charged - lepton and neutrino reactions @xcite .",
    "it affects the determination of valence - quark distributions because neutrino - nucleus dis data are used for extracting  nucleonic \" pdfs .",
    "however , it should not be large enough to affect the cdf anomaly",
    ".    on the other hand , antiquark distributions are not well determined , particularly for strange and heavy quarks .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 distributions also have some uncertainties ; however , they are relatively well determined in the region @xmath19 due to drell - yan experiments at fermilab in combination with dis measurements @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a new drell - yan experiment is currently in progress at fermilab @xcite , and it could be continued at other hadron facilities such as the j - parc ( japan proton accelerator research complex ) @xcite .",
    "the gluon distribution function @xmath20 played an important role in explaining the cdf jet result in 1996 @xcite .",
    "however , it may not be a significant contribution in the present case because @xmath20 is constrained by scaling - violation measurements of the hera ( hadron - electron ring accelerator ) except for the distribution in the large-@xmath7 region .",
    "therefore , the first parton distribution , which we need to consider in connection with the new cdf anomaly , is the strange - quark distribution .",
    "the strange - quark distribution @xmath8 may have been thought to be determined from the opposite - sign dimuon measurements in neutrino - induced dis .",
    "current situation is summarized in ref .",
    "there are some variations among experimental groups ; however , @xmath21 is 30@xmath2250% of the light - antiquark distribution @xmath23 . by considering the neutrino measurements ,",
    "all the global pdf analysis had been done by assuming that @xmath24 has the same @xmath7-dependence with @xmath25 until recently .",
    "there are some recent attempts to assign more flexible functional forms which are independent of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , the strange - quark distribution is not accurately constrained as typically shown by large uncertainties of @xmath8 by the ct10 parametrization @xcite .    in 2008 ,",
    "the hermes collaboration cast doubt on the conventional strange - quark distribution @xcite .",
    "they measured semi - inclusive hadron production in charged - lepton dis and they obtained a very different strange - quark distribution from the ones by global analyses with the neutrino dis data .",
    "the distribution @xmath8 is much softer than usual global - analysis distributions at @xmath26=2.5 gev@xmath27 .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 is two - times larger than the usual one at @xmath28 and it is much smaller at @xmath29 .",
    "of course , hadron - production analysis depend much on the employed fragmentation functions , which have large uncertainties for kaon functions @xcite .",
    "such an ambiguity needs to be considered in evaluating the hermes result seriously .",
    "the light antiquark distributions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are considered to be equal in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) because they are produced from the gluon splitting process @xmath33 and their masses are expected to be negligible in comparison with a hard scale of a reaction . of course",
    ", higher - order pqcd corrections could give rise to differences between @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath34 because of @xmath26 evolution with a mixing term @xmath35 in a splitting function at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) together with differences between the initial distributions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "however , such nlo effects are not large enough to explain the measured differences , so that a non - perturbative mechanism is needed for explaining the differences between @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath34 . for the details of these non - perturbative models , the reader may look at ref .",
