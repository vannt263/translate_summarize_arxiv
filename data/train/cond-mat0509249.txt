    "as a result of technical advances in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) methods , it has become possible to measure the quasiparticle spectrum at surfaces of a variety of materials over large areas with both atomic spatial resolution and mv energy resolution . while stm is a powerful and direct probe of electronic wavefunctions , the interpretation of stm spectra generally requires comparison with a model spectrum calculated using approximate many - body techniques ( for example , the local density approximation ) . this can be problematic in situations where details of the surface are poorly known , or where traditional theoretical methods fail , as in the high temperature superconductors .",
    "the question of how one can usefully analyze stm spectral maps without a detailed quantitative model of the electronic structure is therefore paramount .",
    "recently , it was shown that details of the quasiparticle dispersion can be extracted from the spatial fourier transform of stm spectra on disordered surfaces.@xcite the technique is often referred to as fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ftsts ) and requires that maps of the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath2 at energy @xmath3 be made over reasonably large surface areas , from which the fourier transform , @xmath4 , can be obtained . in the simplest case , that of noninteracting quasiparticles , the ldos at position @xmath5 and energy @xmath3 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath8 quasiparticle eigenstate with energy @xmath9 . for a clean surface ,",
    "@xmath7 are bloch states of the form @xmath10 with wavevector @xmath11 and band index @xmath12 , and latexmath:[$\\rho({{\\bf r}},\\omega)=\\sum_{j,{{\\bf k } } }    only the spatial periodic modulations of the unit cell . however , in the presence of defects , the eigenstates contain mixtures of bloch states with different values of @xmath11 , and the probability density @xmath14 exhibits standing wave patterns ( friedel oscillations ) arising from the interference between these different @xmath11-values . near an isolated impurity , for example , one can decompose the eigenstates at energy @xmath3 into initial and final ( scattered ) states with wavevectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively . then",
    ", the fourier transformed density of states ( ftdos ) is peaked at wavevectors @xmath17 for which @xmath16 and @xmath15 lie on constant energy contours of energy @xmath3 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : in panel ( a ) the ftdos is calculated ( details given later ) at the fermi energy @xmath18 for a single impurity in a 2d tight - binding metal whose fermi surface is shown in panel ( b ) . the arrows @xmath19 and @xmath20 in ( b ) label transitions between states on the fermi surface which contribute to the maxima at @xmath19 and @xmath20 in ( a ) .",
    "there is , therefore , a direct connection between @xmath1 and the quasiparticle energy dispersion @xmath21 .",
    "the possibility of using ftsts to map out @xmath21 was first demonstrated by sprunger _",
    "et al._@xcite and ftsts has since been used by several groups to study metal surfaces,@xcite semiconductors,@xcite semimetals,@xcite and strongly - correlated superconductors.@xcite quite recently , an extension of this technique to study inelastic scattering in strongly - correlated superconductors has been proposed.@xcite    the usefulness of the ftsts method , however , is limited by the large signal - to - noise ratio which is invariably present .",
    "this is an intrinsic problem , as we now illustrate , which arises from the randomness of the impurity positions .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that a random distribution of @xmath22 identical impurities sit at sites @xmath23 , @xmath24 and that the impurities do not interfere substantially , so that each impurity modifies the ldos by an amount @xmath25 .",
    "this term is meant to describe the friedel oscillations in the vicinity of an isolated impurity , and its fourier transform @xmath26 is the quantity one wishes to study experimentally . for simplicity , we will ignore sub - unit - cell modulations of the ldos due to the crystalline potential so that the ldos is uniform in the absence of impurities .",
    "then , with the impurities present , @xmath27 , and it follows that @xmath28\\delta_{{{\\bf q}},0 } + \\delta \\rho({{\\bf q}},\\omega ) \\sqrt{n_i } f({{\\bf q } } ) , \\label{ftdos1}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the fourier transform of the scattering pattern due to a",

    "( [ ftdos1 ] ) was first demonstrated in the limit of weak impurities by capriotti _",
    "et al._@xcite and then for a dilute distribution of pointlike impurities of arbitrary strength by zhu _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "we make two comments regarding eq .",
    "( [ ftdos1 ] ) .",
    "first , for a _ particular _ disorder configuration , and for @xmath35 , @xmath1 is the product of a useful signal @xmath36 and a noise term @xmath37 . in practice",
    ", this means that the noise is as large as the signal , and that it can be nearly impossible to resolve the fine details of the ftdos spectrum which have been predicted in numerous calculations .",
    "this is particularly true in the cuprate superconductors , which are inherently dirty materials .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the ftdos is shown for a 2d metal for both a single point scatterer in panel ( a ) , and a random configuration of 3% impurities in panel ( c ) ( the details of the calculation will be given below ) .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates the difficulty one faces when dealing with disordered systems ; while the ftdos pattern is visible in ( c ) , one would have difficulty making a quantitative comparison of the structure with ( a ) .",
    "the second comment is that in nearly all calculations to date , @xmath26 has been calcuated in the clean limit , ie .  for a single impurity .",
    "this approximation captures many qualitative features of the spectrum , but also risks failing when the scattering rate is large , as appears to be the case in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "it is natural to assume that disorder , in addition to producing noise , must introduce a quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath38 which broadens @xmath39 , but it is in fact not obvious .",
    "formally , the elastic scattering rate appears when one averages a large number of impurity configurations , and is not defined when one studies a particular configuration of impurities .",
    "if , for example , we try to take the disorder average @xmath40 , where @xmath41 indicates a configuration average , we find that since @xmath37 is a sum of random phases , @xmath42 and @xmath43 \\delta_{{{\\bf q}},0}.\\ ] ] in other words , one does not simply find that @xmath1 is broadened by disorder , but rather that in the process of configuration averaging @xmath1 , one loses the finite-@xmath32 signal altogether .    .",
    "( a ) @xmath1 is plotted for a single pointlike impurity embedded in a @xmath44 lattice .",
    "the fermi surface contour @xmath45 is shown in ( b ) .",
    "arrows @xmath19 and @xmath20 show the scattering transitions producing the features labelled @xmath19 and @xmath20 in ( a ) .",

    "[ numerics ] .",
    "finally , we show in sec .",
    "[ diagrammatic ] that one can develop a diagrammatic perturbation theory for @xmath56 in which many - impurity effects can be understood systematically .",
    "one useful consequence of these calculations is a demonstration that the mean free path can be extracted from ftsts spectra .",
    "a summary of these results will be presented in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "for a finite number @xmath46 of impurity configurations , the variance of the ftdos is latexmath:[$\\langle \\delta\\rho^2({{\\bf q}},\\omega ) \\rangle_{n_\\textrm{cfg } } \\equiv \\langle|\\rho({{\\bf q}},\\omega)|^2\\rangle_{n_\\textrm{cfg } } -    @xmath46 finite for the moment because , in practical applications where it can be time consuming to obtain spectra of the disordered system , one might find that it is only possible to average over a relatively small number of configurations , and it is therefore useful to understand how the noise scales with @xmath46 .",
    "configuration averaging is performed by averaging over sets of impurity positions denoted by @xmath58 with @xmath59 indicating the different configurations , and @xmath24 labelling impurities .",

    "[ fig2 ] that the spectrum generally scales as @xmath90 as expected .",

    "<S> fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ftsts ) is a useful technique for extracting details of the momentum - resolved electronic band structure from inhomogeneities in the local density of states due to disorder - related quasiparticle scattering . to a large extent , </S>",
    "<S> current understanding of ftsts is based on models of friedel oscillations near isolated impurities . here , </S>",
    "<S> a framework for understanding many - impurity effects is developed based on a systematic treatment of the variance @xmath0 of the fourier transformed local density of states @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> one important consequence of this work is a demonstration that the poor signal - to - noise ratio inherent in @xmath1 due to randomness in impurity positions can be eliminated by configuration averaging @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we develop a diagrammatic perturbation theory for @xmath0 and show that an important bulk quantity , the mean - free - path , can be extracted from ftsts experiments . </S>"
