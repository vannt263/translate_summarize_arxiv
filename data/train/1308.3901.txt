    "the osculating orbital period of about 700 years determined for comet c/2011 w3 ( lovejoy ) , the most recent spectacular member of the kreutz system of sungrazers ( sekanina & chodas 2012 ) , rules out this comet s identity with any known kreutz sungrazer . in particular , it can not represent the return of any member of this system that has arrived to perihelion since the 17th century ( kreutz 1901 , marsden 1967 ) , thus providing another example of the immense complexity of this  comet  . with about 2000 minor members known ,",
    "thanks to the ongoing vigorous search by amateur astronomers in images exposed with the coronagraphs on board the _ and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( soho ; see brueckner et al .",
    "1995 ) and , more recently , also with the coronagraphs on board the two spacecraft of the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _",
    "( stereo ; see howard et al .",
    "2008 ) , the relationship between the minor sungrazers and comet c/2011  w3 needs to be addressed .",
    "for example , did the temporal distribution of the soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers change on account of the impending arrival of c/2011 w3 ?",
    "is there any evidence for changes in the brightness distribution of these minor sungrazers ?",
    "if yes , how could any such changes be interpreted ? and could the results be employed in the future to forecast the _ imminent _ arrival of another spectacular sungrazer ?",
    "the prediction , published several years ago ( sekanina & chodas 2007 ) , of another cluster of bright sungrazers to appear in the coming decades was already commented on ( sekanina & chodas 2012 ) .",
    "based on a study of the long - term evolution of the kreutz system , this prediction was borne out by c/2011 w3 , the expected cluster s first apparent member . in comparison , a successful effort aimed at forecasting the arrival of a strikingly bright sungrazer we refer to at the end of sec .",
    "1 is meant to confine the object s appearance to a temporally much more constrained window .    to address the raised questions ,",
    "we begin with the distribution , between 2004 and 2013 , of arrival times of the soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers that were at their maximum brighter than apparent magnitude 3 ; they are referred to hereafter as the _ bright dwarf _ sungrazers . like the fainter kreutz minicomets , they all failed to survive perihelion .",
    "we felt that the interval of nearly eight years is more than sufficient to cover all interesting objects in the soho / stereo population that preceded , yet might still show a potential relationship to , c/2011  w3 .",
    "we should emphasize that because the definition of a bright dwarf sungrazer is entirely arbitrary , the limit at apparent magnitude 3 should be regarded only as a crude constraint . indeed , because of soho s and stereo s instrumental limitations and biases as well as operational practices and options ( e.g. , orange vs.  clear filters , variable image cadence , uneven duty cycle , etc . ; see knight et al .",
    "2010 for a comprehensive photometric analysis ) , it could be very difficult to determine a magnitude with much accuracy and virtually impossible to establish its equivalent value in any standard photometric band .",
    "for example , to avoid mixing the clear - filter and orange - filter magnitudes for objects observed with soho s c2 and/or c3 coronagraphs is practically unfeasible , because this problem is intrinsic to the data - acquisition process .",
    "the resulting color index is known to show an enormous scatter of several magnitudes ( knight et al .",
    "2010 ) and even though systematic trends are vaguely detected , a color correction inferred from the statistics can never be warranted to indiscriminately apply to any particular sungrazer s magnitude and is not necessarily better than no correction . among the brightest comets listed by knight et al .",
    ", such as c/1998  k10 , c/2000  h2 , or c/2003",
    "k7 , the color index is indeed near zero .",
    "the objects that satisfy our definition of a bright dwarf sungrazer are summarized in table  1 , which presents 19  selected objects .",
    "the magnitude of most is at maximum brightness in the c2 coronagraph , even though some may have peaked in c3 , with no such data being available . only for a few listed sungrazers",
    "the brightness was measured in c3 .",
    "the magnitudes were taken from various data sources , as indicated . because of uncertainties , borderline cases are unavoidable .",
    "it is always possible that one or two listed objects may , in a uniform photometric system , be somewhat fainter than the chosen magnitude limit , while the brightness of a very few comets not included may just barely exceed it . in any case , we regard the set as a fairly representative sample .",

    "some of the objects were compared with other sungrazers , whose maximum brightness was reported to have been near apparent magnitude  3 , by inspecting the soho s c2 and c3 coronagraphic movies .",
    "known magnitudes for these comparisons were taken primarily from knight et al .",
    "the second author s website blog , which provides a table of bright kreutz sungrazers , proved especially useful in compiling table  1 .",
    "also , his determination that the detector of the soho s c2 coronagraph begins to saturate by objects of apparent magnitude @xmath01.5 allows one to instantly set an upper or lower brightness limit by just looking at the image .",
    "the arguments for including some objects are presented in the table s footnotes , which also provide information on the electronic blogs . finally , the properties of the chosen set of soho / stereo sungrazers brighter at maximum light than apparent magnitude  3 is in the following compared with the properties of a subset , the sungrazers brighter at maximum light than magnitude  2 .",
    "the magnitudes of most of these objects were determined from c2 imaging and come from the second author s website.@xmath5    while the number of bright soho / stereo sungrazers is limited , their advantage is that they are practically free from the selection effects that influence the detection of fainter kreutz minicomets .",
    "in particular , strong annual double - peak variations in the discovery rate from images taken with the c2 coronagraph are due to periodic orientation changes in the kreutz comets orbital plane relative to earth ( sekanina 2002 ; knight et al",
    ".  2010 ) :  the more prominent peak occurs in may , while the less pronounced but much more extended one covers october - december ( e.g. , knight et al.s figure 13 ) .",
    "one of the deep minima is in january and , accordingly , in a set of 19 objects there should be none during that month . yet , in table  1 we have two of them , consistent with an essentially random annual - distribution sample .    for the years 20042013 ,",
    "the cumulative distributions of arrival times of the soho / stereo sungrazers brighter at their maximum than , respectively , apparent magnitude  3 and 2 are plotted in figure  1 , in which the entries from table  1 are fitted with a polynomial of the 4th power modified at the ends .",
    "the arrival time is the calendar date of the first observation in soho s c3 coronagraph , which is shown in column  2 of table  1 . because no kreutz sungrazer can enter the field of view of the soho s c3 coronagraph earlier than less than 5 days",
    " and the field of view of the c2 coronagraph earlier than less than 0.5 day  before perihelion , the difference between the arrival time and the perihelion time is negligible on the scale of figure  1 .",
    "the reason for choosing this approximation is the fact that perihelion times of nearly all sungrazers that have arrived since the beginning of 2011 are not yet available .",
    "the upper curve in figure 1 illustrates the rapidly increasing number of bright soho / stereo sungrazers starting in 2008 , while the lower curve , based on 13 objects , a year or two later .",
    "the overall shapes of the two distribution curves are similar , except for the slightly less steep rate of growth of the lower curve , as expected .",
    "this fact strengthens our confidence that we deal with representative sets of bright dwarf sungrazers . both distributions",
    " especially the upper one  do , however , display pronounced local deviations from the fitted polynomials , appearing as step - like features separated from each other by gaps extending over several months .",
    "their nature will be addressed in sec .",
    "no sungrazers were brighter at maximum light than magnitude  3 in 20042005 , although in 2003 , just off the scale of figure  1 , two were brighter : c/2003  f5 and c/2003  k7 . from table 2 of knight",
    "( 2010 ) , which includes only those kreutz sungrazers whose brightness peaked in c3 , it follows that during the decade 19962005 there was a total of eight soho sungrazers brighter at maximum than magnitude 3 , suggesting an average rate of 0.8 per year .",
    "knight et al.s list does not though include c/1996  y1 and c/2001  g2 , both of which according to kracht ( see footnote 2 ) were brighter at maximum than magnitude  1 .",
    "for the same period of time , kracht lists eight sungrazers  or an average of 0.8 per year  that , mostly in c2 , reached at maximum at least apparent magnitude  1 , the same rate as that implied by knight et al.s data but for clearly brighter objects .    by differentiating the polynomial approximations to the curves in figure 1 , we derived the smoothed arrival - rate distributions of the bright soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers in figure 2 .",
    "the arrival - rate curves  poorly determined before and in early 2008 and again from late 2012 on  tend to converge to zero in 2006 and 2014 .    from figure 2 ,",
    "the times of peak arrival rate are 2010.88 ( @xmath0mid - november 2010 ) for the dwarf sungrazers brighter at maximum light than magnitude 3 and 2011.35 ( @xmath0early may 2011 ) for those brighter at maximum light than magnitude 2 . with the larger",
    "set assigned a greater weight and with an estimated uncertainty of two to four months in the times of peak arrival rate , we conclude that , on the average , this group of _ bright dwarf sungrazers preceded the arrival of c/2011 w3 by just about one year , which suggests a potentially close relationship between both_.    the polynomial fitting indicates that the smoothed peak arrival rates were @xmath04.6 and @xmath04.3 objects per year , respectively , for the two sets of data , showing that the arrival rate of sungrazers with a magnitude at their maximum between 2 and 3 was only about 0.3 per year . at much lower arrival rates before 2009 , the difference could not possibly have been any greater than this . for illustration , figure 2 shows the pre-2008 constant rates of 1.3 per year for the sungrazers brighter at maximum light than magnitude  3 and 1.0 per year for those brighter than magnitude 2 .",
    "the relatively flat magnitude distribution function of the bright soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers is also documented by the surprising merger of the two curves in figure 2 at times starting in the second half of 2011 , suggesting a deficit of the sungrazers with magnitudes at maximum light between 2 and 3 . only to a degree",
    "may this property of the distribution function be affected by insufficient data .",
    "the same probably also applies to the precipitous dropoff rate during 2012 , which in figure 2 appears steeper than the rate of rise before 2011 and which is of course a product of a deficit of bright dwarf sungrazers during much of 2012 .     + orbital elements and apsidal orientation of bright soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers from the years 20042013 + compared with the orbital data for spectacular comets c/1843 d1 and c/2011 w3 ( eq.j2000.0 ) .",

    "serve here to examine the similarity of their orbits to those of c/1843  d1 and c/2011  w3 . for each sungrazer ,",
    "table 5 provides the number of observations used , the coronagraphs employed , and the rms residuals from gray s best - fit parabolic solution and from the elliptical orbits for c/1843  d1 ( sekanina & chodas 2008 ) and c/2011  w3 ( sekanina & chodas 2012 ) in columns  2 to 6 , respectively .",
    "the last column conveys our conclusion whether or not each of the objects is likely to be associated with c/1843  d1 and therefore with the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers .",
    "a cursory glance through gray s list of orbits suggests at once that up to five of them have angular orbital elements that resemble those of c/1843",
    "they include the three most extensively observed among the 22  sungrazers  c/2010",
    "y10 , c/2010  y15 , and c/2010  x14 , which are in table  5 labeled with a star .",
    "the other two sungrazers are c/2010  x16 and c/2010  y12 . the number of observations , on which their orbits are based , are comparable to those for the orbits of c/2010  x12 and c/2010  x17 , which do not resemble that of c/1843  d1 , yet the residuals from their forced solutions in colmn  5 are nearly as good as those from the best - fit solutions .",
    "thus , for c/2010  x16 and c/2010  y12 the orbital agreement with c/1843  d1 does not offer much confidence in the quality of the published solutions and a comparison of the residuals in columns  5 and 6 should be the decisive criterion , just as is the case with the rest of table  5 .",
    "overall , the mean residuals in columns  5 and 6 suggest that the orbits of 19 of the 22 objects are better , usually much better , fitted by the orbit of c/1843  d1 than c/2011  w3 . the association with the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers is well established for 17 , a little less so for c/2010  y12 ( because of the competing residuals in columns  5 and 6 ) , and problematic but still possible for c/2010  x13 ( because of the very small number of used observations ) .",
    "we have serious doubts about the direct relationship to the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers only for three members of the clump in table  5 :  c/2010  x11 , c/2010  x15 , and c/2010  y14 .",
    "information on the first object is based on only five observations , while other two show nearly equal mean residuals from the two reference orbits ; there is thus very little evidence on which a judgment could be predicated .    as a general comment on column 5 of table  5 , the high mean residuals from the orbit of comet c/1843  d1 displayed by c/2010  x14",
    ", c/2010  x16 , c/2010  y2 , and c/2010  y7 are a product of these objects perihelion distances appreciably exceeding that of c/1843  d1 , and should not alarm the reader .    we conclude that a _ great majority of the clump of faint kreutz sungrazers from the period of december 1320 , 2010 was associated with c/1843  d1 and therefore with the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers_.    nothing definite can at present be concluded about the clump of faint soho / stereo sungrazers from december 2011 .",
    "this problem must wait until the astrometric positions and orbits of these sungrazers become available .",
    "the spike - like features in the distribution of arrivals of faint soho / stereo kreutz minicomets have their counterparts among the bright dwarf sungrazers as well ( step - like features ; see sec .  2 and figure 1 ) .",
    "the four objects brighter at maximum than magnitude  3 that arrived between 2010.00 and 2010.27 ( c/2009  y4 , c/2010  b3 , c/2010  e6 , and c/2010  g4 ) fit a slope distinctly steeper than the polynomial s slope and so do the three objects between 2010.80 and 2010.88 ( c/2010  u8 , c/2010  v8 , and c/2010  w2 ) .",
    "the equivalent rates are , respectively , @xmath015 and nearly 40 per year , several times greater than the peak rate of the smoothed distribution .",
    "we detect a yet another effect that shows that during the few years around 2010 the distribution in figure 3 behaves untypically .",
    "it is the relation between the may and the october - december peaks that we already mentioned in sec .  2 .",
    "while the may spikes are never smaller than the october - december spikes in 20042007 and 2012 , the former are outperformed by the latter in 20082011 .",
    "the cumulative distribution of arrival times of all kreutz sungrazers seen with the soho and stereo coronagraphs between 2004 and 2013 is presented in figure 4 , in which we plot the number of objects after each six - day interval of time .",
    "the averaged slope of the distribution is practically constant until about the end of 2008 , then it picks up a little , as can be expected from the distribution in figure 3 .",
    "peculiar features on the cumulative - distribution curve in figure 4 are flat segments or `` flats , '' _ fairly prolonged _ intervals of time during which the distribution curve essentially levels off , with a zero or near - zero arrival rate of the soho / stereo sungrazers .",
    "their times do not correlate well with those of soho s roll and must be a true property of the kreutz population s distribution along the orbit . because of the extremely compressed scale in figure 4 , the flats appear very short .",
    "the appearance of flats is in greater detail illustrated on a section of the cumulative distribution in figure 5 .",
    "each flat was required to satisfy at least one of two conditions :  either no sungrazers detected to arrive for a minimum of three six - day consecutive intervals , or their total number not exceeding four over a minimum of five six - day consecutive intervals .",
    "statistically , one would expect the highest rates of flats during 20042005 because of lower arrival rates , no high spikes on the distribution curve in figure  3 , and the absence of bright soho / stereo sungrazers .",
    "however , figure 4 shows that this was not the case , suggesting instead a seemingly counterintuitive positive correlation between the bright dwarf sungrazers arrival rate and the rate of flats on the cumulative - distribution curve during the period ending with 2008 :  there were no flats between the start of 2004 and mid-2006 , while during the next two years , between the arrivals of the bright sungrazers c/2006  a5 , c/2006  v2 , and c/2008  k4 , the average rate was 3 flats per year . from mid-2009",
    "to mid-2011 the rate of flats was nearly constant at 2 per year .",
    "the properties of the distribution of arrivals of the soho / stereo sungrazers in the years 20042013 illustrate the morphological complexity of the kreutz system , which is driven by  and can be understood qualitatively and , to a degree , even quantitatively , in terms of  a cascading fragmentation process , proposed by sekanina ( 2002 ) and in greater detail by sekanina and chodas ( 2007 ) . in this model ,",
    "the fragments continue to break up over and over again at all heliocentric distances , so that an enormous and _ essentially _ continuous stream of subfragments ( or high - generation fragments ) arrives at perihelion at any time .",
    "this stream , which forms a ring along the orbit , is , however , not structureless , and the degree of its nonuniformity varies from place to place on many spatial scales that are equivalent to time scales from days to dozens of years and longer .",
    "the segment of the kreutz system that arrived at perihelion in 20042005 was apparently characterized by a high degree of uniformity , while in the subsequent years the opposite was the case .",
    "the existence of brighter objects ( in figures 3 and 4 ) in the cloud of soho / stereo minicomets suggests that , among the sungrazers , they may consist of a material of a greater than average cohesion , so that their fragmentation rate is slower than that of other fragments in the stream . because their parent(s ) broke up less often and probably also at later times than the rest , the spatial distribution of subfragments that derive from such objects is less uniform and more cluster - like , which necessarily leads to greater variations and relatively often to _ gaps _ in their distribution along the orbit .",
    "these gaps show up as the flat segments on the cumulative - distribution curve .",
    "thus , to a point , the occurrence rate of flats should indeed vary in some proportion to the arrival rate of bright dwarf fragments .",
    "only when this rate increases significantly is there much more debris around , so that the number of flats begins to drop , but even then they should not be entirely absent .",
    "the orbital results for the bright dwarf sungrazers in table 2 , which completely rule out any potential relationship between their sharply elevated rate and comet c/2011  w3 , are supported by the evidence of very few _ faint _ soho / stereo kreutz minicomets in orbits similar to that of c/2011  w3 .",
    "table  6 shows that there were only nine such objects in the set of more than 1000 soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers between 2004 and 2013 with currently known orbits .",

    ", identified in sec .",
    "3 and table  2 , are the _ prime fragmentation products of the postulated object  their parent_. indeed , adding up the brightness contributions from the 16  sungrazers in table 1 leads to an equivalent of apparent magnitude @xmath42.0 , not much fainter than was c/2011  w3 ( whose apparent magnitude at maximum light was estimated at @xmath43 ; e.g. , green 2011 ) .",
    "second , a population of fainter dwarf sungrazers must be , in addition to the 16  bright ones , also derived from the same parent .",

    "third , a _ hint of a hierarchy in the distribution of fragment dimensions is perceived in both the swarm and the clump_. the swarm s brightest object , soho-2143 , is in about the same position relative to the apparent ends of the swarm modeled in figure 2 , as is the clump s most prominent object , c/2010  y10 , relative to the apparent ends of the clump . in both cases",

    "accordingly , they arrive at perihelion nearly simultaneously ( on a scale of the orbital period ) as a _ true swarm_. for illustration , table 7 lists the perturbations of the arrival time at next perihelion for a fragment that separated far from the sun with a typical velocity of 1  m  s@xmath17 in either of two cardinal directions in the plane of a sungrazing orbit with a perihelion distance of 1.2  @xmath16 and an orbital period of 900  years ( with aphelion at 186.43  au ) .",

    "there is no contribution from the normal component .",

    ", our discussion suggests that the orbital perturbations of fragments due to submeter- or meter - per - second separation velocities acquired during breakup events at large heliocentric distances are generally consistent with the systematic trends in the orbital elements in table 2 , supporting our hypothesis that the tightly - knit swarm of 16  bright dwarf sungrazers ( as well as a debris of additional , fragmented members of the swarm ) , peaking in 2010/2011 , consisted of fragments of an originally common parent , which itself must have been a fragment of a precursor that also gave birth to comet c/1843  d1 .",
    "this precursor could have been the celebrated comet x/1106",
    "c1 , as suggested by sekanina & chodas ( 2007 ) .",
    "the arrival time of the swarm , about 168 years after the appearance of c/1843  d1 , requires a relative separation velocity of only about 1  m  s@xmath17 between the swarm s parent and this 19th - century sungrazer , if they detached from x/1106  c1 right at perihelion , or somewhat greater than 1  m  s@xmath17 , if a little off the perihelion point , but in any case a velocity typical for separations of sungrazer fragments near perihelion ( sekanina & chodas 2007 ) .",
    "it is possible that c/1843  d1 , the swarm s parent , many additional sizable sungrazers as well as huge amounts of debris had separated from x/1106  c1 as a single object , which became subject to sudden or gradual fragmentation only during its liftoff through the precursor s atmosphere and/or soon afterwards .    because soho-2143 was clearly the brightest among the swarm s members ( table 1 ) , it is plausible to deem this sungrazer the most massive fragment , located near the position that would have been occupied by the parent had it survived intact .",
    "the swarm s 15 remaining objects are then products of one or more breakup events , in harmony with the conceptual paradigm of cascading fragmentation ( sekanina 2002 , sekanina & chodas 2007 ) . if the mechanism that accounts for the separation velocities causes them to prefer a certain direction",
    " such as , for example , the parent s spin  the contributions from the individual fragmentation events to the total perturbation effect would simply add up in some direction in an inertial coordinate system , to which the introduced coordinate system is , due to the orbit s extreme elongation , practically equivalent at any point far enough from perihelion .",
    "the task is now reduced to finding out whether it is at all possible to choose a limited number of , and appropriate locations for , the breakup events in which a swarm s fragment could have been reasonably involved , such that the respective orbital difference from table  2 is in each of the five elements matched closely enough by the sum of perturbations from these events .",

    "we offer one example of a greater than average difficulty to outline the issues involved and to illustrate the plausibility of our swarm s fragmentation hypothesis .",
    "the first issues are whether in our scenario we should ( a ) presume more than one original parent and ( b ) consider more than a single orbit about the sun .",
    "the answer is no on both counts .",
    "one , the lifetimes of all soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers observed to disintegrate just before perihelion are shorter than one revolution , as otherwise these objects would have disintegrated just before their previous perihelion passage and could not be seen nowadays .",
    "and two , even if fragmentation began before previous perihelion , the secondary parents , which would have to have been large enough objects to survive , and their own subsequently generated swarms would be separated from each other by such huge gaps in time that their association could not easily be recognized .",
    "thus , our task is indeed confined to one parent and a single revolution about the sun .    with these constraints in mind , let us consider the first entry in table  2 , c/2006  a5 .",
    "its orbital elements suggest that it was a member of the tightly - knit swarm .",
    "because it preceded soho-2143 ( a proxy for the parent ) by as much as 5.74 years , it represents a highly challenging case . in concert with our objectives",
    ", we ask :  could the early arrival of c/2006  a5 and the deviation of its orbital elements from those of soho-2143 be explained by perturbations due to separation velocities acquired in a sequence of fragmentation events ?    in our scenario ,",
    "the difference of almost 6 years is an _ integrated _ perturbation of the arrival time at next perihelion , that is , the sum of perturbations at @xmath38 fragmentation events in which this sungrazer was involved either as part of a larger object in each of the first @xmath39 events or as a stand - alone fragment produced by the last , @xmath38-th event .    to estimate the number of fragmentation events",
    ", we use a simple model , with the magnitude at maximum light ( normalized , strictly , to 1  au from earth , but differing very little from the apparent magnitude in close proximity of the sun ) as a proxy for the initial mass , since both quantities were shown to have been tightly correlated ( sekanina 2003 ) . for c/2006",
    "a5 the magnitude at maximum light was 2.9 ( table 1 ) ; for the parent we approximate the lower limit to its peak brightness by that of soho-2143 , that is , by magnitude @xmath40.5 .",
    "the upper limit to the peak brightness of the original parent is uncertain .",
    "the object may have been as bright as magnitude @xmath42.0 ( see above ) or even brighter ; we adopt , rather arbitrarily , magnitude @xmath42.5 .",
    "if the parent and its fragments are assumed to have split , in each step of the process , into two parts of equal mass ( 50 percent of their immediate parent s mass ) , the mass of any fragment after @xmath38 events is a part of the original parent . because the estimated mass of c/2006  a5 comes out on our assumptions to be between and times smaller than the original parent s mass , we obtain a condition .",
    "to the extent that this scenario applies , c/2006  a5 should have been involved in  fragmentation events during the 900 years , not counting the initial breakup of x/1106  c1 near perihelion .    in our example , we deem c/2006 a5 a final product of six fragmentation events and require that the magnitude of the separation velocity acquired by it during each event not exceed 1  m  s@xmath17 .",
    "since this sungrazer preceded soho-2143 , the parent s proxy , the radial component , which dominates the perturbations of the arrival time at next perihelion , must have been directed toward the sun .",
    "we also require , rather arbitrarily , that the separation velocity vector not vary from event to event and that the last event have occurred at aphelion . with these constraints ,",
    "all that needs to be chosen in table  7 ( or its expanded version ) is six entries such that their sum is greater in absolute value than 5.74  years .",
    "one of many solutions that fits well the differences between the orbital elements of c/2006  a5 and soho-2143 in table  2 is presented in table  10 .",
    "the choice of orbital locations for the fragmentation events is , in the absence of conditions constraining the fragment s history , rather arbitrary . whether the fragmentation events were a corollary of major thermal stresses that continued to ravage the body s interior after perihelion ( sekanina & chodas 2012 ) or more or less spontaneous",
    ", the example in table  10 conforms to an expectation that they became gradually less frequent and eventually ceased .",
    "other scenarios are of course possible , but , as seen from table  7 , postaphelion fragmentation fits only differences of @xmath211 year or so in the arrival times at next perihelion , unless @xmath40ms@xmath17 or the number of fragmentation events is extraordinarily large .",
    "the separation velocity that fits the fragmentation sequence in table  10 is 0.96  m  s@xmath17 per event , with the components , , and , all in m  s@xmath17 .",
    "the perfect agreement between the perturbation sum and the orbital difference is to be expected for the arrival time and the perihelion distance , because the perturbations of these elements are dominated by a single component of the separation velocity , the radial and the transverse one , respectively .",
    "the agreement between the perturbation sums and the orbital differences in the three angular elements is another matter , because the perturbations of all three are dominated by the normal component of the separation velocity .",
    "also , when the radial and transverse components exceed in magnitude the normal component , the contributions from the transverse velocity to the arrival - time perturbation and from the normal component to the perihelion - distance perturbation are not entirely negligible and they impact the balance of the result .",
    "the residuals in table  10 of about 0@xmath15.1 in each of the three angular elements suggest that they are within the errors of observation , thus acceding to the plausibility of our perturbation scenario and to the status of the bright dwarf sungrazers in the swarm as fragments of a common parent , sharing orbits very similar to that of comet c/1843  d1 and being closely related to this spectacular object . in the light of this compelling evidence ,",
    "the remarkable coincidence in timing between the arrival of the swarm and the appearance of comet c/2011  w3 is found to be purely fortuitous .    the clump of nearly two dozen faint soho / stereo kreutz minicomets from mid - december 2010 is shown to be a debris of the swarm s another member that fragmented far from the sun on its way to perihelion . for the clump s duration of about eight days , table  7 suggests that the parent s fragmentation most probably began more recently than some 150 years ago and less than @xmath0130  au from the sun after aphelion .",
    "when orbits of all soho / stereo sungrazers from 2011 are available , the origin of the second major clump , from december of that year , can likewise be examined .",
    "the situation with the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers is reminiscent of that with the temporal distribution of the solar maximum mission ( smm ) sungrazers , whose orbits were studied extensively by marsden ( 1989 ) .",
    "he found that , like the swarm members in our investigation , the objects belonged to what he called _",
    "subgroup  i _ , which includes c/1843  d1 , and that two pairs of them arrived only 1213 days apart .",
    "although the smm sungrazers orbits were determined less accurately than those of the brighter soho / stereo sungrazers , a general tendency is apparent among the smm objects orbits ( marsden 1989 , marsden & williams 2008 ) for the argument of perihelion and the longitude of the ascending node to systematically increase with time in the course of that `` swarm s '' observed duration of about two years .    the experience with the 2010/2011 swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers and comet",
    "c/2011  w3 shows that it is _ not advisable to employ suddenly increasing rates of soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers _ , especially the brighter ones , _ as a token of an imminent _ ( on a time scale of a year or so ) _ arrival of a spectacular member of the kreutz system_. although it would have worked , because of a coincidence , in the case of c/2011  w3 , a prediction of this kind  with no further supporting evidence  is in fact merely a product of wishful thinking and very risky .",
    "it appears that the process of cascading fragmentation , whose influence on the evolution of comets in general and of the kreutz system in particular proves overwhelming , makes it virtually impossible to predict the arrival of a spectacular sungrazer on time scales of a year or so .    in evolutionary terms",
    ", the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers provides useful information toward our understanding the kreutz system s morphology , just as does c/2011  w3 .",
    "they both represent _ warning signals _ that the expected new , 21st - century cluster of spectacular members of the kreutz system is approaching . even though the swarm and c/2011  w3 are products of different evolutionary paths , the orbital periods",
    " directly computed for c/2011  w3 and indirectly inferred for the swarm  consistently show that the 20th - century cluster , which was observed to extend from 1945 to 1970 , did not represent the last `` bead '' of the `` string of pearls '' [ to euphemistically express the extent of the protofragment s perihelion breakup in analogy to the appearance of comet d/1993",
    "f2 ( shoemaker - levy ) ] , but that one or more `` beads '' are yet to come .",
    "the alert to the expected new cluster is the only parallel link that we find in our effort to decode the meaning of the two remarkable , nearly - simultaneous events .",
    "our study of the population of soho / stereo s kreutz sungrazers and their rate of arrival in the years 20042013 offers the following conclusions on the kreutz system and on the potential temporal relationship with comet c/2011",
    "w3 :    \\(1 ) in addition to its usual annual periodicity , caused by selection effects , the overall arrival - time distribution displays a number of prominent spikes , whose magnitude peaked approximately one year before the appearance of comet c/2011 w3 , in december 2010 .",
    "\\(2 ) comet c/2011 w3 arrived also about one year after the sharply elevated arrival rate of the soho / stereo sungrazers brighter at maximum light than apparent magnitude  3 , which are free from major selection effects . a polynomial fitted through a set of 19 objects of this swarm showed a peak rate of 4.6 per year centered on 2010.88 , while a similar polynomial fitted to a subset of 13 sungrazers brighter at maximum light than apparent magnitude  2 indicated a peak rate of 4.3 per year centered on 2011.35 , compared with a pre-2006 average rate of @xmath01 per year",
    "the estimated uncertainty in the times of peak arrival rate is a few months .",
    "\\(3 ) a potential physical correlation between comet c/2011",
    "w3 and the elevated rate of the distribution of bright soho / stereo sungrazers is strongly contradicted by dynamical evidence , which shows no orbital similarity between these bright objects and c/2011 w3 , with deviations of 10@xmath1 or more in each of the three angular elements .",
    "\\(4 ) on the other hand , fully 18 of the 19 bright soho / stereo sungrazers were found to move in orbits very similar to that of the spectacular kreutz comet c/1843  d1 , and 16 of them made up a swarm of tightly related objects , with clear systematic trends in the argument of perihelion , the longitude of the ascending node , and the perihelion distance .",
    "\\(5 ) the cumulative distribution of soho / stereo sungrazers arrivals exhibits a series of flat segments or `` flats , '' relatively prolonged intervals of time ( 35 weeks ) during which the arrival rate of the population of kreutz minicomets was nil or extremely low ( gaps ) ; they do not correlate well with the instances of soho s roll .",
    "\\(6 ) the temporal distribution of the flats is strongly nonuniform : no flat is located from the beginning of 2004 to mid-2006 , while their rate is the highest and equal to 3 per year between mid-2006 and mid-2008 ; from mid-2009 to mid-2011 the rate is nearly constant at 2 per year .",
    "\\(7 ) the number of flats appears to correlate with the arrival rate of soho / stereo sungrazers brighter at maximum light than magnitude 3 ; this correlation appears counterintuitive in that there are no flats in a segment of the distribution curve that is not populated by any bright dwarf sungrazer while the temporal rate of flats peaks in a segment of the curve that is marked by the arrivals of three such sungrazers .",
    "\\(8 ) this peculiar property is understood in the framework of cascading fragmentation , as gaps in the temporal distribution of subfragments are byproducts of relatively more sizable and cohesive parent fragments ; their breakup generally leads to more nonuniform , cluster - like temporal arrangement of the ensuing subfragments .",
    "\\(9 ) overall , the results of this study vividly illustrate the immense morphological complexity of the kreutz system . in connection with c/2011",
    "w3 they not only show that no bright soho / stereo sungrazer was moving in a similar orbit at least between 2004 and the end of 2012 , but that even faint kreutz minicomets in such orbits were very rare , a few close short - lived companions accompanying the comet notwithstanding .",
    "\\(10 ) as a plausible interpretation of the evidence , we propose that another lovejoy - sized sungrazer , moving in an orbit similar to that of c/1843  d1 but with the perihelion time close to that of c/2011 w3 , continued to break up at large heliocentric distances ; and that the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers with their arrival rate peaking some time in late 2010 or early 2011 was the prime product of this fragmentation process .",
    "\\(11 ) the prominently spike - like distribution of fainter soho / stereo minicomets suggests that it contains a debris of prematurely fragmented bright dwarf sungrazers also belonging to the swarm .",
    "this scenario is shown to apply to the most prominent clump of 22 faint soho / stereo sungrazers from mid - december 2010 , up to 19 of which fit a test of their association with the swarm .",
    "this correlation should also be verified on another clump of faint sungrazers from december 2011 , when their orbital data become available .",
    "\\(12 ) a decisive role of sheer chance in the timing of the appearance of comet c/2011  w3 , on the one hand , and of the significantly elevated arrival rate of the population of soho / stereo kreutz minicomets and especially the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers , on the other hand , is under the circumstances indisputable .",
    "\\(13 ) a common origin of all 16 members of the tightly - knit swarm is understood in terms of perturbations during their original parent s fragmentation , which proceeded in a cascading fashion at large heliocentric distances .",
    "this scenario is strongly corroborated by comparison of systematic trends in the swarm members orbital elements with the perturbations expected to be caused by separation velocities acquired by the fragments during such breakup events .",
    "\\(14 ) spikes in , and sharply elevated rates of , the temporal distribution of soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers , bright and faint alike , should not be mistaken for a token of an imminent ( on a time scale of a year or so ) arrival of a spectacular member of the kreutz system . because of an overwhelming effect of cascading fragmentation , it is practically impossible to predict the arrival of a major kreutz sungrazer on such short time scales .",
    "\\(15 ) the swarm of bright dwarf sungrazers and the clumps of fainter sungrazers , causing prominent spikes in the soho / stereo arrival - time distribution , represent another warning signal that the expected 21st - century cluster of spectacular kreutz comets  is  on its way to perihelion , to arrive in the coming decades ( sekanina & chodas 2012 ) .",

    "<S> selection effects , influencing the observed distribution , are largely absent among bright dwarf sungrazers , whose temporal sequence implies the presence  of  a swarm , with the objects brighter at maximum than apparent magnitude  3 arriving at a peak  rate  of @xmath04.6 per year in late 2010 , while those brighter than magnitude 2 at a peak rate of @xmath04.3 per year in early 2011 , both a few times the pre - swarm rate . </S>",
    "<S> the entire population of soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers also peaked about one year before the appearance of c/2011  w3 . </S>",
    "<S> orbital data show , however , that a great majority of bright dwarf sungrazers moved in paths similar to that of comet c/1843  d1 , deviating 10@xmath1 or more from the orbit of c/2011  w3 in the angular  elements . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence from the swarm and the overall elevated arrival rates suggests the existence of a fragmented sizable sungrazer that shortly preceded c/2011  w3 but was independent of it . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> these findings represent another _ warning signal _ that the expected 21st - century cluster of spectacular kreutz comets is on its way to perihelion , to arrive during the coming decades . </S>",
    "<S> it is only in this sense that we find a parallel link between c/2011  w3 and the spikes in the population of soho / stereo kreutz sungrazers . </S>"
