    "the investigation of nucleon ( hadron ) composite structure is still the most important subjects of hadron physics . from the experimental point of view ,",
    "one of the wide - spread and useful instruments for such studies is the single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) .",
    "especially , the single transverse spin asymmetry opens the access to the three - dimensional nucleon structure thanks for the non - trivial connection between the transverse spin and the parton transverse momentum dependence ( see , for example , @xcite )    in qcd , the ssa related to the drell - yan ( dy ) process was first considered in the case of the longitudinally polarized hadron @xcite .",
    "this ssa is especially interesting provided the second hadron is a pion .",
    "this is because of the sensitivity @xcite to the shape of pion distribution amplitude , being currently the object of major interest @xcite ( see also @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it was shown that the imaginary phase in the ssa which is associated with the longitudinally polarized nucleon appear due to either the hard perturbative gluon loops @xcite or twist four contribution of the pion distribution amplitude @xcite .",
    "for the single transverse spin asymmetry in the transverse - polarized dy process , the imaginary part has previously been extracted from the quark propagator in the so - called standard , see fig .",
    "[ fig - dy ] the left panel , diagram with quark - gluon twist three correlator only ( it leads to the gluon pole contribution to ssa , see @xcite ) .",
    "the reason was that the ambiguity in the boundary conditions provide the purely real quark - gluon function @xmath0 which parameterizes @xmath1 matrix element . on the other hand ,",
    "the real @xmath0-function kills the contribution from the non - standard , see fig .",
    "[ fig - dy ] the right panel , diagram which however is absolutely necessary to ensure the qed gauge invariance of the dy hadron tensor .",
    "this situation has been discussed in detail in series of papers @xcite where , with the help of the contour gauge conception , the twist three @xmath0-function has been proven to be in fact the complex function . in its turn , this leads to the non - zero contribution from the non - standard diagram which produces the imaginary phase required to have the ssa .",
    "this additional contribution also leads to an extra factor of @xmath2 for ssa .",
    "recently , the problem of the spurious singularity fixing in the ( local ) axial gauge has attracted an attention again ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    the light - cone axial gauge condition imposed on non - abelian gluon field , @xmath3 , naturally enables the parton number ( probability ) interpretation of parton density functions in the tree level @xcite . however , perturbative calculations beyond the tree approximation demand careful treatment of the so - called spurious uncertainties in the gluon propagator @xmath4 in the light - cone gauge @xcite .",
    "the latter arise as ill - defined pole singularities of the form @xmath5 and are associated , putting the same issue a bit different , with the residual gauge freedom due to incomplete gauge fixing by @xmath3 . for this reason calculations in the axial ( light - cone ) gauge in higher perturbative orders are cumbersome and sometimes even contradictory @xcite .",
    "one can attempt to overcome this difficulty by working in the well - defined general covariant gauge setting the gauge parameter to @xmath6 , which is known to effectively ` imitate ' non - covariant gauges @xcite .",
    "another approach is to keep working in the light - cone gauge and to get rid of the residual gauge freedom by an appropriate extra gauge - fixing condition .",
    "the latter can be obtained in terms of the various boundary conditions for the gluon fields and/or their spatial derivatives @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate an alternative approach to formulation of the more general gauge - fixing condition from the very beginning which is supposed to entail the `` right '' pole prescriptions for the gluon propagator .",
    "we continue to explore the contour gauge conception and demonstrate how the spurious uncertainties in the gluon propagator can ultimately be fixed in the non - local axial gauges .",
    "working within the collinear factorization procedure , we emphasize the substantial role of the non - standard diagram to get the relevant contour in the wilson path - ordered exponential needed to fix ultimately the spurious singularity in the gluon propagator .",
    "we begin with the kinematics of drell - yan process . as in @xcite",
    ", we study the drell - yan process with the transversely polarized hadron : @xmath7 where the virtual photon producing the lepton pair ( @xmath8 ) has a large mass squared ( @xmath9 ) while the transverse momenta are small and integrated out .",
    "this kinematics ( anticipating the collinear factorization procedure ) suggests a convenient frame with fixed dominant light - cone directions @xcite : @xmath10 it is also instructive to introduce the dimensionful analogs of @xmath11 as @xmath12 with the above vectors as a basis , an arbitrary vector can be ( sudakov ) decomposed as @xmath13 in what follows we will not be so precise about writing the covariant and contravariant vectors in any kinds of summations over the four - dimensional vectors , except the cases where this trick may lead to misunderstanding .",
    "the polarized dy process is very convenient process to study the role of twist three by exploring of different kinds of ssas .",
    "for example , one can study the left - right asymmetry which means the transverse momenta of the leptons are correlated with the direction @xmath14 where @xmath15 implies the transverse polarization vector of the nucleon and @xmath16 is a beam direction @xcite .    generally speaking ,",
    "any single spin asymmetries can be presented in the symbolical form as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an unpolarized leptonic tensor and @xmath19 stands for the hadronic tensor . at the moment",
    ", we do not specify the phase space in eqn .",
    "( [ ssa - a ] ) because the exact expression for ssa is irrelevant for our discussion . instead",
    ", we mainly pay our attention on the hadron tensor which can be presented as @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the strong interaction coupling constant and @xmath22 the hadron tensor representations can be found below . in our case ,",
    "the single transverse spin asymmetry is only generated by the hadron tensors @xmath23 and @xmath24 where the twist three contributions related to @xmath1 have been extracted .",
    "as shown below , the @xmath25-correlators in the hadron tensors @xmath26 participate in forming of the corresponding wilson lines which appear in the quark - antiquark correlators of the hadron tensor @xmath27 . in the frame of usual axial gauge ( @xmath3 ) , this kind of contributions can be discarded .",
    "however , we work in the contour gauge which is , first , a non - local generalization of the well - know axial gauge .",
    "second , the contour gauge contains the important and unique additional information ( needed to fix the prescription in the gluon poles ) which is invisible in the case of usual ( local ) axial gauge . from this point of view , before we discard the terms with @xmath28 , we have to determine the relevant fixed path in the restored wilson line with @xmath28 which eventually leads to the certain prescriptions in the gluon poles ( for further explanations , see @xcite ) .      in this section ,",
    "we analyse the part of the dy hadron tensor which is generated by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig - dy ] , the left panel .",

    "we now analyze the tensor structure of the trace in eqn .",

    "we can see that the first term of the quark propagator , @xmath35 , singles out only the transverse components of gluon field in the quark - gluon correlator , see eqn .",

    "it is necessary to notice that in the dy process case the corresponding @xmath43-functions appeared in the hadron tensor and expressed the momentum conservation law should be also referred to the hard parts .",
