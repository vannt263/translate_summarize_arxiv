    "presence of interstellar dust towards the formation of complex interstellar molecules is taken for granted especially after the discovery of more than twenty molecules around the star forming region in the interstellar ice . altogether , according to the cdms catalog ( http://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/cdms/molecules ) , one hundred and seventy molecules have been detected in the interstellar medium or circumstellar shells . to model the formation of complex molecules , and especially through interstellar grain chemistry ,",
    "several attempts were made by various workers ( chakrabarti et al .",
    ", 2006ab ; das et al . , 2008b ; das , acharyya & chakrabarti 2010 ; cuppen et al . , 2007 ;",
    "cuppen et al . , 2009 etc .",
    ") over the years .",
    "interstellar dust grains are thought to be consisting of amorphous silicate or carbonaceous core surrounded by molecular ice layer ( draine et al . , 2003 ; gibb et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "it has been clear from the experimental and observational results that almost 90@xmath1 of the grain mantle is covered with h@xmath2o , ch@xmath3oh , co@xmath2 ( keane et al . , 2001 , das et al . , 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "presence of hcn , cn , cs and h@xmath2o in space were identified by anomalous absorption ( omont 1993 & bujarrabal et al . ,",
    "1994 ) . but",
    "a complete understanding of the chemical and physical processes which take place on a grain surface is still missing .",
    "the origin of amino acids through the pre - biotic chemistry of the early earth has been a topic of long standing interest .",
    "however , complex pre - biotic molecules might also be formed due to very complex and rich chemical processes inside a molecular cloud .",
    "the production of amino acids , nucleobases , carbohydrates and other basic compounds can possibly start from the molecules like hcn , cyno compounds , aldehyde , and ketones ( orgel 2004 ; abelson 1966 ) , which could lead to the origin of life in the primitive earth conditions .",
    "however , even with the present observational tools , it is hard to confirm the presence of any bio - molecules in the ism .",
    "so it may suffice , if we can identify a few precursor molecules which eventually form bio - molecules in the interstellar space .",
    "quantum chemical simulations could be used to find out the spectral properties of these complex molecules .",
    "it is observed and experimentally verified that the spectral signature of a species significantly deviates between the gas phase and the ice phase .",
    "so a theoretical study of the spectral properties of the precursors of some important bio - molecules in both the gas and ice phases could serve as benchmarks for the observations .    in this paper , we consider a large gas - grain network coupled with a hydrodynamic simulation to obtain the abundances of various complex molecules , which could lead to the formations of adenine , alanine & glycine .",
    "we also discuss the production of formamide which is an important precursor in the process of the abiotic synthesis of amino acids . in the literature , there are several observational studies on glycine ( kuan et al . , 2003 ,",
    "hollis et al .",
    "2003 , snyder et al .",
    "2005 , etc . ) .",
    "but its existence in a molecular cloud , till date , is not verified without a reasonable doubt . in case of adenine",
    ", we find that though its abundance in our theoretical model is well under the observation limit , its precursor molecules are heavily abundant .",
    "it is also true for the alanine and glycine .",
    "these prompted us to find out the spectral signatures of the precursor molecules of these three molecules around the different astrophysical environment , from which one could roughly anticipate the abundances of adenine , glycine & alanine .",
    "all possible reaction pathways are included in the gas as well as in the grain phase network .",
    "armed with the chemical abundances of these precursor molecules , we compute the infrared and electronic absorption spectra in the gas as well as for the icy grains .    the plan of this paper is the following . in section 2 , the models used and the computational details are presented .",
    "implications of the results are discussed in section 3 . finally , in section 4 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the process of formation of complex molecules in the interstellar space is very much uncertain .",
    "there could be a number of pathways available for the formation of a complex molecule .",
    "however , depending on the chemical abundances of the reactive species and the reaction cross section , the rate of formation varies .",
    "formation routes of several interstellar bio - molecules are already reported in majumdar et al . , ( 2012 ) .",
    "they pointed out that despite of the huge abundances of the neutral species , radical - molecular / radical - radical reaction pathways dominates towards the formation of some pre - biotic species .",
    "normally such reactions are barrier less and exothermic in nature . to study the chemical evolution of various complex radicals , ions , molecules which are very much important for the prebiotic synthesis of different bases of amino acids , we have constructed a hydro - chemical model to mimic the interstellar scenario .",
    "the evolution of the chemical species is strongly dependent on the physical properties of the medium .",
    "so the dynamic nature of the medium at any particular instant could influence the chemical composition of the medium .",
    "das et al . , ( 2008b ) & das et al . , ( 2010 ) considered a spherically symmetric isothermal ( 10k ) collapsing cloud , whose outer boundary was assumed to be located at one parsec and the inner boundary was assume to be located at 10@xmath4 parsec .",
    "they used a finite difference eulerian scheme ( upwind scheme ) to solve the eulerian equations of hydrodynamics in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "since they were interested in the spherical case , they only considered radial motion and ignored any dependency upon the @xmath5 & @xmath6 coordinates . by solving the hydrodynamic equations they studied fully time - dependent behaviour of the spherical flow .    to have a realistic condition ,",
    "we have considered this density distribution as an input for our chemical model .",
    "the gas phase chemical network is mainly adopted from the umist 2006 database ( woodall et al . , 2007 ) . here",
    ", we have chosen the initial elemental abundances according to the woodall et al . , ( 2007 ) , these are the typical low - metal abundances often adopted for tmc-1 cloud .",
    "we add a few new reactions following chakrabarti et al .",
    ", ( 2000ab ) , woon et al . , ( 2002 ) , quan & herbst ( 2007 ) , gupta et al . , ( 2011 ) and references therein . recently ,",
    "majumdar et al . , ( 2012 ) , calculated the rate coefficients for the reaction pathways described in chakrabarti et al . , 2000ab .",
    "they used bates ( 1983 ) semi - empirical formula to find out the rate coefficients of any chemical reactions .",
    "gupta et al.(2011 ) also followed the same prescription to find out the reaction rates for the adenine formation in interstellar space .    to show the importance of grains towards the chemical enrichment of the ism",
    ", we have also included a detailed grain chemistry network following hasegawa , herbst & leung ( 1992 ) , das et al . , ( 2008a ) , das et al . , ( 2010 ) , cuppen et al . , ( 2007 ) , jones et al . , ( 2011 ) , garrod et al . , ( 2008 ) and das & chakrabarti ( 2011 ) into our reaction network .",
    "we therefore have the most updated chemical network to study the chemical evolution of several interstellar species . in order to perform a self - consistent study",
    ", we assume that the gas and the grains are coupled through the accretion and the thermal evaporation processes .",
    "we assume that the species are physisorbed onto the dust grain ( classical size grain @xmath7 1000 a@xmath8 ) having the grain number density @xmath9n , where @xmath10 is the concentration of h nuclei in all forms .",
    "thus , in principle , we have a complete interstellar model , which could be used to follow the hydro - chemical properties of a collapsing cloud .",
    "first of all , we have optimized the geometry of the molecules , which are the precursors of various bio - molecules in space . in order to have an idea for the stability of these molecules , b3lyp/6 - 311++g",
    "* * level is used . gas phase vibrational frequencies of these precursor molecules are also calculated by the b3lyp/6 - 311++g * * level . *",
    "observational evidences suggest that grain mantles around the dense clouds are mainly covered by h@xmath2o ( @xmath11% ) , ch@xmath3oh ( 2 - 30% with respect to solid water ) and co@xmath2 ( 2 - 20 % with respect to solid water ) . to find out the effects of the solvent on the spectrum , we have chosen three types of ice .",
    "( i ) unless otherwise stated , we use pure water ice .",
    "( ii ) we use methanol ice also to mimic the ice composition around the methanol rich environment and finally , ( iii ) based on the observational results , we construct an ice , which consists of 70% water 20% methanol and 10% carbon - di oxide and call is as the ` mixed ice ' . *    in order to find out the vibrational frequencies of these molecules in the ice phase , we have optimized the geometry of these molecules in ice at b3lyp/6 - 311++g * * level . here , the polarizable continuum model ( pcm ) model is used with the integral equation formalism variant ( iefpcm ) as the default scrf method .",
    "we have chosen iefpcm model as a convenient one , since the second energy derivative is available for this model and also it is analytic in nature .",
    "vibrational frequencies given here are not exactly for the ice phase since the dielectric constant of ice ( @xmath12 ) is slightly higher than that of water ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we have calculated also the electronic absorption spectrum of these molecules using the time dependent density functional theory ( tddft study ) .",
    "till date , due to the constraints on the observational sensitivity , it is quite challenging to directly identify interstellar bio - molecules .",
    "for instance , the observational report on glycine by kuan et al . , ( 2003 ) was not supported by hollis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and snyder et al .",
    "chemical models ( chakrabarti & chakrabarti 2000ab , das et al . , 2008b , majumdar et al . ,",
    "2012 ) predict that the trace amount of bio - molecules could be produced during the collapsing phase of a proto - star .",
    "since the abundances of these molecules are very low , it is possible that they are not directly observable with the present day technology .",
    "however , if we concentrate on the pathways through which these molecules form in the ism and identify the precursor molecules , it could be much easier to predict their abundances .",
    "this is what is done in our work .",
    "we compute their chemical abundances after considering the gas - grain interaction in our chemical model and present the spectral signatures of the precursor molecules in the gas phase as well as in the grain phase .",
    "water is found to be the most abundant molecule followed by methanol and carbon - di - oxide in the ice phase .",
    "we have concentrated on the changes of the spectral signature between the gas phase and ice phase .",
    "the spectral changes with the changes of solvents are also highlighted .",
    "there are a few studies related to the formation of adenine .",
    "chakrabarti et al . , ( 2000ab ) proposed a neutral - neutral pathways for the formation of adenine . according to them",
    ", the adenine could be produced by the following reactions : @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 recently gupta et al .",
    "( 2011 ) proposed that the following radical - molecular reaction network , which could lead to the adenine formation.*@xmath17",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 * in the chemical model described in majumdar et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the reactions 1 to 11 were included and it was concluded that the production of adenine is dominated by the radical - molecular reaction pathways .",
    "hccn and nh@xmath2cn are the two important molecules , which are responsible for the production of adenine by the radical - molecular pathways .",
    "so we could treat hccn and nh@xmath2cn as the precursor molecules for the production of interstellar adenine .",
    "hccn is highly abundant in the interstellar space ( jiurys et al . , 2006 ,",
    "guelin & cernicharo 1991 ) .",
    "the formation of hccn on the grain was considered by hasegawa , herbst & leung ( 1992 ) .",
    "mcgonagle & irvine ( 1996 ) conducted a deep search for hccn towards tmc-1 and several gmc s via its n(j)=1(2)@xmath240(1 ) transition .",
    "they set an upper limit of fractional abundance with respect to molecular hydrogen of 2 @xmath25 .",
    "the existence of nh@xmath2cn in the interstellar cloud was first reported by turner et al .",
    "after that it was observed in both diffuse and dense clouds by liszt & lucas ( 2001 ) .",
    "woodall ( 2007 ) predicted a steady state fractional abundance of 2.02@xmath25 for nh@xmath2cn with respect to h@xmath2 .",
    "cn in gas as well as in h@xmath2o ice .",
    "the line strength in the ice phase is generally several times higher.,width=377,height=377 ]    we already mentioned that we are using the density distribution of our hydrodynamical model as an input of our chemical model . since production of complex species in the intermediate region of the cloud is favourable , we consider the density distribution of intermediate region as an input of our chemical model . in fig . 1 , we present the chemical evolution of adenine in gas phase along with its two precursor molecules , namely , hccn & nh@xmath2cn . we find that the abundance of nh@xmath2cn is significantly higher , having a peak abundance of 1.7 @xmath26 and a final abundance of nh@xmath2cn ( after @xmath7 5 @xmath27 years ) is 1.38@xmath28 with respect to total hydrogen nuclei . * in our case , final abundance of nh@xmath2cn appears to be slightly lower than the amount calculated by woodall et al . , ( 2007 ) .",
    "this is probably because woodall et al . , (",
    "2007 ) carried out their simulation by assuming a constant density cloud ( 10@xmath29 @xmath30 ) , whereas in our case , we consider a realistic density distribution obtained from the isothermal hydrodynamic model .",
    "moreover , our chemical network consists of a large gas - grain network whereas the grain - surface network is missing in woodall et al . , ( 2007 ) .",
    "* peak value of the hccn abundance is found to be 4.1 @xmath31 and finally it turns out to be 1.14@xmath32 .",
    "with these two significantly abundant molecules , adenine could be produced with an abundance of 4.4 @xmath33 . in our hydrodynamic model ,",
    "density around the inner grid locations started to increase rapidly after 10@xmath34 years .",
    "the reason behind this is that after one dynamical time scale ( @xmath7 free fall time @xmath7 10@xmath34 years ) , there are the smooth transport of matter from the outer envelope to the inner envelope .",
    "after some dynamical times ( i.e. , around 10@xmath35 years ) , core mass gets heavier and induce more matter from the cloud than the matter actually accreting to the cloud through the outer envelope .",
    "finally , the cloud relaxes to a steady state density distribution . since there was a sharp rise in density between 10@xmath34 - 10@xmath35 years for our hydrodynamical model , our chemical evolution also shows ( fig .",
    "1 ) sharp rise in the abundances during that period . since we chose the initial elemental abundances following woodall et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , basically , we started with zero abundance of any complex species .",

    "it has nine fundamental vibrations ( rubalcava , 1956 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , infrared absorption spectra of nh@xmath2cn for the gas phase and ice phase is shown .",

    "recently sivaraman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , performed an experiment to obtain the ir spectra of the formamide in the ice phase .",
    "they used experimental setup based at the open university , uk ( sivaraman et al . , 2008 ) to simulate astrochemical ices and their irradiation environments .",
    "the instrument was operated at base pressure of the order of @xmath90torr , and it could go down up to the temperature 28k .",
    "low temperature was achieved by using a closed cycle helium cryostat .",
    "a caf@xmath2 substrate was placed at the end of the cryostat onto which the molecular gases were directly deposited to form multilayer targets .",
    "sample temperature measurements were carried out using a silicon ( si ) diode sensor calibrated using the calibration curve provided by the scientific instruments .",
    "formamide samples 99.5 % pure ( from sigma aldrich ) , were used . before introducing the formamide vapour into the chamber ,",
    "the liquid sample was processed by three freeze - pump - thaw cycles to degas any absorbed impurities .",
    "the sample was then allowed to return to room temperature before extracting the vapours to form the ice on the caf@xmath2 substrate",
    ".    0.6 cm    we compare our theoretical result with this recent experiment .",
    "figure 7 shows the normalized infrared spectra of formamide molecule in the ice phase ( where h@xmath2o was used as a solvent ) which we calculate along with the experimentally obtained infrared spectra of formamide at 30k before irradiation .",
    "peak positions are given in table 3 .",
    "it is clear from table 3 that some of the calculated peaks are very close to the experimental values .",
    "for example , our calculated peak position is at 1387.40 @xmath36 , whereas the experimentally obtained peak location is at 1386 @xmath36 . beside this",
    ", there are a few more peaks which are close to the experimental values ( table 3 ) . * to have an idea about the effect of solvent upon the spectrum",
    ", we considered different kind of ice as a solvent .",
    "in general , we have considered the water ice but depending upon the properties around the molecular cloud , ice composition may be different ( das et al . ,",
    "2010 ) . keeping this",
    ", first we consider pure methanol ice instead of pure water ice and study the changes in the peak positions and intensities ( table 3 ) .",
    "second , based on the observational results , we consider a mixed ice , which consists of 70% water , 20% methanol and 10% co@xmath2 molecules and noted down the spectral properties in table 3 . from table 3 , it is evident that the peak positions of formamide in methanol containing ice and mixed ice are slightly shifted in compare to the formamide in pure water ice .",
    "* though some peak positions are closely coinciding with our theoretical calculations , some observed peaks are well above our values .",
    "our quantum chemical calculations are based upon the ab initio methods in gaussian 09 , which employ the born - openhiemer approximation in generating the energy expressions .",
    "it then allows us to separate the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the energy is the electronic energy parameterized by the frozen locations of the nuclei and because they are frozen , the model simulates at 0k , whereas the experiment was performed at 30k .",
    "moreover , here we are not considering the clusters of formamide for calculating the spectra .",
    "rather , we are including one formamide molecule in a spherical cavity , which is immersed in a continuous medium with a dielectric constant . here",
    "the solute - solvent electrostatic interactions are treated at the dipole level .",
    "the solvent effect brings significant changes in the geometrical parameters of formamide .",
    "our model confirms that the polarization of the solute by the continuum has important effects on the absolute and relative solvation energies , which , in turn , shift the frequency and vary the intensity in the infrared mode . on the other hand , during the experiment , several clusters could be formed .",
    "so , an ideal match is not expected .",
    "electronic absorption spectral parameters of formamide molecule in gas phase as well as in the ice phase are highlighted in table 4 .",
    "an electronic absorption spectrum of formamide molecule in gas phase is characterized by 3 intense peaks .",
    "these three transitions occurred at 163.4 , 100.1 , 92.0 nm with major contributions from h-1@xmath24 l+1 , h-3@xmath24 l+5 , h-0@xmath24 l+16 transitions respectively . with these strong peaks ,",
    "some substructures are also prominent in the gas phase , which are completely absent in the ice phase . as in the other cases , these intense peaks are due to the transition from homo to lumo ( table 4 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the infrared and electronic absorption spectra of various complex molecules , which could be treated as the precursors of adenine , glycine and alanine in several astronomical situations . * since we use a realistic scenario with hydro - chemical evolutions with accurate rate coefficients ( majumdar et al .",
    "2012 ) our results could be significant for future observations . *    in comparison with the gas phase spectra , the spectral properties in the ice phase are significantly different .",
    "various peak positions are shifted and some peaks completely disappeared .",
    "some substructures became pronounced also in the ice phase .",
    "* based on the observational results , we simulated our grain mantle differently which have different ice compositions .",
    "we considered the ice to be that of pure water or pure methanol or even mixed ( 70% water 20% methanol and 10% co@xmath2 ) in nature .",
    "we have highlighted the dependence of the spectral changes on the solvent types *    we computed the chemical evolution of adenine , alanine & glycine along with their precursor molecules .",
    "we pointed out that the computed abundances of the precursor molecules are within the observational limits and could be detected in future .",
    "based on the abundances of these precursor molecules , one could estimate the abundances of the molecules of our interest .",
    "we made a comparison between our calculated infrared spectra of formamide and experimentally obtained infrared spectra .",
    "some of the peak locations are found to coincide while a few others do not match .",
    "we presented possible reasons behind this .",
    "there are ample debates on whether alanine , glycine or adenine has been seen in interstellar medium or not , it is possible that the abundances of these molecules are very small and the present day equipments lack sufficient sensitivities .",
    "however , our paper probes the feasibility of observing the precursors of these very important molecules and computed abundances seem to indicate that they are observable , in principle . we have also computed the spectral features , i.e. , the wavelengths where the characteristic peaks would be observed .",
    "we anticipate that these results would be appreciated by observers .",
