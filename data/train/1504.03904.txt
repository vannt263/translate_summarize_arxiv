    "it is well established that the propagation of linearly polarized continuous - wave laser light through a near resonant atomic vapor can result in squeezing of the field with polarization component orthogonal to the incident field polarization ( vacuum squeezing ) @xcite .",

    "usually , the strong linear polarization component of the field has been used as a local oscillator @xcite .    in a previous article @xcite ,",
    "we have adopted a different point of view in which the two polarization components of the light beam are simultaneously considered . from this perspective , the squeezing effect is seen as a modification in the fluctuations of the polarization of the light i.e. the stokes operators associated to the field .",
    "a reduction of the variance of a stokes operator below the corresponding standard quantum limit ( sql ) indicates polarization squeezing @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the main advantage of using polarization modes for the investigation of the quantum properties of light is the elimination of the requirement of a local oscillator .",
    "polarization squeezing and entanglement were first obtained using two independent optical parametric amplifiers @xcite and a cold atomic cesium cloud inside an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the fact that polarization squeezing does not require a shared local oscillator , it was recently used for entanglement distribution @xcite and long distance quantum communication @xcite .    in this article",
    "we go a step forward in the examination of the fluctuation properties of the polarization state of laser light transmitted through an atomic sample by incorporating the additional assumption of the gaussian statistics of the quantum state of the light field .",
    "these states have a very elegant mathematical description and are simple to manipulate . also , gaussian states of light are commonly encountered : the vacuum and the coherent states are gaussian and so are the squeezed vacuum and the displaced squeezed vacua .",

    "the psr effect results in squeezed vacuum of the vacuum polarization component . based on the above",
