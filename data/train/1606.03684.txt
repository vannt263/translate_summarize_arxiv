    "the verigin problem concerns compressible two - phase potential flows driven by surface tension .",
    "it is the compressible analogue to the muskat problem in which the phases are incompressible .",
    "in contrast to the muskat problem , there is only scarce work on the verigin problem .",
    "we only know of the papers @xcite , which address local existence in some special cases , mostly excluding surface tension , which is physically questionable . none of these papers deals with thermodynamical consistency , equilibria , stability questions , and large time behaviour of solutions . also , there are no results at all on the verigin problem with phase transition .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to close these gaps .",
    "we develop a fairly complete dynamical theory for the verigin problem with and without phase transition .",
    "this includes local well - posedness , thermodynamical consistency , identification of the equilibria , discussion of their stability , the local semiflows on the proper state manifolds , as well as convergence to equilibrium of solutions which do not develop singularities in a sense to be specified . to a large extent",

    "the domain @xmath6 consists of two parts , @xmath7 is the so - called _ disperse phase _ and @xmath8 is the _ continuous phase _ , @xmath9 denotes the _ interface_. in particular , we assume no _ boundary contact_. the outer normal of @xmath7 will be denoted by @xmath10 , the corresponding _ normal velocity _ of @xmath11 by @xmath12 , and the _ normal jump _ of a quantity @xmath13 across @xmath11 by @xmath14\\!]:= v_2-v_1 $ ] .",
    "a typical initial geometry is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the free energies in the phases will be given functions @xmath15 which may depend on the phase .",
    "the relation between pressure and density in each phase is given by maxwell s law , which reads @xmath16 we assume that this function is strictly increasing , hence we may invert it to obtain the so - called _ equation of state _ @xmath17 .    the converse statement is also true . given an equation of state @xmath18 with @xmath19 strictly increasing , inverting this relation we find @xmath20 and @xmath21 can then be found from @xmath22 , up to a constant .",
