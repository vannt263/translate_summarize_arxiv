    "the most metal - rich stars in dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) have been shown to have significantly lower even - z abundance ratios than stars of similar metallicity in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "in addition , the most metal - rich dsph stars are dominated by an s - process abundance pattern in comparison to stars of similar metallicity in the mw .",
    "this has been interpreted as excessive contamination by type ia super - novae ( sn ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( bonifacio et al . 2000 , shetrone et al .",
    "2001 , smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2002 ) . by comparing these results to mw chemical evolution , lanfranchi & matteucci ( 2003 )",
    "conclude that the dsph galaxies have had a slower star formation rate than the mw ( lanfranchi & matteucci 2003 ) .",
    "this slow star formation , when combined with an efficient galactic wind , allows the contribution of type ia sn and agb stars to be incorporated into the ism before the type ii sn can bring the metallicity up to mw thick disk metallicities .",
    "recent abundance ratio work in this field falls into two categories .",
    "the first category has been investigations into aspects of metal - poor agb and type ia sn yields and their relationship to the chemical evolution in the dsph galaxies , e.g. mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , venn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , mcwilliam & smecker - hane ( 2005 ) . in these",
    "works the abundances of specific elements are compared to predictions of yields of low metallicity sn and agb stars . while the origins of these elements , such as mn , cu and y , may seem slightly esoteric , these types of analyses will help constrain future models of sn yields",
    ".    the second catagory of dsph abundance investigations has been attempts to gain large enough samples to accurately model the extent of the chemical evolution , the relative contributions the type ia and agb yields and to what extent galactic winds have played a roll in the chemical evolution .",
    "the new instruments that have come on - line in the last year have increased the multiplexing capabilities of these surveys .",
    "as an example , figure 1 shows preliminary results from the dwarf abundance and radial velocity team ( dart ) eso large program ; using uves flames@xmath0giraffe on a sample of sculptor dsph giants , hill ( private communication , 2005 ) collected nearly 100 stellar spectra , a sample larger than all of the literature high resolution dsph surveys combined .",
    "this survey will be able to show subtle declines and trends that the other surveys could never detect .",
    "the decline seen in [ ca / fe ] with increasing [ fe / h ] reported by shetrone et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and geisler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are easily detected .",
    "the spread in [ ca / fe ] at a given metallicity is being investigated by dart",
    ".    flames .",
    "this data , from hill ( private communication , 2005 ) exhibits the steep decline of [ ca / fe ] with increasing [ fe / h ] seen in all dsph .",
    "in addition , the most metal - poor stars do not exhibit the typical mw halo ratio near 0.3 dex.,scaledwidth=81.0% ]",
    "in a closed box or leaky - box chemical evolution model the most metal - poor stars would have formed before the majority of the type ia sn or the agb stars were significant contributors to the the ism .",
    "thus , the abundances of these very metal - poor stars should be excellent surrogates of the pop iii and very metal - poor pop ii type ii sn products held in the dsph gravitational potential .",
    "this last point is important because if the yields of some masses of type ii sn are lost from the dsph gravitational potential then this might significantly impact abundance ratios found in the next generation of dsph stars .",
    "the first papers in this field suggested that the overall alpha abundances found in the most metal - poor dsph stars are not similar to those found in the halo .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis of the individual elements including corrections for differences in log gf values has shown that the o and mg abundances are consistent with those found in the mw halo , while the ca and ti abundances are systematically lower than those in the mw halo , see figure 1 , 2 and 6 in shetrone ( 2004 ) .",
    "this can also be seen in figure 1 which shows that the most metal - poor sculptor stars have [ ca / fe ] ratios less than 0.2 dex while the halo median at this metallicity is roughly 0.15 dex larger .",
    "the difficulty with studies of the most metal - poor dsph stars is actually finding the most metal - poor stars .",
    "not only are these stars less numerous than their more metal - rich counter parts , but their spatial distribution is larger than the more metal - rich stars , e.g. tolstoy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , palma et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , harbeck et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , majewski et al .",
    "the use of high resolution multi - object spectrographs such as flames becomes less efficient in the search for the most - metal poor stars because of the large spatial extent , rarity and huge background contamination .",
    "for these types of studies targeting single star high resolution spectral follow - up to photometric or low resolution surveys can be more appropriate .",
    "one star analyzed in the shetrone et al .",
    "( 1998 ) survey was found to be very metal - poor but with fairly low overall - alpha abundances .",
    "unfortunately , due to the low s / n and low metallicity many of the elements had upper limits and large error bars .",
    "this single star , draco 119 , was re - observed by fulbright et al .",
    "( 2004 ) with much higher s / n .",
    "they were able to confirm that the mg abundance was halo like while the ca and ti abundances were lower than those found in the halo by a few tenths of dex .",
    "even more remarkable were the upper limits found for the neutron capture elements .",
    "fulbright et al . found upper limits for [ ba / fe ] 1 dex lower than mw halo giants of similar metallicity , and , even more amazingly , the upper limit for [ sr / fe ] was found to be nearly 2 dex lowerthan similiar mw giants .",
    "this begged the question : is the draco 119 abundance pattern unique , ie .",
    "due to some strange inhomogeneous mixing event , or is this pattern found in all very metal - poor draco stars .",
    "a search for equally metal - poor draco stars , using the hobby - eberly telescope , did not turn up any draco giants as metal - poor as draco 119 ; but it did turn up a few stars just a few tenths more metal - rich . by integrating long enough to detect the strong red ba lines in these stars using the hrs on the hobby - eberly telescope , shetrone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) did not find extremely neutron capture poor stars , see figure 2 .",
    "the abundance pattern of draco 119 appears to be a due to inhomogeneous mixing and is not found in all very metal - poor draco stars .",
    "i would like to thank kim venn , andy mcwilliam , verne smith , jon fulbright and the dart for preprints and invaluable discussions .",
    "i would also like to thank the nsf for support through ast-0306884 ; and summer reu intern john moore and the team at the het for their assistance in bringing these results to press ."
