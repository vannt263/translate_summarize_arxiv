    "perhaps one of the most outstanding insufficiencies of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is that it does not lead directly to efficient algorithms for the computation of dynamical information .",
    "in contrast , statistical quantities or imaginary - time data are relatively easy to evaluate and the mechanisms to do so are well understood.@xcite in principle , it is possible to relate the quantum correlation functions in real time to their imaginary - time counterparts by analytical continuation.@xcite however , such attempts lead to inverse problems which , albeit uniquely determined , are fundamentally ill - posed .",
    "an example is represented by the real inverse laplace transform,@xcite a technique that has been extensively utilized as a link between the real and imaginary - time worlds .",
    "it requires the resolution of a linear integral equation that becomes extremely ill - conditioned upon discretization .",
    "the treatment of such problems is the domain of regularization theory , which attempts to stabilize the resulting equations by controlling certain properties of their solution .",
    "notwithstanding earlier attempts that were more or less in tone with tikhonov s least - square approach,@xcite the pioneering research of gubernatis , jarrell , silver , and sivia@xcite has spearheaded the application of methods of bayesian statistical inference with entropic priors@xcite as a regularization technique for the inversion of the laplace transform . to give a few examples ,",
    "although somewhat restricted to the direct research interests of the present author , such methods have been successfully applied for the computation of various physical properties such as spectra,@xcite quantum rates of reaction,@xcite and diffusion constants.@xcite when we say `` successfully , '' we take into account the fact that , in most cases , there are virtually no computationally feasible alternatives : the techniques based on imaginary - time data are amenable to direct monte carlo path integral treatment and exhibit little degradation of their stability with the increase in the physical dimensionality .",
    "this is so because the stability is related to the properties of the spectral function ( a one - dimensional probability distribution ) and not to the dimensionality of the physical system .",
    "nevertheless , as jarrell and gubernatis point out,@xcite `` to solve an ill - posed problem , nothing beats good data . '' the present paper does not attempt to improve on previous results regarding the stabilization of the inverse problems .",
    "rather , its purpose is to provide a means to obtain high - quality input data for the reconstruction of various autocorrelation functions for physical systems in the continuum space .",
    "a recent study of the present author@xcite suggests that one way to achieve better results is to break the inverse laplace problem into two separate steps : computation of moments by differencing an estimating functional ( which is related to the imaginary - time correlation function ) followed by resolution of the ensuing symmetric hamburger moment problem .",
    "both steps are exponentially unstable , albeit to a lesser degree than the original problem .",
    "very likely , their combined effect is a problem that is as ill - conditioned as the original one .",
    "quite clearly , we can not create new information in a stable and consistent manner just by manipulating the data .",
    "is there any gain in the new approach ?",
    "the reason we shy away from exponentially unstable algorithms is that they require the utilization of exponentially fast algorithms ( polynomial in the number of digits ) for the computation of the input data .",
    "unfortunately , most of the algorithms we posses converge polynomially in the best circumstances and there are only a few instances of exponentially fast algorithms . some of the more interesting examples are related to the execution time of elementary functions on a classical computer , in arbitrary precision .",
    "in fact , brent@xcite has shown that the evaluation of elementary functions can be performed in time proportional to @xmath1 with respect to the number of digits @xmath2 . therefore , as ref .",
    "argues , differencing an arbitrarily smooth estimating functional is a computationally feasible approach whenever empirical potentials are utilized .",
    "the present author has obtained excellent results in unpublished tests that have employed amber force fields@xcite and bailey s arbitrary precision package mpfun90.@xcite    however , such a technique can not be applied for potentials that are the result of a computation performed in polynomial time .",
    "in addition , there is some unease related to the mere requirement of arbitrary precision . in most circumstances , we are interested in learning the properties of the spectral function in the low frequency region ( for some transport phenomena , we are interested in the value at the origin of the spectral function associated with the flux - flux@xcite or velocity - velocity@xcite correlation functions ) . due to quantum and thermal smoothing , the low - frequency portion of the spectral function is largely insensitive to the precision with which the potential is known . clearly , whether we use an otherwise smooth potential with @xmath3 ( single precision ) or @xmath4 ( double precision ) significant digits , we do not expect the value of a diffusion coefficient to change dramatically and this expectation is justified in many cases by results of perturbation theory .",
    "it follows that the instability of the differencing step is a property of the algorithm and not necessarily an inner characteristic of the problem .    in section",
    "iv , we show that the instability associated with the differencing step can be removed by interpolation of the action . that is , the path - integral action , regarded as a function of the imaginary time on the interval @xmath5 , is replaced by a smooth interpolant constructed by means of trigonometric or chebyshev polynomials . for infinitely differentiable potentials",
    ", the interpolant converges faster than any polynomial and it rapidly feels the discontinuities due to the finite precision in the computation of the action .",
    "however , if it is known that the potential is smooth , one can utilize a low - degree interpolant only . by the arguments in the preceding section , the properties of the spectral functions in the low - frequency region and ,",
    "therefore , the values of the low - order moments are not sensitive to the errors in the action . despite the fact that the interpolated action may not necessarily come from a perturbed potential",
    ", the numerical results of section  v suggest that the computed monte carlo data still represent a sequence of moments , even for low - order interpolants .",
    "we commence this paper , however , with section  ii , where we present a short review of the moment problem and discuss its relevance for the reconstruction of spectral functions . in section  iii , benefitting from the existence of certain mathematical results concerning the hamburger moment problem , we give necessary and sufficient criteria for inversion algorithms to exist .",
    "these criteria can be utilized as an a posteriori verification tool for the computed data and they reveal the exponential extent of the instability of the moment problem .",
    "nevertheless , this instability has to be weighted against the fact that the information furnished even by a few tens of moments is , in general , quite substantial . in section",
    "vi , we review the main findings of the present work and enumerate several research issues left outstanding .",
    "the dynamical quantity we want to evaluate is a quantum correlation function of the type@xcite @xmath6 the operator @xmath7 stands for the hamiltonian of the system , a self - adjoint and bounded from below operator , whereas @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the real time and the inverse temperature , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the adjoint of the operator @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 may take values in the interval @xmath13 .",
    "the values of the correlation functions for @xmath14 can be recovered as the corresponding limits , by continuity arguments .",
    "many quantities of physical interest are related to the quantum correlation function defined by @xmath15 .",
    "however , the correlation functions defined by the parameter @xmath12 are related one to each other by simple identities in the fourier space .",
    "let us consider the associated spectral functions , which are defined by the fourier transforms @xmath16 with the help of the identity @xmath17 which is valid for all complex @xmath18 with @xmath19 , one computes @xmath20 } dt \\right ] dede'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] simple manipulations by means of the fourier representation of the delta function show that @xmath21 therefore , the fourier transforms of the correlation functions are non - negative distributions ( in fact , they are thermal averages of certain power spectra ) .",
    "if we denote the special value for @xmath22 by @xmath23 , then we have the relationship @xmath24 which shows that all correlation functions defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) carry essentially the same information .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the spectral function @xmath23 is symmetrical about the origin and we shall refer to the corresponding correlation function as the thermally - symmetrized correlation function .",
    "berne and harp@xcite have pointed out that the computation of thermally - symmetrized quantum correlation functions @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , might be an easier computational task . certain quantities of physical interest , such as rates of reaction or diffusion constants , only depend on the value at the origin of the spectral functions , value that is independent of the particular choice of @xmath12 .",
    "miller , schwartz , and tromp@xcite have utilized this independence to point out that the thermally - symmetrized flux - flux correlation function has better mathematical properties than the yamamoto flux - flux correlation function,@xcite which corresponds to an average over @xmath12 on the interval @xmath13 .",
    "more recently , predescu and miller@xcite have argued that the thermally - symmetrized spectral function is the one for which the moments ( and , in general , any short - time information ) are the most sensitive with respect to changes in the values of the spectral function near the origin . in other words , for this particular choice of correlation function , the values of the spectral function near the origin are expected to have the best continuity properties with respect to variations in the moments .    from eq .",

    "( [ eq:5 ] ) , we obtain the laplace identity @xmath30 the inverse of which is the thermally - symmetrized spectral function .",
    "having reached this point in our presentation , we pause and ask whether or not eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) uniquely determines the spectral function .",
    "the answer is affirmative and follows from different arguments , all of which are based on the fact that the spectral function is _",
    "positive_. thus , one could follow the path of baym and mermin@xcite and use positivity to argue that the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) is absolutely integrable . in turn",
    ", this implies that the correlation function @xmath31 must be analytic in the complex plane on the strip defined by @xmath32 .",
    "standard results of complex analysis then show that @xmath31 for real @xmath33 and , therefore , @xmath23 are uniquely determined by the values of @xmath34 on the interval @xmath35 .",
    "the absolute integrability of @xmath36 plays an important role in the proof of uniqueness and it should not be taken easy . indeed , if the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) is only required to converge in the cauchy principal value sense , then there exist an infinity of solutions , of which only one is positive [ non - positive examples are furnished by the fourier transforms of eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) ] .",
    "the issue is relevant because both absolute integrability and analyticity are constraints on the set of admissible solutions that are very difficult to implement on a computer . by comparison , enforcement of positivity",
    "is a more achievable goal .",
    "if we also use the a priori information that @xmath34 and @xmath23 are symmetric , the problem that must by solved in the context of the inverse laplace transform method is : find the positive and symmetric distribution @xmath23 that satisfies the equation @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "the input data for this problem is usually a finite sequence of values of the imaginary - time correlation function on an equally - spaced grid @xmath39 . upon discretization ,",
    "the functional equation exhibits multiple solutions and becomes determinate only upon the specification of an inversion algorithm .",
    "the main problem a computational physicist has to face is that the original functional equation is ill - posed in the sense of hadamard .",
    "although the problem has a unique solution , this solution lacks continuity with the input data for virtually any computationally reasonable topology .",
    "for example , there are sequences of functions @xmath40 with @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , such that the problem @xmath43 has no solutions for any @xmath44 .",
    "thus , just by mere control of the relative errors in the input data , we are not even guaranteed an inversion algorithm , much less a sequence of approximations to the spectral function that converges to @xmath23 as @xmath45 .",
    "another approach to proving the uniqueness of the solution of the inverse laplace transform is via moments.@xcite first , one utilizes the positivity of the spectral function to demonstrate that the taylor series of the correlation function @xmath31 about the origin has a convergence radius equal to or larger than @xmath46 .",
    "the sequence of even derivatives of the imaginary - time correlation function at the origin reads @xmath47 the odd moments are zero , by the symmetry of the spectral function .",
    "the ensuing symmetric hamburger moment problem is then demonstrated to be uniquely determined , thus both proving the uniqueness of the reconstructed spectral function and suggesting an alternative computational approach .",
    "unfortunately , the inverse moment problem also lacks continuity with the input data .",
    "thus , just by controlling the relative errors for the moments , we are not guaranteed that an inversion algorithm exists . moreover",
    ", the finite moment problem may also be undeterminate .",
    "if determinate , the finite moment problem is exponentially unstable .",
    "these stability issues will be addressed in the following section .",
    "we conclude this section by emphasizing again the requirement of positivity for the reconstructed spectral function . for any spectral function @xmath23 , there are modifications that satisfy both the full moment problem given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) and the laplace equation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) , precisely for the same input data as the physical spectral function .",
    "such modifications can be obtained by adding some integrable and infinitely differentiable function that vanishes within the interval @xmath48 to the correlation function and then taking the fourier transform .",
    "a specific example of a function that satisfies both the full moment problem and the laplace equation is provided by the fourier transform of @xmath49 & , & \\mathrm{otherwise } , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] for any arbitrary and positive parameter @xmath50 .",
    "such a fourier transform always has a non - vanishing negative part .",
    "of course , in agreement with baym and mermin s analyticity argument , the modification to the correlation function expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) is not analytical .",
    "nevertheless , there is no effective procedure to enforce analyticity numerically and the positivity of the spectral function comes in handy .",
    "we stress that this positivity must be enforced to machine accuracy : for many modifications , the negative part of the modified spectral function appears in the high frequency region and can be a very small number , difficult to recognize on a plot , even if the correlation functions are `` obviously '' different .",
    "this is just another manifestation of the instability of the inverse problems .",
    "we begin this section with a short review of the hamburger moment problem .",
    "all mathematical information contained in the present section can be found in standard references on the moment problem.@xcite a sequence of numbers @xmath51 is called a moment sequence if there exists a non - negative distribution , say @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 quite clearly , not all sequences of numbers are moment sequences .",
    "for example , any moment of even order must be a non - negative number . even more , by the non - negativity of the distribution @xmath52 , we also have @xmath54 for all sets of number @xmath55 . in matrix language",
    ", the last inequality is equivalent to the condition that the gram matrices @xmath56 are positive semi - definite ( that is , their lowest eigenvalues must be greater or equal to zero ) .",
    "a standard result from matrix analysis says that the hermitian matrix @xmath57 is positive semi - definite if and only if all determinants @xmath58 with @xmath59 are non - negative .",
    "therefore , a necessary condition for a sequence of numbers to be a moment sequence is that the matrices @xmath57 are positive semi - definite for all @xmath60 or that the determinants @xmath61 are non - negative for all @xmath60 .",
    "hamburger has demonstrated that these conditions are also sufficient for a sequence of numbers to be a moment sequence .",
    "in addition , he has shown that , given a finite sequence @xmath62 , the positive semi - definiteness of @xmath57 is sufficient for the finite moment problem to have at least a solution ( obviously , such a solution is rarely unique ) .",
    "if the quantities @xmath63 are zero , then there exists at least one symmetric solution .    as shown by eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) , the gram matrices @xmath57 have a very special structure : the skew - diagonals are made up from identical elements .",
    "such matrices , whether gram or not , are called hankel matrices . for the symmetric hamburger moment problem ,",
    "the skew - diagonals corresponding to moments of odd order are zero .",
    "the importance of the positive semi - definiteness of the matrices @xmath57 can be understood in the context of theorem  3 of ref .  , which is a standard convergence theorem in probability theory .",
    "namely , assuming that we are given a collection of moment sequences @xmath64 ( the low - rank terms of which are allowed to change with @xmath2 for generality ) and letting @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the associated spectral and correlation functions , respectively , the convergence @xmath67 implies @xmath68 this result appears to contradict our previous assertion that the moment problem lacks continuity with the input data . to the contrary , the theorem provides a means of approximating the exact correlation function .",
    "the explanation is that theorem  3 requires the input data @xmath64 to be finite moment sequences and it is this requirement that lacks continuity with the input data .",
    "more exactly , for any @xmath69 , there exist a rank @xmath2 and numbers @xmath70 such that @xmath71 , yet the new data are not a moment sequence ( their gram matrix is not positive semi - definite )",
    ". let us consider a particular case where @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we know all the moments with @xmath73 relative accuracy .",
    "is this enough to be able to generate a good approximation to the correlation function ?",
    "the answer is no . as the results in the remainder of the present section show",
    ", it is very likely that the data we posses do not form a moment sequence , even for moderately large @xmath2 .    for our symmetric problem , the moments of odd order are zero and , therefore , their value is exactly known . in agreement with the hypothesis of theorem  3 , we require of any computational procedure to be able to provide the even - order moments with controlled relative error . by making this relative error small , we may assume that the even - order moments are positive .",
    "according to the discussion in the preceding paragraph , for the reconstruction algorithm to converge to the exact result in the limit that the relative error for the even - order moments converges to zero , it is sufficient that the inequalities @xmath74 are satisfied for all numbers @xmath55 . by the positivity of the quantities @xmath75 , this condition is , of course , equivalent to the one provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "however , it also takes into account the fact that the relative errors of the moments @xmath76 are controlled . by making the substitution @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) , we see that the above inequality is equivalent to the condition that the hermitian matrices @xmath78 of entries @xmath79 are positive semi - definite .",
    "we summarize the findings obtained so far in the present section in the following theorem , which gives sufficient criteria for the existence of well - posed inversion algorithms .    for each @xmath80 ,",
    "let @xmath81 be a finite sequence of positive moment data .",
    "let @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , and assume that the hermitian matrices @xmath78 of entries @xmath84 are positive semi - definite",

    "we shall use the notation @xmath89 for the moment data and understand that they are subject to both systematic and statistical errors .    in view of the above theorem",
    ", it is quite unfortunate that the matrices @xmath78 are ill - conditioned ( although they are better behaved than the matrices @xmath57 ) . in a research born out of frustration with the numerical instabilities of an otherwise reasonable algorithm , tyrtyshnikov@xcite has demonstrated that the condition number ( the ratio between the largest and the smallest eigenvalues ) of any positive semi - definite hankel matrix grows at least exponentially .",

    "( [ eq:38 ] ) , which involves the use of complex numbers , already betrays the approach we shall utilize to compute the derivatives of the estimating function at the origin : contour integration of the complex extension of the non - linear chebyshev approximation in the complex plane .",

    "lyness@xcite has demonstrated that this simple - looking algorithm is numerically stable and converges exponentially fast with respect to the number of quadrature knots @xmath174 .",
    "for this reason , the algorithm is known as lyness method .",
    "although criteria for choosing optimal values for the radius @xmath175 are known , numerical tests show that the ad - hoc value of @xmath176 produces excellent results .",
    "we conclude the present section by pointing out an issue of convergence and precision . unless the potential function is analytical",
    ", one can not extend the estimating functional @xmath109 to the entire complex plane .",
    "thus , the non - linear chebyshev approximation , although convergent on the real interval @xmath5 , diverges on the complex disk of radius @xmath46 , as the rank @xmath2 of the interpolating polynomial goes to infinity .",
    "we take advantage of the rapid convergence and the stability of lyness method to compensate for this divergence .",
    "however , to also compensate for the loss in precision in the evaluation of the integrand , one may need to evaluate the chebyshev polynomials as well as the final non - linear approximation in higher precision .",
    "numerical tests show that this divergence is very weak and that the need for higher precision seems only theoretical . with the increase in the rank of the chebyshev approximation beyond a certain level ,",
    "we do notice a sudden divergence , but this is caused by the limited precision with which the high - order coefficients are determined and appears even for analytical potentials .",
    "the convergence of the chebyshev approximation is normally so fast that it rapidly feels the lack of smoothness of the action due to the finite precision of the machine .",
    "thus , the high - order coefficients , instead of decaying steadily to zero , remain roughly constant as magnitude .",
    "one counteracts this artifact by truncating the chebyshev series to a safe number of coefficients ( usually less than @xmath117 in single precision and less than @xmath118 in double precision ) .",
    "the sudden divergence can be easily spotted by comparing the values of @xmath177 computed with two slightly different estimators : the first one utilizes the estimating functional @xmath178 ( more precisely , to account for the case when the polynomials are regressed , the value at the origin of its non - linear approximation in terms of chebyshev polynomials ) , whereas the second one utilizes the cauchy contour integral @xmath179 the agreement for the computed values of @xmath177 must be better than the minimal accuracy that would guarantee the positive semi - definiteness of the stability matrices .",

    "the potential is @xmath182 with @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 the parameters for the barrier are chosen to correspond approximately to the @xmath186 reaction .",

    "let us summarily describe the main features of the monte carlo path integral technique utilized . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) , what we actually compute are the ratios @xmath187 , where    @xmath188}.\\ ] ]    although the normalization coefficient @xmath189 can also be determined by monte carlo integration , its value is irrelevant for the present study .",
    "the path integral technique utilized is based on the fourth - order short - time approximation introduced in ref .  .",
    "a trotter index of @xmath117 has been employed , for a total of @xmath190 path variables . in order to diminish the amount of correlation in the monte carlo chain",
    ", we have utilized the so - called fast sampling algorithm considered in ref .   as well as the parallel tempering technique .",
    "the parallel tempering exchanges have been performed with replicas of temperatures arranged in geometric progression up to @xmath191 .",
    "a total of @xmath192 million complete sweeps through the space of path variables have been made .",
    "these sweeps have been divided in @xmath193 blocks .    naturally , the monte carlo simulation consists of two parts : sampling and accumulation of averages for the estimating functionals . due to the nature of the fast sampling algorithm , which organizes the path variables in @xmath194 layers with the variables from the same layer sampled separately ( and independently ) , the computational cost for a sweep is @xmath195 calls to the potential function .",
    "the computational cost for the estimating functionals is @xmath196 calls .",
    "the factor @xmath197 comes from the three different types of functions that are called [ @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 whereas the factor @xmath118 represents the number of chebyshev knots .",
    "we mention that even for such a simple analytical potential , the largest part of the computation is spent on the evaluation of the potential and its derivatives and not on performing the numerical manipulations considered in the preceding section . in order to dedicate comparable amounts of time to the sampling and estimator evaluation parts",
    ", we have evaluated the estimators every @xmath201 sweeps .",
    "we made this analysis just in order to warn the reader about the magnitude of the computational cost incurred by the evaluation of the estimating functionals for derivatives .",
    "thus , it is not worth to accumulate averages after each sweep , especially given the usually large correlation of the monte carlo sampler ( it is very rare that the correlation times are smaller than @xmath202 in realistic simulations ) .    as mentioned before",
    ", the main purpose of the present development is to provide a technique that is capable of producing accurate estimates for the high order derivatives without the need to evaluate the potential function in arbitrary precision .",
    "therefore , the potential function and its derivatives utilized in the construction of the estimating functionals have been evaluated in single precision ( about @xmath3 significant decimal digits ) only .",
    "this is also the precision with which the chebyshev coefficients are evaluated . on the other hand ,",
    "the evaluation of the chebyshev polynomials , the contour integration in the complex plane , and the accumulation of averages have been performed in quadruple precision ( about @xmath203 significant decimal digits ) . the sampling part of the simulation has been conducted in double precision ( about @xmath4 significant decimal digits ) . to complete the description of the algorithm , we mention that the chebyshev polynomials have been regressed to the first @xmath117 coefficients and",
    "the contour integration has been performed in @xmath190 quadrature knots .",
    "we accumulate the averages in quadruple precision in anticipation of the loss of precision due to the exponential instability of the matrices @xmath78 .",
    "we stress that , although the moments @xmath89 are determined with a precision of a few digits only , an important amount of information resides in the remaining imprecise digits . to understand how this may happen ,",
    "let us analyze the problem of computing the moments if the spectral function is analytically known and can itself be sampled .",
    "thus , we compute averages of the type @xmath204 for @xmath205 by monte carlo integration .",
    "the actual ratios in @xmath206 sample points are @xmath207 where @xmath208 is some discrete measure that depends upon the history of the monte carlo integration .",
    "we notice that _ irrespective _ of what this discrete measure is , the sequence of numbers @xmath209 is a _ moment sequence _ because it comes from some positive measure .",
    "it therefore satisfies the requirements of positive semi - definiteness of the stability matrices @xmath78 regardless of the actual number of samples @xmath206 .",
    "it also exhibits the same instability issues as the original problem .",
    "theoretically , if we determine the whole sequence of moments @xmath210 for some fixed @xmath206 with arbitrary precision , we can reconstruct the measure that has generated the sequence , that is , the distribution @xmath211 .",
    "but if these statistically inexact moments are not known with sufficient precision , the exponential instability will cause them to loose the crucial property that they form a moment sequence .",
    "the lesson we learn from the preceding exposition is that we can not compute moments of different orders in independent monte carlo runs , because it is difficult to attain the precision necessary to ensure the positive semi - definiteness of the stability matrices @xmath78 . in this paper , we declare ourselves content with the simultaneous computation of the moments in the same monte carlo simulation .",
    "we mention , however , that this is not necessarily without penalty . if , for example , one is interested in evaluating the tail of the spectral function [ which decays like @xmath104 , as eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) with @xmath22 suggests ] , then there are going to be problems related to the fact that the tail of the distribution is infrequently sampled by the monte carlo walker because of its exponentially vanishing statistical weight .",
    "accordingly , the information contained in the moments determined by monte carlo integration poorly reproduces the properties of the tail .",
    "thus , our assumption is that we are interested in the properties of the spectral function near the origin or in regions of important statistical weight .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     under this assumption ,",
    "the poor statistics for the computation of high order moments mentioned in the preceding paragraph is harmless .",
    "it also serves to show that the relationship between the quality of the reconstructed spectral functions and the relative errors of the moments is far from being a linear one .",
    "however , we do need to worry about the fact that the estimating functionals for the high order derivatives appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) are generally not positive quantities . as such , there is the real possibility that , due to large cancellations between the positive and negative parts , the computed sequence @xmath212 may not be a moment sequence . in fact , taking into account the exponential instability of the matrices @xmath78 , one needs to worry about the limitations caused by the utilization of a finite trotter index as well as about the inherent numerical limitations of the pseudo - spectral methods utilized .",
    "all these systematic errors are additional to the statistical errors .",
    "it appears then quite surprising that the present approach is extremely capable in this respect .",
    "the reader may use the results in table  [ tab : i ] to verify that the stability matrix @xmath213 is , indeed , positive definite ( due to their structure , the stability matrices @xmath78 for @xmath214 are also positive definite ) .",
    "we mention that we have verified the positive definiteness of the matrices @xmath213 ( by performing a cholesky decomposition@xcite ) not only for the final data , but also for the individual averages collected for each of the @xmath193 blocks in which the monte carlo simulation has been divided !",
    "why the algorithm is so capable in dealing with the sign problem is something that the author can not explain at the present time .",
    "as demonstrated by the results in table  [ tab : i ] , the relative statistical errors increase quickly with the order of the moments and reach a plateau at about @xmath215 .",
    "this behavior seems to be caused by poor statistics , in a way that is perhaps similar with the previously discussed case , where the spectral function is sampled directly .",
    "we have noticed that , for @xmath216 , the block averages fail to become independent and the monte carlo correlation times are comparable to the length of the simulation .",
    "it is therefore of certain interest to design alternative sampling techniques that would improve the statistics by use of suitable importance functions .",
    "however , the techniques should preserve the property of positive semi - definiteness of the stability matrices .",
    "such a task appears formidable because the condition numbers of the stability matrices increase exponentially , according to the law @xmath105 .",
    "this exponential instability is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "asymptotic behavior of the quantities @xmath102 for the flux - flux spectral function of the eckart barrier . as for the free particle case , we notice that the matrices @xmath78 become exponentially unstable .",
    "the condition number of the stability matrices increases roughly as @xmath105 for large @xmath2 .",
    ", width=321 ]",
    "we have provided an in - depth analysis of the problem of constructing estimators for the purpose of computing moments of spectral functions by path integral simulations .",
    "the estimators are constructed by formal differentiation of a certain estimating functional against the imaginary time .",
    "we have argued that the numerical differentiation can be more successfully implemented by means of pseudospectral methods , in a way that utilizes information from the entire interval @xmath0 .",
    "the algorithmic detail that leads to robust numerical approximations is the fact that the action - like functionals and not the actual estimating functional are interpolated . the derivatives at the origin can be computed from the ensuing non - linear approximation in a fast and stable way by contour integration in the complex plane , with the help of lyness method .",
    "we have improved upon the convergence results of ref .   by stating theorem  1 , which provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of convergent reconstruction algorithms .",
    "the hypothesis of the new theorem is now based on assertions that are verifiable solely from the computed data . in particular , we have pointed out that the existence of inverse algorithms is inherently related to the positive semi - definiteness of certain matrices , which , however , prove to be exponentially unstable .",
    "although the main statements that lead to theorem  1 are well - known results from the mathematical literature , we believe it is worth having them systematized in a single statement , for the benefit of the readers .    one of the main assumptions made throughout the present work is that the potential function is infinitely differentiable . this assumption is not necessarily a limitation if one takes into account the existence of the partial averaging technique,@xcite which replaces the action - like variables by smooth versions obtained by convolution with gaussians of certain widths .",
    "such convolutions are , of course , differentiable infinitely many times.@xcite for most practical applications , the value of the gaussian width remains orders of magnitude larger than the resolution capabilities of the working precision . in other words ,",
    "the interpolation technique utilized still `` sees '' a smooth functional even for the largest numbers of path variables that make the approximation convergent for all practical purposes . for these reasons ,",
    "the partial averaging technique can be thought of as the natural setting for the implementation of the present approach .",
    "several questions related to the moment approach remain to be answered .",
    "the first one asks for an explanation of why the pseudo - spectral technique utilized leads to estimators that , upon largely inaccurate monte carlo integration , still produce a sequence of moments . by `` largely inaccurate , '' we mean that the statistical errors are orders of magnitude larger than the working precision required by the observed exponential instability of the matrices @xmath78 .",
    "even the systematic errors introduced by the chebyshev approximation are significantly larger than the required precision .",
    "a second question asks why the sign problem that should have ruined the monte carlo simulation is actually very mild .",
    "a third question is related to the development of sampling techniques , perhaps by means of suitable importance functions , that would alleviate the poor statistics associated with the computation of high - order moments , yet would preserve the positive semi - definiteness of the stability matrices .",
    "a final task calls for the development of actual reconstruction techniques of the spectral functions from their moments and for studies of the suitability of the various techniques for specific problems .",
