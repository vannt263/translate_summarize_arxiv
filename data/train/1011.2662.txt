    "it is well known that quantum interference leads to significant sample - to - sample fluctuations in the conductance at low temperatures .",
    "these fluctuations can be observed in a single sample as a function of external parameters such as the magnetic field since the variation of magnetic field has a similar effect on the interference pattern as the variation in impurity configuration .",
    "one of the fundamental problems of mesoscopic physics is to understand the statistical distribution of the conductance in disordered systems@xcite .",
    "it has been established that in the diffusive regime , the conductance of any metallic sample fluctuates as a function of chemical potential , impurity configuration ( or magnetic field ) with a universal conductance fluctuation ( ucf ) that depends only on the dimensionality and the symmetry of the system.@xcite the ucf is given by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 for quantum dot ( qd ) , quasi - one dimension ( 1d ) , two dimensions ( 2d ) square and three dimensions cubic sample with @xmath6 . here",
    "the index @xmath7 corresponds to circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe ) when the time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetries are present ( @xmath8 ) , circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) if time - reversal symmetry is broken ( @xmath9 ) and circular symplectic ensemble ( cse ) if the spin - rotation symmetry is broken while time - reversal symmetry is maintained ( @xmath10 ) , respectively.@xcite in the crossover regime from diffusive to localized regimes , the conductance distribution was found to be a universal function that depends only on the average conductance for quasi-1d , 2d , and qd _ mesoscopic _ systems and for @xmath11.@xcite in the localized regime , the conductance distribution seems to be independent of dimensionality and ensemble symmetry.@xcite    in the presence of a superconducting lead , using random matrix theory ( rmt ) , the conductance fluctuations in the mesoscopic normal and superconductor hybrid systems have been studied in the diffusive regime for quasi-1d systems@xcite and qd system.@xcite it was found that the ucf in a coe system shows approximately a twofold increase over the normal systems , i.e. , @xmath12.@xcite different from the normal conductor , in the presence of superconducting lead , electron - hole degeneracy ( ehd ) plays a similar role of `` symmetry '' .",
    "ucf assumes different value depending on whether ehd is broken or not . according to rmt,@xcite the andreev conductance fluctuation @xmath13 ( with ehd ) and @xmath14 ( with ehd broken ) were predicted . up to now , however , most of the investigations on andreev conductance fluctuation have been done for systems with ehd ( @xmath15 ) and low energy regime ( @xmath16 where @xmath17 is thouless energy ) .",
    "there is not yet a numerical study on the ns hybrid system where ehd is broken .",
    "in fact , for the existing studies on the ns hybrid system with ehd , there is no consensus on the theoretical predicted value of @xmath18 .",
    "specifically , concerning the increase factor @xmath19 in  @xmath20 \" , a diagrammatic theory predicted @xmath21,@xcite and a numerical calculation using tight binding model gave @xmath22,@xcite and the random matrix theory indicated @xmath23@xcite and @xmath24.@xcite    recently , graphene based normal - metal - superconductor ( gns ) systems were intensively studied because good contacts between the superconductor electrodes and graphene have been realized experimentally.@xcite in a conventional ( quadratic energy dispersion relation ) normal - metal - superconductor ( cns ) system , the usual andreev reflection ( ar ) occurs.@xcite for gns systems , ar can be either intravalley or intervalley , which are called andreev retroreflection ( arr ) and specular andreev reflection ( sar ) , respectively.@xcite when the excitation energy @xmath25 is smaller than that of incident energy relative to dirac point @xmath26 , arr happens , otherwise sar occurs . at the transition point @xmath27 between arr and sar , the reflection angle @xmath28 ( measured relative to the ns junction normal ) jumps from @xmath29 to @xmath30,@xcite the shot noise vanishes and the fano factor has a universal value.@xcite in general ,",
    "sar differs from arr or conventional ar ( car ) where an extra phase @xmath31 which can be observed in the quantum interference of the two sar reflections.@xcite    so far most of investigations on ucf focus on the fermi electrons ( quadratic dispersion relation ) with the zero or low energy and less attention is paid on the dirac electrons .",
    "in addition there is no numerical work reporting andreev conductance fluctuation when ehd is broken",
    ". it would be interesting to ask the following questions .",
    "what happens to ucf for gns systems ?",
    "is it the same as that in cns systems ?",
    "is there any difference between arr and sar ? which theoretically predicted value of ucf for the quasi-1d cns system ( with ehd ) is favored ?",
    "what happened when ehd is broken ?",
    "what about the conductance distributions in these systems ?",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to address these questions .    in this paper , using the tight - binding model , we carry out a theoretical study on the sample to sample fluctuation in transport properties of phase coherent systems with normal metal - superconductor heterojunction . in view of the possible difference among car , arr and sar",
    ", we consider both the cns systems using the square lattice and gns system using the honeycomb lattice .",
    "extensive numerical simulations on quasi-1d and 2d systems in the presence of a superconducting lead show that when the fermi energy is within the superconducting gap @xmath32 , ucf roughly doubles the value in the absence of the superconducting lead .",
    "this is the case for both car in cns system and arr and sar in gns system .",
    "so there is no distinct difference between arr and sar . besides , concerning ehd in the ns hybrid system , new universal classes are present in agreement with the prediction of rmt.@xcite two plateaus of ucf were found in our numerical results , one corresponds to the complete electron - hole symmetry@xcite class ( with ehd ) and the other to conventional electron - hole conversion ( with ehd broken ) .",
    "it was found that the case of  ehd broken \" decreases the value of ucf , again in agreement with the theoretical analysis.@xcite specifically , in the quasi-1d systems , @xmath33 for both fermi and dirac electrons is @xmath34 that is close to @xmath35 when ehd is present while when ehd is broken it is @xmath36 that is close to @xmath37 . for 2d systems , when ehd is present , @xmath38 is @xmath39 for fermi electrons and @xmath40 for dirac electrons while it is @xmath41 when ehd is broken for both fermi electrons and dirac electrons .",
    "furthermore , the different conductance distributions @xmath42 for the fixed average conductance @xmath1 also indicate this new symmetry class in localized regime .",
    "we also point out that the new universality class due to the ehd is quite different from the conventional ensemble symmetries .",
    "it was shown numerically that the conductance distribution @xmath42 in the deep localized regime for normal systems is a universal function which depends only on the average conductance @xmath1 but not on the fermi energies as well as other parameters.@xcite in addition , it does not seem to depend on the ensemble symmetry and dimensionality of the system . in the presence of the superconducting lead , our numerical results for 2d systems with @xmath8 show that the conductance distribution is still an universal function that depends only the average conductance @xmath1 .",
    "different from normal system , however , it depends on whether the system has the ehd . finally , when @xmath43 is above @xmath0 , normal transport is present .",
    "we found that the ar is suppressed by the disorder especially in the localized regime where normal transmission dominates transport processes . in this case , the ehd is irrelevant and the same universal conductance distribution is found as that in the normal systems in the localized regime .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , with the tight - binding representation , the model system including central disordered region and attached ideal normal lead and superconducting lead is introduced .",
    "the formalisms for calculating the conductance and fluctuation of conductance are then derived .",
    "iii gives numerical results along with detailed discussions .",
    "finally , a brief summary is presented in sec .",
    "the scattering theory of electronic conduction is developed by landauer,@xcite imry,@xcite and b@xmath44ttiker.@xcite it provides a complete description of quantum transport in the system without electron - electron interactions .",
    "a mesoscopic conductor can be modeled by a phase - coherent disordered region connected by ideal leads ( without disorder ) to two electron reservoirs ( normal metal or superconductor ) , which are in equilibrium at zero temperature with fixed electrochemical potential ( or fermi energy ) @xmath43 . here",

    "then the total system hamiltonian @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the hamiltonian of superconducting lead ( orange region in fig.1 ) , semi - infinite normal ribbon ( blue region in fig.1 ) and tunneling between the normal region and superconducting terminal , respectively .",
    "two kinds of structure were considered in this paper : the structure with quadratic energy dispersion [ square lattice , fig.1(a ) ] and structure with conical energy spectrum [ honeycomb lattice , fig.1(b ) ] . in the absence of the superconductor ,",
    "the whole system @xmath49 including @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be written in the tight - binding representation:@xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the index of the discrete square lattice or honeycomb lattice site which is arranged as in inset of fig.1 . here",

    "it is convenient to write the hamiltonian @xmath64 in the nambu representation,@xcite . in this representation the fermi energy of the right normal lead in equilibrium ( at zero bias ) is set to be the superconductor condensate .",
    "it is conventionally set to zero . as a result ,",
    "the spin up electrons and the spin down holes have the positive and negative energy , respectively . taking this into account the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) is cross multiplied by spin representation .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath65 in eq.([h ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the energy gap or the pair potential of the semi - infinite superconducting lead .",

    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the andreev related variance @xmath125 is drastically suppressed by the disorder . in localized regime [ @xmath126 , due to strong disorder , it is completely suppressed to almost zero . as a result",

    "we find that @xmath127 in the localized regime is also independent of dimensionality and type of lattice .",
    "it is not surprising since in localized regime , all ar related process are suppressed by the strong disorder . in absence of electron - hole conversion ,",
    "statistics of ns system are same as that of normal system . in order to improve the accuracy in the calculation",
    ", we also calculate the higher order moments and conductance distribution by averaging over 1,000,000 configurations and tabulate average conductance @xmath1 and the second , third , ... , ninth moments for the fixed @xmath129 in tab.[tabnorm ] .",
    "it is found that the n - th moment for the square lattice and the honeycomb lattice are the same .",
    "correspondingly , in fig.[normdistri](b ) , we plot the conductance distribution of @xmath130 in a 2d square and honeycomb lattices with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "we can see that when the incident energy is above the superconducting gap @xmath0 , the conductance distributions of ns system are almost indistinguishable from that of normal system with @xmath131 .",
