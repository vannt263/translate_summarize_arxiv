    "in the recent progress @xcite , we have developed a transport model to describe the hadron production in relativistic heavy ion collisions . in the model , a decoupling hypersurface of the fluid which consists of a group of splitting qgp droplets @xcite",
    "is used to emit hadrons .",
    "the model satisfies most of light hadrons spectra , but disagrees with the distributions of @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite and some heavy resonances @xcite . as another remarkable phenomenon",
    ", there seems to be significant enhancements at very low transverse momentum in some of the spectra for @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 and @xmath0 , to change the slopes . on the contrary ,",
    "the model predicts a decrease when @xmath2 drops .",
    "the idea of the hypersurface hadronization locks the emitted hadrons in the local rest frames of the hypersurface .",
    "this is right when the fluid is dense enough in the early stage of the evolution . in the later stage , when the inelastic free path becomes as long as @xmath5 , the emission fixed in the hypersurface might be less strict . considering the spectra of light hadrons are well satisfied ,",
    "as other hydrodynamic methods with decoupling hypersurface did , there must be some reasons to push the inside light hadrons to participate in the collective motions .",
    "one of the possible candidate is the elastic collision @xcite .",
    "although elastic collisions do not change the hadron abundances themselves , the effect of preventing hadrons from entering the more dense regions and being absorbed , will enhance their abundances or momenta .",
    "thus , detailed simulations on hadron transport are applied to some of the heavy hadrons , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the central events in rhic au - au 200 @xmath6 .",
    "the advantages for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are based on the condition that almost no hadrons could decay to them and their widths are large enough to neglect the affections of decays in the expanding medium . as a simplification , only selected hadrons for the measurements are simulated . the medium evolution and the feedbacks to the medium are not simulated in microscopic frames .",
    "as the cross sections of some heavy or multi - strange hadrons may be much smaller than those of light hadrons @xcite , it will provide us a possible solution to explain the various collective behaviors between different hadrons and @xmath2 regions .",
    "@xmath7,\\nonumber\\\\   { \\partial v\\over\\partial t}&=&-{1\\over 3-v^2}\\bigg[{3(1-v^2)^2\\over 4}{\\partial\\xi\\over\\partial r}+2v{\\partial v\\over\\partial r}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",

    "the @xmath9 hydrodynamic evolution with an invariant boost for the central events in rhic au - au 200 @xmath6 is determined by the method in ref @xcite .",
    "the decoupling surface here is similar to the results of surface evaporation @xcite except in the very early stage which is considered to be less important . for a group of decoupled droplets , there are no collective motions and local rest frames indeed . approximately , the whole evolution is defined , @xmath10 where the former term in the integral stands for the free flights of the droplets and the latter term is the evaporation . then , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the velocity and radius distribution of the number density of the droplets .    as we do not know the distribution of the droplets @xmath13 and can not simulate all of the droplets either , the expansion is simplified as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the symmetric dimension . considering that the droplet evolution by emitting and absorbing hadrons is not clear ,",
    "the evaporation term is omitted in our calculations .",
    "the classical transport equation for the evolution of hadron phase space distribution @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 where the second term on the left hand side is the free streaming part , and on the right hand side the lose and gain terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicate hadron absorption and production in the medium , and @xmath21 stands for the elastic term .    in the simulations , hadrons generated in qgp or decayed from heavier hadrons ,",
    "will pass through the medium and decay at the same time .",
    "thus , the gain term includes two parts , @xmath22 .",
    "the decay contribution is easy to obtain , but the term @xmath23 is complicated .",
    "the reason is that the quantitative temperature dependencies for some parameters are unknown @xcite , especially in a rapidly expanding system .",
    "therefore , the production is simplified as ideal qgp with massless quarks and gluons plus the contributions of bound states which will never change via @xmath24 , as well as the coupling constants .",
    "the simplification is based on such an idea that in large @xmath24 regions , where the inelastic free path is short and the produced hadrons may travel more distance before they escape from the medium , the affections may be less important for the simulations .",
    "thus , the approximation will be sufficient enough if the productions are well satisfied near the critical temperature @xmath25 .",
    "then , @xmath26 where @xmath27 for mesons and @xmath28 for baryons due to the quark - diquark frame @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 is the ratio of the occupation volume of all the qgp droplets to the whole volume of the system , @xmath30 is the production rate at @xmath25 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is contributions of bound states in qgp .",
    "the loss rate includes the decay rate and the medium absorption , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 at the critical temperature @xmath25 . as the expression belongs in the local rest frame of the medium , a lorentz transformation on time step",
    "is required when the simulation is applied in the selected frame .",
    "details on @xmath30 and @xmath37 are discussed in ref @xcite .",
    "it is noted , ( [ eq : pr ] ) and ( [ eq : abs ] ) are not independent , even the droplets are assumed under random distribution . when @xmath38 , the location of production and absorption is correlated .",
    "if the qgp droplets are large enough , a factor @xmath39 should be inserted to the independent productions ( [ eq : pr ] ) to remove the absorption by the droplet where the hadron is produced by qgp combination in principle .",
    "@xmath39 can be fitted as , @xmath40 where @xmath41 as discussed in above sections , the evolutions of the droplets are unjustified so far .",
    "thus we set @xmath42 and @xmath43 to minimize the parameter dependency .",
    "hadrons produced in time , position and momentum bins ( @xmath44 ) are tracked when they pass through the medium .",
    "they are recorded separately , as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the direct and reconstructed hadrons escaped from the medium by cuts and @xmath47 is the reconstructed hadrons which may decay in the medium , @xmath48 with recorded decay products @xmath49 and @xmath50    there is a small difference between our calculation and the experimental manipulations . in the experiments ,",

    "[ fig : omega ] .",
    "the simulated results look much better than the original estimations from hypersurface emissions @xcite .",
    "the productions in very low @xmath2 region are enhanced and the collective flows are reduced .",
    "the perfect @xmath1 spectrum shows the elastic collisions for @xmath1 could be neglected as they may not participate in the collective motions .",
    "as the enhancement in very low @xmath2 region for @xmath0 is still smaller than expected , elastic collisions are required in our considerations .",
    "the elastic process can be divided to two effects approximately .",
    "the acceleration pushed by the pressure gradient and the deceleration dragged by the relative motion .",
    "different from the inelastic cross sections , which is nearly stable via energy scales and parton species , the elastic cross sections vary from @xmath54 to @xmath55 @xcite , which makes it difficult to obtain a strict calculation with limited information of parton - hadron or hadron - hadron elastic differential cross sections , especially in the condition that only a few selected hadrons are simulated .",
    "heavy hadrons are discussed here to present a rough estimation on elastic process .",
    "as they are heavy , the changes of their momenta after each collision and the thermalization are supposed to be small .",
    "thus , the push and drag effects can be estimated by integrating all of the collisions or the probabilities of them .",
    "the push effect can be described in the local rest frame of the medium , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mean hadron volume of elastic collisions . as",

    "the integral could be simplified by assuming the medium particles to be massless and fixing some of the momentum symbols to a kind of average @xmath61 .",

    ".    it should be noted , as the elastic cross sections vary in a large range for different energy scales , different averages of elastic cross sections @xmath67 and @xmath68 will be reached by equations ( [ eq : push ] ) and ( [ eq : drag ] ) .",
    "the relation between them is not clear .",
    "as eq ( [ eq : push ] ) affects slow hadrons more intensively and eq ( [ eq : drag ] ) affects fast hadrons more significantly , @xmath67 might be slightly larger than @xmath68 . to make the value @xmath68 similar to @xmath67",
