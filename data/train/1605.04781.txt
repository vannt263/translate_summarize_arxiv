    "topological crystalline insulator ( tci ) @xcite , a recently discovered new class of symmetry - protected topological states with an insulating bulk gap and gapless surface states , has triggered much interest in both the modern theoretical physics and the technological applications .",
    "protected by the crystal symmetry , tcis have multiple branches of dirac - like surface states on the surfaces with the underlying symmetry .",
    "the tci phase has been experimentally realized in snte - class iv - vi semiconductors @xcite , and various of exotic properties and phenomena have been studied , such as electrically tunable spin - filtered edge states in snte thin film , topological superconductivity in indium doped snte , strain - tunable valleytronics , and so on @xcite . especially , when an out - of - plane ferromagnetic order is introduced into a tci film , the qahe with a tunable large chern number can be produced @xcite , distinguished from the case of @xmath1 1/@xmath1 2 chern - number qahe in topological insulator ( ti ) films @xcite .",
    "this has motivated many efforts to introduce magnetism in tcis by magnetic doping or proximity effects with magnetic substrates @xcite .    as an important and controllable method ,",
    "magnetic doping with 3@xmath0 tm atoms has been successfully applied in bi@xmath2te@xmath3-class tis @xcite , and qahe has been realized in experiments in cr - doped ( bi@xmath4sb@xmath5)@xmath2te@xmath3 films@xcite . in the past few years",
    ", some experimental efforts have also been devoted to study the magnetism in snte doped with 3@xmath0 tms @xcite .",
    "it is found that snte shows complex magnetic properties under different tm doping : for example , it displays ferromagnetic behavior under the doping of mn , cr or fe , while it is magnetically ineffective under doping of co or ni @xcite .",
    "however , the underlying physical mechanisms for these different magnetic behaviors are not clear yet .",
    "moreover , effective magnetic doping in snte is still a challenge  well - defined controllable magnetism in snte has never been achieved by tm doping , preventing the further investigations about magnetic effect in tcis .",
    "recently , the electronic and magnetic properties of v , cr or mn - doped snte are theoretically studied@xcite .",
    "however , the high doping concentration considered in these studies does nt agree with the realistic experiment @xcite , and probably suppresses the tci phase .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to investigate the electronic properties of tm - doped snte with a realistic experimental doping concentration and find the underlying mechanism for the arising of magnetism . in this work , we investigated the defect energetics and the local magnetic states of the 3@xmath0 tms dilutely doped in snte by using the first - principles calculations , aiming to examine whether the magnetic 3@xmath0 tm atoms can be effectively doped in snte and study the magnetic properties of snte under the realistic experimental doping concentration .",
    "we find that 3@xmath0-tm - doped snte has relatively high formation energy , which is positively correlated with the cohesive energy of the elemental tm bulk , suggesting that the uniform tm doping in snte with a higher concentration will be difficult .",
    "the tms prefer to stay in the neutral states when the fermi level is located in the gap or below the valence band maximum ( vbm ) as in realistic snte .",
    "all the magnetic atoms show high - spin electronic configurations , indicating that the spin splitting energy of 3@xmath0 tm is stronger than the crystal splitting energy of the snte ligand . without regard to magnetic coupling between the tm atoms in the dilute doping regime , the tm atoms in snte show nearly the same magnetic moments as the isolated tm atoms , except sc and cr",
    ". moreover , with relative low doping formation energy , mn - doped snte possesses the largest magnetic moments and no defect levels in the bulk gap , serving as a prominent candidate for the magnetic investigation in snte .",

    "tis @xcite , the hubbard effect u of the tm atoms is not taken into account .",

    "[ fig : form_n ] , consistent with the experimental values @xcite .",

    "this reveals that these tm atoms have similar bonding with the host when doped in snte , which may be related to the same valence state ( + 2 ) of dopants in snte .",
    "however , for the early ( sc  v ) and late ( cu  zn ) tm ions , @xmath24 varies significantly , indicating different bonding between the tm ion and the snte host ( large atomic radius distinction exists between the early / late tms and sn @xcite ) . according to the concentration formula",
