    "sterile neutrino oscillation models were proposed more than a decade ago as an explanation for the lsnd anomaly @xcite , an excess of events consistent with @xmath0 oscillations at high @xmath1 .",
    "these models relate @xmath2 appearance ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath4 and @xmath2 disappearance ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , motivating combined fits in all three oscillation channels . relatively early in the discussion of models ,",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that a three - active plus one - sterile ( 3 + 1 ) neutrino oscillation model could not reconcile the lsnd result with existing null results from other short - baseline ( sbl ) experiments , including karmen @xcite , nomad @xcite , bugey @xcite , chooz @xcite , ccfr84 @xcite , and cdhs @xcite , which had similar high @xmath1 sensitivity .",
    "however , it was shown that a three - active plus two - sterile neutrino ( 3 + 2 ) oscillation scenario provided a better description of these data sets @xcite .    in 2001 ,",
    "the miniboone experiment began running with the goal to test the lsnd result using both neutrino and antineutrino beams .",
    "this is a short - baseline appearance and disappearance experiment located at fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fermilab ) .",
    "miniboone s first results , reported in 2007 , described a search for @xmath7 oscillations @xcite .",
    "these results were incompatible with a simple two - neutrino oscillation interpretation of the lsnd signal and , within this model , miniboone excluded the lsnd result at the 98% cl .",
    "however , this same analysis reported a 3.7@xmath8 excess of electron neutrino candidate events at low energies , between 300 - 475 mev , which remains unexplained .",
    "reference @xcite included the miniboone first result in a global fit to all sbl experiments under the ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 3 + 2 ) oscillation scenarios .",
    "the analysis built on an earlier study , which introduced the possibility of cp violation @xmath9 within ( 3 + 2 ) fits @xcite . including the first miniboone results into the global fit led to two observations in ref .",
    "@xcite : 1 ) miniboone , lsnd , and the null appearance experiments ( karmen and nomad ) are compatible under a ( 3 + 2 ) sterile neutrino oscillation scenario with large cp violation .",
    "2 ) there is severe tension between appearance and disappearance experiments , at a level of more than 3@xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we will consider both observations in light of new appearance data .",
    "also , we will show that the incompatibility between appearance and disappearance experiments arises mainly from two @xmath10 disappearance data sets : cdhs and atmospheric constraints .",
    "motivated by three new results from miniboone , this paper re - examines the ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 3 + 2 ) global fits to the sbl data .",
    "these new results are : 1 ) an updated @xmath11 result @xcite ; 2 ) first results for a @xmath12 search @xcite ; and 3 ) first @xmath7 results from the numi off - axis beam at miniboone @xcite .",
    "we consider these new results in combination with seven sbl data sets .",
    "these provide constraints on : @xmath10 disappearance ( from the ccfr84 and cdhs experiments ) , @xmath13 disappearance ( from the bugey and chooz experiments ) , @xmath7 oscillations ( from the nomad experiment ) , and @xmath12 oscillations ( from the lsnd and karmen experiments ) .",
    "furthermore , we have taken into account atmospheric constraints based on the analysis of ref .",
    "these constraints have been incorporated in our analysis following the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and are included in fits to all sbl experiments , null sbl experiments , or as explicitly stated .",
    "table [ tab : sblsummary ] summarizes all sbl data sets used in the fits presented in this paper .",
    ".[tab : sblsummary ] short - baseline oscillation data sets considered in this paper , and oscillation channel that each data set constrains . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : tension ] summarizes the @xmath14-probability and pg results from ( 3 + 2 ) cp - violating fits .",
    "the upper rows summarize @xmath14-probabilities and pg s from fits to all sbl experiments , as well as fits to appearance - only , disappearance - only , neutrino - only , antineutrino - only , neutrino appearance - only , and antineutrino appearance - only data sets .",
    "appearance and disappearance data sets , as well as neutrino and antineutrino data sets , are incompatible with a pg of less than 0.1% . grouping sbl appearance - only data sets according to whether they are neutrino or antineutrino experiments yields significantly higher compatibilities98% among @xmath15 appearance experiments , and 74% among @xmath16 appearance experiments .",
    "the compatibility between @xmath15 and @xmath16 appearance - only results is lower , at 6.8% but still acceptable . in the case where disappearance experiments are included in the comparison between neutrino and antineutrino fits ,",
    "the compatibility among all @xmath16 sbl data sets remains considerably high , at 80% , as does the compatibility among all @xmath15 sbl data sets , at 43% .",
    "however the compatibility between @xmath16 and @xmath15 results is only 0.06% .",
    "the remaining rows of table [ tab : tension ] provide the @xmath14-probabilities of global fits under the same oscillation scenario where one experiment is excluded from the fit at a time ( as indicated by the `` - '' sign in the table ) .",
    "the @xmath14 probabilities of all fits are acceptable , ranging between 29.2% for a fit excluding the bugey data set , and 72.2% for a fit excluding the lsnd data set . aside from lsnd ,",
    "three experiments stand out as having the poorest compatibility when compared to a global fit with all other sbl data sets : 1 ) bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) , 2 ) cdhs and 3 ) atmospheric constraints ( atm ) .",
    "these three experiments have been identified as the possible source of tension between appearance and disappearance experiments , or neutrino and antineutrino experiments .",
    "the remaining combinations yield reasonably high compatibilities of at least 42% , with the exception of lsnd and bnb - mb(@xmath16 ) which are compatible with the remaining data sets at 2.9% and 13% , respectively .    to further test the hypothesis that the tension between appearance and disappearance experiments is a result of the bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) and cdhs data sets and atmospheric constraints ,",
    "the compatibility between appearance and disappearance experiments is re - evaluated several times .",
    "each time , a different combination of these three experiments is excluded from the fits . the results are summarized in table [ tab : tension2 ] .",
    "the compatibility among appearance and disappearance experiments with bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) , cdhs , and atmospheric constraints excluded from the fits is high , at 23.7% .",
    "the bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) data set alone is not responsible for the disagreement between appearance and disappearance experiments , as suggested by the sixth row of the table [ tab : tension2 ] . even with bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) included in the fit , a compatibility of 2.9% can be obtained if cdhs and atmospheric constraints are excluded from the fit .",
    "the same test can be performed between neutrino and antineutrino experiments .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : tension3 ] .",
    "again , the compatibility between neutrino and antineutrino experiments is re - evaluated several times ; each time , a different combination of the bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) , cdhs , and atmospheric constraint data sets is excluded from the fits .",
    "here , the compatibility among neutrino and antineutrino experiments with bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) , cdhs , and atmospheric constraints excluded from the fits is even higher , at 56% .",
    "the bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) data set is just as responsible for the disagreement between neutrino and antineutrino experiments as the cdhs data set and atmospheric constraints alone .",
    "the tension seems to be caused by all three experiments , as none of them independently excluded from the fit can accound for the increase in compatibility from @xmath171% ( or less ) to 56% .",
    "it is possible that higher compatibility between bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) and all remaining sbl data sets may be achieved if the fits are to be repeated with the low energy region ( 200@xmath18475 mev ) excluded from the bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) data set .    a global analysis with bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) ,",
    "cdhs , and atmospheric constraints excluded from the fit yields a @xmath14-probability of 82% and @xmath1990% compatibility among all experiments .",
    "we have re - examined global fits to sterile neutrino oscillation models , using new data from miniboone . those include the final miniboone neutrino mode results and the first , low statistics miniboone antineutrino results , as well as first results from the off - axis numi beam observed in the miniboone detector .",
    "within a ( 3 + 1 ) cp- and cpt - conserving scenario , we have found that the data set collected by miniboone using the numi off - axis beam ( numi - mb ) currently provides very weak constraints to sterile neutrino fits , due to large systematic uncertainties .",
    "updated numi results , expected soon , should have a greater impact on these fits .    within the same oscillation framework , the miniboone antineutrino data set ( bnb - mb(@xmath16 ) )",
    "is found in agreement with lsnd , yielding , in a combined analysis with lsnd and karmen under a ( 3 + 1 ) oscillation hypothesis , a @xmath14-probability of 29% , and best - fit parameters similar to those of lsnd .",
    "updated miniboone antineutrino appearance results , with almost twice the current statistics , are expected in the near future .",
    "the miniboone neutrino data set ( bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) ) , although suggestive of an excess that could be described by a ( 3 + 1 ) oscillation hypothesis with a @xmath14 probability of 35% , is found incompatible with the signals from the miniboone antineutrino and lsnd results .    the remaining null appearance and disappearance experiments ( numi - mb(@xmath15 ) , karmen , nomad , bugey , chooz , cdhs , ccfr84 ) and atmospheric oscillation data impose strong constraints to the parameter space allowed by a combined ( 3 + 1 ) analysis of miniboone neutrino and antineutrino and lsnd data , excluding the 99% cl allowed region at 99% cl . however , the constraints from antineutrino disappearance experiments on the parameter space allowed by antineutrino appearance experiments ( bnb - mb(@xmath16 ) , lsnd , and karmen ) are weaker . in a ( 3 + 1 ) oscillation framework",
    ", all antineutrino experiments yield a best - fit @xmath14-probability of 86% , and exclude the no - oscillations hypothesis at @xmath195.0@xmath8 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are similar to those of lsnd , and correspond to a muon antineutrino disappearance amplitude of 0.35 , which may be addressed by upcoming results from miniboone and minos on muon antineutrino disappearance .",
    "additionally , fits to all neutrino experiments yield a best - fit @xmath14-probability of 47% and exclude the null hypothesis at @xmath1990% cl .",
    "furthermore , we find that with the addition of the new miniboone data sets , the ( 3 + 2 ) oscillation models provide a much better description of all sbl data sets compared to ( 3 + 1 ) models . in the case of ( 3 + 2 )",
    "fits , cp violation allows for a significant improvement in @xmath14-probability for fits to only bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) + bnb - mb(@xmath16 ) + lsnd , and fits to only appearance experiments . in the case of global fits , however , the effect of cp violation is muted , as allowing for cp violation results in a relatively small improvement in the fit .",
    "the @xmath14-probability for the best - fit ( 3 + 2 ) cpv hypothesis is 54% , compared to 52% for the cpc case .",
    "the best - fit corresponds to large but not maximal cp violation ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the high incompatibility among appearance and disappearance data seen in the past @xcite in the case of ( 3 + 2 ) cp - violating fits still remains with the addition of the new miniboone results .",
    "we have shown that the incompatibility is a result of the bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) and cdhs data sets and atmospheric constraints .",
    "the compatibility between appearance and disappearance data with these three experiments excluded from the fits is significantly higher , at 24% .",
    "neutrino and antineutrino results are also incompatible within a ( 3 + 2 ) cp - violating scenario , with a pg of less than 0.1% .",
    "the compatibility improves to 6.8% in the case of comparing appearance - only neutrino versus antineutrino results .",
    "overall , allowing for mixing with multiple sterile neutrino states and cp violation does not seem sufficient to allow incorporating all sbl experiments within a cpt - conserving , sterile neutrino oscillation framework .",
    "it may be that there is an issue with one or more of the following data sets : lsnd , bnb - mb(@xmath15 ) , including the low - energy excess , cdhs , or atmospheric constraints ; alternatively , theories with cpt - violating oscillations or effective cpt violation @xcite may succeed in reconciling all short - baseline oscillation signatures , and should be explored .",
