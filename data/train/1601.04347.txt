    "although the relic density of dark matter can be determined with high precision , a very important question still remains without answer , what the nature of dark matter is and also which theory is able to explain it considering all recent observations . in this work",
    "we propose a model based on flat extra dimension that is different from the universal extra dimension model in the field propagation  @xcite .",
    "we assume that all the standard model particles are confined to a 3-brane and only a singlet scalar ( and gravity ) can propagate in the @xmath0 space .",
    "the stability of the first nonzero state of the kk tower associated to the singlet scalar is ensured by a remnant u(1)-like symmetry that arises after integrating over the extra dimension .",
    "we calculate the annihilation cross section and spin independent cross section including coannihilation as a function of dark matter mass . also , we show that annihilation and spin independent cross sections of dark matter undergo an increase when we include coannihilation .",
    "we include in our results for annihilation cross section bounds from fermi - lat  @xcite , magic  @xcite , and hess  @xcite and for spin independent cross section bounds from xenon100  @xcite , lux  @xcite , cdmslite  @xcite , cresst  @xcite , and dama / libra  @xcite .",
    "in this work we consider a model based on a modified version of the large extra dimension  @xcite . for our purpose",
    "the scalar sector is composed by the the sm higgs doublet h , and by a real scalar @xmath1 , which is the only field in the model that depends on the extra dimension @xmath2 that is compactified in a circle with radius @xmath3 .",
    "the lagrangian of the scalar sector is divided into three parts  @xcite : @xmath4 where the lagrangian for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 are : @xmath7 where in the unitary gauge : @xmath8 .",
    "the higgs vacuum expectation value is @xmath9 gev and @xmath10 the mass term .",
    "+ due to the circular shape of the extra dimension , the periodic boundary condition for the extra coordinate can be expressed as @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , the field @xmath12 appears in a set of fourier modes , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the kk modes of @xmath12 . in order to obtain the effective lagrangean of the model we integrate over the extra dimension @xmath2 ,",
    "the result is : @xmath16    the kk modes , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are degenerate in mass as we can realize from equation [ eq : lseff1 ] .",
    "hence , we can define @xmath17 it reduces the equation  [ eq : lseff1 ] to : @xmath18    the interaction terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , for example : @xmath21    @xmath22    we can observe that a global @xmath23 symmetry with charges @xmath24 is present in the lagrangian .",
    "so , the lightest kk state , @xmath25 , is stable and therefore it is the dark matter candidate .",
    "the relic density of a dark matter particle is determined by its self - annihilation cross section and also by annihilation processes involving heavier particles .",
    "we consider that it was in thermal equilibrium in the early universe and also decoupled when it was non relativistic . in order to reproduce the correct dark matter relic density we have to solve the boltzmann equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hubble expansion rate ,",
    "@xmath28 is the number density at thermal equilibrium and @xmath29 is the thermally averaged effective cross section for annihilation times the relative velocity .",
    "the effective cross section for our model is given by : @xmath30 ^ 2 } = \\sigma_0 f(x,\\delta_2,n ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the mass splitting between the dm and the _ i_-th kk particles can be written in terms of @xmath31 :",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath31 ranges between 0 and 1 . in this work",
    "we parametrize the mass degeneracy as : @xmath33    in order to be consistent with indirect detection searches that give @xmath34 we find the mass splitting @xmath35 or in terms of number of kk modes @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 shows regions where dm phenomenology is affected by coannihilations ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "in order to compute the theoretical prediction of the relic density of our model we use public software tools lanhep  @xcite and micromegas  @xcite .    figure [ sled_mass ]",
    "shows the mass splitting dependence of the annihilation cross section and the spin independent cross section in terms of mass degeneracy parameter @xmath37 . for lower values of @xmath37",
    "we observe a similar behavior in both cross sections . for @xmath38 , i.e. mass splitting of the order of @xmath39 of the dm mass ,",
    "the cross sections converge to common values : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , this effect is associated to coannihilations . from figure [ sled_mass_pan ]",
    "we observe that points with @xmath42 are in the mass range @xmath43 .    .",
    "both cross sections converge to a fixed value for low values of @xmath37 . ]     versus dm mass .",
    "color scale corresponds to the annihilation cross section value .",
    "bottom - panel : @xmath37 versus dm mass .",
    "color scale corresponds to the value of @xmath44 . ]    in the top panel of figure [ sled_mass_lux ] we show the annihilation cross section as a function of dark matter mass @xmath45 .",
    "the solid red line correponds to the predictions of the inert singlet dm model .",
    "bounds from fermi - lat  @xcite , magic  @xcite , and hess  @xcite are displayed in dashed lines .",
    "the color scale correponds to the value of the degeneracy parameter @xmath37 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath37 lead to enhanced annihilations due to more kaluza klein modes were involved in the early universe . in the bottom panel",
    "we show the spin independent cross section versus the dark matter mass @xmath45 .",
    "bounds from xenon100  @xcite , lux  @xcite , cdmslite  @xcite , cresst  @xcite , and dama / libra  @xcite are also shown .",
    "the color bar indicates the value of @xmath37 where for lower values there is an enhancement of both cross sections due to coannihilations . on the other hand , when @xmath37 is large most of the points fall close to the predictions of the inert singlet dm model .",
    "the model we present in this work allows us to study the effect of coannihilations when several particles are quasi degenerate in mass .",
    "we found that for a degenerate mass spectrum both annihilation and spin independent cross section converge to fixed values @xmath40 and @xmath46 .",
    "this enhancement can be translated to a mass splitting among the kk particles smaller than @xmath47 gev . for larger mass splittings",
    ", the model converges to the predictions of the inert scalar dm model .",
