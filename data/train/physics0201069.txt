    "observations of spatial patterns at various length scales frequently are the only point where the physical world meets theoretical models . in many cases",
    "these patterns consist of a number of comparable objects distributed in space such as pores in a sandstone , or craters on the surface of a planet .",
    "another example is given in figure  [ fig : kerscher_galaxies - circles ] , where we display the galaxy distribution as traced by a recent galaxy catalogue .",
    "the galaxies are represented as circles centered at their positions , whereas the size of the circles mirrors the luminosity of a galaxy . in order to test to which extent theoretical predictions fit the empirically found structures of that type",
    ", one has to rely on quantitative measures describing the physical information .",
    "since theoretical models mostly do not try to explain the structures individually , but rather predict some of their generic properties , one has to adopt a _",
    "statistical point of view _ and to interpret the data as a realization of a random process . in a first step one often confines oneself to the spatial distribution of the objects constituting the patterns and investigates their clustering thereby thinking of it as a realization of a _",
    "point process_. assuming that perspective , however , one neglects a possible linkage between the spatial clustering and the intrinsic properties of the objects .",
    "for instance , there are strong indications that the clustering of galaxies depends on their luminosity as well as on their morphological type . considering figure  [ fig : kerscher_galaxies - circles ]",
    ", one might infer that luminous galaxies are more strongly correlated than dim ones .",
    "effects like that are referred to as _ mark segregation _ and provide insight into the generation and interactions of , e.g. , galaxies or other objects under consideration . the appropriate statistical framework to describe the relation between the spatial distribution of    physical objects and their inner properties are _ marked point processes _ , where discrete , scalar- , or vector - valued marks are attached to the random points .",
    "+ in this contribution we outline how to describe marked point processes ; along that line we discuss two notions of independence ( section  [ sec : kerscher_basic ] ) and define corresponding statistics that allow us to quantify possible dependencies . after having shown that some empirical data sets show significant signals of mark segregation ( section[sec : kerscher_data ] ) , we turn to analytical models , both motivated by mathematical and physical considerations ( section  [ sec : kerscher_models ] ) .",

    "vogel in this volume ) , mark correlations may be relevant .",

    "two - point properties certainly are the simplest non - trivial quantities for homogeneous random processes , but it may be necessary to move on to higher correlations in order to discriminate between certain models .      in the following we will discuss two notions of independence , which may arise for marked point patterns . for this , consider two renaissance families , call them the sforza and the gonzaga .",
    "they used to build castles spread out more or less homogeneously over italy . in order to describe this example in terms of a marked point process",

    "if all the joint @xmath23-point densities factorize into a product of @xmath24-point densities of one type each , then we speak of _ independent sub - point processes_. dependent sub - point processes indicate _ interactions _ between points of different marks ; for instance , the gonzaga may build their castles close to the sforza ones in order to avoid that a region becomes dominated by the other family s castles .",
    "[ [ mark - independent - clustering ] ] mark - independent clustering : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a second type of independence refers to the question whether the different families have different styles to plan their castles .",
    "for instance , the gonzaga may distribute their castles in a grid - like manner over italy , whereas the sforza may incline to build a second castle close to each castle they own .",
    "rather than asking whether two sub - point processes ( namely the gonzaga and the sforza castles , respectively ) are independent ( `` independent sub - point processes '' ) , we are now discussing whether they are _ different _ as regards their statistical clustering properties .",
    "any such difference means that the clustering _ depends _ on the intrinsic mark of a point .",
    "+ whenever the two - point probability density of finding two objects at @xmath14 and @xmath15 depends on the objects intrinsic properties we speak of _ mark - dependent clustering_. it is useful to rephrase this statement by using bayes theorem and the conditional mark probability density @xmath25 in case the spatial product density @xmath26 does not vanish .",
    "@xmath27 is the probability density of finding the marks @xmath16 and @xmath17 on objects located at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , given that there are objects at these points .",
    "clearly , @xmath27 depends only on the pair separation @xmath28 for homogeneous and isotropic point processes .",
    "we speak of _ mark - independent _ clustering , if @xmath29 factorizes @xmath30 and thus does not depend on the pair separation .",
    "that means that regarding their marks , pairs with a separation @xmath31 are not different from any other pairs . on the contrary , mark - dependent clustering or _ mark segregation _",
    "implies that the marks on certain pairs show deviations from the global mark distribution .",
    "+ in order to distinguish between both sorts of independencies , let us consider the case where we are given a map of italy only showing the gonzaga castles . if the distribution of castles in italy can be understood as consisting of independent sub - point processes , we can not infer anything about the sforza castles from the gonzaga ones .",
    "however , if @xmath32 , sforza castles are likely to be found close to gonzaga ones .",
    "here , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the probabilities that a castle belongs to the sforza or gonzaga family .",
    "if , on the other hand , mark - independent clustering applies , typical clustering properties such as the spatial clustering strength are equal for both castle distributions , and the gonzaga castles are in the statistical sense already representative of the whole castle distribution in italy .",
    "that means in particular that , if the gonzaga castles are clustered , so are the sforza ones .",

    "either the different impact objects ( especially their energies ) or the various surface types of the planet may explain the repertory of patterns observed .    whereas the energy variations of impact objects do not cause any peculiarities in the spatial distribution of the craters ( apart from a possible latitude dependence ) , geographic inhomogeneities",

    "crater pairs are disproportionally built up of simple craters at the expense of cross correlations .",
    "this can be explained assuming that crater formation depends on the local surface type : if the simple craters are more frequent in certain geological environments than in others , then there are also more pairs of them to be found as far as one focuses on distances smaller than the typical scale of one geological surface type .",
    "cross pairs are suppressed , since typical pairs with small separations belong to one geological setting where the simple craters either dominate or do not . only a small , positive segregation signal occurs for the complex craters .",
    "hence our analysis indicates that the broad class of complex craters is distributed quite homogeneously over all of the geologies . on top of this",
    "there are probably simple craters , their frequency significantly depending on the surface type .",
    "+ if the ejecta patterns were independent of the surface , no mark segregation could be observed ( other sources of mark segregation are unlikely , since the martian craters are a result of a long bombardment history diluting any eventual peculiar crater correlations ) . in this sense , the signal observed indicates a surface - dependence of crater formation .",
    "this result is remarkable , given that we did not use any geological information on the mars at all .",
    "the picture emerging could be described using the random field model , where a field ( here the surface type ) determines the mark of the points ( see below ) .",
    "+ in a second step , we analyze the interplay between the craters diameters and their spatial clustering .",
    "now the diameter serves as a continuous mark .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig : kerscher_mars - markcorr ] show a clear signal for mark segregation in @xmath133 and @xmath134 at small scales .",
    "the latter signals that pairs with separations in a broad range up to @xmath135 km tend to have similar diameters ; this is in agreement with the earlier picture : as @xcite showed , the simple craters are mostly small - sized .",
    "pairs with relatively small separations thus often stem from the same geological setting and therefore have similar diameters and similar morphological type .",
    "+ also the signal of @xmath133 seems to support this picture : since the simple craters are more strongly clustered than the other ones and since they have smaller diameters , one could expect @xmath136 . as we shall see in sect .",
    "[ sec : kerscher_models ] , however , a @xmath137 contradicts the random field model ; therefore , the mark - dependence on the underlying surface type ( thought of as a random field ) can not account for the signal observed .",
    "thus , we have to look for an alternative explanation : it seems reasonable , that , whenever a crater is found somewhere , no other crater can be observed close nearby ( because an impact close to an existing crater will either destroy the old one or cover it with ejecta such that it is not likely to be observed as a crater ) .",
    "this results in a sort of effective hard - core repulsion .",
    "this repulsion should be larger for larger craters .",
    "thus , pairs with very small separations can only be formed by small craters , therefore @xmath136 for tiny @xmath31 .",
    "the scale beyond which @xmath138 should somehow be hidden within the crater diameter distribution . indeed , at about @xmath139 km the segregation vanishes , which is about twice the largest diameter in our sample .",
    "taking into account that the ejecta patterns extend beyond the crater , this seems to be a reasonable agreement . as shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : kerscher_boolean - depletion ] a model based on these consideration is able to produce such a depletion in the @xmath140 .",
    "this effect could also in turn explain part of the cross correlations observed earlier in figure  [ fig : kerscher_mars - crosscorr ] .",
    "a similar effect is to be expected for the mark variance .",
    "close pairs are only accessible to craters with a smaller range of diameters ; therefore , their variance is diminished in comparison to the whole sample . however , an effect like this is barely visible in the data .",
    "+ altogether , the crater distribution is dominated by two effects : the type of the ejecta pattern and the crater diameter depend on the surface , in addition , there is a sort of repulsion effect on small scales .",
    "now we turn to systems on smaller scales .",
    "sandstone is an example of a porous medium and has extensively been investigated , mainly because oil was found in the pore network of similar stones . in order to extract the oil from the stone one can try to wash it out using a second liquid , e.g. water .",

    "note , that , e.g. , @xmath275 and @xmath276 do not make any difference as regards the mark correlation functions , since the pair averages implicitly render the indices symmetric ; moreover , although the geometrical product is non - commutative , @xmath277 and @xmath278 do not lead to different mark correlation functions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath279 .",
    "@xmath280 provides us with higher moments of the modulus of the vectors . to investigate these kinds of correlations",
    "already scalar marks would be sufficient .",
    "new information is encoded in the other products .",
    "+ consider @xmath281 .",
    "the symmetric part @xmath282 is clearly a scalar and defines the alignment @xmath283 ( eq .  [ eq : kerscher_align ] ) .",
    "the antisymmetric part @xmath284 is a bivector .",
    "its  unique",
    " modulus ( see again @xcite ) , @xmath285 , may be useful , but is no longer a polynomial in the vector components .",
    "@xmath286 appears at the fourth order . in a completely analogous way we can treat @xmath287 .",
    "the symmetric part @xmath288 defines @xmath100 .",
    "hence at second order , the only possible vector - mark correlation functions are @xmath84 and @xmath100 .",
    "3 .   at third order",
    "we have to consider products of three vectors . in general the product of three vectors",
    "@xmath289 splits into @xmath290 i.e. , a vector ( consisting of the three first terms ) , and a pseudo - scalar , a directed volume . in two dimensions the pseudo - scalar @xmath291 vanishes .",
    "+ now we have to form all possible products of the three vectors @xmath129 and to derive scalars . in three dimensions",
    "the only new combination is the pseudo - scalar @xmath292 giving the oriented volume @xmath293 .",
    "unfortunately , this oriented volume averages out to zero .",
    "thus , in a strict sense , there are no interesting third - order quantities .",
    "closely related , however , is the modulus of the pseudoscalar @xmath294 proportional to our @xmath105 .",
    "this expression is invariant under permutations of the vectors .",
    "4 .   at third order and in two dimensions",
    "all of the relevant combinations are products of first- and second - order combinations ; no specifically new combination appears .",
    "this is different from the case of three dimensions , where at third order an entirely new geometric object , the pseudo - scalar @xmath292 can be constructed .",
    "there is a general scheme behind this argument : since in @xmath96 dimensions any geometrical product of more than @xmath96 vectors vanishes , all relevant combinations of vectors at orders higher than @xmath96 are essentially products of combinations of lower - order factors .",
