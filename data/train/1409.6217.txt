    "standard candles and standard rulers have been instrumental in the development of the cosmological model , with type ia  supernovae being used to establish the acceleration of the universe , and the sound horizon at decoupling being used in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) to constrain early universe physics ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can add standard clocks @xcite - objects whose ages are measured independently of the cosmological model , and which were born so early that scatter in formation time is negligible compared to the age of the universe .",
    "the cosmological importance of the bao scale is that it is a key theoretical prediction of models , depending on the sound speed and expansion rate of the universe at early times , before matter and radiation decouple . in combination with lower redshift measurements",
    "this can be used to constrain , for example , the number of relativistic species including neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to provide a measurement of the bao scale , which will survive even if @xmath2cdm does not .",
    "it decouples the physics at @xmath6 from physics at the time when the bao scale is set ( typically @xmath7 ) and allows theoretical models to be confronted with the bao scale independently of assumptions of properties of conventional dark energy . in variants of the standard model ,",
    "this means , for example , that our conclusions about the number of neutrino species rely only on the relatively simple matter- and radiation - dominated physics in the pre - radiation drag era .",
    "other models can be very simply tested against the bao measurement provided only that a theoretical prediction of the scale can be made .",
    "the key link between the standard objects is the hubble parameter , and its dependence on redshift @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scale factor . in this paper , we assume simply the existence of standard objects and an expansion rate , and allow low - redshift data from supernovae and galaxy clustering to constrain weakly the curvature of the universe , without assuming general relativity .",
    "this procedure recovers the expansion history from redshift 0 to 1.3 to a precision of 2.5% ( 11% ) at @xmath10 and provides a weak curvature constraint , but most interestingly , measures the bao scale independently of the cosmological model as @xmath11 mpc ( @xmath12 mpc with clocks ) .",
    "given the importance of the bao scale to cosmology , a measurement independent of all but these very mild assumptions is extremely useful .",
    "optionally adding standard clocks ( passive galaxy ages ) or local hubble parameter measurements allows an absolute bao scale determination ( in mpc ) , and clocks add some statistical power .",
    "we find excellent agreement with the derived quantity of the sound horizon deduced from planck data @xcite , which assumes @xmath13 .",
    "the main difference with other studies that use similar datasets ( e.g. @xcite ) is that here we _ measure _ the standard ruler length , the expansion history , and the curvature simultaneously , without cosmological model assumptions beyond weak requirements on symmetry and smoothness .",

    "our results are insensitive to how we parametrise the expansion history ; setting @xmath84 or @xmath85 , or interpolating in @xmath59 , gives the same @xmath36 and @xmath86 to within a very small fraction of the statistical error .",
    "the results are fairly insensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of different datasets , with a small ( @xmath87 ) decrease in @xmath36 if clocks are included in the analysis .",
    "normally , a cosmological model such as @xmath2cdm is assumed from the big bang to the present day , and data , especially from @xmath88 ( nucleosynthesis ) , @xmath89 ( recombination ) and @xmath6 are used to confront the model .",
    "this cradle - to - the - grave approach is an attractive application of the scientific method , but by determining the bao scale independently of the cosmological model , we are able to isolate near - recombination physics from late - time physics . in doing",
    "so we avoid parameters ( such as @xmath82 ) being pulled away from their correct values by an incorrect model trying to fit the low - redshift data .",
    "if we assume @xmath36 is the sound horizon , the low-@xmath90 measurements limit the scope of new physics to alter the early expansion rate and sound speed - the early universe physics have to give this bao length , regardless of what happens at late times .",
    "the conclusions are independent of assumptions of late - time physics since the cmb can predict @xmath36 independently of late dark energy : odd and even peak heights and silk damping fix the baryon - to - photon ratio , and the amplitudes of the peaks fix the ratio of matter to radiation density@xcite . by importance - sampling the planck chains that vary the effective number of relativistic species @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath5 , which compares with @xmath91 from @xmath2cdm + planck , but our analysis only assumes that the early dynamics are driven by matter and radiation , and late dark energy is irrelevant . varying the helium yield changes @xmath82 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ neff ] ) . allowing this variation",
    "neatly decouples the @xmath89 physics from the @xmath88 physics as well as from the @xmath6 physics - very different epochs , so the conclusions are robust both to changes in very early universe physics and late - time physics .",
    "finally , we note that with precise measurements of @xmath65 , we might hope to detect evolving late - time distortions in the observed ruler length due to redshift distortions and nonlinear effects . however , including a linear gradient of @xmath36 with redshift gives a null result of @xmath94 mpc/(unit z ) , but this may be an interesting future investigation .",
