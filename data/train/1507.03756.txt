    "one of the main challenges of theoretical nuclear physics is the attempt to derive the bulk properties of nuclear systems , which includes the saturation properties of infinite nuclear matter but also the binding energies and size of finite nuclei , from a realistic model of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction . in this",
    "context models of the nn interactions are called realistic if they have been determined to fit the experimental data for 2 nucleons , i.e. the nn scattering phase shifts and the data of the deuteron , with high accuracy .",
    "these so - called realistic nn interactions are in contrast to phenomenological or effective nn forces like the skyrme interactions @xcite or relativistic mean field models@xcite , which are fitted to describe the bulk properties of nuclear systems using hartree - fock or mean - field approximations",
    ".    examples for such realistic nn interactions are the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models of the bonn ( respectively idaho)@xcite group or the local interaction models of the argonne or urbana groups@xcite .",
    "rather sophisticated versions of these models have been developed like the cdbonn potential@xcite or the argonne v18 potential@xcite .",
    "although these potentials are `` soft '' as compared to the hard - core potentials developed in the middle of the last century , they contain strong tensor- and short - range components , which make it inevitable to employ a calculation tool which treats correlations beyond the mean - field or hartree - fock approximation@xcite .",
    "a typical example of such a many - body approach is the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approximation , which is based on the solution of two - nucleon scattering equation in the nuclear medium , leading to an energy- and density dependent effective interaction , the so - called g - matrix .",
    "attempts have been made to compare this g - matrix with the phenomenological models of a nuclear force as the skyrme interaction mentioned above and identify the density dependence of the skyrme interaction with the medium dependence of the g - matrix@xcite .",
    "the variation principle of hartree - fock calculations with density - dependent forces leads to rearrangement terms , which in the case of the skyrme interaction are very important to obtain good agreement with the empirical data for nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "therefore also the bhf approximation has been extended to include such rearrangement terms .",
    "accounting for the energy dependence of g this leads to the renormalized bhf ( rbhf ) approach@xcite whereas the density dependent hf ( dhf ) approximation also accounts for the pauli - rearrangement terms@xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the rearrangement terms is not only justified to simulate the features contained in the effective theory , but , in contrast to bhf , the dhf approach fulfills the hughenholtz van hove theorem due to the inclusion of the rearrangement terms.@xcite    the bhf approach using realistic nn interaction leads to a saturation point for nuclear matter .",
    "the saturation points calculated with various models for the realistic nn interaction form the so - called coester band@xcite , which misses the empirical data in a significant way .",
    "therefore many attempts have been made to explore various effects , which make the nn interaction in the nuclear medium different from the nn interaction in the vacuum .",
    "an example of such studies is the inclusion of sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom e.g. in terms of intermediate excitations of the interacting nucleons to the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "such mutual polarization effects should occur already in the interaction of 2 nucleons in the vacuum .",
    "in fact such processes with intermediate isobar excitations provide a substantial contribution to the medium range attraction of the nn interaction , which in the obe model is described in terms of the exchange of a light scalar @xmath3 meson@xcite . in the nuclear medium these attractive terms",
    "are quenched due to dispersive and pauli effects , features which could be described in terms of a density - dependent nn force or a 3-n interaction@xcite .",
    "such isobar effects turned out to be non - negligible , however , did not cure the problem of the coester band , i.e. did not shift the saturation point calculated for nuclear matter to the empirical data .",
    "another form of medium - dependence of the nn interaction has been supplied by the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approximation@xcite .",
    "here one considers the dirac structure of the self - energy of the nucleon and accounts for the effect that the attractive scalar component of this self - energy yields dirac spinors for the nucleons in the nuclear medium with an enhanced small component as compared to the corresponding spinor for a nucleon in the vacuum . again",
    "this change of the dirac spinors in the medium and the corresponding change for the matrix elements of meson exchange can either be described in terms of a medium - dependent nn force or by means of a 3n force parameterized in form of a z - diagram with 2 @xmath3 exchange terms@xcite .",
    "the dbhf approximation has been successful in the sense that it reproduced the empirical saturation point of nuclear matter without adjustment of any additional parameter@xcite .",
    "since however the consistent treatment of correlation and relativistic effects for finite systems is a rather involved problem , the full dirac brueckner equations have not yet been solved for finite nuclei .",
    "in fact , van giai et al .  @xcite addressed this problem as one of the main open problems in nuclear physics .",
    "different approximation schemes have been developed , which treat either the relativistic effects or the correlation effects in an approximate way .",
    "the most popular approximation scheme is to analyze the dbhf calculations of infinite matter in terms of an effective field theory with meson - nucleon coupling constants depending on the nucleon density and perform relativistic mean field or relativistic hartree - fock calculations for finite nuclei using the semi - phenomenological density functionals , which were adjusted to reproduce dbhf results for infinite matter@xcite .",
    "for a recent discussion of such relativistic density functionals see @xcite and references listed there .",
    "such studies consider the relativistic features of dbhf explicitly , but ignore more or less the effects of correlations beyond the mean field approach .",
    "it has been pointed out that the rearrangement terms originating from the density dependence of the meson - nucleon coupling constants are very important to improve the description of finite nuclei@xcite .    in the present investigation we are going to discuss a different approximation scheme for the dbhf approach in finite nuclei .",
    "the focus is to consider the correlation effects in terms of a direct evaluation for finite nuclei and treat the dirac effects in an approximate way .",
    "however , in contrast to the method developed in @xcite the dirac effects are not described in terms of a local density approximation but are simulated using a three - nucleon interaction .",
    "various attempts have been made to parameterize the 3n forces discussed so far in terms of a simple local 3n force .",
    "as an example we mention the urbana force@xcite , which is composed of two terms @xmath4 the first part is from @xmath5 exchange with an intermediate @xmath6 excitation and may be considered to simulate the medium - dependent isobar effects discussed above . the second term is typically defined in terms of @xmath7 exchange and can be interpreted to simulate the effects of the @xmath8-diagram discussed above .",
    "this means the second term is thought to represent the relativistic effects of the dbhf approach@xcite .",
    "typically this 3n force is reduced to a density - dependent nn interaction , which is then added to the bare nn interaction ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 in eq.([eq:3-v ] ) can be adjusted to reproduce the empirical saturation point for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this scheme has been criticized bey hebeler and schwenk@xcite and later by carbonne et al.@xcite they argue that an expression for the total energy with kinetic energy @xmath11 , 2n interaction @xmath12 and 3n potential @xmath13 @xmath14 leads to the single - particle energy @xmath15 which is different from the result , which is obtained , when the 3n force is added to the 2n interaction by @xmath16 this is of course true and at first sight this would imply that the medium effects discussed above would lead to different results when they are treated in terms of a 3-body force or considered as a density - dependent nn interaction .",
    "we note , however , that both approaches lead to the same result , if the single - particle energies are defined according to the landau definition of the quasiparticle energy , i.e. @xmath17 which means that rearrangement terms due to the density dependence of @xmath18 are taken into account . with this inclusion",
    "the result is the independent on the treatment as a 3n term or a density - dependent 2n contribution .    in this investigation",
    "we will discuss brueckner - hartree - fock kind of calculations for nuclear matter and finite nuclei based on a realistic nn interaction with inclusion of a 3-nucleon force .",
    "special attention will be paid to the rearrangement terms originating from the density dependence of the @xmath19-matrix and the treatment of the 3n force in terms of a density - dependent 2n interaction .",
    "we will show that an adjustment of the constant @xmath10 defining the relativistic 3-body force in ( [ eq:3-v ] ) is sufficient to obtain the empirical saturation point for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the same 3n force leads to a fair description also for the bulk properties of finite nuclei .",
    "after this introduction we will discuss the brueckner hartree fock approach with 3n forces and inclusion of rearrangement terms in section 2 of this paper .",
    "the results for infinite matter and finite nuclei are discussed in section 3 .",
    "special attention will be paid to the treatment of the 3n force in finite nuclei and the description of the particle state spectrum in the bethe - goldstone equation .",
    "the main results and conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the brueckner hartree fock ( bhf ) approach can be defined in terms of three central equations .",
    "the first one of these equations is the bethe - goldstone equation @xmath20 defining the so - called @xmath19 matrix in terms of the free - space nn interaction @xmath21 . replacing the pauli operator @xmath22 ,",
    "which forbids the scattering of the interacting nucleons into states , which are below the fermi energy and therefore occupied by other nucleons by the unit operator and the energy denominator @xmath23 by the difference of kinetic energies of free nucleons , the @xmath19 matrix turns over into the lippman schwinger equation defining the scattering matrix @xmath24 for two nucleons in the vacuum .",
    "therefore the bethe - goldstone equation can be interpreted as the solution of the problem of two nucleons interacting in the nuclear medium and the @xmath19 matrix can be understood as the effective interaction of two nucleons , which accounts for correlation between the interacting nucleons .",
    "the single - particle energies are then defined within the standard bhf using the hartree - fock expression in terms of the @xmath19-matrix interaction @xmath25 the single - particle density @xmath26 is diagonal in the basis of hartree - fock states @xmath27 and the diagonal elements @xmath26 take the values 1 for occupied hole states with energies @xmath28 below the fermi energy and 0 for the particle states above the fermi level . in the case of finite nuclei",
    "these hartree fock states have to be determined as the eigenstates of the bhf single - particle hamiltonian , which corresponds to the single - particle energies defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhfeps ] ) . in the case of infinite nuclear matter",
    "these single - particle states are plane waves due to the symmetry of the system under translational transformation .",
    "note , however that also in the case of infinite matter a self - consistent solution of the bethe - goldstone equation ( [ eq : betheg ] ) and the evaluation of the single - particle energies according eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhfeps ] ) is required to determine the starting energy @xmath29 according to the bethe - brandow - petchek theorem .    after solving eqs.([eq : betheg ] ) and ( [ eq : bhfeps ] ) in a self - consistent way one can evaluate the total energy as @xmath30 which is the third of the 3 equations to define the bhf approximation .",
    "note that using the bhf definition of the single - particle energies ( [ eq : bhfeps ] ) the corresponding expression for the total energy leads to koltuns sum rule@xcite @xmath31    the definition of the single - particle energies for the intermediate particle states , i.e. the definition of the operator @xmath32 in the propagator of the bethe - goldstone eq.([eq : betheg ] ) has been discussed for many years .",
    "it has been shown by song et al.@xcite that the contribution from three - body correlations is minimized in nuclear matter with the so - called continuous prescription @xcite , which means that the single - particle energies for the states above the fermi level are calculated in the same way as those for the hole states below . as will be discussed below",
    ", we will try to adopt this prescription in our calculations .",
    "since it is very elaborate to evaluate the single - particle energies for all states in finite nuclei , we will approximate the hamiltonian for the two particle states in this case by @xmath33 which is the operator of the kinetic energy of the interacting particles restricted to the states above the fermi energy .",
    "a constant @xmath34 is introduced to make the spectrum `` continuous '' across the fermi energy .",
    "appropriate values will be discussed below .",
    "another rather technical obstacle for the solution of the bethe - goldstone eq.([eq : betheg ] ) is the definition of the pauli operator @xmath22 .",
    "this pauli operator is easily defined for nuclear matter using the rest - frame of the nuclear matter system by @xmath35 with @xmath36 denoting the momenta of the interacting nucleons and the fermi momentum @xmath37 .",
    "the bethe - goldstone equation , however , is more easily solved in the center of mass frame of the interacting nucleon , as the momentum of the center of mass is conserved and the relative momentum can be expanded in a partial wave basis .",
    "therefore one typically employs the so - called angle - average approximation for the pauli operator and approximates the single - particle spectrum by a quadratic form @xmath38 with an effective mass @xmath39 and a constant @xmath40 fitted to describe the single - particle spectrum for the states below the fermi momentum . using these approximations ,",
    "the bethe - goldstone equation can be solved separately in each partial wave , which reduces the numerical effort drastically .",
    "methods have been developed to treat the pauli operator and the single - particle spectrum without these approximations@xcite and it has been shown that the angle - average in the pauli operator is a reasonable approximation , while the parameterization of the single - particle spectrum according to eq.([effmas ] ) can lead to considerable differences , as we will also discuss below .",
    "the problem of a precise treatment of the two - particle propagator is even more pronounced in calculation of finite nuclei , as the single - particle states are only defined after the corresponding hartree - fock equations have been solved . since we are using the simple parameterization of eq.([eq : h20 ] ) for the single - particle spectrum , we avoid a precise treatment for the pauli operator ( see e.g.@xcite ) and use the so - called angle - average for finite nuclei@xcite for a basis of oscillator states , which is appropriate for the nucleus under consideration .",
    "the single - particle states @xmath41 states are expanded in the very same oscillator basis @xmath42 @xmath43 assuming spherical symmetry of the states for the closed - shell nuclei considered .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 refer to the orbital and total angular momenta of the single - particle states and the projection quantum numbers for the angular momentum are dropped .",
    "an attempt is made to optimize the oscillator basis in the sense that the oscillator parameter is chosen such that the corresponding expansion coefficients @xmath46 are close to 1 for all occupied single - particle states . in this way",
    "it is typically sufficient to restrict the expansion in eq.([eq : hoexpan ] ) to radial quantum numbers @xmath47 .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath46 can then be determined by solving the bhf equations , which are given in the oscillator representation by @xmath48 with @xmath49 the matrix elements for the kinetic energy in the basis of oscillator states and the corresponding matrix elements for the bhf single - particle potential , which can be calculated as    @xmath50    with the anti - symmetrized matrix - elements of the @xmath19-matrix @xmath51 in the basis of two - nucleon oscillator states coupled to total angular momentum @xmath52 .",
    "the non - linear equations ( [ eq : hfequa ] ) and ( [ eq : hfequa1 ] ) are solved in an iterative way to obtain self - consistent solutions for the expansion coefficients @xmath53 as well as single - particle energies @xmath54 of the bhf single - particle states .",
    "the effects of the 3n interaction are taken into account using a density - dependent 2n interaction as it is indicated in eq.([eq : v3dens ] ) note , however , that the weighting coefficients of this density - dependent 2n interaction have been adjusted to obtain the correct expressions for the total energy and single - particle energies as presented in eqs.([eq:3n1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3n2 ] ) , respectively .      the bhf approximation , which has briefly been sketched in the preceding subsection , corresponds to a hartree - fock calculation , replacing the two - particle interaction by the corresponding @xmath19-matrix .",
    "the @xmath19-matrix , however , must be understood as an effective interaction , due to its dependence on the starting energy @xmath29 and the pauli operator , depends on the density operator of the system considered .",
    "therefore the bhf definition of the single - particle energy does not obey the landau definition of the quasiparticle energy in ( [ eq : landaud ] ) .",
    "in fact , applying the landau prescription to the energy functional ( [ eq : tote ] ) one obtains the bhf terms of ( [ eq : bhfeps ] ) plus two additional terms , the starting energy rearrangement term @xmath55 and the pauli rearrangement term @xmath56 , which are due to the dependence of @xmath19 on starting energy @xmath29 and pauli operator @xmath57 .",
    "the starting energy rearrangement term can be written @xmath58 the second line of this equation is obtained by substituting @xmath28 in the first line by the corresponding bhf definition of the single - particle energy .",
    "note that adding @xmath55 to the bhf definition of the single - particle energy leads to @xmath59 which means that we have replaced the single - particle density @xmath26 in eq.([eq : bhfeps ] ) by @xmath60\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : occupation}\\ ] ] this expression for @xmath61 typically yields values of the order of @xmath62 and is often interpreted as a partial occupation of states @xmath45 below the fermi energy .",
    "the approximation ( [ eq : rbhf1 ] ) represents the leading terms of the so - called renormalized bhf approach ( rbhf ) @xcite",
    ". therefore we will use this name also in the following .",
    "note that the koltun sum - rule of ( [ eq : koltun ] ) can not be used any longer to evaluate the total energy ( [ eq : tote ] ) using the rbhf definition of the single - particle energy .",
    "the pauli rearrangement term can be written as @xmath63 and corresponds to the term of second order in @xmath19 in the hole - line expansion of the self - energy .",
    "calculations including pauli- and starting energy rearrangement terms will be denoted as density - dependent hartree - fock calculations ( dhf ) and employ single - particle energies of the form @xmath64",
    "all the calculations presented here have been performed using the proton - neutron part of the charge - dependent bonn interaction ( cd bonn ) , which has been defined and adjusted to the 2-nucleon data by machleidt , sammarruca and song@xcite .",
    "results of conventional bhf calculations for symmetric nuclear matter , using the angle - average approximation for the pauli operator and the parameterization of the single - particle potential using the quadratic form of eq.([effmas ] ) are presented by the dashed line , labeled bhf aa , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucmat1 ] .",
    "the single - particle potential , which is displayed in the left panel of this figure for a fermi momentum @xmath37 of 1.36 @xmath65 , which corresponds to the empirical saturation density , reflects the quadratic parameterization , which is adjusted to reproduce the bhf single - particle potential @xmath66 for momenta @xmath67 below the fermi momentum and extended to momenta above @xmath37 .    the calculated binding energy per nucleon of such bhf aa calculations , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucmat1 ] , yield a minimum , representing the prediction for the saturation point , at about twice the empirical saturation density and an energy of around -20 mev , which is much more attractive than the empirical value of -16 mev .    the consistent treatment of the two - particle propagator in the bethe - goldstone eq.([eq : betheg ] ) , avoiding the angle - average of the pauli operator and using a consistent single - particle spectrum , leads to quite different results as can be observed from a comparison of the bhf results , presented by the red solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucmat1 ] and the bhf aa results .",
    "as it has been discussed by schiller et al.@xcite , these differences can mainly be attributed to the definition of the single - particle potential . as can be seen from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucmat1 ] , the single - particle energies used to define the propagator of the bethe - goldstone equation are quite similar for momenta below @xmath37 . for the particle states with momenta above @xmath37",
    ", however the calculated bhf energies are more attractive than described by the quadratic parameterization of the bhf aa approach .",
    "the corresponding differences in the two - particle propagator lead to matrix elements of @xmath19 , which are in general more attractive in the bhf than in the bhf aa approach , which leads to more binding energy in the former as compared to the latter calculation . this can be seen from the energy as a function of density curves , presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucmat1 ] .",
    "the bhf calculations yield a saturation point with even larger binding energy ( -24 mev ) than the bhf aa approach at a larger saturation density .",
    "[ fig : nucmat1 ] also provides the relevant information about the effects of the rearrangement terms in the definition of the single - particle potential in eqs.([eq : rbhf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dhf1 ] ) .",
    "the dominant contribution arises from the starting energy rearrangement term , @xmath68 , which is taken into account using the rbhf approximation . as to be expected from the representation of the rbhf energies in terms of the partial occupation probabilities defined in ( [ eq : occupation ] )",
    "these are less bound than the corresponding bhf single - particle energies .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the states with momenta below @xmath37 than for the particle states above the fermi momentum .",
    "this enhances the calculated binding energy even more , leading to a saturation point with an energy per nucleon of less than -25 mev at a fermi momentum of @xmath37 of 1.8 @xmath65 , which corresponds to a saturation density 2.3 times the empirical value .",
    "the pauli rearrangement term , which is also included in the dhf approximation , has a small effect .",
    "its main effect in the single - particle potential is concentrated at momenta around the fermi momentum , where it leads to a reduction of the momentum dependence of @xmath66 .",
    "this corresponds to the enhancement of the effective mass @xmath39 to the bare mass @xmath69 , as it has already been discussed e.g. by mahaux and sartor@xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the weak contribution of the pauli rearrangement effect is also reflected in the small difference of the energies calculated in the dhf as compared to rbhf approximation .",
    "all the calculations discussed so far have been performed assuming just a realistic two - nucleon interaction , only , here the cd bonn interaction , and we find , that the results of the calculated saturation points are part of the so - called coester band@xcite .",
    "this is true for the bhf approach and the rearrangement terms just provide a shift along this coester band . as it is one of the main goals of this investigation , to simulate the relativistic effects in terms of a 3n potential , we considered the 3n part of the urbana interaction model@xcite fix the parameter @xmath9 in eq.([eq:3-v ] ) to be equal zero and adjust the parameter @xmath10 , the strength parameter for the term to simulate the change of the dirac spinors in the medium , to reproduce the empirical saturation point .",
    "we did not aim at a high - precision fit , but just tried to obtain results close to the experimental data .",
    "results of such calculations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucmat2 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that we can obtain a good description of the empirical saturation point by adjusting only one parameter , whereas most of the other attempts employ consider a 3 nucleon interaction with 2 or more parameters for a corresponding fit .",
    "the 3n term @xmath70 ( see eq.([eq:3-v ] ) ) , which we consider in our studies , is of shorter range than the corresponding 2@xmath71 exchange term , @xmath72 .",
    "this may be the reason that the 3n term essentially provides a repulsive shift in the single - particle potential @xmath66 with almost no momentum dependence ( see the example in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucmat2 ] ) .",
    "so we do not obtain the strong momentum dependence which has been observed by zuo et al.@xcite .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "an attempt has been made to simulate the relativistic features of the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach by adding effects of a simple 3 nucleon ( 3n ) force to non - relativistic many - body calculations based on the bhf approach .",
    "one parameter , the strength of the 3n force , is adjusted to reproduce the empirical saturation point of infinite nuclear matter and than used without further modifications for the description of finite nuclei .",
    "special attention is paid to the energy spectrum of particle states , which is used in the propagator of the bethe - goldstone equation , and the importance of rearrangement terms due to the energy dependence of the effective interaction . for the studies of finite nuclei in particular more effort",
    "is needed to optimize the treatment of the propagator in the bethe - goldstone equation .",
    "taking a reasonable choice for the particle state spectrum and including the effects of rearrangement terms the renormalized brueckner hartree fock calculations with 3n force can reproduce the empirical values for the energy and radius of charge distribution of nuclei like @xmath0o and @xmath1ca .",
    "this attempt to simulate the effects of the relativistic features of dbhf , however , fails to reproduce other predictions of the dirac phenomenology like the strength of the spin - orbit term in the single - particle field .",

    "<S> in order to simulate the relativistic effects of the dirac brueckner hartree fock approach for finite nuclei the part of the urbana 3 nucleon ( 3n ) force is considered , which represents the enhancement of the small components of the dirac spinors for the nucleons in the nuclear medium . this 3n force </S>",
    "<S> is included in a brueckner hartree fock calculation with rearrangement terms using a realistic model for the nn interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the 3n force is adjusted to reproduce the empirical saturation point of nuclear matter and then used in corresponding studies of the closed shell nuclei @xmath0o and @xmath1ca . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to a consistent treatment of the spectrum of particle states in the nn propagator of the bethe - goldstone equation . </S>"
