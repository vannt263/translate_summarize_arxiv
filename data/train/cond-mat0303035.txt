    "investigation of electron spectrum in quantum dots has been attracted much attention in the last decade as it has been technologically possible to produce well characterized quasi - zero - dimensional structures .",
    "the energy spectrum depens on the physical papameters of the quantum dot s material , its shape and size . also , the important factor influenses on the electron spectrum in polar semiconductor is interaction between electrons and longitudinal optical lo phonons . in low - dimesional structures",
    "the importance of polaron effects increases .",
    "so , the knowledge of the polaron energy spectrum is important for understanding the infrared properties of quantum dots .",
    "one of the interesting experimental facts is the absence of the lo phonon bottleneck effect of photoexcited electrons .",
    "there is a number of papers proposed various reasons why the expected bottleneck effect may be bypassed [ 1 - 3 ] . in particular , in the works",
    "[ 4,5 ] the energy relaxation of the excited electrons in quantum dots was discussed in connection with polaron effects .",
    "so , it is interesting to investigate polaron spectrum in quantum dots in the region where the distance between size - quantized leves equals to the lo - phonon energy .    in magneto - optical experiments in bulk crystals",
    "the electron - lo - phonon interaction leads to anticrossing of the energy levels .",
    "larsen was the first to point out the level repulsion at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath2 is the frequency of lo- phonon [ 6].the anticrossing of energy levels was observed in absorption spectrum of quantum dots @xmath3 in magnetic field in the work [ 7 ] .",
    "appearance of the anticrossing in the dependence of polaron levels on the quantum dot radius theoretically was derived on the base of two - levels system [ 5 ] .",
    "however , in order to obtain more correct expressions for the polaron energy shift it is necessary to take into account the influence of the all size - quantized levels . in present paper we consider an optical weak - coupling polaron at low temperature in a cylindrical quantum dot .",
    "an analytical expression for the polaron energy shift is obtained using a modified perturbation theory .",
    "in the present paper we consider a disc shape quantum dot , i.e. a cylindrical quantum dot with the radius essentially exceeding the height .",
    "the same situation usually is realized in experiments .",
    "usually the diameter of the disc exceeds its heigt by the order . besides , we use the oscillator model of the potential confining electron s movement along the cylindrical axis @xmath4 with the frequency @xmath5 and in the plane of the disk with the frequency @xmath6 . according to the cosidered shape of the disc it is assumed that @xmath7 . it is considered that the levels connected with confinement along @xmath4 are situated too over the ground state and their influence",
    "can be neglected .",
    "it is suggested that the coupling constant of a polar crystal in a quantum dot is too little ( for @xmath8 @xmath9 ) . in this connection",
    "we use the perturbation theory for polaron energy shift . the suggested model of the quantum dot",
    "is related to the following schrdinger equation for electron noninteracting with phonons    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is electron s effective mass in the quantum dot , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath4 are the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the solution of the equation ( 1 ) is well known    @xmath14    where @xmath15 are the associated laguerre polynomials , @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 if @xmath21 is even , @xmath22 if @xmath21 is odd and @xmath23 for @xmath24 ) .",
    "the energy spectrum is :    @xmath25    the electrons are assumed to be coupled to dispersionless lo - phonons of the bulk crystal .",
    "the potential yielded by one lo - phonon is    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the phonon wavevector , @xmath29and @xmath30 are the components of the phonon wavevector laying in the plane of the disc and along @xmath4 axes correspondingly , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the energy of lo phonon at @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the quantum dot s volume .",
    "the matrix element corresponding to the emission of the lo phonon is    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the electron charge . using the expressions ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) we obtain    @xmath38    where @xmath39 @xmath40 is the bessel function .",
    "it is assumed that the difference between conductivity bands of the material of quantum dot and surroundings is quite large and a sufficient number of the quantum levels can exist inside the quantum well . therefore , while calculating the polaron energy , we shall take into account the electron s transitions to the all levels .",
    "far from the resonance @xmath41 , the polaron correction to the energy in the second order of the perturbation theory is defined as follows :    @xmath42    the expression ( 7 ) differs from the one , usually being used for calculation of a correction to the ground state , by the additional sum over degenerate states of the level @xmath43 ( summation over @xmath44 ) .",
    "we shall substitute ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) in ( 7 ) and replace the summation over @xmath45 with integration . for simplicity",
    "we shall consider the limit @xmath46 related to the case of zero height cylinder . according to this limit",
    "the integral over @xmath30 is equal to :    @xmath47    as a result we shall obtain the following expression of the polaron energy shift normalized by @xmath48 :    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 . as the parameter @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the quantum dot radius , the limit @xmath55 corresponds to the ultraquantum limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the limit @xmath56 corresponds to the two - dimensional case of a plane .",
    "the polaron energy shift of the ground state @xmath57 calculated as a function of the parameter @xmath52 is plotted in fig.1 .",
    "the quantity of @xmath58 trends to the well known value @xmath59 for two - dimensional case in the limit @xmath60 in the case of @xmath55 the quantity of @xmath61 diverges proportionally to @xmath62 .",
    "it is known that the divergence is taken place also in the case of a quantum wire if the wire radius tends to zero [ 8 ] . however , in one - dimensional case there is more weak logarithmic divergence .",
    "now we shall calculate the polaron energy shift of the level @xmath63 for any value of @xmath52 including the resonace region . as it is seen from the expression ( 9 ) for @xmath64 , the term corresponding to @xmath65diverges in the limit @xmath66 .",
    "the formula ( 9 ) is not applicable near the resonance @xmath67 . in order to calculate the energy shift of the level @xmath63 in this area we shall exclude from ( 9 ) the term corresponding to the transition from the state @xmath64 to @xmath68 and shall take into account this contribution using the perturbation theory applicable in the case of degeneracy of two levels @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we shall consider the system consisted from an electron , which has the state @xmath71 of the level @xmath72 and two degenerate states @xmath73 of the level @xmath63 , and a phonon which will have the occupation number @xmath74 if the electron is on the level @xmath75 and @xmath76 if the electron is on the level @xmath69 .",
    "so , the united noninteracting electron - phonon system may exist on the level @xmath63 with two degenerate states @xmath77 and on the level @xmath78 with the state @xmath79 . then including the frhlich coupling one can easy obtain the following expression for the energy of the two - level system :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .    from ( 9 ) we can define @xmath84 in the following form :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 .",
    "the sign plus corresponds to the region @xmath87 , the sign minus to the region @xmath88 .",
    "the contribution into the energy shift @xmath89 corresponding to the same transition is defined by the formula ( 11 ) , but with the sign plus in the region @xmath90 and with the sign minus in the region @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath91    the value of the integral @xmath92is @xmath93 .    the total shift @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    "is calculated excluding from ( 9 ) the term related to the transition @xmath96 and adding the contribution defined by ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) respectively .",
    "the shifts @xmath94 and @xmath97 as the functions of @xmath52 are plotted in fig.2 and fig.3 respectively for @xmath98 .",
    "it is seen from fig.2 and fig.3 that @xmath99 .",
    "the picture of the levels @xmath100 and @xmath101 is represented in fig.4 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are represented by the dashed lines . in the resonance area of the energy levels",
    "the corresponding wave function are represented as a superposition of the states @xmath77 and @xmath104 .",
    "using the perturbation theory the polaron energy shift was obtained .",
    "the polaron shift of ground state tends to the well known value @xmath59 for two - dimensional system in the case of @xmath105 in the limit of @xmath55 the polaron shift diverges more sharp than in the case of quantum wire .",
    "when its radius tends to zero .    using the modified perturbation theory the anticrossing of the polaron levels @xmath106and @xmath107",
    "was obtained near the resonance region .    the picture like the one plotted in fig.4",
    "was obtained in experimental dependence of polaron spectrum on the magnetic field directed along axes @xmath4 of the cylindrical quantum dots [ 7 ] . in the presence of magnetic field",
    "the derived formulas are the same with substitution of @xmath6 by @xmath108 .",
    "the role of the parameter @xmath52 will play the magnitude @xmath109 .",
    "note that the splitting of the levels @xmath106 and @xmath107 in light absorption experiment will be observed also in the absence of magnetic field if @xmath6 @xmath110 . besides the allowed transition @xmath111 @xmath106",
    ", the transition @xmath112 @xmath107 may also take place because the wave functions of these levels are mixed in the anticrossing region .",
    "far from the resonance the level @xmath107 has not the particular physical meaning , however , the states corresponding to this level in the resonance region may be realized in experiments on light absorption ."
