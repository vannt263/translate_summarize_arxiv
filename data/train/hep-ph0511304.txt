    "during this talk i would like to present the work which was performed about one year ago in collaboration with g. korchemsky and a. manashov @xcite .",
    "this work describes the way one can calculate the anomalous dimensions of qcd making use of the reggeized gluon states , reggeons .",
    "this approach was first used in 1980 by jaroszewicz @xcite who calculated anomalous dimensions coming from @xmath1 reggeon state corresponding to twist @xmath2 .",
    "later , the cases for higher twists with @xmath1 were computed by lipatov @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we performed calculation for reggeon states with @xmath3 .    in order to present the calculation , firstly , i will explain briefly what the reggeized gluons are .",
    "next , i will describe the way one can relate them to the anomalous dimensions in qcd .",
    "finally , i will show you our results .",
    "let us consider the deep inelastic scattering of hadron , @xmath4 , off virtual photon , @xmath5 , where the bjrken @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the regge limit of small @xmath9 : @xmath10 resuming appropriate feynman diagrams one can formulate an effective field theory in which compound states of gluons , reggeized gluons , play a role of a new elementary field .    in the limit ( [ eq : reglim ] ) the leading contribution to",
    "the structure function of hadron @xmath11 comes from the reggeons with total angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the structure function can be expanded in terms of the moments @xmath13 with the strong coupling constant @xmath14 , where @xmath15 in the above formula the impact factors @xmath16 are the overlaps between the reggeon wave - function @xmath17 and the wave - functions of the scattering particles .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 correspond to transverse reggeon coordinates and are integrated out in the scalar product ( [ eq : impf ] ) defined in ( [ eq : sp ] ) . in order to find the quantized values of @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "one has to solve the schrdinger - like equation @xmath21 which was first formulated for @xmath1 reggeons by balitsky , fadin , kuraev and lipatov @xcite and later generalized for @xmath22 reggeon by bartels , kwieciski , praszaowicz and jaroszewicz @xcite .",
    "it turns out that after performing the multi - colour limit @xcite eq .",
    "( [ eq : schr ] ) corresponds to the schrdinger equation of the non - compact heisenberg @xmath23 spin chain magnet model @xcite where the @xmath19 plays a role of the total energy .",
    "the system becomes integrable with the complete set of the integrals of motion @xmath24 that are also called conformal charges .",

    "the quantity @xmath19 is also called the reggeon energy",
    ". the eigenvalue of the lowest conformal charge , @xmath27 , may be parametrized by @xmath28 where in qcd @xmath29 are the complex spins of reggeons and @xmath30 define a spin of @xmath31-reggeon state @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hn ] ) is invariant under @xmath23 group transformation @xmath35 and its eigenstates transform as @xmath36    in order to solve ( [ eq : schr ] ) we use an algorithm based on the @xmath37baxter method @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting , however , complicated and the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "due to the scaling symmetry of the reggeon states ( [ eq : psitr ] ) one can calculate the dimensions of the impact factors as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are dimensionless constants . substituting ( [ eq : dimif ] ) into ( [ eq : fmom2 ] ) one obtains @xmath41 where integer @xmath42 and @xmath43 enumerate the quantized values of conformal charges @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the integral over @xmath45 is calculated by performing analytical continuation of @xmath46 into the complex @xmath47plane , closing the integral contour in infinity and summing the residua inside the contour at @xmath48 defined by the condition @xmath49 thus , the moment of the structure function for @xmath12 is given by @xmath50 the above formula will help us to relate the reggeized gluon states to the anomalous dimensions .    on the other hand the moments of @xmath11 can be expanded in inverse powers of the hard scale @xmath51 , in the twist series , as @xmath52 which is also called operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the wilson operators , @xmath53 , satisfy @xmath54 where @xmath55 enumerates operators with the same twist and the anomalous dimensions may be expanded as @xmath56 in the limit @xmath12 the moment @xmath57 takes a form @xmath58 now we are ready to compare the exponents in ( [ eq : twser ] ) and ( [ eq : mom5 ] ) that results in @xmath59/2\\ , .",

    "moreover , it turns out that the position of the energy poles : @xmath68 determines the twist @xmath69 : @xmath70",
    "after performing the analytical continuation of @xmath46 in complex @xmath47space the reggeon wave functions @xmath71 is no more normalizable with respect to the scalar product @xmath72 moreover , the quantization conditions for @xmath20 become relaxed , so that @xmath73      for @xmath1 reggeon states the energy @xcite in known analytically @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "it is an analytical function on the complex @xmath47plane without the branching points and with poles at @xmath76 .",
    "the leading twist @xmath2 , which agrees with ( [ eq : tw ] ) , corresponds to the pole at @xmath77 , while the anomalous dimension @xcite @xmath78      for more than @xmath1 reggeons the energy @xmath79 is a multi - valued function with the branching point in the complex @xmath47plane where the cuts take a form @xmath80 poles at @xmath81 with twist @xmath82 .",

    "[ cc][cc]@xmath85 [ cc][bc]@xmath86 [ cc][bc]@xmath87    4.5 cm 4.5 cm    let us consider the case for @xmath83 and @xmath84 where @xmath88 with @xmath89 what gives a condition @xmath90 .",
    "the spectral surfaces @xmath91 in this case along real and imaginary axes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] . on the left panel",
    "the energy @xmath92 is a monotonic function of real @xmath45 .",
    "however , on the right panel , for imaginary values of @xmath45 , branching points , denoted by open circles , appear .",
    "they glue together surfaces with the same quantum numbers .",
    "they appear not only for purely imaginary @xmath45 but also for complex @xmath45 .",
    "however , one can notice that contribution to the structure function from the cuts cancel each other so the ( ope ) expansion in not broken .",
    "the poles of @xmath93 are localized at @xmath94 which gives possible values of the twists @xmath95 .",
    "the leading twist @xmath96 in this sector comes from the poles at @xmath97 where @xmath98 which gives the anomalous dimension @xmath99    the energy around the other poles reads as follows @xmath100 and can be generally cast in the form : @xmath101 where @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 for _ even _",
    "@xmath104 ) and @xmath105 is energy of the heisenberg model with @xmath106 spin .",
    "making use of ( [ eq : eser ] ) and ( [ eq : gam2 ] ) one can calculate expansion coefficients of anomalous dimensions corresponding to ( [ eq : elast ] ) .",
    "another interesting case for @xmath83 reggeon states is when @xmath108 and @xmath107 .",
    "such states are called descendent of @xmath1 states because they possess the same quantum numbers as @xmath1 reggeon states and the energy @xmath109 as a function of @xmath45 does not have branching points and its poles are situated at @xmath110 with twists @xmath111 . according to ( [ eq : tw ] ) this case is related to @xmath1 case which gives one more argument to call them descendent .",
    "the leading twist , @xmath112 , corresponds to the energy pole where @xmath113 so that in this case the anomalous dimension @xmath114      for higher @xmath31 the leading twist @xmath115 .",
    "however , considering _ even _ and _ odd _",
    "@xmath31 s separately one can notice that the leading twist comes from completely different sectors .",
    "for _ even _ @xmath31 it corresponds to the pole at @xmath116 localized in the sector where @xmath84 .",
    "the energy pole residuum equals to @xmath117 that gives anomalous dimensions @xmath118 with the twist @xmath115 .    for _ odd _",
    "s in the sector with @xmath84 the minimal twist @xmath119 corresponds to the energy pole at @xmath120 .",
    "for example , for @xmath121 we have @xmath122 however , the real leading twist comes from the sector of descendent states with @xmath107 and it corresponds to the pole at @xmath116 , @xmath123 as one can see , the pole residuum in this case has a more complicated form .    in each case the energy pole which gives the leading twist is situated on the same surface as the state with the minimal energy @xmath93 where @xmath124 .",
    "in this work following ref .  @xcite we have considered the deep inelastic scattering processes of hadrons described by means of the reggeized gluon states . expanding the structure function ( [ eq : fmom ] ) we have used two approaches .",
    "firstly , we have expanded the structure function ( [ eq : fmom ] ) making use of the reggeized gluon states which was possible due to the analytical continuation of the reggeon energy @xmath93 into complex @xmath47plane .",
    "secondly , we have performed ( ope ) expansion ( [ eq : twser ] ) with evolution equation ( [ eq : evol ] ) , which defines the anomalous dimensions of qcd . comparing exponents of these two series",
    "we have found relation between @xmath125 and @xmath0reggeon states .",
    "since we are able to solve numerically the bkp equation @xcite for @xmath0reggeon states with @xmath126 , we have calculated anomalous dimensions and the twist coming from these states .",
    "contrary to @xmath1 reggeon case for @xmath127 the energy @xmath93 is a multi - valued function of complex @xmath45 parameter defined on complex riemann surface with the infinite number of branching points that glue the surfaces with the same quantum numbers .",
    "however , similarly to @xmath1 case , the energy has poles only for purely imaginary @xmath45 and their position defines the possible values of the twist ( [ eq : tw ] ) .",
    "fitting expansion coefficients of the energy in the vicinity of these poles we have calculated the anomalous dimensions of qcd .",
    "it turns out that the leading twist @xmath69 coming from the @xmath0reggeon states is equal to a number of reggeized gluons @xmath31 .",
    "however , we have to consider the states with _ even _ @xmath31 and the states with _ odd _ @xmath31 separately . for _",
    "even _ @xmath31 the leading twist comes from the sector where @xmath84 , whereas for _ odd _ @xmath31 the minimal twist comes from the sector of descendent states with @xmath107 .    to sum up",
    "i would like to notice that contrary to common approaches @xcite the present work goes beyond the leading order of the twist expansion of the structure function and describes contributions with non - leading asymptotics that correspond to the higher twists .",
