    "basic pulsar electrodynamics involves a definition of the open field lines , which close outside the light cylinder , so that a polar cap potential drop @xmath3 is in excess of @xmath4 ev , where @xmath5 is the surface field strength and @xmath6 the pulsar period .",
    "the goldreich julian pulsar current from the polar cap scales similarly as @xmath7 ) , and is responsible for the extraction of electrons and possibly fe ions from the surface of the polar cap , where a component of the electric field parallel to @xmath8 exists .",
    "the product of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is then comparable to the magnetic dipole spindown power .",
    "it is therefore natural to follow the curvature @xmath0-ray emission from accelerated electrons above the polar cap , resulting in a cone - like beam of @xmath0-ray emission above the polar cap until magnetic pair production no longer dominates the pair production process .",
    "daugherty & harding ( 1996 ) were able to reproduce the observed pulse profiles and spectra for such processes , but a natural consequence of the polar cap process is a super exponential cutoff of the spectrum as discussed by nel & de jager ( 1995 ) .    in competition with the polar cap model ,",
    "is the so - called outergap model , whereby a potential drop may develop around the @xmath11 `` null surface '' , which is at a much larger distance from the pulsar compared to the polar cap emission region .",
    "spectra can be self - consistently derived for outer gaps ( hirotani 2001 ) , but it remains to be shown how the outergap geometry can be unified with the electrodynamics . in this case",
    "we find that photon - photon pair production and the available acceleration potential determines the cutoff .",
    "both a synchrotron and a much higher energy inverse compton component can then escape from the outergap to the observer .    a generic model ( polar cap and/or outergap ) for the tails of pulsed differential spectra is then given by @xmath12 the second component would be absent in the case of pure polar cap @xmath0-ray emitters , with the additional signature of a super exponential cutoff ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "an outergap origin can be interpreted in terms of a non - zero @xmath15 , but with slower rollovers compared to polar cap models , since the outerap absorption process is controlled by photon - photon pair production , which has a weaker energy dependence compared to magnetic pair production .",
    "timing and spectroscopic observations in the 10 gev to 10 tev region can therefore discriminate between such models , and glast is expected to play a key role in this regard , but next generation telescopes such as h.e.s.s . , magic and celeste , stacee ( at their full capacity ) should be able to steal some of the limelight in the meantime , with h.e.s.s . and cangaroo iv , veritas in the best position to test outergap models above 50 - 100 gev , given their stereo capability for efficient background rejection .",
    "to obtain conservative estimates for the detection rate , we have to employ the most conservative model .",
    "we therefore assume that the polar cap mechanism is responsible for the pulsed @xmath0-ray emission , so that our generic model reduces to a single component : @xmath16 whereas pulsar photon spectral indices between @xmath17 and 2.1 are observed , harder spectra are theoretically possible for middle - aged pulsars ( a.k .",

    "the constant @xmath18 represents the monochromatic flux at the normalising energy @xmath19 .",
    "we will normalise spectra at @xmath20 near 1 gev .",
    "it was shown that the total @xmath0-ray pulsed luminosity @xmath21 ( pulsed ) scales roughly with the goldreigh julian pulsar current @xmath22 , which , in turn , is proportional to @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the spindown power . neglecting the differences in the spectral index and cutoff energies , we even find that the normalization constant @xmath18 ( in units of @xmath25s@xmath26gev@xmath26 ) at 1 gev scales with basic pulsar parameters : fitting @xmath18 as a power law function of the spindown power , we find ( normalised to the egret pulsars ) : @xmath27 the spindown power is in units of ergs / s .",
    "it is interesting to notice that vela and psr b1706 - 44 ( with similar values for @xmath24 ) give the largest scatter as a result of their significant differences in flux and distance .",
    "in fact , beaming and line - of - sight effects contribute to the large scatter .    whereas the total @xmath0-ray pulsed flux scales with pulsar current @xmath10 ( @xmath28 ) , we therefore find that the gev flux ( or luminosity ) , to a first order , scales as @xmath29 this finding is in principle consistent with the claim of nel & de jager ( 1995 ) that the mean photon energy increases with increasing pulsar age .",
    "thus , older ( lower @xmath24 ) pulsars become relatively brighter in the gev region , which explains the weaker dependence of the gev flux on current ( or spindown power ) .",
    "it is thus clear that ground - based @xmath0-ray observations may have the best chance of detecting middle aged pulsars , provided that the beaming is favorable , the distance is not too large , and the cutoff energy is well above 10 gev .",

    "it was shown by de jager , swanepoel & raubenheimer ( 1989 ) and de jager ( 1994 ) that the basic scaling parameter for any test for uniformity on the circle ( given a test period ) is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the pulsed fraction , with @xmath30 the pulsed rate and @xmath35 the background rate .",

    "by operating h.e.s.s . in a non - imaging topological trigger mode , we can accept low energy @xmath0-rays , while still rejecting @xmath55 of the background , which allows us to detect pulsations from pulsars if the spectral cutoff energy is above 30 gev .",

    "in fact , one may even be able to derive the period from a search in frequency if simultaneous radio observations are not available .",
    "it can be shown that a slight difference in cutoff energy can make an enormous difference in detection sensitivity : increasing the cutoff energy by a relatively small amount can change the situation from being a slave to radio information to that of determining radio parameters independent of radio information .",

    "one possibility is that the low magnetic fields associated with millisecond pulsars results in a relatively small cascading multiplicity , so that the mean photon energy which escapes from the polar cap is between 10 and 100 gev - much closer to the primary curvature @xmath0-ray energy compared to canonical high - b pulsars . h.e.s.s",
