    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario has been tremendously successful in reproducing observations of the distribution of matter on cosmic scales @xcite . in spite of this remarkable success",
    "the origin of this invisible component is still not known .",
    "this is because cosmological observations shed no light on the particle physics nature of dm and only suggest that dm consists of an approximately pressureless component that clusters gravitationally since a few e - foldings before matter - radiation equality .",
    "the leading high - energy physics candidates to dm are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . in principle",
    "these can be detected in underground laboratory experiments with a signal characterized by an annual modulation pattern .",
    "this has been thought to be a distinctive signature of dm direct detection against possible contamination from radioactive background noise .",
    "in fact the annual modulation is commonly considered a consequence of the orientation of the earth s orbit along or against the flow of dm particles in the galactic halo during the annual motion of the earth around the sun ( for a review see ref .",
    "a number of underground experiments such as dama / libra @xcite , cogent @xcite and cressst - ii @xcite have claimed the detection of dm particles with an annual modulation pattern .",
    "in contrast , the cdms - ii @xcite , xenon10 @xcite and more recently lux @xcite collaborations have reported none .",
    "searches for electroweak wimps at the large hadron collider have also given negative results so far .",
    "more puzzling is the fact that the detections from the underground experiments constrain different regions of the wimps parameter space @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that such contrasting outcomes may be hiding a much richer physics in the weak scale dark sector than previously thought or indicate the need of a completely new dark matter paradigm beyond weak scale wimps .",
    "the small - scale clustering of matter in the universe has emerged as the new arena to test the nature of dm .",
    "the discovery of a number of anomalies at small scales has cast doubts on the validity of the cdm hypothesis .",
    "the core - vs - cusp problem @xcite and the missing satellite problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) have motivated the study of alternative scenarios beyond the cdm paradigm .",
    "moreover , recent studies of the dynamical properties of the most luminous milky way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies have pointed to a new anomaly , the so - called too - big - to - fail problem @xcite .",
    "baryonic processes in galaxy formation have been invoked as the natural solution to these discrepancies ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as an example",
    ", baryon feedback and observational incompleteness can account for the missing satellite problem ( see e.g. refs .",
    "similarly , statistical variations in the predictions of subhalo abundances from n - body simulations combined with the uncertain value of the milky way virial mass may considerably alleviate the too - big - to - fail problem @xcite .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether baryonic feedback models can provide a unique self - consistent explanation to the entirety of dm anomalies ( see e.g. refs .",
    "furthermore , analyses of dwarf galaxies in the local field have shown that their abundance and properties differ significantly from the @xmath4cdm predictions @xcite .",
    "this is more difficult to reconcile with the cdm paradigm in terms of baryon feedback models given the fact that such isolated systems , contrary to satellites , undergo less complex processes .",
    "therefore , it can not be _ a priori _ excluded that such anomalies in the small - scale clustering of matter are ( also ) related to the unknown nature of dm ( for a review see ref .",

    "the effective thermal wdm mass range is severely constrained by the determination of the high - redshift matter power spectrum inferred from lyman-@xmath0 forest measurements @xcite .",

    "@xcite have shown that the dynamical properties of galactic wdm subhalos are indistinguishable from those of cdm , thus leaving the too - big - to - fail problem unsolved .",
    "indeed , if the small - scale anomalies are entirely due to the particle physics nature of dark matter , then requiring their simultaneous solution poses strong constraints on dm models ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another class of models alternative to the standard cdm hypothesis has developed around the possibility that dm particles have significant self - interactions @xcite .",
    "this scenario , also known as self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) , arises in the context of particle physics models of the dm sector ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a key prediction of these models is the fact that dm particles have velocity - dependent self - scattering cross sections .",
    "these self - interactions , which can be assimilated to gravitational scalar forces , alter the nonlinear gravitational collapse , leaving characteristic signatures in the small - scale clustering of matter",

    "the subhalo mass function remains identical to that of cdm , thus leaving the missing satellite problem unsolved .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that such a class of models can provide a successful solution if an additional interaction of the dm component with radiation is considered .",
    "a different family of models consists of scenarios in which dm is the result of a decay or a phase transition process .",
    "for instance , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have explored the possibility that neutral dark matter particles are the result of the decay of charged particles coupled to the photon - baryon plasma before recombination , while ref .",
    "@xcite has proposed a scenario in which early dark matter particles decay into a less massive species and a massless noninteracting one . in the latter case",
    "the resulting species eventually disrupt the formation of low - mass halos as investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , while still satisfying bounds from lyman-@xmath0 observations @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider a scenario in which the dm is consequence of a phase transition in the dynamics of a scalar field .",
    "in particular , we focus on _ late - forming dark matter _ ( lfdm ) @xcite , inspired by particle physics models of neutrino dark energy @xcite which aim to provide a unified description of dark matter and dark energy . in lfdm models ,",
    "dm particles are the result of a phase transition in the equation of state of a scalar field from radiation ( @xmath13 ) to matter ( @xmath14 ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a different realization of this scenario )",
    ". a distinctive characteristic of lfdm models is the presence of a damped oscillatory tail at the small scales of the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "however , contrary to other nonstandard dm models , the range of scales where such a distinctive feature occurs is set by the epoch of the phase transition ( rather than the value of the dm particle mass or the amplitude of the self - interaction cross section ) .",
    "the earlier the transition , the smaller the scale where the suppression of power occurs . in this regard , models of ultralight axion ( ula ) dark matter can also be seen as a form of late - forming dark matter where the axion field transitions from a vacuum state ( @xmath15 ) to matter ( @xmath14 ) when the field mass becomes comparable to the hubble scale ( see e.g. ref .",
    "ula dark matter alters the linear cosmic structure formation ; thus it is constrained by observations of the large - scale structures as recently shown in @xcite .",
    "this occurs in lfdm only if the transition to dm state occurs after recombination , otherwise lfdm exclusively affects the linear matter power spectrum at small scales , thus leaving potentially observable features in the nonlinear structure formation .",
    "given the similarities between the ula and lfdm models , it is reasonable to expect that in some viable region of the ula parameter space , the two scenarios may share the same phenomenology of the matter clustering at small scales , which is yet to be studied . in this paper",
    "we present a first study of the nonlinear structure formation of lfdm and assess the viability of this scenario using a series of high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ lfdm_cosmo ] we recall the main features of the lfdm model . in sec .",
    "[ simulation_code ] we describe the numerical methods , the generation of initial conditions and n - body simulation characteristics . in sec .",
    "[ pow ] we analyze the nonlinear matter power spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ hmf ] we describe the imprints on the halo mass function . in sec .",
    "[ profiles ] we present the results from the halo density profiles . in sec .",
    "[ mcvf ] we probe the circular velocity distribution , and we conclude in sec .  [ conclu ] .",
    "in the following , we will briefly review the main features of the lfdm scenario that are relevant to the study of cosmic structure formation .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper by das and weiner @xcite for a detailed description of the model .    in this scenario ,",
    "dm is the result of the dynamical evolution of a scalar field coupled to a thermal bath of relativistic particles ( e.g. ev sterile neutrinos ) . at high temperature ( early times )",
    "the field is trapped in a metastable state and behaves as a dark radiation fluid with an equation of state @xmath13 . as temperature drops due to the cosmic expansion , a new lower energy minimum appears and the field rolls into the lower energy state while oscillating around the true minimum of the scalar potential , thus behaving as a collisionless dm component ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "because of the coupling to the thermal bath of relativistic particles , deep in the radiation era ( before phase transition ) the scalar field density fluctuates through damped oscillations ( similarly to the baryon acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon plasma during the tight - coupling regime ) . after the transition , lfdm behaves as standard cdm , and the damped oscillations remain imprinted in the density fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "this damped oscillatory pattern is characteristic of other alternative dm scenarios in which dm is coupled to radiation ( see e.g. refs .",
    ". however , in the lfdm model the range of scales carrying the imprint of damped oscillation depends on the redshift of the phase transition , @xmath16 .",
    "the later the phase transition , the larger the scales where the power spectrum exhibits a damped oscillatory tail .",
    "the absence of these features in the large - scale power spectrum of galaxies imposes constraints on the redshift of the transition .",
    "in particular , a recent analysis indicates that @xmath17 @xcite . since after the phase transition lfdm behaves as a collisionless component , the linear cosmic structure formation is indistinguishable from that of the standard @xmath4cdm model .",
    "however , in order to produce sufficient dark matter abundance , an excess of scalar dark radiation ( in addition to that of neutrinos and photons ) is needed at early times . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a small excess contributing to @xmath18 , thus well within the cmb constraints @xcite , is sufficient to give the right amount of dark matter particles .    as an example , in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy power spectrum for a flat @xmath4-lfdm model with cosmological constant against a @xmath4cdm model best fit to planck data @xcite . in this specific lfdm model",
    "the phase transition occurs at @xmath19 , and the cosmological parameters are set to the values of the standard @xmath4cdm model .",
    "we have computed the cmb and matter power spectrum of the lfdm model using a modified version of the camb code @xcite to solve the dynamics of the coupled linear perturbation equations associated with the lfdm component .",
    "we may notice that even without a model parameter optimization requiring a monte carlo likelihood analysis of available data , the choice of the @xmath4-lfdm model parameters provides a good fit to the planck measurements ( the small differences arise essentially from the small excess of dark radiation density before matter - radiation equality ) . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot the corresponding linear matter power spectra at redshift @xmath20 against the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) power spectrum from the sloan digital sky survey seventh data release ( sdss dr7 ) @xcite .",
    "as we can see the spectra are identical on the large scales , while differences are only present at @xmath21 h mpc@xmath2 due to lfdm damped oscillations on nonlinear scales .",
    "the earlier the phase transition ( i.e. higher @xmath16 ) , the smaller the power spectrum cutoff scale , and the damped part of the spectrum shifts towards larger wave numbers .    it is worth mentioning that the linear lfdm power spectrum considered here resembles that of the models studied in refs .",
    "nonetheless , there are a few noticeable differences . in ref .  @xcite the authors have considered nonstandard models with dm - photon interactions characterized by a linear power spectrum that in the range @xmath22<100 $ ] has a damped oscillatory pattern with a slope different from that of the lfdm case ( see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while in ref .  @xcite the amplitude of the damped oscillations is significantly more suppressed than in our model realization ( see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "certain realizations of mixed cold and warm dark matter models such as those considered in refs .",
    "@xcite also have spectra that approximate the envelope of the lfdm spectrum ; however , they have different power distribution in the range @xmath22<100 $ ] .",
    "indeed , the slope of the suppressed part of the spectrum is a key aspect that differentiates the nonlinear structure formation of scenarios whose phenomenology depends solely on the presence of a cutoff in the linear matter power spectrum . for instance , in the right panel of fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot the linear spectra of a wdm thermal relic particle with mass @xmath23 kev characterized by a cutoff scale similar to that of lfdm , and of a broken - scale - invariance ( bsi ) inflationary model @xcite as the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite with highly tuned parameters . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was assumed @xmath24 , while to closely reproduce the lfdm spectrum we set @xmath25 .",
    "] such as to have the same cutoff scale and a slope of power suppression similar to that of the lfdm model .",
    "we can see that the spectra still carry differences that are likely to alter the nonlinear structure formation .",
    "in particular , in the case of the bsi spectrum , the model predicts an excess of power compared to the @xmath4cdm case before the cutoff ; thus it is likely to be highly constrained by high - redshift lyman-@xmath0 measurements .",
    "this is not the case for the wdm model , which differs from the lfdm beyond the cutoff scale , where the power exponentially drops several orders of magnitude below the envelope of lfdm damped oscillations . even considering a slightly larger thermal mass particle",
    ", this will only shift the exponential tail of the wdm spectrum to higher wave numbers , while still remaining more suppressed than the lfdm prediction due to the shallower slope of the lfdm envelope .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to expect that such differences may manifest with different predictions of the abundance and properties of low - mass halos .",
    "it is for these very reasons that , despite the numerous numerical studies of the nonlinear clustering of wdm models , it is opportune to investigate the phenomenology of the lfdm scenario and the like .",
    "we run a series of high - resolution n - body simulations using ramses @xcite , an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code with a tree - based data structure in which particles are evolved using a particle - mesh solver and the poisson equation is solved using a multigrid method @xcite .",
    "we generate the initial conditions with the code mpgrafic @xcite , which uses the zeldovich approximation .",
    "we set the initial redshift such that the standard deviation of the initial density field smoothed on the scale of the coarse grid @xmath26 is @xmath27 . with this choice ,",
    "the initial redshift of the simulations is sufficiently large to suppress spurious effects due to transients @xcite .",
    "we assume a flat @xmath4-lfdm model with phase transition redshift @xmath28 and characterized by the linear power spectrum shown in fig .",
    "the cosmological parameters are set to the following values : @xmath29 , h @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , we also consider a flat @xmath4cdm model with identical parameters .",
    "the simulations of the @xmath4-lfdm model consist of a box of @xmath34 volume with @xmath35 particles , a similar volume with @xmath36 particles , an intermediate box of @xmath37 with @xmath35 particles and a large box of @xmath38 volume with @xmath39 particles .",
    "this simulation suite enables us to control numerical systematic errors due to mass resolution and volume effects .",
    "the characteristics of the simulations are summarized in table  [ table_sim ] .",
    "we can see that for the highest mass resolution runs the spatial resolution of the simulations at the level of the coarse grid varies from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "however , the actual resolution of the simulations is much higher due to the amr scheme used in the ramses code .",
    "for instance , in the case of the @xmath34 volume simulation with @xmath36 particles we have up to six refinement levels of the coarse grid which are triggered during the run ; thus the densest objects are resolved with a spatial resolution of @xmath42 .",

    "the simulations were run on the ada supercomputer of the institute for development and resources in intensive scientific computing ( idris ) .",

    "first , we may notice that the spectra of the large ( solid line ) and intermediate ( dotted line ) volumes are fairly in agreement at @xmath53 h mpc@xmath2 , while in the same range the amplitude of the spectrum of the smaller simulation box ( dashed line ) is slightly lower .",
    "this is due to finite volume effects as well as the choice of the initial phase ( see e.g. refs .",

    "this suggests that the use of standard mass function formulas developed in the framework of the cdm paradigm to infer predictions for nonstandard cdm models characterized by a cutoff in the linear matter power spectrum at small scales may lead to significant misestimates of the halo abundances at low mass .",
    "let us now turn to the comparison of the halo abundance between @xmath4cdm and @xmath4-lfdm . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we plot the mass function of @xmath4cdm halos relative to that of the @xmath4-lfdm at @xmath85 and @xmath84 in mass bins of size @xmath95 containing at least @xmath71 halos . again",
    ", the ratio is of order unity at all simulated redshifts for @xmath93 which is consistent with the fact that in this range the multiplicity functions of the two models are identical .",
    "furthermore , in this range also the variance of the smoothed linear density field predicted by the two cosmologies is nearly identical , thus leading to a similar halo abundance well reproduced by the st mass function .",
    "in contrast , we can see that for @xmath94 , halos in @xmath4cdm are up to a factor of @xmath52 more abundant than in @xmath4-lfdm .",
    "this is due to the differences in the multiplicity function shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and amplified by the fact that on these scales the smoothed linear density field of the @xmath4-lfdm model is suppressed compared to the @xmath4cdm case . also notice that there is no redshift evolution of the relative abundance between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , while a modest evolution occurs at higher redshifts for halos with mass @xmath98 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in @xmath4-lfdm , small - mass halos form later than in @xmath4cdm , thus leading to differences that can be tested through high - redshift universe observations as already explored in the case of wdm models in ref .",
    "the lower abundance of low - mass halos in lfdm models compared to @xmath4cdm is a direct consequence of the suppression of power at small scale in the linear matter power spectrum beyond the cutoff scale . since in the lfdm scenario",
    "the location of the cutoff depends on the epoch of dark matter formation , we can expect that dm forming earlier than that in the model considered here will decrease the discrepancy with respect to the @xmath4cdm model , while a later formation will increase it .",
    "thus , measurements of the abundance of dwarf galaxies may provide direct constraints on the epoch of dark matter formation in lfdm models .",
    "we now focus on the density profile of dm halos . in fig .",

    "moreover , we limit the curves up to the physical scale associated with the size of the most refined cell of the simulations .",
    "we can see that the lower - resolution simulations systematically underestimate the profile differences with respect to the higher - resolution runs with deviations up to @xmath101 level .",
    "we find that density profiles for halos with mass @xmath102 are nearly identical in the two cosmologies for @xmath103 . at smaller radii",
    ", deviations do not exceed the @xmath87 , level with @xmath4cdm halos being on average denser than in @xmath4-lfdm . in the case of halos with mass in the range @xmath104",
    ", we find larger deviations .",
    "in particular , in the cdm case the averaged profile at radii @xmath105 is @xmath106 denser than the lfdm counterpart . as already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is consistent with the fact that the two models only differ for the amplitude of the initial power spectrum at small scales .",
    "in fact , as shown by the analysis of the mass function , the suppression of power at small scales in the @xmath4-lfdm model causes small - mass halos to form later than in @xmath4cdm , thus resulting in lower density profiles .",
    "halos of higher mass , on the other hand , assemble nearly at the same time in the two cosmologies , thus leading to nearly identical profiles . if the trend shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] at small radii is extrapolated to lower - mass halos , then these results do not exclude the possibility that halos with mass @xmath107 may have cored profiles ; however , we are not able to address this point at the moment , since our simulations do not possess the required resolution .     in @xmath4cdm with respect to the @xmath4-lfdm model , as a function of radius normalized by @xmath99 .",

    "in contrast , the velocity function , i.e. the number density of galaxies with a given circular velocity , can be predicted more reliably and tested against observations .",
    "it is indeed the comparison of the circular velocity of the satellites of the local group against n - body simulation results that originally pointed to the missing satellite problem @xcite .",
    "another advantage of the velocity function is that it probes the abundance of all virialized structures . in the past few years",

    "more specifically , we correct the estimated halo circular velocities to account for the effect of baryons using the prescription described in ref .",

    ", the fraction of subhalos may be even smaller due to the power suppression at small scales ; thus the choice adopted here is a rather conservative one .    in fig .",

    "furthermore , since the suppression is related to the transition redshift @xmath16 of dm formation ( the later the transition , the larger the suppression of low - mass halo abundances ) , it is possible that setting @xmath16 to a value slightly smaller than that assumed here may reproduce the observed velocity distribution up to statistical errors .",

    "the distribution of matter at small scales may provide insights on the nature of dark matter particles and potentially constrain scenarios alternative to the standard cold dark matter paradigm . in this work",
    "we have performed a first study of the nonlinear clustering of late - forming dark matter using a suite of high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "the main phenomenological feature of this scenario is the presence of damped acoustic oscillations at large wave numbers in the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "the scale where such a power suppression occurs depends on the epoch of the phase transition of a scalar field coupled to relativistic particles that generates the dm particles . without requiring an extreme fine - tuning of the microscopic model parameters ,",
    "this may occur before matter - radiation equality and imprint a pattern of damped oscillations at @xmath21 h mpc@xmath2 in the initial conditions .",
    "because of this , lfdm models are indistinguishable from standard cdm on large scales , while they are constrained by probes of the small - scale clustering of matter .    from the analysis of n - body simulations",
    ", we have shown that lfdm could be a viable alternative to cdm , as it provides predictions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum largely consistent with bounds from high - redshift lyman-@xmath0 power spectrum measurements .",
    "it should be noted that the lyman-@xmath0 constraints have so far been obtained for a restricted class of dm models ( such as wdm ) with a sharp cutoff in the linear power spectrum . as lfdm models have spectra with considerably shallower slopes than wdm",
    ", it is very likely that lfdm models that resolve @xmath4cdm inconsistencies on galactic and subgalactic scales would also be in better agreement with lyman-@xmath0 measurements .",
    "we have evaluated the halo abundance ; comparison with predictions from the standard @xmath4cdm model shows that small - mass lfdm halos ( @xmath116<10^{10}$ ] ) are less abundant than their cdm counterparts .",
    "we have also evaluated the corresponding differences in the circular velocity function at @xmath20 and shown that the lfdm scenario is in better agreement with observations of the number density of low - velocity galaxies than @xmath4cdm .",
    "the number density of low - mass halos varies with redshift , with low - mass halo abundance up to @xmath117 smaller than @xmath4cdm at @xmath118 .",
    "this indicates that halos in this mass range form later than in @xmath4cdm , thus leading to lower densities in the internal part of the halos as confirmed by the study of density profiles . on the other hand ,",
    "the assembly of more massive halos occurs as in @xmath4cdm , and we find no significant differences in their density profiles between the two cosmologies .",
    "these results confirm previous numerical studies of nonstandard dm models characterized by initial linear matter power spectra similar to that of lfdm .",
    "since lfdm behaves as a collisionless component , the lack of cored profiles in milky way  like halos seems inherently related to the fact that in order to satisfy the lyman-@xmath0 constraints , the suppression of power in the initial power spectrum must occur on wave number @xmath119 h mpc@xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that only by including dm self - interactions would it be possible to develop cored profiles . on the other hand",
    ", one should note that baryonic feedback does play a role at these scales .",
    "given the differences in the abundance and assembly of small - mass halos in @xmath4-lfdm and @xmath4cdm , it will be of interest to investigate the dynamics of baryons in the lfdm scenario .",

    "the excursion set theory @xcite , this can be computed from the distribution of random walks first crossing a collapse density threshold that encodes the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of matter collapse .",

    "hence , the large deviations from unity of the ratio of the multiplicity functions at low masses shown in the left panel of fig .  [ fig5 ] are clearly indicative of a departure of the nonlinear collapse dynamics of the @xmath4-lfdm model from that of the @xmath4cdm .",

    "<S> we perform a study of the nonlinear clustering of matter in the late - forming dark matter ( lfdm ) scenario in which dark matter results from the transition of a nonminimally coupled scalar field from radiation to collisionless matter . </S>",
    "<S> a distinct feature of this model is the presence of a damped oscillatory cutoff in the linear matter power spectrum at small scales . </S>",
    "<S> we use a suite of high - resolution n - body simulations to study the imprints of lfdm on the nonlinear matter power spectrum , the halo mass and velocity functions and the halo density profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the model largely satisfies high - redshift matter power spectrum constraints from lyman-@xmath0 forest measurements , while it predicts suppressed abundance of low - mass halos ( @xmath1 h@xmath2 m@xmath3 ) at all redshifts compared to a vanilla @xmath4cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the lfdm halo velocity function shows a better agreement than the @xmath4cdm prediction with the observed abundance of low - velocity galaxies in the local volume . </S>",
    "<S> halos with mass @xmath5 h@xmath2 m@xmath3 show minor departures of the density profiles from @xmath4cdm expectations , while smaller - mass halos are less dense , consistent with the fact that they form later than their @xmath4cdm counterparts . </S>"
