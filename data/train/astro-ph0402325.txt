    "t dwarfs are a spectral class of brown dwarfs distinguished by the presence of ch@xmath3 , h@xmath2o , and h@xmath2 collision - induced absorption ( cia ) in the near - infrared @xcite , and heavily pressure - broadened and absorption at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "these objects have effective temperatures ( t@xmath8s ) ranging from @xmath01300 k at the transition between l and t dwarfs @xcite to @xmath0750 k for the latest - type t dwarf 2mass 0415@xmath90935 @xcite .",
    "t dwarfs therefore comprise the coldest and intrinsically faintest brown dwarfs currently known , and as such are key objects for testing brown dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models @xcite , probing the extreme low - mass end of the initial mass function @xcite , and expanding the census of the sun s nearest neighbors .    for the past two years",

    "this three - band , near - infrared ( @xmath10 ) imaging survey samples the peak of the t dwarf spectral energy distribution , and is therefore the most sensitive wide - field sky survey currently available for identifying these cold brown dwarfs .",
    "our results to date include the discovery of the bright , and therefore potentially very close ( @xmath11 @xmath12 8 pc ) t dwarf 2mass 1503 + 2525 ( * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter paper ii ) . here",
    "we present the discovery of seven new t dwarfs in both northern and southern hemispheres , all of which were verified by low resolution ( r@xmath0150 ) spectroscopic observations obtained with the irtf 3.0 m spex instument @xcite .",
    "in @xmath13 2 we describe near - infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of t dwarf candidates and comparison stars made using spex and other imaging instruments . in @xmath13 3 we analyze these data , classifying both the new t dwarfs and background stars , including four potential ultracool ( spectral types later than sdm7 ) subdwarfs , using the low - resolution spectra and spectral comparison stars .",
    "we also report line strengths for the 1.243/1.252 @xmath1 doublet in six t dwarfs observed at moderate resolution ( r@xmath01200 ) with spex , and proper motions for all of the t dwarf discoveries . in @xmath13 4",

    "the new photometry pushes our candidates out of the initial selection criteria .",
    "however , these candidates were retained , and their adr photometry is reported throughout this article . to date , a total of 912 t dwarf candidates have been observed as part of this search program .",
    "follow - up near - infrared imaging observations of t dwarf candidates are required to eliminate the majority of contaminant sources .",
    "these include minor planets whose ephemerides were unknown or were not incorporated at the time of 2mass data processing , and image artifacts that remain in the 2mass wpsd .",
    "imaging observations also provide second epoch astrometry for confirmed t dwarfs that may be used to measure proper motion .",
    "we therefore conducted a series of imaging campaigns using various instrumentation on 1 - 4 m class telescopes .",
    "the spex instrument is comprised of a 1024@xmath201024 insb array as the primary detector for the spectrograph , and a second 512@xmath20512 insb array imaging / guiding camera with a @xmath21 field - of - view ( 0@xmath512 pixels ) .",

    "all data were reduced using the spextool package @xcite .",
    "for both the prism and sxd datasets , science data were corrected for linearity , pair - wise subtracted , and divided by the corresponding median - combined flat field image .",
    "spectral data were optimally extracted using the default settings for aperture and background source regions , and wavelength calibration was determined from arc lamp and sky emission lines .",
    "multiple spectral observations for each source were then median - combined after scaling the spectra to match the highest signal - to - noise observation .",
    "telluric and instrumental response corrections for the science data were determined using the method outlined in @xcite . for the prism observations ,",
    "line shape kernels were derived from the arc lines ; for the sxd observations , they were derived from the 1.005 @xmath1 paschen @xmath30 line in the a0 calibrator spectra .",
    "adjustments were made to the telluric spectra to compensate for differing line strengths and velocity shifts .",
    "final calibration was made by multiplying the observed target spectrum by its respective telluric correction spectrum .",
    "for the sxd data , multiple orders for each target exposure were scaled and combined using the corresponding low - resolution prism spectrum as a relative flux template .",
    "examination of the low - resolution spectra indicate that the majority of these candidate sources are late - type m dwarfs , based on the presence of weak h@xmath2o absorption at 1.4 and 1.9 @xmath1 ; co absorption at 2.3 @xmath1 ; tio and vo bands at 0.71.0 @xmath1 ; and feh , , and absorption at @xmath19-band .",
    "this result is not unexpected , as many of these sources have @xmath31 , implying @xmath32 35 at the detection limit of the dss plates @xcite , typical for late - type m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the faintness of these objects also imply significant errors in their 2mass photometry , which explains in part their unusually blue @xmath33 colors .    nevertheless , to better understand the nature of these contaminant sources , we classified their spectra by comparison to a suite of m- and l - type spectral standards and known objects , as listed in table 3 . a representative sample of these comparison spectra are shown in figure 1 . for the dwarfs , the strengthening of the 1.4 and 1.9 @xmath1 h@xmath2o bands , and 0.99 and 1.2 @xmath1 feh bands ; appearance of the 1.17 and 1.25 @xmath1 doublets ; weakening of the 0.76 , 0.82 , and 0.84 @xmath1 tio bands ;",
    "shift in peak flux toward 1.3 @xmath1 ; and reddening of the 1.32.4 @xmath1 spectral energy distribution are all correlated with spectral type .",
    "subdwarfs show distinctively stronger 0.99 @xmath1 feh absorption and weaker co and tio absorption than the dwarfs for equivalent h@xmath2o band strengths , as well as a shift in the peak of their spectral energy distributions to shorter wavelengths .",
    "giant and supergiant m stars exhibit much deeper h@xmath2o bands and stronger vo , tio , and co absorption , but fairly weak or absent metal hydride bands and atomic lines .",
    "using these diagnostics and the comparison spectra , we visually classified each of the observed sources that were not identified as t dwarfs . these classifications , which we estimate are accurate to within @xmath00.5 - 1.0 subtypes , are listed in table 2 ; uncertain numerical or luminosity classifications due to low s / n data are noted by a colon .",
    "a large percentage of the late - type m dwarfs exhibit paschen @xmath7 emission ( 1.09 @xmath1 ) : 33% ( 6 of 18 ) of the m7-m7.5 dwarfs and 66% ( 12 of 18 ) of the m8-m8.5 dwarfs appear to be in emission , but none of the m5-m6.5 dwarfs . the observed emission is consistent with the high frequency ( @xmath0100% ) of h@xmath34 emission seen in the optical spectra of m7m8 dwarfs @xcite .",
    "while most of the background sources exhibit spectral energy distributions and absorption features similar to the dwarf comparison stars , a handful of sources appear to be peculiar .",
    "these include four objects that exhibit subdwarf characteristics .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , 2mass 0142 + 0523 , 2mass 1640 + 1231 , and 2mass 1640 + 2922 all appear to be similar to or somewhat later than the sdm7.5 lsr 2036 + 5059 @xcite , with strong 0.86 , 0.99 , and 1.2 @xmath1 feh absorption ; weak 2.3 @xmath1 co absorption ; moderately strong 1.4 and 1.9 @xmath1 h@xmath2o absorption ; and a relatively blue 12.5 @xmath1 spectral slope .",
    "another source , 2mass 0041 + 3547 , exhibits spectral features similar to the l1 standard 2mass 1439 + 1929 @xcite , but has stronger 0.86 and 0.99 @xmath1 feh absorption , weaker co , and a somewhat bluer 1.32.4 @xmath1 spectral slope .",
    "this object may be a new early - type l subdwarf , similar to lsr 1610 - 0040 @xcite .",
    "however , as there currently exists no classification scheme for ultracool subdwarfs at near - infrared wavelengths , we characterize these sources as candidate subdwarfs for the time being ; further spectral analysis will be presented in a future publication . it should be noted that only four subdwarfs later than type m7 are currently known @xcite .",
    "finally , we address one additional background source , 2mass 1733 + 1529 , classified here as a dc 10 white dwarf based on its blackbody slope and absence of absorption lines ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this object was selected because of its absence in the first generation palomar sky survey ( poss - i ) @xmath35-band plate ( figure 4 , left ) , although it is present on the @xmath36-band plate as well as the @xmath36- , @xmath35- ( figure 4 , right ) , and @xmath37-band plates of poss - ii .",
    "the absence of this source in the poss - i @xmath35-band image was independently verified by m.  gray and r.  humphreys to a faint limit of @xmath38 19.520.0 using the minnesota automated plate scanner catalog , and by visual examination of poss - i prints available at the caltech astrophysics library .",
    "2mass 1733 + 1529 is not listed in the @xcite white dwarf catalog ; and its small proper motion , 0@xmath505@xmath390@xmath504 yr@xmath6 , measured from lick 3 m gemini @xmath19-band imaging ( see @xmath13 3.3 ) , excludes it from the nltt @xcite and revised nltt @xcite proper motion catalogs . as this source is relatively bright in the optical ( @xmath35 = 16.9 in the usno - b1.0 catalog ; monet et al .",
    "2003 ) , and given the absence of any obvious photographic anomaly , it is unclear as to why it was undetected on the poss - i @xmath35-band plate .",
    "it is possible that 2mass 1733 + 1529 was obscured in this image by an eclipsing or transiting faint source , such as a low - mass stellar or substellar companion .",
    "monitoring observations are planned to verify or place stringent constraints on this intriguing hypothesis .",
    "seven of the candidates listed in table 2 exhibit clear absorption features of h@xmath2o ( 1.1 , 1.4 , and 1.9 @xmath1 ) and ch@xmath3 ( 1.3 , 1.6 , and 2.2 @xmath1 ) in their low - resolution spectra , characteristic of t dwarfs .",
    "finder charts for these objects are given in figure 5 , low - resolution spectra are diagrammed in figure 6 , and spectrophotometric properties are listed in table 5 .",
    "these objects exhibit a broad range of ch@xmath3 band strengths and near - infrared colors ( @xmath40 ) , encompassing early- , mid- , and late - type t dwarf spectral morphologies @xcite .",
    "the new t dwarfs were classified by their low - resolution spectra following the technique of @xcite , which is based on the established mk process of spectral classification ( e.g. , morgan 1984 ) .",
    "in addition to our candidates , we observed a set of five t dwarf spectral standards : sdss 0423@xmath90414 ( t0 ) , sdss 1254@xmath90122 ( t2 ) , 2mass 2254 + 3123 ( t4 ) , 2mass 0243@xmath92453 ( t6 ) , and 2mass 0415@xmath90935 ( t8 ) .",
    "the t2 , t6 , and t8 standards are those established in @xcite , while the t0 and t4 standards were selected as part of an expanded list of spectral standards given in @xcite . to quantify our classifications , we used revised spectral indices from the latter reference which sample the major h@xmath2o and ch@xmath3 bands in the 12.5 @xmath1 region while avoiding strong telluric absorption regions .",
    "these indices are defined as : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 designates the integrated flux between wavelengths @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and indices are defined as the ratio of flux at the base of the absorption band to the nearby pseudo - continuum region implies that no true continuum is present ; we therefore normalize to the local spectral maximum , or pseudo - continuum . ] .",
    "these spectral indices were measured for all t dwarfs in our low - resolution spectral sample .",
    "classifications for each index ( excluding the spectral standards ) were determined as the closest match to the standard values , allowing for subtypes halfway between the standard classes ( i.e. , integer subclasses ) .",
    "final classifications for each object were determined as the mean of the individual index classifications , rounded off to the nearest 0.5 subclass .",
    "table 6 lists the spectral indices and derived classifications for the new and previously known t dwarfs .",
    "the scatter amongst individual index subtypes is typically 0.40.7 subclasses , with some objects exhibiting no scatter , justifying our 0.5 subclass precision . as a check , we compared derived subtypes to those from the literature for seven previously identified and classified t dwarfs ; all were consistent within 0.5 subclasses .",
    "we also examined the behavior of the indices with spectral type , as shown in figure 7 ; all five indices show minimal scatter about a line connecting the standard values , again consistent with the adopted classification precision .",
    "the scatter in these indices is in fact better than that seen in the classifications of @xcite and @xcite , reflecting overall higher signal - to - noise data and the improved spectral index definitions .",
    "the spectral types for the t dwarf discoveries range from t3 ( 2mass 1209@xmath91004 ) to t7 ( 2mass 0034 + 0523 ) , the former object being the earliest - type t dwarf so far identified in our 2mass search .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , the derived classifications are consistent with a monotonic increase in h@xmath2o and ch@xmath3 bandstrengths with spectral type .",
    "moderate resolution spex spectra of six t dwarfs are shown in figure 8 .",
    "these data reveal the complex h@xmath2o and ch@xmath3 molecular features in far greater detail than the prism spectra . while the s /",
    "n of the higher resolution spectra are on average lower ( 1050% ) , most of the structure seen is real and repeats between the objects .",
    "these data also resolve the 1.243/1.252 @xmath1 doublet , shown in detail in figure 8 , a key diagnostic of temperature at the brightest peak in the spectral energy distribution .",
    "pseudo - equivalent widths ( pews ; equivalent width relative to the pseudo - continuum ) for these lines were measured following the method outlined in paper ii , directly integrating over the line profiles .",
    "results are given in table 7 .",
    "the strongest lines are found in the t5 2mass 2331@xmath94718 , which have pews of 8.5@xmath390.7 and 12.8@xmath390.6  for the 1.243 and 1.252 @xmath1 lines , respectively .",
    "indeed , with the exception of the t5.5 2mass 0516@xmath90445 ( for which only low s / n data have been obtained ) , these are the strongest lines measured in any t dwarf to date @xcite . both 2mass 1503 + 2525 and 2mass 1231 + 0847 exhibit broadened lines , possibly due to rapid rotation or high photospheric pressure , the latter case indicative of high surface gravity .",
    "also note the nearly absent lines in the t7 2mass 0034 + 0523 , due either to its low t@xmath8 or possibly metal deficiency ( see @xmath13 4.2 ) .",
    "overall , the observed line strengths are in general agreement with previous work , with the strongest lines found amongst the t5 dwarfs and becoming progressively weaker toward the later spectral types .",
    "proper motions for the t dwarf discoveries were measured using 2mass adr data and the follow - up imaging observations described in @xmath13 2.2 .",
    "data analysis was similar to that described in paper ii .",
    "we used 2mass catalog data as first epoch astrometry , while the follow - up images , taken roughly 35 years after the 2mass observations , comprised our second epoch dataset .",
    "2mass sources within the re - imaged areas ( excluding the t dwarf ) were matched to detected sources on the follow - up images .",
    "first - order coordinate solutions for the images were then determined by linear regression using this grid of background stars , allowing for the rejection of 3@xmath49 outliers ( i.e. , moving sources ) . for the iris2 ( ch@xmath3-s images only ) and ccd observations , @xmath01560 background sources were used , yielding positional uncertainties of 0@xmath510@xmath54 , equivalent to 2mass astrometric accuracy @xcite , and proper motion uncertainties of @xmath29 0@xmath51 yr@xmath6 . for the gemini observation of 2mass 1209@xmath91004 ,",
    "only four background objects were available and astrometric uncertainties were assumed to be somewhat higher . using these coordinate solutions , the second epoch position of the t dwarf was computed and its motion derived .",
    "we note that the agreement between proper motion determinations for 2mass 0034 + 0523 obtained with the palomar 60  ccd camera and aat iris2 lend confidence to the reliability of our measurements .",
    "table 8 lists the resulting proper motions .",
    "as expected for a nearby population of faint brown dwarfs , these objects have large motions in general , with 2mass 1231 + 0847 exhibiting the largest at 1@xmath555@xmath390@xmath507 yr@xmath6 .",
    "this object would be easily identified in a near - infrared proper motion survey . on the other hand ,",
    "two t dwarfs , 2mass 0407 + 1514 and 2mass 2331@xmath94718 , have motions below our sensitivity limits .",
    "we discuss the associated tangential velocities for these t dwarfs below .",
    "using the derived classifications and 2mass photometry , it is possible to estimate the spectrophotometric distances of our t dwarf discoveries .",
    "we employed the polynomial @xmath19- and @xmath50-band absolute magnitude / spectral type relations from @xcite , based on parallax measurements from their own program and from @xcite .",
    "distance estimates for each of the newly discovered t dwarfs were calculated in both bands ( with the exception of 2mass 0034 + 0523 which was not detected at @xmath50 by 2mass ) and for @xmath390.5 subclasses about the nominal classification .",
    "final distances and uncertainties were determined by the mean and standard deviation of these estimates , respectively , and are listed in table 5 . assuming that they are single sources , all of the objects listed are within 25 pc of the sun , with the most distant object being the earliest - type t dwarf 2mass 1209@xmath91004 .",
    "three objects , 2mass 0034 + 0523 , 2mass 1231 + 0847 , and 2mass 1828@xmath94849 , are at or within 10 pc from the sun within the reported uncertainties , with the first ( and latest - type ) object having an estimated distance of only 8.2@xmath391.5 pc .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainties in these distance estimates do not take into account systematic deviations in the absolute magnitude / spectral type relation @xcite nor possible duplicity , and should be confirmed by parallax measurement .    combining the distance estimates with the proper motion determinations from @xmath13 3.3",
    ", we calculated tangential velocities for these t dwarfs , listed in table 8 .",
    "the mean @xmath51 of those t dwarfs with detected motion is 43 km s@xmath6 with a standard deviation of 28 km s@xmath6 ; including the upper limits yields a somewhat lower mean of 33 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this value is consistent with the mean @xmath51 for disk dwarfs ( 39 km s@xmath6 ; reid & hawley 2000 ) but is somewhat higher than that for field late - type m and l dwarfs ( 22 km s@xmath6 ; gizis et al .",
    "2000 ) , suggesting that the t dwarfs in this sample may be drawn from a somewhat older population .",
    "a similar difference in the @xmath51 distribution between field l and t dwarfs has also been noted by @xcite , and a mean age difference between these classes is predicted in field substellar mass function simulations @xcite .",
    "this possible age segregation is consistent with the evolution of brown dwarfs , as an object of a given mass will evolve from warm ( l dwarf ) to cold ( t dwarf ) as it ages ; however , a larger sample must be considered before drawing any firm conclusions about the relative ages of the l and t dwarf field populations .",
    "we note that the spectrophotometric distance of 2mass 1231 + 0847 is consistent within its uncertainties to the nearby ( 13.4@xmath390.3 pc ; hipparchos ; perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) k7v star gliese 471 , located roughly 8@xmath241 ( 6500 au ) to the northwest . indeed ,",
    "2mass 1231 + 0847 was also identified in a parallel search for wide brown dwarf companions to nearby stars currently being conducted by j.  d.  kirkpatrick . however , while their direction of motion is nearly identical ( @xmath0230@xmath52 ) , 2mass 1231 + 0847 has a proper motion nearly twice as large as gliese 471 , and is therefore not a bound companion .",
    "the t7 2mass 0034 + 0523 has the bluest @xmath33 color amongst the t dwarf discoveries , and it may be even bluer as 2mass photometry provides only an upper limit .",
    "examination of near - infrared spectral data confirms this color , as 2mass 0034 + 0523 exhibits a fairly suppressed @xmath53-band peak in comparison to the rest of the t6t8 dwarfs observed .",
    "this is quantified in figure 9 , which plots the logarithm of the spectral ratio @xmath54 as a function of spectral type for all of the t dwarfs observed .",
    "spex prism data are ideally suited for this measurement , as the full near - infrared spectral range is sampled in a single order and no correction is required to match the relative scalings between the @xmath19- and @xmath53-bands .",
    "the ratio exhibits a tight linear trend across the full spectral type range of t dwarfs , although there is a somewhat greater spread in values amongst the t5t6 dwarfs .",
    "2mass 0034 + 0523 stands well above this trend , however , having the smallest value of @xmath55 , and hence the most suppressed @xmath53-band peak , in the entire sample .",
    "the spectral properties of this source are reminiscent of the peculiar t6 2mass 0937 + 2931 @xcite , which not only has a very blue near - infrared color ( @xmath56 ; paper i ) , likely due to enhanced cia h@xmath2 absorption , but also strong absorption from the pressure - broadened 0.77 @xmath1 resonance doublet and the 0.99 @xmath1 feh band @xcite .",
    "the enhanced pressure - sensitive features are symptomatic of a high pressure photosphere , which can exist on a brown dwarf with a high surface gravity ( i.e. , old and massive ) and/or a metal deficient atmosphere @xcite .",
    "indeed , strong feh and cia h@xmath2 absorption are hallmarks of cool halo subdwarf spectra ( figure 1 ) , which are themselves typically older and metal - poor , and 2mass 0937 + 2931 has been interpreted as a possible thick disk or halo brown dwarf @xcite .",
    "2mass 0034 + 0523 , like 2mass 0937 + 2931 , also has exceedingly weak 1.243/1.252 @xmath1 lines that may be due to reduced metallicity or higher surface gravity @xcite , although its late spectral type ( and hence cool temperature ) may be the dominant factor .",
    "2mass 0034 + 0523 does not have a large @xmath51 as might be expected for a halo star , although on an individual basis this does not rule out its membership in an older kinematic population .",
    "clearly , a more detailed study of both of these peculiar t dwarfs is needed to assess metallicity and/or gravity effects in cool brown dwarf spectra .",
    "to date , we have observed roughly 70% of our 2mass search sample , identifying 31 t dwarfs , 8 of which have estimated or measured @xcite distances within 10 pc of the sun .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the predicted numbers from paper i ( @xmath03545 t dwarfs ) , although we have uncovered less than half of the @xmath020 t dwarfs predicted to have distances less than 10 pc .",
    "many of the latter are probably late - type t dwarfs , t@xmath8 @xmath29 1000 k , too faint to be detected by 2mass beyond a few parsecs .",
    "in addition to these very low - luminosity sources , our search has identified one _ bona - fide _ ultracool halo subdwarf , the late - type sdl 2mass 0532 + 8246 @xcite , and now four candidate late - type subdwarfs requiring further verification .",
    "in retrospect , the search criteria employed are well - suited for identifying these metal - deficient objects , which have red optical / near - infrared colors , peak in flux at @xmath19-band , and exhibit relatively blue @xmath33 colors due to enhanced cia h@xmath2 absorption @xcite .",
    "such serendipitous discoveries provide a new opportunity for exploring the physical properties , particularly metallicity and age diagnostics , of very cool stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "we have discovered seven new t dwarfs in the 2mass survey with spectral types ranging from t3 to t7 , spectrophotometric distances of 8.2 to 23 pc , and proper motions from our detection limit ( 0@xmath51 yr@xmath6 ) to 1@xmath555 yr@xmath6 .",
    "this sample adds substantially to the current census of t dwarfs , now around 50 objects .",
    "we have also identified four candidate ultracool subdwarfs , including one possible early - type l subdwarf , which share the blue near - infrared colors and red optical / near - infrared colors of our t dwarf discoveries .",
    "we estimate that several t dwarfs remain to be identified in our sample , and possibly many more cool subdwarfs , yielding new targets in our quest to understand the observational properties of the lowest - mass stars and brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we thank our telescope operators bill golisch , dave griep , and paul sears , and instrument specialist john rayner , for their support during the irtf observations , and the irtf tac for its generous allocation of time for this project .",
