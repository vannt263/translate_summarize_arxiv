    "let @xmath0 be an oriented knot in a @xmath1-manifold @xmath2 . if @xmath0 is null - homologous , it bounds an embedded oriented surface @xmath4 , called a seifert surface .",
    "the least genus of such a surface is called the _ genus _ of @xmath0 , and is denoted @xmath7 .",
    "more generally , define the _ rational genus _ of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath8 , to be the infimum of @xmath3 over all embedded orientable surfaces @xmath4 in the complement of @xmath0 without disk or sphere components , whose boundary wraps @xmath5 times around @xmath0 for some @xmath5 ( a precise definition is given in   [ p_seifert_section ] ) .",
    "largely because of an approach to the berge conjecture via knot floer homology , there has been recent interest in the question of finding knots in @xmath1-manifolds with the property that they are the _ unique _ knot in their homology class with least rational genus .",
    "since knot floer homology detects the thurston norm , and therefore the rational genus of a knot ( see ozsvth ",
    "szab @xcite ) such knots have the property that they are characterized by their knot floer homology , and one can study such knots and surgeries on them using the surgery exact sequence .",
    "for example , the unknot in @xmath9 is the unique knot of genus @xmath10 , and various families of so - called `` simple knots '' in lens spaces are the unique knots of minimal rational genus in their respective homology classes ( see baker @xcite , hedden @xcite or rasmussen @xcite ) .",
    "other authors , e.g.  @xcite , have studied _ rational linking number _ , and its relation to contact geometry .",

    "see   [ example_subsection ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is firstly to initiate a systematic study of rational genus and some of its properties , and secondly to demonstrate that there is a universal positive constant such that knots in @xmath1-manifolds with rational genus bounded above by this constant can be completely classified .",
    "the precise statement of this classification , and the best estimate for the relevant constant , falls into several cases depending on the geometric decomposition of @xmath2 .    in the generic ( i.e.  hyperbolic ) case , the strategy is to deduce information about @xmath0 in two steps : @xmath17 an estimate for the rational genus of @xmath0 is really an estimate of the @xmath18-norm of a certain relative homology class ; such an estimate can be reinterpreted dually in terms of bounded cohomology",

    "homotopy information is promoted to isotopy information by drilling and filling , using uniform geometric estimates due to hodgson - kerckhoff @xcite , and gauss - bonnet .",
    "one interesting technical aspect of the argument is that it involves finding a @xmath20 representative of a surface in the complement of the cone locus of a hyperbolic cone manifold .",
