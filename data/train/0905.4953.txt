    "one of the basic implications of quantum mechanics is that there exist incompatible experimental setups .",

    "the fact that position and momentum are not experimentally compatible physical quantities reflects the very properties of the quantum theory leading to the concept of coexistence .",
    "in general , the coexistence of quantum devices means that they can be implemented as parts of a single device . until now , the coexistence relation has been studied among quantum effects and observables ; see e.g. @xcite and references therein . however , in addition to observed measurement outcome statistics we can also end up with a quantum system .",
    "quantum operations and instruments are used to mathematically describe both : probabilities of the observed measurement outcomes and conditional states of the measured quantum system post - selected according to observed outcomes . compared to an effect , an operation describes a particular result of a quantum measurement on a different level , providing more details about what happened during the measurement .",
