    "we have further investigated the time evolution of the galaxy - mass density relation . to develop the analysis , we have made the assumptions : ( i ) the galaxy formation and the merging process can be ignored ; ( ii ) the initial distribution of galaxies is given by the local function ( eq.[[init - g ] ] ) , while the total mass has the non - local initial condition .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * the conditional mean could be different from the deterministic biasing relation ( compare the relation [ [ tree - bias - para ] ] and [ [ coeff - gal ] ] ) . in the presence of the scatter",
    ", the perturbative inversion of @xmath42 does not recover the conditional mean @xmath112 . * the time evolution of the conditional mean @xmath42 shows that the non - linear term of the conditional means usually becomes negligible .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy - mass density relation could be approximated by the linear relation .",
    "* we have found that the time evolution of the skewness deduced from the conditional mean @xmath42 differs from that of the correct skewness @xmath52 in the case of the small cross correlation .",
    "this indicates that the stochasticity could have an important role in the estimation of the higher order moment of galaxies using the conditional mean",
    ".    the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) might not be valid in more realistic situation .",
    "the merging process might become important in a real universe and the galaxy formation would introduce the non - local initial condition .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our qualitative conclusions will not be altered even if these processes are taken into account . it would be interesting to incorporate these effects into the time evolution of the stochastic biasing .",
    "we will attack this issue in the future .",
    "the conditional mean @xmath42 is an important quantity to construct the analytic biasing model which is determined by the clustering properties of the halos ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the presence of the stochasticity",
    ", we must treat the conditional mean carefully when comparing it with the observation of the galaxy statistics , and vice versa .",
    "that is , the linear and non - linear biasing parameter ( @xmath191 ) estimated from the observation of the skewness or kurtosis does not necessarily give the mean biasing relation",
    ". they might provide a signal for the stochastic biasing . in the previous paper ( @xcite )",
    ", we found that the parameter @xmath155 deduced from the skewness can become negative in the presence of the scatter .",
    "the recent observation from the southern sky redshift survey shows that the non - linear biasing parameter @xmath155 estimated by the skewness may become negative for the biasing parameter @xmath192 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this might give an observational evidence for the stochastic biasing as long as our prescription is correct .",
    "the stochasticity is problematic when we get the relation between the galaxies and the total mass from the observation .",
    "as discussed by dekel & lahav ( 1998 ) , the situation may become more complicated in the redshift space .",
    "this makes it difficult to determine the cosmological parameter from the observation of the velocity field such as potent ( @xcite ) . for the analysis in the redshift space , scoccimarro , couchman & frieman ( 1998 ) studied the influence of the non - linear biasing on the bi - spectrum of the galaxies in the deterministic case .",
    "we must investigate how the stochasticity and the non - linearity affect the galaxy biasing in the redshift space .",
    "in particular , the higher order statistics such as the skewness and the bi - spectrum should be explored .",
    "extension of our formalism to the redshift space is straightforward and the analysis is now going on ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternative approach to understand the stochastic property of the galaxy biasing is to seek the physical origin of the stochastic biasing itself .",
    "et al_. ( 1998 ) explored the hidden variable to reduce the stochasticity in the relation between galaxies and total mass using the hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "they found that the scatter around the conditional mean of the galaxies becomes small if the temperature dependence is taken into account .",
    "to combine this approach with ours is also interesting .",
    "this work is partially supported by monbusho grant - in - aid for scientific research 10740118 .",
    "in this appendix , we explain the calculation for the derivation of the galaxy - mass density relation as a conditional mean in section [ subsec : derivation ] .",
    "we start to write down the generating function @xmath65 expanded in powers of @xmath36 . from the scaling relation ( [ scaling - relation ] ) , the generating function up to the order @xmath73 is obtained in terms of the normalized variables ( [ new - var ] ) : @xmath193 note that the first line in the right hand side of ( [ expand - w ] ) is of the order of unity .",
    "the second and the third lines are the terms of @xmath85 and @xmath73 , respectively . using the expression ( [ expand - w ] ) , the conditional mean @xmath42 given by equation ( [ dg - dm ] ) is calculated in the following way . for the numerator @xmath194 , we rewrites the expression ( [ a ] ) to @xmath195 integrating by part and substituting the expansion ( [ expand - w ] ) into equation ( [ cal a ] ) , we get @xmath196 keeping the terms up to @xmath73 , this becomes @xmath197 \\int d\\mu e^{-i\\mu x-\\mu^2/2 } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we replaced @xmath198 with @xmath199 . performing the integration of @xmath200 and the differentiation with respect to @xmath71",

    "the calculation of the denominator in equation ( [ dg - dm ] ) is similar to that of the numerator .",
