    "in the standard model @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not mass eigenstates .",
    "instead we have ( the small cp - violating effects are neglected ) @xmath5 so the time evolution of the @xmath6 states looks like @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass eigenvalue and @xmath9 - the corresponding width .",
    "it follows from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) that the probability for @xmath3 meson not to change its flavour after a time @xmath10 from the creation is @xmath11 and the probability to convert into the @xmath4 meson ",
    "@xmath12where @xmath13 is the average width and @xmath14 .",
    "so @xmath15 mass difference between the @xmath16 mass eigenstates defines the oscillation frequency .",
    "standard model predicts @xcite that @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element .",
    "therefore the mixing in the @xmath19 meson system proceeds much more faster than in the @xmath20 system .",
    "the total probability @xmath21 that a @xmath3 will oscillate into @xmath4 is @xmath22 in the first @xmath23-mixing experiments @xcite just this time integrated mixing probability was measured .",
    "the result @xcite @xmath24 shows that in the @xmath1 system @xmath25 is expected .",
    "in fact the allowed range of @xmath26 is estimated to be between @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the standard model @xcite .",
    "such a big value of @xmath26 makes impossible time integrated measurements in the @xmath1 system , because @xmath21 in ( 5 ) saturates at @xmath29 for large values of x.    although it was thought that unlike the kaon system for the @xmath16 mesons the decay width difference can be neglected @xcite , nowadays people is more inclined to believe the theoretical prediction @xcite that the @xmath30 transition , with final states common to both @xmath1 and @xmath31 , can generate about 20% difference in lifetimes of the short lived and long lived @xmath1-mesons @xcite .",
    "but we can see from the ( 3 @xmath32 5 ) formulas that the effect of nonzero @xmath33 is always @xmath34 and so of the order of several percents , because @xmath35 is expected . in the following",
    "we will neglect this effect and will take @xmath36 , though in some formulas @xmath33 is kept for reference reason .",
    "the development of high precision vertex detectors made it possible to measure @xcite in the @xmath23 system the time dependent asymmetry @xmath37 the same techniques can also be applied to the @xmath38 system .",
    "recently the atlas detector sensitivity to the @xmath26 parameter was studied @xcite using @xmath39 decay chain for @xmath1 meson reconstruction .",
    "it was shown that @xmath26 up to 40 should be within a reach @xcite .",
    "the signal statistics could be increased by using other decay channels , like @xmath40 .",
    "the purpose of this note is to study the usefulness of the decay chain @xmath41 for @xmath1 meson reconstruction in the atlas @xmath1-mixing experiments .",
    "about 20 000 following b - decays were generated using the pythia monte carlo program @xcite",
    "@xmath42 = @xmath43 = @xmath44 + @xmath45 = @xmath46 + @xmath47 + @xmath45 = @xmath48 + @xmath49    the impact parameter was smeared using the following parameterized description of the impact parameter resolution @xmath50 where resolutions are in @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the angle with respect to the beam line .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this parameterized resolution reasonably reproduces the results obtained by using the full simulation and reconstruction programs .",
    "for the transverse momentum resolution an usual expression @xcite @xmath53 was assumed .",
    "track reconstruction efficiencies for various particles were taken from @xcite . because now we have 6 particles in the final state instead of 4 for the @xmath2 decay channel , we expect some loss in statistics due to track reconstruction inefficiencies , but the effect is not significant because the investigation in @xcite indicates a high reconstruction efficiency of 0.95 .",
    "the topology of a considered @xmath19 decay chain is shown schematically in a figure :    ( 150,110 ) ( 40,40 ) ( 40,40)(-3,-2)30 ( 12,17)*@xmath54 * ( 40,40)(2,1)40 ( 62,45)*@xmath55 * ( 80,60)(3,-1)15 ( 83,52)*@xmath43 * ( 95,55)(3,1)33 ( 130,65)*@xmath56 * ( 95,55)(3,0)35 ( 133,55)*@xmath57 * ( 95,55)(3,-2)35 ( 130,35)*@xmath58 * ( 80,60)(1,3)10 ( 85,90)*@xmath59 * ( 80,60)(2,3)20 ( 102,90)*@xmath58 * ( 80,60)(3,2)30 ( 112,80)*@xmath59 *    the @xmath1 decay vertex reconstruction was done in the following three steps .    first of all the @xmath60 was reconstructed by finding three charged particles presumably originated from the @xmath60 decay and fitting their tracks .",
    "for this goal all combinations of the properly charged particles were examined in the generated events , assuming that two of them are kaons and one is pion .",
    "the resulting invariant mass distribution is shown in fig.1a for signal events .",
    "the expected @xmath60 peak is clearly seen along with moderate enough combinatorial background .",
    "cuts on @xmath61  ,   @xmath62 and @xmath63 were selected in order to optimize signal to background ratio .",
    "to select one more cut on @xmath64 , the information about the invariant mass resolution is desirable .",
    "2a shows the reconstructed @xmath60 meson from its true decay products .",
    "the finite invariant mass resolution is due to applied track smearing and equals approximately to @xmath65 .",
    "after @xmath60 meson reconstruction , @xmath66 meson was searched in three particle combinations from the remaining charged particles , each particle in the combination being assumed to be a pion .",
    "1b shows a resulting invariant mass distribution for signal events . because of huge width of @xmath66 , signal to background separation is not so obvious in this case . if @xmath66 is reconstructed from its true decay products as in fig .",
    "2b , its width is correctly reproduced . to draw out @xmath66 from the background ,",
    "further cuts were applied on @xmath67  ,   @xmath68  ,   @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    at last @xmath19 decay",
    "vertex was fitted , using reconstructed @xmath60 and @xmath66 .",
    "almost the same resolution in the @xmath1-decay proper time was reached @xmath71 , as in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding resolution in the b - meson decay length in the transverse plane is @xmath72 .",

    "that we use an updated value for br(@xmath74 ) from @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 branching ratios are still unknown experimentally . neglecting su(3 ) unitary symmetry breaking effects , we have taken br(@xmath73)@xmath75 br(@xmath76 ) .",
    "+ branching ratios and signal statistics for @xmath77 . +    [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we see , about 2065 reconstructed @xmath19 are expected after one year run at @xmath78 luminosity .",
    "the corresponding number of events within one standard deviation ( @xmath79 ) from the @xmath19 mass equals 1407 .",
    "this last number should be compared to 2650 signal events , as reported in @xcite , when @xmath80 decay channel is used .",
    "events which pass the first level muon trigger ( latexmath:[$p_t > 6~ gev / c,~    background can come from other @xmath16 decays of the same or higher charged multiplicity , and from random combinations with some ( or all ) particles originating not from a @xmath16 decay ( combinatorial background ) .    the following channels were considered and no significant contributions were found to the background :    * @xmath82 . these events",
    "do nt pass the analysis cuts , because the @xmath83 mass is shifted from the @xmath60 mass by about 100 mev , and so does the @xmath20 mass compared to the @xmath19 mass .",
    "* @xmath84 followed by @xmath85 .",
    "taking @xmath86 from @xcite , we see that the expected number of @xmath87 events , originated from this source , is only five times less than the expected number of truly signal events . but the decay topology for this decay chain is drastically different ( 1 + 5 , not 3 + 3 ) and therefore it is unexpected that significant amount of the b - decays will be simulated in this way .",
    "+ note that even for @xmath88 decay channel the similar background is negligible @xcite , although @xmath89 is about 44 times bigger than @xmath90 .",
    "* @xmath91 .",
    "about 10 000 such events were generated by pythia and then analyzed .",
    "using br(@xmath92 from @xcite and assuming that @xmath93 decay goes through @xmath94 oscillations : @xmath95 , and therefore @xmath96 , we have got fig.4 .",
    "it is seen from this figure that because of @xmath97 mass shift , the contribution of this channel to the background proves to be negligible . + note that fig.4 refers to the total number of the @xmath91 events .",
    "in fact the distribution of these events with regard to the decay proper time is oscillatory , @xmath98 ( not @xmath26 ) defining the oscillation frequency .",
    "so in general this will result in oscillatory dilution factor .",
    "the conclusion that this dilution factor is irrelevent relies on the fact that no candidate event was found with invariant mass within one standard deviation from the @xmath1 mass for @xmath99 integrated luminosity .",
    "a huge monte - carlo statistics is needed for combinatorial background studies . no candidate event with @xmath100",
    "was found within @xmath101 inclusive @xmath102 events .",
    "this indicates that signal / background ratio is expected to be not worse than 1:1 .",
    "the observation of the @xmath103 oscillations is complicated by some dilution factors .",
    "first of all the decay proper time is measured with some accuracy @xmath104 . from previous discussions we know that in our case @xmath105 is expected . due to this finite time resolution ,",
    "the observed oscillations are convolutions of the expressions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) given above with a gaussian distribution .",
    "for example @xmath106 } \\frac{ds}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma } \\sim \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2 } e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{\\hbar}}\\left ( \\cosh{\\frac{\\delta \\gamma } { 2\\hbar}}(t-\\sigma \\frac{\\sigma}{\\tau})-d_{time}\\cos { \\frac{\\delta m}{\\hbar}(t-\\sigma \\frac{\\sigma}{\\tau } ) } \\right ) \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{eq9 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 } , ~\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\gamma}$ ] .",
    "so the main effect of this smearing is the reduction of the oscillation amplitude by @xmath108 .",
    "this is quite important in the @xmath1 system where @xmath109 .",
    "there is also a time shift @xmath110 in ( 9 ) .",
    "this time shift does not really effect the observability of the oscillations and we will neglect it .    in fact ( 9 ) is valid only for not too short decay times @xmath111 , because in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) distributions @xmath112 is assumed .",
    "another reduction in the oscillation amplitude is caused by the particle/ antiparticle mistagging at t=0 . in our case particle / antiparticle nature of the @xmath16 meson",
    "is tagged by the lepton charge in the semileptonic decay of the associated beauty hadron .",
    "mistagging is mainly due to    * @xmath113 oscillations : accompanying b - quark can be hadronized as a neutral @xmath16 meson and oscillate into @xmath114 before semileptonic decay .",
    "* @xmath115 cascade process , then the lepton is misidentified as having come directly from the @xmath16-meson and associated to the @xmath116 decay .",
    "* leptons coming from other decaying particles ( k,@xmath117 , ... ) .",
    "* detector error in the lepton charge identification .",
    "let @xmath118 be the mistagging probability .",
    "if we have tagged @xmath119 @xmath3 mesons , among them only @xmath120 are indeed @xmath3-s and @xmath121 are @xmath4-s misidentified as @xmath3-s .",
    "so at the proper time @xmath10 we would observe ( @xmath122 due to cpt invariance ) @xmath123= \\frac{n}{2}e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{\\hbar } } \\left [ \\cosh{\\frac{\\delta \\gamma t}{2\\hbar}}-(1 - 2\\eta ) \\cos { \\frac{\\delta m \\ , t}{\\hbar } } \\right ] \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] decays associated to the @xmath4 meson and therefore @xmath124 \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ] so the dilution factor due to mistagging is @xmath125 . in our studies",
    "we have taken @xmath126 , as in @xcite .",
    "finally the dilution can emerge from background .",
    "suppose that apart from @xmath127 events with @xmath128 oscillations we also have @xmath129 additional background events .",
    "half of them will simulate @xmath114 meson and half of them b meson ( assuming asymmetry free background ) .",
    "so the observed number of would be @xmath128 oscillations will be @xmath130 and the oscillation amplitude will be reduced by an amount @xmath131 neglecting the proper time dependence of this dilution factor ( that is supposing that the background is mainly due to @xmath16-hadron decays and therefore has approximately the same proper time exponential decay as the signal @xcite),we have taken @xmath132 which corresponds to the 2:1 signal / background ratio .",
    "for @xmath133 integrated luminosity the number of reconstructed @xmath19-s would reach @xmath134 from the analyzed channel alone . another @xmath135-s",
    "are expected from the @xmath136 channel @xcite .    for events in which @xmath19 meson does not oscillate before its decay , the @xmath137 meson and the tagging muon have equal sign charges .",
    "if the @xmath19 meson oscillates , opposite charge combination emerges .",
    "the corresponding decay time distributions are @xmath138 d is the product of all dilution factors and @xmath119 is the total number of reconstructed @xmath19-s .",
    "the unification of samples from @xmath73 and @xmath80 decay channels allows to increase @xmath26 measurement precision .",
    "fig.7 and fig.8 show the corresponding @xmath139 asymmetry plots for @xmath140 and 35 .",
    "it seems to us that @xmath141 decay channel is almost as good for the @xmath1-mixing exploration as previously studied @xmath142 and enables us to increase signal statistics about 1.5 times .",
    "further gain in signal statistics can be reached @xcite by using @xmath143 decay mode and considering other decay channels of @xmath60 .",
    "these possibilities are under study .",
    "we refrain from giving any particular value of @xmath26 as an attainable upper limit .",
    "too many uncertainties are left before a real experiment will start .",
    "note , for example , that about two times bigger branching ratios for both @xmath144 and @xmath145 decay channels are predicted in @xcite .",
    "@xmath146 as a @xmath147 production cross section can also have significant variation in real life @xcite .",
    "so although the results of this investigation strengthen confidence in reaching @xmath26 as high as 40 @xcite , it should be realized that some theoretical predictions about @xmath1-physics and collider operation were involved and according to t.d.lees first law of physicist @xcite `` without experimentalist , theorist tend to drift '' .",
    "however maybe it is worthwhile to recall his second law also `` without theorist , experimentalists tend to falter '' .",
    "many suggestions of p.eerola strongly influenced this investigation and lead to considerable improvement of the paper .",
    "communications with s.gadomski and n.ellis are also appreciated .",
