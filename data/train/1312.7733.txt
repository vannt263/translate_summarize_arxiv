    "the understanding of irreversible phenomena including nonequilibrium ( ne ) steady state is a long - standing problem of quantum statistical mechanics . with the recent experimental developments , it is now possible to measure the transport properties through nanoscale systems",
    ". these can be either the electronic charge transport or heat transport . both properties , i.e. thermoelectric transport",
    ", have recently been measured simultaneously @xcite .",
    "such properties exhibit many important new features in comparison with conduction through macroscopic systems .",
    "in particular , the interactions , such as coulomb interaction between electrons and scattering from atomic vibrations , become critically important in nanoscale objects , especially in single organic molecules @xcite    modelling such transport properties is still a challenge since one needs to be able to describe the system at the atomic level in a realistic manner , and one needs to use a formalism for the quantum transport that takes full account of the ne conditions ( full nonlinear response ) and the many - body ( mb ) interaction .",
    "nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf ) seems , at the present moment , the best way to tackle the problem .",
    "however , negf calculations for realistic systems are difficult to achieve , beyond mean - field - like approximations or quasi - equilibrium regime , since the calculations of the mb effects for a large number of electronic ( and vibronic ) degrees of freedom are extremely demanding",
    ". alternatively , the density - functional ( df)-based theories can handle large systems , but unfortunately treat the interaction ( between electrons for example ) on a mean - field - like basis and the corresponding functionals are not necessarily optimized , or even valid , for the ne conditions .    in this paper , we present an alternative approach based on the use of ne distribution and spectral functions . on one hand ,",
    "such an approach is , in principle , strictly equivalent to the steady - state negf technique , since there is a one - to - one equivalence between the green s functions ( gf ) and the ne distribution and spectral functions .",
    "one the other hand , approximations for the mb effects ( in the presence of ne conditions ) seems to be more easily introduced in the ne distribution , while keeping a clear physical interpretation .",
    "furthermore the use of approximated ne distributions may offer an alternative approach for future implementations in df - based calculations for large systems .    in earlier studies",
    ", we have already started developing and using the concept of ne distribution functions .",
    "this was done in a critical analysis of the applicability of landauer formalism for ne current in the presence of interactions @xcite , and in the study of the ne charge susceptibility and its relation with the nonlinear dynamical conductance @xcite .    in this paper , we develop in detail our approach using ne distribution and spectral functions , and provide numerical applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ness ] , we define the general steady state transport set - up .",

    "[ sec : numerics ] where we show examples of the ne distributions for a model of electron - phonon interacting system .",
    "the performance of the exact and approximated ne distributions are studied in this section .",
    "the generalisation of our approach to more realistic systems are provided in sec . [",
    "sec : realistic ] .",
    "finally we comment our results and conclude our study in sec .",
    "[ sec : ccl ] .",
    "we consider a system consisting of a central region @xmath0 connected to two non - interacting fermi seas .",
    "the left ( @xmath1 ) and right ( @xmath2 ) electrodes are at their own equilibrium , with a fermi distribution @xmath3 defined by their respective chemical potentials @xmath4 and temperatures @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the central region @xmath0 connected to the leads contain interaction characterized by a self - energy @xmath7 in the negf formalism .",
    "furthermore the specific model used for the leads does not need to be specified at the moment , as long as the leads can also be described by an embedding self - energy @xmath8 in the electron gf of the central region .",
    "the possibility of reaching a steady state regime in such a two - terminal device has been explored by many authors . the full time - dependent negf formalism and the influence of bound states in the central region",
    "have been studied in refs .",
    "rigorous mathematical methods based on the @xmath9 algebra have been used to study the existence and stability of such ne steady state , i.e. , its independence of the way the division into subsystems and reservoirs is performed and its stability against local perturbations , in the absence @xcite and in the presence of interaction @xcite .    for an established steady state regime",
    ", it is expected that some formal advantages may be given by an approach to ne processes in which the gibbs - like ensembles play a prominent role .",
    "the construction of such gibbs - like ensembles for the ne steady state can be obtained either by using the maclennan - zubarev approaches @xcite or the ne density matrix approach developed by hershfield in ref .",
    "the latter has been extensively used for calculating quantum electron transport properties , with or without interaction @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we show that the ne statistics of the open quantum system , i.e. the central region @xmath0 contains , information not only of the ne conditions but also about the mb interaction .",
    "we now consider a model for the central region made of a single electron level in the presence of interaction . in this section",
    "all quantities are either real or complex number functions of a single energy argument .      in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have shown , using maclennan - zubarev and hershfield approaches , that the steady state can be interpreted as an effective equilibrium state with a corresponding ne density matrix , or equivalently , with a corresponding ne statistics .",
    "such a ne statistic can be defined by a ne distribution function @xmath11 .",
    "it enters the relation between the different gfs defined in the central region @xmath0 as follows : @xmath12 with @xmath13 and with @xmath14 .",
    "we recall that the spectral function @xmath15 of the central region is obtained from @xmath16 .",
    "( [ eq : gf_and_fne ] ) bears resemblance with the so - called kadanoff - baym ansatz @xcite , but as we have shown in ref . [ ] , it is a strictly exact result for the steady state regime .    at equilibrium , @xmath10 is simply the fermi distribution @xmath17 .",
    "out of equilibrium , the distribution function will depend on the set - up , i.e. on the forces driving the system ( gradient of chemical potential and/or temperature between the leads ) , and on the interaction present in the region @xmath0 .    in the absence of interaction ,",
    "the ne distribution function for the electron is simply given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spectral function of the embedding ( lead @xmath20 ) self - energy .",
    "it is simply a double - step function , with more or less steep steps ( depending on the temperature @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) located around @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and separated by @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the applied bias ) .    in the presence of interaction in the central region @xmath0 ,",
    "the ne distribution is given by @xcite @xmath27 using the definitions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , we obtain : @xmath31    eq .  ( [ eq : fne ] ) is the `` universal '' expression of the electron ne distribution function . it is universal with respect to the interaction , in the same sense that the gfs have an universal expression via the use of the interaction self - energies . however , as expected for ne conditions , the ne distribution function is not as universal as its equilibrium counterpart , since it depends on both the set - up that drives the system out of equilibrium ( via @xmath32 ) and on the mb interaction @xmath33 ( which are themselves dependent on the ne conditions ) .",
    "we comment more on these properties in appendix [ app : fne_withwithout_inter ] .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fne ] ) , we can see that the ne distribution @xmath10 arises from two terms @xmath34 a dynamically renormalized distribution @xmath35 , with the renormalisation @xmath36 given by the sum of the spectral functions of the leads @xmath37 and of the interaction @xmath38 , and an extra term @xmath39 corresponding to the inelastic processes given by @xmath40 , and renormalised by the same factor @xmath36 .    the non - interacting distribution @xmath32 is formed by two fermi - dirac distributions shifted by the bias @xmath26 .",
    "however , the full ne distribution presents richer features ( peaks and dips ) characteristics of the electron population redistribution arising from both the ne and interaction effects .",
    "one can obtain both accumulation or depletion ( i.e. population inversion ) in some energy windows , such features in the ne distribution provide information about the efficiency of relaxation / equilibration processes in the system .",
    "furthermore , another important property of the ne distribution @xmath10 is related to its functional form .",
    "indeed , any feynmann diagrams for the interaction self - energy @xmath41 ( taken at any order and for electron - electron e - e or electron - phonon e - ph interaction ) is expressed in terms of the different electron gfs and phonon gfs .",
    "the renormalisation of the phonon gfs , if present , is also obtained from another set of diagrams using the electron gfs ( in the case of e - ph interaction ) .    since all gfs ( either the retarded , the advanced or the lesser , the greater , or the ( anti)time - order ) can be expressed in terms of spectral function @xmath42 alone or in terms of both the spectral function and the ne distribution , see eq.([eq : gf_and_fne ] ) ,",
    "any self - energy is a functional of the spectral functions and of the ne distribution function . in appendix [ app : fne_functional ] , we show explicitly how such a functional dependence is obtained by considering different lowest - order diagrams for the self - energies in case of both e - e and e - ph interaction .    therefore , from the general expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : fne ] ) defining @xmath10 , we can conclude that @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath10 is a functional of itself and of the spectral function permits us to devise an approach to solve self - consistently the problem by using an iterative scheme .",
    "such a scheme is developed in the next section and bears resemblance with conventional self - consistent negf calculations .",
    "the method we present in this section has however some advantages compared to conventional negf calculations .",
    "first of all , we are now dealing with two real functions @xmath11 and @xmath15 instead of complex number functions for the gfs .",
    "more importantly these two functions have well behaved ( for numerical purposes ) asymptotic limits : the spectral function @xmath15 has a finite energy - support , i.e. @xmath44 for @xmath45 $ ] otherwise @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 where the energy domain @xmath51 is roughly the bias window @xmath52 \\pm$ ] several @xmath53 .",
    "hence by using only @xmath11 and @xmath15 , we avoid having to deal with the slow decaying behaviour in @xmath54 of the real part of the advanced and retarded gfs and self - energies .",
    "such slow decay in @xmath54 comes from the fourier transform of the heavyside function defining the causality in the retarded ( the anti - causality in the advanced ) quantities .",
    "we are not obliged to work with large ( i.e. long ranged ) energy grids . in principle , one should work with a grid larger than @xmath51 in order to include the possible effects of `` hot electrons '' excited well above the bias window due to the interaction . in practice",
    ", we have found that the energy grid could be only the support of the spectral function @xmath55 $ ] .      the algorithm to perform ne steady state calculations",
    "is as follows :    * start with an initial ( @xmath56 ) spectral function @xmath57 and ne distribution @xmath58 , for example those corresponding to the non - interacting case : @xmath59 and @xmath60 . *",
    "calculate the corresponding initial self - energies @xmath61 for the chosen model of mb interaction .",
    "* calculate the next iteration ne distribution @xmath62 from eq .",

    "* ensure normalisation of @xmath78 when using approximated functionals for the ne distribution such as @xmath79 or @xmath80 ( see below ) .",
    "* repeat the iteration process , from step 3- , until the desired convergence is achieved ( either for the ne distribution @xmath81 or for the spectral function @xmath82 or for both ) .",
    "it should be noted that , similarly to the spectral functions , the spectral `` densities '' of the self - energy of the leads @xmath83 , and of the interaction self - energy @xmath84 are bounded , i.e. there have zero values outside an energy interval which is roughly the same as @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "hence we do not have to worry about the long - ranged dependence in @xmath54 of the real part of @xmath70 ; and we recover spectral functions @xmath82 which exist only on a finite energy - support .    furthermore _ method ( a ) _ for the calculation of the spectral function",
    "presents the great advantage of being extremely simple , in comparison to _ method ( b ) _ @xcite .",
    "however , we have noticed that , in some cases when the initial spectral function of the iterative loop is too different from the expected result , the convergence process might be slower ( if not possible at all ) for _ method ( a ) _ than for _ method ( b)_. hence _ method ( b ) _ appears to be more robust upon the choice of the initial conditions .",
    "it is entirely possible to combined both schemes in the same algorithm , starting first with _",
    "method ( b ) _ and when some degree of convergence is reached switching to _ method ( a ) _ to obtain a more accurate level of convergence .",
    "the method devised in the previous section can appear at first glance as just another reformulation of conventional negf calculations .",
    "one performs calculations with another set of two independent ( but inter - related ) functions : the ne distribution @xmath10 and the spectral function @xmath42 . in conventional negf technique , one deals instead with the two independent gfs @xmath85 and @xmath86 . as mentioned above",
    ", there is indeed a one - to - one correspondence between these two sets of functions .",
    "however , our method offers many advantages and not only on the numerical point of view as explained previously .",
    "indeed , as the ne distribution is a functional of itself and of the spectral function , it offers a more direct and natural way of performing approximated calculations , by considering some specific subsets of inelastic processes .",
    "such approximations are advantageous to minimize the computational cost of the calculations , which is an important point for future applications to large and more realistic systems .",
    "ultimately @xmath10 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fne ] ) , can be expressed as an infinite series expansion in terms of the non - interacting ne distribution @xmath32 , the spectral function @xmath42 and the interaction parameters ( @xmath87 or @xmath88 ) . therefore instead of performing the calculations with the exact expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : fne ] ) , we can always truncate the series expansion to a desired level of accuracy ( i.e. selecting a specific subset of inelastic processes ) , suitable for the system and the properties under study .",
    "we provide , in the next section , some example of approximated ne distributions and compare their performance against exact calculations using the full @xmath10 distribution .",
    "we recall that the latter are strictly equivalent to negf calculations ( with the same model of self - energies ) .",
    "we now consider numerical applications for a model of e - ph interacting system , and we test the different approximations available for the functional forms of the ne distribution .",
    "the hamiltonian for the region @xmath0 is @xmath89 where @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron in the molecular level @xmath92 .",
    "the electron is coupled , via its charge density @xmath93 , to the vibration mode ( phonon ) of energy @xmath94 and the strength of the coupling is given by the constant @xmath87 , and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) creates ( annihilates ) a quantum in the vibron mode @xmath94 .    for the transport set - up , the central region @xmath0",

    "the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the on - site and off - diagonal elements of the tight - binding chains .",
    "with such a choice of lead self - energy , we go beyond the wideband limit ( unless @xmath104 is much larger than any other parameters ) .",
    "the self - energies @xmath41 for the interaction between the electron and the vibration mode are calculated using the born approximation @xcite .",
    "their expressions are given in appendix [ app : scba ] .",

    "[ sec : algo ] are strictly equivalent to conventional negf calculations .",
    "hence the results obtained for @xmath10 with our method ( and full self - consistency ) are equal to those obtained from negf - scba calculations @xcite .",

    "more interestingly , the results obtained with the loe approximated distribution @xmath79 also give a good representation of the iets signal , even for a coupling strength @xmath143 .",
    "we interpret such a behaviour in the following manner : for small applied bias , where the transport is mostly tunneling and away from any resonant transport mechanisms , the loe distribution @xmath79 is still realistic ( i.e. @xmath144 ) and quite close to the distribution @xmath80 .",
