    "with the observation of the higgs boson  @xcite , the particle content of the electroweak standard model ( sm ) is confirmed by the experiments . in the future",
    "the main mission of large hedron collider ( lhc ) is to measure the interactions involving higgs precisely and search for the signatures of new physics ( np ) . among all the np models ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the most competitive candidates .",
    "it provides a natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem in the sm and realizes the gauge coupling unification which strongly suggests grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "however , in guts there generically exists the doublet - triplet splitting problem and dimension - five proton decay problem .",
    "fortunately , the flipped @xmath2 model  @xcite could elegantly solve these problems via missing partner mechanism  @xcite . in order to explain the little hierarchy problem between the traditional gut scale and string scale , one of us ( tl ) with jiang and nanopoulos proposed the testable flipped @xmath2 model , dubbed as @xmath3-@xmath4  @xcite , in which the tev - scale vector - like particles ( vlp ) were introduced  @xcite .",
    "such kind of models can be constructed from the free fermionic string constructions at the kac - moody level one  @xcite and from the local f - theory model  @xcite .",
    "these models are very interesting from the phenomenological point of view  @xcite : the vlps could be observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , proton decay is within the reach of the future hyper - kamiokande  @xcite and deep underground science and engineering laboratory ( dusel )  @xcite experiments  @xcite , the hybrid inflation could be realized naturally , the correct cosmic primordial density fluctuations could be got  @xcite , and the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass could be lifted  @xcite , etc . with no - scale boundary conditions at @xmath5 unification scale  @xcite , one of us ( tl ) with maxin , nanopoulos and walker have found an extraordinarily constrained `` golden point ''  @xcite and `` golden strip ''  @xcite that satisfied all the latest experimental constraints and has an imminently observable proton decay rate  @xcite . for a review of the recent progresses , please see ref .",
    "@xcite .    with the tev - scale vlps",
    ", the @xmath3-@xmath4 model is different from the mssm at low energy .",
    "for example , there exist non - decoupling effects in the quark and lepton sectors , comparing with the two higgs doublet ( 2hd ) model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the b physics processes in the quark sector of the @xmath3-@xmath4 model , including the quark mass spectra , feynman rules , new operators and wilson coefficients .",
    "we found that rich vlp phenomenology needs to be studied further , in addition to the other effects of vlps studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will extend our previous study and add vector - like particle multiplets to the mssm , dubbing as the mssmv . in order to show the physics of vlps more clearly , we concentrate on the changes compared with the mssm .",
    "it is well - known that only yukawa interactions generate the masses for quarks and leptons in both the sm and mssm .",
    "however , if there are vlps in models , the fermions could obtain their vector - like masses via the additional bilinear mass terms .",
    "the interaction vertices will be changed as well , so the feynman rules and mass spectra are different from the mssm .",
    "we will discuss their implications on loop corrections to the higgs mass , ( partial ) decoupling suppression of fermion and sfermion sector , and whether there exist the non - decoupling effects at the ew scale , etc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . a brief description of our model , the mass matrices of all particles , and all feynman rules of fermions and sfermions are presented in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "section  [ sec : mass ] includes a complete analytical formula of the leading order one - loop correction to the higg mass in the mssmv in the on - shell renormalization scheme , and some numerical analyses .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is our summary .",
    "in this subsection , we present a brief description of the mssmv .",
    "in addition to all the particles in the mssm , we introduce two sets of vector - like quarks and leptons ( one set with @xmath6 ahead , the other set with @xmath7 ahead ) and they have opposite sm quantum numbers , as given in table  [ table : vlp ]  .        g.  aad _ et al . _ [ atlas collaboration ] , phys .  lett .",

    "<S> [ sec : abs ] in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with additional vector - like particles ( vlps ) , we for the first time derive the particle mass spectra and the feynman rules , as well as analytically calculate the one - loop contributions to the higgs boson mass from the fermions and sfermions . after discussing and numerically analysing a cases without bilinear terms and a case with a ( partial ) decoupling limit </S>",
    "<S> , we find : ( i ) the corrections depend on the mass splittings between quarks and squarks and between vector - like fermions and their sfermions ; ( ii ) there exists the ( partial ) decoupling limit , where the vlps decouple from the electrwoeak ( ew ) energy scale , even when one of the vlps is light around the ew scale . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the contributions to higgs mass can be suppressed by the ( or partial ) decoupling effects , which can make the ew phenomenology very different from the mssm ; ( iii ) the sm - like higgs boson with mass around  @xmath0  gev gives strong constraints on the vlps if the top squarks are around  @xmath1  tev . </S>",
