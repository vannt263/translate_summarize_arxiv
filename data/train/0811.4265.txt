    "rotation is a very natural source of vorticity : when a glass of water is stirred , a vortex appears at the center .",
    "such a vortex is a singularity of the water current and it is of the same type as the vortex that appears above a sink .",
    "when a glass of water is put into uniform rotation , for instance by placing it on a turntable , the water current vanishes at the rotation axis but is not singular .",

    "vortices appear only if the rotation frequency exceeds a certain critical value and their number increases if the rotation frequency is further increased .",

    "an optical vortex is a singularity of the phase of an optical beam and is characterized by its position in the transverse plane , its topological charge and its morphology .",
    "the vortex charge is determined by the total phase change @xmath0 along a contour around the vortex center and must be integer for reasons of continuity . as opposed to the vortices that appear in superfluids and bose - einstein condensates , optical vortices can be elliptical ; their morphology is characterized by the partial derivatives of the beam profile close to the vortex center and can be represented by a point on a sphere @xcite .",
    "the polar angle on the sphere determines the degree of ellipticity while the azimuth angle fixes the orientation in the transverse plane .",
    "the interplay between astigmatism and the propagation of optical vortices may give rise to very rich behaviour @xcite .",

    ", the above - mentioned examples of rotationally - induced vortices in material systems raise the question if and how rotation induces vorticity in light fields . in this paper",
    "we address this topic by studying the optical properties of a two - mirror cavity that is put into rotation about its optical axis . this set - up is schematically drawn in fig [ cavity ]",
    "we expect an effect of rotation only if the cavity lacks rotational symmetry . in analogy with the rotating elliptical potential in which bose - einstein condensates can be trapped , we break the rotational symmetry by taking at least one of the mirrors cylindrical or astigmatic . in the absence of rotation ,",
    "such a cavity has astigmatic hermite - gaussian modes @xcite , which have lines of zero intensity ( line dislocations ) in the transverse plane .",
    "we show that rotation deforms the cavity modes into generalized gaussian modes @xcite and that the line dislocations are deformed into optical vortices ( point singularities in the transverse plane ) .",
    "we study the properties of these rotationally - induced optical vortices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the propagation of optical fields through time - dependent systems and focus on the specific case of a rotating astigmatic cavity .",

    "we must account for effects that arise from the time dependence of the mirror settings .",

    "an interesting but open question is how rotation would affect the optical properties of a geometrically unstable cavity , especially when close to the rotationally induced transition from an unstable to a stable geometry .",
    "a geometrically unstable cavity is intrinsically lossy @xcite and the propagation of light inside an unstable cavity is dominated by diffraction at the sharp edges of the mirrors @xcite . both mathematically and physically",
    "this system is fundamentally different from the stable cavities that we have studied in this paper and it is not possible to apply or generalize our method to such a system .",
    "as opposed to a normal fluid , a spatially confined optical cavity mode attains vorticity when it is put into uniform rotation . in this respect , it has some similarity with superfluids and bose - einstein condensates .",
    "compared to those systems , however , optical beams have many more degrees of freedom to cope with rotation .",
    "the phase of bose - einstein condensates and superfluids is fixed by the broken gauge invariance . the only way in which such systems can attain orbital angular momentum , is by locally creating cylindrically symmetric vortices while keeping their phase fixed elsewhere . as a result , vortices appear only when the rotation frequency exceeds a certain threshold and the number of vortices increases when the rotation frequency is further increased . for optical cavity modes , on the other hand ,",
    "both the astigmatism of the phase and intensity patterns and the properties of the optical vortices are affected by rotation .",
    "both contribute to the orbital angular momentum @xcite , which typically increases with increasing values of the rotation frequency even though the number of vortices does in general not increase .    for typical values of the mirror separation ,",
    "the rotation frequency corresponding to the cavity round - trip time is in the _ mhz_-range .",
    "although mechanical rotation frequencies in this range are not experimentally feasible , there are several possible routes towards experimentally realizing a set - up that captures the essential features of a rotating astigmatic two - mirror cavity .",
    "mechanical vibration frequencies in the _ mhz_-range can be achieved by using a piezoelectric actuator . developing",
    "a similar device to simulate rotations at _ mhz_-frequencies is challenging but , at least in principle , not impossible .",
    "another possible way of realizing a set - up that is similar to the one that is discussed in this paper , is by applying a rotating astigmatic mode pattern , which can be constructed from its stationary doppler - shifted frequency components , to optically induce a rotating refractive - index pattern in a material with a kerr - nonlinearity .",
    "such a pattern could be used in transmission to realize a two - mirror cavity with a rotating lens .",
    "the optical properties of such a cavity could be observed by using a laser at another wave length . besides the dynamical realizations of the set - up",
    ", one could try to mimic the twisted mode propagation in the rotating frame by using image rotators . since it is essential that back and forth propagating modes are rotated in the same direction , a two - mirror cavity with an image rotator between the mirrors",
    "does not do the job .",
    "instead , one could use a ring resonator with four , pairwise identical , mirrors in which the light passes an image rotator after each mirror .",
    "although the settings of the optical elements in this set - up are time - independent it does capture the optical properties of a rotating two - mirror cavity .",
    "a difficulty with this set - up is that the clockwise and counterclockwise propagating modes are frequency degenerate . in a passive set - up one of the two modes",
    "can be selected by injecting light in one direction only . in an active realization of such a set - up",
    ", the degeneracy can be lifted by applying the polarization degree of freedom ."
