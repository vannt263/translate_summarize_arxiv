    "catalytic chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) is a widely used method for the production of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) by decomposition of hydrocarbons ( such as ch@xmath5 , c@xmath6h@xmath6 etc . ) or carbon monoxide on supported metal catalysts ( fe , ni , co , femo , etc . )",
    "despite numerous studies , the growth mechanism of nanotubes is still not well understood . among the most studied factors that control the growth process",
    "are the kinetics of carbon transport @xcite , the thermodynamics of the catalyst particles @xcite , and their interaction with substrates ( oxides or zeolites)@xcite .",
    "the vapor - liquid - solid ( vls ) model @xcite for the cnt growth by cvd implies that the catalytic particle should be in a liquid state which allows rapid diffusion of carbon atoms throughout the particle .",
    "the bulk diffusion of carbon through the metal nanoparticle is driven by concentration gradients @xcite , and it is considered to be the rate - limiting step in the growth of filaments or carbonaceous deposits @xcite .",
    "the activation energies ( @xmath71.2 - 1.8 ev ) measured for thermal cvd growth of nanofibers or nanotubes are consistent with those for the carbon diffusion through the corresponding metals@xcite , hence further supporting the bulk diffusion vls model .",
    "another mechanism , the surface - mediated carbon transport model , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the low temperature nanotube synthesis by plasma - enhanced cvd @xcite implies that the catalyst could be in a solid state .",
    "however , the temperature of the active nanoparticles is extremely difficult to measure during the growth process .",
    "in fact , the bombardment of energetic species in plasma and the exothermic dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbon can increase the local temperature of the catalyst , even if the substrate is kept in thermal equilibrium . this phenomenon can promote the surface melting of the nanoparticle and , concurrently , facilitate the growth of the nanotube @xcite .    because the overall catalytic capability of nanoparticles strongly depends on whether they are in the liquid or solid states ,",
    "their thermal behavior has been extensively investigated with experimental @xcite and theoretical means @xcite . under cvd",
    "experimental conditions , the melting temperatures of catalytic particles are strongly reduced because of the dissolved carbon ( _ liquidus _ and _ solidus _ slopes in the metal - c phase diagram ) and the relatively high surface energy with respect to the bulk materials ( gibbs - thomson phenomenon ) .",
    "unusually low melting points of 600 - 700@xmath8c have been observed for oversaturated solutions of carbon ( up to 50 at.% at 700@xmath8c ) in fe , ni , and co metals @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the fluidization of the metal catalytic particles at low or moderate temperature was attributed to the creation of highly dispersed unstable solutions oversaturated with carbon , with concentrations well above the limit of the stable carbide @xcite .    with so many factors influencing the catalytic growth of cnt , the role of the substrate on the thermal properties of the particle",
    "is often overlooked .",
    "in fact , there are experimental indications that the presence of substrate could be an important factor in the thermodynamics of the particle and in regulating the growth of nanotubes @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical research has been focused on the melting behavior of free - standing pure @xcite or bimetallic @xcite clusters .",
    "a phase diagram of free - standing fe - c clusters of fixed size ( @xmath9 nm ) has been recently calculated@xcite .",
    "there have been investigations performed on supported catalysts @xcite , showing that the cluster - substrate interaction strongly affects the melting temperature of particles and thus could influence the nanotube growth rate .",
    "a more general picture , capturing the particle - substrate interaction and size effects on the phase diagram , is still lacking and is the main subject of our study .    in this paper",
    "we investigate thermal behaviors for free and alumina - supported fe - c nanoparticles with molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . in section",
    "ii we describe the _ ab initio _ development of a simple interaction between fe and al@xmath6o@xmath10 which is essential for the calculations of supported clusters of reasonable sizes . in section iii , by using md simulations we explore the thermodynamics of fe nanoclusters and the phase diagrams of fe - c binary nanoparticles focusing on the effects of cluster s size and interfacial interactions on the thermal properties ( fe - c up to @xmath716% carbon concentration ) . in the same section",
    "we show that not only the eutectic temperature but also the eutectic composition are size- and substrate - dependent .",
    "section iv is devoted to the exploration of the peculiar characteristics of very small clusters .",
    "conclusions are described in section v.",
    "in this section we model the many - body fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction with a simple classical potential . if the calculation of this interaction energy involved the summation over all substrate atoms ( e.g. using modified charge transfer potential @xcite ) the simulation would be computationally very expensive ( a 200-atom nanoparticle would require a 1000-atom substrate patch ) . ideally , a suitable potential for md simulations would depend on three integral variables , or even one ( the distance from an iron atom to the surface ) if the potential corrugation is small .",
    "the validity of such simplification critically depends on how weak the fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction is compared to those of fe - fe and al@xmath6o@xmath10-al@xmath6o@xmath10 .",
    "there are three possible terminations for ( 0001 ) @xmath11-al@xmath6o@xmath10 surfaces@xcite : stoichiometric al - terminated , al - al - terminated ( two top al layers ) , and o - terminated .",
    "these are depicted in figure [ label_fig01](a ) .",
    "theoretical calculations have predicted that the most stable surface is the stoichiometric one , terminated by a single layer of al @xcite .",
    "this type of surface is also believed to be the most often observed under ultra high vacuum conditions @xcite .",
    "therefore in this work we will restrict our analysis of fe over al@xmath6o@xmath10 using only the stable stoichiometric al - termination .      to develop the interaction between fe clusters and al@xmath6o@xmath10 surfaces , we perform density functional theory _",
    "ab initio _ calculations with vienna ab - initio simulation package vasp @xcite with projector augmented waves ( paw ) @xcite and exchange - correlation functionals as parameterized by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite for the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "simulations are carried out at zero temperature , with spin polarization and without zero - point motion .",
    "we use an energy cutoff of 500 ev and a @xmath12 @xmath13-point monkhorst - pack mesh @xcite . the force tolerance for structural relaxation",
    "is set to 0.1 ev /  .",
    "the unit cell is hexagonal with lattice parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15  .",
    "the length of the lattice vector normal to surface is kept large enough to minimize the neighboring supercell interaction . vertically , there is at least 12   of empty space .",
    "in addition , a dipole layer is applied in _",
    "z_-direction to minimize electrostatic effects .",
    "a schematic of the unit cell is shown in figure [ label_fig01](b ) .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters of the bulk alumina ( space - group # 167 ) with a hexagonal unit cell ( _ hr30 _ ) , @xmath14   and @xmath16  , are in good agreement with the experimental values , @xmath17   and @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "our @xmath11-al@xmath6o@xmath10 slab consists of four oxygen layers as shown in figure [ label_fig01](b ) .",
    "the structure is relaxed from the bulk @xmath11-al@xmath6o@xmath10 configuration while keeping one oxygen and one aluminum layers at the bottom frozen .",
    "the surface undergoes considerable relaxations : the interlayer spacings for the top four layers become @xmath19 and 0.264  , differing from the corresponding bulk values by -87.3% , 7.8% , -47.1% , and 22.1 % , respectively .",
    "these values compare well with the previous 18 oxygen - layer simulations ( - 87.4% , 3.1% , -41.7% , 18.9% ) @xcite , suggesting that an alumina slab with four layers of oxygen is thick enough to be a realistic model of the al@xmath6o@xmath10 surface . on the top of the relaxed @xmath11-al@xmath6o@xmath10 substrate we place a few close - packed layers of iron while keeping the in - plane lattice vectors of fe identical to the bulk value of alumina . because of the fortunate match between the natural fe and the @xmath11-al@xmath6o@xmath10 surface lattice spacings ( within 3% ) ,",
    "the effect of the interface strain energy on the total binding is insignificant .",
    "close - packed iron layers can be put in different ways on top of alumina .",
    "thus , we consider the two high symmetry positions labeled as `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' in figure [ label_fig01](c ) .",
    "the binding energy between one fe column ( one fe per layer ) and al@xmath6o@xmath10 is defined as @xmath20}-e_{fe}\\right ] ,    \\label{label_equation_eb_definition}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the total energy of the optimized system , @xmath22}$ ] and @xmath23 are the energies of the relaxed al@xmath6o@xmath10 slab and fe layers , respectively ( note that the factor @xmath24 appears because there are four fe per adsorbed layer ) .",
    "the presence of adsorbed fe strongly modifies the alumina surface , and the deformation of the surface may affect the total binding considerably . to evaluate this effect",
    ", we define the substrate deformation energy as @xmath25}-e_{relaxed[al_2o_3]}\\right ] ,    \\label{label_equation_edeform_definition}\\ ] ] where @xmath26}$ ] is the energy of an artificially isolated alumina slab with the same geometry as that of the optimized fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 system but without adsorbed iron .",
    "figure [ label_fig02 ] shows a schematic of the definitions of the two energies , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in our calculations",
    "only the surface is allowed to relax : iron atoms are kept at their ideal positions because we assume that a reliable fe - fe interaction ( e.g. born - mayer potential @xcite ) will be able to properly describe their energetics .    to determine how many layers of fe must be included in the calculations , we evaluate the fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction for systems with different number of fe layers situated at the same distance above the alumina surface . as summarized in table [ label_table_1 ] , the binding energy converges reasonably well once the iron film contains three or more layers .",
    "therefore , we limit our calculations to the absorption of only three fe layers . in addition , due to the corrugation of the surface , the binding energy depends on where the adsorbants are positioned in the _ x - y _ plane . figure [ label_fig01](c ) shows the two high symmetry configurations of the inner layer of adsorbed film .",
    "the corrugation , calculated as the difference between the binding energies of the most and least stable configurations ( position `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' in figure [ label_fig01](c ) , respectively ) , is less than 15% of the total energy .",
    "such little sensitivity to the lateral position of iron allows us to consider the surface essentially flat .    .",
    "the dependence of the binding energy on the thickness of close - packed fe structure with the closest layer located in position `` 1 '' of figure [ label_fig01](c ) . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure [ label_fig03](a ) shows the binding ( @xmath27 ) and deformation ( @xmath28 ) energies as a function of the distance @xmath29 from the surface . since the al@xmath6o@xmath10 slab experiences surface rearrangement",
    ", @xmath29 must be defined with respect to a fixed reference , in our case , the bottom of the unit cell ( see figure [ label_fig02 ] ) . for convenience",
    ", we use a constant shift @xmath30 to have the minimum of the interaction energy at a reasonable distance of 2.25  .",
    "the strong contribution of @xmath28 to @xmath27 , shown in figure [ label_fig03](a ) , is caused by the considerable rearrangement of the surface atoms to accommodate the absorbed iron .",
    "the origin of the non - monotonic variation of the deformation energy is clarified in fig .",
    "[ label_fig03](b ) , in which we show the vertical shifts of the outer al and o layers , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with respect to the o position when fe is not present ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the outer positively charged al layer first rises above the substrate to be closer to the approaching fe film and accept more charge ( as has been shown previously for the zr - terminated ni / zro@xmath6 system@xcite , the charge transfer between the outer zr and ni , as well as the accumulation of charge in the gap between them , is significant ) .",
    "the maximum rise for the al layer happens at the interlayer al - fe distance of 2.7 (@xmath29=2.8   in fig .",
    "[ label_fig03](b ) ) , which corresponds to the kink in the deformation energy curve .",
    "after that point , both al and o layers are pushed downwards . for @xmath34  , one can also expect noticeable deformation of the fe film , and the decomposition of the total fe binding into the independent fe - fe and fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 contributions may not be accurate anymore .",
    "the _ ab initio _ binding energy can be decomposed as a sum of contributions from each atom in the fe `` column '' ( assuming that the many - body fe - fe effects are appropriately described by an external interaction ) : @xmath35 where the energy per atom @xmath36 is taken to be a simple morse potential@xcite as : @xmath37}-2\\exp{\\left[-\\alpha\\left(z_{i}-z_{0}\\right)\\right]}\\right\\ }    \\label{label_equation_02}\\ ] ] fitting gives @xmath38 mev , @xmath39 @xmath40 , and @xmath41  .",
    "figure [ label_fig03](a ) shows the fit of @xmath27 calculated as a sum of three morse interactions .",
    "the strength of the fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction ( 153 mev ) amounts to only @xmath710% of the fe - fe interlayer binding energy ( @xmath71.24 - 1.42 ev , depending on the thickness of the fe film ) , which implies that the latter is not significantly affected by the presence of the substrate .",
    "hence , the assumption of decomposing the total fe binding into the separate fe - fe and fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interactions is justified _",
    "a posteriori_. our simple fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 morse interaction naturally incorporates the whole alumina surface deformation , since the binding energy has been defined with respect to an ideal al@xmath6o@xmath10 slab and an isolated fe film , as described in equation ( [ label_equation_eb_definition ] ) and figure [ label_fig02 ] . within this framework ,",
    "md simulations on supported particles can be efficiently performed with reasonable accuracy by considering the @xmath29 component of the particle interaction with the flat substrate .",
    "as we are interested in the properties of binary fe@xmath0c@xmath1 nanoparticles , we need to evaluate the interaction between carbon surrounded by iron and the alumina substrate ( fe - embedded - c - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction ) . starting from three layers of adsorbed",
    "fe , we substitute one fe with one c atom bringing the concentration to @xmath428.3% . depending on the position in which the substitution takes place ,",
    "the binding energy fluctuates while remaining similar to , which suggests some importance of many - body effects in the fe - embedded - c - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction . because the substrate represents only a small perturbation to the total binding of the nanoparticle and the concentration of c in our simulations",
    "is small , we choose to treat the c - al@xmath6o@xmath10 and fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interactions in the same way , i.e. we use the fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 morse potential for both atom types .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been addressed by performing md simulations , similar to those described in section [ section.md ] , but here we vary the morse parameters for the c - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction .",
    "our tests for supported fe@xmath43c@xmath44 nanoparticles reveal that the thermodynamics of the systems is not very sensitive to the particular value of the c - al@xmath6o@xmath10 binding . for example , increasing or decreasing the strength of the c - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction for the fe@xmath43c@xmath44 nanoparticles by a factor of two changes the melting temperature by 1 - 2 % , the amount comparable to the statistical error of the melting temperature determination in our simulations(see section iii ) .",
    "we conclude that the simple approximation of employing the same description for the fe and c interactions with the substrate is suitable for this study .",
    "among the taxonomy of thermodynamics phenomena for nanoparticles , melting has been subject of considerable interest .",
    "the characteristics of the melting process depend on a variety of parameters such as size @xcite and shape of the particles @xcite , concentration of impurities @xcite , and presence of substrates @xcite .",

    ". to have a specific value of @xmath67 instead of a range , we define the melting temperature @xmath67 as the `` _ max - solid point _ '' which represents the maximum temperature at which the solid and the liquid phases coexist ( the locus of all the max - solid points is the liquidus ) . above @xmath67 , no solid phase is present .",

    "similarly , the _ min - liquid point _ is the minimum temperature at which the solid and the liquid phases coexist ( the locus of all the min - liquid points is the solidus ) . the difference between the energies of the particle at the max - solid and at the min - liquid points defines the enthalpy of melting @xmath68 .      with the aforementioned method , we investigate pure nanoparticles of size @xmath69 atoms ( diameter @xmath70 1 - 3 nm ) .",

    "if liquefaction was a prerequisite for catalytic activity , the small particles would begin to produce nanotubes earlier .",
    "experimental verification of this hypothesis is challenging : very small catalyst nanoparticles ( @xmath991 nm ) have a fast rate of coalescence during the reaction and coagulate to form bigger clusters @xcite . following the vls model , the growth of very small nanotubes using metallic catalyst would be possible only if the reaction temperature were above @xmath94 ( to liquefy the particle ) and below the temperature at which particles begin to coalesce .",
    "hence , controlling the diameter of nanotubes grown with cvd in the small size range might be difficult .",
    "so far , the smallest reported nanotube ( d = 4  , the most internal tube in a multiwalled nanotube ) has been grown by arc - discharge method without any metallic catalyst @xcite .    in the @xmath100 region , our results also show that once the dissolved carbon concentration reaches a point where the corresponding melting temperature ( from the phase diagram ) exceeds the reaction temperature , the particle starts solidifying as a two - phase system composed of solid carbide and fe - rich liquid .",
    "this solidification gradually reduces the average surface mobility of the catalytic species ( fe ) and might affect the catalytic activity of the nanoparticle . during the process of nanotube growth , conditions such as sufficient carbon concentration and temperature can induce the formation of stable carbides .",
    "cementite ( fe@xmath10c ) and other iron carbides have been observed in experiments after the reaction of hydrocarbon or carbon monoxide with iron catalysts @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that such stable carbides act as poison by terminating the growth of nanotube @xcite .",
    "in this section we analyze the structural properties of pure small fe clusters , free and supported on al@xmath6o@xmath10 .",
    "we find that as the size decreases fe clusters assume stable polyhedron configurations@xcite .",
    "the same md technique described in the previous section is adapted for searching the stable configurations of small clusters ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "twenty random configurations are generated per each size and optimized by annealing .",
    "the whole annealing process contains @xmath102 md iterations ( 10 ns ) .",
    "free and supported clusters are heated to 1200 k and 1400 k , respectively , before being slowly cooled to 0 k. among the twenty annealed structures , we consider the lowest energy configuration as the global minimum for each size . for free clusters with @xmath103 , the lowest 5 energies are nearly degenerate ( inset in fig .",
    "[ label_figure_10 ] ) which validates our approach . for bigger particles",
    "the found minima might be sub - optimal as the difficulty of finding the global minima rapidly increases .",
    "[ label_figure_10 ]    the minimum energies per atom are fitted to the @xmath104 dependence , where , in the case of spherical particles , the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 would represent the bulk energy per atom and the surface - creation destabilization energy cost , respectively @xcite .",
    "our fit uses only two parameters @xmath107 instead of the four of the more general formula @xmath108 @xcite to avoid overfitting due to the limited number of energy points .",
    "we include the best available minima obtained with the aforementioned procedure for bigger ( @xmath109 100 , 120 , 160 and 200 ) clusters to ensure the correct assymptotic behavior for the nanoparticles of large sizes . to capture the size dependence only we exlude sizes @xmath110 ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) from the fit , because these nanoparticls acheive additional stability by forming highly symmetric icosahedra ( see fig . [ label_figure_10 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath113 ev , @xmath114 ev and @xmath115 ev , @xmath116 ev for free and supported clusters , respectively .",
    "the two values of @xmath105 are very close to the bulk fcc cohesive energy of -4.29 ev / atom ; the two values of @xmath106 slightly differ because of the reduced total energy cost to create and modify surface for the supported cluster @xcite .",
    "figures [ label_figure_11 ] and [ label_figure_12 ] illustrate the differences between the calculated and the fitted energies for free and supported clusters .",
    "the prominent negative peaks in fig .",
    "[ label_figure_11 ] for sizes @xmath117 and @xmath118 correspond to the magic size structures in our sequence .",
    "the evolution of the nanoparticle configuration with size is depicted in the same picture . by comparing figures [ label_figure_11 ] with [ label_figure_12 ]",
    "we observe that the attractive substrate has little or no effect on the internal structure of small clusters ( @xmath119 ) . due to the spherical ( or nearly - spherical ) arrangements ,",
    "such small icosahedra are not significantly deformed by attractive substrates , unless the adsorption potentials is comparable to the internal atomic binding energy of the cluster .",
    "big supported particles behaves differently .",
    "in fact , as the size increases beyond @xmath120 , alumina - supported clusters form fcc arrangements ( fig . [ label_figure_12 ] ) with the \\{111 } planes at the particle / substrate interface . elsewhere",
    "the particles have simple close - packed facets or local arrangements of them .",
    "big unsupported particles are different than the supported ones .",
    "unsupported clusters of sizes between @xmath121 and @xmath122 have decahedra or icosahedra arrangements ( multi - twinned structures @xcite ) .",
    "decahedra are more frequent for medium size particles ( @xmath12370 to @xmath7100 ) while icosahedra appear more often for bigger sizes ( @xmath123100 to @xmath7200 ) .",
    "figure [ label_figure_11 ] shows three particular examples of decahedra clusters with @xmath124 , and 77 .",
    "as the size exceeds @xmath122 , the particles approach the bulk configuration and the fcc and icosahedra structures tend to become degenerate .",
    "for instance , the cluster at @xmath125 is a good example of an fcc particle with appropriate close - packed faceting and minimal surface - edge reorganization .",
    "the  that occurs at lower sizes for supported clusters can be explained in terms of surface / interface and elastic strain energies @xcite . in a groundstate configuration , the former ( latter )",
    "energy dominates over the other for a small ( big ) particle .",
    "particles with radii of @xmath126 ( @xmath127 is the critical size for the polyhedron - fcc transition @xcite ) tend to form polyhedral structures ( icosahedra or decahedra ) to minimize the surface / interface energy , while clusters with @xmath128 will prefer the bulk configuration ( fcc ) to minimize the elastic strain energy@xcite .",
    "this is true for free and supported clusters .",
    "however , for supported particles , the fcc configuration with flat facets ( along the directions of minimum surface energy given by the wulff plots @xcite ) has a larger contact area with the substrate than the polyhedra do .",
    "therefore , the attractive substrate interaction reduces the surface / interface energy of fcc the most , resulting in a lower critical @xmath127 ( even though the overall surface area of the fcc structures could be larger than that of the icosahedra ) .",
    "our simulations reveal that the substrate attractive interaction tends to preserve the bulk structure for small particles .",
    "this demonstrates that although the fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction is relatively weak , it is able to influence the balance between the bulk and surface energies in competing configurations and utlimately determine the particle s ground state .",
    "one can also expect to observe this effect in simulations with different models of the fe - fe and fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interactions , as long as their relative strength is comparable with ours .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the behavior of free and alumina - supported fe - c nanoparticles .",
    "we observe interesting phenomena that can be attributed to the presence of the substrate .",
    "the main results of the present study can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) the total fe binding can be conveniently decomposed into independent fe - fe and fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 parts : according to our _ ab initio _ calculations the two differ by about an order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the corrugation of the fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction is much smaller than the average adsorption energy .",
    "this allows us to parameterize the fe - al@xmath6o@xmath10 interaction as a morse potential , which includes the deformation energy of the substrate .",
    "\\(ii ) the thermal behavior of pure - fe particles is simulated with classical md techniques .",
    "we observe the reduction of melting temperature as a function of the diameter , in agreement with the gibbs - thomson law .",
    "we also show that supported particles have higher melting points than the unsupported ones .",
    "\\(iii ) we calculate the liquidi on the phase diagrams for a range of fe - c nanoparticles ( @xmath129 nm ) and show that they are characterized by the presence of eutectic points in which the eutectic concentration depends on the size of the particles .",
    "these phenomena may have important effects on the growth of carbon nanotubes by cvd , as discussed in section iii c.    \\(iv ) we find that the optimized configurations of very small pure fe clusters ( down to @xmath130 ) have icosahedron or decahedron structures .",
    "bigger clusters tend to have close - packed configurations .",
    "we show that the size at which the cluster undergoes the polyhedron@xmath131close - packed transition depends on the substrate . in particular , al@xmath6o@xmath10 supported fe clusters have @xmath132 while free cluster have @xmath133 .    the thermodynamic study of nanoparticles will be extended with future _",
    "ab initio _ characterizations carried out in this laboratory , and with experimental investigations performed by our collaborators .",
