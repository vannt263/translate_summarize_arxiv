    "the production of @xmath0 mesons is strongly suppressed compared to that of @xmath4 mesons .",
    "this fact is known under the name `` ozi rule''@xcite . according to the ozi rule @xmath0 mesons",
    "can only be produced due to a small admixture of non - strange light quarks in their wave function .",
    "the corresponding mixing angle @xmath7 is equal to @xmath8@xcite . according to this mixing angle",
    "the ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath4 mesons cross sections should at comparable energies naively be equal to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a correction due to the different phase space factors for @xmath0 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "experimentally , the ratio @xmath11 is in @xmath12 reactions , however , known to be one order of magnitude larger than the naive expectation @xcite .",
    "various models have been used as a framework for theoretical attempts to explain this large discrepancy , ranging from simple one - pion exchange models @xcite to more sophisticated effective lagrangian models @xcite . also the resonance model is successfully explaining the production of a large variety of mesons such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 in elementary nucleon - nucleon reactions @xcite . in the present note",
    "we extend the application of the resonance model to the description of @xmath0 meson production in @xmath13 collisions . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the resonance model and present the results for the @xmath0 meson production .",
    "then we discuss the results and conclude .",
    "the production of @xmath0 mesons is described by a two step mechanism , i.e. the excitaton of nucleon resonances and their subsequent decay @xmath14 .",
    "the cross sections for the resonance production were taken from ref.@xcite where they were fitted to describe @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 production in @xmath15 collisions .",
    "the @xmath16 coupling is obtained from the known @xmath17 coupling of the @xmath4 meson @xcite and the mixing angle between @xmath0 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "the @xmath17 couplings , in turn , have been determined within the framework of the extended vector meson dominance ( evmd ) model by fitting the available data on electro- and photo- production of nucleon resonances as well as their mesonic decays @xcite .",
    "the description of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 meson production in elementary nucleon - nucleon reactions is then essentially parameter free since all model parameters have already been fixed by other sources . in @xcite it was demonstrated that available data on the exclusive @xmath4 production in @xmath13 reactions are very accurately reproduced by the present model over a wide energy range , i.e. from extremely close to threshold up to several gev above threshold .",
    "the @xmath14 cross section is given as follows :    @xmath18    with @xmath19 being the running mass of @xmath0 meson .",
    "the cross sections for the baryon resonances production are given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the two - body phase space , @xmath22 the final c.m .",
    "momentum , @xmath23 the initial c.m .",
    "momentum . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the running and pole masses of the resonances , respectively , @xmath26 the proton mass .",
    "the mass distribution @xmath27 of the resonances is described by the standard breit - wigner formula : @xmath28 the sum in ( [ signnv ] ) runs over the same same set of nucleon resonances which is responsible for the @xmath4 meson production @xcite .",
    "this includes all well established ( 4@xmath29 ) @xmath30 resonances quoted by the pdg @xcite with masses below 2 gev .",
    "the branching to the @xmath0 decay mode is given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 calculated the same way as in the case of @xmath4 meson production@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 mass distribution @xmath33 is also described by a breit - wigner distribution , i.e. substituting @xmath34 and @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ bw ] ) .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath0 width @xmath36 can be calculated according to    @xmath37    important properties of the @xmath38 width are the following ones : the @xmath19 dependence of magnetic , electric and coulomb couplings entering into the amplitude and the blatt - weisskopf suppression factor which suppresses the width for large off - shell masses @xmath24 of the resonances @xcite .",
    "their combined effects lead to an increase of the @xmath38 width with @xmath19 increasing from @xmath39 to @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "this effect is finally responsible for the violation of the naive ozi rule estimate ( [ naive ] ) .",
    "the results for cross section @xmath42 are presented in fig . 1 in form of the ratio of the @xmath0 over @xmath4 meson production cross sections .",
    "the @xmath4 mesons production cross section was shown to agree well with experimental data if one uses a strong @xmath43 coupling @xcite .",
    "production from the total cross section since at the considered energies , i.e. above the @xmath0 meson production threshold , these contributions are less than 10@xmath44 of the total @xmath4 cross section . hence the effect that can be approximatly neglected . ] the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to the idealized case of stable @xmath0 and @xmath4 mesons , i.e. to the limit of zero widths .",
    "we have calculated the cross section for @xmath0 meson production in @xmath13 collision within the resonance model .",
    "the experimental data are well reproduced .",
    "the large violation of the ozi estimate for the @xmath0 over @xmath4 production , observed experimentally , is explained without introducing additional parameters into the present model .",
    "a further test of the resonance model could be provided by a comparison of @xmath45 distributions ( the distribution of the invariant mass of proton-@xmath0 meson system ) as soon as experimental data are available for this observable .",
