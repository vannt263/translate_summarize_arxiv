    "there has been a great deal of interest in the recent observation of a quite narrow resonance which decays to a nucleon and a kaon @xcite .",
    "these states have been interpreted as pentaquarks which are likely to have a @xmath1 structure @xcite .",
    "( the extremely narrow width of the state , the @xmath0 , has led some to question whether the state exists in nature . ) in the present work we will describe the calculation of the width of the @xmath0 in a relativistic quark model which includes a model of confinement that we have introduced previously in our study of meson and nucleon structure .    a number of reviews have appeared . in ref .",

    "we are particularly interested in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite in which a diquark - triquark model is introduced to describe the pentaquark .",
    "we will make use of a variant of that model in the present work , since that model lends itself to the analysis of the pentaquark decay using feynman diagrams .",
    "the diagram we consider is presented in fig .",
    "[ f333.1 ] . there",
    "the pentaquark is represented by the heavy line with momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the pentaquark is composed of a diquark of momentum @xmath3 and a triquark of momentum @xmath4 .",
    "the triquark emits a quark ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) which combines with the diquark to form a nucleon of momentum @xmath7 .",
    "the final - state kaon of momentum @xmath8 is emitted along with the quark at the triquark vertex .",
    "we have studied the structure of the nucleon in a quark - diquark model in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work we considered both scalar and axialvector diquarks , however , in this work",
    "we will limit our considerations to a nucleon composed of a quark and a scalar diquark .",
    "the nucleon vertex is described in ref .",

    "( we remark that in fig .",
    "[ f333.1 ] only the quark of momentum @xmath9 and the triquark of momentum @xmath4 will be off mass shell in our analysis . ) the mass of the scalar diquark was taken to be 400 mev in ref .",
    "we use that value here and also take the triquark to have a mass of 800 mev .",
    "therefore , it is clear that we need to introduce a model of confinement for the pentaquark which has a mass of 1540 mev .",
    "our ( covariant ) confinement model which we have used extensively in other works @xcite will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the organization of our work is as follows . in section",
    "ii we will describe our model of confinement and in section iii we will calculate the width of the pentaquark , assuming it has negative parity . in section",
    "iv we consider the width in the case the pentaquark has positive parity .",
    "finally , section v contains further discussion and conclusions .",
    "as stated in the last section , our pentaquark is composed of a scalar diquark of mass 400 mev and a triquark of mass 800 mev .",
    "since the mass of the pentaquark under consideration is 1540 mev , the pentaquark would decay into its constituents in the absence of a model of confinement .",
    "similarly , the nucleon of mass 939 mev could decay into the scalar diquark of mass 400 mev and a quark whose mass we take to be 350 mev in this work .    in earlier work",
    "we have introduced a confining interaction which served to prevent the decay of mesons or nucleons into their constituents .",
    "our covariant confinement model is described in a series of our papers @xcite . in that model",
    "we solve a linear equation for a confining vertex function , @xmath10 .",
    "this function has the following property .",
    "consider the decay @xmath11 , in which the hadrons @xmath12 and @xmath13 are on mass shell . if we include the confining vertex we find the amplitude has a zero when particle @xmath14 goes on mass shell , so that the amplitude for @xmath12 to decay into two on - mass - shell particles ( @xmath14 and @xmath13 ) is zero .",
    "for the decay @xmath11 we may introduce a wave function that may be expressed in terms of the momentum of the off - shell particle @xmath14 . if @xmath14 is a scalar , we have [ e333.2.1 ] _ b(k)=1k^2-m_b^2_b(k).note that the ratio of @xmath15 to @xmath16 is an ordinary function which may often be well represented by a gaussian function .",
