    "techniques in popular use in the nuclear three - body problem include the faddeev@xcite , green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) , and correlated hyper - spherical harmonics expansion methods ( see , for instance , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "these methods have been used with realistic phenomenological potentials ( _ e.g. _ av18@xcite , , cd - bonn@xcite , etc . . . ) with strong short - range interactions , yielding binding energies accurate to within @xmath5%@xcite .",
    "all of these methods treat the bare @xmath6 interactions in hilbert spaces that are effectively infinite .",
    "because the complexity of the hilbert spaces grows very rapidly with nucleon number a , the extension of such methods to heavier systems becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "this motivates another approach : solving a - body problems in more tractable finite `` included spaces , '' while accounting for the missing physics of the `` excluded space '' through an effective interaction . for shell - model - inspired effective theories",
    "that define included spaces in terms of harmonic oscillator ( ho ) bases , the missing physics includes both high - momentum and long - wavelength interactions .",
    "the former are missing because the included space contains only low - energy oscillator shells , while the latter are connected with the finite extent of the basis states , which are overconfined in an ho potential .",
    "shell - model calculations often employ two - body effective interactions , but these are generally determined phenomenologically . in recent years",
    "there has been growing success in calculating these effective interactions directly from the underlying bare interaction in a precise and systematic way ( _ e.g. _ refs.@xcite and references within ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend upon this work by calculating the more complicated @xmath7 that could be used in a shell - model - inspired effective theory , through three - body order in the excluded space .. the inclusion of three - body contributions is generally believed essential in building in the density dependence crucial to saturation .",
    "the exact effective interaction for the a - body problem is an a - body operator .",
    "the calculation of this interaction is clearly as difficult as solving the original a - body problem in an infinite hilbert space .",
    "however , there are reasons to hope that such an a - body calculation might be unnecessary .",
    "this hope depends on the plausible notion that the effective interaction might converge as an expansion in the number of nucleons interacting in the excluded space .",
    "were such an expansion to converge at the three- or four - body cluster level , then standard three- or four - body methods could be used to treat the excluded space .",
    "these more complicated but still tractable effective interactions could then be diagonalized in the shell - model - inspired effective theories to produce accurate binding energies and wave functions .",
    "there are a couple of arguments that such a scheme might converge .",
    "one is the success of the shell model when phenomenological two - body effective interactions are used .",
    "this suggests that a good part of the excluded - space physics is two - body .",
    "another is the qualitative argument that short - range clustering is increasingly unlikely as the size of the nucleon cluster increases : such spacial clustering is necessary for strong , multi - particle , high - momentum interactions .",
    "finally , we know that the pauli principle forbids short - range s - wave interactions above a=4 .    additional support for this notion comes from recent large - basis _ ab initio _ no - core shell - model ( ncsm ) calculations@xcite .",
    "these calculations use a large but finite ho hilbert space .",
    "a lee - suzuki ( ls ) similarity transformation@xcite coupled with a folded - diagram sum@xcite is performed on the bare nn interaction to yield an energy - independent effective interaction .",
    "early calculations utilized only the effective two - body interaction as derived from these transformations . hence calculations in large hilbert spaces , or included spaces , were usually needed to ensure convergence which , if judiciously chosen , could improve convergence greatly . ] of the binding energy ( _ i.e. _ the included space had to be large enough such that the contributions to the binding energy from the effective three- and higher - body terms were small ) .",
    "recent calculations that now include induced three - body interactions derived from the ls procedure show significant improvement in the convergence of binding energies for the alpha particle and some @xmath8-shell nuclei@xcite .    an alternative approach to calculating the induced three - body effective interaction was developed in ref.@xcite using an excitation - energy-_dependent _ three - body interaction based on the self - consistent solution of the bloch - horowitz ( bh ) equation@xcite .",
    "this method was successfuly used to calculate the binding energy of @xmath0he . however , both of these works to date ( _ i.e. _ ls and bh procedures ) involve handling the excluded - space physics in a very large but still finite hilbert space .",
    "this approximation introduces an extra dependence to the three - body binding on the size of the excluded space .",
    "such dependence can only be removed by a true summation over all excluded high - energy modes ( i.e. excluded space of infinte size ) .",
    "though this dependence is small due to the fact that results of these previous works are quite accurate ( both groups examined the convergence of their results as a function of the size of the excluded space ) , the rate of convergence clearly depends in detail on how singular the underlying nn interaction is . here",
    "we develop a method for calculating the effective three - body interaction that introduces no such high - momentum cutoff , but instead truly integrates over all high - energy modes .",
    "the accuracy of our results is only limited by our numerical precision .",
    "thus it can be applied with equal confidence to any underlying nn reaction , regardless of that potential s description of short - range physics .",
    "this interaction is used in the simplest test cases , @xmath0he/@xmath0h , and the results are compared with those that would result from evaluating the effective interaction only at the two - body level .",
    "our treatment is based on solving the bh equation as well , which produces a state - dependent ( and thus excitation - energy - dependent ) hermitian interaction , @xmath9 where @xmath10 here the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath11 is obtained by summing the relative kinetic energy and potential energy operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 over all nucleon pairs @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the relative kinetic energy is found by subtracting the center - of - mass ( cm ) kinetic energy from the total kinetic energy obtained by summing @xmath16 over all nucleons .",
    "@xmath17 is the total mass of the a - body system , @xmath18 is the excluded space projection operator , and @xmath19 is the included - space projection operator that defines the finite , low - energy space in which a direct diagonalization will be done , once @xmath7 is obtained . as @xmath20 is the desired eigenvalue , which is not known @xmath21 @xmath22 , the equations must be solved self - consistently . in the calculations reported here , the av18 potential is used as the bare @xmath6 interaction and no bare three - body interaction is included .",
    "because our application is to @xmath0he/@xmath0h , rather than to a heavier nucleus , we will have solved the effective interaction at the a - body level .",
    "thus we are not testing the assumption of a cluster expansion here .",
    "instead , our focus is on the technique for solving the effective interaction , and its relation to the approximate two - body result . using techniques familiar from faddeev calculations , we first determine an effective two - body - like interaction , @xmath23 , from the scattering @xmath24-matrix .",
    "we find that the induced effective three - body interaction can be evaluated perturbatively by iterating on @xmath23 .",
    "for a certain range of oscillator parameters @xmath1 , convergence is achieved even for very small included spaces , including the limiting @xmath25 space .",
    "we also develop a non - perturbative method . by rearranging the terms of the original expansion for the three - body interaction ,",
    "the series can be summed exactly through numerical solution of an integral equation .",
    "this method is very accurate and efficient for any included space and any oscillator parameter .    in section  [ preliminaries ]",
    "we generalize the two - body formulation presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "section  [ sect : perturbative ] describes our perturbative treatment of the effective interaction , while section  [ sect : nonperturbative ] presents the nonperturbative solution via an integral equation .",
    "the associated discussions focus on qualitative issues , with derivations reserved for the appendices .",
    "we discuss the results and the need for a simple test of the cluster assumption ( by applying current results to @xmath26he ) in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "to guarantee that @xmath7 , like the bare @xmath11 , is translationally invariant one can work in a complete basis of three - nucleon ho slater determinants that includes all configurations with quanta @xmath27 .",
    "such a basis , in traditional independent - particle shell - model coordinates , is overcomplete , consisting of subspaces characterized by the eigenvalues of the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath28 that do not interact via @xmath7 . for @xmath294 ,",
    "it is convenient to avoid this overcompleteness by using a jacobi basis , which reduces the @xmath30-body intrinsic - hamiltonian problem to an ( @xmath30 - 1)-body problem .",
    "this is the choice we make here .",
    "the jacobi included - space ( @xmath31 ) basis corresponding to the ho shell - model basis described above is thus simple , consisting of all relative - coordinate configurations with @xmath27 .",
    "( we note that for @xmath324 , the single - particle basis is the more efficient basis for many - body calculations .",
    "however , an @xmath7 developed in a jacobi basis can be easily transformed to single - particle coordinates for use in shell - model - inspired diagonalizations . )",
    "such included spaces for the two - nucleon system are simple to construct .",
    "for example , a @xmath2=2 included space consists of spatial wave functions of the form @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , coupled to spin and isospin wave functions to maintain antisymmetry .",
    "this requires @xmath36 to be odd .",
    "the corresponding construction of fully anti - symmetrized @xmath30-body wave functions is less trivial @xcite . here",
    "we use the codes described in ref.@xcite to generate these for @xmath30=3 . in table",
    "[ tab : dimension ] dimensions of various @xmath30=3 included spaces are given as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "for the three - body system one can obtain accurate results by diagonalizing the bare @xmath11 in a jacobi basis , provided @xmath2 is made sufficiently large .",
    "this was done in ref.@xcite for the av18 potential with @xmath2=60 , resulting in a binding energy accurate to @xmath4 20 kev .",
    "the motivation for solving this problem for small @xmath2 using effective interactions is to explore techniques that might be more feasible for larger @xmath30 , where the model - space growth analogous to table  [ tab : dimension ] will be much steeper .",
    "one goal of the current work is to find techniques that might make the integration over the excluded space more tractable . in our earlier work on the two - body system@xcite we found that this integration is difficult at both long and short distances .",
    "we found it convenient in ref.@xcite to remove the long - distance difficulties , the pathologies associated with the overbinding of the ho , at the outset .",
    "as the overbinding of the ho becomes arbitrarily large as @xmath37 increases , part of the tail of the wave function remains unresolved in any finite - basis treatment though numerically the contribution of the tail becomes increasingly unimportant in direct diagonalizations as more shells are added .",
    "( this contrasts with the short - range problem , as av18 and other modern potentials are regulated at short distance by some assumed functional form .",
    "such potentials can be fully resolved in finite bases , provided @xmath2 is larger than the scale implicit in that functional form . ) in ref.@xcite the long - range behavior was handled by the following rearrangement of eq .",

    "was stated in ref.@xcite without derivation .",
    "hence we show its derivation for completeness in appendix  [ app : bhfinal ] appearing in ref.@xcite differs from the one shown in eq .",

    "( [ eqn : bhre ] ) was applied to the deuteron in ref.@xcite and led to excellent results in perturbation theory for suitably chosen oscillator parameters @xmath1 ( only few orders of @xmath49 were needed to reproduce the deuteron binding energy to within one kev ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : endshell ] shows that @xmath51 acting on the ho state @xmath45 drastically changes that state s large-@xmath37 behavior : the asymptotic behavior of @xmath52 is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 being the mass of the particle@xcite . as this is the proper fall - off ,",
    "the overconfining effects of the ho are thus repaired .",
    "the effects are important for the deuteron , which has an extended wave function because of its small binding energy .",
    "the operator @xmath51 modifies only those ho states that reside in the last shell of the included space . for all other states within the included space ,",
    "the operator is identical to unity .",
    "the `` endshell - corrected '' states thus control all of the proper asymptotic behavior .",
    "the resummation of the kinetic energy operator allows one to adjust basis wave functions to absorb much of the short - range behavior of the @xmath6 interaction into the included space , leaving a weak residual interaction that can be handled perturbatively . by adjusting the oscillator parameter @xmath1 to low values ( @xmath56 fm ) ,",
    "the residual q - space contributions to the binding energy due to @xmath57 can be evaluated to within @xmath4 one kev in third - order perturbation theory , even for very small included spaces .",
    "this is only possible because the kinetic energy has been summed to all orders independent of @xmath1 , thus guaranteeing that the choice of a small @xmath1 will not alter the wave function at large @xmath37 .",

    "the operator @xmath60 closely resembles the free particle propagator .",

    "the free particle propagator , @xmath70 , is known analytically . indeed , its form is diagonal in momentum space .",
    "the operator @xmath71 represents a matrix composed of included - space overlaps of the free particle propagator .",
    "since we work within small included spaces , inverting this matrix is not difficult .",
    "the included - space matrix elements are easy to calculate , as analytic expressions for @xmath72 for any @xmath30-body system exists .",
