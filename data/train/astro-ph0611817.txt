    "pg1553 + 113 was discovered in the palomar - green survey of uv - excess stellar objects @xcite .",
    "it is classified as a bl lac object based on its featureless spectrum @xcite and its significant optical variability @xcite .",
    "pg1553 + 113 is well studied from the radio to the x - ray regime .",
    "based on its broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , pg1553 + 113 is now classified as a high - frequency peaked bl lac @xcite , similar to most of the agns detected at very high energies ( vhe ) .",
    "the redshift of pg1553 + 113 is essentially unknown .",
    "it was initially determined to be @xmath5=@xmath6 @xcite but later this claim was withdrawn @xcite . to date no emission or absorption lines",
    "have been measured despite several observation campaigns with optical instruments .",
    "no host galaxy was resolved in _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) images of pg1553 + 113 taken during the hst survey of 110 bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "the hst results were used to set a lower limit of @xmath5@xmath70.78 @xcite for pg1553 + 113 . a more recent publication claims a lower limit on the redshift of @xmath5@xmath70.09 using the eso - vlt optical spectroscopy survey of 42 bl lacertae objects of unknown redshift @xcite . the possibility of a large redshift is of critical importance to vhe observations due to the absorption of vhe photons @xcite by pair - production on the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "this absorption , which is energy dependent and increases strongly with redshift , distorts the vhe energy spectra observed from distant objects .",
    "it is believed that vhe photons above @xmath8gev from objects at distances @xmath9 are completely absorbed .",
    "note that the most distant objects detected so far at vhe are 1es1218 + 304 ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) and 1es1101 - 232 ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , vhe @xmath12-ray emission from pg1553 + 113 was measured by h.e.s.s @xcite and by magic @xcite .",
    "both collaborations reported a soft energy spectrum with a differential photon index of @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the vhe data from the two measurements were used independently to derive an upper limit on the redshift of the source of @xmath15 .",
    "this limit is based on the assumption of a minimum possible level of the ebl and the maximum hardness of the intrinsic vhe spectrum .",
    "although the intrinsic vhe @xmath12-ray spectra of the agns are not well known , it can be assumed that the intrinsic photon index of the sources is not harder than @xmath16=1.5 @xcite . however , there are emission scenarios where the maximum possible vhe photon index is even harder ( @xmath17 , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we use the combined h.e.s.s . and magic spectrum of pg1553 + 113 to derive upper limits on its redshift , assuming the two limits on the hardness of the intrinsic photon index ( @xmath16=1.5 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "in addition , we present an alternative method to estimate an upper limit on the redshift of pg1553 + 113 assuming that there is no break in the intrinsic vhe spectrum of the source .",
    "the most likely reaction channel in the interaction of vhe @xmath12-rays with the low energy photons of the ebl is pair production @xmath18 .",
    "this reaction has its largest cross section when the center of mass energy is roughly 2 times the threshold energy of 2m@xmath19c@xmath20 . the relevant ebl wavelength range for the absorption of vhe @xmath12-rays spans from uv light ( 0.1 @xmath21 m ) to far infrared ( few 100 @xmath21 m ) .",
    "this light predominantly consists of redshifted star light of all epochs and reemission of a part of this light by dust in galaxies . the intrinsic ( de -",
    "absorbed ) vhe photon spectrum , @xmath22 , of a blazar located at redshift @xmath5 can be determined using : @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the observed spectrum and @xmath25 is the optical depth . while the cross - section of the pair production is well known the spectral energy density of the ebl is not , which makes the calculation of the optical depth uncertain .",
    "direct measurements of the ebl are difficult because of the strong foreground emission , mainly consisting of reflected sunlight and thermal emission from zodiacal dust particles .",
    "indirect upper limits on the ebl density were obtained using fluctuation analyses of the detected background radiation @xcite .",
    "recently , an upper limit on the ebl density in the range from 0.8 to 3 @xmath21 m was determined using measured vhe spectra of distant agns @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a robust lower limit on the ebl is set by galaxy counts in different wavebands @xcite .",
    "a summary of current direct and indirect measurements of ebl is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : eblmin ] .    in the present study",
    ", we want to use the lowest possible realistic level of the ebl in order to derive a minimum redshift , above which a break in the vhe spectrum of pg1553 + 113 becomes evident .",
    "several ebl models have been developed , taking into account the evolution of the ebl , which is related to star and galaxy evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "though different in approach , the models agree in their predictions within a factor of 2 . for this study , we use the lower limit model from @xcite , which is just at the level of the direct lower limits set by the galaxy counts ( see fig .  [",

    "and magic is very good . as a test , we fitted a power law @xmath28 to the observed spectra in the overlapping energy region between 150 and 600gev by fixing the slope ( observed photon index @xmath29 ) to the value measured by h.e.s.s .",

    "the fitted index @xmath16 and its error @xmath33 are combined to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 corresponding to a 95% confidence level .",
    "we note that despite the fact that for @xmath36 ( see below ) a curved power law gives a significantly better fit to the intrinsic spectrum than a simple power law , the @xmath37 value of the latter fit is still acceptable .",
    "a redshift @xmath5 is considered to be unrealistic if @xmath38 or , in case of the extreme scenario , @xmath39 .",
    "the second method is based on the indication that for larger redshifts ( @xmath40 ) the intrinsic spectrum of pg1553 + 113 exhibits a break at about 200gev with the intrinsic energy spectrum rising after the break ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1553spec ] ) .",
    "such a break in the intrinsic spectrum of pg1553 + 113 can not be excluded _ a priori_. it could attributed to a second population of @xmath12-ray emitting particles . however , in none of the measured vhe @xmath12-ray spectra of extragalactic sources such a component has been found .",
    "thus , if a spectrum shows a break , either it is the first time a second emitting component is found in a vhe @xmath12-ray spectrum or a lower redshift value @xmath5 has to be assumed .    to test the presence of a second component ( or the presence of a break ) in the vhe spectrum of pg1553 + 113 we performed a likelihood ratio test @xcite on the intrinsic spectrum .",
    "two hypotheses are tested .",
    "hypothesis a is a simple power law ( 2 free parameters ) : @xmath41 hypothesis b is a curved power law ( 3 free parameters ) : @xmath42 which corresponds to a parabolic law in a @xmath43 vs. @xmath44 representation .",
    "a parabolic shape is a natural choice to describe the transition region of a break between two spectral components . by fitting the two functional forms ( eq .  [ eq : pl2 ] and [ eq : cpl ] ) to the de - absorbed spectrum one obtains values of the likelihood functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if hypothesis a is true the likelihood ratio @xmath47 is approximately @xmath37 distributed with one degree of freedom .",
    "one defines a probability @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath37 probability density function and @xmath50 is the measured value of @xmath51 .",

    "in this study , we combined h.e.s.s .",
    "and magic data using their good agreement and used a realistic minimum density of the ebl to reconstruct the intrinsic spectrum of pg1553 + 113 .",
    "we showed that the intrinsic photon index @xmath16 becomes smaller than @xmath59 at @xmath62 , which can be considered a robust upper limit on the redshift of pg1553 + 113 . in case of the extreme emission scenario with @xmath63",
    ", we obtain an upper limit of @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , we showed that a break in the intrinsic spectrum at about 200gev becomes evident at a redshift of @xmath53 .",
    "the break can either be interpreted as an upper limit on the redshift of pg1553 + 113 or as evidence for a second emission component in the vhe spectrum of the object .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath61 implies values of the intrinsic slope indicating that the peak of the high - energy component of the sed lies below few hundred gev , as typically derived for the closest tev blazars mrk421 and mrk501 ( in low flux state ) .",
    "we note that increasing the statistics by combining the spectra of magic and h.e.s.s . resulted in a moderate improvement of the redshift upper limit .",
