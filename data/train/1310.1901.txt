    "let @xmath0 be a one - dimensional diffusion process in the sense of it and mckean @xcite living on an interval @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 is a time - homogeneous strong markov process with continuous sample paths . as usual , the notations @xmath3 and @xmath4 are used for the probability measure and the expectation operator , respectively , associated with @xmath2 when initiated from @xmath5 .",
    "the life time of @xmath2 is defined as @xmath6 and we set @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a fictitious state ",
    "the so called cemetery state . recall that a measurable function @xmath10 is called @xmath11-excessive , @xmath12 if for all @xmath13 the following two conditions hold : @xmath14 where , by convention , @xmath15 an alternative and equivalent definition is obtained by replacing ( [ excessive1 ] ) and ( [ excessive2 ] ) by @xmath16 we refer to dynkin @xcite vol .",
    "ii for results on excessive functions in general and in particular for one - dimensional diffusions . for excessive functions in the framework of the potential theory of markov processes , see blumenthal and getoor @xcite and chung and walsh @xcite .",
    "excessive functions being descendants of superharmonic functions have , hence , deep roots in the classical potential theory and constitute also fundamental concept in the theory of markov processes .",
    "our main motivation for the present study comes , however , from the theory of optimal stopping where excessive functions play a crucial role . indeed , given a continuous non - negative ( reward ) function @xmath17 the optimal stopping problem with the underlying process",
    "@xmath2 is to find a ( value ) function @xmath18 and an ( optimal ) stopping time @xmath19 such that @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the set of all stopping times with respect to the filtration @xmath22 generated by @xmath23 the fundamental result due to snell and dynkin ( see shiryayev @xcite and peskir and shiryayev @xcite for details and references ) , is that @xmath18 is the smallest @xmath11-excessive function dominating @xmath17 and an optimal stopping time is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the so called stopping region .",
    "therefore , a good knowledge of excessive functions is a key to a deeper understanding of optimal stopping .",
    "although our focus is on applications in optimal stopping we wish to point out that excessive functions can also be used , e.g. , to condition and/or to kill a process in some particular desirable way .",
    "such conditionings of the underlying process are called excessive transforms or doob s @xmath26-transforms due to doob s pioneering work @xcite .",
    "we refer also to mckean @xcite , dynkin @xcite , and meyer et al .",
    "@xcite for early seminal papers .",
    "the theory of @xmath26-transforms in a general setting is discussed in chung and walsh @xcite chapter 11 . moreover ,",
    "a fairly recent problem arising from financial mathematics is to construct for a given process @xmath2 a martingale having the same distribution as @xmath2 at a fixed time or at a random time , see , e.g. , cox et al .",
    "@xcite , hirsch et al @xcite , ekstrm et al .",
    "@xcite and noble @xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular , klimmek @xcite exploits explicitly @xmath26-transforms to find the solution of the problem for a random ( exponential ) time .",
    "these and other applications in mind  and also per se  we offer in this paper firstly a discussion on continuity and differentiablity properties of excessive functions of one - dimensional diffusions and secondly applications to optimal stopping with an example .",
    "our approach utilizes the riesz and martin representations which are valid in their strongest and most explicit forms for one - dimensional regular diffusions .    in the next section",
    "we give the riesz and martin representations with needed prerequisities and also present some examples . an immediate implication of the riesz representation is then the continuity of excessive functions , see proposition [ cont ] .",
    "the continuity is implicitly stated already in salminen @xcite . in dayanik and karatzas @xcite and in peskir and shiryayev",
    "@xcite the continuity is proved for a special class of excessive functions , that is , for value functions in optimal stopping problems .",
    "their proofs utilize the properties of the value functions and the concavity , as in dynkin and yuschkevitch @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the present approach is that it yields the result with full generality .",
    "we also shortly list - for general interest - some other basic potential theoretical and related results for one - dimensional regular diffusions .",
    "in particular , it is seen that all additive functionals are continuous .",
    "this is also pointed out in @xcite p. 28",
    "but with a slightly different explanation .    in the third section",
    "the differentiability properties of excessive functions are investigated .",
    "the riesz representation allows us to derive conditions for differentiablity with respect to any increasing continuous function @xmath27 see theorem [ exc - thm ] .",
    "this extends the result in @xcite where differentiability with respect to the scale function is studied .",
    "we also represent the jump of the derivative of an excessive function as the sum of two terms : the first one is induced by the representing measure and the second one by the speed measure .",
    "these results are then used in the fourth section to study the principle of smooth fit in optimal stopping of one - dimensional diffusions .",
    "our contribution hereby is to demonstrate  using the results in section 3  that the proof of the condition for the smooth fit with respect to the scale as presented in @xcite can be rewritten  changing mainly only the notation  to a proof of the condition for the smooth fit in the ordinary sense as given in peskir @xcite and samee @xcite , see also @xcite ( e.g. when studying the case where the scale function is not differentiable at the stopping point ) .",
    "we conclude by analyzing the smooth fit property in an optimal stopping problem where the underlying process is a sticky brownian motion .",
    "it is known , see crocce and mordecki @xcite , that if the optimal stopping point is the sticky point then the smooth fit typically fails .",
    "our results enhance the understanding of this phenomenon by giving an explicit form for the jump of the derivative of the value function in this case .",
    "we start with by introducing more notation and recalling some basic facts .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the left and the right , respectively , end point of @xmath30 which is an interval of any kind . recall that @xmath30 is the state space of @xmath2 .",
    "the notations @xmath31 and @xmath32 are used for the speed measure and the scale function , respectively",
    ". moreover , let @xmath33 denote the generalized differential operator associated with @xmath2 and @xmath34 the first hitting time of @xmath35 , that is , @xmath36 we assume that @xmath2 is regular ( cf .",

    "[ other_regu ] the above definition of regularity differs from another often used definition in which ( [ regu ] ) is assumed to hold for all @xmath39 and @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , revuz and yor @xcite p. 300 ) . according to this latter definition",
    "we could have a regular diffusion with @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 and @xmath42 absorbing .",
    "as demonstrated below in example [ absorbing ] such a diffusion has discontinuous excessive functions  the case we want to exclude .    as showed in it and mckean @xcite the laplace transform of @xmath34 can be expressed for @xmath43 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are continuous , positive , increasing and decreasing , respectively , solutions of the generalized differential equation @xmath47 imposing appropriate boundary conditions determine @xmath45 and @xmath46 uniquely up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "the wronskian @xmath48 - a constant - is defined as @xmath49 where the superscripts @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the right and left derivatives with respect to the scale function , i.e. , for @xmath52 or @xmath46 @xmath53 cf .",
    "( [ derivatives1 ] ) and ( [ derivatives2 ] ) below and recall that the scale function of a diffusion is continuous .",

    "since @xmath60 is symmetric it follows that @xmath2 is self - dual with respect to the speed measure , that is @xmath61 where @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath17 bounded borel measurable functions satisfying appropriate integrability condtions . for the concept of duality and related topics , see kunita and watanabe @xcite , blumenthal and getoor @xcite and chung and walsh @xcite .",
    "we wish to apply the riesz representation theorem , see @xcite , and remark that the assumptions for its validity as presented in @xcite chapter vi ( see also ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 p. 505 ) ) are satisfied .",
    "an important assumption is that @xmath2 has a dual process which is standard in the sense of the definition in ibid .",
