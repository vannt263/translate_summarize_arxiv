    "the history of fractional calculus ( fc ) goes back to seventeenth century , when in 1695 the derivative of order @xmath0 was described by leibnitz . since then , the new theory turned out to be very attractive to mathematicians as well as biologists , economists , engineers and physicsts .",
    "several books were written on the theories and developments of fc @xcite . in @xcite samko",
    "et al , provide a comprehensive study of the subject .",
    "various type of fractional derivatives were studied : riemann - liouville , caputo , hadamard , erdlyi - kober , grunwald - letnikov and riesz are just a few to name . in fractional calculus ,",
    "the fractional derivatives are defined via a fractional integral @xcite . according to the literature , the riemann - liouville fractional derivative ( rlfd ) ,",
    "hence riemann - liouville fractional integral have played major roles in fc @xcite .",
    "the caputo fractional derivative has also been defined via riemann - liouville fractional integral .",
    "butzer , et al .",
    ", investigate properties of hadamard fractional integral and derivative @xcite . in @xcite , they obtain the mellin transform of the hadamard integral and diffferential operators .",
    "many of those results are summarized in @xcite and @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", author introduced a new fractional integral , which generalizes the riemann - liouville and the hadamard integrals into a single form . in the present work",
    "we obtain a new fractional derivative which generalises the two derivatives in question .    in this section",
    "we give definitions and some properties of fractional integrals and fractional derivatives of various types .",
    "more detailed explanation can be found in the book by samko et al @xcite .",
    "the _ riemann - liouville fractional integrals _ ( rlfi ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 of order @xmath3 are defined by@xcite , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . here",
    "@xmath6 is the gamma function .",
    "these integrals are called the _ left - sided _ and _ right - sided _ fractional integrals . when @xmath7 the integrals ( [ eq : lrli ] ) and ( [ eq : rrli ] ) coincide with the @xmath8-fold integrals @xcite . the _ riemann - liouville fractional derivatives _ ( rlfd ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 of order @xmath11 are defined by @xcite , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , where @xmath14 . for simplicity , from this point",
    "onwards we consider only _ left - sided _ integrals and derivative .",
    "the interested reader can find more detailed information about _ right - sided _ integrals and derivatives in the references .",
    "_ erdlyi - kober type fractional integral and differential operators _ are defined by @xcite , @xmath15 for @xmath16 . when @xmath17 , the operators are called _ erdlyi - kober _ operators .",
    "when @xmath18 , they are called _ kober - erdlyi _ or _ kober operators _ @xcite .",
    "the next important type is the _ hadamard fractional integral _ introduced by j. hadamard @xcite , and given by , @xmath19 while the _ hadamard fractional derivative _ of order @xmath20 is given by , @xmath21 where @xmath22 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author introduces a generalization to the riemann - liouville and hadamard fractional integral and also provided existence results and semigroup properties . in the same reference",
    ", author introduces a generalised fractional derivative , which does not possess the inverse property . in this paper",
    ", we describe a new fractional derivative , which generalizes the riemann - liouville and hadamard fractional derivatives .",
    "notice also that this new derivative possesses the inverse property [ theorem [ th : inv ] ] .",
    "as in @xcite , consider the space @xmath23 of those complex - valued lebesgue measurable functions @xmath24 on @xmath25 $ ] for which @xmath26 , where the norm is defined by @xmath27 and for the case @xmath28",
    "@xmath29   \\quad ( c \\in \\mathbb{r}).\\ ] ] in particular , when @xmath30 the space @xmath31 coincides with the classical @xmath32-space with @xmath33 we start with the definitions introduced in @xcite with a slight modification in the notations .",
    "let @xmath34 \\ , ( -\\infty < a < b < \\infty)$ ] be a finite interval on the real axis @xmath35 .",
    "the generalized fractional integral @xmath36 of order @xmath37 of @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this integral is called the _ left - sided _ fractional integral .",
    "similarly we can define the _ right - sided _ fractional integral @xmath42 by @xmath43    for @xmath44 and @xmath41 .",
    "these are the fractional generalizations of the @xmath45 integrals of the form @xmath46 for @xmath47 , respectively .    when @xmath48 , the generalized fractional integral is called a liouville - type integral",
    ".    now consider generalized fractional derivatives given bellow ,    ( generalized fractional derivatives ) + let @xmath49 and @xmath50 the generalized fractional derivatives , corresponding to the generalized fractional integrals ( [ eq : df1 ] ) and ( [ eq : df2 ] ) , are defined , for @xmath51 , by @xmath52 and @xmath53 if the integrals exist .",
    "when @xmath48 , the generalized fractional derivative is called a liouville - type derivative .",
    "next we give existance results for generalised fractional derivatives .",
    "generalized fractional derivatives ( [ eq : gd1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gd2 ] ) exist finitely .",
    "this is clear from theorem 3.1 of @xcite and the fact that generalized fractional integrals ( [ eq : df1 ] ) and ( [ eq : df2 ] ) have @xmath8-times differentiable kernel .",
    "the following theorem gives the relations of generalized fractional derivatives to that of riemann - liouville and hadamard .",
    "for simplicity we give only the _ left - sided _ versions here .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath50 then , for @xmath40 , @xmath55    ( [ eq : th5 ] ) and ( [ eq : th3 ] ) follow from direct substitution , while ( [ eq : th2 ] ) and ( [ eq : th4 ] ) follow from lhospital rule .",
    "similar results for _ right - sided _ integrals and derivatives also exist and can be proved similarly .",
    "note that the equations ( [ eq : th5 ] ) and ( [ eq : th3 ] ) are related to riemann - liouvile operators , while equaitons ( [ eq : th2 ] ) and ( [ eq : th4 ] ) are related to hadamard operators .    next is the inverse property .",
    "[ th : inv ] let @xmath56 , and @xmath57 be continuous .",
    "then , for @xmath58 , @xmath59    we prove this using fubini s theorem and dirichlet technique . from direct integration ,",
    "@xmath60 notice also the use of beta function in the proof .",
    "compositions between the operators of generalized fractional differentiation and generalized fractional integration are given by the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath61 be such that @xmath62 if @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then , for @xmath65 , @xmath66    proof is very much similar to that of theorem [ th : inv ] .",
    "notice that we use the property @xmath67 of the gamma function here , which is not used in the proof of the previous theorem .",
    "the author suggests the interested reader to refer property 2.27 in @xcite for similar properties of the hadamard fractional operator .",
    "the _ caputo generalized fractional derivative _ can be defined via the above generalised riemann - liouville fractional derivative as follows . if @xmath68 is the caputo type differential operator , then @xcite , @xmath69\\bigg)\\,(x)\\ ] ] and @xmath70\\bigg)\\,(x)\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath71 .",
    "now we consider an example to illustrate the results .",
    "we find the generalized fractional derivative ( [ eq : gd1 ] ) of the power function and investigate the behavior for different values of @xmath72 , which is the parameter used to control characteristics of the derivative . for simplicity assume @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we find the generalized derivative of the function @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : gd1 ] ) yields @xmath77 to evaluate the inner integral , use the substitution @xmath78 to obtain , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the beta function .",
    "thus , we obtain , @xmath81 for @xmath82 , after using the properties of the beta function @xcite and the relation @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath84 we obtain the riemann - liouville fractional derivative of the power function given by @xcite , @xmath85    this agrees well with the standard results obtained for riemann - liouville fractional derivative derivative ( [ eq : lrld ] ) .",
    "interestingly enough , for @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 , as one would expect .    to compare the results , we plot ( [ eq : gen ] ) for several values of @xmath72 .",
    "we also consider different values of @xmath88 to see the effect on the degree of the power function .",
    "the results are summarized below in figure 1 and figure 2 .",
    "+    figure [ fig : fd-1 ] summaries the comparision results for @xmath72 and @xmath88 , while figure [ fig : fd-2 ] summaries the comparision results for different values of @xmath89 and @xmath88 .",
    "it is apparant from the figure that the effect of changing the parameters is more visible for different values of @xmath89 , which is related to the fractional effect of the derivative .    in many cases we only considered the _ left - sided _ derivatives and integrals . but",
    "the _ right - sided _ derivatives can be treated similarly .",
    "we conclude the paper with the following open problem .",
    "investigate the existance of an exact formula without using the generalized functions ( i.e. , gauss - hypergeometric , h - functions , meijer s g - functions and etc ) for the left - sided generalized fractional derivative of the power function , @xmath90 with @xmath91 , that is , evaluate the following integral , @xmath92 for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath82 .    according to figure 1 and figure 2",
    ", we notice that the characteristics of the fractional derivative is highly affected by the value of @xmath72 , thus it provides a new direction for control applications .",
    "the paper presents a new fractional differentiation , which generalizes the riemann - liouville and hadamard fractional derivatives into a single form , which when a parameter is fixed at different values , produces the above derivatives as special cases .",
    "example is given to compare results .    in a future project",
    ", we will derive formulae for the mellin , laplace and fourier transforms for the generalized fractional operators .",
    "we already know that we can deduce hadamard and riemann - liouville operators for the special cases of @xmath72 .",
    "we want to further investigate the effect on the new parameter @xmath72 .",
