    "supernova neutrino study results the interesting non - linear collective oscillation phenomena of neutrinos @xcite . in the very earlier calculations incorporating the refractive index of the neutrino - neutrino forward scattering ,",
    "the off diagonal refractive indices representing the flavor transitions of neutrinos had been left out .",
    "it was , later , rectified by pantaleone@xcite .",
    "the core - collapse supernova shows that neutrinos can also have a nontrivial background to themselves when their density is extremely high . in a sn",
    "envelop msw effect comes into effect when @xmath0 is close to @xmath1 . for a few seconds after burst , i.e. , when @xmath2 @xmath3 ( large radii ) the @xmath0 is close to @xmath1 , but when @xmath4 @xmath3 then @xmath5 .",
    "that does not imply the flavor transitions get suppressed , rather at small @xmath6 neutrino and antineutrino densities are high enough to make the self - interaction effect important , which leads to the collective oscillations phenomena of neutrinos . such effect that is evident when the number density of the neutrinos is very high , especially during supernova neutrino emission ,",
    "was observed and studied by a number of researchers and scientists @xcite .",
    "although in the core collapse supernova the collective effect plays a significant role , but the role of ordinary msw effect is also important @xcite .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillation is thus a complicated multi - scale dynamical problem which involves both collective and msw effect .",
    "the existence of non - linear self interaction effect could be realized when one can see one @xcite or more @xcite splits in both @xmath7-type or @xmath8 or @xmath9-type of neutrinos in the spectrum .",
    "this is the ultimate fate of the collective oscillations scenario , although it goes through another two phases - bipolar and synchronized phase . in the numerical simulation",
    "the oscillation ranges of different self - interaction effects have been observed as follows @xcite : + @xmath10 : synchronized oscillation,@xmath11 km ) + @xmath12 : bipolar oscillation,@xmath13 km @xmath14 @xmath15 km ) + @xmath16 : spectral split,@xmath17 km ) + the analysis has been done with the mixing of two flavors , although some extensive works @xcite have already been carried out with taking all three types of neutrinos .",
    "it is well known that in the first phase of the collective oscillations all the neutrino and anti - neutrino modes oscillate with a single synchronized frequency . in the spin - precession analogy",
    "the flavor polarization vectors of all neutrino and anti - neutrino modes form one big internal magnetic field that precesses in the external magnetic field of mass basis . to begin the collective oscillations it is mandatory that such internal magnetic field is much stronger than the external magnetic field formed in the flavor space by the strong neutrino - neutrino interaction .",
    "such picture may be visualized as the motion of a spherical pendulum in the flavor space having certain frequency .",
    "when the oscillation enters into the bipolar phase the pendulum in the flavor space starts nutating . for",
    "inverted mass hierarchy a small mixing angle can make a complete conversion of neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) to the other flavor provided the case is completely symmetric in terms of lepton number .",
    "the lepton asymmetry generates a spin and as a result complete conversion is not possible . in the pendulum analogy",
    "it goes to the southern latitude but can not go completely to the south pole , particularly in the initial stage of bipolar oscillation .",
    "thus in that phase the nutation as well as precession occurs simultaneously .",
    "+ in this paper we are going to study the onset of the bipolar phase from the synchronized phase .",
    "in other words we would like to study how the onset point depends on different parameters .",
    "we are strongly motivated by a partial study of this problem by hannested et al .",
    "@xcite and duan et al . @xcite .",
    "the picture can be realized as the motion of a spinning top .",
    "if one can study such motion it is observed that initially top executes a pure precession and at certain point it starts to nutate upto a southern latitude .",
    "we are at the point of study of such onset .",
    "it is to be noted that in our entire literature we have used the notation @xmath18 as the twice the vacuum mixing angle . in the section-2",
    "we have taken the equation of motion of the collective oscillation phenomenon and shown numerically how the onset is attained with the changing self - interaction energy @xmath19 . in the next section we have considered the dynamics of spinning top and deduced the onset condition in the top language . here",
    "we have also studied analytically how the onset condition depends on the initial inclination of the top .",
    "that leads to a relation between the transition point and the vacuum mixing angle of the neutrino oscillation . in the section-4",
    "we have drawn a direct analogy between spinning top mechanism and the collective oscillation picture and translate the onset condition in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath1 . in this section",
    "we have obtained numerically the relation between onset point and the vacuum mixing angle .",
    "the values of all parameters obtained analytically are fixed by the numerical simulation .",
    "the collective oscillation phenomena starts with synchronized oscillations in which all modes of neutrinos oscillate with a single frequency .",
    "no significance conversion occurs in this phase .",
    "the conversion is significant when it enters into its bipolar phase . in the inverted hierarchy at the end of synchronized phase",
    "the nature of the oscillation suddenly becomes exponential .",
    "that is called onset , a transition point from synchronized to bipolar phase . in the study of this onset",
    "let us consider , for simplicity , a single mode of neutrino and antineutrino . in absence of matter the corresponding equations of motion of the collective oscillation",
    "are given by @xmath20 @xmath21 where , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the corresponding polarization vectors in flavor space for neutrino and antineutrino respectively .",
    "those are completely asymmetric in nature and thus their @xmath24-component can not develop identically .",
    "we have considered the inverted hierarchy and kept the vacuum frequency @xmath1 always positive .",
    "this is a simplified model of the collective oscillation , but good to study the onset condition . in the collective picture",
    "the self energy @xmath19 is not a constant but varies adiabatically .",
    "we shall discuss its adiabaticity later on .",
    "for a large @xmath19 the oscillation type is synchronized , whereas for a small @xmath19 a clear bipolar nature is observed .",
    "this can be well visualized from the figure-1 , where the evolution of @xmath25 is shown for a small @xmath19 ( = 10 ) as well as large @xmath19 ( = 200 ) .",
    "now , one can write the above equations in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath27 as follows : @xmath28 @xmath29 it is now interesting study the self interaction effect .",
    "due to very high value of @xmath19 relative to @xmath1 the polarizations vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 along with their prcessions about @xmath30 also start to precess around each other with a very small angle .",
    "the situation can be thought as both of the polarization vectors precess around the external magnetic field @xmath31 as well as around an internal magnetic field @xmath31 . as a result",
    "a peculiar non - linear effect is developed .",
    "let us consider a very small angle between @xmath31 and @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "then from equation ( 4 ) it is obtained @xmath34\\ ] ] it shows that for a small @xmath33 we can neglect the second term .",
    "it leads to the situation that the internal magnetic field precesses around the external magnetic field with the synchronized frequency @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "we would like to examine the situation in a more precise manner .",
    "+ let us construct a vector @xmath37 as @xmath38 it can easily be calculated @xmath39^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\approx(1+\\alpha)\\ ] ] for a large @xmath19 the vector @xmath37 is approximately equal to @xmath32 . now using the equation ( 3 ) one can express the internal magnetic field as @xmath40 where",
    ", @xmath41 is the unit vector along @xmath37 .",
    "clearly , the above expression is equivalent to the angular momentum .",
    "the first term in the right hand side represents the orbital angular momentum , whereas the second term stands for the spin angular momentum with @xmath42 it is now easy to express the equation of motion in terms of @xmath37 .",
    "an important point is to be noted that to construct such equation we have neglected the term @xmath43 as it is very small , but of course not zero .",
    "now the corresponding equation of motion is @xmath44 for sufficiently large @xmath19 the first term of the equation can be dropped and the resulting equation clearly shows that @xmath45 precesses round @xmath30 with synchronized frequency . if the case is symmetric , then @xmath46 and the above equation shows there will be an oscillation , called nutation . in general , there must be a combination of precession and nutation .",
    "but the question is when such bipolar motion starts .",
    "+ to study the such transition point numerically we must consider that the @xmath19 varies very slowly with time . in the numerical calculation of hannestead et al .",
    "@xcite the adiabaticity of @xmath19 is achieved by considering its expression as the function of @xmath47 . in our numerical calculation",
    "we take @xmath48 @xcite , where @xmath49 is the adiabatic parameter having the dimension of inverse time , although it can not be so small that @xmath19 remains practically a constant . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath49 becomes large then @xmath19 falls rapidly , which violates the adiabacity .",
    "therefore , it is important to fix @xmath49 properly .",
    "its extent of smallness describes how slow @xmath19 decreases . in our numerical calculations",
    "we have considered @xmath50 .",
    "now , in the figure-2 the evolution of @xmath25 and @xmath51 are plotted against @xmath52 with three different vacuum mixing angles .",
    "a sharp deviation of @xmath25 from its initial value denotes the onset .",
    "it is observed that the onset decreases with decreasing the mixing angle .",
    "that indicates the longer time is required to achieve the onset with smaller mixing angle .",
    "the figure is very much similar to that of hannestad et al .",
    "@xcite . and @xmath51 .",
    "] it was remarked in this paper that the onset value of @xmath52 would decrease logarithmically with decreasing small mixing angle .",
    "we shall examine that case both analytically as well as numerically .",
    "in this section we study the dynamics of a spinning top and find under what condition it slips .",
    "if we closely looks at the top we see it precesses with certain frequency . at some point of time it slips and",
    "start nutating .",
    "the precession and nutation continues and ultimately it falls down .",
    "but we are interested about the point at which the nutation is started .",
    "the lagrangian of the top equation is given by @xcite @xmath53 where , @xmath54 is a small inclination of the axis of the top to the vertical .",
    "the top is here spinning about its axis . @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the azimuth of its rotation around vertical and spin axis respectively .",
    "@xmath57 represents the component of the moment of inertia along its spin axis , whereas @xmath58 is that along a line lying in the plane perpendicular to the spin axis , also called figure axis .",
    "the momentum conjugate to a rotation angle is the component of the total angular momentum along the axis of rotation . in that case",
    "the torque ( due to gravity ) is along the line of nodes ( the intersecting line between the horizontal plane and the plane perpendicular to the top ) .",
    "therefore , there is no torque either along the spin axis or along the vertical axis as both of them are perpendicular to the line of nodes .",
    "hence the components of the angular momentum along these two axes ( @xmath56 and @xmath55 ) must be constant in time .",
    "thus we get @xmath59 @xmath60 we are now in the situation when there is a pure precessional mode in the sense that there is no nutation , but there must be a spin around the figure axis . now using the above two equations we can get the expression of the energy in terms of @xmath54 equation as @xmath61 note that in the above expression the term @xmath62 , which is essentially a constant of motion , is absorbed .",
    "it clearly shows an expression of energy to an one - dimensional problem with effective k.e .",
    "term @xmath63 and potential term @xmath64 .",
    "now choosing @xmath65 we can obtain an expression as follows : @xmath66 where , @xmath67 the physical motion of the top can occur only when @xmath68 is positive . for",
    ", @xmath69 there will be no nutation at all .",
    "thus the nutation will start only when @xmath70 .",
    "it is now observed that the dominant term in @xmath68 is @xmath71 .",
    "this term must be positive for the large positive value of @xmath72 , whereas negative for @xmath73 , except for the case when @xmath73 itself is a root of the equation . hence abreast",
    "one root must lie in the region @xmath74 .",
    "but in the case when @xmath73 is a root of the equation all three roots may lie in @xmath75 , the region corresponding to the real angle . now in general , if all three roots are real then one lies outside of @xmath75 , whereas other two lie inside .",
    "let us consider the roots lying inside .",
    "two possibilities are there ; either they are equal or unequal .",
    "the double root implies there is no positive part of the curve inside @xmath75 which signifies the top continues spinning .",
    "let us consider the situation when the initial point @xmath76 is a root of the equation @xmath77 , where the point @xmath78 is close to 1 .",
    "accordingly all the constants @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are fine tuned .",
    "therefore , we can say the dynamics of the top depends on the initial condition .",
    "now , if @xmath78 is the double root the third one can not enter into the interval @xmath75 and the top merely continues its spin .",
    "the situation can be well explained by the figure-3 .",
    "the dark dashed line represents the situation where the root @xmath78 lying inside @xmath75 is a double root .",
    "we see that there is no positive part of the curve in @xmath75 , only it touches the @xmath72-axis at @xmath76 , which now becomes double root . the nutation will be possible only when @xmath76 will be no longer a double root and the top nutates between two roots of @xmath77 in @xmath75 .",
    "the light dashed line shows that one root comes inside the region @xmath75 ( close to -1 ) and the nutation occurs between @xmath78 and that root .",
    "we are now going to consider under which circumstances the double root conditions get violated . using the conditions @xmath77 and @xmath83 at @xmath76 one",
    "can easily obtain @xmath84 where the @xmath85 is taken at @xmath76 .",
    "the above equation will be valid only when @xmath86 .",
    "the top precesses so far this condition holds .",
    "when @xmath87 the above equation will have no real solution and @xmath78 will be no longer a double root .",
    "thus the nutation will start at @xmath88 whereas , @xmath89 the equation ( 16 ) represents the onset condition and the equation ( 17 ) gives the value of @xmath85 at the onset point .",
    "thus the onset condition is deduced .",
    "it is observed that the onset depends on the initial inclination @xmath18 .",
    "but such @xmath18 dependence has negligible effect as @xmath90 is close to 1 .",
    "the significant @xmath18 dependence of the onset value , which is observed from figure-2 , can be realized in the other way .",
    "we shall discuss it in the next chapter .",
    "we intend to draw the analogy of this collective oscillation with the spinning top picture .",
    "the motivation is to study the transition from synchronized oscillation ( pure precession mode ) to bipolar oscillation ( precession plus nutation ) . with the aid of equation ( 7 )",
    "the lagrangian of the collective oscillation can be written as @xcite @xmath91 let us now compare the various terms as follows @xcite :    @xmath92 angular momentum + @xmath93 ; @xmath94 ; @xmath95 + @xmath96 positive vertical axis;@xmath97 positive spin axis + @xmath98 gravitational energy    with this analogy it can now easily be found @xmath99 thus the onset condition deduced in the equation ( 16 ) takes the form @xmath100 for small @xmath18 .",
    "+ the same relation has also been deduced by hannested et al .",
    "@xcite , but the numerical results give a different picture .",
    "the figure-2 shows clearly that as the mixing angle decreases the onset value shifts towards the right , that means onset @xmath19 should decrease subsequently .",
    "we have calculated numerically how the onset @xmath19 depends on the mixing angle @xmath18 . in figure-4",
    "we have plotted the onset @xmath52 against @xmath18 , which shows clearly the onset @xmath19 decreases with smaller @xmath18 . in other words",
    "the onset @xmath19 depends on the smallness of the mixing angle and hannestead et al .",
    "@xcite demanded such dependence is logarithmic .",
    "but the equation ( 20 ) does not show such effect .",
    "that discrepancy between theory and the numerical result , that is also present in the paper of hannestead et al .",
    "@xcite , should be explained properly .",
    "+ let us now recall the top picture .",
    "it is observed that if the angle of inclination is made smaller the top will take longer time to reach the onset of the nutation .",
    "such observation is based on noting down the sharp descent from the initial position at which the top was in the mode of pure precession , although it is difficult to locate that onset point accurately .",
    "it is shown in the appendix that for small variation of @xmath54 the @xmath85 does not deviate much from @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , it can be said even after the onset is achieved the top starts to deviate from its inclination very slowly so that it is very difficult to locate the actual point at which the deviation begins , i.e. , the true onset point .",
    "the same difficulty arises also in the case of collective oscillation picture .",
    "let us consider @xmath102 as the value of @xmath19 for which the common onset condition , defined in the equation ( 20 ) , holds .",
    "now for the small variation @xmath54 the expression @xmath103 takes the form as follows @xmath104 taking @xmath105 in the inverted hierarchical scenario the lagrangian , given by ( 18 ) can be written as @xmath106 assuming for a small variation of @xmath54 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath54 is constrained by @xmath107 therefore such variation is very small .",
    "it can be proved ( appendix ) that for small variation of @xmath54 the precession angular frequency @xmath85 is confined to @xmath108 .",
    "since the change of @xmath19 is adiabatic therefore it does not affect the dynamics of the small variation of @xmath54 .",
    "it can be understood in the other way .",
    "the equation ( 15 ) corresponds to the double root condition .",
    "it has already been stated that when the double root condition is violated this equation will no longer have the real solution . in terms of collective oscillation",
    "the equation has the solution as follows .",
    "@xmath109 note that the negative sign of the solution is taken instead of the positive sign .",
    "the positive sign implies that initially @xmath85 has the value @xmath110 and finally it comes down to @xmath111 . but for negative sign @xmath85 starts with @xmath112 and reaches to @xmath111 in the synchronized regime .",
    "therefore , the second one is consistent with the collective oscillations scenario as initially @xmath45 has a synchronized frequency @xmath113 .",
    "+ now the significant decrease of @xmath19 could make the term in the square root bracket negative and consequently the double root condition would be violated , as a result the bipolar motion must be started immediately .",
    "therefore , @xmath85 remains at @xmath114 for the small variation of @xmath54 .",
    "now from the lagrangian given by the equation ( 22 ) we can have the linear @xmath54 equation of motion as follows .",
    "@xmath115 solving it with the initial conditions @xmath116 and @xmath117 one can obtain @xmath118 in figure-5 @xmath54 is plotted against @xmath119 at different @xmath18 s to yield a family of curves .",
    "each curve exhibits the exponential nature .",
    "the line @xmath120 cuts all the curves at different points , which signifies that in the top picture @xmath120 will be attained at different time if the initial @xmath18 are different . in the same manner to attain any other point ,",
    "say @xmath121 the time taken by the top will be different if started from different @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , to reach at any particular @xmath54 the time taken must be different for different initial @xmath18 , but the changes of such time scale will be same for all @xmath54 in the given range .",
    "it is quite obvious that @xmath19 must change its value from @xmath102 whenever the angle is changed from initial @xmath18 to a particular @xmath54 . from the equation ( 21 ) and",
    "( 26 ) it can be deduced @xmath122 introducing the dimensionless quantity @xmath123 it can be obtained @xmath124^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] in figure-6 @xmath123 is plotted against @xmath125 for two different values of @xmath54 , which yields a pair of parallel straight lines .",
    "such linear nature of a particular curve signifies that there exists logarithmic relation between @xmath18 and @xmath52 as observed numerically by hannestad et al .",
    "it is to be noted carefully that @xmath52 is evaluated at @xmath54 , not at @xmath18 . if we consider that the onset occurs at @xmath54 , not at @xmath18 then clearly the @xmath52 ( at @xmath54 ) varies with @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the nature of the curves , representing the variation of the values of @xmath52 , are same for any @xmath54 .",
    "eventually , @xmath52 is evaluated at @xmath54 instead of @xmath18 . in principle at @xmath18 , whatever it may be , the value of @xmath52 is approximately equal to @xmath126 , @xmath54 represents a pseudo onset , which is essentially not fixed .",
    "we have studied here the onset of a bipolar oscillation for a simple case of single angle approximations .",
    "it has helped us to consider the collective oscillation as a model of spinning top .",
    "the spin precession analogy of the spinning top gives an idea how onset of the bipolar motion behaves .",
    "our numerical study reveals that onset value of @xmath19 depends on the vacuum mixing angle ; a larger mixing angle causes to attain the onset much earlier .",
    "we have tried to find its reason .",
    "if we watch an exponential curve in a large scale we find that at the beginning the curve seems to be a constant .",
    "but if the curve is observed in a small scale it can be clearly verified that the initial portion , which have been observed as constant in the larger scale , would actually have the exponential nature .",
    "it is well observed , both numerically as well as analytically , that just after achieving onset the @xmath54 changes exponentially , although initially such change is not very sharp .",
    "therefore , for a while it seems that the @xmath54 does not change at all , which implies that the bipolar motion has not been started .",
    "it follows from the equation ( 28 ) that the uncertainty @xmath127 vanishes only when the onset is evaluated at the point @xmath18 .",
    "but in the numerical calculations it is hardly possible to fix the onset exactly at the true position as @xmath85 remains at @xmath114 for the small variation of @xmath54 from @xmath18 . as a result",
    "the uncertainty @xmath128 is nonvanishing and considerable .",
    "thus in the numerical calculations what @xmath52 is considered as the onset value , can not be evaluated at the true onset .",
    "it seems then that the onset value changes logarithmically with changing @xmath18 .",
    "that is not true and on contrary the true onset value of @xmath52 must be fixed for any small @xmath18 .",
    "we are at the situation to consider the variation just after the onset is attained .",
    "it is important how far such variation is allowed .",
    "essentially the variation is considered in such a way that the angle of inclination remains small in terms of @xmath129 .",
    "this is quite obvious as we concentrate at the onset and therefore its neighbourhood should not exceed the considerable limit .",
    "now we are going to prove in the small neighbourhood of the onset @xmath85 remains constant .",
    "let us now consider the lagrangian for the top . from the equations of motions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 yield @xmath130 @xmath131\\dot{\\theta}=0   \\eqno{(a2)}\\ ] ]",
    "note that the lagrangian is free from @xmath55 and @xmath56 and therefore these two can be considered as the cyclic coordinates .",
    "compairing the above two equations with the aid of equation ( 10 ) and @xmath132 @xmath133 one can find @xmath134 this is esentially a linear first order differential equation of @xmath85 and @xmath54 having the form @xmath135 whose solution is found to be @xmath136 initially , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( onset value , assuming @xmath139 ) therefore , @xmath140 and it is found @xmath141    the above equation states for every small variation of non - zero @xmath54 @xmath85 remains at @xmath101 .",
    "ofcourse this is a valid argument only for small @xmath54 .",
    "when the @xmath54 becomes considerably large the @xmath85 becomes no longer constant .",

    "<S> the transition point from synchronized oscillation to bipolar phase is studied numerically as well as analytically . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results yielding different graphs depending on different values of possible small but non - vanishing mixing angles show the onset of the bipolar phase from the synchronized phase varies as the mixing angle . </S>",
    "<S> but the analytical study in terms of a spinning top model results a unique onset condition , which is independent of the choice of mixing angle . </S>",
