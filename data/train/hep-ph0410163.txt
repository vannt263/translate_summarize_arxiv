    "explanations of this shadowing range from leading twist to all twist effects . here",
    "( see @xcite for longer discussions , model description , a more extensive comparison with experimental data and other models , and full references ) we examine the possibility of describing the small @xmath0 data on nuclear structure functions by the relation between diffraction and nuclear shadowing which comes from inelastic shadowing @xcite .",

    "the model we have presented shows some similarities to saturation ideas .",
    "shadowing is taken into account by similar diagrams .",
    "a factorization formula analogous to ( [ eq4 ] ) has been shown @xcite to hold in saturation for gluon production in proton - nucleus collisions .",
