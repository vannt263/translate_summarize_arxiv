    "it is widely believed that graphene - based devices may be of outstanding importance for future nanoelectronics .",
    "this work has been motivated by the following two experimental observations.@xcite first , it was found that the graphene conductivity is linear in the concentration of carriers ( counted from the half filling ) with a high accuracy .",
    "second , it was found that at half filling the conductivity ( per spin direction and per valley ) is close to @xmath0 and does not show any definite temperature dependence in a broad temperature range .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze what one should expect for conductivity from the theoretical point of view and whether these theoretical predictions may be compatible with experimental findings .",
    "we will see that , in view of the unconventional character of the graphene spectrum , the theoretical results depend crucially on the nature of disorder .",

    "the electrons with momentum close to these two points , and hence with low energy , are relevant in studying the physics of the system for electron concentrations not too far from the half filling .",
