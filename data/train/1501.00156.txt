    "in the spectral action approach to ( quantum ) field theory , the space of the theory is the product of an ordinary spin manifold @xmath5 with a finite noncommutative space ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "states of the system are represented by unit vectors in @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are square integrable sections of the spinor bundle @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a finite - dimensional hilbert space representing the internal degrees of freedom of a particle .",
    "the algebra containing the observables is the tensor product of smooth functions @xmath10 on @xmath5 with certain finite dimensional algebra @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , one has an `` almost commutative '' geometry described by a product of spectral triples , with dirac operator constructed from the dirac operator of @xmath5 and certain selfadjoint operator ( a hermitian matrix ) @xmath12 on @xmath9 .",
    "a deep algebraic characterization of the space of dirac spinor fields @xmath7 on a spin manifold is as the morita equivalence bimodule between @xmath13 and the algebra @xmath14 of sections of the clifford bundle of @xmath5 .",
    "it is natural to investigate if also the finite - dimensional spectral triple of the standard model @xmath15 describes a ( noncommutative ) spin manifold , and in particular if the elements of @xmath9 are in some sense `` spinors '' .",
    "this condition  which we name `` property ( m ) '' in def .",
    "[ df : propm ]  can be precisely formulated again in terms of morita equivalence involving @xmath11 and certain noncommutative analogue of @xmath14 , and is satisfied in some basic examples like e.g.  einstein - yang - mills systems .",
    "we investigate the consequence of such a requirement on the finite non - commutative geometry that should describe the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "we shall show that in order to satisfy such a condition , we are forced to introduce two additional terms in the dirac operator , and consider a non - standard grading . in order to get the correct experimental value of the higgs mass ,",
    "various modifications of the original model have been proposed : to enlarge the hilbert space thus introducing new fermions @xcite ; to turn one of the elements of the internal dirac operator into a field by hand @xcite rather than getting it as a fluctuation of the metric ; to break ( relax ) the 1st order condition @xcite , thus allowing the presence of new terms in the dirac operator ; to enlarge the algebra @xcite and use a twisted spectral triple @xcite with bounded twisted commutators . in the present paper from the morita condition and a different grading",
    "we get two extra fields ( without breaking any of the other conditions ) .",
    "we postpone to future work a discussion of the physical implications and , in particular , how the higgs mass is modified .",
    "besides the original model , which is built around the real algebra : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the division ring of quaternions , we shall also consider the complex algebra @xmath18 which has an interesting interpretation from quantum group theory .",
    "namely , it is the semisimple part @xcite of a certain quotient of @xmath19 for @xmath20 a 3rd root of unity .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the dual compact quantum group @xmath21 fits into the exact sequence @xmath22 recall that @xmath23 is a double covering of the restricted lorentz group .",
    "one might argue that trading a commutative space for an almost commutative one , the lorentz group should be replaced by a compact quantum group covering it , which takes into account the symmetries of the internal space as well .",
    "( for preliminary studies of hopf - algebra symmetries of @xmath3/@xmath24 see @xcite ; for compact quantum group symmetries see @xcite . )",
    "we show that a minimal modification in the representation allows to replace @xmath3 by @xmath24 without changing the content of the theory . in particular , at the representation level",
    "the complexification @xmath25 of @xmath26 is the minimal unitalization of the degenerate representation @xmath27 ( the representations , here denoted by the same symbol which we will omit later on , are introduced in  [ sec:3 ] ) ; adding the identity operator ( which commutes with the dirac operator ) does nt produce new fields .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in  [ sec : setup ] we review some basic ideas of noncommutative geometry @xcite , with a view to applications to gauge theory @xcite . in  [ sec:3 ] , we review the derivation of the finite spectral triple of the standard model and discuss an alternative based on the complex algebra @xmath24 (  [ sec : hzero ] ) . in  [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we describe the most general dirac operator satisfying the 1st order condition ( which is necessary for the `` property ( m ) '' in def .",
    "[ df : propm ] ) , and in  [ sec:5 ] two possible grading operators ; the dirac operator of chamseddine - connes @xcite appears in  [ sec : cc ] . in  [ sec:6 ] , we discuss the natural condition for a spectral triple to be `` spin@xmath28 '' , based on morita equivalence , and derive some necessary conditions for this to be satisfied ; we show that in order to satisfy these condition one has to introduce two additional terms in the dirac operator of chamseddine - connes , one mixing @xmath29 with @xmath30 and one mixing leptons with quarks ( for a study of lepto - quarks in this setting , one can see @xcite ) .",
    "the last term is also necessary in order to have an irreducible spectral triple , cf .  ",
