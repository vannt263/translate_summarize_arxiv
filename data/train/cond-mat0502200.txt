    "an assembly of particles interacting via hard - core repulsion serves as a useful model for studying simple fluids , colloids , liquid crystals and many other soft matter systems .",
    "the analysis of such model systems helps in understanding the features of real systems , such as their phase behaviour , structural and dynamic properties .",
    "an important role is played by the anisotropy of shape of the constituent particles , which can range from thick elongated platelets to thin rods . some examples of systems in which the constituent particles show anisotropy are certain types of colloids , liquid crystals and protein molecules .",
    "in particular , rod - like particles are found in suspensions of the tobacco mosaic virus  @xcite , nematic liquid crystals  @xcite and , recently , carbon nanotube gels  @xcite .",
    "all these systems show very rich and characteristic phase behaviour .",
    "rod - like particles have been modeled theoretically as ellipses  @xcite , rectangles and spherocylinders  @xcite with varying aspect ratios , a limiting case being infinitely thin hard rods or needles  @xcite .",
    "these systems exhibit a number of interesting entropy - driven phase transitions which have been studied in two and three dimensions , usually using simulations with number - conserving dynamics . on the other hand",
    ", there are a number of physical processes which involve adsorption ( deposition ) and desorption ( evaporation ) of particles , which do not conserve particle number and which are important for some monolayer growth processes .",
    "adsorption and desorption are also important in the binding / unbinding of ligands to microtubules , the interaction of proteins with dna  @xcite and many catalytic reactions .",
    "finally , in recent experiments on assemblies of long objects ( rice grains , thin metal rods ) on a vibrating plate  @xcite , individual particles jump off and return to the plate , leading ultimately to a state with interesting patterns .",
    "these considerations motivate us to study the deposition and evaporation of hard objects with rigid boundaries on a substrate .",
    "while a deposition - only system , of the type studied in random sequential adsorption  @xcite , can end up in a non - evolving jammed configuration , with the addition of evaporation , the system eventually reaches an equilibrium steady state with a density governed by the rates of deposition and evaporation [ 12 - 17 ] .",
    "while most of these studies have focussed on the kinetics of approach to steady state , in this paper , we are interested in the properties of the steady state itself . specifically , we study the patterns formed due to deposition and evaporation of infinitely thin hard rods ( needles ) on a 2d substrate .",
    "needles are a limiting case of rod like particles in the systems mentioned earlier .",
    "though not directly applicable to any physical system , this is an important limiting case ; the limit of zero width simplifies the problem by eliminating the aspect ratio as a parameter .",
    "the hard core constraint is enforced by rejecting any deposition event which results in an overlap of needles .",
    "it is useful to recall some known facts about a system of hard needles with no externally imposed spatial inhomogeneities .",
    "this system shows a transition from a low - density orientationally disordered ( isotropic ) state to a high - density ordered state with nematic correlations .",
    "this transition , whose existence was pointed out by onsager  @xcite , can be viewed as an outcome of the interplay between orientational and translational entropy of the needles ; the ordered ( aligned ) state is preferred at high density since alignment leads to an increase of translational entropy , albeit at the cost of orientational entropy .",
    "the nature of the orientational ordering is dimension - dependent . in three dimensions , orientational long range order ( lro )",
    "a state with lro would break the continuous symmetry of rotations , and is thus not expected to occur in 2d , even though the mermin - wagner theorem can not be generalized to this system  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the simulation study of frenkel and eppenga  @xcite on a system with a fixed number of needles confirms the absence of lro in 2d , and finds a phase with power - law decays of orientational correlations , quite analogously to the xy model  @xcite .    on a coarse - grained scale , the local orientation at location * r * and time _",
    "t _ is specified by an angle field @xmath0 .",
    "the orientational correlation functions of interest are defined as @xmath1\\rangle\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is an even integer , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the same state .",
    "quadrupolar correlations are probed by @xmath2 = 2 , whereas higher values of @xmath2 correspond to higher multipolarities . from numerical simulations , we find power law decays in both space and time : @xmath5 and @xmath6 for both @xmath7 and 4 .",
    "our results for the static correlations conform to the kosterlitz - thouless theory for the onset of correlations , while our results for the dynamics show that their decay in time is governed by the edwards - wilkinson equation .",
    "we also study spatial variations of the deposition rate , and find strong effects on the nature of the ordering .",
    "we consider several types of variations : ( i ) a sharp change across a linear interface ; ( ii ) a smooth linear gradient ; ( iii ) a random variation of rates in one direction and ( iv ) random variation of rates in the plane .",
    "we find that the qualitative effect of spatial variations is to induce alignment of needles in the direction of gradient , an effect with an entropic origin . in ( i ) , the effect dies down slowly with increasing distance from the interface , but in cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) it results in a state with overall alignment along the direction of variation of the deposition rate .",
    "the random variation in ( iv ) induces frustration and the result is then a state with glassy features such as strong initial condition dependence and slow relaxation .",
    "in our model , infinitely thin hard rods ( needles ) are added to a 2d substrate with area @xmath8 with a constant attempt rate , and simultaneously removed randomly from the substrate with a specified rate . in a deposition attempt ,",
    "the location of the centre of mass of the needle is chosen at random on the substrate , and the orientation angle is chosen at random as well .",
    "let @xmath9 be the rate of attempted depositions per unit area per unit angle interval .",
    "an attempt is successful only if the depositing needle in question would not overlap with existing needles on the substrate ; otherwise it is rejected .    during evaporation",
    ", a needle is chosen at random from those present on the substrate and then removed .",
    "if the total rate of such removals is @xmath10 we may associate a removal rate @xmath11 = @xmath12 per unit area per unit angle interval .",
    "the ratio    @xmath13    of deposition to evaporation rates is the control parameter in the problem .",
    "as we show below , @xmath14 is related to the fugacity @xmath15 = @xmath16 of an equilibrium grand canonical system .",
    "the model under consideration can be thought of as describing the adsorption and release of needle - like gas molecules on a substrate in contact with a gas reservoir with which it can exchange particles .",
    "the equilibrium state on the substrate is then described by the grand canonical ( @xmath17 ) ensemble , where @xmath18 , @xmath8 and @xmath19 are respectively the chemical potential , substrate area and temperature .",
    "define scaled coordinates @xmath20 = @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the position of the @xmath23 particle on the substrate and @xmath24 is the linear dimension of the system .",
    "the grand canonical partition function can be written  @xcite as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 = ( @xmath27@xmath28 is the thermal wavelength which results from integrating over the momentum of needles , and @xmath29 is the interaction energy for a configuration in which there are @xmath30 needles with scaled centre of mass locations @xmath31 and orientations @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding equilibrium probability density of a configuration @xmath33 is  @xcite    @xmath34    for our system of hard core needles , the interaction energy @xmath29",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 when needles overlap , while @xmath37 when there is no overlap between any needles .",
    "thus all allowed configurations with fixed @xmath30 have equal weights .",
    "deposition - evaporation dynamics involves changes of @xmath30 .",
    "the evolution from a configuration @xmath38 to a configuration @xmath39 can be described by the master equation    @xmath40}\\ ] ]    the steady state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqm ] ) , obtained by setting @xmath41 = 0 , is in fact an equilibrium state if the condition of detailed balance @xmath42    is satisfied for every pair of configurations @xmath38 and @xmath39 that can be reached from each other .",
    "now , let @xmath38 denote an @xmath30-needle configuration and let @xmath39 be the @xmath43-needle configuration obtained from @xmath38 by removing a particular needle . using eq.([eq : eqn ] ) in eq.([eq : eqd ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath44 = @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the steady state of deposition - evaporation dynamics is described by the grand canonical equilibrium state with @xmath46    where @xmath47 = @xmath48 is the areal density of needles .    in our monte carlo studies we varied the control parameter @xmath14 in the range 1 to 40 and monitored the resulting density and orientational correlations .",
    "we used an @xmath49 substrate ( with @xmath24 = 15 and 25 ) where @xmath24 is in units of needle length . for each value of @xmath14 we made multiple runs , allowing up to @xmath50 monte carlo time steps for equilibration",

    "further , the values of the critical exponents and the behaviour of the orientational cumulant are consistent with kosterlitz - thouless theory .",
    "the numerical results for the dynamical correlation functions are described by a phenomenological edwards - wilkinson equation for the non - conserved orientational field .",
    "our principal results pertain to the new behavior induced by having a position - dependent @xmath14 , and hence a space - varying density of rods .",
    "an anisotropic variation of @xmath14 ( say along the x - direction only ) results in needles aligning along the @xmath14 gradient .",
    "this was understood by first considering the effect of an interface separating regions with two values of @xmath14 .",
    "entropic considerations lead the needles to align normal to the interface , i.e. along the gradient . from another point of view , @xmath14-gradients lead to new terms in the frank - like free energy and these in turn imply orientational ordering . finally in a system with quenched disorder corresponding to spatially random @xmath14 , we found indications of orientationally frozen states with glass - like characteristics",
    ". it would be useful to have a better characterization and understanding of this glassy state .",
    "the mechanism behind gradient - induced orientational ordering is simple : spatial variations of @xmath14 induce variations in needle density ; and an average alignment of needles along the gradient is preferred as this leads to an enhanced entropy of rotational excursions around the mean . in effect , the @xmath14-gradient thus behaves like an external field acting to produce nematic order , ultimately due to the strong coupling between spatial and orientational degrees of freedom in the needle system .",
    "gradient - induced ordering effects should be present in three - dimensional systems as well . in @xmath231 , the onsager mechanism for nematic long range order would predict ordering for values of a uniform @xmath14 exceeding a critical value @xmath232 .",
    "the addition of a uniform @xmath14-gradient would be expected to lead to a nonzero value of nematic ordering for all values of @xmath14 , and to enhance its value for @xmath233 .",
    "it would be interesting to test this prediction , and have a quantitative measure of gradient - induced ordering in @xmath231 .      to incorporate the effect of spatial variation of the density , we write @xmath234 in place of the director @xmath191 in the frank free energy @xmath204 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqfk ] ) .",
    "the resulting expression @xmath200 for the free energy can be written as                                              in case ( ii ) where @xmath14 varies linearly with @xmath134 , the density gradient is non - zero only along the x - direction , and vanishes along y , so the terms involving @xmath259 do not contribute .",
    "we can then read off the density dependence induced in the elastic constants in terms of the original frank s constants as      now , comparing the third term of the expression with eq .",
