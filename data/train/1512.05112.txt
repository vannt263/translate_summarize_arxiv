    "the specific heat of a substance is defined as the amount of heat , which is needed to raise the temperature by a unit degree .",
    "the specific heat of solid - state materials usually exhibits an outstanding temperature dependence , because the overall thermal behavior comes from an interplay between several specific contributions such as lattice vibrations , electronic distributions and magnetic excitations .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the magnetic contribution to the specific heat spreads just over a certain range of temperatures in contrast to the lattice and electronic contributions , which are also relevant at higher temperatures where the lattice part usually prevails over all other contributions .",
    "although the specific heat is just a mean quantity reflecting the overall energy spectrum , under certain conditions it may bring insight into microscopic details such as degeneracy of low - lying energy levels . to illustrate the case , we will perform in the present work a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic part of the specific heat of the regular ising polyhedra in an external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic part of the specific heat ( hereafter simply called as the specific heat ) can be often approximated in a certain temperature range by the schottky theory of a two - level system @xcite .",

    "recently , it has been theoretically verified that quantum heisenberg spin clusters can also exhibit the marked schottky maxima due to a mutual competition between antiferromagnetic interactions and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the essential ingredient for observing the schottky anomaly in the specific heat of antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin clusters are abrupt magnetization jumps , which appear in a stepwise magnetization curve including one or more intermediate plateaus due to a crossing of energy levels @xcite . in our preceding work",

    "the emerging peaks of the specific heat at low enough temperatures originate from low - lying excitations between the ground and first - excited states , whereas one should generally resort to the generalized schottky theory valid for arbitrary relative degeneracy @xmath29 with respect to a miscellaneous degeneracy of most of the energy levels .",
    "the difference between energy levels is nearby critical fields proportional to a deviation of the magnetic field from its critical value : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes a respective difference between the total spin of the ground state and first - excited state .",
    "the respective difference between the total spin in the most cases equals to @xmath41 , because a crossing of the energy levels from two adjacent sectors with the total spin @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the most common ( the latter sector is obtained from the former one by inverting one spin ) . in the following , our further attention will be focused on temperature and field dependences of the specific heat .",

    "this assertion holds for the ising tetrahedron as well as the other regular ising polyhedra .",
    "it is important to note that the ground state of any ising spin cluster is always unique ( non - degenerate ) at sufficiently high magnetic fields , because all ising spins are forced to align into the same direction at high enough magnetic fields within the fully polarized state . in this regard",

    "it is worth noticing that three energy levels cross each other at the saturation field and thus , one should expect that the schottky theory will not perfectly coincide with the actual height and position of the low - temperature maximum .",

    "the actual height of low - temperature maximum is slightly greater than the height obtained from the simplified schottky theory due to a presence of thermal excitations to neglected energy levels .",
    "an illustrative example of the influence of crossing of more than two energy levels is the specific heat of the ising icosahedron in a vicinity of the first critical field @xmath44 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icosaroziel](b ) .",
    "the subtraction between the exact dependence of the specific heat and schottky theoretical prediction implies a small but non - zero deviation even at low - enough temperature due to thermal excitations to one extra energy level that were neglected [ see dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : icosaroziel](b ) ] .",
    "the ising dodecahedron , similarly as the ising octahedron , shows the schottky peaks already at very low magnetic fields due to low - temperature excitations from the ground - state energy level belonging to the set with the total spin @xmath81 to the first - excited energy level from the set with the total spin @xmath82 .",

    "the ising dodecahedron differs from all the other ising polyhedra by the fact that the preferred low - lying thermal excitation simultaneously flips two ising spins and hence , the respective change of the total spin equals to @xmath85 rather than the more common change @xmath86 associated with a single spin - flip thermal excitation @xcite . more specifically , the five - fold degenerate ground state of the ising dodecahedron with the total spin @xmath87 corresponds to eight isolated spins flipped in opposite to the magnetic field , while the lowest excited state with the total spin @xmath88 consists of four isolated spins and three spin pairs all flipped in opposite to the magnetic field ( see the induced subgraphs @xmath89 and @xmath90 shown in fig .  2 of ref .",

    "fig : dodeca](b ) ] . to be more precise , nine energy levels of the ising dodecahedron cross each other at the saturation field and thus , one can not use the simplified schottky theory of two - level systems as useful approximation in order to determine the height and position of the low - temperature peaks . the field dependence of the specific heat of the ising dodecahedron is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dodeca](c ) , which provides independent confirmation of low - lying thermal excitations in a vicinity of zero field .",
    "in addition , temperature excitations between energy levels already occur at zero magnetic field as signifies non - zero specific heat at moderate temperatures @xmath91 in a zero - field limit .    to summarize",
    ", it has been evidenced that the absolute degeneracy of ground and first - excited states can be determined from the low - temperature maxima of the specific heat of the ising tetrahedron , while the low - temperature maxima of the other four regular ising polyhedra ( octahedron , cube , icosahedron , dodecahedron ) bring insight just into a relative degeneracy at particular level - crossing fields with exception of the saturation field where the absolute degeneracy is available due to the unique character of the fully polarized state .",
    "the present work deals with the specific heat of the regular ising polyhedra with the uniform antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interaction , which may display striking temperature and field dependences in a vicinity of level - crossing fields .",
    "it has been shown that the height and position of observed low - temperature maxima depend basically on a relative degeneracy between the first - excited state and the ground state , whereas the schottky theory of a two - level system often gives a plausible description of the actual height and position of the specific - heat maxima . in agreement with the schottky theory ,",
    "the height of the low - temperature maxima increases and its position decreases with increasing the relative degeneracy between the first - excited state and the ground state .",
    "however , the schottky theory provides a correct quantitative description of the actual height of the low - temperature peaks only if two energy levels cross each other at the relevant critical field , while it underestimates their height when more than two energy levels cross each other due to neglected thermal excitations to other low - lying energy levels .",
    "the relative degeneracy between the first - excited amd ground state of the regular ising polyhedra can be therefore estimated with greater or smaller accuracy from the height and position of low - temperature peaks of the specific heat , whereas the absolute degeneracy is always available at the saturation field with regard to the unique ( non - degenerate ) character of the fully polarized state .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark , moreover , that the low - temperature schottky - type peaks emerging in the specific heat of the ising octahedron and dodecahedron at low enough magnetic fields indicate an interesting refrigerant capability of these two frustrated spin structures .",
    "it has been argued previously @xcite that a giant magnetocaloric effect accompanies the adiabatic demagnetization of the ising octahedron and dodecahedron , which consequently undergo a fast cooling at sufficiently low magnetic fields .",
    "the relatively high values of the specific heat of the ising octahedron and dodecahedron @xmath62 and @xmath84 at low magnetic fields further implies a substantial capacity of magnetic materials based on the ising octahedron or dodecahedron in order absorb heat from substances that are in thermal contact with them .",
    "thus , it could be concluded that the magnetic materials being composed of a set of non - interacting ( or weakly interacting ) ising octahedrons or dodecahedrons can be regarded as promising refrigerant materials .",

    "<S> the height and position of schottky - type maximum depends essentially on a relative degeneracy of the ground state and first - excited state , which are in general quite distinct in geometrically frustrated ising spin clusters . </S>",
    "<S> low - temperature variations of the specific heat with the magnetic field exhibit multipeak structure with two peaks ( of generally different height ) symmetrically placed around each level - crossing field .    </S>",
