    "qubits are the quantum state of given physical systems .",
    "there are two kinds of qubits , the first kind is called stationary qubits which are fixed into space , the second kind is the so - called flying qubits whose position changes in time . to faithfully transfer quantum information",
    ", individual qubit control would be desirable .",
    "controlling qubits are implemented by a sequence of logical operations or quantum gates . for stationary qubits ,",
    "quantum gates are performed by choosing a proper time , however , a logic operation has to be fixed into space for flying qubits .    nowadays ,",
    "more attention has been paid on the use of the flying qubit due to the advantage that it allows one to entangle distant stationary qubits that never interacted directly @xcite . therefore , there are with keen interest in seeking new device for controlling flying qubits njcavity , fanpaper , sun1,eitqssp , lukin - np , gongzr , kimble , zglsn , zhoucavity , yanga73,flyjp18,flyel74,flyb77 .",
    "photon is the archetypal flying qubit , which is special ideal for long distance communication due to its high speed , strong stability and minor loss .",
    "therefore quantum devices that enable new filtering and switching functions have been proposed , such as single photon transistor  lukin - np , gongzr , quantum switch  @xcite .",
    "the spin of a propagating electron is an alternative leading candidate for a flying qubit  @xcite in short distance communication mostly due to the intrinsic nature of electron spin , namely that the spin degree of freedom is well isolated from the environment .",
    "the ability to manipulate an mobile spin qubits is indispensable for the potential application in quantum information processing .",
    "a singlet spin filter has been proposed by the coulomb interaction between a flying qubit and the trapped electron in a weak confining potential @xcite .",
    "later on it was generalized to a potential well with multiple bound orbitals flyb77 . in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme whereby a single propagating electron is subject to a spin - spin interaction with a magnetic impurity in a quantum wire .",
    "the local external magnetic field removes the degeneracy .",
    "then the spin - dependent scattering behavior of the propagating electron has been investigated via the tight - binding approach . due to the spin - flip interaction between a single propagating electron and the magnetic impurity , a total reflection of the propagating electron has been found by a proper choice of the injection energy of the electron , i.e. a spin filter is formed which filters the electron spin antiparallel to that of the magnetic impurity .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we introduce our system , a flying qubit in one - dimensional ( 1d ) model systems with a magnetic impurity inserted locally . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , the spin - induced multichannels is found for this 1d quantum wire . and via single - electron configurations , the quantum transport of the flying qubit has been analyzed .",
    "a spin switching mechanism is provided on the fano resonance , which is cause by the coupling between the bound state outside one energy band and the continuum in the other band .",
    "conclusions are summarized at the end of the paper .",
    "the model we considered in this paper is shown in fig .",
    "[ scatfly:1 ] .",
    "thanks to the success of nanofabrication techniques in producing extremely small quantum objects , this kind of quantum wires are now close to reality either by small semiconductor and metal structures as a fabricated quantum dot array @xcite , or by the scanning tunnel microscope  stm91,stmrev as the atomic chain .",

    "the exchange interaction among spins , which is a short range point - like interaction localized at the point @xmath7 , is described by hamiltonian @xmath19 . here",
    "we introduce the anisotropic spin - spin interaction with xxz - type .",
    "since we are interested only in the coupling to single impurity , the interaction here is written in terms of the single spin operator above , rather than the second - quantized description of the impurity . by the fourier transform , the hamiltonian for the conduction electrons reads@xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the usual creation and annihilation operators of the conduction electron with wave vectors @xmath23 and spin @xmath24 . and",

    "a flying qubit is a physical realization of a qubit which moves freely and allows information to be transported from one location to another .",
    "obivously , the spin of an electron propagating along the host 1d structure acts as a flying qubit , it also interacts and exchanges information with the magnetic impurity due to the exchange interaction . for the sake of simplicity , we assume the magnetic impurity is a spin-1/2 particle in the following discussion . the single - electron particle picture is employed to study the quantum transport in a quantum wire throughout the paper . in this section , we will first derive the eigenvalue equation , and then study the quantum transport and discuss how to manipulate the flying qubits in this system .",
    "the total spin in @xmath29 direction is always conserved during the time evolution of an arbitrary state . however , the applied magnetic field breaks the spin degeneracy .",
    "therefore , dependent on the spin - orientation of both the bloch electron and the magnetic impurity , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "obviously , the original single - band split into subbands with energy separations controlled by the local magnetic field applied to the impurity . in fig .",
    "( [ scatfly:2 ] ) , we give a sketch of the equivalent quantum wire in different subspaces . in subspace with all spins up or down ,",
    "it is a 1d chain with nearest ineraction , however in other subspace corresponding to the mixture of the singlet and triplet states , it is two 1d chains which get crossed at the point @xmath7 .",

    "note that the configurations are similar in subspace @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as well as the subspace described by hamiltonian @xmath32 when @xmath41 , so we take the scattering problem in the subspace with all spin down as an example . when the bloch electron and the impurity are widely separated , we can separate the electronic and impurity - spin degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore the eigenstate for this subspace is in the form    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the spin state of the magnetic impurity , @xmath44 is the probability density for finding the bloch electron with spin down at the @xmath45th site .",
