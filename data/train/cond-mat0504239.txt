    "<S> we report on the muon knight shift measurement in single crystals of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to what is anticipated for the heavy - fermion state based on the kondo mechanism , the presence of inhomogeneous local magnetic moments is demonstrated by the broad distribution of the knight shift at temperatures well below the presumed  kondo temperature \" ( @xmath2 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a significant fraction ( @xmath3 % ) of the specimen gives rise to a second component which is virtually non - magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> these observations strongly suggest that the anomalous properties of liv@xmath0o@xmath1  originates from frustration of local magnetic moments .    as one of the few spinel oxides which exhibit metallic conductivity , liv@xmath0o@xmath1  provides unique opportunity to study the potential relation between transport property and magnetic frustration ; the magnetic vanadium ions ( nominally v@xmath4 , 3@xmath5 ) </S>",
    "<S> form a three dimensional network of corner - shared tetrahedra ( pyrochlore sublattice ) , where antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlation between the nearest neighboring ( nn ) vanadium moments leads to a highly degenerate magnetic ground state due to geometrical frustration . </S>",
    "<S> emergence of spin glass - like ground state upon the substitution of li by zn strongly suggests that such frustration is indeed in effect@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a situation , it is predicted that an exotic ground state like resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state might occur in the system with small spins ( e.g. , @xmath6 ) where quantum fluctuation is important@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the rvb state has been proposed as a possible ground state for the high-@xmath7 cuprate superconductors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting feature is that there might be a frustration ( degeneracy ) of charge state in view of nearly localized electrons ; there are a variety of mappings for the v@xmath8 and v@xmath9 ions which are energetically equivalent on the pyrochlore lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the recent revelation of a heavy fermion - like behavior in liv@xmath0o@xmath1  has stimulated renewed interest in this compound , where the large sommerfeld coefficient at low temperatures ( @xmath10 j / mol k@xmath11 ) comparable to that of typical @xmath12-electron heavy fermion compounds , e.g , upt@xmath13 , has been attributed to the formation of @xmath14-electron heavy quasiparticles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides the sommerfeld coefficient , other bulk properties including spin susceptibility , resistivity , and the hall coefficient commonly suggest a characteristic temperature , @xmath2 k , where the formation of such a coherent fermionic state seems to set in .    </S>",
    "<S> it is established in the @xmath12-electron heavy fermion systems , particularly in those belong to the class of  dense kondo \" system , that the heavy quasiparticles are formed by the kondo coupling between conduction electrons and local @xmath12-electrons , where the local spin degree of freedom is convoluted into the effective mass of conduction electrons through the spin - singlet formation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , provided that a similar electronic state is realized in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , there would be no possibility for the geometrical frustration to play a role in the electronic property ; the ground state would be a uniform metallic state without local magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not obvious whether or not such heavy quasiparticle state is possible in transition metal oxides , because the metallic conduction is carried by @xmath14-electrons which exhibit strong local electronic correlation .    in this brief communication , we report on our recent measurement of the muon knight shift in single crystalline ( @xmath15- ) liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . in the previous study on the powder specimen , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that there are two different magnetic sectors which are largely different in their dynamical properties@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one of those exhibits a relatively large hyperfine coupling with broad distribution at lower temperatures which is fluctuating by a characteristic frequency of @xmath16@xmath17 s@xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the fractional yield of this magnetically fluctuating component is further enhanced in the single crystalline specimen , while the non - magnetic sector still remains as a minority component . </S>",
    "<S> this observation clearly demonstrates that the presence of local moments is an intrinsic property of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , and thereby it strongly suggests that the excess entropy is carried mostly by the frustrated local spins at lower temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> it is often found in the li compounds that the specimen exhibits rapid deterioration due to the migration of li atoms and subsequent oxidization at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this can be avoided by the use of large single crystal to minimize the surface area . </S>",
    "<S> however , the crystal growth of liv@xmath0o@xmath1  is quite limited due to chemical difficulties ; so far it is only the hydrothermal method that has been successful in the growth of @xmath15-liv@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the hydrothermal method does not fit for large and high - yield crystal growth in laboratory because of the difficulty to optimize conditions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has a higher possibility of li deficiency in the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we have succeeded in growing single crystals with a dimension of @xmath191 mm@xmath20 using licl - li@xmath0moo@xmath1-libo@xmath0 system as a solvent for liv@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite . the obtained crystals exhibit bulk properties which are in perfect agreement with those reported earlier@xcite . in order to avoid the deterioration due to exposure to ambient condition in transit , the crystalline specimen ( consisting of small crystals with net weight of @xmath190.1 g ) </S>",
    "<S> was encapsulated into an evacuated vial immediately after the growth .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21sr  measurements under a transverse field ( @xmath3 koe ) have been performed on the m15 beamline of triumf using the hitime spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal specimen was loaded onto a he gas - exchange type cryostat , and irradiated by a muon beam with a momentum of 29 mev / c ; the muon stopping range is @xmath22 mm at this momentum and thereby muons probe the bulk crystal properties . </S>",
    "<S> a precaution was taken to minimize the duration of exposure to the air while loading the specimen from the vial . </S>",
    "<S> a low - background decay - positron counter system was employed to reduce the positron events from muons which missed the specimen . </S>",
    "<S> the relative background yield is expected to be less than @xmath195 % in the typical condition .    </S>",
    "<S> the fast fourier transform of the @xmath21sr  time spectra at low temperatures is shown in figure [ fftspec ] , where a double peak structure is clearly observed below 10 k ; detailed examination indicates that the structure due to the satellite peak at lower frequency is visible already at 50 k. while the position and linewidth of the satellite peak ( near 135 mhz ) is mostly independent of temperature , the main peak exhibits a shift to higher frequency and associated increase of the linewidth with decreasing temperature , indicating that the latter has a much stronger hyperfine ( hf ) coupling with considerable distribution of the coupling parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these features are qualitatively in perfect agreement with those observed previously in the powder specimen@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is notable , however , that a considerable shift of the signal weight from the former to the latter component is observed in @xmath15-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the linewidth of the latter component is considerably larger than that in the powder specimen . the fitting analysis in the time domain using the form </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath23 indicates that the spectra is well reproduced by assuming three frequency components ( @xmath24 ) , where the main peak is further split into a doublet ; here @xmath25 is the muon - positron decay asymmetry , @xmath26 is the fractional yield of the component ( @xmath27 ) with a frequency @xmath28 and relaxation rate @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the initial phase .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ frqchi](a ) shows the temperature dependence of the peak frequency @xmath28 with the temperature plotted in the logarithmic scale . </S>",
    "<S> compared with that of the bulk susceptibility ( @xmath31 ) shown in figure [ frqchi](b ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( corresponding to the broad peak in figure [ fftspec ] ) exhibit steep increase over the temperature region below @xmath34 k where the susceptibility levels off . here </S>",
    "<S> , we stress that the temperature dependence of the bulk @xmath31 is in excellent agreement with that reported previously for single crystal specimen@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath35 indicates that the local susceptibility probed by the muon knight shift is not proportional to the bulk susceptibility below @xmath36 . in accordance with the muon knight shift , the spin relaxation rate of the broad peak increases steeply with decreasing temperature ( see figure [ asyrlx](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is known from the previous @xmath21sr  experiment under a longitudinal magnetic field that the longitudinal spin relaxation is slow over the relevant temperature region due to the fast fluctuation of hf fields@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the broad linewidth under a transverse field can be attributed to the distribution of hf parameters , which is naturally expected for the case of staggered magnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the behavior of frequency shift which is markedly different above and below @xmath36 , the temperature dependence of partial asymmetry for the broad peak ( i.e. , @xmath37 $ ] in figure [ asyrlx](b ) ) resembles that of @xmath31 ; it develops gradually below ambient temperature and levels off around @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the fractional yield of the broad peak ( @xmath38 ) at low temperatures is about 90 % , which is considerably larger than that observed in the powder specimen ( @xmath39 % ) @xcite . considering the quality of the present specimen </S>",
    "<S> , this result strongly suggests that the bulk electronic property is predominantly determined by the staggered magnetism . on the other hand , while the yield of the satellite peak ( @xmath40 ) exhibits gradual decrease with decreasing temperature , it stays near @xmath1910 % at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this is considerably larger than the background level of the experimental apparatus , and thereby we attribute this component to the signal from the specimen . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that such partitioning of @xmath21sr  signal into two components is commonly observed in zn - doped liv@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the significant difference in the relative yield of those components between powder and single crystalline specimen strongly suggests that the magnetic property of liv@xmath0o@xmath1  is sensitive to the quality of the specimen and that all the previous results based on powder specimen should be re - examined in this respect@xcite .    in order to examine the hf parameters in more detail , the muon knight shift ( @xmath41 ) </S>",
    "<S> is plotted against the bulk magnetic susceptibility in figure [ kchi ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the gradient in this @xmath42-@xmath31 plot provides the muon hf parameter , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the avogadro number and @xmath45 is the bohr magneton . </S>",
    "<S> as is anticipated from figure [ frqchi ] , the @xmath42-@xmath31 relation is highly non - linear for the broad components ( corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , while that for the satellite line ( @xmath46 ) exhibits a linear relation with small negative gradient corresponding to @xmath47 koe/@xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in good contrast to the typical behavior observed in conventional heavy fermion compounds , e.g. , ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 ( @xmath48 k)@xcite , where no such anomaly is observed . in terms of the broad component , </S>",
    "<S> the previous result obtained for the powder specimen@xcite ( dashed lines in figure [ kchi ] ) seems to be a coarse average of the behavior observed in @xmath15-liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a broad distribution of hf parameter below @xmath36 is confirmed from this non - linear behavior of the @xmath42-@xmath31 plot . in the meantime , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated value of @xmath49 shows reasonable agreement with the mean value of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 koe/@xmath45 ) at the lowest temperature when the muon site is assumed to be slightly off the center of a ring consisting of six v@xmath9 ions ( with their full moment in effect ) to form muon - oxygen bond ( @xmath51  ) ; the reason not to consider the contribution of v@xmath8 is discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> it is inferred from the large hf parameter as well as its broad distribution ( @xmath52 koe/@xmath45 ) observed for the predominant component that there are staggered magnetic moments of vanadium ions in liv@xmath0o@xmath1  at temperatures well below the presumed kondo temperature ( @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite different from what is expected for the conventional kondo lattice system where the local moments are quenched by the kondo coupling to the conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the present @xmath21sr  result is clearly inconsistent with the theoretical models which assume the disappearance of local moments due to the kondo effect or other mechanisms@xcite . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , it strongly suggests that the heavy fermion - like behavior observed in the bulk electronic property is superficial , and that it is due to the macroscopic degeneracy of the states associated with the geometrical frustration of local vanadium moments@xcite . along this line </S>",
    "<S> , a number of theoretical attempts have been made to understand the true ground state of liv@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their conjecture is based on the nearly localized v@xmath8 and v@xmath9 ions which undergo valence fluctuation ; it is interesting to note that the situation , in terms of the charge state , is similar to that considered by verwey for magnetite ( fe@xmath13o@xmath1)@xcite . then , considering the anderson s argument that the two by two occupation of v@xmath8 and v@xmath9 ions on a tetrahedron is most favorable in terms of free energy@xcite , the entire pyrochlore lattice can be viewed as a cluster of one dimensional chains / rings consisting only of v@xmath8 or v@xmath9@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such a situation is illustrated in figure [ lvosite ] . here , </S>",
    "<S> those of trivalent vanadium ions ( @xmath54 ) correspond to the haldane chains , and thus they would fall into the spin - singlet state . meanwhile , those of tetravalent vanadium ions ( @xmath6 ) would give rise to the heisenberg spin chains of local moments which would remain paramagnetic at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> it is presumable that the latter is responsible for the highly enhanced sommerfeld coefficient in liv@xmath0o@xmath1due to the entropy associated with the staggered moments@xcite , while the former is predicted to have the haldane gap and thereby would not contribute to the low energy excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the observed @xmath21sr  signals are perfectly in line with the above mentioned ground state ; the sharp satellite peak ( which is virtually non - magnetic ) might be the signal coming from the muons surrounded by the haldane chains , and the broad peaks might be from those near the heisenberg spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> the small hyperfine parameter for the former is attributed to the dipolar coupling between muons and paramagnetic spins at the edge of the haldane chains@xcite , which would exhibit normal @xmath42-@xmath31 behavior . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the linewidth for the latter would be controlled by the valence ( charge ) fluctuation rate @xmath55 ; when @xmath55 falls below @xmath16 s@xmath18 , the difference in the configuration of v@xmath8/ v@xmath9 ions around the muon sites would lead to the distribution of hyperfine parameters @xmath56 because the time - averaging mechanism becomes ineffective . here </S>",
    "<S> , we speculate that @xmath57 s@xmath18 below @xmath1910 k ( close to the charge order ) , irrespective of the spin fluctuation rate @xmath58 ( @xmath59 s@xmath18 ) that is independent of temperature as inferred from the previous lf-@xmath21sr  study@xcite . the non - linear behavior in the @xmath42-@xmath31 plot might be thus understood as a dynamical change of @xmath49 induced by the slowing down of valence fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also true , however , that liv@xmath0o@xmath1  is a metallic system and thereby the above interpretation would be an oversimplified view of the actual situation .    the non - linear behavior of @xmath42-@xmath31 relation is occasionally found in various magnetic systems including pyrochlore oxides@xcite , where the anomaly is attributed to impurities or muon - induced local perturbation of electronic states ( i.e. , muons serving as impurities ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we presume that such effect would be negligibly small in metallic liv@xmath0o@xmath1  because of the following reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the positive charge brought by muon is screened by conduction electrons in metallic systems so that the local modification of the electronic state would be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it happens that there is a large space available in the spinel structure to accommodate muons ; as mentioned earlier , muons are likely sitting near the center of large octahedron cages cornered by oxygen atoms ( see figure 5 ) . then the change in the elastic energy due to accommodation of muon would be small , although there is no quantitative estimation at this stage . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly examine the consistency of our @xmath21sr  result with those obtained by other microscopic probes . </S>",
    "<S> an apparent discrepancy seems to arise from the fact that @xmath60v/@xmath61li nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) reports only a single frequency component@xcite , whereas at least two components were observed in @xmath21sr . as discussed in the previous report@xcite , however , </S>",
    "<S> this can be readily understood by the difference in the frequency window of sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> it happens that the relaxation rate of the satellite peak ( @xmath62 ) is of the order of @xmath63 mhz , which might mask the nmr signal . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of @xmath56 and associated non - linear behavior of @xmath42-@xmath31 in the main peak might be irrelevant for nmr as long as @xmath64 s@xmath18 so that the hyperfine coupling may be averaged over the time scale of nmr . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the results from neutron scattering , the most recent report suggests the presence of two components with different dynamical characters@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it seems that the ground state of liv@xmath0o@xmath1  revealed by @xmath21sr  is consistent with the current experimental knowledge on this compound .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the ground state of liv@xmath0o@xmath1  is characterized by the staggered magnetism at low temperatures , where the presence of local magnetic moments has been established . </S>",
    "<S> while such a ground state may be explained by the valence fluctuating vanadium ions close to localization , it is inconsistent with the prediction of conventional heavy - fermion state based on the kondo scenario . in order to reconcile the metallic behavior as a bulk property with that revealed by the present @xmath21sr  study , further progress in the theoretical understanding </S>",
    "<S> is clearly needed .    </S>",
    "<S> we acknowledge comments on our first draft from d. c. johnston , and would like to thank the staff of triumf for technical support during @xmath21sr  experiment . </S>",
