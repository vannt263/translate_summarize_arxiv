    "the solar corona is a complex environment , where much of its complexity is due to magnetic fields .",
    "these magnetic fields are produced through a dynamo action near the base of the convection zone @xcite .",
    "once formed they may become buoyantly unstable , rise through the convective zone and break through the photosphere @xcite where they are observed as either sunspots in white light or active regions in magnetograms .",
    "such active regions structure the sun s atmosphere and provide energy for eruptive phenomena such as solar flares @xcite and cmes @xcite .",
    "once active regions form , small scale motions such as granular and supergranular flows result in the decay of the active region and the dispersal of magnetic flux across the solar surface in a random walk @xcite .",
    "this random walk leads to the convergence and cancellation of magnetic flux along polarity inversion lines ( pils ) , in addition to the spreading of magnetic fields . such evolution of magnetic elements in the photosphere acts as a driver for the build up of free magnetic energy in the solar corona .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the coronal field through quasi - static equilibria , in response to these motions , may be mathematically modeled through force - free magnetic fields , magnetic fields which satisfy @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", non - linear force - free field modeling has received much attention @xcite .",
    "a non - linear force - free field , is a special class of force - free field , where the scalar function @xmath5 is a function of position , but must be constant along any field line .",
    "non - linear force - free fields are of particular interest as they may contain free magnetic energy @xcite .",
    "the construction of non - linear force - free fields ( nlfff ) may be broadly split into two groups : static and time - dependent models .",
    "examples of static modeling are the  extrapolation \" of photospheric vector magnetic fields into the corona @xcite , and direct fitting of nlfff models to observed filaments and coronal structures @xcite .",
    "static modeling involves constructing either individual nlfffs or independent sequences of magnetic configurations , where there is no direct correlation or evolution between the different fields .",
    "in contrast , time - dependent quasi - static modeling evolves the coronal magnetic field through continuous sequences of related non - linear force - free fields based on the evolution of a continuous time dependent lower boundary condition .",
    "this boundary condition may be specified through either idealized magnetic field configurations @xcite or from observations @xcite . only through using dynamic models",
    "can the build up of free magnetic energy and magnetic helicity in the corona be studied , along with the evolution of isolated flux and current systems .",
    "such a technique has been successfully applied in the past to model the evolution of the global corona @xcite , determine the origin and evolution of solar filaments @xcite , study the formation and lift off of magnetic flux ropes @xcite and finally the origin of the sun s open magnetic flux @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply time dependent quasi - static non - linear force - free modeling to model the effect that the dispersal of an active region has on the overlying coronal magnetic field .",
    "a key difference between this paper and previous studies is the manner in which the time dependent lower boundary condition is applied . in previous studies either idealized magnetic field distributions or simplified surface configurations derived from observations were prescribed . in the present study , a new technique of prescribing the time dependent lower boundary condition is presented .",
    "the technique allows the use of observed line of sight component magnetograms directly as lower boundary conditions , reproducing as observed , the dispersal of the photospheric flux of the active region . from this the effect of the surface motions on the coronal magnetic field and the subsequent energy input into the corona",
    "is determined .",

    "the origin is defined to be the lower left corner of the magnetogram . throughout the four day period , as the active region crosses central meridian , the separation of the polarities is seen to slightly increase from @xmath20 km to @xmath21 km .",
    "this increase is only @xmath22 that of the initial separation .",
    "while in general , the region is diverging , there are several instances where patches of strong magnetic flux separate from the main polarities and cancel along the polarity inversion line .",
    "a key point to note is that during the evolution no systematic shear motions or vortical motions of the magnetic flux are seen .",
    "the motions of magnetic elements are mainly due to the buffeting as a result of supergranular motions .",
    "although supergranular motions provide the only obvious flow pattern , due to the large latitudinal extent of the active region differential rotation may have a small non - negligible effect .",

    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : fig3](a ) shows the total unsigned flux as derived from the individual magnetograms .",
    "the flux values are consistent with a medium sized active region .",
    "initially over the first day the flux values are seen to increase slightly , possibly due to los changes as the region rotates toward central meridian and the emergence of a small bipole on the south - western edge of the active region .",
    "however , between days 1 - 4 the flux decays away as cancellation becomes significant along the internal pil @xcite . by the end of day 4",
    "the flux has dropped by @xmath24 of its original value .",
    "this behavior fits well with the observation that it is a decaying active region .",

    "[ fig : fig3](b ) the flux difference ( flux imbalance ) calculated for each magnetogram can be seen as a function of time . over the four day period",
    "the imbalance is systematically negative , possibly due to a dominantly negative surrounding small scale fields .",

    "may be regarded to be in flux balance to a high degree of accuracy .    to use the magnetograms as a lower boundary condition in the numerical simulations complete flux balance",

    "to simulate the evolution of the coronal magnetic field above the active region a magnetofrictional relaxation technique is applied .",
    "this technique evolves the coronal magnetic field through a sequence of related non - linear force - free equilibria .",
    "the technique is similar to that described in the papers of @xcite and @xcite where the code described in these papers is adapted to a local cartesian frame of reference .",
    "previously the technique has been successfully applied to consider the coronal field based on evolving photospheric boundary conditions in either idealized setups @xcite or approximations to observed magnetograms @xcite .",
    "a key element of these simulations is that through considering a time sequence of evolved equilibria , this allows the memory of previous flux connectivities and currents to be maintained from one time to the next as energy and magnetic helicity is injected into the corona .",
    "such a feature is significantly different compared to independent extrapolations which do not maintain such memory .",
    "the magnetic field , @xmath29 , is evolved by the induction equation , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the plasma velocity and for the present study non - ideal terms are not included . to ensure that the coronal field evolves through a series of force - free states a magneto - frictional method is employed ( yang _ et al .",
    "_ , 1986 ) .",
    "we assume that the plasma velocity within the interior of the box ( representing the solar corona ) is given by , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the coefficient of friction .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lor ] ) represents in an approximate manner , the fact that in the corona the lorentz force is dominant and simulates the plasma experiencing a frictional force as it moves with respect to the reference frame .",
    "this ensures that as the coronal field is perturbed via boundary motions it evolves through a series of quasi - static non - linear force - free field distributions , satisfying @xmath35 . to carry out the computations a staggered grid",
    "is used to obtain second order accuracy for all derivatives and closed boundary conditions are applied on the side and top boundaries to match those given in section 3.2 .",
    "a key new feature within this study is that the evolution of the coronal field is driven directly through the insertion of a time sequence of observed line of sight component magnetograms .",
    "this means that the evolution of the photospheric field occurs in exactly the same way as is seen in the observations .",
    "no simplifications , idealization or smoothing is applied to the observed data and the data is inserted as observed ( with only a small correction for flux balance applied ) .",
    "the technique of specifying the sequences of the lower boundary conditions is discussed next .      to model the evolution of the active region , 61 magnetograms taken at discrete intervals of @xmath7 min are available , covering the four day period around central meridian passage . from these magnetograms a continuous time sequence of lower boundary conditions",
    "is produced .",
    "this sequence of lower boundary conditions is designed to match each observed magnetogram , pixel by pixel , every 96 minutes .",
    "however , to model the evolution of the coronal field , @xmath36 and @xmath37 the horizontal components of the vector potential * a * on the base that correspond to this magnetogram must be determined . to determine these and produce a continuous time sequence the following process is applied ,    1 .",

    "applied see @xcite .        on solving for the scalar potential",
    ", @xmath43 this determines the horizontal components of the vector potential on the base ( @xmath46 ) for each discrete time interval , @xmath7 min apart . to produce a continuous time sequence between each of the observed distributions a linear interpolation of @xmath36 and @xmath37 between each time interval @xmath40 and @xmath47",
    "is carried out . to interpolate the fields",
    "500 interpolation steps are used . by linearly interpolating the horizontal components of the vector potential on the base ,",
    "this effectively evolves the magnetic field from one state to the other .",
    "therefore techniques such as local correlation tracking are not required to determine the horizontal velocity .",
    "numerically it also means that undesirable effects such as numerical overshoot or flux pile up at cancellation sites do not occur and no additional numerical techniques to remove these problems have to be applied .",
    "the technique described above means that there are two time - scales involved in the evolution of the lower boundary condition .",
    "the first which is @xmath7 min is the time scale between observations , the second which is @xmath48s is the time - scale introduced to produce the advection of the magnetic polarities between observed states by interpolation along with the relaxation of the coronal field .",
    "the process described above reproduces the observed magnetograms at each @xmath7 min discrete time interval and therefore produces a highly accurate description of the magnetogram observations .    in movie2.mpg",
    "a comparison of the actual observations ( left ) and normal magnetic field component produced by the above technique ( right ) can be seen . a good agreement between the two",
    "the new technique means that neither feature tracking , nor local correlation tracking is required to derive horizontal velocity profiles , in order to simulate the evolution of magnetic fields between observed distributions , therefore removing a source of uncertainty . at this point",
    "it should be noted that the above technique only specifies @xmath46 on @xmath41 .",
    "it however does not specify @xmath49 which lies , @xmath50 a grid point in the box and is determined by equation  [ eq : ind ] , the coronal evolution equation .",

    "for the initial condition , a wide variety of choices may be made .",
    "these range from potential to non - linear force - free fields .",
    "one method to constrain this is to use coronal images of the active region to determine the field geometry .",
    "the most realistic form of the initial condition is the non - linear force - free field .",
    "however , since no vector magnetic field data are available to us , such a field can not be constructed .",
    "on comparing various linear force - free field solutions with coronal images we find that no single value of the force - free parameter @xmath52 fits the whole corona structure .",
    "therefore as vector magnetic field data are not available , we choose the initial condition to be a potential field , as the solution is both unique and stable . by choosing this initial condition , when analysing the evolution of the active region we restrict ourselves to studying trends in quantities , rather than absolute values . in future with sdo : hmi vector field observations this restriction of only considering trends will be removed . in section 6 the consequences of changing the initial condition from that of a potential field is discussed .    to construct a potential field",
    "the equation @xmath53 is solved in a cube with sides ranging from @xmath54 on a 256@xmath55 grid where @xmath25 unit = @xmath56 km .",
    "the cube represents an isolated region of the solar surface , where flux may only enter or leave through the lower boundary ( @xmath41 ) . as flux",
    "may only enter / leave through the lower boundary all field lines must start and end in the @xmath41 plane , and no field lines may leave through the side boundaries .",
    "this means that @xmath57 , the normal component of @xmath58 , vanishes on each of the faces except @xmath41 ( which represents the photosphere ) . to satisfy this",
    "it is assumed that the tangential components of @xmath59 are zero on each of the faces , except @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , the normal derivative of the normal component of @xmath59 is set to zero on each of these faces .",
    "if equation ( [ eq : vectff ] ) is solved subject to the above boundary conditions it is straight forward to show that the solution will have @xmath60 everywhere within the domain ( finn _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) .",
    "thus the initial condition is a potential field associated with the imposed normal field on the boundary with the choice of the coulomb gauge ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the initial potential field is constructed from the first observed magnetogram at 19.12.05 ut on 16@xmath6 december 1996 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] an illustration of the field lines of the potential field used as the initial condition can be seen . from these field lines",
    "it is clear that the decaying active region has a simple bipolar form .",
    "the field lines connecting between the positive flux ( solid contours ) and negative flux ( dashed contours ) form semi - circular loops .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig10](a ) the illustration shows the field lines for the non - linear force - free field after 4 days of evolution .",
    "this figure can be compared to figure  [ fig : fig10](b ) where the corresponding field lines for a potential field , deduced from the same normal field component on the base are plotted . in each case",
    "the starting point for the field lines is taken on the base within the positive flux region .",
    "on comparing the two images it is clear that there are many differences in the connectivity and structure of the field .",
    "the main differences occur low down along the pil between the two main polarities . here",
    "the field lines of the non - potential field have a much more sheared structure as a result of energy and helicity being injected along the field lines by the small scale convective motions .",
    "another major difference is that for the field lines lying at the southern end , the connectivity of the field is very different from that of the potential field .",
    "this is because the connectivity within the non - linear force - free simulation is initially defined at the start of the simulation and is preserved throughout the simulation ( except where numerical diffusion becomes large ) .",
    "the largest field lines within the simulation are only slightly different as the small scale convective motions have not been able to inject helicity along the full length of these field lines during the time period of the simulation .      in figure",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) the graph of total magnetic energy stored within the coronal field can be seen as a function of time .",
    "the dotted line is for the non - linear force - free field simulation , while the solid line is for a potential field deduced from the same normal field component on the lower boundary as that of the non - linear force - free field ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "both values are initially equal to one - another as the initial condition is a potential field . for both cases",
    "the total energy is of the order of @xmath62 ergs which is typical for a small active region .    initially over the first day the energy of both the non - linear force - free field and potential field increase .",
    "this increase is due to the increasing flux values , however after 1 day the magnetic energy in both peaks and then starts to decrease as the level of flux decreases due to cancellation . while both the non - linear force - free field and the potential field have a similar behaviour , it can be seen that the non - linear force - free field has a systematically higher energy compared to the potential field .",
    "this increased energy is due to the small scale convective motions which inject a poynting flux into the corona and evolve the initial coronal field away from potential .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) a graph of the total free magnetic energy within the coronal field is plotted as a function of time .",
    "the total free energy is defined as the difference between that of the non - potential and potential fields when integrated over the entire volume .",
    "this quantity is always positive and by the end of the simulation the free magnetic energy is approximately @xmath63 ergs which is @xmath26 that of the potential field .",
    "an interesting feature is that throughout the simulation the free magnetic energy as a result of the convective motions increases steadily .",
    "the rate of increase is around @xmath64 ergs s@xmath1 indicating that the small scale motions deduced from the magnetograms may inject large amounts of energy into the corona .        in figure",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] the images illustrate the locations of free magnetic energy storage for days 1 - 4 .",

    "the factor @xmath68 represents the area of the column being summed over ( @xmath69 @xmath70 ) . the area factor",

    "black denotes where the non - linear force - free field has a lower energy when integrated along the line of sight ( i.e locations where there is no free energy ) .",
    "we note that while the non - linear force - free field must and does have a volume integrated energy that is greater than that of the potential field ( see figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) , there is no restriction that in any sub - volume that this must always be true .",
    "hence the negative values of the line integral quantity in equation  [ eq : energy ] are physically valid .    as the small scale convective motions advect the field between days 1 and 4 ,",
    "the locations of free magnetic energy storage expand up into the coronal volume and mainly lie in the center of the box . from these images",
    "it is clear that the main locations of free magnetic energy is low down in the corona ( below @xmath71 mm ) and between the two main flux concentrations .",
    "it is built up at this location , as here the magnetic fields are the strongest and the energy injection through poynting flux the greatest . in addition , these field lines are the shortest and occupy a smaller volume .    while the images shown in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] are useful for illustrating the general spatial locations of free magnetic energy .",

    "it can be clearly seen that the negative region is spatially correlated with the cancellation site between the positive and negative polarities .",
    "therefore it is due to the removal of photospheric and coronal flux at this location as a result of flux cancellation ( figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .      as the coronal magnetic field",
    "is subjected to the small scale random motions , these motions not only inject magnetic energy into the field but also magnetic helicity @xcite .",

    "the horizontal components of the vector potential on the base , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are identical for both the non - linear force - free and potential magnetic fields .",
    "this means that the expression for the relative helicity does not include an addition surface integral term .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] the graph shows the variation of the relative magnetic helicity as a function of time ( solid line ) . from the behaviour of the curve",
    "it can be seen that over the first day there is no definite trend of helicity injection by the surface motions .",
    "the relative helicity oscillates between positive and negative values .",
    "in contrast , between days 1 - 4 there is a definite trend of positive helicity injection , with the relative helicity showing an increasing positive value .",
    "positive helicity injection is consistent with observations that show that active regions in the southern hemisphere have a dominant positive helicity @xcite .",
    "the dash - dot line in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] is a linear best fit to the relative helicity curve between days 1 - 4 .",
    "the gradient of the line gives a helicity injection rate of @xmath89 mx@xmath90s@xmath1 .",
    "such an increase of helicity within the coronal field can only be as the result of helicity injection through the lower boundary as a result of the relative motion of the magnetic fragments @xcite as during the period of observations there is no increase in magnetic flux .",
    "however , through considering the evolution of the magnetic elements in the magnetogram , there is no clear indication as to the origin of the helicity injection , as the dominant motion acting on the active region are small scale random motions .",
    "ergs of the corresponding potential field when summed in the z - direction . ]",
    "in contrast , on comparing figure  [ fig : fig7 ] to the graphs of flux variation ( figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) and * separation * between the centers of flux elements ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) , it can be seen that the positive helicity injection may possibly be related to large - scale properties of the evolution of the active region . to begin with on day 1 the flux peaks , after which it systematically starts to decrease .",
    "this decrease is the result of first convergence and then cancellation of the polarities along the internal pil of the bipole .",
    "secondly , around the same time the * separation * of the sources increases , so there is an overall divergence of the active region polarities .",
    "either of these two processes ( convergence / divergence ) may result in the net positive helicity injection .",
    "however , within the present simulation we are unable to determine which . to compute this techniques such as local correlation tracking would have to be applied @xcite . while there is no clear indication of its origin ,",
    "a third possibility is that such a positive injection of helicity is consistent with the effect of differential rotation as will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "while the relative helicity has a positive value the amount of helicity is small .",
    "active regions containing fluxes of @xmath91mx may well contain helicity on the order of @xmath92mx@xmath90 @xcite .",
    "on studying the coronal field in more detail it is found that the random motions inject large amounts of both positive and negative helicity , but in near equal amounts over the four days of the simulation .",
    "this is what is expected from such motions , therefore resulting in a low net helicity .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] a comparison of ( a ) the normal magnetic field component on the lower boundary and ( b ) the distribution of @xmath52 on the lower boundary can be seen for the final time snapshot of the simulation .",
    "similar plots were found at other times . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig8](a ) white / black represents positive / negative flux , while in figure  [ fig : fig8](b ) red / blue denotes positive / negative values of @xmath52 .",
    "the magnetic field values are set to saturate at @xmath93 g while the @xmath52 values saturate at @xmath94 m@xmath1 .",
    "on comparing the distributions it can be seen that the spatial distribution of @xmath52 is well correlated to that of the magnetic field .",
    "the distribution of @xmath52 take two forms .",
    "first , in locations of strong field concentrations the @xmath52 distribution takes the form of large coherent patterns .",
    "secondly , it takes the form of small isolated patches of intermingled sign which lie in small flux concentrations .",
    "it is clear from comparing the two images , that within the large concentrations of flux , a single magnetic element of one polarity may contain both positive and negative values of @xmath52 .",
    "such a mixture of positive and negative values of @xmath52 , as a result of small scale convective motions , support the results that the coronal field of the ar can not be modeled by a linear force - free field as found in section 2.2 .",
    "the positive and negative @xmath52 distributions are similar to the divided distribution of current used in the idealised model of @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the comparison is that within the large flux concentrations the northern portions appear to contain more positive values of @xmath52 , while the southern portions have more negative values .",
    "in addition to the @xmath52 values that lie within the center of the simulation , values may be seen along the edge of the magnetogram area .",
    "such edge values are a pure boundary effect and should not be considered further .    for the active region",
    "considered here no vector magnetogram data are available in order to compare observed @xmath52 distributions or trends of @xmath52 in the observations with those obtained within the simulation . in future with the launch of sdo and the sdo : hmi instrument , regular vector magnetic field data will be available which can be compared to future simulations applying this technique . through this",
    "we will be able to determine how much helicity is injected due to small scale motions , and in addition how much must be injected by other effects ( e.g. torsional alfven waves ) .",
    "this provides a new tool for the quantification of such effects which may be applied directly to observations .",
    "to determine if the rate of energy build - up within the present simulation is realistic , a simple order of magnitude calculation is carried out to determine the rate of inflow of energy into the lower boundary via the poynting vector , @xmath95 . the poynting flux ( @xmath96 ) through",
    "the lower boundary is , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the electric field and @xmath99 . in order of magnitude terms this equation",
    "may be simplified to , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the typical horizontal velocity , @xmath87 a typical normal field component , @xmath102 a typical horizontal field strength and @xmath103 the area of energy input .",
    "the area of input is taken as the area of the observed magnetogram @xmath104 @xmath70 , @xmath105 the peak flow rate of a supergranular cell .",
    "the values of the average field components are then taken to be @xmath106 g and @xmath107 g , where these values are determined from the initial potential field . through this an upper estimate of the poynting flux",
    "becomes @xmath108 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "this value is around a factor of 2 greater than the value deduced within the simulations of @xmath64 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "although the order of magnitude calculation is larger by a factor of 2 this value is an over estimate as it assumes ( i ) the flow is always at the peak rate and ( 2 ) flows that are steady and systematic . in reality",
    "all elements in the magnetogram do not move at all times and in the simulations the flow is irregular . taking this into account",
    "it can be seen that the simulation produces a realistic energy input into the coronal volume .    in the second calculation",
    ", we consider how important the energy input from the small convective motions is relative to an estimate of the radiative losses for the active region .",
    "the radiative losses in an optically thin plasma at coronal temperatures is given by , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the electron number density , @xmath111 the temperature and @xmath112 the radiative loss function which is given by rosner et al ( 1978 ) as , @xmath113 the average temperature of the active region is determined to be @xmath114 through using the sxt filter ratio technique on the al.1 and almg filters .",
    "we take the volume of the coronal emitting plasma to be @xmath115@xmath116 .",
    "note that this is not the volume of the computation box but rather an upper estimate of the volume of emitting plasma in the active region .",
    "taking also an upper estimate of the electron number density to be @xmath117@xmath118 , provides an upper estimate of the coronal radiative losses as @xmath119 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "this value can be seen to be of the same order as the energy build up due to the small scale convective motions .",
    "while the two values are consistent with one - another , it should be noted that the free magnetic energy in the simulation is held within the coronal field and therefore not immediately accessible to heat the corona and account for the radiative losses .",
    "for such a process to take place an additional energy release mechanism , would have to act .",
    "possible mechanisms include nanoflares @xcite or turbulent reconnection@xcite . at this point",
    "it is unclear if such a mechanism may release the energy .",
    "also the simple calculation does not take into account the effect of thermal conduction which is an important factor in the energy balance of hot coronal loops .",
    "however , taking these limitations into account , the calculation does show that convective motions may play a key role in the energy build up of the corona .    using the rates of energy injection determined in the simulation and assuming that it remains constant over the life - time of the active region , it is possible to estimate how much free energy the active region could have on the 16th december , the start day of the present simulations , due to prior evolution as it rotated onto the disk and towards central meridian .",
    "assuming that it emerged just before disk passage the active region would have evolved for 5 days . as a result the small scale convective motions would inject a total of @xmath120ergs of free magnetic energy into the coronal field .",
    "this value is 10@xmath2 of the active region energy on the 16th december .",
    "while the energy may have been @xmath26 higher , we can not use this to constrain the initial condition without having vector magnetic field data to constrain the distribution of @xmath52 on the lower boundary .",
    "in this paper a new technique for modeling non - linear force - free fields directly from line of sight component magnetogram observations has been presented .",
    "the key new feature of this technique is that sequences of line of sight magnetograms can be directly used as lower boundary conditions to drive the evolution of coronal magnetic fields between successive force - free equilibria . as a result ,",
    "the lower boundary condition in the model closely follows the observed magnetic field evolution as given by the observed line - of - sight magnetograms over the period of observations .",
    "the technique is illustrated by applying it to mdi observations of a decaying active region , noaa ar 8005 .",
    "the active region was close to central meridian and in flux balance to a high degree .",
    "it was modeled over a 4 day period , where 61 individual soho : mdi 96 min magnetograms where available to use as lower boundary conditions . during this time the dispersal of the active region",
    "was mainly dominated by random motions due to small scale convective cells and flux cancellation along the internal polarity inversion line .    through applying the 61 magnetograms as lower boundary conditions and simulating a continuous evolution of the surface and coronal field between them , the build up of free magnetic energy into the corona was studied .",
    "it should be noted here that the initial condition for the coronal field in the simulation was taken to be a potential field . due to the availability of only line - of - sight component magnetograms",
    "this was the only unique choice .",
    "however at the time corresponding to the start of the simulation the actual coronal field of the active region need not have been potential .",
    "therefore our aim was not to reproduce the evolution of the coronal loops as seen in coronal observations , but rather to study the trends of energy input over the period of four days , where this is deduced from using observed magnetograms .",
    "when the initial coronal field is taken to be potential , the small - scale motions inject around @xmath64 ergs s@xmath1 of free magnetic energy , this energy is mainly stored in the low corona below 30 mm .",
    "however , even if the initial state on the sun was different , this would not significantly alter the trends of energy injection found within the simulation . to illustrate this we have repeated the simulation using an initial condition of a linear force - free field , with @xmath52 values of @xmath121m@xmath1 and @xmath122m@xmath1 .",
    "these values are 80@xmath2 and 88@xmath2 of the first resonant value of @xmath52",
    ". only positive values of @xmath52 are chosen as the active region lies in the southern hemisphere . with these alternative initial conditions",
    "similar results and trends are found to those shown in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the only difference is that the magnetic field has a higher initial energy .",
    "the subsequent rates of energy injection are @xmath123 ergs s@xmath1 and @xmath124 ergs s@xmath1 respectively .",
    "these values are consistent to those found when using the potential field .",
    "the slightly higher values occur due to the increased horizontal component of field in the linear - force free field leading to a higher poynting flux . for all cases",
    "the energy injection through this new technique is consistent with estimates derived from poynting flux calculations .",
    "after just 4 days of evolution the free energy is 10@xmath2 that of the potential field . such energy buildup , is sufficient to explain the radiative losses at coronal temperatures within the active region ( @xmath125 ergs s@xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore small scale convective motions play an integral part in the energy balance of the corona .    through studying the evolution of the relative magnetic helicity in the coronal field",
    ", it was found that near equal amounts of positive and negative helicity are injected into the coronal field , but with a slight preference for positive helicity injection in the later stages .",
    "this is consistent with the active region being buffeted by small scale random motions and observations that show that active regions in the southern hemisphere have a preference for positive helicity @xcite .",
    "one possible cause of this slight positive helicity injection is the effect of differential rotation . in the southern / northern hemisphere differential rotation",
    "will inject positive / negative helicity into the corona @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that helicity injection by differential rotation is composed of two terms , which for a decayed and dispersed active region are of opposite sign .",
    "the injection rate also increases with active region latitude and varies with active region tilt angle . during the short time period of our study , where the active region lies near the equator",
    ", we expect differential rotation to play only a minor role in ejecting positive helicity into the active region .",
    "the new technique presented here has wide ranging applications for modeling the evolution of photospheric magnetic fields observed on the sun and the subsequent effect these have on the coronal field over long periods of time . in future",
    "we shall use new high resolution , high cadence full disk vector magnetic field data from sdo : hmi in combination with coronal observations to constrain the initial condition . with this",
    "we may then compare the evolution of the coronal magnetic field with that seen in coronal observations .",
    "under such constraints it will become a powerful tool to study the nature and properties of coronal magnetic fields .",
