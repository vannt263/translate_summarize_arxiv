    "<S> one is ready to obtain the ratios of decay widths of an excited @xmath32-wave heavy quarkonium into the @xmath17 when the difference in phase space is neglected @xmath33 the ratios are completely different if the initial state is a @xmath4-wave heavy quarkonium . in this case , one obtains @xmath34 therefore , the ratios of the decay widths of an excited heavy quarkonium into the @xmath35 can be used to probe the spin structure of the initial state .    replacing the @xmath36 by a photon </S>",

    "<S> however , if the mixing angle can be enhanced to around @xmath40 , which is still small , or larger , the huge hqss breaking observed by the belle collaboration can be explained by the mechanism proposed here . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically , the mixing angle for the @xmath5 could be larger than @xmath41  @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> could result in a significant spin symmetry breaking if the decays of the @xmath4-wave component are enhanced by , for instance , coupled - channel effect as will be considered in the following .    </S>",

    "<S> it is thus reasonable to assume that the wave function of the @xmath5 contains a small mixture of a @xmath4-wave component , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the decay amplitude can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mixing angle , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the decay amplitudes from the the @xmath3-wave and @xmath4-wave components , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one sees from eqs .   and that the ratios of the partial widths of the @xmath3-wave and @xmath4-wave components are distinct . </S>",

    "<S> thus , if there is a mechanism to enhance the decay amplitude of the @xmath4-wave component relative to one of the @xmath3-wave component , a relatively small @xmath4-wave admixture can induce a sizable breaking of hqss . in the following , we will assume that the decay width from the @xmath3-wave component is very small , and investigate the possibility of enhancing hqss breaking due to such a mixing .    </S>",
