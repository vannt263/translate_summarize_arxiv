    "type iip supernovae are caused by an explosion related with the core collapse of massive stars .",
    "the theory of stellar evolution predicts that sn  iip progenitors reside in the mass ( @xmath2 ) range of @xmath3 @xcite ; the bounds may be in error by 20% .",
    "the ejected mass ( @xmath4 ) is lower by the neutron star and the mass lost by the stellar wind .",
    "how do sn  iip explode  the question that still remains unresolved .",
    "two major mechanism are discussed in this context : neutrino deposition @xcite and magnetorotational explosion @xcite .",
    "a third interesting scenario suggests the rotational fragmentation of the protoneutron star followed by an explosion of neutron mini - star of @xmath5 @xcite    of particular interest for the observational verification of the explosion mechanisms could be the relation between the explosion energy and progenitor mass .",
    "common sense arguments suggests that the explosion energy should increase with the star binding energy .",
    "the latter increases with the progenitor mass @xcite , so one expects in this case that the explosion energy ( i.e. , kinetic energy at infinity ) should rise with a progenitor mass .",
    "however , the analyses of the neutrino mechanism in the framework of the 2d - hydrodynamics with a simplified neutrino transfer implies that the explosion energy , on the contrary , should decrease with the rising stellar mass at least in the progenitor mass range of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent numerical experiments using one - dimensional hydrodynamics with analytical description of the neutrino luminosity predict the non - monotonic @xmath7 relation in the mass range of @xmath8 with the energy variation in the range of @xmath9 erg @xcite . as to the magnetorotational mechanism , @xcite show that the explosion energy monotonically increases with the core mass , if one admits the constant ratio of the rotational - to - gravitational energy .",
    "a phenomenological relation between the energy and mass can be infered directly from the hydrodynamic modelling of a large sample of sn  iip .",
    "this sort of the study for the eight sn  iip indicates a correlation between the energy and progenitor mass @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the explored sample comprises only progenitors with masses @xmath10 ; whether this stems from the observational selection or the mass overestimation , remains an open issue .",
    "a different conclusion is made by @xcite using estimates based on analytical relations between the observables and the supernova parameters : a sample of 14 sn  iip does not show any correlation between the explosion energy and the mass ( but see @xcite ) . at present therefore the issue , whether the energy of sn  iip depends on the progenitor mass , remains unclear from both observational and theoretical point of view .    in the present paper",
    "we study the issue of the energy - mass relation for sn  iip using model independent arguments . for the freely expanding supernova envelope",
    "the density in the central zone depends on the ejecta mass and energy as @xmath11 .",
    "this relation @xmath12 implies that the presence or absence of the correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath4 could be checked by means of the density measurement at some fixed stage .",
    "there exists a simple and efficient method for the density determination in the sn  iip enevelope at the nebular stage using [ oi ] 6300 , 6364   doublet .",
    "the red - to - blue flux ratio in the optically thin case is r / b=1/3 .",
    "however , in the inner zone of sn  iip , where most of the synthesised oxygen resides , the optical depth in the [ oi ] 6300 line may be large . in this case the doublet ratio r / b can be larger than 1/3 .",
    "this effect was observed originally in sn  1987a and was used to estimate the density and filling factor of oxygen in this supernova @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy , that the doublet ratio value can be hampered by the thomson scattering which gives rise to the red wing of [ oi ] 6300   line and thus the increase of r / b ratio at the early nebular stage ( @xmath14 d ) up to r / b@xmath15 @xcite . to determine the oxygen density therefore one should use late time nebular spectra . on the other hand , at the very late epoch",
    "the doublet ratio converges to the limit r / b=1/3 , in which case the optical depth in the 6300   line is impossible to recover .",
    "the favorable conditions for the oxygen density determination take place at age of 250400 days .",
    "surprisingly , despite the significance of the density diagnostics upon the bases of the [ oi ] 6300 , 6364   doublet was recognized long ago , until now apart from sn  1987a this method has been applied only for sn  1988a and sn  1988h @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to measure oxygen density for a sample of sn  iip with the nebular spectra of good quality using [ oi ] 6300 , 6364  . as a result",
    ", we hope to recover distribution function of oxygen density @xmath16 for this category of supernovae .",
    "the analysis of this distribution in terms of a supernova energy and mass hopefully will permit us to draw the conclusion on the energy - mass relation and to answer the question posed by the paper title .",
    "we start with the conditions in the oxygen line - emitting zone and the method of oxygen density measurement .",
    "we find then the oxygen density for a sample of sn  iip and finaly present results for the analysis of the density distribution function .",
    "the line - emitting oxygen in sn  iip undoubtedly is a product of thermonuclear helium burning in the progenitor core .",
    "prior the supernova explosion this oxygen forms the oxygen shell on top of the iron core with the @xmath17 of silicon in between @xcite .",
    "pre - sn models predict that the oxygen mass fraction in the oxygen material is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the additional constituents are si , mg , ne , and c , with si being dominant in the inner and c in the outer layers .",
    "the explosion brings about the macroscopic mixing of the oxygen material with the outer helium and hydrogen matter mediated by rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the oxygen turns out to be distributed in condensations imbedded in the helium and hydrogen material .",
    "similar oxygen condensations are seen , e.g. , in the cas a supernova remnant although with higher velocities compared to sn  iip because the cas a supernova was sn  iib @xcite lacking hydrogen envelope .",
    "the [ oi ] doublet in sn  1987a indicates that the filling factor of oxygen condensations is @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "similar estimate is obtained from the flux fluctuations in the doublet profile @xcite .",
    "the [ oi ] 6300 , 6364    forbidden lines are emitted by transitions between the upper @xmath20d@xmath21 level and two lower levels , @xmath22p@xmath21 ( ground level ) and @xmath22p@xmath23 . generally , comparable rates of radiation and collisional transititions suggest that the population of three lower levels @xmath22p@xmath24 should be close to the boltzmann one . however , given the significance of our diagnostics one needs to be sure that the assumption of the boltzmann distribution for lower levels is justified .",
    "we first consider the ionization and thermal balance .",
    "the ionization and heating of oxygen at the nebular stage is maintained by gamma - rays from the radioactive decay @xmath25co  @xmath25fe .",
    "the fraction of the deposited energy of gamma - rays spent on the heating ( @xmath26 ) is taken according to @xcite , while the energy spent on the ionization and excitation is assumed to be similar , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "the oxygen recombination coefficient is taken according to @xcite .",
    "the model parameters are the expansion velocity at the outer boundary of the oxygen line - emitting zone ( @xmath28 ) , the amount of @xmath25ni ( @xmath29 ) , and the density . here",
    "we adopt the density to be equal to the oxygen density .",
    "the @xmath25ni is assumed to be distributed in the oxygen zone .",
    "the major coolant are the oxygen emission and mgii  2800    doublet emission ; the later contributes less than 10% .",
    "note that the component of the oxygen material with the carbon being dominant among minor species , cools efficiently by co emission and does not contribute to [ oi ] doublet emission @xcite .",
    "the observed oxygen doublet emission originates primarily from the oxygen with ne , mg , and si being dominant admixtures where mgii  2800    is the strongest emission next to the oxygen doublet .",
    "our model takes into account a specific property of the central zone of sn  iip which is revealed through the failure of the model with a homogeneous mixing of @xmath25ni to reproduce the initial ( @xmath30 d ) rise of the [ oi ] flux in sn  1987a ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to account this rise one needs to admit that the @xmath25ni is separated from the oxygen clumps by the absorbing layer devoid of the oxygen @xcite",
    "the average optical depth for gamma - quanta of this absorbing layer @xmath31 we express as some fraction @xmath32 of the total optical depth of the oxygen - emitting zone @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath32 value can be found by comparing a model and observed luminosity of [ oi ] doublet .",
    "the observed luminosity of the [ oi ] doublet in case of sn  1987a on day 300 is @xmath34 erg s@xmath35 @xcite . adopting @xmath36 @xmath1 on day 300 @xcite , @xmath37 @xcite and @xmath38 km s@xmath35 @xcite we find that the observed luminosity of the [ oi ] doublet implies @xmath39 . in that case",
    "the temperature is @xmath40  k and ionization @xmath41 .",
    "below we use @xmath39 for other sn  iip as well . in the case of sn  2004et , the high luminosity sn  iip @xcite , adopting @xmath42 and @xmath43 cm s@xmath35 @xcite and the oxygen number density concentration @xmath36 @xmath1 on day 300 we find @xmath44  k and @xmath45 . in the oposite case of the low luminosity sn  1997d @xcite with the parameters",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 cm",
    "s@xmath35 one gets @xmath48  k and @xmath49 assuming @xmath36 @xmath1 on day 300 .",
    "note that the temperature and ionization fraction are not sensitive to the density value .",
    "these results for three different sn  iip show that the oxygen at the considered epoch is essentially neutral and the temperature is in the range of 3800  4300  k.    populations of oi lower levels are found by solving rate equations taking into account four relevant levels @xmath22p@xmath24 and @xmath20d@xmath21 ; transition probabilities are from aller ( 1984 ) .",
    "for the temperature range 3800  4300  k and ionization 0.01  0.05 the found population ratio @xmath50 of @xmath22p@xmath23 and @xmath22p@xmath21 levels obey boltzmann law with the accuracy of 1% .",
    "the upper @xmath20d@xmath21 level can be underpopulated by 10% compared to boltzmann ; this however does not affect the doublet r / b ratio .",
    "given small deviation of the @xmath50 ratio from the boltzmann distribution and weak sensitivity of this ratio to the temperature in the relevant range of values we adopt the boltzmann law and @xmath51  k for each case below .",
    "with levels @xmath22p@xmath52 , @xmath22p@xmath53 , and @xmath20d@xmath21 numbered 1 , 2 and 3 , the ratio of intensities ( @xmath54 ) becomes @xmath55}{\\left[1-\\exp{(-\\tau_{13})}\\right]}\\ , , \\label{eq - rtv}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the optical depth of 6300 and 6364    lines respectively .",
    "the line optical depth of the homologously expanding envelope in the sobolev approximation is determined by the local oxygen number density @xmath58 .",
    "this means that the equation ( [ eq - rtv ] ) permits us to find the doublet ratio r / b given the number density and , on the reverse , to determine the number density given the r / b ratio .",
    "the measured doublet ratio and the inferred oxygen number density for nine sn  iip are listed in table 1 along with the spectra epochs ( column 2 ) .",
    "note , the number density are recalculated for the epoch 300 d using the relation @xmath59 .",
    "the doublet components are partially overlapped in all but two supernovae ( sn  1997d and sn  2009n ) , so we use the decomposition procedure with the template line profile @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the wavelength displacement relative to the line center in units of the line width ( @xmath62 ) ; note , the line center may be not at the rest wavelength .",
    "the power index @xmath63 in most cases is close to two . in some cases the doublet lines are slightly asymmetric which is taken into account by introducing a second component .",
    "we show in fig . 1 examples of fits for sn  1987a and sn  2012a with one and two line components respectively .",
    "the doublet ratio from table 1 are plotted in fig . 2 along with the model r / b ratio for several values of number density on day 300 .",
    "the data of table 1 and fig . 2",
    "show that the densities of eight sn  iip fall into the narrow range @xmath64 @xmath1 and only one ( sn  2005cs ) has @xmath65 @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , the number density of oxygen @xmath66 @xmath1 for sn  1988a and @xmath67 @xmath1 for sn  1988h ( both type iip ) recovered by @xcite fall into the above narrow range of oxygen densities .",
    "differential ( @xmath68 ) and cummulative @xmath16 density distributions with sn  1988a and sn  1988h taken into account are shown in fig .",
    "3 . the average density value is @xmath69 @xmath1 with the the standard deviation of @xmath70 @xmath1 .",
    "the relatively small scatter of density values for the sample of sn  iip of different luminosity , energy , and ejecta mass is rather suprising result .",
    "note that the found density distribution does not depend on the distance , extinction , or other assumptions and should be considered a reliable fact .",
    "the observation that the oxygen density on day 300 for different sn  iip lie in the narrow range already indicates monotonically rising function @xmath71 . indeed , as mentioned the density in the central zone of the envelope depends on the energy and mass as @xmath72 . in the absence of any correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath4",
    "the mass variation by a factor of two and energy by a factor of ten should cause the density variation by two order , in strong disagreement with the found density distribution @xmath16 .",
    "the energy - mass relation @xmath73 that follows from above expression combined with the small variation of @xmath74 suggests that the energy should increase with the mass of the sn  iip envelope .    to make more detailed conclusions one needs to perform modelling the distribution function @xmath16 in the framework of reasonable assumptions . for our purpose the supernova density - velocity distribution",
    "can be described analytically @xmath75 where @xmath76 while @xmath77 and @xmath78 are determined by parameters @xmath13 and @xmath4 .",
    "this function reproduces essential features of the density distribution in hydrodynamic models of sn  iip , particularly , a plateau in the central zone and a power law density drop in outer layers @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xcite ; below we use @xmath81 .",
    "one has to take into account that the oxygen density exceeds the average density in the line - emitting zone .",
    "the reason is that oxygen condensations form as a result of collision of the oxygen shell accelerated by the shock with the rarefied helium and hydrogen envelopes .",
    "the deceleration of the oxygen shell is accompanied by the rayleigh - taylor instability followed by the emergence of `` fingers '' of dense oxygen material protruding into the he / h matter . according to 2d - simulation of sn  1987a",
    "explosion @xcite the density contrast of oxygen fingers relative to the ambient material is @xmath82 .",
    "a similar number can be obtained from the following arguments .",
    "the main stage of the rayleigh - taylor instability coincides with the maxumum deceleration of the oxygen shell . for this to be the case",
    "the forward shock should sweep up the mass exceeding the mass of the oxygen shell @xmath83 , where presumably @xmath84 . in case of sn",
    "1987a the filling factor of the oxygen condensation is @xmath85 @xcite , which implies that the oxygen density contrast relative to the ambient material in the mixing zone is @xmath86 , consistent with 2d simulations .",
    "this value corresponds to the contrast relative to the average density @xmath87 .",
    "another estimate of this value can be made via the comparison of the average density in the inner zone of a normal sn  iip , e.g. , sn  1999em calculated by one - dimensional hydrodynamic model and the oxygen density derived from the [ oi ] doublet profile .",
    "parameters of sn  1999em , @xmath88 and @xmath89 erg @xcite , with above analytical density distribution result in the average density in the central zone @xmath90 g @xmath1 on day 300 .",
    "at the same time , [ oi ] doublet ratio gives the oxygen density @xmath91 g @xmath1 assuming the oxygen abundance of 0.8 ( table 1 ) .",
    "this suggests the density contrast for the oxygen condensation @xmath92 . summarizing all estimates",
    "we expect the density contrast @xmath93 for the oxygen condensations in the central zone of sn  iip .",
    "we are interested in the relation between the energy and the progenitor mass @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the neutron star mass and @xmath96 is the mass lost through the wind over the stellar life .",
    "evolutionary computations by @xcite with the mass loss rate of @xcite can be approximated in the range of @xmath97 by the relation @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "we however use below @xmath100 .",
    "this choice is based on the @xmath96 value estimated for sn  2004et with the ejecta of @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the density distribution @xmath16 is modelled by monte carlo dicing of @xmath13 and @xmath2 .",
    "the initial progenitor masses presumably are distributed according to the salpeter law @xmath102 in the range @xmath103 , where for the standard case @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding energy range is @xmath106 erg according to parameters of the sn  iip sample studied by the hydrodynamic modelling @xcite ; peculiar sn  2009kf with very high explosion energy is not included in the present sample .",
    "below we also consider other options in addition to standard choice of parameters .",
    "we present here simulations of the @xmath16 distribution for seven options .",
    "parameters of first four models are given in table 2 .",
    "in the first case ( model m1 ) there is no correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath2 : for each @xmath2 the energy is homogeneously distributed in the range @xmath106 erg .",
    "the model m2 ( standard model ) suggests the power law relation @xmath107 with the power law index determined by the interval boundaries @xmath108 .",
    "we admit a scatter of energy @xmath7 for a given mass in the range @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "this scatter mimics an effect of possible variations of mass loss , rotation , chemical composition and magnetic field .",
    "we find however that result is not sensitive to the @xmath111 value .",
    "the model m3 differs from m2 by the upper boundary of mass and energy , @xmath112 , @xmath113 erg , and by the density contrast @xmath114 .",
    "the model m3 approximately corresponds to the mass distribution of progenitors according to archive images @xcite .",
    "the model m4 differs from the model m2 by higher mass of lower boundary , @xmath115 , which corresponds to the mass range of the sn  iip sample studied hydrodynamically @xcite .",
    "we considered also the model m2s in which the luminosity selection effect for the model m2 is added .",
    "the latter is realised via multiplying the salpeter mass spectrum by a factor that suppresses the contribution of low mass supernovae @xmath116 , presumably underluminous sn  iip .",
    "this factor is represented by @xmath117 $ ] , where @xmath118 and @xmath2 is solar unit .    keeping in mind the recent study of the energy - mass relation in the framework of neutrino mechanism",
    "@xcite we consider models m5 and m6 that correspond to the mass and energy parameters from this paper .",
    "specifically , models m5 and m6 take into account that in the range of @xmath8 there are two intervals , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , in which supernovae do not explode . in the range of @xmath121 the energy increases in the interval @xmath122 erg ; in the range of @xmath123 the energy is uniformly distributed in the interval of @xmath124 erg , while in the range of @xmath125 the energy is uniformly distributed in the interval of @xmath122 erg .",
    "the discribed algorithm reproduces the energy - mass relation by @xcite with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "the only difference between models m5 and m6 is the mass loss : the model m5 has the mass loss adopted by @xcite ( cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "3 ) , whereas the model m6 suggests the lost mass assumed in our other models ( e.g. model m2 ) .",
    "the adopted density contrast in models m5 and m6 is @xmath126 .",
    "the calculated oxygen density distributions are shown in fig . 4 along with the observed distribution @xmath16 .",
    "the assumption of the absence of any correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath2 ( model m1 ) apparently contradicts to observations . on the other hand ,",
    "models m2 and m3 with the power law @xmath7 relation and the density contrast @xmath114 and 3.5 , respectively , agree satisfactory with the observed density distribution .",
    "we performed simulations for models m2 and m3 with the @xmath127 value randomly distributed in the range @xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively and did not find a noticeable difference with the case of fixed contrast values .",
    "note that multiplication of the contrast value by some factor , @xmath130 , results in the shift of the model distribution function by @xmath131 along the @xmath132 axis . in both m2 and m3 models",
    "the energy depends on mass as @xmath133 erg .",
    "this suggests that the density in the central zone depends on mass as @xmath134 , i.e. , the density is larger in low mass sn  iip .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that largest density in our smaple shows sn  2005cs with the progenitor mass of @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "the model m2s with the selection effect which reduces the contribution of low mass supernovae , @xmath116 shifts the model m2 towards the lower density by 0.13 dex , i.e. , by a factor of 1.35 . if an observed distribution @xmath16 is affected by the similar selection , the original distribution can be recovered by the shift of the observed distribution towards larger density by 0.13 dex .",
    "the model m4 with mass and energy ranges of the hydrodynamical models for the sample of seven sn  iip shows wide range of oxygen densities incompartible with the observed distribution .",
    "density distributions in the models m5 and m6 based on the energy - mass dependence from @xcite differ significantly from the observed distribution especially in the range of small densities .",
    "we now compare the energy - mass relation predicted by the distribution @xmath16 and parameters of hydrodynamic modelling .",
    "the relation @xmath7 in the standard model m2 is shown on the plot @xmath136 along with parameters of hydrodynamic models @xcite .",
    "we included also our parameters of sn  2012a ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 erg ) .",
    "the progenitor mass is derived from ejecta mass @xmath4 combined with neutron star and lost mass calculated according expression given in sec .",
    "the power law dependence @xmath139 is qualitatively consistent with the best fit relation @xmath140 for the hydrodynamic parameters of sn  iip sample .",
    "yet the difference between values of @xmath13 and @xmath2 of two sorts of relations is apparent .",
    "if the difference is entirely due to the mass , then the mass values of the sn sample turns out to be shifted towards higher masses by a factor of @xmath141 .",
    "the goal of the paper was to determine the oxygen density for a sample of sn  iip using the [ oi ] doublet in nebular spectra and then to study the relation between energy and progenitor mass upon the bases of the recovered density distribution .",
    "it was found unexpectedly that the range of oxygen number density on day 300 is very narrow @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , this result does not depend on distance , extinction , or any assumptions .",
    "the modelling for the found density distribution implies that the explosion energy of sn  iip increases with the progenitor mass .",
    "this result reflects the important property of an explosion mechanism of sn  iip that should be used to constrain explosion models .",
    "it should be emphasised that we do not include into the family of sn  iip events similar to sn  1994w @xcite and sn  2009kn @xcite which mimic sn  iip by their light curves but essentially differ by their spectra .",
    "the power index of the @xmath7 relation found from the distribution @xmath16 is close to the tangent of the scattering plot of hydrodynamic parameters of sn  iip on the @xmath142 plane .",
    "the oxygen density distribution thus confirms the conclusion about the increase of the explosion energy with the mass that is indicated by parameters of the hydrodynamic models @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we find that the @xmath7 relations obtained from the hydrodynamic parameters and from the distribution @xmath16 differ by values @xmath13 or / and @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , in this respect , that the observed distribution @xmath16 is not consistent with the model in which lower boundary is @xmath143 , i.e. equals the lower limit of the sample of sn  iip studied hydrodynamically .",
    "one of the reason of this inconsistency could be that masses derived from hydrodynamic models are overestimated .",
    "independent argument in favor of this possibility stems from the fact that progenitor masses of hydrodynamic models lie in the range @xmath10 , notably larger than the lower boundary ( @xmath144 ) which theoretically are associated with sn  iip @xcite .",
    "this disparity is strengthend by the fact that lower boundary of progenitor masses ( @xmath145 ) extracted from the archival images @xcite is close to the theoretical lower boundary .",
    "the conclusion that the explosion energy of sn  iip grows with the progenitor mass can serve a good observational test of the explosion theory for this category of supernovae .",
    "the current state of the theory however does not permit us to use this test with all its power .",
    "the energy - mass relation in the framework of neutrino mechanism recovered by @xcite using one - dimensional model predicts the distribution @xmath16 strongly unlike the observed one . yet existing uncertainties of the neutrino mechanism do not rule out the monotonic increase of the explosion energy in the mass range @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is poorely known value and probably lying in the range of @xmath148 ( t. janka , private communication ) . in the mechanism of the mini - neutron star the energy release is invariant , @xmath149 erg @xcite . since the binding energy grows with the mass this mechanism predicts decrease of the explosion energy with the mass and therefore can not be universal for sn  iip .",
    "currently , only magneto - rotational explosion admits the energy increase with the mass @xcite which makes it an appropriate mechanism for the sne  iip .",
