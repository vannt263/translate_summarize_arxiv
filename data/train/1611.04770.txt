    "exciton - polaritons are interesting quasi - particles emerging from the strong coupling between an exciton and a cavity photon , inheriting a vanishingly small effective mass from the photon while preserving exciton - mediated interactions .",
    "the long spacial and temporal coherence of polaritons enables a variety of interesting physical phenomena including : bose - einstein condensation @xcite , superfluidity @xcite , and quantized vorticity@xcite .",
    "while many of these phenomena can be captured by the gross - pitaevskii equations , which are equations of motion of the coherent polariton wave - function , it is well known that incoherent excitons also play a crucial role in the modification of the temporal dynamics of polaritons .",
    "we have previously shown that when polariton branches at @xmath0 are coherently excited by a spectrally broad laser pulse , the coherent exciton polarization converts into incoherent exciton population due to both pure and excitation induced dephasing ( eid ) @xcite , this process is best described using excitonic bloch equations ( ebes)@xcite . however , since the excitonic bloch equations are written in the exciton - photon basis and not the natural basis of the system ( _ i.e. , _ polariton basis ) , they can not fully capture some of the complex dynamics arising from the distinct polariton branches . in this paper",

    "the strong broadening of the upper polariton at zero delay in the pump - probe spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp - sim_up ] ( a ) , is the evidence for the onset of dephasing . since the exciton population has a long life time ( @xmath88 ) , the lower polariton branch of the probe spectrum presents a long lived energy blue shift at positive delays .",
    "now , let us discuss the case of positive cavity detuning at 1.1 mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme_pos ] ) . as expected ,",
    "when the up branch is excited , a strong dephasing occurs in the same way as in the negative detuning ( not shown ) .",

    ", we need to include a finite eid for the lower polariton branch , @xmath89 for the numerical simulation in fig [ fig : scheme_pos ] ( b ) , we set @xmath90 .",
    "the other parameters are same as in the negative cavity detuning case . although the upper polariton population is not involved in the process , the eid of the lower polariton converts the coherent exciton fraction of the lower polariton into a long lived incoherent exciton population ( see fig .

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsfit ] , in the case of positive detuning the addition of @xmath91 is required to better match the data .",

    "these are written as , @xmath92\\psi_l - cf_{\\rm ext}. \\label{eq : linc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , eq .",
    "[ eq : linc ] shows that there are two contributions to the the energy shift of the lower polariton : coherent @xmath93 and incoherent @xmath94 .",
    "the long - lived incoherent exciton population @xmath52 contributes to the energy blue shift of the lower polariton at large positive pump - probe delays .",
    "this small eid ( @xmath95 ) starts to appear in the lower polariton already at a cavity detuning of -0.5 mev ( not shown ) , but further investigation is necessary to precisely determine this .",
    "finally , we discuss a possible origin of these incoherent exciton generation process and eid effect .",
    "since a scattering from the lower polariton state to the exciton reservoir with a large momentum does not satisfy energy - momentum conservation , we can not employ the same scattering picture as for the upper polariton excitation case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "one possibility would be two - photon absorption process associated with a  heating process \" as in @xcite , however this would not explain the detuning dependence that we observe .",
    "a simple explanation is that there is some finite overlap of the excitonic state with the lp branch . while this would explain the detuning dependence , this effect is likely to be very small and depend linearly on power",
    "alternatively , the power dependence ( _ i.e. , _ eid term ) of the reservoir generation could be interpreted as a polariton - polariton auger - like recombination , which would destroy one polariton and excite another into a state which could relax into the reservoir .",
    "apart from the mechanisms described above , one should also consider a non - linear source term that is active when the polarizations induced by both the pump and probe pulses are temporally overlapping in the microcavity .",
    "this coherent source term corresponds to a four - wave mixing contribution that causes the scattering to the reservoir of excitons of one polariton generated by the pump pulse in the lower polariton branch with one polariton generated by the probe pulse in the upper polariton branch .",
    "this term takes the following form in the polariton equation of motion : _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath96 .",
    "this contribution will be effective if and only if the total energy of the pump , lower polariton , and that of the probe upper polariton exceeds twice the exciton energy .",
    "this term was theoretically derived by savasta _ et .",
    "al . , _ in @xcite",
    "; see the eq . 7 in that article . by including this new coherent term in eq .",
    "10 , we reproduce the essential features of the probe transmission signal when pumping the lower polariton branch with a spectrally narrow pulse ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : addcoh ] ) : a long lived blueshifted polariton mode ( at positive delay ) and an enhancement of the probe transmission from negative to positive delays .",
    "this last feature of the data is not captured by the simulation with the standard set of polaritonic bloch eqs .",
    "( 9),(10),(11 ) , see comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme_pos ] . the closer agreement of the simulation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : addcoh ] with the experimental data demonstrate the relevance of this new coherent term as an effective source of excitation induced dephasing , which occurs when polaritons from the pump scatter with polaritons from the probe pulse .",
    "this new coherent term originates from the non - markovian nature of the exciton - exciton interaction when going beyond the usual hartree - fock approximation and corresponds to four - particle correlations@xcite .",
    "lastly , several state of the art microscopic calculations show that the eid strength is highly energy - dependent and becomes large when the energy of the two scattered polaritons exceeds twice the exciton energy @xcite .",
    "this might also explain the onset of the lower polariton eid towards positive cavity detuning .    ) , scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated under which conditions the polariton dynamics can be regarded as coherent or incoherent . for negative cavity detuning ( -1.2 mev ) , excitation of the lower polariton can be treated in the coherent limit , thus the conventional gross - pitaevskii equation holds . on the contrary ,",
    "when exciting the upper polariton branch , there is a quick transfer to the incoherent exciton population due to the strong dephasing effects for all cavity detunings investigated . for positive cavity detunings ( _ e.g. , _ 1.1 mev )",
    ", the dephasing of lower polaritons also occurs rapidly and leads to a population in the excitonic reservoir , whatever the pumping conditions .",
    "these findings have strong implications for the design of coherent polaritonic devices , indicating a very limited region of parameter space which is free of coherence destroying dephasing effects .",
