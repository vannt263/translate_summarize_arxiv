    "discovery of a new superconducting family of feas - based superconductors has generated an explosion of research activity  @xcite .",
    "the superconductors in this family were produced by doping a parent compound , refeaso ( `` 1111 '' phase , re - rare earth ) with electrons by substitution of fluorine for oxygen , or by some oxygen deficiency . the highest @xmath6 obtained this way is 55 k in  @xcite smfeaso@xmath7f@xmath8 .",
    "hole doping by substituting strontium for rare earth also leads to superconductivity  @xcite with a @xmath9 k. later , superconductivity in a related material bafe@xmath10as@xmath10 ( these are termed `` 122 '' materials ) was discovered  @xcite , where again , superconductivity occurs by doping either electrons ( e.g. co on fe site , @xmath11 k ) or holes ( e.g. k on ba site , @xmath12 k ) . the parent ( undoped ) compounds of both 1111 and 122 materials are antiferromagnetic metals with a spin - density wave setting in at around 130 k  @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface consists of multiple sheets , electron- and hole - like in character  @xcite . of the superconducting properties ,",
    "most basic are the two ginzburg - landau length scales : the @xmath13-plane values for the coherence length @xmath14 is about 2 - 3 nm ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the magnetic penetration depth @xmath15 nm ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite )    in this work we concentrate on ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 superconductor with a @xmath16 k , as a member of the iron pnictides 1111-family . like other pnictide superconducting compounds",
    ", it too has a layered , anisotropic crystal structure .",
    "recently , the synthesis of small single crystals of such high @xmath6 , 1111 iron pnictide superconductors has enabled characterization of some anisotropic superconducting properties  @xcite .",
    "it is important to further elucidate properties determined by strong basal - plane supercurrents . for such purposes , an alternative to small single crystals ( typical mass @xmath17 g  @xcite )",
    "is a large collection of small crystallites ( here , total mass @xmath18 mg ) , whose orientation has been made to have a nearly common @xmath19axis by magnetic alignment .",
    "such samples actually have some advantages over small single crystals , since a sub - micron grain size allows higher sensitivity to small changes in magnetic penetration depth , while the large number of particles provides a strong signal .",
    "therefore , it is possible to conduct meaningful measurements using low - frequency and @xmath20 techniques . in this article",
    "we report on making such a sample and our findings from both the high field persistent ( critical state ) currents and the low field screening .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of feas , ndf@xmath21 , nd@xmath10o@xmath21 , and nd metal were ground together in a helium glove box , pressed into a pellet and sealed in a silica ampoule with 0.25 atmosphere of ar gas .",
    "the pellet with nominal composition of ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 was heated to 1200@xmath22 c for 15 h. powder x - ray diffraction gave the correct phase with about 2 - 5% of ndas , feas , and ndof impurities .",
    "the @xmath6 was 48 k , as determined by the low - field @xmath23 and @xmath20 susceptibility .",
    "nm and approximately equiaxial shape ]    a polycrystalline piece of ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 was mechanically ground to a fine powder , such that each particle constitutes a single grain .",
    "we did not use any sieve to remove large particles .",
    "a ten mg quantity of the as - ground powder was mixed with clear epoxy ( hardman 04004 , setting time 1 hour ) in a cylindrical gelatin capsule and placed in a magnetic field of 6 t , which aligns the powder particles with @xmath13 planes parallel to the field .",
    "a similar phenomenon was noted by h .- j .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and b. c. chang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite although in those cases the rare earth ions were respectively spinless la@xmath24 , and sm@xmath24 with a magnetic moment of @xmath25 , while in our case it is nd@xmath24 ( @xmath26 ground state , which has a magnetic moment of @xmath27 as a free ion ) .",
    "therefore such an alignment can not be ascribed to rare - earth magnetism , but rather results from layered , anisotropic crystal structure .",
    "we have performed the alignment procedure at room temperature in two steps to obtain @xmath2-axis orientation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] . in the first step ,",
    "field was applied perpendicular to the capsule axis , which produced a sample with @xmath2 axis randomly distributed in the plane perpendicular to the applied field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray](a ) ) . after about half hour",
    ", the capsule was rotated @xmath28 about its long axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray](b ) ) and the epoxy was allowed to set . as a result , particles reoriented to align with a common @xmath2-axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray](c ) ) , with a possible exception of a very small number of particles , whose @xmath2-axis was perpendicular to the capsule axis after the first alignment step .",
    "the total powder volume was @xmath29 mm@xmath30 and the approximate capsule volume of 100 mm@xmath30 resulted in a dilute @xmath31 vol .",
    "% particle composite dispersed in the epoxy matrix .",
    "grain alignment was confirmed using a 4-circle x - ray diffractometer with a cu k@xmath32 source ( 50 kv , 100 ma ) , a sagitally focusing graphite monochromator , soller slits , and a nai scintillation detector .",
    "a @xmath33 scan ( fig .  [ fig : xray](d ) ) shows that the ( 003 ) and ( 004 ) reflections are enhanced relative to a random powder and the rocking curve for the ( 004 ) reflection is about 18@xmath22 fwhm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray](e ) ) .",
    "this orientation spread is acceptable for studies of in - plane magnetic properties with field along the @xmath2 axis , but is too large if one wishes to study the behavior in parallel field .",

    "an azimuthal ( @xmath35 ) scan at a 37@xmath22 tilt ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray](f ) ) shows that the ( 114 ) intensity has a weak 2-fold variation which we attribute to the sample shape , i.e. there is no indication of an azimuthal grain alignment , which would produce at least a 4-fold symmetry",

    "inset : grain size distribution function , obtained by light scattering from a sample of the powder . ]    for a quantitative analysis of magnetic data on such samples it is necessary to know the particle size distribution . an sem image of a particle on a holey carbon tem sample grid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : particle ] ) shows a diameter of approximately 200 nm and close to an equiaxed particle shape .",
    "more detailed information about particle sizes was obtained using a nicomp zls particle sizing system  @xcite , which deduces particle size distribution from temporal correlations in intensity of light scattered off the particles diffusing in a liquid of a known viscosity and refraction index ( we used diffusion pump fluid 704 ) .",
    "the output , a smooth log - normal distribution @xmath37 ( fig .  [ fig : anisotropy ] inset ) , shows that most of the particles are in sub - micron range . in a small applied field ,",
    "superconducting particles smaller than a magnetic penetration depth produce little diamagnetism .",
    "rather , the particles in the tail of the distribution , in the range of about a micron and above , most affect the measurement .",
    "therefore the knowledge of the distribution tail is vital for quantitative analysis .    following the sample preparation we have confirmed that at room temperature the magnetization was higher for field along the @xmath13 plane , than along the @xmath2 axis , as shown in fig .",

    "the extracted @xmath42 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst](b )",
    ". apparently , values for the in - plane critical current are relatively high .",
    "for example , at @xmath45 k and applied field @xmath46 t the critical current density is about 0.3 ma/@xmath47 .",
    "it should be mentioned , that the magnitude of the @xmath42 is very sensitive to small uncertainties in the size distribution .",
    "the relative values are , of course , quite well defined .",
    "the magnetic field dependence in fig .  [ fig : hyst](b ) exhibits a distinct region of power - law behavior , @xmath48 with a nearly temperature - independent value for @xmath32 of about 0.38 except near @xmath6 , at 40 k. a weak dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath5 has been found in high-@xmath6 cuprate coatings as well  @xcite . unlike other reports in the literature on the irreversible properties of iron - arsenides  @xcite , we do not observe any `` peak '' or `` fishtail '' effects in @xmath49 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hyst](c ) shows the temperature dependence of the background paramagnetism , which is predominantly due to nd ions .",
    "this magnetic background has been estimated from the hysteresis loops of fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst](a ) as follows : first , a mean of the upper and lower hysteresis branch is calculated for each loop , as a proxy to the equilibrium magnetization @xmath50 .",
    "these are shown in fig.[fig : hyst](a ) as solid blue lines .",
    "then , a tangent to such center line , passing through origin , is constructed ( for @xmath45 k this is shown in fig.[fig : hyst](a ) by the red dashed line ) .",

    "the curie - weiss fit to these values , @xmath52 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst](c ) ) produces a positive @xmath53 k , pointing to antiferromagnetic coupling between nd ions and an effective nd magnetic moment of about 2@xmath54 , i.e. about 60% of the free nd@xmath24 ion value . for @xmath55",
    "the magnetic susceptibility decreased with increasing @xmath5 , but could not be accurately described by a curie - weiss dependence .",
    "we attribute this , as well as the reduction in the inferred nd@xmath24 magnetic moment value compared to that of a free ion to crystal - field effects in the aligned array of particles .",

    "[ fig : mt ] ) .",
    "the drive amplitude and frequency were @xmath60 oe and @xmath61 khz respectively .",
    "the epoxy had a weak , temperature - independent diamagnetism , about 0.2% that of the sample s signal at low temperature .",
    "this background has been subtracted from the data . knowing the particle size distribution @xmath37 , from the measured @xmath59 we can extract the magnetic penetration depth @xmath62 , using the equation @xmath63 where",
    ", assuming spherical particles , we have a fraction of the grain s volume from which magnetic flux is excluded  @xcite @xmath64 $ ] and the demagnetizing ratio @xmath65 .",
    "this is a straightforward technique , which generally agrees very well with other methods  @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the relatively few large particles produce most of the diamagnetic signal . unfortunately , the large @xmath66 tail of the size distribution is not known with enough accuracy to obtain reliable determination of the absolute value of the penetration depth .",
    "in contrast , the temperature dependence of @xmath62 is far less sensitive to uncertainties in size distribution , as shown below , so that we can obtain valuable results for the variation of @xmath62 with temperature .",
    "circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda](a ) show the @xmath67 extracted from the as - measured magnetization .",
    "there is a maximum near 10 k , below which the diamagnetism is reduced by the underlying nd ion paramagnetism , as is evident also in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt ] .",
    "clearly , the nd magnetic signal must be accounted for . knowing the paramagnetic background from the previous section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst](c ) ) , we can do such a correction .",
    "we demonstrate here that , while it is possible to under - correct for the magnetic background and make the measurements appear to be consistent with a fully gapped state ( with two different gaps on different fermi sheets ) , a proper treatment of the background points toward an unconventional pairing or possibly a strong pair - breaking .",
    "the nd ion paramagnetism provides two contributions to the overall signal , as discussed by j. r. cooper  @xcite .",
    "first , the paramagnetic signal comes from the grain s field - penetrated part , whose volume fraction is given by @xmath68 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , to subtract this paramagnetic signal we must replace @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) by @xmath70 .",
    "after such correction , the data of fig .  [",
    "fig : lambda](a ) show no maximum at any temperature ( green triangles ) , but rather flat behavior at low temperatures , consistent with a fully - gapped state . on closer inspection",
    ", no simple @xmath71-wave bcs calculation fits the corrected data satisfactorily . instead , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda](a ) by the dashed black line , we obtain a good fit by assuming two gaps , with @xmath72 values @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the smaller gap producing a quarter of the total superfluid fraction . to obtain the gap temperature dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda](b ) ) , the self - consistent bcs equation was solved numerically . as mentioned above",
    ", the shape of the @xmath75 curve depends only weakly on how well the size distribution is known . for reference ,",
    "a change in particle size distribution that would decrease @xmath76 by about a factor of 100 , changes the large and small gap magnitudes to 2 and 1.23 of @xmath77 respectively , and the relative weight of the smaller gap increases to about 35% .",
    "therefore , based on the correction @xmath78 alone it could be concluded that this superconductor is fully gapped and is described well by the clean - limit bcs theory with two different gaps .",
    "indeed , many authors have arrived at such a conclusion , as discussed below .",
    "extracted from the measured susceptibility @xmath79 . @xmath80- without corrections , -corrected for extra signal from field - penetrated part , -additionally corrected for magnetic permeability .",
    "solid and dashed lines show quadratic and 2-gap bcs fits , respectively(b ) the @xmath81dependence of the superconducting gaps , used in two - gap bcs fit of .",
    "( c ) enlarged low - temperature region , showing quadratic temperature dependence of the @xmath82    there is a second correction , however , that must be made in order to fully account for the magnetic background , and this one comes from the magnetic permeability in the london equation , @xmath83 , which describes the shielding of the magnetic field in the interior of a superconductor  @xcite . for a magnetic material like ndfeasof , @xmath84 must be replaced with @xmath85 ( factor of @xmath86 is because the latter formula is in si units , while values of fig .  [",
    "fig : hyst](c ) are calculated in gaussian units , and there is a difference of @xmath86 between si and gaussian values of magnetic susceptibility )",
    ". then @xmath87 must be multiplied by @xmath88 to obtain the true london penetration depth @xmath4 , which is the measure of the density of the superconducting condensate .",
    "this is shown by blue diamonds in the fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda](a ) and ( c ) . at low temperatures these are best fit with a parabola @xmath89 ( solid blue line , fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda](c ) ) . similar analysis and result can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , from which we have gleaned the idea of this second correction . in that work , the role of @xmath90 is negligible due to large size of the sample , most of which is shielded from the magnetic field , while the correction for @xmath91 is large due to a much lower value of the curie - weiss @xmath92 k , treated as a fit parameter there , resulting in a much stronger @xmath5-dependence of @xmath51 near @xmath72 compared with the present work where @xmath53 k has been obtained independently .",
    "there have been several reports on the temperature dependence of the superfluid density in various 1111 oxy - pnictides . from experimental work",

    "@xcite there is a common agreement that the superconducting state is fully gapped and can be accounted for by two gaps on different sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "this manifests itself in temperature - independent @xmath95 at low temperatures , followed by convex temperature dependence .",
    "it is possible that this result would be different , had the proper corrections been applied . on the theoretical front , l. benfatto _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have developed a model , where the superconducting properties are determined by an interband coupling between one electron- and one hole - like bands .",

    "[ fig : lambda ] quantitatively : @xmath97 and @xmath98 . the experiments of l. malone",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite provide similar estimates of two gap magnitudes .",

    "@xcite also argue in favor of two gaps on different fermi surface sheets , but find a @xmath99 behavior of @xmath100 in single crystals of both ndfeaso@xmath93f@xmath94 and lafeaso@xmath93f@xmath94 ( where for the latter the paramagnetic background is absent and interpretation is more straightforward ) .",
    "their findings are similar to the present result ( blue diamonds , fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda](a ) and ( c ) ) suggesting a possibility of unconventional superconductivity .",
    "we would caution that in and of itself , the quadratic temperature dependence of the superfluid density can not be taken as a sure sign of unconventional superconductivity .",
    "for example , in nb / ni bilayers the superfluid density displays a quadratic @xmath5-dependence due to pair - breaking proximity effect between superconducting nb and ferromagnetic ni ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with the proposed @xmath101 pairing state of iron - pnictides",
    "@xcite the roles of magnetic and non - magnetic scatterers are expected to be interchanged : non - magnetic scattering will broaden the peak in the superconducting density of states until eventually one or both gaps close ( perhaps not everywhere on the fermi surface at once ) , while magnetic scattering will tend to make gaps equal in magnitude and reduce gap anisotropy by connecting states from different parts of the fermi surface ( anderson theorem ) .",
    "nagai et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed a case of anisotropic gap on the electron - like fermi surface ( around the @xmath102 point of the brillouin zone ) and have shown , in particular , that the observed power - law temperature behavior of the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath103(ref .",
    "@xcite ) , considered by many to be at odds with a fully gapped state , finds a plausible explanation in that approach : while the density of states is fully gapped ( @xmath104 for @xmath105 ) , it varies linearly with energy in the interval @xmath106 , a feature reminiscent of the @xmath107-wave situation in cuprates .",
    "we note that a qualitatively similar behavior of @xmath108 , i.e. a finite sub - gap quasiparticle density of states could result from non - magnetic scattering .",
    "overall , the question of the pairing state in iron oxypnictides is far from resolution at this stage .",
    "there have been several reports on the critical current densities of 1111 materials , all extracted from magnetic hysteresis of polycrystalline samples by means of the bean model  @xcite .",
    "the shortcoming of this approach is that the spatial scale of supercurrent circulation is often unknown : it can be given by an individual grain size ( probably the case near @xmath6 and/or in high fields ) , or by the sample size , which is likely at low temperatures and fields in well connected materials  @xcite .",
    "the resulting inferred critical current density can differ by two orders of magnitude . in a single crystal of the 122 material ba@xmath93k@xmath94fe@xmath10as@xmath10 , the in - plane critical current density reaches  @xcite close to @xmath109 a/@xmath47 at 2 k , 0 t , a value comparable to our result .",

    "the temperature dependence of the superfluid density , after proper corrections for background paramagnetism , is quadratic , which alone does not enable us to come to a conclusion regarding the nature of the pairing state .",
