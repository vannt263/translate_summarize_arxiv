    "there has been recently an increasing interest in the study of networks which are not usual regular lattices .",
    "this growing interest , principally among physicists , comes mainly from the fact that they can model complex systems in real world networks @xcite . in special , small - world ( sw ) networks",
    "@xcite have been much studied as they furnish a simple way to attempt to describe complex topologies such as social and economic organizations , the speed of disease spread , connectivities of computers , just to cite a few of them @xcite .",
    "as is usual , a rigorous treatment to get the properties of a real physical realization on such complex systems is a quite difficult task .",
    "however , one expects that simple theoretical models , such as the discrete spin ising model , could be able to capture the main features of the actual complicated processes occurring on real networks . in this direction ,",
    "the spin-@xmath4 ising model has been studied on sw networks and , for exchange interactions which are independent of the length distance of the spins , one gets a second - order phase transition at a finite critical temperature @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "snches et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the asymmetric directed sw networks and for an ising like spin system they showed that a first - order phase transition takes place when the rewiring probability @xmath6 is greater than a critical value @xmath7 .",
    "the same result has been achieved by lima et al . when treating the spin-@xmath8 and @xmath9 ising model on the same networks @xcite .",
    "in most of the above theoretical models the undirected , as well as the directed sw networks , have been constructed by taking , as an initial step , a regular pure hypercubic lattice @xcite .",
    "it will be very interesting , thus , to see what should be the behavior of sw networks built up over an already random system , such as the voronoi - delaunay random lattices .",
    "so , in this paper , we study the spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model on undirected and directed sw networks constructed from an initial voronoi - delaunay random lattice .",
    "the purpose here is indeed two - fold : first , we would like to see the effect of the disorder itself on the spin-@xmath0 model on this undirected lattice ( since , for the spin-@xmath10 model @xcite there has been a change in its universality class ) and , secondly , the behavior of spin models on sw networks obtained from random number of nearest neighbors . in the next section we present the sw networks , the model and the simulation background . the results and discussions are presented in the last section .",
    "_ undirected voronoi - delaunay random lattice _ - the voronoi construction , or tessellation , for a given set of points in the plane can be defined as follows @xcite .",
    "initially , for each point one determines the polygonal cell consisting of the region of space nearer to that point than any other point .",
    "then one considers that the two cells are neighboring when they possess an extremity in common . from the voronoi tessellation",
    "the dual lattice can be obtained by the following procedure : @xmath11 when two cells are neighbors , a link is placed between the two points located in the cells ; @xmath12 from the links one obtains the triangulation of space that is called the delaunay lattice ; @xmath13 the delaunay lattice is dual to the voronoi tessellation in the sense that points corresponding to cells link to edges , and triangles to the vertices of the voronoi tessellation .",
    "_ directed voronoi - delaunay sw network _ - we use here the same process defined by snchez et al . @xcite for directing the voronoi - delaunay random lattice . in this case",
    ", we start with the voronoi construction , or tessellation , as described in the previous paragraph , by creating the random two - dimensional lattice consisting of sites linked to their nearest neighbors by both outgoing and incoming links .",
    "then , with probability @xmath6 , we reconnect nearest - neighbor outgoing links to a different site chosen at random . after repeating this process for every link ,",
    "we are left with a network with a density @xmath6 of random two - dimensional lattice _ directed _ links .",
    "therefore , with this procedure every site will have exactly the same amount of _ undirected _ random two - dimensional lattice outgoing links and a varying ( random ) number of incoming links .",
    "_ model _ - we consider now the two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model on these poissonian random lattices .",
    "the blume - capel model is a generalization of the standard ising model @xcite and was originally proposed for spin-@xmath0 to account for first - order phase transition in magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath14 where the first sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites ( points in the voronoi construction ) and the spin-@xmath0 variables @xmath15 assume values @xmath16 . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath17 is the exchange coupling and @xmath18 is the single ion anisotropy parameter . the second sum is taken over the @xmath19 spins on a @xmath20-dimensional lattice .",
    "the case where @xmath21 has been extensively studied by several approximate techniques in two- and three - dimensions and its phase diagram is well established @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath22 has also been investigated according to several procedures @xcite .",
    "_ simulations _ - the simulations have been performed for @xmath23 , which is the simplest case and where we have some results in the literature to compare with .",
    "the lattices comprised different sizes with @xmath19 ranging from @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath19 is total umber of sites .",
    "for simplicity , the linear length of the system is defined here in terms of the size of a regular two - dimensional lattice @xmath26 . for each system size quenched averages over the connectivity disorder are approximated by averaging over @xmath27 ( @xmath28 to @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) independent realizations .",
    "for each simulation we have started with a uniform configuration of spins ( the results are , however , independent of the initial configuration ) .",
    "we ran @xmath34 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per spin with @xmath35 configurations discarded for thermalization using the  perfect \" random - number generator @xcite . in both cases",
    "we have employed the heat bath algorithm and for every @xmath36th mcs , the energy per spin , @xmath37 , and magnetization per spin , @xmath38 , were measure and recorded in a time series file . from these thermodynamic quantities",
    "the behavior of the transition can be analyzed .    from the series of the energy measurements we can compute , by re - weighting over a controllable temperature interval @xmath39 , the average energy , the specific heat , and the energy fourth - order cumulant which are respectively given by @xmath40_{av}/n,\\ ] ] @xmath41_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath42_{av},\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath43 , with a normalized exchange @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant . in the above equations @xmath46 stands for thermodynamic averages and @xmath47_{av}$ ] for averages over the different realizations .",
    "similarly , we can derive from the magnetization measurements the average magnetization , the susceptibility , and the magnetic cumulants , @xmath48_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath49_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath50_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath51_{av}.\\ ] ] further useful quantities involving both the energy and magnetization are their derivatives @xmath52_{av}}{dk}=[<|m|e>-<|m|><e>]_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath53_{av}}{dk}=[\\frac{<|m|e>}{<|m|>}-<e>]_{av},\\ ] ] @xmath54_{av}}{dk}=[\\frac{<|m^{2}|e>}{<|m^{2}|>}-<e>]_{av}.\\ ] ]    in order to get the transition temperature , as well as to determine the order of the transition of this model , we apply the finite - size scaling ( fss ) procedure .",
    "initially , we search for the minima of the energy fourth - order cumulant given by eq .",
    "this quantity gives a qualitative , as well as a quantitative , description of the order of the transition @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is known @xcite that this parameter takes a minimum value @xmath55 at the effective transition temperature @xmath56 .",
    "one can also show @xcite that for a second - order transition , @xmath57 @xmath58 , even at @xmath59 , while at a first - order transition the same limit measuring the same quantity is small and @xmath60 .",
    "a more quantitative analysis can be carried out through the fss of the energy fluctuation @xmath61 , the susceptibility maxima @xmath62 , and the minima of the binder cumulants @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "if the hypothesis of a first - order phase transition is correct , we should then expect , for large systems sizes , an asymptotic fss behavior of the form @xcite , @xmath66",
    "@xmath67 @xmath68    on the other hand , if the hypothesis of a second - order phase transition is correct , we should then expect , for large systems sizes , an asymptotic fss behavior of the form @xmath69,\\ ] ] @xmath70_{av}=l^{-\\beta/\\nu}f_{m}(x)[1+ ... ],\\ ] ] @xmath71,\\ ] ] @xmath72_{av}}{dk}=l^{1/\\nu}f_{p}(x)[1+ ... ],\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is a regular background term , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are the usual critical exponents , and @xmath78 are fss functions with @xmath79 being the scaling variable , and the brackets @xmath80 $ ] indicate corrections - to - scaling terms .    in all cases , we estimated the error bars from the fluctuations among the different realizations .",
    "note that these errors contain both , the average thermodynamic error for a given realization and the theoretical variance for infinitely accurate thermodynamic averages which are caused by the variation of the quenched , random geometry of the lattices .",
    "by applying standard re - weighting techniques to each of the @xmath81 time - series data we first determined the temperature dependence of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , ... , @xmath84, ... ,@xmath81 , in the neighborhood of the simulation point @xmath85 .",
    "once the temperature dependence is known for each realization , we can easily compute the disorder average , e.g. , @xmath86 , and then determine the maxima of the averaged quantities , e.g. , @xmath87 .",
    "the variable @xmath81 represents the number of replicas in our simulations .    in order to estimate the critical temperature we calculate the second and fourth - order binder cumulants given by eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , respectively .",
    "it is well known that these quantities are independent of the system size and should intercept at the critical temperature @xcite . in fig . [ cum ] the fourth - order binder cumulant is shown as a function of the @xmath88 for several values of @xmath19 . taking the largest lattices we have @xmath89 . to estimate @xmath90 we note that it varies little at @xmath91 so we have @xmath92 . from the second - order cumulant ( not shown ) we similarly get @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "one can see that the agreement of the critical temperature is quite good and @xmath90 is definitely close to the universal value @xmath95 for the same model on the regular @xmath96 lattice .",
    "the correlation length exponent can be estimated from the derivatives given by eq .",
    "figure [ expnu ] shows the maxima of the logarithm derivatives as a function of the logarithm of the lattice size @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 . from the linear",
    "fitting one gets @xmath100 ( @xmath98 ) and @xmath101 ( @xmath99 ) , which is again next to the regular lattice exponent @xmath102 .    in order to go",
    "further in our analysis we also computed the modulus of the magnetization at the inflection point and the maximum of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the logarithm of these quantities as a function of the logarithm of @xmath97 are presented in figures [ mag ] and [ sus ] , respectively .",
    "a linear fit of these data gives @xmath103 from the magnetization and @xmath104 from the susceptibility which should be compared to @xmath105 and @xmath106 obtained for a regular @xmath96 lattice .",
    "one can see that for this undirected random lattice we get the same universal critical behavior as the regular lattice model , in the same way as has been reported for the diluted spin-@xmath4 ising model @xcite .      in fig .",

    "@xmath113 , a second - order transition takes place since in the @xmath57 @xmath114 , even at @xmath59 .",
