    "the magnetoresistive ( mr ) manganites@xcite of the type ( re , a)mno@xmath1 ( re and a are trivalent rare - earth and divalent ions respectively ) have been studied with a broad spectrum of experimental techniques including the ultrafast pump - probe time - resolved spectroscopy.@xcite most of the time - resolved studies were focused on the metallic / magnetoresistive part of the phase diagram.@xcite while the charge ordered part of the phase diagram has been studied less extensively@xcite .    near mid - doping , where the ratio between number of mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5 ions is around 1 , there is a strong competition between the charge ordered ( co ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) state and the metallic ferromagnetic ( fm ) state .",
    "it has been shown that the co state near mid - doping melts under intense photoexcitation@xcite , while the low photoexcitation dynamics has not been systematically studied in this doping range .    in nd@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath1 near mid - doping ( @xmath8 there is a very narrow region of @xmath9 where two successive phase transitions are observed when the temperature is decreased below room temperature .",
    "the first is the transition to the metallic state which is followed by the transition to the co phase at lower temperature.@xcite the stability of the co phase is very sensitive to external perturbations such as magnetic field@xcite , substrate - induced strain@xcite , photoexcitation@xcite , etc .    to improve our understanding of the dynamics in the mr manganites and the stability of the co phase near mid - doping we applied the low - excitation - fluence ultrafast pump - probe time - resolved spectroscopy to a thin film of pseudocubic nd@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath1 with @xmath10 , in which co is suppressed due to the substrate - induced strain .",
    "we observe a different response on different timescales .",
    "the response on the 10 - 100-ps timescale is similar to the response observed in the metallic / magnetoresistive part of the phase diagram.@xcite the sub - ps response displays a two component behavior at lower temperatures which we attribute to the layered inhomogeneity of the film due to the substrate - induced strain in the film .",
    "a sample of nd@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath1 thin film with nominal composition @xmath11 was deposited on an 110-oriented srtio@xmath1 substrate by the aerosol mocvd@xcite .",
    "the pseudocubic 110 direction of the thin film was found to be parallel to the 110 direction of the substrate .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment parallel to the film and the film resistance @xmath12 , shown in fig .",
    "1 , indicate a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) with an onset at @xmath13 k and a peak of @xmath14 at @xmath15 k. despite the nominal sr concentration @xmath16 the transition to the charge ordered ( co ) state which is observed below @xmath17 k in bulk samples was not observed in the resistivity measurements .",
    "the absence of the co transition could be either due to a minor discrepancy of the real cation composition from the nominal one or more likely due to the strain resulting from the film - substrate lattice constant mismatch . in magnetic moment temperature dependence we observe a kink at 103k the kink is absent in high magnetic field ( 45000 oe ) indicating that it is not due to the background susceptibility of the srtio@xmath1 substrate which has a structural phase transition in the range 80 - 105k depending on impurities .",
    "we used a mode locked ti : sapphire laser operating at @xmath18 = 800 nm ( 1.5 ev ) as a source of pump and probe pulses .",
    "the train of @xmath1960-fs - long pump laser pulses was focused on a 60-@xmath3m - diameter spot giving an optical fluence of @xmath195 @xmath3j/@xmath20 per pulse .",
    "the train of appropriately delayed probe pulses , which had the fluence 50 - 100 times weaker than the pump pulses , was reflected from the same spot and detected by a photodiode .",
    "the probe pulses were polarized orthogonally to the pump polarization and a polarization analyzer which was oriented perpendicularly to the pump polarization was mounted in front of the photodiode to eliminate the signal due to pump scattering .",
    "high frequency modulation ( 200 khz ) of the pump beam intensity enabled low - noise lock - in detection of the photoinduced reflectivity @xmath21 ( pir ) .",
    "the thickness of the film was approximately one optical penetration depth estimated from its optical density .",
    "other details of the experimental pump - probe setup were published elsewhere.@xcite    the sample was mounted on a cold finger of an optical liquid - he flow cryostat .",
    "due to laser heating , the temperature of the illuminated sample volume was estimated to be less than 15 k above the cryostat temperature@xcite , which was directly measured using a rhfe resistor .",
    "we observed no change of pir transients when the pump polarization is rotated relative to the thin - film crystal - axes .",
    "a typical measured pir transient is shown in fig .",
    "the transient is characterized by three delay regions annotated by capital letters a , b and c in fig .",
    "2 . at negative delay times ( region a )",
    "we observe a delay - independent pir background , which represents the pir build - up due to relaxation / diffusion processes significantly longer than the inter - pulse separation of 12.5 ns .",
    "the pir - background amplitude is temperature dependent as shown in fig .",
    "3 . the lock - in out - of - phase signal , which is delay - independent within the full delay range , is also shown in the same plot for comparison .",
    "the out - of - phase lock - in signal actually corresponds to the pir which persists during the  dark  part of the 200-khz pump modulation period .",
    "it has virtually the same temperature dependence as the pir background , with the only difference being a different sign , implying a temperature independent @xmath22 phase shift of the induced reflectivity at 200-khz with respect to the pump modulation .",
    "the timescale associated with the pir background is therefore of the order of @xmath3s@xmath23 the magnitudes of both signals exhibit a peak at @xmath24240 k and the signals change sign at @xmath19260 k. taking into account the @xmath1910-k temperature difference of the illuminated sample volume relative to the cryostat temperature the background - peak temperature roughly coincides with the @xmath25-peak while the sign change coincides with @xmath26 .    to aid the analysis of the pir  transients on the sub - ns timescale we substract the corresponding delay independent background offsets discussed above .",
    "we refer to the modified transients as ultrafast - pir ( upir ) transients . in fig .",
    "4 we show upir transients at different temperatures .",
    "we observe two well separated timescales ( region b and region c in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "4 ) in which the transients show different temperature dependences .",
    "the regions are separated by a break in fig .",
    "region b includes dynamics up to @xmath27 ps while region c includes slower dynamics up to @xmath19250 ps .",
    "let us first look closer at the temperature dependence of the slower transients ( region c ) . at room temperature ,",
    "the upir transient is negative and virtually flat for delays larger than @xmath191 ps .",
    "when the temperature is decreased below 260 k a new exponential relaxation component appears , leading to a change of sign of the upir transient at longer delay times .",
    "the temperature dependences of the relaxation time and the amplitude of the component are plotted in fig .",
    "5 .    at maximum delay ( 250 ps )",
    "the upir transient magnitude is finite in the whole temperature range except around @xmath28 k indicating the presence of a longer , nanosecond - timescale relaxation process .",
    "similar to the pir background , it exhibits a change of sign at @xmath19260 k but is virtually temperature independent below 240 k as shown in fig .",
    "let us now discuss the ultrafast response _ above _",
    "@xmath29 _",
    "k _ for delays up to @xmath27 ps . in this range",
    "the upir transient is negative ( @xmath30 ) with a 130-fs - long leading edge which is followed by a @xmath31 fs exponential decay continuing into the slow relaxation component described above .",
    "the @xmath32-fs risetime is temperature independent in this range .",
    "the magnitude of the upir transient peak located at @xmath33 fs increases with decreasing temperature exhibiting a broad extremum at 240 k and decreasing again when the temperature is further decreased as seen in fig .",
    "the @xmath34-fs relaxation time is only weakly sensitive to the mit as seen from fig .",
    "7 ( a ) showing a slight increase when the temperature is lowered towards @xmath35 and a slight decrease below @xmath26 .",
    "unfortunately , additional noise due to the large pir background , which appears in this temperature range , causes scatter in the data and prevents a more precise determination of the fast relaxation - time temperature dependence .",
    "when the temperature is decreased _ below _ @xmath2 _",
    "k _ the sub - ps component experiences a remarkable change in shape ( see fig .",
    "firstly between 160 - 100 k the leading edge shifts together with the peak by @xmath36 fs towards the positive delay .",
    "in addition , the peak broadens and at 80 k disappears . below 80 k a positive and slightly steeper leading edge centered again at the zero - delay",
    "is observed followed by a positive peak at @xmath37 fs delay and a minimum around @xmath38 fs .",
    "after the minimum the upir transients still increase slightly on a timescale of @xmath34 fs followed by the slow relaxation component already described .",
    "the major changes of the shape of the sub - ps upir transients appear at similar temperature as the kink in the magnetic moment temperature dependence when the @xmath1910-k laser heating of the illuminated volume is taken into account .",
    "the 1.5 ev photon energy used in the present experiment lies in the region of optical transitions between split mn @xmath39derived bands@xcite .",
    "the time resolved optical reflectivity at 1.5 ev photon energy is therefore directly related to the dynamics of charge carriers , which are the most relevant for the physics of mr manganites . in addition , in nd@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath1 the reflectivity edge due to the coherent response at low temperatures is below the probe photon energy . a contribution to the photoinduced reflectivity from the collective charge response due to the free carriers at low temperatures",
    "is therefore expected not to be significant in comparison to the interband contribution .",
    "let us now discuss the different delay regions separately , proceeding from the fastest to the slowest timescale .",
    "_ above _ @xmath2 k the 300-fs relaxation time in our sample is just slightly longer than the 200-fs relaxation time measured by us in la@xmath40pb@xmath41mno@xmath1@xcite and la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath1@xcite . in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath1 lobad _",
    "et al._@xcite report a sub-100-fs absorption transient , but do not discus the transient shape in detail . since our time resolution is @xmath42 fs the 200 - 300-fs relaxation times measured in  nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 and la@xmath40pb@xmath41mno@xmath1 are intrinsic to the samples . however , any additional sub-80-fs components are not completely excluded by our measurements and it is not clear whether significant differences in _ the relaxation time",
    "_ exists between different manganites .",
    "in contrast , _ the amplitude _ of the sub - ps relaxation component clearly behaves differently below @xmath35 in manganites with different compositions on the la site . in la@xmath40pb@xmath41mno@xmath1@xcite",
    "the amplitude increases with decreasing temperature , in la@xmath43sr@xmath44mno@xmath1@xcite the increase in amplitude is less pronounced while in nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 the amplitude even decreases below @xmath35 .",
    "it remains to be more systematically investigated whether this is correlated with the hole doping , as current data suggest , or it is simply connected with the cation species type and/or the ionic radius on the la site .",
    "@xmath2 k the sub - ps behavior in our nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath45 thin film is much more complex than in manganite thin films with smaller hole doping.@xcite despite anomalies observed in the ultrafast optical response and the magnetic moment temperature dependence there is no signature of any anomaly in the resistivity temperature dependence .",
    "this can be explained by the layered inhomogeneity of the film due to the substrate - film lattice - mismatch strain .",
    "it has been shown that thin films of nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 deposited on laalo@xmath45 substrate display a layered structure with a @xmath46 nm thick insulating layer near the substrate and a less strained layer on top , which undergoes mit.@xcite in addition the remaining strain in the top layer of the nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 film is sufficient to almost completely suppress the co transition.@xcite similar behavior was observed also in a la@xmath47sr@xmath48mno@xmath1 thin films.@xcite in our case the substrate lattice parameter is @xmath49 larger than the average pseudocubic lattice parameter of bulk nd@xmath50sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 . despite the strain in our case has different sign than in the case of laalo@xmath1 substrate , the absence of any anomaly in the resistance temperature dependence suggests a similar layered inhomogeneity of the film . since the thickness of the film is of the order of the optical penetration depth optical ( and magnetization ) measurements",
    "detect contributions from top and bottom layers while in the electrical transport measurement the top high - conductivity metallic layer effectively shortens out the bottom insulating layer below mit .",
    "we therefore attribute anomalies observed below @xmath2 k in the sub - ps upir transients to the bottom insulating layer(s ) .",
    "we analyze the transients below @xmath2 k in terms of an additional positive sub - ps exponentially - relaxing component originating from the bottom insulating layer .",
    "the component partially cancels the leading edge of the negative 300-fs component observed above @xmath2 k reproducing the observed leading edge shift , as can be seen from the solid lines in fig .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to extract neither amplitudes nor relaxation - times temperature dependences of both components reliably since the fits are extremely ill - conditioned .",
    "we can therefore only estimate the relaxation time of the additional component to be below 100 fs while the relaxation time of the negative one remains in the 200 - 300 fs range .",
    "let us now discuss the origin of the anomaly attributed to the bottom insulating layer .",
    "the srtio@xmath1 substrate undergoes a second order structural phase transition from cubic to tetragonal symmetry at @xmath51k .",
    "the temperature range at which major anomalies are observed in our nd@xmath50sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 thin film are very similar to this temperature .",
    "however , the leading edge shift of the upir is already evident in the 130-k upir transient well above the substrate structural phase transition .",
    "in addition the substrate lattice parameters splitting below the structural transition is less than @xmath52@xcite which is more than ten times less then the substrate - film lattice mismatch .",
    "we therefore believe that the observed anomaly is not purely substrate induced effect but that it is related to the nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 instability towards co. unfortunately from our data alone we can not determine whether the additional sub-100 fs relaxation is indeed related to co since there is no data yet available on time resolved pir at low excitation densities on charge ordered manganites .",
    "proceeding towards longer timescales we look next at region b. the relaxation on a 100-ps timescale observed in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath1 and la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath1 was attributed to the magnetization relaxation dynamics by lobad",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , while ren _",
    "et al._@xcite attribute it to polaron relaxation dynamics .",
    "it still needs to be confirmed - for example by time resolved faraday rotation measurements - whether the hundred - ps component is indeed related directly to the magnetization relaxation as proposed by lobad _",
    "et al._@xcite . in case of nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1",
    "we observe a similar temperature dependence of the relaxation time of the hundred - ps component as lobad _ et al._@xcite ( fig .",
    "5 ) , although the relaxation is somewhat faster in nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 .    for comparison , in ( la , pb)mno@xmath1@xcite the peaks below @xmath53 in the relaxation - time and amplitude temperature dependences of the hundred - ps component",
    "are not observed .",
    "instead , the relaxation time and the amplitude below @xmath35 steadily increase with the decreasing temperature with a trace of a hump more than 100k below @xmath35 . in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath1 ren _",
    "et al._@xcite report a monotonic decrease of the relaxation time below @xmath35 .",
    "while in la@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath1 the different behavior may be related to the higher fluence used in their experiment , it is not clear at the moment what is the origin of the observed difference in ( la , pb)mno@xmath1 .",
    "one possible reason for the absence of the peak below @xmath35 in ( la , pb)mno@xmath1 is a surplus oxygen content of the film leading to cation vacancies on the mn and la sites .",
    "the disorder could cause faster relaxation due to a broken translation symmetry , but it could also lead to low - lying long - lived localized states .",
    "the contribution from such states can not be excluded on the basis of current data on ( la , pb)mno@xmath45.@xcite    the residual upir transient amplitude at 250 ps measures the amount of decay between successive laser pulses ( 12.5 ns ) .",
    "its temperature dependence is similar to that of the pir background on the @xmath3s timescale with the sign change at 260 k , but without the peak below @xmath35 .",
    "we observe a similar behavior in ( la , pb)mno@xmath1.@xcite the absence of the peak below @xmath35 indicates that the response on the nanosecond timescale is ( at least in part ) _ not bolometric _ in origin , while the change of sign at 260k suggests that the optical transition contributing to pir on both timescales is the same .",
    "let us finally discuss the @xmath3s timescale corresponding to the large temperature dependent pir background .",
    "the slowly decaying signal observed at negative delay times ( region a ) seems to be a general feature present in transient pir on the gmr manganites observed by us@xcite and others@xcite .",
    "its temperature dependence exhibits a peak at the temperature , which is usually of the order of 10 k below @xmath35 , with the exception of ( la , pb)mno@xmath1 , where the peak is @xmath33 k below @xmath53.@xcite    a similar background , albeit with a smaller magnitude , was observed in the high @xmath54cuprates@xcite and the charge density wave ( cdw ) semiconductor k@xmath44moo@xmath1 @xcite . in these cases",
    "the background is peaked at the superconducting / cdw @xmath54 and was attributed to the intragap localized states@xcite .",
    "no corresponding out - of - phase lock - in signal similar to that in the manganites was observed in either the cuprates or k@xmath44moo@xmath1 . despite the fact that the behavior of the background in manganites is somewhat different , we have previously tentatively attributed the pir background to a similar mechanism.@xcite",
    "a detailed analysis of the data presented in this paper suggests that this assignment for _ manganites _ needs to be reconsidered , since in manganites the pir - background temperature dependence and the constant @xmath22 background phase shift are more consistent with a bolometric response as explained below .",
    "the expected amplitude of the bolometrically induced reflectivity change is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the temperature oscillation amplitude .",
    "the specific heat and the thermal conductivity of the substrate and the manganite film@xcite below mit are both relatively smooth functions of temperature without any significant anomalies .",
    "@xmath56 is therefore expected to be a relatively smooth function of temperature , and can contribute neither to the change of the pir - background sign at 260k nor to the observed peak below @xmath35 .",
    "on the other hand , the reflectivity around 1.5 ev in manganites is virtually constant above @xmath35 , but exhibits a systematic drop when the temperature is lowered below @xmath35 with further , albeit slower , decrease towards lower temperatures@xcite .",
    "the shape of the pir background temperature dependence in fig .",
    "3 is therefore consistent with the temperature dependence of the derivative @xmath57 which has a peak just below @xmath35 and is very close to zero or my be even negative above @xmath35 .    to estimate",
    "the maximum magnitude of the bolometrically induced reflectivity change we take the available data for nd@xmath58sr@xmath44mno@xmath1@xcite where the reflectivity drop below @xmath35 is @xmath59 in the temperature range of @xmath60 . a similar reflectivity drop is expected in nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 judging from a similar temperature dependence of the optical conductivity.@xcite taking into account the estimated 0.5k temperature oscillation amplitude@xcite we obtain @xmath61 for the maximum in - phase bolometrically induced reflectivity change .",
    "this is in a fair agreement with the observed maximum amplitude of the pir background which is @xmath62 . the pir background amplitude and its temperature dependence are therefore consistent with a bolometric response .",
    "further , the temperature independent phase shift of @xmath22 between harmonically modulated average laser intensity and the surface temperature oscillation observed at 200 khz in our experiment is a characteristic of a 1d diffusion process.@xcite in our case the heat diffusion length on a timescale of the lock - in modulation frequency is a few @xmath3 m as estimated from typical heat capacity and thermal conductivity data for manganites@xcite and the substrate . since the laser beam diameter of 60@xmath3 m is much larger than the heat diffusion length at the modulating frequency the heat diffusion is indeed expected to be effectively 1d , further supporting the bolometric origin of the background pir in the manganites .    a similar @xmath22 temperature independent phase shift observed in ( la , pb)mno@xmath1@xcite suggests the bolometric origin of the pir background in that case as well .",
    "we measured temperature dependence of ultrafast photoinduced reflectivity transients in nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 thin film . on the sub - ps timescale",
    "the transients are only weakly sensitive to the metal - insulator transition at @xmath19@xmath63 k , but instead show a remarkable change in shape below @xmath2 k. major changes in the shape are correlated with an anomaly observed in the magnetization temperature dependence , but no anomaly is observed in the temperature dependence of the resistivity in this temperature range .",
    "the absence of the anomaly in resistivity is attributed to the substrate - film lattice - mismatch induced inhomogeneity of the film .",
    "the changes of the transients could be attributed to an additional sub-100-fs relaxation component , which originates from the most strained layer of the film near the substrate .",
    "although the substrate undergoes a structural phase transition in the same temperature range , the small changes of the substrate lattice parameters below the phase transition and the higher onset - temperature of the changes in the transients suggest that the observed anomalies are not due to the substrate but are related to the co instability of bulk nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "the slower 10 - 100-ps photoinduced - reflectivity relaxation dynamics is sensitive only to the @xmath19@xmath63-k mit exhibiting peaks in relaxation time and amplitude just below the mit temperature , similar as in some previously studied manganites with different doping .",
    "@xcite    on even slower timescales the photoinduced reflectivity is also sensitive to the @xmath19@xmath63-k mit only .",
    "while the ultra - slow - response temperature dependence on the @xmath3s timescale is consistent with the expected bolometric response , the relaxation on the 1 - 10-ns timescale shows a different temperature dependence and is most probably not bolometric .",
    "this indicates that the thermal equilibrium between different degrees of freedom ( charge , spin ) is not reached faster than on the nanosecond timescale .",

    "since the thicknes of the film is much smaller than the heat diffusion length on the @xmath3s timescale , the heat diffussion out of the experimental volume is governed by the heat diffusivity in the film and in the substrate and the thermal resistance of the boundary beetwen the film and the substrate . for purpose of estimation",
    "we neglect the boundary heat resistivity , assume a negligible film thickness and calculate the surface temperature oscilation amplitude and phase in a simple model assuming a semi - infinite homogenous material using the substrate thermal constants and the thin film optical constants .",

    "<S> k the sub - ps response displays a two component behavior indicating inhomogeneity of the film resulting from the substrate induced strain . on the other hand , the slower response on the 10 - 100 ps timescale is sensitive only to the metal - insulator phase transition and is in agreement with some previously published results . the difference in the temperature dependences of the responses on nanosecond and @xmath3s timescales indicates that thermal equilibrium between the different degrees of fredom is established relatively slowly - on a nanosecond timescale . </S>"
