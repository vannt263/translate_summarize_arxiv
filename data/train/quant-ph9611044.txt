    "emergence of classical properties through interaction with the environment has been the subject of extensive studies . in this context , a study of simple open quantum systems can provide a clue to understanding the mechanism of the quantum - classical transition . in this paper",
    "we wish to study one of the simplest nonlinear quantum systems - the anharmonic oscillator .",
    "this system , when it is damped and driven , exhibits different behaviour in the steady state when described either quantum mechanically or classically with the later showing bistability  @xcite . in order to describe the emergence of classicality",
    ", such differences have to be clarified and the two results reconciled .",
    "the anharmonic oscillator is of particular interest for several reasons .",
    "first , its simplicity allows any complexity related to the model to be avoided .",
    "second , it is the archetypical model for dealing with nonlinearities in quantum mechanics and has been widely used to describe a great variety of systems . in particular ,",
    "it was introduced by drummond and walls  @xcite to describe dispersive optical bistability and more recently has been used by bortman and ron  @xcite to study the relativistic motion of a resonantly driven electron in a penning trap .",
    "drummond and walls  @xcite derived the exact steady state expectations values of the photon distribution function hence showing that in the quantum regime this model does not exhibit bistability or hysteresis .",
    "one would expect the classical or quantum results to be recovered in the appropriate limit .",
    "for instance , the level of excitation , @xmath0 , has been used to define such a limit  @xcite . for low excitation number",
    "the quantum result should apply while for high excitation number the classical result is expected to give the correct behavior .",
    "this description is reasonable but it does not demonstrate how the transition from classical to quantum occurs when the excitation number takes an intermediate value and whether the system suddenly becomes bistable or whether the bistability appears smoothly .",
    "drummond and walls  @xcite state that the extent to which bistability is observed will depend on the quantum fluctuations , which in turn determine the time for random switching between the two stable states . in this case",
    "the classical - quantum transition is of a statistical nature and the classical result appears in the limit where the switching time can be considered very large compared to an observational time .",
    "bortman and ron  @xcite presented a quantum - mechanical description of a _ single atomic system _ which is accessible to experiment  @xcite .",
    "they also state that if one does not deal with the effect of fluctuations upon the two stable states , that is , its influence upon the time scale of the stability , bistability is not destroyed by quantum fluctuations and should be observed even in the case of a low level of excitation . according to this description",
    "the system is bistable in both regimes and the observation of bistability thus depends on the experimental set up , with no fundamental restriction on its observation .",
    "motivated by these controversial points of view of drummond and walls  @xcite and bortman and ron  @xcite in this paper the quantum - classical transition of the driven damped anharmonic oscillator is investigated with the help of the quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) method . in the context of typical quantum optical problems , for example , the qsd method describes the continuous monitoring of the state of a photon source by individual photoelectric detection processes which involve heterodyning with a classical intense photon source @xcite .",
    "however , the qsd method has also been proposed as a phenomenological theoretical description of arbitrary individual quantum measurement processes @xcite .",
    "it has already been demonstrated that the qsd method , considered as a dynamical theory for _ single quantum systems _ , is a valuable tool in the understanding of the emergence of classical chaos in open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "thus it is expected that it will also be useful in obtaining new insights into the connection between classical and quantal behaviour of the driven damped anharmonic oscillator coupled to a reservoir , a physical system whose classical dynamics does not exhibit chaos .",
    "this is of particular interest here as this quantum system does not exhibit hysteresis whereas the corresponding classical system does .",
    "it will be shown that qsd provides a mechanics for bistable motion in phase space which is consistent with the quantum mechanical steady state result that bistability does not appear for mean values over an ensemble .",
    "furthermore , qsd helps to understand the crucial role played by the physical time scales which characterize the approach to the classical equilibrium positions in phase space and the jumps between these two classically stable equilibrium positions due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the question is addressed as to what can be measured , in principle , in an experiment  @xcite on such a system and under what conditions such an experimental observation will yield bistability and hysteresis .",
    "finally the assertions of drummond - walls and bortman - ron are questioned in the light of qsd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ qsd ] , the qsd model is briefly depicted . in section [ ao ]",
    "the anharmonic oscillator model is presented , and a brief review of the classical and quantum results related to bistability in the steady state is provided .",
    "section [ outlook ] describes the anharmonic oscillator from the point of view of qsd .",
    "finally , section [ conclu ] presents a discussion of the results and our conclusions .",
    "open quantum systems are represented by the density operator @xmath1 which evolves in time according to a master equation .",
    "the most general master equation in the markov approximation , which preserves trace and positivity of the density operator @xmath1 can be written in the lindblad form  @xcite @xmath2+\\sum_j\\left(l_j\\rho l_j^\\dagger - \\half l_j^\\dagger l_j\\rho - \\half\\rho l_j^\\dagger l_j \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian and @xmath4 are lindblad operators which represent the effects of the environment on the system .",
    "the quantum state diffusion model ( qsd ) represents one of the several possible unravellings of the master equation . according to the qsd model  @xcite",
    ", open quantum systems are represented by pure states @xmath5 , which describe individual systems .",
    "evolution of the state @xmath5 is given by a langevin - it differential equation @xmath6 the @xmath7 are random differential variables representing independent complex wiener processes .",
    "they satisfy the following mean relationships @xmath8 @xmath9 represents a mean over an ensemble and @xmath10 the quantum expectation of the operator @xmath4 in the pure state @xmath5 .",
    "the qsd trajectories are compatible with the master equation in the sense that the ensemble average of the projector @xmath11 reproduces the density operator @xmath1 : @xmath12 thus , expectations values @xmath13 of an operator @xmath14 can be computed as the ensemble mean of the quantum expectations values @xmath15 of the pure state @xmath5 .",
    "we consider a driven anharmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal bath  @xcite , the temperature of which is set to zero @xmath16 as the prototype model showing bistability in the classical domain .",
    "the damping of this oscillator with rate @xmath17 , is described by the lindblad operator @xmath18 .",
    "the hamiltonian in a frame rotating with the frequency @xmath19 of the driving field reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the annihilation and creation operators related to the position @xmath23 and momentum @xmath24 of the oscillator ( m is the mass of the particle ) .",
    "here the parameter @xmath25 measures the detuning between the eigenfrequency of the oscillator and the driving force .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 characterize the amplitude of the driving force the strength of the anharmonicity . in the following only positive values of @xmath27 will be considered .",
    "this hamiltonian whose corresponding classical dynamics is integrable is well known .",
    "it has been used to describe various physical phenomena such as dispersive optical bistability  @xcite , driven tunneling  @xcite and hysteresis in an atomic system  @xcite within the framework of the rotating wave approximation . in the context of optical bistability , for example , the qsd equation with hamiltonian ( 5 ) and @xmath18 describes the continuous monitoring of the electromagnetic field of frequency @xmath28 by individual photon detection processes which involve heterodyning with a classical intense photon source . without the adiabatic approximation ( i.e. for a time dependent driving @xmath26 ) this physical system has been discussed as a model which exhibits quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to describe more fundamental aspects like the effect of non linearities in master equations  @xcite , non - markovian approximations  @xcite , and more recently in a study of localization processes  @xcite",
    ". an appealing feature of this system is that exact quantum results exist for the correlations function  @xcite , the spectrum , and even the dynamics  @xcite in the absence of driving .",
    "the classical equivalent for this system exhibits hysteresis in the steady state  @xcite while the quantum system does not . in the next two sections well known results regarding the classical and quantum systems",
    "are presented in order to make this presentation self consistent .",
    "the classical equation of motion can be obtained  @xcite by factorizing the quantum correlation functions @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mean field amplitude @xmath32 in the ( semi- ) classical limit .    in the steady state regime , the excitation number @xmath33 can be obtained by solving the following equation @xmath34 once the excitation number @xmath33 is known the real and complex part of the mean amplitude @xmath31 can be derived using @xmath35 expression ( [ eqclassicnorm ] ) shows that the classical anharmonic oscillator can display one , two or three solutions depending on the choice of parameter values ( see figure  [ fighysteresdetuning ] ) .",
    "provided the following conditions are fulfilled @xmath36 ^ 2 & < & \\left [ 1- 3\\left ( \\frac{\\kappa/2}{\\domega+\\chi}\\right)^2\\right]^3 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then equation ( [ eqclassicnorm ] ) has three solutions . outside of this range , only one solution is expected .",
    "the first condition expresses the fact that the detuning has to be oriented in the right direction in order to combine its effect with that of the anharmonicity .",
    "the second shows that detuning and anharmonicity must be large enough in order to compensate dissipation , and the third condition gives limiting values for the driving strength .",
    "using the theory of linear stability  @xcite , it can be verified that when three solutions are present , one of them is always unstable . thus the domain of parameters is divided into two regions , one showing bistability and the other purely mono - stable behaviour ( see figure  [ fighysteresdomain ] ) . in short ,",
    "the classical model exhibits a bistable steady state when the parameters satisfy the above conditions leading to hysteresis .      using the complex @xmath24 representation , drummond and walls",
    "@xcite have solved the master equation for the density operator .",
    "they obtained an analytical expression for the moments @xmath37 in the steady state .",
    "notice that in this section , the brackets @xmath38 represent the ensemble mean of the quantum mechanical expectation values .",
    "their result reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gamma function and @xmath41 the generalized gauss hypergeometric series  @xcite : @xmath42 the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 depend on the physical parameters in the following way @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the mean excitation number is of particular interest here , it is given by @xmath47 using the properties of the hypergeometric series @xmath48 one can show that the quantum result is never bistable and thus does not show any hysteresis ( figure  [ fighysteresdetuning ] ) .",
    "in this section , the problem is tackled using the quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) model . according to qsd , the equation of motion for the mean field amplitude @xmath49 is @xmath50 dt -\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\ < a\\ > dt \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sqrt{\\kappa}(\\ < a^2\\ > - \\ < a\\>^2)d\\xi \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sqrt{\\kappa}(\\ < a^\\dagger a\\ > -\\",
    "< a^\\dagger\\>\\ < a\\>)d\\xi^\\ast .",
    "\\label{eqqsdevol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , the expectation values are taken in the pure state @xmath5 describing the evolution along a quantum trajectory .",
    "if one wants to describe the evolution of the mean value ( over an ensemble ) , one can take the mean on both sides of the equation ( [ eqqsdevol ] ) to obtain @xmath51 -\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\ < a\\>_\\rho\\ ] ] one can check easily that factorizing the quantum correlations in both of the two preceding equations leads to the classical equation of motion ( [ eqclasicalpha ] ) .",
    "thus , neglecting the quantum correlations corresponds to ignoring overlapping effects of the wave packet and quantum fluctuations .",
    "the parameters are chosen in the bistable domain .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the qsd equation ( [ eqqsdevol ] ) is computed numerically using the moving basis or mixed representation simulation method ( mqsd )  @xcite .",
    "the evolution is computed over a period of time of the order of @xmath52 , _ the dissipative time_. in this situation , the system evolves toward a different `` stationary '' state depending on the chosen initial state .",
    "the qsd evolution shows two different limit points where all the trajectories tend to go after some transient dissipative time .",
    "these two points are called equilibrium points .    when the trajectory starts far away from the two equilibrium points , it approaches one of them , depending in which basin of attraction it starts in , rotating with a frequency given by the detuning @xmath53 .",
    "if the wave packet is initially spread out , it tends to localize  @xcite to a coherent state during the dissipative transient . here",
    "the state is said to be localized if its spread is much smaller than the distance between the two equilibrium points .",
    "thus the quantum fluctuations have less and less effect .",
    "after the transient damped motion towards one of the equilibrium points , the wave packet remains localized .",
    "this strong localization property allows one to describe the quantum system in a quasi classical way .    as a consequence of the anharmonicity",
    ", the system does not however preserve the coherent states to which it is driven by the dissipative terms .",
    "hence , the quantum correlations never vanish , and the quantum fluctuations act on the wave packet whose center will fluctuate around it s equilibrium point .",
    "the dynamics are now dominated by quantum fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations have a mean frequency and an amplitude which depends on the position of the equilibrium point in phase space .",
    "the fluctuations are bigger for the equilibrium point situated further away from the origin .",
    "this is an effect due to dissipation , represented by @xmath18 , which produces a dynamical behaviour like @xmath54 clearly attracting the system towards the origin @xmath55 and not to some local minima .    at this point",
    "the qsd trajectories can be roughly seen as classical trajectories subjected to noise .",
    "there are two distinct equilibrium points leading to bistable behaviour similar to the classical one .",
    "we know that the qsd model reproduces the quantum result in mean over an ensemble but if qsd shows bistability , how can the quantum result be recovered ?",
    "the answer is that the evolution described above is stable over a very long time compared to the dissipative time , but if one integrates over a longer time , one sees that any trajectory goes from the neighborhood of one equilibrium point to the other .",
    "this transition happens in mean after a time called the _",
    "transition time _ or _ exit time _ , which can be much longer than the dissipative time .    in order to observe the transition between the two equilibrium points ,",
    "the parameters are chosen such that the maximal excitation number is set at an intermediate value between the classical and quantum limits .",
    "also , the integration is now carried over a long time , typically @xmath56 to @xmath57 times the dissipative time .",
    "the system is initially set in a coherent state centered far away from the two fixed points and evolved in time with qsd .",
    "figure  [ figqsdevolps ] represents a trajectory in phase space which shows the dissipative part of the trajectory , followed by a long period of fluctuations around the attracting equilibrium point .",
    "this first part of the time evolution of the trajectory , i.e. its approach to equilibrium , has been described in the previous section  [ dissipdyn ] .",
    "if the integration is carried on , the trajectory will suddenly jump to the neighbourhood of the other equilibrium point .",
    "( the `` jump '' described here is a diffusive process which allows the quantum trajectory to go from the basin of attraction of one equilibrium point to the other . )",
    "the system will remain around the second equilibrium point during some time and then come back to the first point .",
    "the time spent around each equilibrium point is such that the quantum expectation value @xmath58 is recovered in mean .",
    "due to quantum fluctuations induced by the coupling to the reservoir the equilibrium points become metastable .    this transition , which occurs in a time shorter than the dissipative time , might be viewed as a tunneling process .",
    "savage and cheng  @xcite have investigated whether bistability can be associated with quantum superpositions of states in either well .",
    "they have introduced a distinction between coherent and diffusive mechanisms for quantum tunneling . in our simulations ,",
    "the wave packet initially localized in one well becomes delocalized when it crosses the barrier , making the distinction between these two mechanisms of tunneling artificial ( see figure  [ figqsdevoljumptime ] ) .",
    "once the barrier is crossed , the wave packet localizes again .    to confirm the previous description , a mean over an ensemble",
    "is considered .",
    "figure  [ figqsdevolmeantime ] represents the time evolution of the mean position and mean momentum .",
    "the mean is computed over 100 trajectories .",
    "the system is initially placed in a coherent state centered at the classical equilibrium point .",
    "this point is unstable with respect to the other equilibrium point .",
    "the mean position and momentum evolve , roughly as an exponential decay , to the quantum stationary values given by the exact quantum result . for this typical example",
    ", the quantum result is very close to one of the equilibrium points , because the transition time from the initial to the final point is much shorter than in the opposite direction .",
    "hence , the mean result confirms that the initial equilibrium point is unstable compared to the other one as a consequence of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "this relative instability explains why the quantum description does not show bistability . according to qsd even in the quantum regime ,",
    "the system is bistable , but the bistability is hidden by the fluctuations which make the wave packet move from a fairly localized state in one well to a localized state in the other well .",
    "we have used qsd to describe the driven damped anharmonic oscillator in an intermediate regime between quantum and classical . it has been shown that states localize along a quantum trajectory and a transition between the two equilibrium points of the system has been observed .",
    "the localization gives a quantitative justification for the classical analogy in which a localized particle moves in a double well potential .",
    "this analogy has often been used on a purely qualitative level without any further justification .",
    "the transition between the two equilibrium points allows one to recover the quantum result and reconciles quantum and classical descriptions .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the following aspects :      the qsd model , by introducing quantum fluctuations in an explicit way , shows explicitly how classical bistability disappears .",
    "furthermore it introduces a new time scale , the transition time characteristic of the transition between the two ( classical ) equilibrium points .",
    "more precisely there are two transitions times , the transition time from one equilibrium point to the other and a different time associated with the reverse transition .",
    "because one of these transition times is in general much smaller than the other one , the transition considered here starts from the less stable equilibrium point which is located further away from the origin in phase space .    in a sequence of papers , vogel and risken  @xcite have calculated the transition rates by solving the equations of motion for quasidistribution functions using the matrix continued - fraction method .",
    "they also obtained analytical results for the transition rate in the limit of large excitation numbers and low damping .",
    "the rate of decay shown on the figure  [ figqsdevolmeantime ] is an approximation to the mean transition rate between the two equilibrium points .",
    "the time needed for the decay is clearly much larger than the dissipative time .",
    "thus qsd not only gives a qualitative description but can also be used easily to obtain numerical estimates of the relevant transition times .",
    "we will not address any further the question of the determination of the transition time in this paper as one can use the accurate results of vogel and risken which confirm the possibility of very large transition times compared to the dissipative time .",
    "let us consider the following ideal experiment : ( see @xcite for a practical realization ) in order to see hysteresis a single quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator is measured continuously under conditions in which its classical counterpart would be bistable .",
    "let us assume that the driving frequency @xmath19 is varied step by step from low to high frequencies and reversed , spanning twice the classically bistable domain .",
    "once the frequency is modified , the experimenter waits a time , called _ the measurement delay _ @xmath59 , which is assumed to be much longer than the dissipative time , before doing any further measurement .",
    "the excitation number of the oscillator is measured before changing the frequency of the driving force again .",
    "thus this type of resonance experiment corresponds to an adiabatic sweeping of the frequency with respect to the `` fast '' dissipative dynamics .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that this continuous measurement is ideal in the sense that the excitation number of the harmonic oscillator can be measured nondestructively and that it does not perturb the systems transition rates , i.e. it is a nondemolition measurement .",
    "such a measurement can be performed , for example , in an optically bistable system by monitoring the state of the field mode by heterodyning with an intense classical photon source .",
    "alternatively , this measurement can also be realized by observing the relativistic motion of a resonantly driven electron in a penning trap , like in the recently performed experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite . according to qsd such",
    "a measurement should reproduce the curve depicted in figure  [ figqsdidealexperiment ] showing hysteresis .",
    "the experimenter should obtain such a curve fluctuating around one of the two classical steady state values for a while and then jumping to the other value .",
    "the combination of the two jumps occurring when the driving frequency is ramped from low to high frequencies and reversed allows one to define the detuning width @xmath60 as the size of the bistable region .",
    "figure  [ figqsdidealexperiment ] represents such a result and shows the detuning width @xmath60 for this particular realization .",
    "the detuning width is different for each realization of this experiment , the transition being a stochastic event .",
    "an experiment carried out in the classical limit does not show any fluctuations and the two jumps occur always at the same detuning value . in this case",
    "the detuning width @xmath60 corresponds to the full size of the bistable region .",
    "if one uses the density matrix to describe such an ideal experiment , the result will also show two distinct transitions .",
    "the mean detuning width depends not only on the characteristic physical parameters of the driven damped anharmonic oscillator but also on the measurement delay @xmath59 .",
    "if the mean transition time @xmath61 is much larger than the dissipative time , i.e. @xmath62 , one can distinguish between the two limiting cases : ( 1 ) if the measurement delay is small relative to the transition time , i.e. @xmath63 , then the mean detuning width @xmath60 has a finite value , showing bistability . ( 2 ) at the opposite extreme , i.e. for @xmath64 , the detuning width is equal to zero , showing no hysteresis at all , in agreement with the quantum steady state result .",
    "the classical limit is valid for high excitation number . in this limit",
    "the mean transition time is so large and the transition between the two equilibrium points so infrequent that they can be neglected . in this limit any finite observational time",
    "satisfies the conditions for the experimental observation of hysteresis .",
    "when the excitation number decreases sufficiently for the mean transition time to take a very large but accessible value , one has to distinguish between the cases where the measurement delay is smaller or larger than the transition time .",
    "the classical description is still valid in the former case but does not apply anymore in the latter .",
    "the fluctuations have to be taken into account for a correct description of this situation .",
    "if we continue lowering the excitation number , still keeping the mean transition time large compared to the dissipative relaxation time , then the classical theory no longer gives a good description of the dynamics since even for a measurement delay much smaller than the transition time it predicts a fixed detuning width .",
    "if one uses quantum theory , which includes the fluctuations , one will be able to obtain the correct behaviour .",
    "finally when the excitation number is small , the classical theory is no longer valid .",
    "one has to use the quantum theory and specify the measurement delay in order to describe correctly the result of an experiment .",
    "the bistability is not destroyed in any of these cases but it is simply hidden by the quantum fluctuations .",
    "this situation is very similar to that of a classical driven anharmonic oscillator coupled with a thermal bath with non - zero temperature . introducing thermal fluctuations",
    "also hides the bistability of the steady state and introduces a classical transition time ( see @xcite ) . in order to observe bistability",
    ", one has to introduce a measurement delay much larger than the relaxation time in the absence of thermal fluctuations , but shorter than the mean transition time .",
    "the thermal fluctuation can be neglected only when the transitions take place in a time much larger than the observational time .    in all the previous situations the quantum theory applies . because the density matrix automatically includes the mean over an ensemble",
    ", there is no clear distinction between the dissipative dynamics and the dynamics induced by the fluctuations .",
    "qsd , by unraveling the different quantum trajectories , helps one to understand the role played by the statistical mean .",
    "we have shown that qsd leads to quantum trajectories which exhibit bistability for the driven damped anharmonic oscillator and that the quantum steady state result is recovered through random switching between the two equilibrium points due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations also introduce a characteristic time scale : the mean transition time .",
    "we have also shown that it is still possible to observe bistability dynamically in this quantum system by introducing a measurement delay @xmath59 .",
    "an experiment will show hysteresis only if the transition time between the ( classical ) equilibrium points , @xmath61 , is much larger than all other relaxation times involved ( approximately @xmath52 ) .",
    "if the transition time is not that large , it is not possible to observe any hysteresis effects and the quantum steady state solution is expected .",
    "furthermore , provided the transition time is much larger than the other times , hysteresis can be seen only if a measurement delay is such that @xmath65 .",
    "thus , within this interpretation the classical result is valid only if the quantum fluctuations are so small that they induce a transition time very large compared to the period of observation .",
    "our results confirm the statistical description given by drummond and walls .",
    "the results of bortman and ron have to be examined more carefully . strictly speaking , even for low excitation number , the bistability is not destroyed , it is just hidden by the quantum fluctuations .",
    "but one can not neglect the effect of the fluctuations upon the two stable states since it is exactly these fluctuations which prevent an experimental observation of hysteresis in the steady state .",
    "finally , if qsd is used to describe the dynamical behaviour of a single quantum system our investigations might be of particular relevance for experiments on optical bistability or for the recently performed experiments of gabrielse et al .",
