    "actually the anisotropy value defined from a fluorescence process in the previous section represents the anisotropy well below the ase threshold , whenever spontaneous emission is dominant over stimulated emission .",

    "furthermore , even in the absence of cavity , photons propagate within specific electromagnetic modes , which also tends to enhance @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , in order to get a more comprehensive interpretation , an analysis of the modes must be performed .",

    "is measured in the far - field and is thus purely polarized along the @xmath33 direction ( i.e. no @xmath35 component ) .",

    "the bulk refractive index of pmma is 1.49 at 600 nm and increased slightly with the addition of a dye , for instance @xmath36 for 5@xmath6 wt dcm in pmma .",
    "assuming an infinite silica layer , then there exists a single mode for each polarization ( one te and one tm ) propagating inside the doped pmma layer , both with close effective refractive index , @xmath37 .",
    "however the tiny differences are enhanced by the non - linearity of stimulated emission .",
    "firstly , the effective index of te is slightly higher than that of tm ( @xmath38 ) , which means that the te mode is more localized inside the gain layer @xcite and thus more amplified .",
    "secondly , the silica layer is finite .",
    "losses through the silicon layer are then altering mostly tm mode , which is less confined into the pmma propagating layer .",
    "these arguments show that mode considerations ( without molecular influence ) can explain the discrepancy between both components .",

    "both @xmath0 are higher than 0.5 , which is the maximal value expected for an ensemble of isotropically fluorescent dipoles , for any @xmath21 . in the general case of an arbitrary shape of resonator , the effective index approximation fails at the boundary ( since the layers are not infinite ) @xcite , and the measure of @xmath0 may provide an insight into the electromagnetic modes which co - exist within the cavity as will be considered in the next section .",
    "the resonator modifies the degree of polarization in two different ways .",
    "it creates a feedback which enhances further the dominant component ( i.e. @xmath8 ) .",
    "but at the same time , for in - plane micro - cavities , reflections at the boundary couple components of the electromagnetic field and lead to a partial redistribution of the energy .",
    "+ the simplest case to consider is the fabry - perot cavity ( i.e. the classical two - mirrors cavity ) , in which polarization states have been extensively studied with liquid dye lasers ( see for instance @xcite ) , but more rarely in the solid - state @xcite .",
    "+      in vecsol configuration with a rh640-pmma layer , the degree of polarization @xmath0 equals to unity for a linearly polarized pump beam , which means that the lasing emission is totally polarized , like the pump .",
    "moreover when the pump beam is circularly polarized , the lasing emission is not polarized , which means that there is no noticeable difference between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 components , and a quarter waveplate added on the beam path does not allow to recover a preferential polarization direction .",

    "the transfer of excitation via alq@xmath67 is then an efficient method to increase the participation of @xmath9 .",

    "the @xmath0 values are summarized in tab.i .",

    "the absorption dipoles for s@xmath3s@xmath4 and s@xmath3s@xmath5 of dcm , pm605 , and md7 were calculated with gaussian@xmath22 software and reported in fig.[fig : dipole ] .",

    "the results for a dcm - pmma layer are plotted with circles in fig.[fig : vecsol ] .",
    "contrary to the case of 532 nm pumping , under a high 355 nm pumping , the laser emission is now almost insensitive to the pump polarization , which corresponds to @xmath75 . besides , we performed time resolved measurements of fluorescence anisotropy @xcite and got @xmath76 under a 355 nm pumping , even at very short delay after excitation .",
    "this effect could be assigned to different absorbing transitions , or maybe to ret occurring during the s@xmath68 to s@xmath4 non radiative transitions .",

    "results for dcm and pm605 are summarized in tab.i .",
    "however the cavities suffered from a considerable bleaching , whereas it was not even an issue under the s@xmath3s@xmath4 pumping . for reliable results , we then used a home - made laser dye , called md7 @xcite , which molecular structure and absorption dipole moments are presented in fig.[fig : dipole ] .",
    "the degree of polarization @xmath0 was plotted in fig.[fig : p - formes ] for various cavity shapes and shows indeed considerably lower values than under 532 nm pumping .",
    "an important point is that @xmath0 is still positive for ase , while it is clearly negative for diamond modes in square micro - laser , and for wgm in kite micro - laser .",
    "so , although te polarization is favored due to gain material and/or propagation , the coupling to tm modes within the resonator is strong enough to reverse the balance in favor of @xmath9 . + to summarize , with a robust laser dye , pumping into high excited states is indeed an appropriate way to get a lasing polarization which is not strictly constrained by the pump polarization and pump geometry .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the polarization states of organic solid - state lasers in two different configurations , vecsol and in - plane micro - resonators .",
    "the framework of fluorescence anisotropy was used to interpret the data and showed that pump geometry favors a specific component of the electric field : parallel to the pump polarization for vecsol and in - plane for micro - lasers . to release this constraint",
    ", we demonstrated that pumping into higher excited states of the laser dye can modify significantly the ratio between the polarized components of the emitted field .",
    "these experiments were used to explore the influence of the resonator shape on the polarization states . for fabry - perot cavities ,",
    "thanks to the feedback , there is an enhancement of the dominant polarization compared to amplified spontaneous emission . on the contrary , for resonances with long photon lifetimes , like wgm , the polarization states can be strongly modified by coupling of the electromagnetic components at the cavity boundary .",
    "this opens the way to a more systematic investigation of the relationship between mode structure and resonator shape , by combining experimental set - up @xcite and numerical simulations which should be both able to capture the three dimensional nature of the electromagnetic field .",

    "the absorption transition dipole from the fundamental state @xmath77 to an excited state @xmath78 is defined as the following vector ( see p.434 of ref.@xcite ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the stationary wavefunctions of the involved states , and @xmath82 is a vector operator that is the sum of the position vectors of all charged particles weighted with their charge .",
    "absorption is a fast process ; the positions of the nucleus are thus assumed to be fixed , and only the electronic part of the wavefunctions changes between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "laser dyes are often plane aromatic molecules and the s@xmath3s@xmath4 transition corresponds to the transfer of a single electron from a @xmath23 to a @xmath83 orbital .",
    "these orbitals are both symmetrical above and below the plane of the molecule , and so the integral ( [ eq : dipole - abs ] ) along the direction perpendicular to this plane is zero , since the global function to integrate is odd . hence @xmath84 lies in the plane of the molecule .",
    "if the dye is pumped in its s@xmath5 state , the excited wavefunction involves in general a @xmath83 orbital as well , and @xmath70 remains in the plane of the molecule .",

    "+ the definition of the emission transition dipole is similar to ( [ eq : dipole - abs ] ) , except the expression of @xmath81 .",
    "usually the molecule relaxes before emitting and the wavefunction of the excited state should then take into account the vibrations of the nucleus .",
    "strictly speaking , the emission dipole is hence different from the absorption dipole of the same transition .",
    "however the rearrangement in the s@xmath4 state is in general not very huge and the angle @xmath21 between the dipoles @xmath16 and @xmath17 remains close to zero .",
