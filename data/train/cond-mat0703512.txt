    "<S> we have measured magnetization @xmath0 , electrical resistivity @xmath1 , thermal conductivity @xmath2 , and thermopower @xmath3 of polycrystalline samples of nd@xmath4eu@xmath5nio@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) as a function of temperature and external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the data indicate a metal - insulator ( mi ) transition in a wide range of temperature ( @xmath8 k ) . the magnetic susceptibility @xmath9 data , after the subtraction of the rare - earth contribution , exhibit a curie - weiss like behavior at temperatures above @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> although a clear antiferromagnetic af transition of the ni sublattice is observed at @xmath11 , @xmath9 still increases down to 5 k , suggesting a heterogeneous ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity of the ndnio@xmath6 compound is not affected by an external magnetic field of 90 koe in a wide range of temperature , and its temperature dependence below 15 k is approximately quadratic , strongly suggesting the presence of disorder . the data also show that @xmath12 is negative above @xmath10 and varies linearly with temperature , as expected in a typical metal with negative charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath10 , @xmath12 does not follow the expected behavior of insulating compounds . </S>",
    "<S> there is a minimum close to 120 k , and @xmath12 changes its sign at @xmath13 k , indicating a competition between two types of charge carriers . a pronounced peak in @xmath12 at @xmath14 k does not follow the expected phonon - drag temperature dependence either above or below @xmath15 and the peak remains unaltered under magnetic fields up to 90 koe . however , its magnitude is enhanced by @xmath16% with applied magnetic field , exhibiting a clear magnetothermopower effect . </S>",
    "<S> the combined results indicate a coexistence of ordered and disordered phases below @xmath17 and that an applied magnetic field is suitable for enhancing the thermoelectric properties of these perovskites close to @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> transition metal oxides _ _ r__nio@xmath18 ( _ r _ = rare earth , _ r _ @xmath19 la ) are interesting due to their transport and magnetic properties caused by strong electronic correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> these perovskites show a marked metal - insulator ( mi ) transition at a temperature @xmath10 which increases when the ionic radius of the rare earth decreases , ranging from @xmath20 k for _ r _ = nd to @xmath21 500 k for _ r _ = eu . </S>",
    "<S> they also show an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase transition at a temperature @xmath17 related to the ordering of the ni sublattice . for _ r _ = nd , @xmath22k , and for _ r _ = eu , @xmath23 k , well below @xmath10 [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) experiments performed in _ r _ = nd showed an unexpected propagation vector @xmath24 = ( 1/2 , 0 , 1/2 ) , probably related to an inhomogeneous ground state composed of alternating ferromagnetic and af couplings between nearest - neighbor ni@xmath25 along the three pseudocubic axes . </S>",
    "<S> this unusual af ordering has been attributed to the presence of an orbital ordering ( oo ) that would break down the inversion center at the ni site in the orthorhombic symmetry [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> other npd peaks were reported below @xmath26 k and associated with a magnetic ordering of the ni@xmath25 spins [ 3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> results in smaller rare earth ions ( _ r _ = ho , y , er , and lu ) also suggested a change in the crystal symmetry , from orthorhombic @xmath27 to monoclinic @xmath28 , across the @xmath10 transition , resulting in a charge disproportionation of ni@xmath25 cations [ 4 ] . electron diffraction and raman scattering experiments indicated a symmetry break also for _ r _ = nd [ 5 ] , and a direct observation of charge ordering ( co ) in epitaxial ndnio@xmath18 films , using resonant x - ray scattering , has also been reported [ 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these results led to the proposition that charge disproportionation , and a consequent change in the crystal symmetry , may occur below @xmath10 for all the members of the _ _ </S>",
    "<S> r__nio@xmath18 family , making the picture of oo obsolete [ 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> recent soft x - ray resonant scattering experiments indicated that oo is absent at the mi transition , that the complex af ordering previously proposed may not be correct , and that the magnetic structure is likely to be non - collinear [ 7 ] .    although some properties of these systems are well established , there are still many doubts regarding their low temperature ground state that seems to be inhomogeneous , dominated by the coexistence of at least two different phases </S>",
    "<S> . the data regarding the thermal properties as well as thermopower of these systems could be of interest to better understand their properties at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of systematic measurements of these properties is the main motivation for the development of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> polycrystalline samples of nd@xmath4eu@xmath5nio@xmath18 ( @xmath7 ) were prepared by using sol - gel precursors , sintered at high temperatures ( @xmath211000 @xmath29c ) , and under oxygen pressures up to 80 bar [ 8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were characterized by means of x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements in a brucker d8 advanced diffractometer using cu @xmath30 radiation ( @xmath31  ) . </S>",
    "<S> all samples were found to be single phase materials to xrd analysis [ 9 ] . </S>",
    "<S> magnetization @xmath32 measurements were taken in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer . </S>",
    "<S> the runs were performed cooling down and warming up the samples , with temperature ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 k and under dc magnetic fields as high as 10 koe . </S>",
    "<S> electrical resistivity @xmath35 measurements were performed by using the dc four - probe technique . </S>",
    "<S> thermopower @xmath12 and thermal conductivity @xmath36 were measured by using a physical propertie measurement system ( ppms ) equipment from quantum design . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath36 were also performed for the pristine compound ( _ r _ = nd ) in an applied magnetic field of 90 koe .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature @xmath10 was defined through the sharp peak observed in the curves of @xmath37 vs @xmath38 in the warming up cycle . for temperatures below @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> k , @xmath37 changes and increases faster . </S>",
    "<S> increasing eu content moves the mi transition to higher temperatures but preserves the behavior of @xmath37 vs @xmath38 at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> a pronounced thermal hysteresis is frequently observed close to the mi transition indicating the first - order character of the transition , as discussed elsewhere [ 9 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 data of ndnio@xmath18 indicate that an extra contribution to the ni sublattice must be considered below the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to study the nio@xmath40 sublattice is necessary to perform a precise subtraction of the contribution of the rare - earth ions from the measured @xmath9 signal . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of analysis has been done before , and indicated that the nio@xmath40 sublattice displays features of an unconventional antiferromagnet [ 9 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath9 still increases with decreasing temperature below @xmath17 , a behavior attributed to the existence of an inhomogeneous ground state comprised of alternating diamagnetic and paramagnetic sites [ 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior of @xmath9 has been observed in the eu substituted samples studied here [ 9 ] and may have their counterpart in thermal properties , as described below .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 data , measured under the warming process for several samples , are displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . a well defined jump in @xmath36 at high temperatures identifies the mi transition of the samples , that varies from @xmath21 195 to 295 k for samples with @xmath41 and 0.35 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , samples with @xmath42 and 0.35 exhibit a positive @xmath43 in the entire range of temperature whereas those with @xmath41 and @xmath44 display a negative @xmath43 in a small temperature range below @xmath10 . at temperatures close to @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> k the @xmath36 data display a change in their curvatures from upward to downward , as inferred from a combination of the data shown in fig . 1 and the inset </S>",
    "<S> .    [ htp ]   temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity @xmath36 for selected samples . </S>",
    "<S> the inset displays the low temperature data accompanied by the best fits obtained by using the relationship @xmath45.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ]    considering a simple model where the system is comprised of non - interacting particles , @xmath36 can be expressed by the sum of two contributions : a phononic @xmath46 and an electronic @xmath47 component . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 can be neglected ( insulating phase ) and @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the heat capacity , @xmath51 is the drift velocity , and @xmath52 is the mean free path of the thermal carriers [ 11 ] . since @xmath52 and @xmath51 are expected to be temperature independent in the low temperature regime , @xmath36 would follow the @xmath53 behavior , i. e. , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> attempts to fit the low temperature @xmath36 data to a @xmath55 function have failed , even when an extra linear term was considered . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the best fits were obtained by using @xmath45 , depicted in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , with values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 shown in table 1 . the factor @xmath56 follows a trend and decreases systematically with increasing eu content , whereas @xmath57 was found to be @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the function is essentially quadratic and the fits start to deviate from the experimental data when the temperature is increased above @xmath59 k. a @xmath60 term for @xmath36 is expected when phonons are scattered by electrons . </S>",
    "<S> however , this seems to be improbable here since these samples are insulating at low temperatures [ 8 , 9 ] . </S>",
    "<S> another possible origin for a @xmath60 term is due to the presence of itinerant magnetic excitations ( magnons ) , although this contribution would be effective only at very low temperatures [ 11 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> ccc @xmath61 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + & ( w / k@xmath62 m ) & + 0 & 0.00221 & 1.80 + 0.25 & 0.00143 & 1.83 + 0.30 & 0.00137 & 1.76 + 0.35 & 0.00051 & 1.88 +    the @xmath36 behavior strongly suggests the presence of disorder in the samples , since exponents similar to the ones found here are frequently observed in noncrystalline dielectric solids [ 12 ] . under these circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> the low temperature @xmath36 would be mainly governed by phonon - defect scattering , being proportional to @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of disorder in these nickelates has been proposed before and may to be related to the variable range hopping ( vrh ) mechanism observed in @xmath35 data at low temperatures [ 13 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> disorder can be an intrinsic property of the insulating phase of these compounds , as inferred from extended x - ray - absorption fine structure ( exafs ) in ndnio@xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that a co modulation only occurs in a short range scale , but the system remains disordered in long range scale [ 14 ] . within this scenario , the insulating state , below @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> is better described as composed of insulating co and jahn - teller distorted pockets . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of lowering temperature below @xmath10 favors the growth of the insulating pockets . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , the absolute values of @xmath36 are rather small at low temperatures ( @xmath63 w / km at @xmath64 k ) , indicating that phonons are strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior seems to be consistent with an inhomogeneous ground state due to cooperative bond - length fluctuations [ 15 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> some of the features described above were also observed in thermopower @xmath12 data , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> above @xmath10 , @xmath12 is negative and varies linearly with temperature , indicating negative charge carriers and a metal - like behavior , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath10 is reached , an abrupt change in @xmath12 takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the large thermal hysteresis when measurements are performed cooling down and warming up the samples . </S>",
    "<S> such a thermal hysteresis is suppressed in samples with eu content higher than @xmath65 ( not shown ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htp ]   temperature dependence of the thermopower obtained during warming the samples . </S>",
    "<S> the inset displays the thermal hysteresis observed at the mi transition for the sample with @xmath41,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the low temperature behavior of @xmath12 is much more complex and two different regions are of interest . in the range 40 k @xmath66 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is negative , reaches @xmath67 v / k ( for @xmath68 0 ) , and displays a well defined minimum at a given temperature @xmath69 k. similar minimum has been observed in ndnio@xmath18 at @xmath70 k , below which @xmath12 approached zero [ 16 ] . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior is not expected in insulators , where @xmath12 would diverge as temperature is lowered . below @xmath71 , @xmath12 decreases and becomes positive at @xmath21 40 k.    in the range @xmath72 k , @xmath12 is positive , indicating positive charge carriers , shows a sharp , large , and positive @xmath21 500 v / k peak at @xmath73 20 k. such a peak at @xmath15 has been found to be eu - independent and its shape does not follow the expected phonon - drag behavior , i. e. , @xmath55 for temperatures below the peak and @xmath74 for temperatures above . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of @xmath12 depends on the eu - concentration , displaying a systematic decrease with increasing eu content .    in order to better understand the role of the magnetic degrees of freedom in the electronic properties of these compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the pristine sample was subjected to an external magnetic field of @xmath75 koe . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows the @xmath3 data for two different magnetic fields during the warming cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 data are magnetic field independent for @xmath76 k. in the low temperature region ( @xmath77 k ) , @xmath12 is enhanced by @xmath78 when a magnetic field of 90 koe is applied , although the temperature where the maximum occurs is also magnetic field independent .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htp ]   temperature dependence of the thermopower of ndnio@xmath18 compounds under two applied magnetic fields . </S>",

    "<S> 3 ) suggests a competition between two types of carriers and , consequently , an inhomogeneous ground state . </S>",
    "<S> such a ground state can be visualized as composed of at least two kinds of regions ( or pockets ) with different charge carriers and different properties under applied magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> as the shape of @xmath3 is essentially unchanged under application of magnetic fields , one of these regions is believed to be very sensitive to the magnetic field and its thermopower properties are largely enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention that the nature of the phase responsible for the large magnetothermopower observed here is certainly related to the complex magnetic behavior of the ni sublattice below @xmath17 and the magnetic ordering of the nd ions at low temperatures [ 5 - 7 ] . in any event , </S>",
