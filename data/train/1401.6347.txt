    "many molecules possess multiple conformers ( rotational structural isomers ) that interconvert with low energy barriers through hindered rotations about single covalent bonds .",
    "it is well known that different conformations can exhibit distinct chemical reactivities  @xcite . to gain a comprehensive understanding of the chemical behavior of molecules , it is thus necessary to investigate their conformer - specific chemistry . to this end ,",
    "individual molecular conformations need to be isolated and characterized .",
    "moreover , the capability to manipulate conformational distributions provides means to influence reactivities and products , adding to the repertoire of methods to control chemical processes .",
    "when studies of conformational effects are carried out at low temperatures in the gas phase , the thermal interconversion of conformations is suppressed . in recent years , significant progress toward the spectroscopic characterization of specific conformations has been achieved  @xcite .",
    "for instance , studies of photoinduced ground - state isomerization reactions mapped out interconversion pathways between conformations , i.e. , minima on the corrugated potential energy surfaces  @xcite . investigations of the conformational landscape of small molecules , e.g. , poly - aminoacids , helped to understand the folding motives in peptides  @xcite .",
    "unimolecular conformer - specific dynamics have been investigated in the photodissociation of cations of small organic molecules  @xcite . in these studies , individual conformers of cations",
    "were selectively generated capitalizing on the different ionization energies of their parent neutrals .",
    "in addition , photodissociation studies on neutral conformers of small organic molecules have been carried out  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "individual conformers were not separated prior to photoexcitation .",

    "while all conformers of a molecule have the same mass , they often differ by their dipole moments .",
    "different dipole moments lead to different stark shifts of rotational energy levels in electric fields .",
    "thus , in an inhomogeneous electric field different forces act on the different conformers , which can be used for the manipulation of their translational motion .",
