    "the other four excited states show the similar values between two nuclei in figs .",
    "[ fig : sfac0 ] and [ fig : sfac2 ] . in those excited states ,",
    "either of the components of @xmath45 and @xmath4 of @xmath117 nuclei is selectively mixed .",
    "these results indicate that the breaking of the mirror symmetry is occurred only in their ground states .",
    "the reason of the difference in the @xmath4 coupling is that the @xmath0b ground state is located closely to the @xmath3be(@xmath105 ) state by 0.45 mev for resonance energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b7 ] , where the decay widths of two states are rather small in comparison with other resonances .",
    "this situation is not occurred in @xmath0he as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : he7 ] , in which the energy difference between @xmath0he(@xmath106 ) and @xmath3he(@xmath105 ) is 1.46 mev . the small energy difference between @xmath0b and @xmath3be(@xmath105 ) enhances the @xmath3be(@xmath105)-@xmath2 component in @xmath0b as the coupling to the open channel of the @xmath3be(@xmath105)+@xmath2 threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath3be(@xmath104)-@xmath2 component in @xmath0b becomes smaller than that of @xmath0he by 24 % as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfac0 ] , because the energy difference between the ground states of @xmath0b and @xmath3be is 1.97 mev , larger than the case of @xmath0he of 0.40 mev .",
    "the origin of the difference of the @xmath6-factors in @xmath0b and @xmath0he is the coulomb repulsion , which acts to shift the entire energies of the @xmath0b states up .",
    "the well - known effect of the coulomb interaction to break the mirror symmetry is the thomas - erhman shift , in which the @xmath121-wave dominant states suffer the different effect of coulomb repulsion from the states having mainly other partial waves .",
    "on the other hand , the present result found in the @xmath0b ground state is caused by the existence of the several open channels including the excitations of subsystems and is different from the thomas - erhman shift .",
    "as conclusion , the mirror symmetry is broken only in the ground states of @xmath0b and @xmath0he , while the excited states of two nuclei keep the symmetry .",
    "this result is associated with the energies of the @xmath117 subsystem as the open channels of the one nucleon emission .",
    "it is experimentally desired to observe the @xmath4 components of @xmath117 nuclei in @xmath0b and @xmath0he and examine the mirror symmetry . in the present analysis ,",
    "the @xmath6-factors represent the contributions of only the resonances of @xmath0b and @xmath3be . by considering the additional contributions of the remaining continuum states of two nuclei , it is available to obtain the strength functions of the one - proton removal from @xmath0b into @xmath3be and also into the @xmath1he+@xmath2+@xmath2 final states , which are observable .",
    "it is interesting to obtain these strengths and compare them with the one - neutron removal strength from @xmath0he into @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the resonance structures of @xmath0b with the @xmath1he+@xmath10 four - body cluster model .",
    "the boundary condition for many - body resonances is accurately treated using the complex scaling method .",
    "the decay thresholds concerned with subsystems are described consistently .",
    "we have found five resonances of @xmath0b , which are dominantly described by the @xmath2-shell configurations .",
    "the energy and the decay width of the ground state agree with the recent experiment .",
    "we also predict four excited resonances of @xmath0b , which are desired to be confirmed experimentally .",
    "we further investigate the spectroscopic factors of the @xmath3be-@xmath2 components in @xmath0b to examine the coupling behavior between @xmath3be and a last proton .",
    "it is found that the @xmath3be(@xmath105 ) state contributes largely in the ground and the several excited states of @xmath0b . in comparison with @xmath0he , the mirror nucleus of @xmath0b ,",
    "the @xmath3be(@xmath105)-@xmath2 component in the @xmath0b ground state is larger than the @xmath3he(@xmath105)-@xmath9 component in the @xmath0he ground state .",
    "this difference comes from the fact that the @xmath0b ground state is close to the @xmath3be(@xmath105 ) state in energy by the coulomb repulsion .",
    "this situation enhances the @xmath3be(@xmath105)-@xmath2 component in @xmath0b as the channel coupling .",
    "the different coupling of @xmath117 nuclei in @xmath0b and @xmath0he is occurred only in their ground states and indicates the breaking of the mirror symmetry .",
    "it is desired to observe the difference of the couplings in @xmath0b and @xmath0he experimentally .",
