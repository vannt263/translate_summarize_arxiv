    "most potential applications of graphene require to construct macroscopically large samples that are bound to be polycrystalline .",
    "several routes are currently actively pursued to obtain large samples in an efficient way .",
    "examples are evaporation of surface layers of sic @xcite , solution of graphite without functionalization , in combination with sonication @xcite to obtain graphene paper ( laminate ) and chemical vapor deposition on metals @xcite",
    ". studies of graphene grown by these methods confirm the existence of grain boundaries ( gb ) , as was observed in graphene on sic @xcite , ir(111 ) @xcite , polycrystalline ni @xcite and cu @xcite .",
    "although the presence of gb may be detrimental for electron mobility and mechanical strength , gb are potentially interesting by themselves , e.g. by metallicity along the grain as shown in ref .",
    "several theoretical papers have considered the structure @xcite and electronic @xcite properties of tilt gb in graphene .",
    "gb were subject of intensive experimental and theoretical study in the 70 s of last century . at that time",
    ", the basic principles of formation of gb structures were understood and the special class of gb characterized by high symmetry was identified by the coincidence site lattice ( csl ) approach @xcite .",
    "these gb have optimal matching of the grains and , being energetically the most favorable , are dominant in well annealed polycrystalline samples .",
    "most gb studied experimentally in graphene can indeed be classified as low energy structures within the csl theory @xcite .",
    "these gb consist of regularly arranged dipoles of disclinations with rotation angles @xmath0 associated with 5 and 7-fold carbon rings @xcite .",
    "the distance between disclination dipoles depends on the misalignment of the grains .",
    "the high strength characteristics of these gb in graphene @xcite confirms the strong bonding in the core of the 5 - 7 disclination dipoles .    in bulk materials , however , also",
    "less favorable gb with extrinsic structural defects , extra volume excess and large elastic strain have been observed depending on the treatment of polycrystalline samples @xcite .",
    "also for graphene , one may expect this situation for samples obtained by coalescence of independently growing nuclei as typical of chemical vapor deposition .",
    "the properties of more general gb have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , besides 5 - 7 pairs , there are 8-fold rings which dominate at tilt angle close to 15@xmath1 as well as 4- and 9-fold rings with less probability . beside having higher energy and excess free volume ,",
    "these gb may also present dangling bonds and resemble structures found in amorphous graphene obtained by electron bombardment @xcite .",
    "the possibility of dangling bonds makes these high energy gb particularly interesting since the dangling bonds can carry magnetic moments and are potential sources of magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "the possibility that grain boundaries can be a source of magnetism in graphitic materials was suggested in ref .",
    "based on the following experimental observations in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) .",
    "stm studies of gb with different periodicities found some peaks in the local density of states attributed to dangling bonds .",
    "depending on the periodicity of the gb , these additional peaks in the density of states were either situated at the fermi energy or split , which was interpreted as spin splitting .",
    "the room temperature ferromagnetism measured by magnetic force microscopy and bulk magnetization measurements was tentatively attributed to two - dimensional magnetic ordering at the grain boundaries .",
    "the observation of room temperature ferromagnetism was , however , not confirmed in other studies of hopg @xcite .",
    "recently , a systematic study of samples of hopg of different manufacturers @xcite has convincingly attributed the macroscopic magnetic signal found in some of them to fe - rich inclusions buried in the bulk .",
    "nevertheless , the local stm data of ref . could still be related to the existence of localized magnetic moments and the possibility to achieve ferromagnetism in @xmath2 electron materials remains very appealing @xcite and justifies further research .    in this paper , we study systematically the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of gb with dangling bonds ( dbgb ) in graphene by a hierarchical approach based on classical atomistic simulations and ab - initio calculations . as a result of a massive search based on simulated annealing by classical monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we find , that a particular structure with 5 , 8 and 7 rings ( 5 - 8 - 7 ) appears to be kinetically stable up to high temperature and can be a common structural element of generic gb in graphene . according to our dft calculations the 5 - 8 - 7 defect contains one dangling bond with an associated magnetic moment of @xmath3 with @xmath4 the bohr magneton ,",
    "that is only partially reduced by hydrogenation .",
    "this means that , in contrast to the low energy gb , a generic gb in graphene and graphite can have unpaired electrons and magnetic moments .",
    "note that , according to our calculations , the hydrogenation of dbgb turns out to be energetically favorable , thus , the most probably realistic dbgb in graphene should be passivated by hydrogen . at the same time , all qualitative conclusions about the structure and magnetism of gb do not depend on this assumption .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we present the methods for atomistic simulations and ab - initio calculations . in section [ sec : energetics ] we describe the structure and energetics of dbgb in graphene and in section [ sec : electronics ] we discuss their electronic structure and spin density . finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we give a summary and conclusions .",
    "a systematic study of gb is computationally demanding because it requires the examination of very large samples . therefore we have done a first search for dbgb by means of monte carlo simulations based on the classical lcbopii interatomic potential @xcite .",
    "after having identified the 5 - 8 - 7 structure as a promising basic unit for dbgb , we have studied the electronic and magnetic properties by means of spin polarized density functional theory ( dft ) calculations as implemented in the siesta code .",
    "the drawing of flat pictures was done using the xyz2eps utility @xcite written in python programming language @xcite .",
    "the visualization of 3d structures together with 3d charge density was done using the vesta visualization program @xcite .",
    "the classical bond - order potential lcbopii @xcite has been shown to describe accurately the structure @xcite and elastic properties @xcite of graphene as well as the phonons @xcite , the structure of the edges @xcite and bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this potential for dealing with gb has been validated against dft calculations in ref .",
    "for the present study , this potential has the important feature of being reactive , namely to allow breaking and formation of bonds as it would happen when grains meet .",
    "we have used monte carlo simulations in the npt ensemble , namely we have kept temperature t and number of particles n constant and allowed volume fluctuations as to keep the pressure p=0 . to find ( meta)stable structures we have done a simulated annealing lowering the temperatures from 3300k .",
    "the procedure to construct the samples is described in section [ sec : gbmodel ] .",
    "we have performed spin polarized dft @xcite calculations by means of the package siesta which implements dft on a localized basis set @xcite .",
    "we used gga with perdew - burke - ernzerhof parametrization ( gga - pbe ) @xcite and a standard built - in double-@xmath5 polarized ( dzp ) @xcite basis set to perform geometry relaxation of graphene samples with gb .",
    "the dzp basis set represents core electrons by norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials @xcite in the kleynman - bylander nonlocal form @xcite . for a carbon atom",
    "this basis set has 13 atomic orbitals : a double-@xmath5 for 2s and 2p valence orbitals and a single-@xmath5 set of five d orbitals .",
    "the cutoff radii of the atomic orbitals were obtained from an energy shift equal to 0.02 ry which gives a cut - off radius of 2.22    for s orbitals and 2.58    for p orbitals .",
    "the real - space grid is equivalent to a plane - wave cutoff energy of 400 ry , yielding @xmath6 0.08    resolution for the sampling of real space . for non periodical directions , an extra space larger than 15 ",
    "was added to avoid spurious interactions .",
    "we used k - point sampling of the brillouin zone based on the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite where the number of k - points was defined similarly to the k - grid cutoff radii equal to 15    which usually gives 4 - 20 k - points depending on the sample size .",
    "the geometries were relaxed using the conjugate gradient method until all interatomic forces were smaller than 0.04 ev /    and the total stress less than 0.0005 ev / @xmath7 .",
    "no geometrical constrains were applied during relaxation .",

    "the csl theory , however , includes only symmetric grain configurations and is not suitable to deal with generic gb , like the dbgb we study here .",
    "therefore we use a more general model , inspired by the theory of nanotubes @xcite and similar to that used in refs .   for symmetric gb .",
    "a nanotube is uniquely defined by a pair of integers @xmath10 relating the chirality vector @xmath8 to the basis vectors of the hexagonal lattice @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14    is the interatomic distance in graphene giving @xmath15 as lattice constant ( see fig . [",
    "fig : geomunitcell]a ) . for nanotubes ,",
    "the vector @xmath9 orthogonal to @xmath8 gives the nanotube axis and @xmath8 gives the direction of rolling . in terms of @xmath10 the vector @xmath9 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore we call @xmath21 and @xmath22 the positions of the two atoms in the unit cell of the hexagonal lattice . the case @xmath23 is illustrated in the unit cell shown in fig.[fig : geomunitcell]b .",
    "while for nanotubes the vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 are used to define a rectangle of given chirality to be rolled , for gb the chirality vector @xmath8 determines the direction of the grain boundary while the rectangular area is the graphene grain , as shown in fig.[fig : geomunitcell]a . in the csl approach",
    "the second grain is symmetric with respect to the gb direction given by @xmath8 .",
    "the length @xmath24 of @xmath8 in our basis is @xmath25 where @xmath26    there may be different pairs @xmath10 that give the same value of @xmath27 .",
    "for example @xmath28 may be obtained by pairs @xmath29 and @xmath30 so that , for @xmath28 , eq.[sigma ] has the 4 solutions @xmath31 .    the couples @xmath32 and @xmath33 are symmetric and are described by a single tilt angle in the csl theory whereas _",
    "e.g. _ the pair @xmath34 is not symmetric and requires to define the two misorientation angles of the two grains    @xmath35    in this way , by selecting two grains with the same @xmath27 we can satisfy periodic boundary conditions also for non symmetric grains selecting different chirality vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 together with the orthogonal vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this procedure allows to cut two rectangular grains with the same periodicity @xmath40 that , after proper reorientation , can be joined together to form the gb , labeled now by two pairs of indexes @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in case of symmetric grains",
    "i.e. @xmath43 and @xmath44 we can define @xmath45 .    since the two grains are rectangular , the final structure forms a rectangular unit cell which contains two grains with two gb .",
    "this construction gives us a starting point for the search of metastable non symmetric gb that we describe in the next section .      once the procedure for building gb considers also asymmetric grains , most situations will yield structures with large strain and atoms that are too close to each other , from 1.5    till 0.1    or even less .",
    "we have used two parameters to help the search for favorable structures .",
    "first , we introduce the parameter @xmath46 which controls the minimal distance between atoms .",
    "if two atoms are closer than @xmath46 then this pair is replaced by a single atom with average coordinates .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 influences the density of atoms along the grain boundary .",
    "we have searched with different values , namely @xmath47  .",
    "this procedure is physically justified because , in situation of crystal growth at high temperature , carbon atoms would be redistributed in such a way as to avoid too close overlap of the atomic cores .",
    "the other free parameter in our scheme is the shift @xmath48 of the sublattice vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath49 we use two values @xmath50 where @xmath51 puts the origin of the cell on one atom and @xmath52 gives the @xmath21 and @xmath22 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomunitcell ] .",
    "we use the freedom given by the procedure described above to construct thousands of initial configurations with gb . for each configuration , we optimize the structure by annealing the sample from 3300k by monte carlo simulations in the npt ensemble with the lcbopii interatomic potential . after a large number of monte carlo moves ,",
    "we find structures that do not evolve anymore and can be considered as metastable . among all these configurations we search automatically the ones with two - fold coordinated carbon atoms .    among these possibilities , the structure with 5 - 8 - 7 rings ( see fig .  [ fig:57 - 587-h587 ] )",
    "is the simplest and most common .",
    "therefore we have concentrated on this structure as prototype of dbgb .",
    "for simplicity , we have then constructed samples with 5 - 7 - 8 dbgb and different periods with symmetric grains defined by @xmath10 and @xmath53 .",
    "further relaxation of the selected structure with siesta affects the structure of graphene gb only marginally , which confirms the accuracy of our atomistic energy minimization .",
    "lastly we calculate electronic and magnetic properties with siesta .",
    "we have checked the stability of the 5 - 8 - 7 dbgb also by performing constant - temperature molecular dynamics ( md ) with nose thermostat using the dft package siesta at 3300k with a time step of 1 fs . the time dependence of temperature , energy and pressure are shown in fig .  [",

    "after 1000 md steps the structure of the 5 - 8 - 7 defect keeps its original geometry . during the dynamics , however , we observe an exchange of a 6-ring with a 7-ring that causes a mirror reflection of the 5 - 8 - 7 point defect with respect to the gb line . this transformation that keeps the original structure of the two - fold coordinated atom",

    "both long - range deformations extending over tens of thousands of atoms and specific atomistic and electronic structure of the cores are essential .",
    "therefore usually people study only special gb , mostly , those which can be constructed by the csl approach @xcite . these gb are , indeed , usually the most energetically favorable . at the same time , e.g. for cvd growth of graphene on metals @xcite , one could expect that various crystallites grow independently from many centers and more complicated gb will be formed .",

    "we have studied in detail gb containing the 5 - 8 - 7 defect which is the carrier of magnetic moment .",
    "based on the results presented here one can conclude that a generic gb should contain magnetic moments which are robust enough , in particular , with respect to hydrogenation .",
    "since gb in graphene are one - dimensional objects , they can not lead to magnetic ordering at any finite temperature .",
