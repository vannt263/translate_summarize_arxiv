    "the interpretation of gravitational microlensing results towards the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , ) has been hindered by the unknown location of the lensing systems .",
    "exceptions to this are caustic crossing binary lens events macho lmc-9 @xcite , where a sparsely resolved caustic crossing suggests an lmc lens , and macho 98-smc-1 ( ) , where a lens association with the smc is more certain . in this paper",
    "we present an additional `` exotic '' microlensing event seen towards the magellanic clouds , macho 96-lmc-2 .",
    "the lightcurve of macho 96-lmc-2 exhibits deviations from the standard microlensing fit similar to those that are expected if a binary source is lensed @xcite .",
    "this effect is the `` inverse '' of the parallax effect due to motion of the earth around the sun @xcite , and may be referred to as the `` xallarap '' effect , where the orbital motion occurs at the lensed source .",
    "detection of the xallarap modulation in a microlensing lightcurve allows us to fit the semi - major axis of the orbiting system in units of the lens projected einstein ring radius .",
    "an estimate of the physical semi - major axis of the system then allows a second constraint ( along with the event timescale @xmath12 ) on the 3 degenerate lens parameters mass , distance , and transverse velocity .",
    "describe the use of this effect in discriminating between galactic halo and lmc lenses .",
    "a detection of this type of modulation in a microlensing lightcurve is possible within a certain range of event parameters .",
    "first , the binary source should have an orbital period similar to or shorter than the event timescale , such that the sources accelerate appreciably during the time they are microlensed and an orbital period may be determined .",
    "second , the orbital separation of the sources should not be much smaller than the lens einstein ring radius projected to the source , otherwise the system appears to the lens as essentially a single object .",
    "this biases the detection of the xallarap effect towards events where the lens is close to the sources , analogous to the parallax effect , which is most easily detected when the lens is relatively close to the sun - earth system . a comprehensive review of microlensing with rotating binaries ( lenses , sources , and observers )",

    "there is no apparent excess in the @xmath63 diagram , suggesting this is an infrared excess .",
    "given the direction of the reddening vector in the @xmath64 , and @xmath25 passbands , this marginal excess can not be a feature of reddening .",
    "this could possibly be due to the lens itself , or in the context of model x1 , a signature of the dark companion to the primary .",
    "we also indicate in figure  [ fig - cmd ] the region 0.75 mag _ below _ the lensed object with an open circle , which would be the location of a single component of this object if it were a blend of equal brightness stars , as model x2 suggests .",

    "the original fits to model x1 yielded @xmath70 .",
    "in the case of @xmath71 , we are not able to fit model parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 individually , but can only constrain their product @xmath72 . therefore the fitting process was re  run , setting @xmath73 ( @xmath74 or @xmath75 imply non  existent secondaries ) and fitting for @xmath38 .",
    "therefore fit x1 has 1 more degree of freedom than x2 .",
    "the product @xmath72 was similar to that found in the original model .",
    "to explore the range of companions to the @xmath76 primary , we consider a `` light '' dwarf secondary of @xmath7 , henceforth fit x1a , and a `` heavy '' white dwarf or neutron star secondary of @xmath77 , fit x1b .",

    "the resulting parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 for fits x1a and x1b are also listed in table  [ tab - xalparams ] .    knowing the total mass of the system and orbital period allows us to solve for the physical keplerian parameters of the binary source .",
    "we find semi - major axes of 0.11 , 0.13 , and 0.23 au , and circular velocities of 132 , 154 , and 120 @xmath78 , for fits x1a , x1b , and x2 , respectively .",

    "this effectively leads to a measurement of the lens proper motion    @xmath80    to find the velocity of the lens projected to the lmc ( @xmath81 ) , we assume a lmc distance modulus of 18.5 , or a distance of 50 kpc .",
    "we further assume the source is 1 scale height behind the midplane of the lmc disk ( see below ) .",
    "the values of @xmath82 and @xmath81 for each of our fits are presented in table  [ tab - lens ] .",
    "the error bars on these values do not incorporate uncertainty in the distance to the lmc .    the proper motion measurement allows a one - parameter family of solutions relating the lens mass and distance    @xmath83    where @xmath35 is the ratio of lens to source distances , @xmath84 .    with some knowledge of the kinematics of sources and lenses , we can estimate a most likely distance for the lensing object , given our measured @xmath81 .",
    "this directly leads to an estimate of the lens mass from equation  ( [ eq - mlens ] ) .",
    "this is performed in a manner similar to and for each of the results from models x1a , x1b , and x2 .",
    "we use the following representation of the galactic - lmc system : the galactic halo is represented by model s of ; we use the preferred lmc disk model of , with a scale - height of 300 pc , tilt of 30  @xmath85 from face - on , central surface density of 190 @xmath86/pc@xmath87 , and we assume the source to be 1 scale height behind the midplane ; the solar velocity in galactic x , y , z is ( 9 , 231 , 16 ) @xmath78 ; the lmc velocity is ( 53 , -160 , 162 ) @xmath78 , with isotropic random velocities of 22 @xmath78 ( e.g. , ) in each direction . for the lmc halo ,",
    "we assume a similar profile to the galactic halo , with a central density of @xmath88 , core radius of @xmath89 , and velocity dispersion of @xmath90 .",
    "we truncate this halo at @xmath91 .",
    "we note the details of the galactic and lmc models do not qualitatively alter our conclusions .",
    "we find in each analysis that a lens residing in the lmc is preferred to a galactic halo lens , although only marginally so in fit x1b .",
    "in particular , for fit x1a the likelihood of measuring our value of @xmath92 is dominated by the lmc disk model . for this fit ,",
    "a lmc disk lens is 7 times more likely than a lmc halo lens , and @xmath93 times more likely than a galactic halo lens .",
    "we also point out that secondaries less massive than @xmath7 become increasingly unlikely , as decreasing the mass of the secondary leads to a lower lens @xmath81 . in this model , @xmath94",
    "already is drawn from the low velocity tail of the lmc disk probability distribution .",
    "as an example , a secondary of approximately jupiter mass would imply a lens velocity projected to the lmc of @xmath95 , clearly in contradiction to the lmc disk likelihood profile in figure  [ fig - like ] .",
    "for fit x1b , we find @xmath96 , which is most likely to come from our model of the lmc halo , although it is only 4 times as likely as a galactic halo lens . in this case , a lmc disk lens is ruled out at high confidence .",
    "we note that such a lmc halo population has yet to be detected directly .",
    "given the broad range in secondary mass , and hence the binary s semi - major axis , explored between fits x1a and x1b , we conclude this model favors a lens associated with the lmc . with our model x2 , we find @xmath97 , whose likelihood is strongly dominated by the lmc disk .",
    "figure  [ fig - like ] shows the probability distributions of @xmath81 for each component of our galactic - lmc model .",
    "our measured @xmath81 for each fit is also displayed with @xmath98 errors . only in model x1b",
    "does a galactic halo lens appear reasonable .",
    "our likelihood analysis also yields a probable distance to the lens , and from equation  ( [ eq - mlens ] ) , a mass .",
    "these parameters are listed in table  [ tab - lens ] for each model .",
    "model x1a allows the lightest lens mass , @xmath99 , while models x1b and x2 imply heavier lenses , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "we have referenced the low mass isochrones of to determine the expected brightness of a main sequence m - dwarf lens .",
    "we use the isochrones for @xmath102 , and an assumed lens age of 4 gyr .",
    "we find for objects of @xmath103 , and also for the upper @xmath98 confidence limit @xmath104 , absolute v magnitudes of 9.9 and 7.6 , respectively . at the distances implied by the likelihood analysis",
    ", even the most luminous configuration provides negligible flux from the lens compared to the apparent brightness of the source object .",
    "a @xmath105 lens at @xmath106 leads to an apparent lens magnitude of @xmath107 , or @xmath108 of the source brightness .",
    "the apparent i  band brightness of this lens is @xmath109 , or less than @xmath110 of the source brightness in this band .",
    "the secondary source is therefore a more likely origin for the possible i  band excess seen in figure  [ fig - cmd ] .",
    "the small lens proper motion of @xmath111 milli - arcsecond year@xmath112 implies it will take the next generation of space telescopes to be able to resolve and image the lensing object .",
    "we note that the lens location ( and therefore its mass ) can be more accurately determined with direct spectral observations of the source .",
    "in particular , the superposition of primary and secondary spectra can provide a discriminant between models x1 and x2 , and lead to a better mass estimate for each object .",
    "similarly , the orbital period can be precisely determined with radial velocity measurements .",
    "these observations will constrain the keplerian parameters more directly than our ( necessarily ) more complicated microlensing analysis has allowed .      in order to gauge the robustness of these conclusions , we have considered several alternate models , including placing the sources at larger distances behind the lmc , and increasing the amount of reddening to the sources .",
    "predicts a strong excess in lensed source reddening for models where the lmc is strongly self  lensing . in these models",
    ", the source stars must preferentially lie at the back side of the lmc , and thus will have high interstellar reddenings . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lenses are galactic dark matter , the reddenings of the source stars will be statistically the same as surrounding stars along the same lines of sight .",
    "use hst colors of 8 microlensed source stars to rule out , at the 85% confidence level , a model where all sources are located @xmath587 kpc behind the lmc disk .",
    "however , it is possible that roughly half of the sources may be in the background . therefore , we consider a model where the lensed sources are @xmath113 behind the lmc .",
    "this leads to an increase in source mass of @xmath114 , and results in projected velocities of @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath81 likelihood profiles for this source location differ significantly from those seen in figure  [ fig - like ] . most notably , the lmc disk and lmc halo profiles allow a similar range in @xmath81 , with the lmc halo generally preferred over the lmc disk , and median @xmath117 .",
    "for the lowest projected velocity ( model x1a ) , the lens is consistent with neither the lmc nor the galactic likelihood profiles .",
    "the lmc halo is the most likely location of the lens in all models , followed by the lmc disk in model x2 , and by the galactic halo in model x1b .",
    "it is also possible the reddening to the sources is larger than our adopted value of @xmath118 . for example , the foreground reddening maps of indicate @xmath119 , while finds typical lmc source star reddenings of @xmath120 .",
    "if we assume a higher reddening to the source object of @xmath119 , its intrinsic brightness and colors are @xmath121 . for model x1 ,",
    "the primary source would weigh @xmath122 , and for model x2 both sources would weigh @xmath123 . here",
    "we find @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , whose relative likelihoods can be evaluated using figure  [ fig - like ] .",
    "this change has more important implications for the source mass than for the projected velocities , and the likelihood results are similar to those from the standard analysis .",
    "we have measured and characterized a periodic modulation in the lightcurve of microlensing event macho 96-lmc-2 .",
    "we model this event using a single object microlensing a rotating binary source , which provides considerable improvement over a single source model .",
    "possible alternate explanations to this modulation include a single source lensed by a rapidly rotating binary lens , or some variant of stellar pulsation .",
    "we do not consider such models .",
    "macho 96-lmc-2 is not the only time that binary source effects have been detected in a microlensing event .",
    "eros - ii event gsa2 @xcite exhibits a similar modulation around the standard microlensing fit .",
    "also find a binary source model degeneracy similar to that between our models x1 ( dominant source ) and x2 ( equal brightness sources ) .",
    "we are able to constrain the projected einstein radius of the lens ( @xmath79 ) in the most significant of our fits to be between 0.54 and 5.5 au , and its velocity projected to the lmc @xmath81 to be between 18.3 and 188 @xmath78 .",
    "the weakness of this constraint ( an order of magnitude ! ) is due to our lack of knowledge of the mass of the secondary component of the lensed binary system . in this model",
    "we have no means to constrain the secondary s orbit due to its negligible contribution to the system s brightness .",
    "we chose example secondaries separated by an order of magnitude in mass ( @xmath7 to @xmath77 ) , leading to order of magnitude constraints on @xmath79 and @xmath81 .",
    "however , in both cases , a lmc lens is preferred to a galactic halo lens . for the larger velocity lens ( model x1b )",
    "the object should come from an as yet undetected lmc halo population , and a galactic halo lens is not strongly ruled out .",
    "the lack of direct evidence for an lmc halo population indicates model x1b is best able to constrain the location of the lens to be out of the lmc disk .",
    "our second most significant model leads to @xmath126 au , and @xmath127 .",
    "this model also prefers a lens in the lmc , with the likelihood heavily weighted towards the lmc disk .",
    "all 3 of these models suggest a sub - solar mass lens , consistent with an m - dwarf star .",
    "our derived values of @xmath79 , @xmath81 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are in good agreement with the characteristic properties of lmc lenses presented in table  1 of .",
    "alternate models for the source system , including one where the sources lie @xmath113 behind the lmc , and one where they are reddened by an additional @xmath130 , were also considered . by placing the sources",
    "far behind the lmc , we are unable to discriminate between the lmc disk and lmc halo population of lenses , and can only state that the lens is most likely associated with the lmc system .",
    "additionally , the qualitative conclusions about the location of the lens are found not to be overly sensitive to the amount of reddening to the sources .",
    "the identification of macho 96-lmc-2 with a lmc lens population is consistent with the expected lmc self - lensing signal .",
    "this single event microlensing optical depth is @xmath131 for criteria `` a '' and `` b '' in , respectively .",
    "this is to be contrasted with an expected self - lensing optical depth of @xmath132 for the lmc disk and @xmath133 for the macho component of our model lmc halo @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that macho lmc-9 is due to lmc self - lensing @xcite , although we caution this interpretation is based on a caustic crossing resolved with only 2 observations , and other interpretations are possible .",
    "lmc-9 is excluded from event set a in , and has an optical depth of @xmath134 .",
    "the expected lmc self - lensing signal due to these 2 events is thus likely to lie within the range @xmath135 .",
    "this is approximately half of the expected lmc self - lensing rate .",
    "thus the combined optical depths alone do not implicate the lmc as the host for the majority of the microlenses , as originally suggested by .",
    "take the ensemble of events lmc-9 and",
    "98-smc-1 and argue that the existence of even a few lmc self - lensing events suggests an lmc halo interpretation of all lmc microlensing . in this context , the appearance of another apparent lmc self - lensing event strengthens the case for significant lmc self - lensing .",
    "however , because of the importance of our result for the interpretation of lmc microlensing , we emphasize the bias a study such as this has against revealing a lens residing in our galactic halo .",
    "in particular , a lensed lmc binary source is preferentially more likely to show xallarap modulations if the lens is also in the lmc . to identify galactic halo lenses , a spectroscopic study of * all",
    "* magellanic cloud microlensed sources should be undertaken to assess whether or not the lensed object is , in fact , a binary system . in the case of a positive detection , we may set limits on xallarap modulation in the microlensing lightcurve , and from this a lower limit on the proper motion of the lensing object . as can be seen from figure  [ fig - like ] ,",
    "galactic halo lenses start to dominate the likelihood near @xmath136",
    ". a lower limit on @xmath81 near this value would be highly suggestive of a true halo lens , and thus detection of at least one component of the galactic dark matter .",

    "<S> = 0.0 in plus 1em    we present photometry and analysis of the microlensing alert macho 96-lmc-2 ( event lmc-14 in ) . </S>",
    "<S> this event was initially detected by the macho alert system , and subsequently monitored by the global microlensing alert network ( gman ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 photometry provided by the gman follow  </S>",
    "<S> up effort reveals a periodic modulation in the lightcurve . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to binarity of the lensed source . </S>",
    "<S> microlensing fits to a rotating binary source magnified by a single lens converge on two minima , separated by @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the most significant fit x1 predicts a primary which contributes @xmath2 of the light , a dark secondary , and an orbital period ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath4 days . </S>",
    "<S> the second fit x2 yields a binary source with two stars of roughly equal mass and luminosity , and @xmath5 days .    </S>",
    "<S> observations made with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) resolve stellar neighbors which contribute to the macho object s baseline brightness . </S>",
    "<S> the actual lensed object appears to lie on the upper lmc main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the mass of the primary component of the binary system , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this helps to determine the physical size of the orbiting system , and allows a measurement of the lens proper motion . for the preferred model x1 </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the range of dark companions by assuming @xmath7 and @xmath8 objects in models x1a and x1b , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find lens velocities projected to the lmc in these models of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in both these cases , a likelihood analysis suggests an lmc lens is preferred over a galactic halo lens , although only marginally so in model x1b . </S>",
    "<S> we also find @xmath11 , where the likelihood for the lens location is strongly dominated by the lmc disk . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> the lens mass is consistent with that of an m - dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> additional spectra of the lensed source system are necessary to further constrain and/or refine the derived properties of the lensing object .    </S>",
    "<S> the lmc self - lensing rate contributed by 96-lmc-2 is consistent with model self - lensing rates . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even if the lens is in the lmc disk , it does not rule out the possibility of galactic halo microlenses altogether . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we emphasize the unique capability of follow - up spectroscopic observations of known microlensed lmc stars , combined with the non - detection of binary source effects , to locate lenses in the galactic halo .    * </S>",
