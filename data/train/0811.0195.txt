    "superconductivity was recently discovered in @xmath5-phase fese@xmath1 system @xcite , shortly after the discovery of superconductivity in feas - based pnictides @xcite .",

    "contrary to the earlier prediction of a low-@xmath6 conventional superconductor @xcite , density functional calculations of the electronic structure , magnetism and electron - phonon coupling for the superconducting phase of fe@xmath0se@xmath7te@xmath2 suggest that superconductivity in this class of materials is unconventional and mediated by spin fluctuations @xcite .",

    "if the observed collinear antiferromagnetic ( af ) order in the parent compounds of the feas - based pnictides @xcite is due to the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) instability of a nested fermi surface @xcite , one would expect to find the same af structure or sdw instability in the nonsuperconducting fe@xmath0se@xmath7te@xmath2 . for feas - based materials such as lafeaso , cefeaso , and prfeaso",

    ". systematic studies of fese@xmath16te@xmath17 and fese@xmath18te@xmath19 reveal that the differences in lattice distortions between fese@xmath2te@xmath7 and lafeaso can account for the differences in their magnetic structures .",
    "these results are difficult to explain within the previous density functional calculations , where fete , fese , and lafeaso are expected to have similar fermi surfaces and therefore similar sdw - type af order @xcite",
    ". however , more recent density functional calculations suggest that the excess fe in fe@xmath0te is strongly magnetic and is also an electron donor , which might account for the observed differences in magnetic structures of fe@xmath0te and other feas - based pnictides @xcite .",
    "we prepared powder samples of fe@xmath0se@xmath7te@xmath2 with nominal composition of @xmath20 using the method described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "fe@xmath0te is non - superconducting while the other two samples have @xmath6 of @xmath14 14 k. powder neutron diffraction data were taken on the bt-1 powder diffractometer at the nist center for neutron research ( ncnr ) .",

    "we used commercial squid and ppms systems to measure the dc susceptibility and specific heat of the samples used for neutron measurements .",

    "this magnetic structure appears to be ubiquitous for parent compounds of feas - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "our refinement on fe@xmath41te suggests that the spin structure in this system is also collinear , and consists of two sublattices with a major component of the moment along the tetragonal @xmath13 axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ structure](b ) . based on our powder diffraction data",
    ", we can not conclusively determine the relative spin directions between the two sublattices ( they may be parallel or antiparallel ) .",
    "the in - plane spin directions in fe@xmath3te are rotated 45 degrees from those in the fe - as materials .",
    "this is different from the prediction of the density functional calculations @xcite , where fermi surfaces of these two materials are expected to be very similar .",
    "in addition to the large moment ( 1.97 @xmath42 ) along the tetragonal @xmath13-axis direction , we find that the projections of the moment along the @xmath12 and @xmath35 -axes were -0.56 @xmath42 , and 0.25 @xmath42 , respectively . although the total moment is similar in fe@xmath3te and fe@xmath43te , the @xmath35-axis component of the moment in fe@xmath43te is 1.36 @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this difference may be related to the excess fe ions in the octahedral sites @xcite , which is expected to be strongly magnetic @xcite . since the moments of the excess fe ions are randomly distributed between the fe - fe layers , the fe moments in fe@xmath43te tend to ca nt toward the @xmath35-axis . with further addition of excess fe into the system ,",
    "the static antiferromagnetic order actually becomes incommensurate @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the excess fe drives the system toward the stoichiometric fete and decreases the influence of the excess fe , this in turn favors the commensurate af spin structure in fig .",

    "to understand the nuclear and magnetic phase transitions , we focus on the ( 1,1,2)/(1,1,-2 ) nuclear and ( 1,0,1)@xmath44 magnetic bragg peaks . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ phasetransition](a ) , the ( 1,1,2)/(1,1,-2 ) reflections split into two peaks due to the tetragonal - monoclinic structural transition . by fitting with one and two gaussian peaks at high and low temperatures , respectively , we find that the structural phase transition happens near 67 k. figure [ phasetransition](b ) shows that the temperature dependence of the ( 1,0,1)@xmath44 magnetic peak is clearly associated with the structural phase transition .",
    "in addition , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the ( 1,0,1)@xmath44 peak is larger than the resolution due to the splitting of the ( 1,0,1)@xmath44 and ( 1,0,-1)@xmath44 peaks .    to see",
    "if the 67 k phase transition is first or second order , we measured the magnetic susceptibility using a squid . figure [ phasetransition](c ) shows that dc susceptibility with field - cooled ( fc ) process and an applied magnetic field of 20 oe has a clear hysteresis near the structural / magnetic phase transition .",
    "the first - order nature of the structural / magnetic phase transitions is shown unambiguously in the heat capacity measurement .",
    "similar to the previous study in fe@xmath45te @xcite , a sharp peak is found around the phase transition temperature [ fig .",
    "[ phasetransition](d ) ] . since the heat capacity option of the ppms does not to work accurately in the vicinity of the first - order transition @xcite , the inset of fig .",
    "[ phasetransition](d ) shows the raw data of the calorimeter , where the plateaus in the heating and cooling processes clearly reveal the heat absorption and liberation during the first - order phase transition .",
    "based on these data , we estimate that the latent heat of the phase transition is @xmath46215 j / mol , meaning a change of entropy of @xmath47 j/(mol@xmath15k ) through the transition .",
    "if we assume that the fe moment in fete is about 3.87 @xmath48 in the paramagnetic state @xcite and 1.7 @xmath49 below @xmath38 , the change of the entropy across the transition based on an ising model is about 3.5 j/(mol@xmath50k ) .",
    "this result suggests that the major contribution to the entropy change at the phase transition arises from the spin ordering , which supports the view that the first order phase transition is driven by the magnetism @xcite .    te , fese@xmath16te@xmath17 and fese@xmath51te@xmath19 .",

    "]    finally , we discuss the lattice distortions and magnetic structure in fe@xmath11se@xmath2te@xmath7 as superconductivity is induced by replacing te with se @xcite .",
    "although we find no static long range ordered magnetic bragg peaks in the superconducting fese@xmath16te@xmath17 and fese@xmath54te@xmath19 similar to the fe - as based materials @xcite , short - range spin fluctuations with correlation length of 9.4   were found in fese@xmath16te@xmath17 at @xmath21 = 0.938 @xmath53 as shown in fig .",
    "[ doping](b ) .",
    "the @xmath21 value is slightly less than the @xmath21 value 0.974 @xmath53 at the commensurate position ( 1,0,1)@xmath44 , which is likely due to the variation of the magnetic form factor as well as a possible variation of the magnetic structure factor .",

    "therefore , within the itinerant electron picture where the observed af order in these two classes of materials arises from the same fermi surface nesting , one should expect a similar spin density wave instablilty , in contrast to the experimental observation .",
    "however , the presence of a large magnetic moment on the excess fe ion in between the ordered fe - layers in fe@xmath0te might resolve this inconsistency @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a model based on the localized magnetic exchange interactions can well explain the experimental results @xcite .",
    "in fact , the difference between the fe - te / se - fe angles along the @xmath12 and @xmath13-axes should result in different next - nearest neighbor couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 that are responsible for the observed collinear af structure .",
    "the difference between angles 1 and 2 due to the monoclinic lattice distortion may give rise to different nearest neighbor couplings @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
