    "according to the latest cosmic microwave background measurements @xcite combined with other cosmological observations @xcite , the matter density of the universe comprises 27% ( for a hubble constant @xmath0  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 ) of the critical density while the remaining 73% is in the form of a cosmological constant of an unknown nature . with only @xmath2  4% of the matter density in the form of baryons , the rest should be of some exotic non  baryonic nature .",
    "this non  luminous and non  relativistic matter , known as cold dark matter , constitutes an essential ingredient in theories of structure formation in the universe . from the class of candidates for cold dark matter generically known as weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , the lightest supersymmetric particle , the neutralino  @xcite , seems to be the most promising .",
    "the upper bound for the mass of the neutralino in the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model is 500  gev  @xcite , its lower bound of 46  gev comes from @xmath3 collider experiments  @xcite .",

    "the type  i superconducting granules are kept slightly below the boundary of their superconducting  to  normal phase transition in a metastable state . the recoil energy released by a particle interacting with a granule causes a temperature increase inversely proportional to the specific heat of the granule . due to the small value of the specific heat at low temperatures ,",

    "a total mass of 207  g was measured for the large granules ( excluding 2 dead channels ) and 215  g for the small ones ( excluding 1 dead channel ) .",
    "the dead channels were due to wiring problems at the pick  up coil and register no output signal . inside the chamber 4 detector modules made of delrin , serve as a holder for the pick  up coils with 14 coils in each module .",

    "the cold box consists of concentric copper thermal shields at temperatures of 1.7 , 4.5 , and 77  k around the detector . because of the limited vertical space available in the bern underground facility , a side access of 1.4  m was necessary to connect the mixing chamber of the dilution unit with the detector chamber .",
