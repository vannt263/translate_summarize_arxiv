    "neutrino oscillations have been robustly established .",
    "the present data require two large ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) angles and one small ( @xmath2 ) angle in the neutrino mixing matrix , and at least two mass squared differences , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 s are the neutrino masses ) , one driving the atmospheric ( @xmath12 ) and the other one the solar ( @xmath13 ) neutrino oscillations .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 control the solar and the atmospheric neutrino oscillations , while @xmath2 is the angle which connects the atmospheric and solar neutrino regimes .    a global fit performed at the end of 2008  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) provides the following @xmath14 allowed ranges for the atmospheric mixing parameters : @xmath15  ev@xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the sign of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) can not be determined from the existing data .",
    "the two possibilities , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , correspond to two different types of neutrino mass ordering : normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy respectively .",
    "in addition , information on the octant of @xmath9 , if @xmath22 , is beyond the reach of present experiments .",
    "the best fit values for the solar neutrino oscillation parameters are @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite . a non - zero value of @xmath2 is crucial to enable a measurement of the cp violating phase @xmath3 and the mass hierarchy . a combined three - neutrino oscillation analysis of the solar , atmospheric , reactor and long - baseline neutrino data  @xcite constrains the third mixing angle to be @xmath25 at the @xmath14 confidence level , with a best fit value of @xmath26 .",
    "different analyses undertaken in 2008 using the available solar data from the third phase of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno - iii ) and recent data from kamland favour a non - zero value of @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , super - kamiokande data on atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite leads to a @xmath29 preference for @xmath30 .",
    "this second claim is , however , controversial  @xcite .",
    "2009 data from the minos experiment , studying the appearance channel @xmath31 , also favours a non - zero value of @xmath2 but with an even larger best fit , even more in conflict with the stringent upper bound that comes mainly from the chooz reactor experiment of @xmath25 .",
    "a preliminary combination of all the data provides a @xmath32 range of @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this hint for non - zero @xmath2 and the resulting tension among the different datasets will be probed by the forthcoming generation of accelerator @xcite and reactor @xcite experiments .",
    "if the hint for large @xmath2 is confirmed , the exciting possibility to search for leptonic cp violation , encoded in the phase @xmath3 , and the ordering of neutrino masses @xcite , will be open .",
    "however , these experiments lack the required sensitivity and a new generation of neutrino oscillation experiments is therefore needed for this task , and to explore even smaller values of @xmath2 if the present hint is not confirmed .",
    "future long - baseline experiments will require powerful machines and extremely pure neutrino beams . among these , neutrino factories  @xcite , in which a neutrino beam is generated from muons decaying within the straight sections of a storage ring ,",
    "have been shown to be sensitive tools for studying neutrino oscillation physics  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino factory exploits the golden signature of the _ wrong - sign _",
    "muon  @xcite events , i.e. muons with opposite sign to the muons stored in the neutrino factory .",
    "wrong - sign muons ( @xmath34 ) result from @xmath35 oscillations ( if @xmath36 are stored ) , and can be used to measure the mixing angle @xmath2 , determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , and search for cp violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "in addition to the _ wrong - sign _ muon signal , there will also be _ right - sign _ muon events .",
    "these events come from the disappearance muon neutrino channel , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , if positive ( negative ) muons are stored .",
    "the discrimination of the _ wrong _ and _ right _ sign muons requires the identification of charged current ( cc ) muon neutrino interactions , and the measurement of the sign of the produced muon .",
    "if the interacting neutrinos have energies of more than a few gev , standard neutrino detector technology , based on large magnetised sampling calorimeters , can be used to measure wrong - sign muons with high efficiency and very low backgrounds .",
    "this has been shown to work for neutrino factories with energies of about 20 gev or greater  @xcite .",
    "lower energy neutrino factories  @xcite , which store muons with energies @xmath39  gev , exploit a fully active calorimeter within a magnet , a detector technology which ensures the detection of lower energy muons .",
    "the possibility of a low energy neutrino factory with non - magnetic detectors has also been explored in  @xcite , although we have not considered it here .",
    "a neutrino factory with muon energies of about 4 gev has been shown to enable very precise measurements of the neutrino mixing parameters  @xcite .",
    "electron charge identification also becomes possible in a low energy neutrino factory equipped with a magnetised totally active scintillating detector ( tasd )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the wrong and right - sign _ muons _ , there will also be wrong and right - sign _ electrons _ from the appearance channel ( the _ platinum _ channel ) , @xmath40 , and the disappearance channel , @xmath41 , for positive muons stored in the decay ring  .",
    "these _ platinum _ channels , which are the t - conjugates of the golden channels , could provide a possible way of resolving the problem of degenerate solutions  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that even a very precise measurement of the appearance probability for neutrinos and antineutrinos at a fixed @xmath42 allows for different solutions of @xmath43 , severely weakening the sensitivity to these parameters .",
    "many strategies have been advocated to resolve this issue which in general involve another detector  @xcite , the combination with another experiment   @xcite and/or the addition of new channels  @xcite .",
    "we will consider the impact of the addition of the platinum channels in both a low statistics and high statistics scenario .",
    "we will show that if the platinum channel is accessible with negligible backgrounds ( by which we mean a charge misidentification rate of @xmath44 , and that fewer than @xmath45 of all neutral current events are wrongly counted as signal events - see section  [ subsec : plat ] for more details ) , in the case of low statistics , its addition would greatly increase the potential of the low energy neutrino factory .",
    "however for the high statistics scenario , the platinum channel has much less of an effect - higher statistics combined with complementary information from the different energies of a broad beam alone are sufficient to resolve degeneracies and maximise the performance of the setup .",
    "unfortunately , once realistic backgrounds from misidentified pions and the challenging electron charge identification are taken into account , the addition of the platinum channel does not provide any significant improvement .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : physics ] we discuss in detail the physics reach of the proposed setup , which exploits the wrong and right sign muon and electron signals .",
    "based on the reasons described in section  [ sec : physics ] , the decaying muon statistics assumed here is higher than in previous studies .",
    "the assumptions for the detection efficiencies and energy resolution of the detector have also been modestly improved , based on the simulated performance of the no@xmath46a tasd detector @xcite .",
    "these assumptions provide a more competitive setup with respect to our previous studies  @xcite .",
    "we perform detailed numerical simulations and discuss the sensitivity of the low energy neutrino factory to the mixing angle @xmath2 , to the cp violating phase @xmath3 , to the neutrino mass hierarchy , to the octant of the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath9 and to deviations from maximal atmospheric mixing as a function of the energy resolution of the detector and the number of muon decays per year ( with and without the addition of the platinum channels ) . in section  [ sec : lar ] we introduce our preliminary studies of a magnetised 100 kton liquid argon ( lar ) detector , comparing its performance to that of the tasd and other near term and future long - baseline neutrino facilities .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we present the results from numerical simulations of the low energy neutrino factory .",
    "we have used the globes software package  @xcite to simulate several experimental configurations which will be described in the following subsections . these have led us to an optimised setup , which we use unless otherwise specified , defined by the following : the baseline is 1300 km , corresponding to the fermilab to dusel distance . for the beam we consider a muon energy of 4.5 gev with @xmath47 useful muon decays per year per polarity , running for ten years .",
    "this flux is larger than the @xmath48 useful muon decays per year per polarity usually considered for the international design study ( ids ) neutrino factory  @xcite for three reasons .",
    "firstly , the ids neutrino factory distributes the beam to two baselines whilst only one baseline is required for the low energy neutrino factory - therefore a factor of two is gained .",
    "moreover , @xmath49 operational seconds per year were assumed in  @xcite whilst we consider that @xmath50 operational seconds per year should be achievable .",
    "however , in order to perform an equal comparison with other facilities , @xmath49 seconds per year were assumed in the comparison plots of section  [ sec : lar ] .",
    "finally , the extra factor of 1.4 arises from a re - optimisation of the accelerator complex for the lower muon energy required with respect to the ids design  @xcite .    for the detector we assume a totally active scintillating detector ( tasd ) with a fiducial mass of 20 kton , energy threshold of 0.5 gev , energy resolution of @xmath51 with 19 variable - width bins , efficiency for @xmath52 detection of @xmath53 below 1 gev and @xmath54 above , and a background level of @xmath55 on the @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) channels .",
    "we assume that the background to each channel arises predominantly from charge misidentification and neutral current events , modeling the background to each channel as a constant fraction of the rates of the wrong - sign and neutral current channels .",
    "for systematics , we use @xmath60 on both the signal and background , assuming the errors to be uncorrelated .    for the platinum ( @xmath31 and @xmath61 ) channels",
    ", identifying the charges of the electrons at the energies involved will be very challenging .",
    "in addition , the pion background is very difficult to separate from the electron samples as compared to the muon samples .",
    "preliminary estimations  @xcite suggest that the efficiency for @xmath62 detection could be @xmath63 below 1 gev and @xmath64 above , and that the backgrounds ( we make similar assumptions for the background sources as for the muon channels ) could be reduced to a level of @xmath45 . although it is uncertain as to whether this detector performance can actually be achieved - further simulations are required - we will regard these numbers as an optimistic estimate for the electron detection capabilities of a tasd .",
    "we assume the same oscillation parameters as in  @xcite : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ev@xmath16 , and @xmath68 ev@xmath16 with a @xmath51 uncertainty on the atmospheric parameters , @xmath69 uncertainty on the solar parameters , and @xmath60 uncertainty on the matter density . in all our simulations",
    "we have used the exact oscillation probabilities , taking into account matter effects , and have marginalised over all parameters .    the most significant alteration relative to the previous setup  @xcite consists of the addition of the @xmath31 and @xmath61 channels . these _ platinum _ channels are the t - conjugates of the golden channels ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , and we will investigate the power of this combination to reduce the degeneracies in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and sign(@xmath18 ) parameter space .",
    "it has been shown that typically , the elimination of these degenerate solutions may require additional information from a second baseline and detector  @xcite , or from a complementary experiment  @xcite .",
    "we try instead to exploit the ability of the tasd to detect and identify the charge of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which gives access to the platinum channel .",
    "the probability for this channel , to leading order in the small quantities @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 = @xmath75 is the matter potential and @xmath76 is the electron number density ) , is identical to that for the golden channel  @xcite with the interchange of @xmath77 and is shown below    @xmath78    @xmath79    we use a notation where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the neutrino energy and @xmath85 is the baseline .",
    "the first line of each probability , subequations ( [ eq : atm ] ) and ( [ eq : atm2 ] ) , is the _ atmospheric term _ which is quadratic in @xmath86 and will be dominant in the scenario that @xmath2 is large ( @xmath87 ) , and at high energies .",
    "the atmospheric term provides sensitivity to @xmath2 , the mass hierarchy , and is sensitive to the octant of @xmath9 .",
    "the second line , subequations ( [ eq : cp ] ) and ( [ eq : cp2 ] ) , is the _ cp term _ which is linear in @xmath86 and dominates for intermediate values of @xmath2 if @xmath88 @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath3 enters via the oscillatory cosine term which can take either a positive or negative sign depending on the value of the phase .",
    "this can lead to constructive or destructive interference between the atmospheric and cp terms , meaning that sensitivities to @xmath2 and the mass hierarchy are strongly dependent on the value of @xmath3 . due to the inverse dependence on energy ,",
    "the cp term becomes most visible at lower energies ; therefore it is important to have access to the second oscillation maximum to establish if cp is violated .",
    "thus a lower energy is desirable to enable a clean measurement of @xmath3 , whereas a higher energy and , especially , a long - baseline , guarantees sensitivity to the mass hierarchy .",
    "the low energy neutrino factory is unique in having a surprising degree of sensitivity to the mass hierarchy in spite of its low energy ( as we show in section  [ subsec : tasdresults ] ) due to its broad spectrum that includes energies beyond the first oscillation peak , thus enabling complementary information to be obtained to resolve degeneracies .",
    "the third line , subequations ( [ eq : solar ] ) and ( [ eq : solar2 ] ) , is the _ solar term _ which is independent of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the mass hierarchy , and is dominant in the case that @xmath2 is very small ( @xmath91 ) . in this regime",
    ", measurements will be extremely challenging and a high energy neutrino factory may be the only option  @xcite .",
    "if we consider the fact that the probability for the cp - conjugated golden channel , @xmath57 , takes a similar form to that of the golden channel but with the substitutions @xmath77 and @xmath92 and that the cpt - conjugated golden channel is identical to the golden channel , with the exchange of @xmath92 , we can understand the complementarity of these four channels : each of the channels has a different dependence on the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and sign(@xmath18 ) and so degenerate solutions are present at _ different _ points in the parameter space for each of the channels  @xcite .",
    "thus the degenerate solutions from one channel can be eliminated by the information from another channel .",
    "we will mention briefly that the ability of the tasd to detect electrons also enables measurement of the @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) disappearance channel whose probability is @xmath95 however , as this channel is cp - invariant and has only a weak dependence on the mass hierarchy , it is expected and has been verified in our study that its addition does not provide any significant improvement .    in the rest of this section",
    "we now show the impact of our improved statistics and energy resolution , and of the addition of the platinum channels .",
    "+    firstly we illustrate how our more optimistic estimate of @xmath51 for the energy resolution , @xmath96 , ( with 19 variable width bins ) improves the performance of our setup . in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] we show how the new resolution improves upon the old value of @xmath97 ( with nine variable width bins ) for @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we observe that in addition to the significant increase in sensitivity to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the hierarchy degeneracy is now almost completely eliminated even for small values of @xmath2 .",
    "this is possible because at these low energies , the oscillation probability displays a rich dependence on the oscillation parameters as a function of the neutrino energy . in particular ,",
    "the hierarchy can be determined from the position of the first oscillation maximum , and the value of @xmath3 from both the first and second oscillation maxima . hence if the neutrino energy can be measured with sufficient precision to enable",
    "the oscillation spectrum to be accurately reconstructed , a significant improvement in the sensitivities to the oscillation parameters can be achieved .",
    "we define _ scenario 1 _ to be the one in which only @xmath52 detection is possible , giving us access to only the @xmath100 and @xmath101 appearance and disappearance channels . in _",
    "scenario 2 _ it is also possible to detect @xmath62 and hence exploit the additional information from the @xmath93 and @xmath94 appearance channels . to illustrate the impact of the addition of the platinum channel to our setup , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] we compare the sensitivities of the two scenarios when using a muon decay rate of @xmath102 ( left column ) and @xmath47 ( right column ) per year , varying the background level of the @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) appearance channel from a hypothetical zero ( top row ) to @xmath45 ( bottom row ) . by this",
    "we mean that we have simulated a charge misidentification rate such that @xmath45 of all @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) are wrongly identified as @xmath71 ( @xmath70 ) , and that @xmath45 of all @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) neutral current events are wrongly counted as signal events .    in the case of the lower statistics , we observe that the addition of the platinum channel with zero background produces a drastic improvement in sensitivity to all parameters . for a background of @xmath45",
    "the improvement is much smaller but can still help to alleviate the hierarchy degeneracy ( see  @xcite ) . at higher backgrounds we find that this gain is lost . in the case of the high statistics ,",
    "we already observe a smaller improvement for zero background , which becomes insignificant at a background level of @xmath45 .",
    "thus we conclude that since the estimated background on the @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) appearance channels will be at best @xmath103 , the platinum channel could help in the measurement of the mass hierarchy if statistics are limited to @xmath102 useful muon decays per year , whereas it will be almost irrelevant for the higher statistics scenario .",
    "an increase in statistics in the golden channel thus provides a much larger improvement in the facility performance than the addition of the platinum channel if background levels below @xmath45 can not be achieved .     +   +       +   +    here we present the results of our optimisation studies , in terms of @xmath14 @xmath2 discovery potential , cp discovery potential , and sensitivity to the mass hierarchy in the @xmath104 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tasd_sens ] ) .",
    "in addition we also consider the @xmath14 sensitivity to @xmath9 in the @xmath105 plane , both in terms of the ability to exclude a maximal value of @xmath9 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : tasd_th23]a ) and to identify the octant of @xmath9 ( fig .",

    "we demonstrate that for all the observables considered , doubling the flux is always preferable to an increase in energy .",
    "+    for @xmath2 discovery potential , cp discovery potential and @xmath9 sensitivity we only show the results for a normal hierarchy , having verified that similar results are obtained for an inverted hierarchy .",
    "we have assumed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tasd_th23 ] ( @xmath9 sensitivity ) a value of @xmath107 although we have also studied other values of @xmath3 and find no strong dependence on the cp phase , since sensitivity to @xmath9 is mainly obtained from terms with no dependence on @xmath3 in the oscillation probabilities discussed in section  [ sec : physics ] . for the exclusion of @xmath108 ,",
    "an upward curve is seen for large @xmath2 . this can be understood because the addition of a large @xmath2 to the @xmath109 disappearance probability introduces an asymmetry in @xmath9 that shifts the contours to larger values ( see eq .  ( 1 ) and fig .  8 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we note that this setup has remarkable sensitivity to @xmath2 and @xmath3 for values of @xmath6 , and that its sensitivity to the mass hierarchy is an order of magnitude better that that of other proposed experiments exploiting the same baseline e.g. the wide - band beam experiment in  @xcite .",
    "we can attribute these qualities to the unique combination of high statistics and good background rejection coupled with an intermediate baseline , allowing for a clean measurement of the cp phase whilst also allowing for the mass hierarchy to be determined for @xmath7 .",
    "we have also explored how the precision with which @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the deviation from maximal @xmath9 could eventually be measured at the low energy neutrino factory , varies as a function of exposure ( detector mass @xmath5 decays ) per polarity .",

    "we have also studied the sensitivity to @xmath9 , finding that it is possible to exclude maximal @xmath9 at @xmath14 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 , roughly independent of @xmath2 , and to identify the octant for @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "studies of the sensitivities as a function of exposure ( detector mass @xmath5 number of decays ) show that the effect of non - zero systematic errors and backgrounds is to effectively halve the exposure , affecting the sensitivity to @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( especially for @xmath139 ) and @xmath9 . for exposures",
    "@xmath140 kton @xmath5 decays per polarity and large @xmath2 , the low energy neutrino factory could measure the oscillation parameters with unprecedented precision .",
    "we conclude that the low energy neutrino factory has excellent sensitivity to the standard oscillation parameters and is therefore a potential candidate for a next - generation long - baseline experiment .",
