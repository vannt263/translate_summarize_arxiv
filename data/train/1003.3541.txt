    "the research on the geometric properties of growing surfaces is one of the most important in the field of the non - equilibrium statistical physics , not only because it is a challenge for the theoretical physicist to model these properties , but especially for the intrinsic experimental interest in shaping the surfaces with desired purposes @xcite .",
    "the random deposition is the simplest known model , where particles are aggregated onto an initially flat substrate .",
    "because lateral correlations among the deposited particles are completely neglected , the continuous and discrete atomistic versions of the model have exact solutions .",
    "if a surface relaxation mechanism is allowed to the deposited particles in the random deposition model , height - height correlations naturally appear .",
    "although the corresponding discrete model did not present an exact solution , it can be described by the linear edwards - wilkinson equation ( ew ) @xcite , which is exactly soluble .",
    "a generalization of the ( ew ) equation was proposed by kardar , parisi and zhang in 1986 , including a non - linear term that accounts for the lateral growth of the interface .",
    "although the growth process is a local phenomenon , the lateral growth is related to the spreading of the heigth fluctuations along the surface .",
    "this is characterized by a correlation length that increases with time , and it reaches a maximum value corresponding to the linear dimension of the substrate .",
    "a perpendicular correlation length is also defined that is related to the fluctuations in heigth along the growth direction .",
    "the non - linear kpz equation @xcite is very useful to describe porous deposits , as those ones generated by the ballistic deposition of particles @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the surface is described by the interface width @xmath2 , which characterizes the roughness of the interface , is defined by the rms deviation of the height @xmath3 around is average value @xmath4 , that is ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the linear dimension of the substrate , @xmath7 is the time elapsed after the growth start , the overbar indicates spatial average and the angular brackets mean configurational averages .",
    "it is well established that a large class of growth models follow the family - vicsek scaling relation @xcite    @xmath8    where the scaling function @xmath9 is a constant when @xmath10 is very large , and @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",
    "the exponent @xmath13 characterizes the interface width , @xmath1 is the dynamic exponent , while @xmath14 is the growth exponent .",
    "these exponents are not independent and are related by @xmath15 .",
    "most of the studies performed in the area of surface growth focus their attention in the determination of these exponents , and whether they fit to the family - vicsek ansatz .",
    "these calculations have been done analytically , by solving stochastic differential equations or employing mean field approximations , and through extensive use of monte carlo simulations @xcite . in this work",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to study the surface growth in @xmath16 dimensions due to the deposition of particles of different sizes .",
    "there are in literature some studies where two or more different deposition models are combined @xcite or two species of particles are deposited @xcite in order to describe the time evolution of roughness in real systems . here , we choose our particles to be deposited from a modified poisson distribution , with average size equals to five lattice spacings and maximum size equals to nine .",
    "this type of distribution appears to be relevant in some ash particles deposition on the heat exchange surfaces @xcite .",
    "we also consider in this work , the deposition of identical particles , which size is larger than one lattice spacing of the substrate .",
    "the deposition of particles proceeds as in the pure random deposition model , however , correlations between columns naturally appear due to the deposition of particles larger than one lattice spacing . the random deposition of particles of unit size generates a compact bulk and an infinitely large interface width .",
    "this means that for a linear substrate of size @xmath6 , @xmath2 becomes infinitely large as the deposition time @xmath7 goes to infinite . on the other hand , the deposition of particles larger than one unit produces a porous bulk .",
    "then , we can determine the evolution of the porosity of the bulk simultaneously with the scaling properties of the surface .",
    "we say that the interface width satisfying eq .",
    "( 2 ) is self - affine , which means that rescaling part of the interface anisotropically we obtain an interface that is statistically indistinguishable from the whole one . in order to characterize the morphology of a rough interface",
    ", it is sufficient to know the value of the exponent @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we show that the surface growth presents three different behaviors as a function of time . at the initial times",
    ", it behaves as in the usual random deposition of particles of unit size .",
    "then , at intermediate times , when the lateral correlations between columns develop , it grows more slowly , and finally reaches a saturation regime at long times .",
    "porosity attains the saturation regime faster than the interface width , and it presents large values even for the smallest particle of size two lattice spacings .",
    "finite - size effects are not observed for this property , and for particles of size corresponding to four lattice units of the substrate , the porosity is already @xmath17 of the maximum possible porosity , that is , @xmath18 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model , the deposition rules and some details concerning the monte carlo simulations . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results for the interface width as a function of particles sizes .",
    "iv contains the results for the scaling exponents when the deposited particles are identical , and sec .",
    "v is devoted to the study of bulk porosity . finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we present our main conclusions .",
    "we propose a model where the particles are dropped randomly over a finite linear substrate , which is divided into cells of unit size .",
    "all the particles also have unit height and the columns where they land are increased by one unit .",
    "particles of different sizes are selected from a modified poisson distribution , with sizes changing by one order of magnitude .",
    "the most important difference between this model and the simple random deposition , where only particles of unit size are deposited , is that the present model naturally allows for correlations among the columns , that is , it leads to a lateral growth of the interface .",
    "we studied the effect of particles s sizes on the scaling exponents , as well as on the global porosity . in this study , we performed monte carlo simulations in two quite different conditions : 1 ) adding particles of different sizes , and 2 ) adding identical particles . for the deposition of identical particles ,",
    "only particles which are larger than one lattice spacing of the substrate are considered . in the case of particles of different sizes ,",
    "they are selected from a modified poisson distribution .",
    "the poisson distribution was modified in this work in order to take into account the discrete nature of the particles and a maximum size of the particle to be deposited during our monte carlo simulations .",
    "the probability of a particle with size equal to @xmath19 to be selected for a deposition trial is    @xmath20    where @xmath19 ranges from @xmath21 to @xmath22 lattice spacings , which is the maximum permitted size for deposition in the present model .",
    "as we fixed @xmath10 at the value @xmath23 , the normalization factor @xmath24 is equal to _ 0.96143_. therefore , this is a type of a modified poisson distribution with a finite set of possible results . for a true poisson distribution , where all values of @xmath19 are possible , @xmath10 should be the average value of the distribution and the normalization factor @xmath25 .",
    "this modified poisson distribution is believed to be realistic to describe some ash deposits , where particles s sizes may vary by two or more orders of magnitude , and are well represented by a poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "when we perform simulations with particles of different sizes , the particles to be deposited are flat , height one , and may change from ( 1 x 1 ) to ( 9 x 1 ) in units of the lattice parameter of the linear substrate , according to the modified poisson distribution . in the case of deposition of identical particles ,",
    "we choose just one species of particle , with a defined size .",
    "the simulations in this work are performed in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , the resulting deposit is two - dimensional , and we always use periodic boundary conditions along the linear substrate .    to add a particle on the substrate , a cell on the lattice is randomly selected . at this selected position we place the midpoint of the particle , trying to extend horizontally , at both sides of the initial position , this site to the full size of the particle . in the case of particles with even size , as 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 lattice spacings , we choose as their midpoint , the position 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "we allow the reflection of a particle by the surface and , in this case , the trial of deposition is lost , the particle is not incorporated to the substrate .",
    "the reflection is due to the geometric constraint properties of the surface . for each particle deposition attempt",
    ", we look at the number of vacant sites around a randomly selected position on the substrate .",
    "the number of vacant sites around this site determines the possible deposition or reflection of the selected particle .",
    "if the vacant region is smaller than the size of the selected particle , the particle will be rejected . on the other hand ,",
    "if the vacant region is larger or equal to the size of the particle , there are no geometric restrictions and the incident particle permanently sticks to that region .",
    "the growth rules are ilustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] . the particle labeled by",
    "`` a '' will not be incorporated to the surface , while the particle labeled by `` b '' is added to the deposit . under the `` b '' particle , a shadow zone",
    "is created , where no other particle can be aggregated .",
    "this is the mechanism that leads to the formation of a porous structure inside the bulk . in order to determine the global porosity",
    ", we calculate the quantity    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the volume occupied by the vacant sites , and @xmath28 is the proper volume occupied by particles .",
    "the vacant sites here mean only the empty sites not belonging to the surface . the overhangs from the topmost layer are not considered vacant sites . in this work , we show that the deposition of particles larger than one lattice parameter of the substrate , generates a highly two - dimensional porous structure .",
    "the time evolution of the porosity and its dependence on the size of the deposited particles are presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we focus our simulations on the estimate of the scaling exponents and determination of the universality class of the model , when the deposited particles are selected from the probability distribution , eq.(3 ) .",
    "the usual scaling exponents : the growth , roughness and dynamic exponents , and also the global porosity in the bulk , are calculated for deposition of particles larger than one lattice spacing .",
    "some earlier studies @xcite , clearly point for the existence of two different regimes of growth , with growth exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 , when only two species of particles are deposited .",
    "the observation of the data for the time evolution of the roughness shows a change in its behavior , from an uncorrelated growth , whose exponent is @xmath29 to another one , where lateral correlations are present , which is characterized by a second growth exponent , @xmath30 .    at the very initial times , the surface is free of lateral correlations , once the particles are incorporated to the substrate , following the rules of the random deposition model .",
    "the exponent @xmath29 is near @xmath31 , which is the typical value for the random deposition model .",
    "however , at intermediate times , height - height correlations develop and we find a smaller value for the growth exponent @xmath30 .",
    "finally , at long times , the roughness enters into a saturation regime , and the surface is characterized by the roughness exponent @xmath13 .    in fig [ fig : figure2 ]",
    "we show the log - log plot for the time evolution of the roughness , where simulations were performed with particles selected from the poisson distribution , eq .",
    "( 3 ) , with @xmath32 and @xmath19 ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "the results we are showing , represent averages considering 10@xmath35 different samples for the linear sizes l = 1024 , 2048 and 400 samples for l = 4096 and 8192 . in this log - log plot",
    "we see two different linear regimes at the initial times , where we find the value @xmath29 = 0.503 @xmath36 0.005 for all the lattice sizes , which is close to the expected value for the random deposition model , whose exact value is @xmath31 in any spatial dimension .    at intermediate times , the interface width grows more slowly , with another growth exponent , @xmath30 , which is not in the same universality class of the random deposition model .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2 ] shows that this exponent depends on the lattice size l , specially for the smallest system sizes , which is a typical finite size behavior . for larger system sizes @xmath30",
    "smoothly increases with l , reaching a limiting value when @xmath37 . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] we show the plot of the growth exponent @xmath30 as a function of 1/l .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath37 gives the best value for this exponent , @xmath38 .",
    "fortuitously , it is close to the value 1/3 , which is the exact result for the ballistic deposition in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , described by the kpz equation .",
    "on the other hand , at long times , when the surface width reaches its saturation value for each lattice size , we can estimate through equation [ family_vicsek ] the value of the corresponding roughness exponent .",
    "we have found that @xmath13 = 0.94@xmath360.01 .",
    "another method to determine @xmath13 is by using the rms fluctuation of the squared roughness in the steady state , presented in refs .",
    "this procedure gives an estimate for the roughness exponent , which is much less dependent on the finite - size corrections .",
    "the effective roughness exponent is defined as    @xmath39}{ln2 } ,   \\label{alpha}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is defined by    @xmath41    using this method we have found that @xmath13 = 0.942 , which is in good agreement with our estimate based on the equation [ family_vicsek ] . with the values of @xmath13 and @xmath30 ,",
    "the dynamical critical exponent is @xmath42 , which comes from the family - vicsek scaling relation . after deposition",
    ", particles can not migrate either downwards or upwards , and there is no surface diffusion in the present model .",
    "the exponents we calculated , @xmath13 , @xmath30 and @xmath1 fit very well to the nonlinear model , with conservative dynamics and non conservative noise in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , which is described by the villain - lai - das sarma equation @xcite .",
    "the exponents of this model were exactly determined from the renormalization group recurrence relations , where the nonlinear term determines the scaling behavior and the upper critical dimension is @xmath43 . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the exponents are : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the deposition problems ,",
    "we say that a given relaxation process is conservative if it does not change the number of particles in the system .",
    "on the other hand , a noise is said to be nonconservative when its correlation function at coordinates @xmath48 and @xmath49 is of the white noise type , that is , it is the product of two dirac s delta functions : one of them , is a function of the difference between the two spatial positions @xmath50 , and the other a function of the difference between the two times , @xmath51 .",
    "for surfaces formed by depositing identical particles , only particles with size in the range 2 to 9 lattice units of the linear substrate were considered . in our simulations ,",
    "the particles are flat , with variable horizontal length ( _ 2 @xmath52 n @xmath52 9 _ ) and vertical height corresponding to one unit .",
    "the deposition rules are exactly the same as the ones presented in the previous section .",
    "the dependence of the surface width on the size of the particle is very weak and its behavior as a function of time for different lattice sizes is very similar to that seen for the deposition of particles of different sizes .",
