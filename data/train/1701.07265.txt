    "x - ray observations of stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) in binary systems have allowed for the study of the properties of the accretion disks that surround them , as well as their changes over time ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "radio observations of these systems have allowed us to gain knowledge of the ejection processes in the form of relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "simultaneous observations have revealed the existence of non - linear correlations between the x - ray and radio luminosities during the so - called low / hard and quiescent states that are consistent with scale - invariant jet models @xcite .",
    "however , these studies have mainly been conducted for bhs in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) because the only confirmed bh in a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) in the galaxy before the discovery of mwc  656 , namely , always displays a high luminosity and does not allow us to trace the correlation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    is the first binary system containing a bh in orbit around a be star @xcite .",
    "its discovery was triggered by the detection , with _ agile _ , of the transient gamma - ray source @xcite , undetected with _",
    "fermi_/lat @xcite but recently reported to show recurrent activity with hints of long - term variability with _ agile _",
    "the binary nature of mwc  656 ( a bright be star also named ) was suggested by a 60.37  d periodicity in optical photometry @xcite , and later confirmed through radial velocity studies @xcite .",
    "a detailed spectroscopic analysis revealed the presence of a emission line at @xmath104686    that could only be produced in an accretion disk around the invisible companion to the be star . a re - analysis of radial velocity data using an emission line from the be circumstellar disk and the emission line from the accretion disk , together with an improved spectral type classification of b1.5-b2iii for the be star , provided a mass for the compact object in the range of 3.86.9  m@xmath5 , thus confirming its bh nature @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the first be / bh system is relevant in the context of binary system evolution .",
    "although it partially solves the problem of the absence of be / bh systems @xcite , the discovery of mwc  656 is observationally biased by the lack of a bright x - ray counterpart , suggesting that there might be a large number of hidden be / bh systems .",
    "in addition , simulations have shown that it is very difficult to form be / bh binaries with properties similar to those of mwc  656 , although they can evolve into close ns / bh systems that will merge on timescales of a few gyr and produce gravitational waves detectable with advanced ligo / virgo in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted a 14-ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of mwc  656 on 2013 june 4 that provided the detection between 0.3 and 5.5  kev of a faint source coincident at the 2.4@xmath11 level with mwc  656 .",
    "this revealed that mwc  656 was a new hmxb .",
    "the spectrum analysis required a model fit with two components , a blackbody plus a power law , the latter dominating above @xmath120.8  kev .",
    "the thermal emission was proposed to arise from the wind of the be star , while the non - thermal emission arose from the vicinity of the bh . the observed non - thermal luminosity was @xmath13  erg  s@xmath3 , or @xmath14 for a source distance of @xmath15  kpc , indicating a bh in deep quiescence ( see @xcite for reference ) .",

    ", we report on a deep joint _ chandra_/vla observation ( and contemporaneous optical data ) of the first be / bh binary mwc  656 that has allowed us to : 1 )  resolve the _ xmm - newton _ detection into two sources , one of them unambiguously associated with mwc  656 ; 2 )  find that it is significantly fainter than two years before and reaches the faintest quiescent luminosities detected in stellar - mass bhs ; and 3 )  detect a faint radio counterpart and find that the obtained x - ray / radio luminosities for this quiescent bh hmxb are fully compatible with those of the x - ray / radio correlations derived from quiescent bh lmxbs at the low - luminosity end .",
    "mwc  656 was observed with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ acis - s camera using the vfaint data mode during @xmath1760  ks , from 2015 july 24 at 21:03  ut to july 25 at 14:29  ut ( pi : m. rib ; ) .",
    "the observation covered the orbital phase range 0.010.02 ( using jd@xmath18 from @xcite ) .",
    "the data were analyzed using the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software , v4.7 @xcite .",
    "the event files were reprocessed by means of the chandra_repro script .",

    "chandra _ presents higher sensitivity .",
    "we show the _ chandra _ x - ray image of the field around mwc  656 in figure  [ fig : chandra_image ] , together with the contours of the previous _ xmm - newton _ image reported in @xcite . inspection of the x - ray image superimposing optical positions from the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite reveals a systematic offset . using three common sources we have applied a correction of ra  @xmath19 and dec  @xmath20 to the _ chandra _ data ( and of ra  @xmath21 and dec  @xmath22 to the _ xmm - newton _ data using the only common source ) .",
    "the better angular resolution of _ chandra _ has allowed us to resolve the _ xmm - newton _ source into two sources .",
    "we have used the wavdetect algorithm to obtain the significance and positions of both sources .",
    "mwc  656 is detected at the 8.5@xmath11 confidence level ( c.l . ) , with equatorial coordinates ( after correction ) ra  @xmath23 , dec  @xmath24 ( uncertainties are statistical only and at 1@xmath11 c.l . ) .",
    "the position of mwc  656 from _ gaia _ data at the epoch of the _ chandra _ observation ( epoch=2015.56 ) following @xcite and @xcite is : ra  @xmath25 , dec  @xmath26 .",
    "the offset between both positions is @xmath27 , and the _ chandra _ source is thus the counterpart of mwc  656 .",
    "the new source , located @xmath1713@xmath28 to the southeast of mwc  656 , is detected at a 15.9@xmath11 c.l . and has equatorial coordinates ( after correction ) ra  @xmath29 , dec  @xmath30 , and thus is named ( cxou-1 from now on ) .",
    "image reveals that mwc  656 is fainter than cxou-1 ( see below ) , while the shape of the _ xmm - newton _ contours reveals that in 2013 june mwc  656 was brighter than cxou-1 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with the use of the srcflux script we extracted net counts for mwc  656 ( @xmath31 at 90% c.l . ) and cxou-1 ( @xmath32 ) , taking into account the background and the point - spread function of the instrument .",
    "these measurements were obtained from a region centered at the peak of the x - ray emission ( found by wavdetect ) of each source with a radius of 3 , while background counts were obtained from a nearby circular region with a 10  radius , avoiding contamination from nearby sources , always within the 0.58.0  kev energy band .",
    "we used xspec version 12.8.2 @xcite to perform a spectral analysis of both sources .",
    "the same regions for source and background used to extract net counts were considered .",
    "we created response files in order to take into account the energy - dependent behavior of the instrument .",
    "we fitted the spectra with two distinct models , an absorbed power law and an absorbed blackbody , always using a fixed column density of @xmath33  @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the low number of counts required the use of the cstat statistic within xspec to estimate the best - fit parameters and their associated uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we show the spectra of mwc  656 and cxou-1 , together with the fitted models , in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the results of the fits are listed in table  [ table : spectra ] .",
    "although both sources can be fitted with either model , the obtained @xmath34-statistics reveal that the power - law model is preferred since blackbody models result in an excess at both low and high energies .",
    "the obtained fluxes for the power - law models in the 0.58  kev range are @xmath35  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 for mwc  656 and @xmath36  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 for cxou-1 .",
    "although cxou-1 appears brighter in figure  [ fig : chandra_image ] , the fluxes obtained by the spectral analysis are compatible at 1@xmath11 c.l .",
    "the power - law fit for mwc  656 provides a photon index of @xmath37 , while for cxou-1 we obtain @xmath38 , thus fully compatible at 1@xmath11 c.l .",
    "the conclusion from the analysis of the _ chandra _ data is that both sources have a similar spectrum , while the x - ray flux of mwc  656 is approximately half of the one measured for cxou-1 .",
    "there is no reported evidence for this source in the literature and the low number of photons prevents us from clearly establishing its nature .",
    "we have tested if the _ chandra _ data for the two sources produces a spectrum that needs a two - component model .",
    "we have combined the spectra of the two sources and find that the data can be reproduced with a single power law with a photon index of @xmath39 ( @xmath34-statistic 3.7 ) .",
    "therefore , the _ chandra _ data do not support the two - component model reported in @xcite .",
    "mwc  656 was observed with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) on 2015 july 25 from 05:00 to 11:00  utc ( during the _ chandra _ observation ) in the a configuration .",
    "the observation was conducted at 10  ghz , with full circular polarization , using 32 spectral windows with 64 channels of 2  mhz bandwidth each , providing a total bandwidth of 4  ghz .",
    "the amplitude calibrator was 3c  48 .",
    "the phase calibrator j2255 + 4202 was observed in 1:20-min runs interleaved with 6-min runs on the target source .",
    "the calibration was conducted using version 4.5.0 of the casa package of nrao @xcite .",
    "the data have been reduced using standard amplitude and phase calibration steps .",
    "we imaged the data using the clean procedure with a natural weighting , obtaining a synthesized beam of @xmath40 in a position angle ( p.a . ) of 47@xmath41 ( north to east ) .",
    "due to the proximity of a bright quasar affecting the field of mwc  656 ( see @xcite ) , we imaged a region of a few arcmin including this quasar .",
    "we conducted a multi - scale clean , considering the usual point - like components and extended components with sizes one to three times the synthesized beam ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) . to check the reliability of the obtained results we also analyzed the data using standard clean , different weighting schemes , and different time intervals , which always led to compatible results within uncertainties .",
    "the obtained image is shown in figure  [ fig : vla_image ] . a faint radio source with a peak flux density of @xmath8  @xmath9jy  beam@xmath3",
    "is detected at the optical position of mwc  656 within uncertainties .",
    "although this is a marginal detection , there are several facts that support the reality of the radio source as the counterpart of mwc  656 : 1 ) it is the brightest radio source in the image , 2 ) it is the only one located within the _ chandra _ x - ray source position uncertainty , 3 ) it is fully compatible with the optical position , and 4 ) there is a former radio detection of mwc  656 @xcite .",
    "inspection at the position of cxou-1 reveals no radio counterpart , with a 3@xmath11 flux density upper limit of 3.2  @xmath9jy for a point - like source .",
    "mwc  656 was observed with different optical facilities to obtain contemporaneous photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "photometric observations were conducted with a passband optical filter at the 0.5  m robotic telescope fabra roa montsec ( tfrm , @xcite ) on the nights from 2015 july 22 to 27 ( except the 24 ) , and with @xmath42 filters at the 0.8  m robotic joan or telescope ( tjo , @xcite ) from 2015 july 28 onwards .",
    "both telescopes are located at observatori astronmic del montsec ( oadm , sant esteve de la sarga , catalonia ) . while detailed results will be published elsewhere , during the _",
    "chandra_/vla observation mwc  656 displayed photometry compatible with its already known behavior @xcite",
    ". inspection of focused images taken on 2015 november 12 reveals no optical counterpart for cxou-1 , implying @xmath43  mag .",
    "mwc  656 was also observed with the fiber - fed stella echelle spectrograph ( ses ) of the 1.2  m robotic stella - i ( st ) optical telescope @xcite at the observatorio del teide ( ot , tenerife , spain ) on the nights of 2125 july 2015 ( except the 22 ) . the setup and the data reduction were the same as in @xcite .",
    "the spectra show the presence of the double peaked @xmath104686 emission line with an equivalent width comparable to that reported in @xcite .",
    "we also detect other emission lines , mainly h@xmath44 , h@xmath45 and weak lines with comparable strengths to those measured by @xcite .",
    "therefore , mwc  656 was in a similar optical state as in past observations .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation of mwc  656 reported here has revealed that the _ xmm - newton _ source presented in @xcite was in fact the superposition of two sources : mwc  656 and the new source cxou  j224257.9 + 444307 ( cxou-1 ) .",
    "here mwc  656 is significantly fainter than it was in the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the vla observation of mwc  656 has led to the detection of a faint source .",
    "this is the first simultaneous x - ray / radio detection of the first be / bh binary system .",
    "here we discuss the implications of these detections .",
    "first , it is worth noting that during the _",
    "chandra_/vla observation mwc  656 was showing optical photometric and spectroscopic properties compatible with those reported in previous works , indicating that there was no significant change in either the be star and its circumstellar disk or the outer part of the bh accretion disk ( emission line ) .",
    "in addition , inspection of the _ maxi _ data @xcite in the direction of agl  j2241 + 4454 reveals no x - ray emission up to now ( 2009 august to 2016 october ) .",
    "therefore , mwc  656 appears to have been in a long quiescent x - ray state , at least during the last 7 years .",
    "the x - ray flux of mwc  656 provided by _",
    "chandra _ in 2015 july is @xmath35  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 in the 0.58  kev energy range . for comparison , the previous x - ray observation conducted with _",
    "xmm - newton _ in 2013 june provided a total flux of @xmath46  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 in the 0.35.5  kev energy range , which translates into @xmath47  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 in the 0.58  kev energy range .",
    "this flux is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the one measured for mwc  656 with _",
    "chandra_. however , the _ xmm - newton _ source was the superposition of two sources . assuming that cxou-1 had a constant flux of @xmath48  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 in the 0.58  kev energy range ( as determined from the _ chandra _ data ) , the corresponding flux of mwc  656 at the time of the _ xmm - newton _ observation was @xmath49  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3 in the same energy range .",
    "this would indicate a decrease of a factor of @xmath177 in the x - ray flux of mwc  656 between 2013 june and 2015 july .    considering a distance of @xmath15  kpc to mwc  656 @xcite , the _ chandra _ x - ray luminosity of the source in the 0.58  kev energy range is @xmath50  erg  s@xmath3 ( including the flux and distance uncertainties ) . considering a bh mass in the range of 3.86.9  m@xmath5 this translates into @xmath51  @xmath7 . in the 110  kev energy range",
    "these values are : @xmath52  erg  s@xmath3 = @xmath53  @xmath7 .",
    "these luminosities and the obtained photon index are fully compatible with a bh in deep quiescence @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous vla observation of mwc  656 has yielded a detection with a peak flux density of @xmath8  @xmath9jy  beam@xmath3 .",
    "the accreting bh in mwc  656 could easily produce it through synchrotron emitting electrons in a jet , as seen in many x - ray binaries ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , the production of such flux density by gyro - synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field of the be star would require too high magnetic fields combined with relatively high electron densities above the energy threshold of 10  kev @xcite .",
    "therefore , in what follows we consider that the detected radio emission in mwc  656 has a synchrotron origin in a jet .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : correlation ] the radio versus x - ray luminosity diagram for bh x - ray binaries . the simultaneous _ chandra_/vla observation of mwc  656 allows us to place the source within the diagram in a reliable way .",
    "mwc  656 is one of the faintest stellar - mass bhs ever detected in x - rays , together with , , , , , and , @xcite , and the faintest one in x - rays also detected in radio .",
    "the obtained luminosities for this quiescent bh hmxb are fully compatible with those of the x - ray / radio correlations derived from quiescent bh lmxbs at the low - luminosity end . together with cygnus  x-1 at the high - luminosity end",
    ", it is now clear , for the first time , that the accretion / ejection coupling in stellar - mass bhs is independent of the nature of the donor star .",
    "finally , given the x - ray variability found in mwc  656 , future simultaneous x - ray / radio observations should allow us to trace the motion of the source in the radio versus x - ray luminosity diagram , and directly check the slope of the correlation at the low - luminosity end for the first time in hmxbs .",
