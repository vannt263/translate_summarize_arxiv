    "phase field models are a successful approach for interface evolution in cases where interfacial energy is important , and many numerical approaches for the underlying equations have been studied in the literature . however , in situations where anisotropy is incorporated only very few results related to the numerical analysis of approximations to the phase field system have appeared in the literature .",
    "the reason for this is that the underlying equations involve highly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations .",
    "since phase field models describe very unstable solidification phenomena , it seems to be very important to use stable approximation schemes which do not trigger additional instabilities resulting from discretization errors . in this context",
    "we would like to mention that there exist many computations on anisotropic solidification , with the help of phase field equations , showing pattern formation which is driven by the discretization rather than by the underlying partial differential equations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to introduce and analyze a new stable finite element approximation for the anisotropic phase field system .",
    "the approach is based on earlier work for the allen  cahn and the cahn ",
    "hilliard equations , see @xcite , and on ideas on how to handle the anisotropy that have been used earlier for sharp interface models by the same authors , see @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", the introduced finite element approximation is the first unconditionally stable approximation of a phase field model for anisotropic solidification in the literature .    as the phase field model and its quasi - stationary variant , the viscous cahn  hilliard equation ,",

    "relevant for our considerations is the first variation , @xmath25 , of ( [ eq : egamma ] ) , which can be computed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the tangential divergence of @xmath28 , see e.g.@xcite .",

    "we only mention here that the phase field method is based on the idea of a diffuse interface , which hence has a positive thickness .",
    "let us briefly discuss some relevant literature . for solidification",
    "the phase field method was originally proposed by @xcite as a model for solidification of a pure substance .",
    "it was @xcite who first was able to simulate complicated dendritic patterns which resemble those appearing during solidification . since then an enormous effort has gone into numerically studying phase field models .",
    "we refer only to @xcite and to the reviews @xcite .    a phase field model , and its numerical approximation , for the sharp interface problem ( [ eq:1a]e ) with @xmath71 and @xmath82 has been considered in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors were able to present unconditionally stable finite element approximations , where the treatment of the anisotropy does not lead to new nonlinearities compared to the isotropic situation .",
    "it is one of the aims of the present article to extend the discretizations in @xcite to the more general problem ( [ eq:1a]e ) , i.e.  in particular to the case @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , and to a wider class of anisotropies than considered in @xcite .",
    "the new anisotropies considered in the present article will lead to more nonlinear schemes , however .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we state the two phase field models for the approximation of the sharp interface problem ( [ eq:1a]e ) that we want to consider in this paper . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we introduce our finite element approximations for these problems , and we prove stability results for these approximations .",
    "solution methods for the discrete equations are shortly reviewed in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "in addition , we present several numerical experiments in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "phase field models are a computational tool to compute approximations for sharp interface evolutions such as ( [ eq:1a]e ) , without having to capture the sharp interface @xmath18 directly .",
    "on introducing a phase field @xmath85 , where the sets @xmath86 are approximations to @xmath87 , a system of partial differential equations for @xmath1 can be derived so that the zero level sets of @xmath1 formally approximate the interface @xmath18 , satisfying e.g.  ( [ eq:1a]e ) , in a well defined limit . for more details on phase field methods and other approaches to the approximation of the evolution of interfaces we refer to the review article @xcite and the references therein .    on introducing the small interfacial parameter @xmath88 , it can be shown that @xmath89 for @xmath90 sufficiently small , where @xmath91 here @xmath92 $ ] is a double well potential , which for simplicity we assume to be symmetric and to have its global minima at @xmath93 .",
    "the canonical example is @xmath94 another possibility is to choose @xmath95 see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "clearly the obstacle potential ( [ eq : obstacle ] ) , which forces @xmath1 to stay within the interval @xmath96 $ ] , is not differentiable at @xmath93 .",
    "hence , whenever we write @xmath97 in the case ( [ eq : obstacle ] ) in this paper , we mean that the expression holds only for @xmath98 , and that in general a variational inequality needs to be employed . while it can be shown that the asymptotic interface thickness in phase field models with ( [ eq : eg ] ) for the isotropic surface energy ( [ eq : iso ] ) is proportional to @xmath90 , for anisotropic energy densities the asymptotic interface thickness is no longer uniform , but now also depends on @xmath8 and on @xmath99 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we remark that other , non - classical , phase field models are based on the energy @xmath100 for e.g.  the smooth double - well potential ( [ eq : quartic ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "the energy ( [ eq : tl ] ) has the advantage that the asymptotic interface thickness is now only determined by @xmath90 ( independently of @xmath8 and the orientation of the interface ) , whereas the disadvantage is that the resultant partial differential equations become more nonlinear and are singular at @xmath101 .",
    "we note that higher order regularizations of the energies ( [ eq : eg ] ) and ( [ eq : tl ] ) in the case of a non - convex anisotropy density function @xmath8 , which lead to sixth order cahn ",
    "hilliard type equations , have been considered in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any numerical analysis for discretizations of anisotropic phase field models for ( [ eq:1a]e ) involving either ( [ eq : eg ] ) or ( [ eq : tl ] ) .",
    "we now state the two phase field models that we are going to consider in this paper . to this end , for @xmath102 , let @xmath103 and define @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a constant satisfying @xmath106 .",
    "a phase field model for ( [ eq:1a]e ) with @xmath107 has been recently studied by the authors in @xcite . the case @xmath108 and @xmath13 gives rise to the following viscous cahn  hilliard equation for the anisotropic ginzburg ",
    "landau energy ( [ eq : eg ] ) , where @xmath2 is a phase field approximation to the ( rescaled ) temperature @xmath38 :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 with the help of formal asymptotics , see e.g.@xcite , it can be shown that the sharp interface limit of ( [ eq : cha]f ) , i.e.  the limit as @xmath111 , is given by the quasi - static stefan problem ( or mullins  sekerka problem ) ( [ eq:1a]e ) with @xmath108 , and with @xmath38 denoting the sharp interface limit of @xmath2 .",
    "we remark that the phase field analogue of the sharp interface energy identity ( [ eq : testd ] ) in the case @xmath112 is given by the formal energy bound @xmath113 for the phase field model ( [ eq : cha]f ) with the potential ( [ eq : obstacle ] ) . for smooth potentials such as ( [ eq : quartic ] ) the energy law ( [ eq : pflyap ] ) holds with equality .",
    "the second phase field model is based on the work in @xcite , see also @xcite for other related approaches , and allows the sharp interface limit ( [ eq:1a]e ) with @xmath9 .",
    "it consists of a heat equation for the phase field temperature approximation @xmath2 coupled to an allen  cahn phase field equation for @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we have the modified heat equation    @xmath114    where @xmath14 is defined in ( [ eq : b ] ) , and where the function @xmath115 is such that @xmath116\\,,\\quad \\int^1_{-1 } \\varrho(y ) \\ ; { \\rm d}y = 1 \\quad \\text{and } \\quad { { \\rm p}}(s ) : = \\int^s_{-1 } \\varrho(y ) \\ ; { \\rm d}y\\,.\\ ] ] we note that @xmath117 , which is a monotonically increasing function over the interval @xmath96 $ ] with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , is often called the interpolation function . in this paper",
    ", we follow the convention from @xcite , where @xmath120 is called the shape function .",
    "more details on interpolation functions @xmath117 , respectively shape functions @xmath6 , can be found in e.g.@xcite .",
    "in particular , if one also assumes symmetry , i.e.@xmath121\\,,\\ ] ] then a faster convergence of the phase field model to the sharp interface limit , as @xmath111 , can be shown on prescribing suitable first order corrections in @xmath90 for the remaining phase field parameters ; see @xcite for details .",
    "possible choices of @xmath6 that will be considered in this paper are @xmath122 the heat equation ( [ eq : heata]d ) is coupled to the following modified allen ",
    "cahn equation :    @xmath123    we remark that the phase field analogue of the sharp interface energy identity ( [ eq : testd ] ) is given by the formal energy bound @xmath124 for the phase field model ( [ eq : heata]d ) , ( [ eq : aca]c ) with the potential ( [ eq : obstacle ] ) . for smooth potentials such as",
    "( [ eq : quartic ] ) the energy law ( [ eq : pf2lyap ] ) holds with equality .",
    "we remark that the energy decay in ( [ eq : pf2lyap ] ) for the phase field model ( [ eq : heata]d ) , ( [ eq : aca]c ) means that the model can be said to be thermodynamically consistent . for more details on",
    "thermodynamically consistent phase field models we refer to e.g.@xcite .",
    "[ rem : one ] we remark that in the special case @xmath108 , and if we choose ( [ eq : varrho])(i ) , then clearly ( [ eq : heata]d ) , ( [ eq : aca]c ) collapses to the system ( [ eq : cha]f ) . similarly , the energy law ( [ eq : pf2lyap ] ) in this case collapses to ( [ eq : pflyap ] ) . hence from now on in this paper , we will only consider the more general model ( [ eq : heata]d ) , ( [ eq : aca]c ) . finally we note that the phase field model ( [ eq : cha]f ) in the case @xmath125 was recently considered in @xcite .",
    "we observe that for @xmath90 small , on recalling that the thickness of the interfacial region goes to zero as @xmath111 , it holds that @xmath126 which is a consequence of the fact that @xmath127 approximates the characteristic function of the liquid phase @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eq : pf2lyap ] ) and ( [ eq : pterm ] ) that for negative values of @xmath76 , @xmath1 is encouraged to take on negative values , so that the approximate liquid region @xmath128 shrinks , whereas positive values of @xmath76 encourage @xmath1 to take on positive values , so that the liquid region grows . of course",
    ", this is simply the phase field analogue of the sharp interface behaviour induced by ( [ eq : testd ] ) . a side effect of the interpolation function @xmath117 in ( [ eq : pf2lyap ] )",
    ", however , is that the function @xmath129 need no longer have local minima at @xmath130 .",
    "this can result , for example , in undesired , artificial boundary layers for strong supercoolings , i.e.  when @xmath131 is large ; see also remarks  [ rem : bl ] and [ rem : sbl ] below . for smooth potentials @xmath4 , sufficient conditions for @xmath132 to be local minimum points of @xmath133 are @xmath134 , which is evidently satisfied by ( [ eq : varrho])(iii ) .",
    "in fact , in applications phase field models for solidification almost exclusively use the quartic potential ( [ eq : quartic ] ) together with this shape function ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "for the obstacle potential ( [ eq : obstacle ] ) the situation is similar , although there is more flexibility in the possible choices of @xmath6 . in particular , here a sufficient condition for @xmath133 to have local minima at @xmath132 is given by @xmath135 clearly , ( [ eq : obstcond ] ) is always satisfied for ( [ eq : varrho])(iii ) , while for @xmath136 it is sufficient to require @xmath137 , e.g.  by choosing ( [ eq : varrho])(ii ) .",
    "a major advantage of ( [ eq : varrho])(ii ) over ( [ eq : varrho])(iii ) is that for the former it will be possible to derive almost linear finite element approximations that are unconditionally stable . the corresponding unconditionally stable schemes for the nonlinear shape function ( [ eq : varrho])(iii ) , on the other hand , turn out to be more nonlinear .",
    "conversely , if @xmath138 , then only @xmath139 is needed in order to satisfy ( [ eq : obstcond ] ) .",
    "the natural analogue for ( [ eq : varrho])(ii ) in this situation is then @xmath140 and once again it is possible to derive almost linear finite element approximations that are unconditionally stable for this choice of @xmath6 .",
    "finally we note that the quartic potential ( [ eq : quartic ] ) is often preferred in applications because the discretized equations can then be solved with smooth solution methods , such as the newton method . however , the quartic potential has the disadvantage that a priori it can not be guaranteed that @xmath141 at all times , and in practice it can in general be observed that discretizations of @xmath1 exceed the interval @xmath96 $ ] . hence from a practical and from a numerical analysis point of view",
    "it is preferable to use the obstacle potential ( [ eq : obstacle ] ) .",
    "here we note that the discretized equations , which feature variational inequalities , can be efficiently solved with a variety of modern solution methods ; see e.g.   @xcite .      in this paper , we will only consider smooth and convex anisotropies , i.e.they satisfy @xmath142 which , on recalling ( [ eq : homo ] ) , is equivalent to @xmath143    it is the aim of this paper to introduce unconditionally stable finite element approximations for the phase field models ( [ eq : cha]f ) and ( [ eq : heata]d ) , ( [ eq : aca]c ) .",
    "based on earlier work by the authors in the context of the parametric approximation of anisotropic geometric evolution equations @xcite , the crucial idea here is to restrict the class of anisotropies under consideration .",
    "the special structure of the chosen anisotropies can then be exploited to develop discretizations that are stable without the need for regularization and without a restriction on the time step size .",
    "in particular , the class of anisotropies that we will consider in this paper is given by @xmath144^r\\right)^{\\frac1r } , \\quad \\gamma_\\ell({}{p}):= [ { { } { p}\\,.\\,g_{\\ell}\\,{}{p}}]^\\frac12\\ , , \\qquad \\forall\\ { } p \\in { { \\mathbb r}}^d\\,,\\qquad r \\in [ 1,\\infty)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath145 , for @xmath146 , are symmetric and positive definite matrices .",
    "this class of anisotropies has been previously considered by the authors in @xcite .",
    "we remark that anisotropies of the form ( [ eq : g ] ) are always strictly convex norms .",
    "in particular , they satisfy ( [ eq : convex ] ) . however , despite this seemingly restrictive choice , it is possible with ( [ eq : g ] ) to model and approximate a wide variety of anisotropies that are relevant in materials science . for the sake of brevity , we refer to the exemplary wulff shapes in the authors previous papers @xcite .",
    "we remark that in the case @xmath147 all of the numerical schemes introduced in section  [ sec:3 ] , below , will feature no additional nonlinearities compared to the isotropic case ( [ eq : iso ] ) .",
    "in particular , the finite element approximation in section  [ sec:31 ] for the obstacle potential ( [ eq : obstacle ] ) will feature only linear equations and linear variational inequalities ; see also @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that in the two - dimensional case ( @xmath148 ) , the anisotropies ( [ eq : g ] ) with the choice @xmath147 adequately approximate most relevant anisotropies .",
    "however , in the three - dimensional setting ( @xmath149 ) , it is often necessary to use @xmath150 in ( [ eq : g ] ) in order to model a chosen anisotropy .",
    "see @xcite for more details .    in the following ,",
    "we establish some crucial results for anisotropies of the form ( [ eq : g ] ) . note that for @xmath8 satisfying ( [ eq : g ] ) it holds that @xmath151^{r-1 }",
