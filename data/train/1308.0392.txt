    "it is a challenging problem to search for such cluster gas states in other nuclei .",
    "for instance , possibility of @xmath2 cluster gas states in @xmath12 nuclei up to @xmath13ca was discussed in the systematic study with a non - microscopic cluster model , which suggested that @xmath2 cluster gases may appear in the energy region near the corresponding @xmath14-@xmath2 break - up threshold consistently to the ikeda threshold rule@xcite .",
    "cluster gas states including non-@xmath2 clusters or those around a core nucleus were also suggested in excited states of @xmath15b , @xmath11he and @xmath16be@xcite .",

    "it is also an interesting problem to assign band members of the cluster gas state to clarify the property of the cluster gas , especially , stability against rotation as discussed in refs .",

    "@xmath0o is a double closed - shell nuclei and its ground state is dominated by @xmath19-shell closed configuration , while there exist many excited states that are difficult to be described by a simple shell model .",
    "semi - microscopic and microscopic @xmath1c+@xmath2 cluster models @xcite were applied to study excited states of @xmath0o and it has been shown that many excited states can be described by @xmath1c+@xmath2 cluster structures .",
    "for instance , in the calculation with the @xmath1c+@xmath2 orthogonality condition model ( ocm ) @xcite , a semi - microscopic cluster model @xcite , the @xmath3 state of @xmath0o and its rotational band members , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states , are described by the cluster state having the dominant @xmath1c(@xmath6)+@xmath2 component . moreover , the @xmath0o(@xmath20 ) state is considered to mainly have the @xmath1c(@xmath4)+@xmath2 component .",
    "these results are supported also by 4@xmath2-ocm calculations @xcite .",

    "the large occupation probability of 4 @xmath2 particles in the same @xmath25 and low - momentum orbit was demonstrated by the analysis of the 4@xmath2-ocm wave function .    in spite of the success of those calculations with the semi - microscopic cluster models such as the @xmath1c+@xmath2-ocm and the @xmath8-ocm , there is no microscopic calculation that can reproduce the excitation energies of the cluster states in @xmath0o .",

    "the binding energy of @xmath1c was improved because of the energy gain of the spin - orbit force due to the mixing of @xmath28-shell configurations .",

    "the wave function @xmath39 is written by a slater determinant of single - particle wave functions @xmath40 , each of which is given by a product of the spatial ( @xmath41 ) , the intrinsic spin(@xmath42 ) , and isospin(@xmath43 ) functions . the isospin function fixed to be up ( proton ) or down ( neutron ) .",
    "the spatial part @xmath41 is written by the gaussian wave packet localized around the position @xmath44 in the phase space .",

    "<S> cluster structures and monopole transitions in positive parity states of @xmath0o were investigated based on the generator coordinate method calculation of an extended @xmath1c+@xmath2 cluster model . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath3 state of @xmath0o and its rotational members , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states are described well by the cluster states dominated by the @xmath1c(@xmath6)+@xmath2 structure . above the @xmath1c(@xmath3)+@xmath2 threshold energy </S>",
