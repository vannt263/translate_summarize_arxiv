    "<S> the measurement of quantum entanglement in many - body systems remains challenging . </S>",
    "<S> one experimentally relevant fact about quantum entanglement is that in systems whose degrees of freedom map to free fermions with conserved total particle number , exact relations hold relating the full counting statistics associated with the bipartite charge fluctuations and the sequence of r ' enyi entropies . </S>",
    "<S> we draw a correspondence between the bipartite charge fluctuations and the entanglement spectrum , mediated by the r ' enyi entropies . in the case of the integer quantum hall effect , </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to reproduce the generic features of the entanglement spectrum from a measurement of the second charge cumulant only . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , asking whether it is possible to extend the free fermion result to the @xmath0 fractional quantum hall case , we provide numerical evidence that the answer is negative in general . </S>",
    "<S> we further address the problem of quantum hall edge states described by a luttinger liquid , and derive expressions for the spectral functions of the real space entanglement spectrum at a quantum point contact realized in a quantum hall sample . </S>"
