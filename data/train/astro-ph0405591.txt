    "global pulsations in white dwarf stars provide the only current systematic way to study their interiors .",
    "hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs ( das ) exhibit nonradial g - mode pulsations , and are known as da variables ( davs ) or zz  ceti stars .",
    "bergeron et al . ( 1995 , 2004 ) and koester & allard ( 2000 ) find these pulsators confined in the range 11000k and 12500k for @xmath1 .",
    "during the course of a 15 month long search , mukadam et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter paper - i ) discovered 35 new zz  ceti stars within the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "this is the first time in the history of white dwarf asteroseismology that we have a statistically significant homogeneous set of zz  ceti spectra , acquired entirely with the same detection system , namely the sdss spectrograph on the 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "all the spectra have been reduced and analyzed consistently using the same set of model atmospheres and fitting algorithms , including the observed photometric colors ( see kleinman et al .",
    "this homogeneity should reduce the relative scatter of the variables in the @xmath2@xmath3 plane , and possibly allow us to see emerging new features .",
    "the sample size of known davs is now almost twice as large since the last characterization of the instability strip by bergeron et al .",
    "however , we will not include the previously known davs in our analysis with the exception of g238 - 53 , as these pulsators do not have sdss spectra and will only serve to reduce the homogeneity of our sample .",
    "we list the @xmath2 and @xmath3 values of all the variables and non - variables we discovered within the sdss data in paper - i , along with their internal uncertainties .",
    "note that we will not be considering wd2350@xmath40054 in this paper as it may be a unique pulsator ; it shows pulsation periods and pulse shapes characteristic of the hot dav stars , while the sdss temperature determination places it below the cool edge of the instability strip .",
    "we focus on the general trends of the majority of the davs , and hence a discussion of wd2350@xmath40054 is postponed to a future date .",
    "we will not be including wd1443@xmath40054 either , as its temperature and @xmath3 determinations are unreliable due to a missing portion in its sdss spectrum .",
    "we will be including g238 - 53 , the only previously known zz  ceti star with a published sdss spectrum .",
    "we show the empirical sdss instability strip in figure 1 , as determined by 30 new zz  ceti stars and g238 - 53 . we plot histograms of the observed variables as a function of temperature and @xmath3 , and weighted histograms ( see section 2.2 ) for the non - variables ( not observed to vary ; novs ) .",
    "figure 1 has two striking features : a narrow strip of width 950k and non - variable da white dwarfs within the instability strip .",
    "pulsations are believed to be an evolutionary effect in otherwise normal white dwarfs ( robinson 1979 ; fontaine et al .",
    "1985 ; fontaine et al . 2003 ; bergeron et al . 2004 ) .",
    "non - variables in the middle of the strip question this semi - empirical premise , even if we use the uncertainties in temperature to justify the non - variables close to the edges .",
    "we also note that the dav distribution appears to be non - uniform across the strip .",
    "the features of this plot are influenced by various factors such as biases in candidate selection , non - uniform detection efficiency in the @xmath2@xmath3 plane , and uncertainties as well as systematic effects in spectroscopic temperature and @xmath3 determinations .",
    "we address these issues and their effects on the dav distribution in the next few sub - sections .",
    "we selected sdss dav candidates for high - speed photometry from those spectroscopically identified da white dwarfs that lie in the temperature range 1100012500k .",
    "these temperature fits are derived by our sdss collaborators using the spectral fitting technique outlined in kleinman et al .",
    "paper - i gives a discussion of other candidate selection methods used in our search for zz  ceti stars prior to the spectral fitting technique .",
    "our various science goals lead to some biases in selecting dav candidates for observation .",
    "the hot dav ( hdav ) stars exhibit extreme amplitude and frequency stability ( e.g. kepler et al . 2000a",
    "; mukadam et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we plan to search for reflex motion caused by orbiting planets around such stable pulsators ( e.g. kepler et al .",
    "1991 ; mukadam , winget , & kepler 2001 ; winget et al .",
    "these stable clocks drift at their cooling rate ; measuring the drift rate in the absence of orbital companions allows us to calibrate our evolutionary models .",
    "these models are useful in determining ages of the galactic disk and halo using white dwarfs as chronometers ( e.g. winget et al .",
    "1987 ; hansen et al .",
    "therefore , we preferentially choose to observe hdav candidates in the range 1170012300k to increase the sample of known stable pulsators with both the above objectives in mind .",
    "this bias is partially compensated for , as hdavs are harder to find ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "we also preferentially observe dav candidates of extreme masses .",
    "low mass ( @xmath5 ) davs could well be helium core white dwarfs ; pulsating he core white dwarfs should allow us to probe their equation of state .",
    "high mass ( @xmath6 ) davs are potentially crystallized ( winget et al . 1997 ; montgomery & winget 1999 ) , providing a test of the theory of crystallization in stellar plasma .",
    "metcalfe , montgomery , & kanaan ( 2004 ) present strong evidence that the massive dav , bpm37093 , is 90% crystallized .",
    "the distribution of _ chosen _ dav candidates also depends on the distribution of _ available _ dav candidates .",
    "we have an additional bias due to the sdss criteria in choosing candidates for spectroscopy . but a histogram of the available dav candidates is consistent with a random distribution and does not reflect any systematic effects .",
    "the non - uniform nature of the dav distribution does not appear to be a candidate selection effect .",
    "however , we are in the domain of small number statistics since we observed only four dav candidates in the range 1135011500k . of these , two are massive and consequently expected to be low amplitude pulsators ( see section 2.2 ) , making detection difficult .",
    "our data are suggestive of a bimodal dav distribution in temperature .",
    "we hope to investigate this issue further by observing additional dav candidates in the range 1135011500k with our collaborators .",
    "the hdavs show relatively few pulsation modes , with low amplitudes ( @xmath00.13% ) and periods around 100300s .",
    "the cooler davs ( cdavs ) typically show longer periods , around 6001000s , larger amplitudes ( up to 30% ) , and greater amplitude variability ( kleinman et al . 1998 ) .",
    "massive pulsators show low amplitudes as a result of their high gravity ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these distinct trends of the pulsation periods and amplitudes with temperature and @xmath3 imply that the detection efficiency must also be a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the detection efficiency not only varies in the @xmath2@xmath3 plane , but is also dependent upon weather conditions and the magnitude of the dav candidate .",
    "furthermore , a zz  ceti star may have closely spaced modes or multiplet structure , both of which cause beating effects .",
    "some of the non - variables in the instability strip could well be pulsators , that were in the low amplitude phase of their beating cycle during the observing run .",
    "mcgraw ( 1977 ) claimed bpm37093 to be non - variable , but kanaan et al .",
    "( 1992 ) showed that it is a low amplitude variable with evident beating .",
    "dolez , vauclair , & koester ( 1991 ) claimed the non - variability limit of g30 - 20 to be a few mmag , but mukadam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found g30 - 20 to be a beating variable with an amplitude of 13.8mma .    in order to address these issues systematically ,",
    "we simulate light curves of real pulsators for different conditions and compute the resulting fourier transform ( ft ) to see if the signal is detectable above noise .",
    "we utilize the real periods and amplitudes , with randomly chosen phases ( to sample the beat period ) , to simulate two hour long light curves .",
    "we independently shuffle the magnitudes and average seeing conditions of real data on the davs .",
    "this ensures a realistic distribution for both these parameters .",
    "we randomly select a magnitude and seeing value from these distributions to simulate white noise , the amplitude of which is determined using a noise table based on real data .",
    "we compute a ft of the light curve and check if the star can be identified as a pulsator or if the signal was swamped by noise .",
    "we repeat this procedure 100 times for each dav for different phases , magnitudes , and seeing values .",
    "note that our noise simulation is not completely realistic , as it does not include effects due to variable seeing , gaps in the data due to clouds , and low frequency atmospheric noise .",
    "however , it does help us understand how the detection efficiency changes in the @xmath2@xmath3 plane .",
    "we find that we are able to _ rediscover _ almost all of the average and low mass cdavs in the hundred simulated attempts .",
    "the high mass ( @xmath7 ) davs with a substantially lower amplitude are recovered with a @xmath070% success rate .",
    "this implies that non - variables in figure 1 in the region @xmath7 have a 30% chance of being low amplitude variables . at the hot end of the instability strip ,",
    "both low pulsation amplitude and beating can cause us to miss even the average or low mass hdavs 35 out of 100 times .",
    "table 1 lists the non - variables in the instability strip along with their temperature , @xmath3 , magnitude , and number of observing runs .",
    "the number after the nov designation indicates the best non - variability limit in mma . based on the simulations",
    ", we assign each non - variable a weight based on our estimate of the probability that the observed candidate is a genuine non - variable , and not a low - amplitude or beating pulsator .",
    "we use the non - variability limits to assign the weights 0.98 , 0.95 , 0.90 , 0.85 , 0.80 , 0.70 , and 0.60 , for nov1 , nov2 , nov3 , nov4 , nov5 , nov6 , and nov7 or higher , respectively .",
    "if the nov is massive ( @xmath88.6 ) , then we additionally multiply its weight by a factor of 0.7 .",
    "if the nov is close to the blue edge of the strip , then we multiply by a factor of 0.65 to account for low amplitude and/or beating pulsators .",
    "however if the nov has been observed multiple times , then it is unlikely to have been missed as a result of beating . in such a case ,",
    "we multiply its weight only by a factor of 0.8 instead of 0.65 , to allow for a possible low amplitude variable .",
    "we utilize these weights in section 6 to compute best - fit red and blue edges .",

    "temperature is mainly determined by the continuum and the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 lines ; the low s / n at the blue end of the sdss spectra has a reduced effect on temperature determinations .",
    "the well calibrated continuum , extending from 38009200 provides an accurate temperature determination .",
    "the gradual change in mean mass as a function of temperature for the sdss da white dwarf fits is addressed in kleinman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and figure 7 of their paper shows a quantitative measure of this systematic effect .",
    "the increase in @xmath3 across the width of the instability strip is only @xmath54 , and implies that our determinations of cdav masses are negligibly higher .",
    "these systematic effects are small in the range of the zz ceti instability strip , and can not produce either the narrow width or the impurity of the observed strip .",
    "we conduct a simple monte carlo simulation to estimate the internal @xmath2 uncertainties of our ensemble . using the observed pulsation characteristics , we can separate the davs into two classes : hdavs and cdavs ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "we show the observed distribution of the hdavs and cdavs in the lowest panel of figure 2 .",
    "these distributions are distinct , except for 3 objects . based on the empirical picture",
    ", we conceive that the underlying dav distribution may look similar to that shown in the topmost panel of figure 2 .",
    "we perform a monte carlo simulation , drawing hdavs and cdavs randomly from the expected dav distribution , and using gaussian uncertainties with @xmath55k .",
    "we show the resulting distribution in the second panel ; the large uncertainties cause significant overlap between the cdavs and hdavs , swamping the central gap .",
    "we perform a similar simulation with @xmath56200k ( third panel ) , and it compares well with the observed distribution considering the small numbers of the empirical distribution .",
    "this suggests that the internal uncertainties in effective temperature for our ensemble are @xmath57200k per object , provided we believe that the hdavs and cdavs each span a range of at least 300k .",
    "note that the internal uncertainties for a few individual objects maybe as large as 250300k .",
    "the mean or dominant period of a pulsator is an indicator of its effective temperature ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "this asteroseismological relation is not highly sensitive , but it provides a technique independent of spectroscopy to study the dav temperature distribution .",
    "we show the distribution of the dominant periods of the sdss davs in figure 3 .",
    "the top right panel in figure 3 shows the number of davs per period interval and is suggestive of a bimodal distribution ; this increases the likelihood that the dearth of davs near the center of the strip is real .",
    "non - variables in the instability strip imply that all da white dwarfs do not evolve in the same way .",
    "this notion has a severe implication : decoding the inner structure of a dav will no longer imply that we can use the results towards understanding da white dwarfs in general .",
    "hence we question our findings , and conduct simulations to verify our results .",
    "although we estimate the internal @xmath2 uncertainties to be at most 200k in section 2.3 , we will conservatively assume @xmath55k for all subsequent calculations .",
    "the sdss spectra do not show any evidence of a binary companion for all the non - variables within the instability strip . also , we used d. koester s model atmospheres to ascertain that the sdss algorithm had chosen a solution consistent with the photometric colors ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) in every case .",
    "we now conduct a monte carlo simulation assuming a pure instability strip enclosed by non - variables , as shown in the top panel of figure 4 .",
    "note that we have not included a @xmath3 dependence in our model , as we expect it to be a smaller effect than what we are about to demonstrate .",
    "we choose non - variables from outside the strip and add uncertainties chosen randomly from a gaussian error distribution with @xmath56300k to determine the nov distribution shown in the middle panel .",
    "we find that although non - variables leak into the strip , they are found mostly at the outer edges and their number tails off within the strip .",
    "the observed nov distribution ( bottom panel ) does not show any signs of tailing off within the instability strip .",
    "rather , it displays the same number of non - variables at the edges as in the center of the strip .",
    "this suggests that the instability strip is impure , and that all the novs within the instability strip did not leak in due to large @xmath2 uncertainties .",
    "we carried out these simulations several times to verify these results .",
    "we compute the likelihood that the instability strip is pure based on the following two criteria .",
    "there are two ways in which a non - variable can disappear from the instability strip : subsequent observations show it is a ( low amplitude ) variable or the internal uncertainties in @xmath2 prove to be large enough to allow the possibility that it may have leaked into the strip .",
    "table 1 lists our estimates of the probabilities that the novs found within the strip are genuine non - variables .",
    "the chance that novs may have leaked into the strip due to large internal uncertainties @xmath60k are : 0.35 for wd0037 + 0031 , 0.18 for wd0050 - 0023 , 0.13 for wd0303 - 0808 , 0.04 for wd0345 - 0036 , 0.25 for wd0747 + 2503 , 0.42 for wd0853 + 0005 , 0.15 for wd1031 + 6122 , 0.38 for wd1136 - 0136 , 0.31 for wd1338 - 0023 , 0.11 for wd1342 - 0159 , 0.28 for wd1345 + 0328 , 0.13 for wd1432 + 0146 , 0.25 for wd1503 - 0052 , 0.20 for wd1658 + 3638 , and 0.31 for wd1726 + 5331 .",
    "the probability that each of the above non - variables disappear from the instability strip is then : 0.48 , 0.59 , 0.26 , 0.23 , 0.33 , 0.68 , 0.28 , 0.62 , 0.41 , 0.24 , 0.50 , 0.30 , 0.36 , 0.32 , and 0.59 respectively .",
    "three or four of the above non - variables may have an inclination angle that reduces the observed amplitude below the detection threshold . instead of calculating various permutations",
    ", we will evaluate the likelihood of the worst case scenario .",
    "let four novs that have the least chance of disappearing from the instability strip be the ones that have an unsuitable inclination angle for observing pulsations . in that case ,",
    "the chance that the instability strip is pure is 0.004% .",
    "the impurity of the instability strip suggests that parameters other than just the effective temperature and @xmath3 play a crucial role in deciding the fate of a da white dwarf , i.e. , whether it will pulsate or not .",
    "computing the width of the instability strip using the effective temperatures of the hottest and coolest pulsators gives us a value , independent of our conception of the shape of the zz  ceti strip .",
    "determining whether the blue and red edges continue to be linear for very high ( @xmath61 ) or very low ( @xmath62 ) masses is presently not possible with either our sample or the bergeron et al .",

    "our present evolutionary cooling rates from such pulsators suggest that given a width of 950k , a 0.6 @xmath67 zz  ceti star may spend @xmath68yr traversing the instability strip .",
    "this agrees with theoretical calculations by wood ( 1995 ) and bradley , winget , & wood ( 1992 ) .",
    "the narrow width constrains our understanding of the evolution of zz  ceti stars .",
    "we draw blue and red edges around the dav distribution that enclose all of the variables .",
    "this is shown in figure 5 by the solid line for the blue edge and the line with dots and dashes for the red edge .",
    "these edges also include non - variables within the instability strip .",
    "we now demonstrate an innovative statistical approach to find the best - fit blue and red edges that maximize the number of variables and minimize the number of non - variables enclosed within the strip . to the best of our knowledge , no standard technique can be used to solve this interesting statistical problem .",
    "our statistical approach has two advantages : we are accounting for the uncertainties in temperature and @xmath3 values and we are utilizing most of the variables and non - variables in our determination rather than just a handful close to the edge .",
    "this problem has essentially two independent sources of uncertainties : the uncertainties in temperature and @xmath3 that shift the location of a star in the @xmath2@xmath3 plane and the uncertainty concerning the genuine nature of a non - variable .",
    "pulsators masquerading as non - variables can significantly alter our determination of the blue and red edges .",
    "hence , we assign different weights to davs and novs . since the davs are confirmed variables , we assign them a unit weight .",
    "we use the non - variability limit to decide the weight of all the novs that lie outside the empirical zz  ceti strip , as in section 2.2 , while we assign the weights listed in table 1 for novs within the instability strip .",
    "we construct a grid in @xmath2 and @xmath3 space in the respective ranges 900014000k and 6.010.5 with resolutions of 50k and 0.05 . for each point in the grid ,",
    "we consider possible blue and red edges that vary in inclination angle relative to the temperature axis from 15 degrees to 165 degrees by half a degree with each successive iteration .    for each point of the grid , and for each possible blue edge , we compute a net count as follows : davs on the cooler side of the edge count as + 1 each and on the hotter side count as @xmath41 each .",

    "this ensures that the novs close to and beyond the red edge do not influence the determination of the blue edge . if the dav or nov is within 3@xmath73 of the edge",
    ", then we determine the net chance that it lies on the hot or cool side of the edge , assuming a gaussian uncertainty distribution .",
    "we multiply this chance with the count for that object , before adding it to the total count .",
    "an effect of",
    "this choice is that the best edge is determined by the global distribution of davs and novs , rather than the few close to the edge .",
    "similarly , we determine the best red edge at each point of the grid by counting davs on the hotter side of the edge as + 1 and novs on its cooler side as @xmath69 , and vice versa .",
    "we consider all davs and novs within the instability strip and cooler than 11820k to compute the best red edge .",

    "we add these independent sources of uncertainty in quadrature to obtain an estimated 1@xmath73 uncertainty of 0.6 for the red edge and 0.4 for the blue edge .",
    "we show these as dotted lines in figure 5 .",
    "our estimates of the 1@xmath73 uncertainties clearly show that the red edge is well constrained , and the slope of the blue edge is not .",
    "note that we already account for the uncertainties in @xmath2 and @xmath3 in determining the red and blue edges .",
    "the unreliability of these uncertainties contributes towards an uncertainty in the slope of the edges ; this turns out to be a negligible second order effect .",
    "we show the empirical blue and red edges from bergeron et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in figure 5 for comparison .",
    "the slopes of the red edges from both samples agree within the uncertainties .",
    "but our constraint on the blue edge differs significantly from that of bergeron et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and suggests that the dependence on mass is less severe .",
    "the mean temperature of our sample is 11400k , while the mean temperature for the bergeron et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample is 11630k .",
    "the observed extent of our instability strip defined by 31 objects spans 1085011800k , while that of bergeron et al .",
    "( 2004 ) spans 1107012460k .",
    "we can consider these values to imply a relative shift of @xmath0200k between our sample and that of bergeron et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we would also like to point out that our sample is magnitude limited and reaches out to @xmath75 .",
    "we are effectively sampling a different population of stars , more distant by a factor of 10 , than the bergeron et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample .      in figure 5",
    ", we show the theoretical blue edge from brassard & fontaine ( 1997 ) due to the traditional radiative driving mechanism ; they use a ml2/@xmath760.6 prescription for convection in their equilibrium models .",
    "we also show the blue _ and _ red edges which we derive from the convective driving theory of wu & goldreich ( brickhill 1991 ; wu 1998 ; wu & goldreich 1999 ) , assuming ml2/@xmath760.8 for convection .",
    "we see that the blue edges of the two theories are essentially the same , and would nearly coincide if the mixing - length parameter were tuned . to obtain the red edge of wu & goldreich ,",
    "we have made the following assumptions : ( 1 ) the relative flux variation at the base of the convection zone is no larger than 50% , ( 2 ) the period of a representative red edge mode is 1000 s , and ( 3 ) the detection limit for intensity variations is 1mma .",
    "within this theory , the convection zone attenuates the flux at its base by a factor of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the thermal response time of the convection zone , so we have adjusted @xmath78 such that the surface amplitude @xmath79 , equal to the detection threshold .",
    "the observed distribution of variables and non - variables suggests that the mass dependence of the blue edge is less severe than predicted by the models .",
    "both the slope and the location of the red edge we calculate are consistent with the observed variables and non - variables within the uncertainties .",
    "using a statistically significant and truly homogeneous set of 31 zz  ceti spectra , we find a narrow instability strip between 10850k and 11800k .",
    "we also find non - variables within the strip and compute the likelihood that the instability strip is pure to be @xmath80% . obtaining higher",
    "signal - to - noise spectra of all the sdss and non - sdss davs as well as non - variables in the zz  ceti strip is crucial to improving our determination of the width and edges of the instability strip , and in investigating the purity of the instability strip .",
    "this should help constrain our understanding of pulsations in zz  ceti stars .",
    "the dav distribution shows a scarcity of davs in the range 1135011500k . after exploring various possible causes for such a bimodal , non - uniform distribution , we are still not entirely confident that it is real .",
    "the data at hand are suggestive that the non - uniformity of the dav distribution is real , and stayed hidden from us for decades due to the inhomogeneity of the spectra of the previously known davs",
    ". however , we are in the domain of small number statistics and unless we investigate additional targets in the middle of the strip , we can not be confident that the bimodal distribution is not an artifact in our data .",
