    "environment plays an important role in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "tidal interactions @xcite , galaxy harassment @xcite , removal of gas via ram pressure stripping @xcite , viscous stripping @xcite and major & minor mergers @xcite play a key role in galaxy evolution and modify their characteristics , like morphology , kinematics and star formation rates(sfr ) . while the importance of the various physical mechanisms in determining the evolution of the member galaxies is well understood in cluster environments",
    "; we are still understanding the importance of the various processes in groups of galaxies .",
    "for example , in cluster environments , it is known that ram pressure stripping is the main mechanism for stripping the galaxies of their gas near the cluster center and that harassment plays an important role in stripping the galaxies of gas mass near the outskirts and intermediate distances from the cluster center . however , while tidal interactions are believed to play a major role in group environs due to the lower relative velocities and lower igrm densities - it is not clear if this is the only major process active in group environs .",
    "one major reason for the need to look for additional physical processes which are active in group environs is the presence of morphological signatures which have traditionally been attributed to ram pressure stripping if the galaxy was located in cluster environs .",
    "for example , in the galaxies which are found embedded inside cluster environs an abrupt drop in hi column density giving rise to a smooth edge or hi depletion are believed to be caused by their motion in the medium . however , when tidal interaction is invoked to explain similar signatures observed in group members , there are difficulties in explaining all the observed features .",
    "however since such observed cases are small in number , we still have much to learn about these systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several simulations of such systems for a range of physical parameters have shown ram pressure to lead to observable signatures on the galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a study of this aspect for the poor group of late type galaxies , holmberg  124 , has been carried out by kantharia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and in the present investigation we extend it further .",
    "holmberg  124 consists of four late type galaxies - ngc  2820 , ngc  2805 , ngc  2814 and mrk  108 and has been subject of extensive study to name a few ; radio continuum observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) hi observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and photometric observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "all the galaxies show several morphological and/ or other signatures attributable to tidal interactions . besides",
    ", they show additional signatures which demand an alternative explanation such as ram pressure stripping @xcite . while the extensive hi study of the group by kantharia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) using gmrt clearly detected several tidal and ram pressure events in the galaxies ngc  2820 , ngc  2814 and mrk  108 which are referred to as triplet in rest of the paper ; owing to ngc  2805 being located close to the half power point in the gmrt primary beam during the observations ; the reduced sensitivity did not recover all the hi in the galaxy .",
    "the current data downloaded from the gmrt archives , is free from this constraint with the pointing centre being between ngc  2820 and ngc  2805 .",
    "ngc  2805 is an sd galaxy seen nearly face - on and is the brightest member in the group holmberg  124 .",
    "the hii regions in ngc  2805 appear to be distorted on the side of the galaxy opposite to the companion @xcite .",
    "hi has been detected from the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and bosma et al .",
    "( 1980 ) report that the outer hi layers are warped .",
    "a spectroscopic study of a few galaxies including ngc  2805 have been described by ganda et al .",
    "this investigation reveals that the galaxy seems to be also optically disturbed , since the spiral arms appear to be broken up into segments .",
    "they have employed sauron spectrograph and have studied the central parts of the galaxy and detect slow projected stellar velocities and a central drop in velocity dispersion .",
    "they conclude that this could be due to the lack of a classical stellar bulge and the presence of small - scale structures ( nuclear star clusters , inner rings , inner bars ) .",
    "the gas has a clumpy distribution and rotates consistently with the stars .",
    "low values of the line ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath0 are observed over the central 33 @xmath1 41 arcsec@xmath2 of the galaxy , possibly indicating ongoing star formation @xcite .",
    "boker et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have reported that the galaxy hosts a compact luminous stellar cluster in the centre and performing an analytical fit to the surface brightness profiles have obtained a size for the nuclear star cluster of 8.2 pc and an absolute i - band magnitude of -13.32 for a distance of 28.1 mpc to ngc  2805 .",
    "the h@xmath3 rotation curve studies of ngc  2805 by garrido et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reveal that it is quite regular and symmetric and reaches 70 km s@xmath4 at 30 arcsec , then rises slowly up to 85 km s@xmath4 ( beyond 120 arcsec ) .",
    "they find that on the isovelocities map , the position of the major axis is changing with radius and the approaching side rises beyond 120 arcsec up to 120 km s@xmath4 ; confirming the warps pointed out by the bosma et al .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field in ngc  2805 has been estimated to be 1.86 @xmath5 g @xcite .    in this paper , we present new hi images of the group holmberg  124 especially the almost face - on spiral member , ngc  2805 .",
    "we also present the kinematics of ngc  2805 and discuss the observed morphology .",
    "we combine our new sensitive radio continuum maps at 20 cm of the triplet with the 325 mhz maps from kantharia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and present the spectral index distribution across the triplet members .",
    "we compare the radio emission with other wavebands and comment on the evolution of the group especially the physical processes acting on ngc  2805 . based on our new images and using data from literature",
    ", we refine the model given by kantharia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for the poor group of galaxies holmberg  124 .",
    "we assume the distance of the group to be 25 mpc with the estimated velocity dispersion along the line of sight as 162@xmath673 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    ".galaxy parameters [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      +    notes : the result at 325 mhz are taken from @xcite .",
    "( a ) the flux density of ngc  2805 is estimated from the nvss 1.4 ghz image .",
    "( b ) flux density at 1.4 ghz has been estimated for ngc  2820+mrk  108 using our 1.4 ghz radio continuum map .",
    "( c ) sfr@xmath7 drive from the @xcite .",
    "( d ) since its difficult to separate the flux density of ngc  2820 and mrk  108 , the flux density and spectral index includes contribution from both the galaxies .",
    "kantharia et .",
    "al ( 2005 ) have proposed a model for holmberg  124 ; especially the triplet galaxies namely ngc  2820 , ngc  2814 and mrk  108 ; according to which both tidal and ram pressure effects are operative in this triplet galaxies and also likely for ngc  2805 .",
    "our analysis of the radio continuum and the 21 cm hi images support their scenario for the triplet .",
    "the tidal features that we detect are ( i ) the radio continuum and hi bridge connecting ngc 2820 , mrk  108 with ngc  2814 , ( ii )",
    "the streamer spatially connected to ngc  2814 but kinematically distinct from it and ( iii ) the tidal dwarf galaxy to the north - east of ngc  2820 .",
    "further , as discussed below , our analysis supports their view regarding the triplet viz .",
    ", ngc  2820 has dominant motion in the south - east and ngc 2814 to the north in the sky plane .",
    "this motion in the igrm , with a small line - of - sight component , leads to ram pressure effects leaving detectable morphological imprints on the member galaxies in the atomic hi and radio continuum emission in the sky plane .",
    "we estimate an hi deficiency of @xmath8 for ngc  2805 and @xmath9 for ngc  2820 , indicating that the two giant spirals are not hi - deficient and hence it is likely they have just started experiencing ram pressure effects which are observed as morphological signatures . for estimating the deficiency , we have used the prescription in which the hi content of a particular galaxy type",
    "is compared to the hi content in a field galaxy as given by haynes & giovanelli ( 1984 ) . for ngc  2805",
    ", we used type 4 and for ngc  2820 we used the hi content of type 5 galaxy . since we have been able to obtain better hi images of the low inclination galaxy ngc  2805 , we can comment on the physical processes which the galaxy is likely experiencing and which in turn can explain the observed hi distribution .",
    "we can explain both the sharp fall in the hi column density in the north and the star forming ridge along the spiral arm in the south due to the motion of the galaxy in the igrm .",
    "enhanced star formation is observed in the nuclear regions of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "moreover while the nir emission is predominantly centrally concentrated ; the uv and h@xmath3 emission arise from several regions in the galaxy and is especially intense in the southern spiral arm .",
    "based on all this , we suggest that ngc  2805 is moving along a direction at a small angle to the line - of - sight and tilted towards the triplet i.e. north - west .",
    "the ram pressure effects on ngc  2805 is due to an almost face - on encounter with the igrm with the northern hi arc being the leading edge .",
    "this is similar to the model given for ngc 4254 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) where almost the entire disk of the galaxy is encountering the igrm in a face - on event which leads to compression and enhanced star formation in the southern arm .",
    "the star formation in the southern spiral arm in ngc  2805 has been triggered by the large gas densities encountering the igrm .",
    "the motion of the galaxy and the subsequent ram pressure effects leads to gas being stripped out of the disk which explains the tenuous hi gas detected in the south - west .",
    "simulations e.g. @xcite where the galaxy has an face - on encounter with the igrm also show the gas being stripped off and appearing to form a gas halo around the galaxy in the sky plane . as suggested by kantharia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the motion of ngc  2820 and ngc  2814 is predominantly in the sky plane with a small line - of - sight component .",
    "this is supported by the systemic velocity of all the components .",
    "the velocities of ngc  2820 and ngc  2814 are 1574 and 1592 km  s@xmath4 respectively while the velocity of ngc  2805 is 1725 km  s@xmath4 - this supports our model that its motion is predominantly radial and receding .",
    "in this paper , we have presented new hi images of the member galaxies of the group holmberg  124 made from archival gmrt 21 cm hi data .",
    "these images confirm the results of kantharia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for the triplet consisting of the large spiral ngc  2820 and the smaller late type galaxies ngc  2814 and mrk  108 including the detection of a possible tidal dwarf galaxy and the large asymmetric hi loop seen along the minor axis in ngc  2820 .",
    "moreover , superior quality hi emission images of ngc  2805 are presented and comparison with single dish data shows that the gmrt data has recovered most of the hi mass for this galaxy with large angular size with the gmrt estimate being lower by only about 5% .",
    "ngc  2805 is a low inclination galaxy and its optical emission is characterized by a star forming ridge along a spiral arm in the south and a star forming arc in the northern part in addition to star formation throughout the galaxy .",
    "our hi column density maps show enhanced column densities in the northern arc and in the southern spiral arm with hi from the entire optical disk and diffuse hi detected beyond the southern arm .",
    "this diffuse hi shows peculiar morphology and has low velocity dispersion compared to rest of the galaxy .",
    "it also seems to be losing rotation .",
    "based on these properties , we suggest that this gas might not be co - planar to the rest of the disk emission but might be being stripped off the galaxy as it moves through the igrm . from the combined nature of the hi and optical morphologies",
    ", we suggest that ngc  2805 is showing clear signatures of ram pressure effects resulting from it motion along a direction close to the line - of - sight but tilted towards the triplet i.e. towards north - east .",
    "this is supported by the systemic velocities of the galaxies - the velocities of the triplet galaxies are similar whereas that of ngc  2805 differs from these by more than 100 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "so while the triplet have dominant motion in the sky plane , ngc  2805 has dominant motion along the line - of - sight direction .",
    "the compressed hi in the north , the star formation triggered throughout the galaxy and especially the southern spiral arm and the diffuse gas to the south of the galaxy are all explained in this model , since the entire disk of ngc  2805 would encounter the igrm .",
    "neither of the large spiral galaxies are hi deficient indicating that they are probably in the initial stages of experiencing ram pressure effects .",
    "we note that this is an interesting group of late type galaxies with one galaxy seen at high inclination and the other at low inclination allowing us to study a range of features due to ram pressure effects .",
    "we also report tentative detection of hi in the igrm in the form of small discrete clumps near ngc  2820 .",
    "the clumps near ngc  2820 are detected near the asymmetric loop and south of the triplet .",
    "we note that these features need confirmation since their detection in the gmrt data is marginal",
    ". it will be very interesting to follow up these interesting results with deep x - ray observations of the igrm and hi observations sensitive to larger angular scales .",
    "it is necessary to observe many more such groups to understand the physical mechanisms which control the evolution of the member galaxies , especially since more than 60% of all galaxies are believed to be in group environs . while tidal interactions are believed to be active in such systems ; there are increasing number of systems where ram pressure effects seem to be showing observable effects .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt who made this observations possible .",
    "the gmrt is operated by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
    "a. mishra thanks national centre for radio astrophysics for support and hospitality .",
