    "the transit of biopolymeric chains across membranes through nanopores , the _ translocation _ process , is a recurrent theme in cell biology @xcite . in biological membranes",
    "the nanopore is typically constituted by a channel protein , the transmembrane proteins of the haemolysin family being a prominent example @xcite .",
    "one family member , @xmath7-haemolysin , is also often employed in single nanopore setups _ in vitro _ @xcite .",
    "more recently , solid state nanopores in artificial supports such as silicon compound membranes are manufactured by ion or electron beam techniques and open up the possibility for controlled technological applications @xcite .    in biology ,",
    "important examples for translocation processes are the passage of rna or proteins through pores in the nuclear membrane , of proteins across mitochondrial and chloroplast membranes or through the endoplasmatic reticulum , the cell - to - cell exchange of dna across the cell walls , or the viral injection of rna and dna molecules @xcite . in technology , biopolymer translocation",
    "is envisaged to be useful for rapid dna sequencing , gene therapy , and , ultimately , towards controlled drug delivery .",
    "the transport of biopolymers through a nanopore has attracted broad interest in the statistical physics community , as it represents a challenging problem in polymer physics @xcite .",
    "a quantity of particular interest is the average translocation time @xmath2 as a function of the chain length @xmath4 , usually assumed to follow a scaling law @xmath8 .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath7 hereby reflects the efficiency of the translocation process .",
    "thus , for completely directed ( ratcheted ) motion , one would expect @xmath9 , while for normally diffusive unbiased translocation @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "generally , the value of @xmath7 differs from these limiting behaviors , as effected by the entropic degrees of freedom of the chain - to - be - translocated .",
    "in particular , when the translocation dynamics is governed by unbiased anomalous diffusion @xcite of the form @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in terms of the translocation coordinate @xmath5 , the value of the scaling exponent @xmath13 becomes larger than 2 @xcite .    during the passage of a long flexible chain through a nanopore ,",
    "its two extremities can not access the volume opposite the membrane , and the monomer(s ) in the pore are more of less unable to move .",
    "this reduction of the accessible degrees of freedom of the polymer involves a considerable entropic barrier during the pore passage .",
    "while unbiased translocation has been argued to feature the same scaling exponent @xmath14 as the free diffusion of the polymer by its radius of gyration @xcite , where the flory exponent is @xmath15 in 3d and @xmath16 in 2d @xcite , the associated prefactor is much larger @xcite . thus efficient",
    "polymer translocation requires the presence of driving forces .",
    "most experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies focus on the driving force provided by an external applied electric field , which mainly falls off across the pore . in this case",
    ", @xmath7 depends on the translocation dynamics . for slow translocation , i.e. , under low driving force and/or high friction , @xmath17 in 3d @xcite , while @xmath18 in 3d @xcite for fast translocation due to the highly deformed chain conformation on the trans side , reflecting a pronounced non - equilibrium situation .",
    "in addition , for translocation achieved by pulling one end of the polymer with a constant force , @xmath19 was established @xcite .",
    "the above examples of translocation involve constant forces throughout the process .",
    "a different situation is encountered for translocating chains whose passage is effected by binding proteins , so - called chaperones or chaperonins @xcite . due to the fact that the chaperones bind more than one monomer of the chain - to - be - translocated , interesting variations occur in the effective driving force due to the `` parking lot effect '' .    here",
    "we consider a case motivated by state - of - the - art fluidic nanochannel setups , in which the driving force grows constantly with the progress of the translocation process , until a saturation is reached when the entire chain is in the channel . in such setups one or multiple nanochannels branch off a micron - sized feeder channel ( access hole ) @xcite .",
    "the driving force is provided by the liquid flow : while the flow field is quite low in the feeder channel , the flow velocity is much higher inside the narrow channel .",
    "once one end of the chain enters the nanochannel , it is veritably sucked inside , the overall drag force on the chain increasing as more and more of the monomers enter the channel .",
    "similarly , one might think of setups in which an electric field falls off in a long channel . if each monomer of the chain - to - be - translocated carries a net charge , the force acting on the chain will increase with the proportion of the chain inside the channel .",
    "this is not the case for the relatively short channel @xcite , where the driving force can not be proportional to the translocated monomers once the first monomer has passed through the pore . in many cases",
    "such fluidic setups are built in a pseudo two - dimensional geometry , i.e. , the channel is sandwiched between two parallel walls , that are close to each other .",
    "having such scenarios in mind we consider the geometry depicted in fig .",
    "we investigate this problem using analytical techniques and langevin dynamics ( ld ) simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe our model and the simulations technique . in section iii , we present and discuss our results .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section iv .    .",
    "the driving force acting on the bead in the channel can be provided by an applied intra - channel electric field or a uniform flow of the solvent in the channel .",
    "we assume that the net force on the chain is proportional to the number of monomers , @xmath20 , in the chain.,width=309 ]",
    "in our numerical simulations , the polymer chains are modeled as bead - spring chains of lennard - jones ( lj ) particles with the finite extension nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential @xcite .",
    "excluded volume interactions between beads are taken into consideration by a short range repulsive lj potential @xmath21+{\\varepsilon},\\ ] ] for @xmath22 and 0 for @xmath23 . here , @xmath24 is the diameter of a bead and @xmath25 is the potential depth .",
    "the connectivity between neighboring beads is modeled as a fene spring with @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance between consecutive beads , @xmath28 is the spring constant , and @xmath29 is the maximum allowed separation between connected beads .",
    "we consider the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : two strips with separation @xmath0 consisting of stationary particles with a bead - bead distance @xmath24 form the walls of the channel , as well as the `` membrane '' containing the pore . between all bead - wall particle pairs",
    ", there exists the same short range repulsive lj interaction as described above . in the ld simulations ,",
    "each bead is subjected to conservative , frictional , and random forces , respectively , with @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bead mass , @xmath32 is the friction coefficient for a single bead , @xmath33 is the bead velocity , and @xmath34 is the random force satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the external force is expressed as @xmath35 , where @xmath3 is the external force strength per bead , exerted on the translocating beads located inside the channel , and @xmath36 is a unit vector in the direction along the channel .",
    "therefore , the driving force for the whole chain is proportional to the number of translocated beads .",
    "experimentally , this external driving force acting on the beads in the channel can be provided by an applied intra - channel electric field or a uniform flow of the solvent in the channel .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the lj parameters @xmath25 and @xmath24 and the bead mass @xmath31 to fix the energy , length and mass scales respectively .",
    "the time scale is then given by @xmath37 .",
    "the dimensionless parameters in our simulations are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the langevin equation is integrated in time by a method described by ermak and buckholz @xcite in 2d .",
    "initially , the first bead of the chain is placed just inside the channel ( at @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , while the remaining beads are under thermal collisions described by the langevin thermostat to obtain an equilibrium configuration . the translocation time is defined as the time duration between the beginning of the translocation and the last monomer entering into the channel .",
    "note that , in contrast to many translocation setups , we allow the chain to escape from the channel back towards the cis side of the membrane . typically , we average our data over 1000 independent runs .",
    "here , we should mention that the effect of hydrodynamic interactions is neglected in our simulation .",
    "recent lattice boltzmann @xcite and molecular dynamics @xcite simulation results show that hydrodynamics is screened out in a narrow pore , which is the case here and in the experiments .",
    "in this section , we present our simulation results and discuss them in view of scaling arguments provided in the following subsection .      in standard translocation models , where the driving force acts solely in a short channel , only a single bead currently inside the channel experiences the driving force .",
    "for sufficiently slow translocation in the short nanopore , i.e. , under low driving force and/or high friction , the exponent @xmath7 in the scaling law @xmath8 for the translocation time @xmath2 can be estimated by the balance of driving force @xmath3 and frictional force .",
    "the velocity of the center of mass along the direction of the driving force is @xmath44 .",
    "the chain is not severely deformed during slow translocation processes , and the chain moves a distance of @xmath45 during the translocation .",
    "thus , the translocation time becomes @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "similarly , for polymer translocation under a constant pulling force acting on one _ chain end _ , the polymer travels a distance of @xmath47 during translocation , and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "however , if the external driving force is a function of time as for the present problem in a long channel with an intra - channel force , the translocation dynamics becomes different , as outlined in the following .    for a polymer of chain length @xmath4 in a good bulk solvent in two dimensions ( 2d ) ,",
    "the radius of gyration of the chain @xmath45 scales as @xmath49 , where @xmath16 is the flory exponent in 2d , and @xmath24 is the segment length . for",
    "a polymer confined between two strips embedded in 2d , the chain will extend along the channel to form blobs of size @xmath0 , as long as @xmath50 .",
    "each blob contains @xmath51 beads , and the number of blobs is @xmath52 .",
    "the free energy cost for the chain confinement in units of @xmath53 is @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the blob picture then predicts the longitudinal size of the chain to be @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal relaxation time @xmath56 is defined as the time needed by a polymer to move a distance of the order of its longitudinal size , @xmath57 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 scales as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the diffusion constant of the chain .    for a completely confined polymer in a 2d long channel under an external field ,",
    "the total driving force is @xmath60 with @xmath3 being the force acting on one bead .",
    "if the chain moves a distance of the order of @xmath61 under weak driving forces , the time cost can be estimated as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the velocity of the polymer . under strong driving forces",
    ", @xmath47 is still correct @xcite , but @xmath64 breaks down due to the deformation of the blob and the elongation of the chain under the driving force .",
    "thus , one can only obtain @xmath65 . for polymer translocation through a long channel with length @xmath66",
    ", we therefore obtain @xmath67 , which is _ independent _ of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this _ steady state _",
    "behavior in the channel , valid sufficiently far away from the two channel ends , is due to the fact that the force @xmath3 acts uniformly on each monomer .",
    "the behavior is different when we consider the translocation time @xmath2 measuring the time from threading the first monomer into the channel until the moment when the entire chain is inside the channel .    to assess the capture of a polymer into the long channel under the influence of the intra - channel field",
    ", the situation is somewhat complicated due to the fact that the driving forces are proportional to the number of translocated beads .",
    "however , we still can give a rough estimate , if the chain monomers sufficiently quickly reach a steady state in the channel .",
    "if @xmath20 monomers are located inside the channel , the chain on the @xmath68 side experiences the friction force @xmath69 and the entropic force @xmath70 , while the translocating part experiences the friction force @xmath71 , the entropic force @xmath72 and the driving force @xmath73 .",
    "according to the balance of driving force , frictional forces and entropic forces , we obtain the force relation @xmath74 based on the blob picture , @xmath75 with @xmath76 being a constant . for a chain with size @xmath77 in a channel with @xmath78 in units of @xmath24 ,",
    "the longitudinal size is @xmath79 , and then we obtain @xmath80 . once more than @xmath81 monomers enter into the channel , @xmath82 according to field - theoretical methods for 2d geometries ( strips ) and hard - wall boundaries @xcite . under the assumption that the chain on the @xmath68 side is close to its equilibrium state and",
    "is not severely deformed ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath70 can be estimated as @xmath84 $ ] @xcite , with @xmath85 being the elongation of the chain along the @xmath86 direction .",
    "in addition , @xmath87 , which under sufficiently slow translocation is negligible compared with @xmath71 , due to the much slower velocity .",
    "thus , at the beginning of the translocation , @xmath70 plays an important role .",

    "is dominated by the balance between the driving force @xmath73 and @xmath71 , particularly for larger @xmath3 where @xmath72 becomes negligible . then the translocation dynamics is dominated by @xmath88 such that @xmath89 if @xmath72 can not be neglected , once more than @xmath81 monomers enter into the channel , the translocation dynamics",

    "the translocation probability increases almost linearly with increasing translocation force @xmath3 , and is approximately independent of the chain length @xmath4 .",

    "<S> using analytical techniques and langevin dynamics simulations , we investigate the dynamics of polymer translocation into a narrow channel of width @xmath0 embedded in two dimensions , driven by a force proportional to the number of monomers in the channel . </S>",
    "<S> such a setup mimics typical experimental situations in nano / micro - fluidics . during the the translocation process </S>",
    "<S> if the monomers in the channel can sufficiently quickly assume steady state motion , we observe the scaling @xmath1 of the translocation time @xmath2 with the driving force @xmath3 per bead and the number @xmath4 of monomers per chain . with smaller channel width @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> steady state motion can not be achieved , effecting a non - universal dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath4 and @xmath3 . from the simulations we also deduce the waiting time distributions under various conditions for the single segment passage through the channel entrance . for different chain lengths but the same driving force , </S>",
    "<S> the curves of the waiting time as a function of the translocation coordinate @xmath5 feature a maximum located at identical @xmath6 , while with increasing the driving force or the channel width the value of @xmath6 decreases . </S>"
