    "after the discovery of a @xmath0 higgs boson , phenomenological high - energy physics has entered a new era .",
    "the new particle fits the expectation of the minimal standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this model is thus established as an effective field theory ( eft ) that correctly describes all current particle data ( except for still missing possible particle signals for dark matter and additional cp violation ) .",
    "we know about high - energy scales where the effective theory eventually breaks down  the scale of neutrino mass generation , the planck scale  but those are far outside the reach of collider physics .",
    "the hierarchy between those scales and the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , combined with the fact that all known elementary particles are weakly interacting , puzzles us due to the apparent fine - tuning in perturbative renormalization .",
    "however , the hierarchy puzzle as such has no phenomenological consequences . in principle , the sm may provide a complete description of all present and future collider data , limited just by our ability to do calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the apparent success of the sm does not imply that we have full control over the spectrum at presently accessible energies , say between 100 gev as the electroweak mass scale and a few tev .",
    "first of all , there is the possibility of extra light weakly interacting particles which escape detection at the lhc",
    ". we will not consider this in the present work but investigate new physics above the mass scale of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and higgs .",
    "the sm is complete as a renormalizable theory and weakly interacting .",
    "hence , it provides a mechanism for suppressing the impact of new physics on observables .",
    "this fact is generally expressed by the decoupling theorem  @xcite : all heavy particles ( heavy compared to the masses of @xmath3 , higgs ) can be integrated out , and their physical effects are suppressed by powers of @xmath4 or @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the effective energy of the measured elementary interaction , and @xmath7 is the mass scale associated with new physics . the eft approach , which has been widely adopted for precision lhc analyses , encodes this in a lagrangian which contains operators of dimension six and , in some cases , eight or even higher  @xcite .",
    "decoupling of scalar particles in the case of two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) has been considered in  @xcite , as well as in  @xcite .    for",
    "a new particle with a mass of @xmath8 , the leading corrections to sm particle properties are at the percent level and below .",
    "this is a challenge for lhc analyses . on the other hand , in scattering processes at the lhc",
    ", the partonic energy @xmath6 can easily enter the @xmath9 range , so direct detection is favored .",
    "various classes of new - physics models with extended fermion and gauge sectors can be excluded up to several @xmath9 . however , the current experimental sensitivity on details of the higgs / nambu - goldstone sector is still marginal .",
    "this is due to the fact that the effective energy available for vector - boson scattering in lhc collisions , for instance , is severely suppressed by steeply falling quark and @xmath10 structure functions .    in this paper",
    "we study new physics that is coupled to the higgs / nambu - goldstone sector and manifests itself in scattering processes of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and higgs particles .",
    "the higgs particle does not occur in the initial state and has its own experimental issues , so we restrict the discussion to nambu - goldstone bosons  @xcite , which the nambu - goldstone boson equivalence theorem  @xcite relates to longitudinally polarized @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons .",
    "that is , we investigate processes of the class @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , where the initial vector bosons are radiated almost on - shell and collinear off initial energetic quarks in the colliding protons .",
    "vector - boson scattering ( vbs ) as a physical process in hadronic collisions has been observed recently by the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite . the sm prediction has been confirmed , but the initial limits on extra interactions are still rather weak , probing an energy scale close to the pair - production threshold of @xmath13 . with higher energy and better precision becoming available at the lhc , and at future lepton and hadron colliders , data will become much more sensitive to new effects in this sector .",
    "there is no reason to restrict the modelling to weak interactions .",
    "in fact , the initially limited experimental resolution and energy reach encourages us to consider new strong interactions , as such deviations from the sm are experimentally most accessible .    for decades",
    ", the theory of vbs processes has been the subject of a vast literature , first in the disguise of the low - energy theorem  @xcite , for questions of unitarity  @xcite and as a means of phenomenological studies  @xcite .",
    "a review of recent work can be found in  @xcite .",
    "most of those studies were tailored to the higgs - less case , which is by now excluded . in the presence of a light higgs , in the sm , all vbs processes are perturbative and respect unitarity at all energies",
    ". this situation changes drastically once non - sm interactions are present .",
    "regarding the possible scenarios of new physics affecting vbs , there are no significant restrictions from low - energy data or from the absence of lhc discoveries .",
    "asymptotically , the process is determined by the amplitudes of nambu - goldstone boson scattering , where the initial state contains an even number of nambu - goldstone bosons and thus no half - integer representations of @xmath14 .",
    "any bosonic excitation coupling to this state also has integer @xmath14 quantum numbers and thus can not couple left - handed with right - handed sm fermions . in the limit of exact electroweak symmetry , vbs processes and ordinary sm ( fermionic ) processes",
    "thus probe distinct areas of new physics .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking mixes those sectors , but the mixing terms are again suppressed by the electroweak scale ( in operators , by additional factors of the higgs doublet ) , and are therefore subleading .",
    "the only important constraint is quantum - mechanical unitarity , which is severely violated in a perturbative calculation if we naively insert the dimension - eight operators of the eft .",
    "we have discussed this fact in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and proposed a framework of unitarization which allows us to augment the sm in an arbitrary way , while maintaining high - energy unitarity and simultaneously matching the new effects to the low - energy eft .",
    "we will adopt this framework , the _ t - matrix scheme _",
    ", for the concrete models below .      extending the work of  @xcite , in the present paper we consider a wider class of scenarios beyond the sm and beyond the electroweak mass scale . instead of just extrapolating the eft , which generically leads to asymptotic saturation of amplitudes",
    ", we add new states . the quantum numbers of the new states are chosen such that they retain unsuppressed interactions with the vbs system in the limit of vanishing gauge couplings . as mentioned above",
    ", this implies a certain set of quantum - number assignments and , incidentally , suppresses their couplings to the sm fermion sector .",
    "we may consider strongly coupled states , which we would classify as resonances in analogy with mesons in qcd , or weakly coupled states which we would call new elementary particles .",
    "there is a continuous transition between these extremes , such that we can cover all cases on equal footing .",
    "we defer the discussion of vector resonances to a future publication , since those states mix , after ewsb , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons and thus exhibit a possibly different phenomenology .",
    "this limits the model to four distinct cases , namely scalar and tensor resonances with two different assignments of electroweak quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "we embed these states in an extended eft and match this to the low - energy eft where the resonances are integrated out . for the high - energy limit ,",
    "we apply the t - matrix scheme which keeps the model within unitarity bounds when it eventually becomes strongly interacting at energies above the resonance .",
    "the case of a tensor resonance requires special considerations . while renormalizable weakly interacting theories can not include elementary tensor particles , it is nevertheless possible to set up an effective theory which contains a tensor particle and remains weakly interacting over a considerable range of energies",
    "this has been observed in the context of gravity in extra dimensions  @xcite , where massive tensor particles arise in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "massive gravitons provide a very specific pattern of couplings to the higgs doublet , gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "we will set up a more generic model where such relations are absent , and construct a lagrangian description of stckelberg type , where we can separate the genuine tensor resonance with a controlled high - energy behavior from unrelated higher - dimensional operators that become relevant asymptotically .",
    "the massive - graviton model emerges as a special case .",
    "( massive ) higher - spin fields have been discussed e.g. in  @xcite .    given the observation that new resonances can not necessarily be distinguished from asymptotic saturation",
    "if the resonance energy is high and event rates are low , we may ask the question whether the two cases are distinguishable , i.e. , whether a resonance model yields a different prediction from a eft extrapolation with specific coefficients . we will discuss this issue in an exemplary way for specific parameter sets .",
    "furthermore , the new model allows for weakly coupled resonances that do not leave a significant trace in the low - energy eft , but could nevertheless lead to a visible signal in collider data .    to obtain numerical results",
    ", we take the unitarized model , which is originally formulated in the gaugeless limit , re - insert gauge couplings and continue the amplitudes off - shell along the lines of  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to set up a model definition for a monte - carlo integrator and event generator , which we use to generate partonic event samples for the lhc , cross sections and physical distributions",
    ". a more detailed elaboration of the calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we are going to develop models for the high - energy behavior of scattering amplitudes of sm particles .",
    "this can not be done without precisely stating the assumptions that go into those models , and to cast them into convenient notation and parameterization .",
    "first of all , we assume that the sm is a reasonable low - energy effective theory . that is , a weakly interacting ( lagrangian ) gauge field theory with spontaneous @xmath15 symmetry breaking mediated by a complex higgs doublet , supplemented by the standard sets of quarks and leptons , describes all particle - physics data at and below the electroweak scale to a good approximation .    regarding the interactions of fermions and vector bosons ,",
    "this conclusion can be drawn from the impressive success in fitting electroweak and flavour data to the sm .",
    "we can not yet be so sure in the higgs sector proper . while the higgs boson was discovered in accordance with the mass range that the precision analysis of electroweak observables suggests , there is still room for sizable deviations from the sm predictions for its couplings . in particular ,",
    "the higgs self - couplings have not been measured at all .",
    "nevertheless , we will assume that those couplings are close to their sm values , such that deviations can be attributed to higher - dimensional terms in the eft .",
    "future data from lhc and beyond will tell whether this is true . if not , we may generalize our findings to a nonlinearly realized higgs sector .",
    "we have set up our parameterization such that this would cause few modifications in the calculations .",
    "a second assumption regards the low - energy spectrum : we assume that there are no additional light particles , such as higgs singlets or extra doublets , below the ew scale .",
    "if this was not true , it would not invalidate the extended - eft approach , but require the low - energy eft to be revised in order to include extra particles as building blocks .",
    "again , the model extensions discussed here would remain unchanged , but we could expect a richer phenomenology of final states that emerge from couplings to the extra light particles .",
    "we want to describe massive tensor and scalar resonances as extensions of the sm , coupled to the scattering channels accessible in vbs .",
    "we start from the low - energy eft , the sm with higher - dimensional operators included , and add a resonance with appropriate spin and gauge quantum numbers to the lagrangian . requiring the assumed symmetries to be manifest ,",
    "uniquely determines the form of the couplings , again in an eft sense , i.e.  as an power series expansion of operators in some inverse mass scale  @xmath16 .",
    "it is tempting to identify @xmath16 with the resonance mass  @xmath7 .",
    "this would imply arbitrary strong interactions at the mass scale of the resonance .",
    "the form of couplings would be arbitrary since for @xmath17 , there is no viable power expansion , and there are no reliable predictions . while this is a conceivable scenario ,",
    "we rather consider a more economical setup where the resonance at mass @xmath7 can be separated from other effects which are attributed to an even higher scale @xmath16 . as we will show below , it is possible and consistent to choose @xmath18 , both for scalar and tensor states .",
    "@xmath16 is then the appropriate scale for all higher - dimensional operators in the extended eft . in the low - energy eft , integrating out the resonance yields well - defined higher - dimensional couplings suppressed by powers of @xmath7 , which combine with the undetermined @xmath16-suppressed coefficients inherited from the extended eft .",
    "depending on their relative magnitude , we may  or may not  be able to relate the operator coefficients in the low - energy eft to the resonance couplings of the extended eft .",
    "a new massive spin - zero state might appear as another higgs boson .",
    "indeed , a new higgs singlet @xmath19 can couple to the sm higgs doublet @xmath20 via the renormalizable operators @xmath21}\\phi$ ] and @xmath21}\\phi^2 $ ] , while a new higgs doublet @xmath22 can couple via @xmath23}^2 $ ] and @xmath24}{\\operatorname{tr}\\left[{\\mathbf{h}}'{}^\\dagger{\\mathbf{h}}'\\right]}$ ] .. ] these terms contribute to higgs mixing and self - interactions , but not directly to vbs . in the eft formalism , the observed higgs boson is the only light scalar by definition , and in the renormalizable part of the lagrangian it saturates the vector - boson couplings .",
    "coupling an extra scalar to vbs then requires two higgs - field derivatives @xmath25 and thus introduces an effective dimension - five operator .    in a renormalizable extension of the sm higgs sector , after diagonalization new higgses may eventually appear in vbs processes .",
    "however , we have just noted that in the eft formalism , their couplings are higher - dimensional and thus power - suppressed . this is an incarnation of the higgs decoupling theorem  .",
    "renormalizability corresponds to the existence of special trajectories in parameter space , where all irrelevant ( i.e.  higher - dimensional ) operators can be removed simultaneously from the lagrangian by a nonlinear field redefinition . without a good reason",
    "_ a priori _ for allowing only points on these trajectories , we consider the renormalizable ( possibly weakly interacting ) case as a special case that is included in the general framework .",
    "this applies , in particular , to higgs sector extensions by singlets and doublets , as long as the extra scalars can be considered heavy in the sense of the eft formalism .    for our purposes ,",
    "the phenomenology of generic scalar resonances is then very similar to tensor resonances ( see below ) , namely breaking the renormalizability of the sm and inducing higher - dimensional operators both in the low - energy eft where they are integrated out , and in the high - energy model where they appear explicitly in the phenomenological lagrangian .",
    "we will have to apply a unitarization framework in the energy range at and beyond the resonance .",
    "we now turn to massive spin - two particles , postponing spin - one for later investigations , as stated above .",
    "the physical particle corresponds to an irreducible representation of the rotation group in its own rest frame and thus consists of five component fields , mixing under rotation .",
    "strictly speaking , there is no reason to develop a relativistic field theory for a generic interacting spin - two particle .",
    "if there is no uv completion of the interacting model , it is not possible to construct a complete hilbert space and unitary scattering matrix .",
    "however , for convenience of calculation , it is clearly advantageous to embed the tensor particle in the usual relativistic field - theory context of the eft for the sm .",
    "we therefore introduce extra fields , coupled to currents built from sm fields in a lorentz- and gauge - invariant way , in a lagrangian formalism .    for the scalar case ,",
    "this is straightforward since a spin - zero particle is represented by a lorentz scalar field that also has a single component . in the tensor case",
    ", we have to deal with the fact that the appropriate lorentz representation has more than five components . in the rest frame ,",
    "the lorentz symmetry ( or its universal cover @xmath26 ) is kinematically broken down to its @xmath27 subgroup , the universal cover of the rotation symmetry .",
    "the lorentz decuplet decomposes into the irreducible spin states @xmath28 looking at the symmetric rest - frame polarization tensor @xmath29 , the irreducible parts correspond to the components @xmath30 ( traceless ) , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( trace ) , respectively . under the full lorentz group",
    ", @xmath29 is also reducible and decomposes into the traceless and trace parts .",
    "however , in the presence of interactions it is not straightforward to maintain this decomposition for off - shell amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "our model setup requires that , on - shell , only the pure spin - two state propagates .",
    "if we represent the resonance by a single field , the tensor - field propagator must reduce to the form @xcite @xmath34 here , @xmath35 sums over a basis of five real - symmetric , mutually orthogonal polarization tensors that satisfy the constraints @xmath36 as long as @xmath37 is an on - shell momentum vector , @xmath38 .",
    "the solution to this problem is unique up to the non - resonant part @xcite , @xmath39 where the projection operator of spin - two can be written in terms of the spin - one projection operator , @xmath40     \\notag \\\\    & \\quad    \\qquad\\qquad - \\frac{1}{3 } p^{\\mu_1\\mu_2}(k , m)p^{\\nu_1\\nu_2}(k , m),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 this propagator , with vanishing non - resonant part , can be obtained from the free fierz - pauli lagrangian  @xcite coupled to a tensor source @xmath42 @xmath43 in the classical theory , the lagrangian   enforces the conditions @xmath44 this is , in principle , a valid lagrangian description of a tensor resonance .",
    "however , since we have to deal with off - shell amplitudes for an effective theory , it will be useful to investigate the role of various terms in more detail .",
    "returning to the propagator  ( [ eq : propagatortensor ] ) , there are momentum factors @xmath45 in different combinations that project out the proper spin - two part on the pole .",
    "going to lower energies , these factors vanish more rapidly than the @xmath46 terms and therefore reduce to operators of higher dimension . beyond the resonance",
    ", they will rise more rapidly and therefore potentially provide the dominant part that enters the unitarization prescription .      as discussed above ,",
    "the extra momentum factors in the spin - two propagator represent the mismatch between the @xmath47 little group representation of massive on - shell particles and the full lorentz - group off - shell representations in a relativistic description .",
    "this is in analogy with a massive spin - one boson , which in the relativistic case acquires an extra zero component . in the following ,",
    "we identify the extra degrees of freedom for a propagating spin - two object and separate them for the purpose of power - counting in an actual calculation .",
    "to this end , inspired by the spin - one case , we will use the so - called stckelberg formulation for tensor resonances .",
    "this has been studied in the context of effective field theories for massive gravity  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the work along these lines has been nicely reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "given an arbitrary symmetric polarization tensor @xmath29 that is not restricted by auxiliary conditions , we can subtract terms constructed from momenta , vector and scalar polarizations @xmath48 and demand that ( i ) the fierz - pauli polarization tensor @xmath49 satisfies the on - shell constraints  ( [ eq : epsilon - constraints ] ) , and ( ii ) the vector polarization is transversal @xmath50 .",
    "the resulting vector and scalar polarizations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 can be expressed as contractions of the original @xmath29 ,    [ eq : vst - polarizations ] @xmath54    formally , this subtraction removes the extra representations in the decomposition  ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) .",
    "we note that this prescription naturally extends to off - shell wave functions .    for the purpose of calculation",
    ", we can reproduce the effect of the propagator ( [ eq : propagatortensor ] ) if we remove all @xmath45 factors from the tensor - field propagator but add a vector and two scalar fields with their respective propagators . to enforce the on - shell relations  ( [ eq : vst - polarizations ] ) for their polarization ( i.e. , wave function ) factors , their interactions must be prescribed by the original tensor interactions . in field theory , such relations can be enforced by demanding a gauge invariance . since the momenta have been banished from the numerators of the propagators this way , the power - counting in the resulting feynman rules will be explicit , in analogy with the t hooft - feynman gauge of a gauge theory .",
    "stckelberg  @xcite originally formulated the algorithm that systematically introduces the compensating fields together with the extra gauge invariance in the lagrangian formalism . applying the algorithm to the massive tensor case , we start with the fierz - pauli lagrangian which corresponds to the minimal single - field propagator of the pure spin - two tensor . after removing any explicit constraints from the tensor field ,",
    "we introduce first the stckelberg vector @xmath55 that cancels the @xmath56 components , by the replacement @xmath57 and then cancel the extra unwanted @xmath58 components that this field introduces , together with @xmath59 , by a stckelberg scalar  @xmath60 , @xmath61 finally , we introduce another stckelberg scalar @xmath19 for cancelling the trace by @xmath62 this scheme guarantees that the interactions of the new fields in the lagrangian are correctly related to the original interactions of the tensor field .",
    "the resulting lagrangian exhibits the gauge invariances that reflect the redundancy of the stckelberg fields and there is a gauge ( called unitary gauge ) in which all stckelberg fields vanish and the original fierz - pauli lagrangian is recovered .",
    "the new fierz - pauli lagrangian with the additional scalar and vector modes reads @xmath63 the scheme simplifies slightly since both scalars are related to the original tensor , so their interactions are not independent .",
    "we can choose the gauge @xmath64 and arrive at a minimal stckelberg lagrangian  @xcite ( adjusted by partial integration and simplified ) , @xmath65 for perturbative calculations we have to fix the gauge up to residual gauge transformations @xmath66 that decouple on - shell , i.e.  satisfy the harmonic condition @xmath67 .",
    "to this end , we choose linear gauge conditions ,    @xmath68    and end with a diagonalized lagrangian , @xmath69 next , we normalize the fields canonically @xmath70 and find the canonical propagators @xmath71 for the resulting unconstrained tensor , vector , and scalar fields , respectively .",
    "as desired , these propagators do not contain any momentum factors .",
    "this fact turns out to be essential for a monte - carlo calculation for physical processes , where all bosons are off - shell in a generic momentum configuration .",
    "given this lengthy derivation , we may ask again whether the stckelberg formulation has any advantage over the original fierz - pauli lagrangian .",
    "algebraically , both are equivalent and result in identical on - shell amplitudes .",
    "this should be viewed in analogy with massive vector bosons , for which the stckelberg approach reproduces the usual reformulation as a spontaneously broken gauge theory .",
    "again , this is mathematically equivalent to the original model , as has been pointed out repeatedly  @xcite .",
    "however , once the accessible energy in a process exceeds the resonance mass , there is a conceptual difference . in the gauge - theory version ,",
    "there is no higher - dimensional operator with a @xmath72 coefficient .",
    "any additional effects would come with a new cutoff @xmath73 .",
    "scattering amplitudes are bounded beyond the resonance as long as @xmath16 is considered large . by contrast , in the formulation with massive vector bosons , there are @xmath74 terms in the propagator which _ a priori _ require the inclusion of a whole series of operators with @xmath72 factors .",
    "the model is strongly interacting from the onset and has no predictivity .",
    "if actual data show that interactions are indeed weak , this fact would be interpreted as a fine - tuned cancellation among terms .    turning this argument around , _ if _ a vector boson is observed to interact weakly over a significant range of scales above its mass , it is natural to describe it as a gauge boson , which in turn determines the allowed interaction pattern .",
    "analogously , _",
    "if _ we assume that a tensor resonance interacts weakly over a significant range of scales above its mass , it is natural to describe it by the stckelberg approach .",
    "we will therefore adopt the stckelberg lagrangian as the basis of a tensor - eft with a minimum set of free parameters .    clearly , we can always add extra interactions with further free parameters .",
    "those interactions take the form of higher - dimensional operators which do not contribute on the resonance .",
    "they describe unrelated new - physics effects .",
    "we now combine the findings of the previous section in order to set up a lagrangian description of the resonances , as an extension of the low - energy eft which already ( implicitly ) includes the complete set of higher - dimensional operators . apart from the lorentz representations as scalar or tensor",
    ", we have to consider the representation of the internal symmetry group .",
    "as we will argue in detail below , we take this as the higgs - sector global symmetry @xmath75 , where only the @xmath76 subgroup is gauged .",
    "@xmath77 breaking terms can be systematically included , but we do not consider those in the present work .      in the literature on vbs , resonances have traditionally been categorized in terms of weak isospin , i.e. , custodial @xmath78 multiplets .",
    "this is appropriate for a higgsless scenario , where the actual scale of ewsb is given by its natural value @xmath79 ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) . without a light higgs boson ,",
    "vbs scattering at the lhc would probe the physics at energies below the true ewsb scale , so the ( approximate ) low - energy symmetry applies .",
    "however , since the discovery of the higgs boson , we know that vbs processes probe a scale above the masses of the physical higgs and the electroweak gauge bosons . we have to impose the unbroken high - energy symmetry on the theoretical description . neglecting hypercharge ,",
    "this is @xmath75 .",
    "we therefore describe new resonances coupled to the sm higgs sector in terms of @xmath75 multiplets .",
    "it is not obvious that new physics coupled to the higgs sector actually has this symmetry .",
    "@xmath75 is , first of all , an accidental approximate symmetry of the sm ewsb sector .",
    "there are no possible terms in the dimension - four higgs potential that break @xmath77 , so ewsb leaves the diagonal custodial @xmath27 symmetry untouched",
    ". however , hypercharge and top - quark couplings are not consistent with @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless , in the gaugeless limit the hypercharge coupling vanishes , and top quarks are irrelevant for vbs anyway , so @xmath77 remains a good symmetry of vbs ( at high @xmath80 ) in the sm . beyond the sm ,",
    "new effects in vbs are transmitted only via the higgs doublet . in the low - energy eft",
    ", they require higher - dimensional operators . these would cause power corrections to the @xmath81 parameter and are therefore constrained by the observed agreement of the measured @xmath81 parameter with the pure sm prediction . for our purposes , we thus adopt @xmath77 as a symmetry of new physics in the higgs sector , to keep things simple .",
    "we have to keep in mind that this need not be the case , and leave the discussion of @xmath77 breaking in this context to future work .",
    "resonances of even spin with unsuppressed couplings to a pair of higgs / nambu - goldstone bosons , must reside in the symmetric part of the decomposition of the product representation of the @xmath82 symmetry , @xmath83 . in the effective interaction operator",
    ", this representation appears as a @xmath84 factor .",
    "there are only two possibilities :    1 .",
    "@xmath85 : a neutral singlet ( isoscalar ) .",
    "@xmath86 : a @xmath87 matrix , which contains nine components .",
    "after ewsb , the multiplet decomposes into an isotensor ( five components ) , an isovector ( three components ) , and an isoscalar ( one component ) . in terms of the gauged @xmath88 subgroup",
    ", the nonet decomposes into a complex @xmath14 triplet with a doubly charged component and a real @xmath14 triplet , as described in  @xcite .",
    "the relative mass splitting between these states is of order @xmath89 , where @xmath7 is the average resonance mass . for our purposes where we assume @xmath90",
    ", we ignore that splitting and thus deal with a nonet of degenerate resonance components .",
    "we note that due to the existence of the light higgs , the close analogy between spin and isospin is broken at this point : tensor states have just five physical degrees of freedom , but an isotensor resonance in vbs , given the symmetry assumptions of the present paper , does not exist in isolation .",
    "the distinction comes into play once physical higgs bosons are involved in a process . in vbs amplitudes",
    ", the symmetry relates , for any given resonance multiplet , nambu - goldstone pairs with higgs pairs , i.e. , @xmath91 to @xmath92 production .    for simplicity of notation , we will continue to denote the @xmath85 case as isoscalar and the @xmath86 as isotensor , respectively , keeping in mind that the latter case actually is always accompanied by isovector and isoscalar components .",
    "for a scalar isoscalar resonance @xmath60 , we may consider couplings of the form    @xmath93}\\ ] ]    or @xmath94}.\\ ] ]    the former operator is of lower dimension and might therefore be considered the dominant contribution .",
    "it is part of the higgs potential and influences higgs mixing and production processes . in the present work",
    ", we assume that the scalar state has been broken down in terms of the sm higgs doublet and further states , which themselves arrange as multiplets .",
    "since the sm higgs couplings in the lowest - order eft , the pure sm , saturate the higgs couplings to sm particles and are fixed by definition , residual mixing and potential terms arrange into higher - dimensional operators .",
    "in particular , a resonance coupled to nambu - goldstone bosons is represented by the term  ( [ sdhdh ] ) , while the lower - dimensional term ( [ shh ] ) does not enter .",
    "we therefore do not consider  ( [ shh ] ) and concentrate on the dimension - five coupling  ( [ sdhdh ] ) .",

    "the higgs sector of the sm , after the discovery of a light higgs , is a new field of study for the experiments at the lhc , and beyond .",
    "while the sm yields precise predictions in accordance with the notion of a weakly coupled theory , a thorough analysis of electroweak data should be guided by reference simplified models which differ from the sm . extending the eft by higher - dimensional operators is useful for analyzing observables with bounded energy , but open scattering data",

    ", we have augmented the eft by resonances with even spin , namely scalar or tensor .",
    "assuming exact @xmath76 gauge invariance and , for simplicity , approximate custodial symmetry both in the eft and beyond , we can distinguish four distinct resonance multiplets with a single free mass and coupling parameter each .",
    "this class of models includes the decoupling limit of multi - higgs models and certain aspects of massive - graviton models .",
    "the models are set up such that we need only take the interaction with the higgs sector into account , while couplings to the gauge and fermion sectors occur only via mixing .",
    "this is consistent with the symmetry assumptions and with our knowledge about electroweak precision data , although it is clearly not guaranteed .",
    "the models allow for arbitrary higher - dimensional operators in the eft , unrelated to resonance exchange , so we do not lose generality .",
    "all amplitude calculations are meaningless unless we enforce quantum - mechanical unitarity , since naive extrapolations yield event rates in the high - energy region that can exceed the unitarity bounds by orders of magnitude .",
    "we have consistently implemented the t - matrix unitarization scheme which works on the complex scattering matrix of the model directly , simplified for the asymptotic range where longitudinal and transveral degrees of freedom decouple .",

    "scalar and tensor resonances can be handled in close analogy .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to extend an effective theory with an isolated tensor resonance up to a cutoff of order @xmath234 , where @xmath7 is the resonance mass , and @xmath235 is the physical higgs mass .    we have implemented the models in the monte - carlo package whizard and computed exemplary distributions and simulated event samples for the lhc .",
    "the numerical results illustrate that resonances in vbs may be detected at the lhc within a certain range of mass and coupling values . for a final verdict",
    ", it will be necessary to perform a complete experimental study and analysis , based on exclusive event samples in combination with background and detector description .",
    "we also find that the comparison with pure - eft results can be misleading if resonance and background can not be clearly separated , as it is typical for the situation at the lhc .",
    "we conclude that data should be analyzed on base of resonance models as well as pure - eft simulations .",
    "this holds , in particular , if limits or values are to be combined between distinct final states or with data obtained at a future lepton collider like the ilc  @xcite .",
