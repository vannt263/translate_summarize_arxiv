    "it can be argued @xcite that the space gradients are responsible for non - leading effects as compared to the dominant effects parameterized by only time dependent fields that we study here ( including anisotropy ) .",
    "our cosmological analysis of this theory involves geometries with or without spacial curvature , as well as anisotropy , and includes radiation and other relativistic matter approximated as relativistic dust described by an energy - momentum tensor consistent with conformal symmetry .",

    "we will use conformal time @xmath7 which is related to cosmic time @xmath8 by @xmath9 as in eq.([metric ] ) .",
    "the 3-dimensional part @xmath10 of the geometries we study include    * the isotropic frw universe with or without curvature @xmath11 @xmath12 * the anisotropic kasner metric with zero curvature @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two dynamical degrees of freedom in the metric along with @xmath16 and    * the anisotropic bianchi ix metric with curvature @xmath11@xmath17 where @xmath18 which are given in @xcite , depend on space coordinates ( and @xmath11 ) but not on @xmath19 the bianchi ix metric reduces to the frw metric with curvature @xmath11 in the isotropic limit @xmath20 and it reduces to the anisotropic kasner metric when the curvature vanishes @xmath21    the relevant degrees of freedom are @xmath22 here we have attached the label @xmath23 on the scale factor @xmath24 to emphasize that it is defined in the einstein frame .",

    "it comes from approximating these degrees of freedom as `` dust '' modeled as a perfect fluid , with an energy - momentum tensor of the form @xmath28 that is taken to be traceless ( @xmath29 ) and behave as @xmath30 to be consistent with the conformal symmetry for massless particles ( including radiation and matter ) .",
    "the potential energy term for the anisotropy involving @xmath31 @xmath32 is obtained by computing @xmath33 for the bianchi ix metric @xcite .",
    "the additional degree of freedom @xmath34 plays the role of the metric on the worldline and ensures @xmath7-reparameterization invariance .",
    "this effective action can be derived directly from the 4-dimensional action by inserting the metric including the lapse function @xmath35 where the lapse function @xmath36 is the einbein on the worldline .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath37 imposes the zero energy constraint which is equivalent to the @xmath38 einstein equation .",
    "eventually we work in the gauge @xmath39 which corresponds to the conformal time in eq.([metric ] ) .",
    "similarly , it can be checked that this effective action reproduces all friedmann - type equations that are derived from the original action in eq.([action ] ) .",
    "for our model we chose the following potential energy @xmath40 after insuring stability by requiring @xmath41 the plot of this potential , which looks like a well or double well for various values and signs of @xmath42 shows that it has features that are similar to other potentials used in cosmological applications .",
    "the reason for choosing this specific potential is that we can use some special tricks to solve the friedmann equations exactly in the frw universe and find all of the solutions analytically @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we can similarly solve the equations analytically for a few other potentials , as presented in a future publication .",

    "together with the 4 parameters of the model @xmath61 these 6 parameters determine the properties of all the solutions in the absence of anisotropy .",

    "other schemes of introducing scalars with a weyl symmetry are not useful to understand the solutions and their extension of the einstein domain .",

    "can be obtained by choosing a gauge for the local scale symmetry . in particular ,",
    "in the einstein gauge we denote the fields by @xmath94 with a subscript @xmath58 and we choose @xmath95 for all spacetime @xmath96 thus generating the gravitational constant .",
    "then writing @xmath97 we find that the conformally gauge invariant action ( [ c - action ] ) yields the familiar action in eq.([action ] ) with an einstein - hilbert term @xmath98 and a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath4 , and any potential energy @xmath99    another convenient gauge choice is the @xmath100-gauge in which we denote the fields by @xmath101 with a subscript @xmath100 . in this gauge",

    "it is useful to point our that the following quantity is gauge invariant in all spacetime @xmath106 in the einstein gauge in the gravity sector given in eq.([e - gauge ] ) it is equal to @xmath107 , while in the einstein gauge in the antigravity sector ( interchanging @xmath108 and @xmath109 in eq.([e - gauge ] ) ) it is equal to @xmath110 furthermore , in the @xmath100-gauge it is equal to @xmath111 . equating these quantities to each other by gauge invariance immediately gives part of the bcst transformation in eq.([bcst1 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the bcst transformation in eqs.([bcst1],[bcst2 ] ) is actually the gauge transformation from the einstein gauge ( both gravity and antigravity regions ) to the @xmath100-gauge and vice - versa .",
    "now it is clear that the @xmath100-gauge of the action ( [ c - action ] ) is valid in the entire @xmath112 plane in all spacetime , for all values of the gauge invariant @xmath113 .",
    "but the usual einstein theory as given in eq.([action ] ) is possible only in the left and right quadrants of fig.1 where @xmath114 or equivalently when the gauge invariant @xmath115 is positive . to give an einstein frame description of the top and bottom quadrants of fig.1 , where @xmath116 and the gauge invariant @xmath117 is negative , we need an einstein gauge just like eq.([e - gauge ] ) by interchanging @xmath108 with @xmath118 the result of gauge fixing in the region @xmath116 is an einstein action just like ( [ action ] ) , but with the gravitational constant @xmath88 replaced by @xmath119 and the wrong sign kinetic term for the sigma field .",
    "evidently , in this system there is antigravity rather than gravity since the newton constant has the opposite sign .    comparing the gravity / antigravity regions further in their respective einstein frames , note that the potential energy @xmath120 does not change sign , but is replaced by a new one @xmath121 which is related to the old one in eq.([v ] ) by interchanging @xmath108 with @xmath118 any additional terms in a complete action do not change sign either , but any terms that initially contain @xmath122 would look different in the gravity / antigravity sectors by the interchange of @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath100-gauge interpolates smoothly between the gravity and antigravity regions and this is why , among other things , it is helpful with the geodesic completeness of the geometry .    after discussing the classical solutions of the cosmological equations",
    ", we will return to the antigravity region to discuss possible instabilities due to the sign changes in the full action ( [ c - action ] ) , and what they may mean .",
    "first , recall the geodesic incompleteness of the geometry in the usual einstein frame , which is an old problem that has been set aside .",
    "this is typical for any frw cosmological solution with a big bang singularity , because the geometry is incomplete at the singularity as @xmath123 .",
    "a massive particle in the flat frw universe satisfies the geodesic equation @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the conserved momentum of the particle . from this",
    "it is straightforward to compute that it takes a finite amount of conformal time , cosmic time , or proper time , to reach the big bang singularity from anywhere in the universe .",
    "therefore the particle trajectory is artificially stopped at the singularity in a finite amount of proper time .",
    "this is geodesic incompleteness .",
    "it begs the question : what was there just before the big bang ? what would we find if we could allow our watch to run beyond the singularity where it was artificially stopped ?",
    "a geodesically complete geometry would provide at least a partial answer to this question .",
    "of course , modifications of the geometry or even a completely different description may be expected from quantum gravity or string theory .",
    "unfortunately , the question remains even more obscure in these formalisms because of the lack of proper understanding of how they should be applied to the cosmological setting .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to at least , at first , try to answer such a question in the setting of classical gravity .",
    "having the complete set of solutions analytically allowed us to answer such questions , and understand how to complete the geometry in the classical physics setting , thus leading to some surprising behavior , as follows .",
    "the complete set of solutions of the cosmological equations have been analyzed in detail in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these solutions are obtained with _ no restrictions on either the parameters of the model or the initial conditions on the fields_. before the important role of anisotropy is taken into account near the singularity at @xmath126 , there are 6 unrestricted parameters in our solutions as indicated following eq.([seffg ] ) .",
    "all 6 parameters are available to try to fit cosmological data far away from the singularity .    in the absence of anisotropy",
    ", the _ generic solution _ for @xmath127 behaves in various detailed ways in various regions of the 6 parameter space .",
    "this is given in the appendix of @xcite where we identified 25 different regions of the 6 parameter space in which the analytic expression is different for each case separately .",
    "the trajectory of the generic solution in the absence of anisotropy can be plotted parameterically in the @xmath64 plane of fig.1 .",
    "this shows that the generic trajectory crosses the lightcone in fig.1 at any point ( as determined by the 6 parameters ) so that @xmath128 keeps changing sign as the universe moves back and forth from the gravity patch to the antigravity patch .",
    "of course , to do so , the scale factor @xmath129 vanishes at each crossing , so that the gravity / antigravity patches are connected to each other only through the cosmological singularity .",
    "the behavior of the generic solution near the singularity changes dramatically in the presence of anisotropy . as will be outlined below , an important effect of anisotropy is to focus the trajectory of the generic solution to pass through the origin of the @xmath64 plane , such that the generic trajectory can cross the lightcone in fig.1 only at the origin where @xmath65 vanish simultaneously .      by restricting the parameter space or initial conditions",
    ", we find that there is a subset of special solutions that are geodesically complete in the einstein frame purely in the gravity patch .",
    "these are the zero - size and finite - size bounces shown in figs.(2,3,4,5 ) . as seen in figs.(4,5 )",

    "all relativistic particles in the early universe ) respectively .",
    "they are all typically non - zero and not negligible in the vicinity of the singularity .",
    "note that _ even if anisotropy _",
    "@xmath176 _ is infinitesimal , the attraction to the origin _",
    "@xmath177 _ _  is inevitable__.    the parameter space for which the potentials can be neglected is estimated by inserting the solution back into the the equations and comparing the magnitude of the potential energy terms to the kinetic energy and radiation terms . from this",
    "we determined that the radiation term @xmath178 in eq.([adot ] ) beats the potential @xmath1 by more than two powers of @xmath7 as @xmath179 and similarly for @xmath180 so @xmath181 is negligible near the singularity .",
    "similarly @xmath182 is negligible compared to radiation as a function of time _ near _ the singularity ( even when @xmath1830 ) provided @xmath184 .",
    "this condition is also compatible with a weaker condition ( @xmath185 , see @xcite ) that avoids the mixmaster behavior discussed in @xcite and is consistent with the discussions in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the attractor mechanism is an almost model independent universal behavior since the potential energy @xmath1 is negligible close to the singularity .",
    "anisotropy in even tiny amounts forces the universe to behave as described above .",
    "the issue of _ initial conditions for all degrees of freedom in our model becomes partially resolved _ because at the singularity @xmath186 we must have the following automatically enforced initial values , independent of any other arbitrarily chosen initial conditions at some other time , @xmath187 rather than only @xmath188 .",
    "hence , we must take @xmath189 as the dynamically enforced boundary values at all cosmological singularities .",
    "this reduces the number of arbitrary initial values .",
    "now we see that the zero - size - bounce solutions described in the previous section ( figs.(2 - 5 ) ) are not really of measure zero .",
    "they do take into account effectively the dynamically enforced initial values of eq.([initial ] ) .",
    "although these solutions are not capable of describing the detailed ( antigravity loop ) behavior near the singularity , they do describe the correct analytic behavior away from the singularity where anisotropy becomes negligibly small .",
    "a more accurate geodesically complete solution is the combination of the near - singularity and far - from - singularity solutions which can be constructed by matching them at some time sufficiently away from the singularity .",
    "the physics during the antigravity period remains cloudy in our investigation so far .",
    "we discussed the trajectory of the universe on the average , including the antigravity period .",
    "however , once in this regime , we may expect some violent behavior and backreaction because of antigravity , and these may affect the trajectory during the antigravity period .",
    "first , because of the opposite sign of the gravitational constant we expect that chunks of similar matter will repel each other rather than attract .",
    "this is an invitation to investigate the nature of interactions , including fluctuations on top of our background solution , which so far we have not included in the analysis .",
    "furthermore , there are additional phenomena we should expect due to interactions as seen by investigating the form of the action in the antigravity regime , as follows .    because of the sign change of the effective newton constant one may argue that fluctuations of the metric , namely the spin-2 gravitons , will now come with the wrong sign kinetic terms .",
    "there are no gauge symmetries to remove them , hence , they will behave like negative energy fluctuations , which could destabilize the vacuum by the emission of negative energy gravitons together with lots of positive energy matter particles .",
    "there is however a counter effect .",
    "once particle production begins , it automatically implies a back reaction that changes the energy density @xmath190 for all relativistic matter that enters in the cosmological equations .",
    "this effectively amounts to a huge increase of the parameter @xmath27 once we enter the antigravity regime .",
    "so , rather than solving the cosmological equations with a constant @xmath27 in the antigravity region , we should allow @xmath27 to increase dramatically by large amounts . then according to our rough formula in eq.([duration ] ) for the duration of the antigravity regime ,",
    "the duration gets shortened as @xmath27 increases . in other words , particle production by antigravity",
    "shortens its duration .",
    "the particle production and the corresponding jump of @xmath27 need to be better understood .",
    "these are effects that oppose each other .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the balance of these effects with our current understanding of the corresponding physics .",
    "of course , quantum gravity effects need to be also included . therefore , it would be very interesting to study similar circumstances in the framework of string theory , although the requisite technical tools may not be available at this time . to formulate the antigravity aspects in string theory",
    "we could use the bcst field transformations given in eqs.([bcst1],[bcst2 ] ) , but even better would be the inclusion of the analog of the weyl symmetry in the framework of string theory .",
    "we should also mention that the phenomenon of the sign change of the newton constant transcends the specific simple model in eq.([c - action ] ) .",
    "the phenomena we have found should also be expected generically in supergravity theories coupled to matter whose formulation include a similar factor that multiplies @xmath191 in supergravity , that factor is related to what is called the kahler potential , and this factor , combined with the usual einstein - hilbert term , is not generally positive definite @xcite . in the past , typically it was assumed that the overall factor is positive and investigations of supergravity proceeded only in the positive regime .",
    "a discussion of the field space in the positive sector for general @xmath192=2 supergravity can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , our results suggest that generically the overall factor can and will change sign dynamically , and therefore antigravity sectors similar to our discussion in this paper should be expected in typical supergravity theories .",
    "furthermore , we can also draw an analogy to similar factors that occur in front of the kinetic terms for gauge bosons and scalar fields @xcite .",
    "these too can potentially change sign . in the case of gauge bosons , since the kinetic term takes the form @xmath193 where @xmath194 represent electric and magnetic fields , a sign change could be reinterpreted by an electric - magnetic duality transformation .",
    "indeed this type of duality was explored in depth at the quantum level for @xmath192=2 super yang - mills theory in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to point out that something similar may be part of the phenomena in the case of the gravity / antigravity transitions we have uncovered .",
    "having mentioned a few of the possible physical effects in the antigravity regime , we will proceed by assuming that the destabilizing effects of antigravity are not a disaster , but rather they are the signals of interesting physics that remains to be understood better .",
    "we expect that the general nature of our solution survives and still describes the interesting effects we discovered , namely the attractor mechanism and the presence of antigravity for some period of time between a crunch and the following bang .",
    "in this talk i emphasized the role of analytic solutions of cosmological equations to discuss geodesic completeness through the big bang singularity and the discovery of some new phenomena by focussing on questions that could not be answered with only approximate solutions . until better understood in the context of quantum gravity , or string theory , our results",
    "should be considered to be a first pass for the types of new questions they raise and the answers they provide .",
    "here is a brief summary of the main points we have learned .",
    "* we found new techniques to solve cosmological equations analytically .",
    "this led to all the solutions for several special potentials @xmath195 ( only one of those was discussed in this talk ) .",
    "several model independent general results that followed from this include geodesic completeness , and an attractor mechanism to the origin of the @xmath45 plane , which resolves partially questions on initial values .",
    "* antigravity is very hard to avoid .",
    "anisotropy + radiation + kinetic energy of @xmath196 require the antigravity epoch . for close to a year we tried to find models and mechanisms to avoid antigravity ( i.e. when _ all _ solutions of a geodesically complete model are included ) .",
    "the failure to find such mechanisms finally led us to take antigravity seriously .",
    "* we studied the wheeler - dewitt equation to take into account some quantum effects for the same system that we analyzed classically .",
    "we could solve some cases exactly , others semi - classically .",
    "this will be published at a later time . but let me mention that we arrived substantially to the same conclusions that we learned by studying the purely classical system .",
    "* will the new insights we obtained survive the effects of a full quantum theory ?",
    "my expectation is affirmative .",
    "perhaps the most satisfactory approach is to try to study the same issues in the context of string theory .",
    "however , this is actually quite challenging since string theory has not been developed sufficiently in the cosmological context .",
    "* i emphasize that the structure of the theory in eq.([c - action ] ) , the methods of solutions , and the phenomena that ensued , are historically direct predictions of 2t - physics in 4 + 2 dimensions @xcite@xcite .",
    "the model corresponds to the conformal shadow of 2t - physics which takes the form of a familiar 1t - field theory setting .",
    "other shadows @xcite of the same 2 t theory which would be in the form of dual 1t - field theories , could also play an important role to understand the system and its physical interpretation . *",
    "open questions include : are there observational effects today of a past antigravity period ?",
    "this is an important ongoing project for our group .",
    "this involves the study of small fluctuations and the fitting to current observations of the cmb .",
    "much remains to be understood , including quantum gravity and string theory effects , but it is clear that previously unsuspected phenomena , including an attractor mechanism and antigravity , are at work close to the cosmological singularity . the technical tools to study such issues in the context of a full quantum theory of gravity are yet to be developed .",
    "so this is an important challenge to the theory community , including string theorists , since here are some deep physics issues where string theory , if it is the correct approach at those scales , should play its most important role as a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "perhaps duality transformations of the type that occur in electric - magnetic duality @xcite could play a role as mentioned earlier . our understanding of cosmology and of the beginning of the universe could not be clarified until an understanding of the antigravity effects are obtained in a full quantum theory of gravity , and the associated phenomena are taken into account in comparing to cosmological observations .",
