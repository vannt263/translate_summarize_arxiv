    "simulations with light quarks face the problem of increasing noise in meson two - point functions with decreasing quark masses .",
    "some of this noise is due to using only a single source for the meson instead of averaging over all possible positions of this source .",
    "we present a method to improve such meson correlation functions .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite ; for related work see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the idea is to average the contribution of the low - lying eigenmodes of the dirac operator @xmath0 over all positions of the source on the lattice .",
    "the contribution of the high modes is calculated using the standard method , inverting the dirac operator on a single or a few quark sources .",
    "@xcite has introduced the name low mode averaging ( lma ) for this method .",
    "lma can have a considerable impact on the noise in the two - point function if it is dominated by the low - lying modes .",
    "we expect it to be particularly effective at low quark masses and for dirac operators with good chiral symmetry like the overlap operator @xcite which we use in our test .",
    "an example for the dominance of the low modes is the pseudo - scalar scalar difference shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the contribution of the low lying modes almost saturates the signal in the region @xmath1 , from which the masses are to be extracted .    for the simulation we have done",
    ", the improvement comes essentially for free since the eigenmodes are used to precondition the inversion of the dirac operator .",
    "the associated gain in speed of the inversion alone justifies their computation .",
    "we are considering zero momentum two - point functions of the form @xmath2 with @xmath3 the propagator matrix , @xmath4 and @xmath5 the dirac matrix corresponding to the meson in question .    in a standard simulation , however , one does not compute the full propagator but only a row , by inverting the dirac operator on a localized source at , e.g. , @xmath6 . on a given set of @xmath7 configurations one thereby obtains an estimator @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10    however , using eigenmodes of the dirac operator , one can compute @xmath11 itself . as this is in general",
    "not possible for all eigenmodes , we split the propagator in a contribution from the low modes and one from the high modes @xmath12 with @xmath13 the propagator in spectral representation @xmath14 the sum is over the @xmath15 lowest eigenmodes of the dirac operator @xmath16 with eigenvalues @xmath17 .",
    "the two - point function is thereby separated into four different parts , one from the low modes alone , one from the high modes and two interference terms @xmath18 the first contribution @xmath19 can be expressed by the low - lying eigenmodes alone and can thus be averaged over all positions of the source .",
    "the other contributions are restricted to the usual one or a few quark sources .",
    "to test the method we use 80 quenched gauge configurations of size @xmath20 generated with the wilson gauge action at @xmath21 .",
    "we use the overlap dirac operator constructed from hyp smeared gauge links .",
    "the low mode averaging is done using the 20 lowest eigenmodes of the dirac operator which are also used to precondition the computation of the propagator .",
    "the bare quark masses are between @xmath22 and @xmath23 which correspond to pseudo - scalar to vector meson mass ratios @xmath24 ranging between about 0.4 to 0.64 , see @xcite for further details . on each of the configurations the inversion of the dirac operator was done on two gaussian sources with radius @xmath25 , one located on time - slice @xmath26 , the other on @xmath27 .",
    "we average over these two positions .",
    "the @xmath28 matrices depend on the meson in question and we shall use the abbreviations given in table  [ tab : t1 ] .",
    ".[tab : t1]labels for dirac structure of currents . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we plot the effective mass for the pseudo - scalar scalar difference correlator .",
    "( subtracting the scalar two - point function removes the contributions of the zero modes . )",
    "using lma with 20 eigenmodes , we observe a significant improvement in the noise of the signal . in ref .",
    "@xcite we show similar plots for other correlators .",
    "to give an impression of the improvements in the various channels , the ratio of the uncertainty at time - slice @xmath29 with lma over 20 eigenmodes to the uncertainty without lma is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . in the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels",
    ", we find an improvement of roughly @xmath34 , which corresponds to a factor of 2 in statistics .",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 can not profit from the lma .",
    "it is known that low modes make a small contribution to these correlators @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of this method is to improve the errors of the extracted meson masses . in figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] we show the dependence of the error of the masses on the number of eigenmodes used in the lma . we find that the improvement seems to saturate at 12 to 16 modes included and reaches about @xmath34 for the pp - ss mass and about @xmath37 for the vector meson from the @xmath38 .",
    "we tested a method to improve meson two - point functions in lattice qcd .",
    "we found an improvement in the uncertainty of some masses corresponding to a factor of 2 in statistics .",
    "this improvement comes at virtually no additional cost because the cost of computing the low eigenmodes is justified by the acceleration of the inversion of the dirac operator alone .",
