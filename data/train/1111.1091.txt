    "the thermodynamics of most everyday - scale phenomena , e.g phase transitions , often reflects the underlying existence of a complex microscopic many - body dynamics which is approachable , generally speaking , in statistical terms only .",
    "understanding the collective behavior of physical systems comprising a myriad of interacting or not , classical or quantum particles does constitute an endless challenge , over the last years fed by the astonishing progresses in the production of new materials having properties tailored on demand @xcite , as well as in the manipulation of mesoscopic quantum systems @xcite .",
    "experimental and technological successes of this kind do indeed open new problems on a variety of many - body systems @xcite , to be dealt with by making recourse to the ideas and methods of statistical physics ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the correspondent task of the theoreticians attracted by these problems is to contrive simple enough but well addressed microscopic models as well as to develop , within the gibbs framework , new widely applicable mathematical / numerical tools leading to predictions of experimental interest . numerical approaches based on the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite have been successfully employed to produce a deeper insight into the behavior of quantum matter .",
    "such applications are even more important in the cases of non - integrable models when an exact ( even if usually complicated ) solution is not available .",
    "nevertheless these methods often require a huge computational effort , and might thus be heavily computer - based @xcite .",
    "recently a different approach based on a generalized version of the central limit theorem ( clt ) has been proposed by hartmann , mahler and hess @xcite and , at least for some specific class of problems , it turns out to be much simpler in its application than the rg - based treatment .",
    "such an alternative method relies on a gaussian approximation for the distribution of physical properties of quantum systems and in what follows we will refer to it as the gaussian approximation ( ga ) .",
    "in this paper we critically review such a method , clarifying its limits and highlighting its range of applicability , also providing applications to some exemplary physical system .",
    "in particular we show that this method has good agreement with the exact thermodynamic behavior only in the limit of high temperature , while it fails in reproducing the physics of a wide class of systems at low and intermediate temperatures .",
    "the existence of limitations for this method has already been noticed in @xcite , where the authors show that ga is unable to predict the true behavior of a particular system , namely an ising chain , at low temperature , and suggest that this should be a generic feature of ga .",
    "the novelty of our work is that , for the first time , it is rigorously shown the existence of systematic drawbacks in the applicability of ga . in particular",
    "our analysis confirms , elucidates and generalizes the limitations of this approach as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 is devoted to a brief review of ga .",
    "mathematical techniques allowing for closed expressions for thermodynamical quantities in the framework of ga are developed in section 3 .",
    "the method is applied in section 4 to obtain results on the thermodynamics of spin models , paradigmatic examples of many - body quantum systems .",
    "comments and conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "here we briefly review the gaussian method , originally presented in @xcite and based on a mathematical theorem proven in @xcite .",
    "the notations employed strictly follow @xcite . for more mathematical details on the fundamental theorem underlying the approximation and its proof we refer the interested reader to @xcite and to references therein .",
    "let us consider an @xmath1-block quantum linear chain with hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an operator composed of the block self - hamiltonian and the interaction between blocks @xmath4 and @xmath5 , thus reading @xmath6 @xmath7 being the identity operator in the single - block hilbert space .",
    "each block is described by a finite - dimensional hilbert space with dimensionality @xmath8 , the dimension of the total hilbert space thus being @xmath9 .",
    "it may consist e.g. of one or several neighboring spins . given a total hamiltonian @xmath10 ,",
    "one may define the partitioning into blocks in many different ways .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that ga applies as long as the dimension of hilbert space of each block stays finite .",
    "let us now define two basis of the total hilbert space of the system .",
    "the first one , whose vectors will be written as @xmath11 , is composed by eigenstates of @xmath10 such that @xmath12 .",
    "the second basis is made up of factorized vectors , written as @xmath13 , where each @xmath14 is a local state of block @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we define the two gaussian parameters @xmath15 to calculate free energy and other thermodynamic quantities in gaussian approximation , one needs to know only these two parameters and the ground state energy .",
    "let us for a moment leave apart the problem of calculating the ground state energy ( which may be solved sometimes exactly and otherwise numerically ) .",
    "it is often an easy task to calculate the above two gaussian parameters , as will be demonstrated on some examples below .",
    "for this reason gaussian method may seem apparently more attractive than other , much more sophisticated methods .    from the definitions given above , it is possible to build the operator @xmath16 with eigenvalues @xmath17 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite with the use of a central limit theorem , that under the condition that a constant @xmath18 exists such that @xmath19 the following limit strictly holds : @xmath20)=\\int_{z_{1}}^{z_{2}}\\frac{e^{-\\frac{z^{2}}{2}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath21)\\equiv\\sum_{\\ { |\\phi\\rangle : z_{1}\\leq z_{\\phi}\\leq z_{2 } \\}}|\\langle a|\\phi\\rangle|^{2}$ ] .",

    "does not imply eqs .",
    "the reason is that the convergence in is the convergence of a distribution , which is too weak to justify the summation of large ( infinite , in the limiting case ) number of terms @xcite .",
    "thus eqs . , must be considered as an approximation motivated by a central limit theorem , whose range of validity should be carefully established .",
    "this latter task is the goal of our work .",
    "in performing such an analysis , we often will work in the limit of very high number of blocks , when the number of terms in the sum in eqs .",

    "it is reasonable to exchange summation over @xmath33 by integration over energy , introducing a density @xmath34 defined as the number of states @xmath35 for which @xmath36 $ ] . with this definition one",
    "can then replace summation with integration as @xmath37",
    "in this section we are interested in studying the physical predictions of ga and comparing them with the true behavior of thermodynamic quantities . in what follows",
    "we try to be as general as possible , in order to analyze the how and why ga shows limits of applicability . in the next section",
    "we will show how these limits apply to some particular system .      to begin with , we highlight a technical issue which is crucial for discussing ga at large @xmath1 .",
    "let us focus on the behavior of complementary error function which enters eq .",

    "it is thus shown that ga and exact results coincide , up to the order @xmath58 , in the high temperature limit , since by exploiting the knowledge of partition function one can obtain expressions for every thermodynamical quantity of interest . +   +      what about low temperatures ? in order to avoid unwanted divergences when taking the limit @xmath59 , in the present subsection ( but nowhere else ! )",
    "we define the hamiltonian ( [ block hamiltonian ] ) in such a way that the ground state energy @xmath26 equals zero",

    "what about the entropy at zero temperature ?",
    "ga gives @xmath79 .",
    "however , according to the third law of thermodynamics , entropy is zero at @xmath76 @xcite .",

    "one can notice a very good agreement between both the approximate free energies and the exact one as long as temperature is high enough ( @xmath147 ) , as expected from the high temperature expansion , equation , but such a good agreement breaks down at intermediate and low temperatures .",
    "ga in y - basis , in particular , gives the worst approximation , while ga in z - basis is closer to the exact free energy , while still showing all the drawbacks highlighted in the previous section .",
    "note that ga in y - basis , as shown , actually coincides with gga for this particular model and thus is affected by a greater source of error , while ga in z - basis , as derived directly from ( and as such , not in the thermodynamic limit ) , is more accurate .",
    "the difference between the approximate and exact results is even more marked if we consider that all measurable quantities are obtained as derivatives of the free energy with respect to temperature .",
    "ga thus predicts , even in the thermodynamic limit , a behavior which is , at low temperature , very different from the one actually shown by ising chain .",

    "ga and gga coincide in this case . this fact , and further the fact that the application of ga yields exactly the same result as the one obtained for the ising chain in the previous section are not surprising : it has indeed been shown that the cluster ising model is equivalent to an ising chain in external magnetic field , and as such also ga can be applied equivalently . * cluster ising chain in magnetic field : + @xmath150 . in this case one can apply ga in @xmath115-basis and gga in @xmath132- or @xmath116- basis .",

    "particularly interesting , this model has an highly degenerate ground state , which might lead it to violate the third law of thermodynamics and thus to a non - zero value for @xmath152 .",
    "however one in generals expects the zero - point entropy to depend only on the degree of degeneracy of the ground state , while the value predicted by ga depends on the energy of the ground state , which is clear from eq . .",
    "even in this case we then expect the exact solution to be very different from ga in the limit of low temperature .",
    "one could be wondering whether ga might be more efficiently exploited to get an insight on the physics of statistical models when analyzed in their non - thermal parameter space .",
    "the possibility of detecting signatures of quantum critical points ( qcps ) in the behavior of thermodynamic functions is of great interest in the context of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) @xcite and in connection with quantum correlations between sites .",
    "it is well known that an ising chain described by indeed shows the presence of a qcp when @xmath153 , leading to a transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase .",
    "such a transition is a second order qpt , which means it leaves signatures on the critical behavior of the second derivative of free energy with respect to one of the two hamiltonian parameters when @xmath154 .",
    "such a criticality is due to a non - analytical point in the ground state energy ( which by definition is the limit of free energy as @xmath59 ) and is thus clearly present , as easily checked , also in the ga which strongly depends on @xmath155 .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in the previous section and as can be seen from , the knowledge of @xmath155 is a necessary condition for the application of ga to any system .",
    "this means that in order to calculate @xmath75 one should know in advance @xmath155 and thus its whole set of non - analytical points .",
    "ga is then unable to supply further information on qpts or to extract them more efficiently directly from the hamiltonian operator .",
    "differently from what argued in @xcite then , ga can actually be applied to the study of qpts ( indeed at @xmath76 the free energy , as given by ga , coincides with the true one even if , as noticed in @xcite , the two partition functions actually differ ) but requires the same computational effort as an exact analysis and is thus not useful in simplifying any calculation .",
    "+ the prime goal of our study has been the investigation on the range of validity of the ga .",
