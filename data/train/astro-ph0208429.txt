    "there is increasing evidence that the narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) associated with many classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have a complex dynamical and excitation evolution .",
    "evidence for a cocoon of strong , auto - ionising and radiative shocks ( see the theory by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) is particularly compelling for many luminous classes of radio galaxies . these include the steep - spectrum radio sources ( css ) , @xcite , unbeamed gigahertz - peaked sources ( gps ) ( see the recent review by @xcite ) , compact symmetric objects ( cso ) ( @xcite , and references therein ) or compact double sources ( cd ) @xcite .",
    "together , these represent an appreciable fraction ( 10 - 30% ) of luminous radio sources .",
    "not only are such sources very luminous at radio frequencies , but they also are very luminous in optical emission lines , and spectra by gelderman and whittle ( 1994,1996 ) reveal intense `` narrow line '' emission with line ratios similar to those of seyfert 2 galaxies . for these objects ,",
    "the line emission scales with radio power , and the continuity of properties across these different classes of sources argues strongly that the kinetic energy supplied by the radio - emitting jets may provide a substantial fraction of the power radiated at other wavelengths by shocked gas associated with the nlrs of these galaxies .",
    "the high redshift radio galaxies present us with a statistically significant sample in which to study uv line ratio behaviour and so investigate the fraction of the nlr emission produced by shocks , and the fraction by photoionization .",
    "the study by best et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) revealed an extraordinary result for powerful 3c radio galaxies with @xmath1 they find that both the uv line profiles and the uv  line ratio diagnostics imply that , when the scale of the radio lobes is such that they are still able to interact with the gas in the vicinity of the galaxy , they are predominantly shock - excited , but when the lobe has burst out into intergalactic space , the ionised gas left behind is predominantly photoionized .",
    "the ratio of fluxes in the different classes of source suggests that the energy flux in the uv radiation field is about 1/3 of the energy flux in the jets .",
    "thus , both shocks and photoionization are important in the overall evolution of radio galaxies . this result ,",
    "if confirmed for radio sources in general , would prove that that the properties of the radio jet are intimately connected with the properties of the central engine .",
    "very distant radio galaxies have been recently studied by de breuck ( 2000 ) .",
    "he finds that diagnostic diagrams involving c  iv , he  ii and c  iii ] fit to the pure photoionization models , but that the observed c  ii]/c  iii ] requires there to be a high - velocity shock present .",
    "he argues that composite models would be required to give a self - consistent description of all the line ratios , and that these may require a mix of different physical conditions as well .",
    "a fine example of such a source is provided by the @xmath2 radio galaxy 4c 41.17 has recently been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "this object consists of a powerful `` double - double '' radio source embedded in a @xmath3 kpc ly@xmath4 halo ( @xcite ) and shows strong evidence for jet - induced star formation at @xmath5 associated with the inner radio jet .",
    "@xcite constructed a model involving the interaction of a high - powered jet with an energy flux of @xmath6ergs  s@xmath0 interacting with a dense cloud .",
    "likewise , the outer jet has imposed a strong dynamical signature of outflow with velocities in excess of 500 km  s@xmath0 in the line - emitting gaseous halo .    on the basis of such observations",
    ", we can propose a simple evolutionary scenario for such radio sources .",
    "first , the accretion onto the central engine drives a radio jet which is first visible as a gps source , but later evolves into a powerful 3c - like double lobe radio source . during the time that the scale of the radio lobes is less than 10 - 30  kpc",
    ", the interactions with the surrounding galactic medium are strong , and the nlr is predominantly shock - excited .",
    "the radio jets bore out `` ionization cones '' which are responsible for the `` alignment effect '' seen in the nlr of such sources . at late phases ,",
    "the ionized gas is either photoionized by the central source , or by shock - induced star formation that must inevitably take place along the boundaries of the old shocked cocoon .",
    "dynamical signatures of strong shocks are apparent in only @xmath7 of seyfert ( eg .",
    "many of these are the more radio - luminous galaxies includinding mrk78 ( @xcite ) , ngc2992 ( @xcite ) or mrk 1066 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the power requirements are modest , typically 10@xmath8 and 10@xmath9 ergs  s@xmath0 _ c.f _ those of luminous radio sources ( 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11erg  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the remainder of seyfert galaxies appear to be photoionised ( @xcite ) .    in the gas - rich and cloudy circumnuclear environments , light and low - power radio jets",
    "are readily disrupted and suffer entrainment from the surrounding material , and molecular clouds are crushed in the high - pressure environment .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by 2-d hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite , and in preparation . here ,",
    "shock velocities are generally lower and although shocks may be still important in shaping the circum - nuclear medium , photoionisation is more important for its excitation .",
    "a curious feature of the spectra of the nlr of photoionised seyfert  2 galaxies is that nearly all are located in a region showing less than 0.8  dex variation in [ oiii ] @xmath12@xmath13h@xmath14 , [ nii ] @xmath15@xmath13h@xmath16 or [ oi ] @xmath17@xmath13 h@xmath16 ratios , according to extensive observations by @xcite . within individual galaxies , spatial variations in these line ratios",
    "are even tighter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations constrain the dimensionless ionization parameter , @xmath18 , in the range @xmath19 .",
    "this would require that the density of the photoionized clouds falls off roughly as the inverse square of their radial distance .    theoretical insight into this problem",
    "has recently been forthcoming ( @xcite ) .",
    "because clouds lying in the path of the jet and its surrounding high - pressure cocoon are crushed at relatively low velocity , then any dust mixed with the cloud gas is likely to survive .",
    "if the central source produces uv photons with high local ionisation parameter , the dusty ionised gas is compressed , raising the pressure close to the ionisation front to match the radiation pressure in the euv radiation field .",
    "the regulates the apparent ionisation parameter , and ensures that the density of photoionized clouds varies as @xmath20 .",
    "each photoablating cloud is surrounded by a coronal medium in which the local ionization parameter reflects the `` true '' ionisation parameter delivered by the central source , and each has a dusty photo - accelerated radial tail ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the terminal velocity of outflow should correlate with the strength of the coronal line emission , explainig the observations of @xcite and @xcite ."
