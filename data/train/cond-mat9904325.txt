    "the understanding of phase transitions on non - crystalline structures has been recently improved by exact results connecting general geometrical features of networks to the existence of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complex when dealing with the critical behaviour of model systems . for continuos symmetry models the singularity of the free energy , which determines the critical behavior , appears to be related to the infrared spectrum of the laplacian operator on the network @xcite , while this is not the case for discrete symmetries ( e.g. the ising model ) .",
    "there , all known results suggest that the link between critical behaviour and geometry should involve some other topological features @xcite .",
    "an interesting result concerns the sierpinski gasket , a typical and widely studied fractal , where the ising model is exactly solved . on this structure , although continuous symmetry models exhibit a power law behaviour for @xmath1 , the ising model has an exponential low temperature behaviour which coincides with that found on the linear chain @xcite . to analyze the critical regime from an _ ab initio _ point of view , an interesting picture",
    "is provided by the study of the singularities of thermodynamic potentials . in 1952",
    "lee and yang in two famous papers @xcite first proposed their fundamental approach to phase transitions , consisting in studying the zeros of the partition function of a statistical system , considered as a function of a complex parameter .",
    "the partition function on a finite volume is a polynomial in complex activity or fugacity , so that the complete knowledge of the zeros distribution is equivalent to the knowledge of the partition function itself and all thermodynamic quantities can be obtained from it . on a finite volume",
    "there are no real zeros , the coefficient being all real and positive .",
    "however in the thermodynamic limit the zeros can pinch the real axis ( the region of physical interest ) producing a singularity in the free energy ( or grand - canonical potential)@xcite .",
    "the pinching points are phase transitions points on the parameter axis and the zeros distribution in their neighbourhood can be connected with the critical properties of the system @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a complete knowledge of the zeros is very difficult to obtain except for a few exactly solvable cases .",
    "general theorems hold for the zeros distribution in the complex magnetic field plane in a class of ferromagnetic lattice systems , including the ising model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "very little is known rigorously about the behaviour of the zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane , the so called fisher zeros @xcite .",
    "in general , it is not clear if fisher zeros arrange on smooth curves even if this is the case in some exactly solvable models . for the ising model on regular two dimensional lattices",
    "@xcite , the fisher zeros arrange on curves that cross the positive real axis at the transition point . in the one dimensional case only two zeros ( with infinite multiplicity ) are found and these have a nonzero imaginary part , so that there is no singular point for the free energy .    for statistical models defined on non periodic discrete structures ,",
    "fisher zeros show some peculiar features , making the analysis of their density and location extremely subtle . in particular , on some hierarchical lattices ( i. e. q - potts model on diamond hierarchical lattices @xcite )",
    "the zeros have been show to form a fractal set ( julia sets ) . in this case , while the general approach for identifying the singularity points and the critical behaviour still holds , the widely used arguments concerning scaling of singularities and zeros density with the volume must be handled carefully , as will be shown in the following .    in this paper",
    "we will study the ising model on the sierpinski gasket , obtaining a recursive relation for the partition function , from which the zeros of the @xmath2-th stage gasket can be obtained from those of the @xmath3th .",
    "the distribution we obtain is fractal and pinches the real axis at @xmath0 , so that a singular point with a power law critical behaviour could be expected .",
    "however , since the zeros density is found out to vanish exponentially in the neighbourhood of @xmath0 , these zeros do nt produce any singularity of the free energy : although the zeros pinch the real axis the ` critical behaviour ' is the same as the one - dimensional case .",
    "the sierpinski gasket is a fractal graph which can be built recursively with the following procedure : the initial stage ( @xmath4 ) is a triangle ( 3 sites with 3 edges ) and the @xmath2th stage ( @xmath5 ) is obtained joining 3 @xmath6 at their external corners , to form a bigger triangle ( fig .",

    "one obtains all the zeros of the partition function for the @xmath2-th stage gasket as shown in table  [ zerij ] , where @xmath59 denotes the set of the preimages of @xmath60 ( and @xmath61 is a set of @xmath62 zeros ) .",
    "@xmath63    from this table one can see that the preimages of @xmath64 by the @xmath65th iterate of @xmath57 appear at the @xmath66th stage and are zeros of all the following stages , while the preimages of @xmath67 are ` temporary ' zeros .",
    "it is also possible to find the multiplicity of these zeros : in fact since every root generates the root @xmath64 at the next stage , this value appears @xmath68 times among the zeros of @xmath2-th stage , the roots @xmath69 appear as many times as @xmath64 in the previous stage ( their multiplicity is @xmath70 ) and in general the multiplicity of the roots belonging to @xmath71 is @xmath72 .    in this way",
    "one can , in principle , calculate all the zeros of the partition function at any stage . in practice",
    "this is possible only for small @xmath2 because of their exponential growth .",
    "an alternative approach @xcite is to start from a root @xmath73 ( for example ` @xmath64 ' whose preimages are ` permanent ' ) then choose at random one of its two preimages by the transformation @xmath57 ( denoted by @xmath74 ) , then choose one of the preimages of @xmath74 and so on ; the set of points obtained in this way is a representative of the set of all roots and has the advantage to contain zeros relative to large @xmath2 .    by plotting in the complex temperature plane the roots obtained with both methods",
    "it can be seen that very few of them fall in the neighborhood of the real axis and no information can be obtained about the critical behaviour ( see fig .",
    "[ rand ] where the zeros are plotted in the plane of the variable @xmath75 ) .    a good technique to obtain more zeros near the real axis consists in changing the choice probability of the two preimages @xcite ;",
    "the two solutions of @xmath76 are @xmath77 @xmath78 and one can see that the repeated application of @xmath79 gives a sequence of points approaching the real axis .",
    "the set of roots obtained by increasing the probability of choosing the second preimage is not a representative set af all roots ( it does nt show their density not even approximately ) but gives us a chance to observe their behaviour in the interesting area ( see fig .",
    "[ rand98 ] ) .    a plot of these roots in the plane of @xmath80 ( @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath81 ) with a _ log - log _ scale ( fig .",
    "[ loglog ] ) shows that the real and imaginary part are related by a power law : the curve can intersect the real axis in the thermodynamic limit only at the origin .",
    "analytically one can verify this power behaviour by studying the transformation of the variable @xmath82 @xmath83 assuming that @xmath84 , that is @xmath85 and inserting ( [ a ] ) in ( [ g ] ) one obtains @xmath86 and @xmath87 choosing @xmath88 , one sees that the curve @xmath89 is ` conserved ' by transformation @xmath90 except for higher order terms in @xmath91 .",
    "we have seen that the zeros pinch the real axis only at @xmath0 and we proceed by studying their density in the neighbourhood of this point to establish the critical behaviour ; it is important to see whether this density ( which is quite small , as we have seen ) goes to zero or remains finite .",
    "a numerical estimate can be obtained by simply counting the zeros ( with their multiplicity ) .",
    "this has been done in two ways :    * considering only the zeros in the neighbourhood of the real axis and grouping them with regard to their real part ( one - dimensional density ) ; * dividing the complex plane in equal rectangles and counting the zeros contained ( two - dimensional density ) .    in the first case one",
    "obtains plots like fig .",
    "[ dens1 ] which shows the density of the zeros of the partition function with @xmath92 for gaskets from @xmath93 to @xmath94 ; in the second case obtains the result shown in figures [ dens2 ] and [ dens3 ] ( which refers to @xmath95 ) . from fig .",
    "[ dens1 ] one can see that going from one stage to the next the density does not change appreciably except for the tail towards @xmath96 that grows longer but is strongly decreasing : the density at @xmath0 appears to vanish exponentially .    this behaviour can also be verified by an analytical estimate .",
    "first we notice that the zeros near @xmath0 are those obtained by the repeated application of @xmath79 . indeed for @xmath97",
    "we have @xmath98 while @xmath99 and , in terms of real and imaginary part , @xmath100    applying @xmath79 to @xmath101 for large @xmath102 one obtains @xmath103 . in this limit",
    "the density of zeros in the @xmath60 plane becomes the product of two factors , one depending only on @xmath102 and the other on @xmath104 : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is bounded .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath107 for @xmath108 can be obtained by noting that , for each set @xmath109 , the zeros with real part @xmath102 are those obtained by a sequence ending with the application of @xmath110 followed by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 is a constant independent of @xmath102 .",
    "so this fraction of zeros is @xmath114 to the power @xmath115 , that is proportional to @xmath116 with @xmath117 . since the total density @xmath118 is a weighted sum of the partial densities that have the same behaviour we have : @xmath119    to find the density in the @xmath41 plane we must now divide @xmath120 by the jacobian of the transformation : @xmath121 this jacobian turns out to be @xmath122 and finally @xmath123 where @xmath124 e @xmath125 are the real and imaginary part of @xmath41 .    for @xmath126 ( that is @xmath127 ) the density vanishes exponentially , as we could infer from numerical calculation , and this behaviour has the same effect as a gap near the real axis",
    ". therefore the low temperature regime is not affected by the zeros contained in this region and one observe a situation analogous to the one dimensional case .",
    "this can be seen , for example , by comparing the behaviour of thermodynamical quantities : figure [ comp ] shows that , even if the zeros distributions seem to be quite different , the behaviour of the specific heat for the sierpinski gasket and the linear chain is essentially the same .",
    "the anomalous behaviour of the density of zeros for the ising model on the sierpinski gasket is to be deeply related to the its self - similar geometry .",
    "this strongly suggests a careful approach to the analysis of scaling of zeros density on fractals .",
    "in particular a stimulating open problem is the relation of this scaling with the geometry of a generic self - similar structure and with known anomalous dimensions .",
    "an important step in this direction would be the study of fisher zeros on the more complex case of a sierpinski carpet , where an exact solution is still lacking but the ising model is expected to have a phase transition at finite temperature .",
