    "theoretical studies of transitions between ladders have also been presented @xcite .",
    "bloch oscillations have also been demonstrated for a light beam propagating in an array of waveguides , with a linear variation of the refractive index imposed by a temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "when the applied uniform force is oscillating in time , the motion of a particle in a periodic potential is usually unbounded .",

    "one summand in the expression for @xmath33 and @xmath34 is modified , as indicated above .",
    "when @xmath209 , only this modified summand is nonzero , and the evolution operator @xmath210 for one time period is characterized by the values @xmath211 the eigenvectors of @xmath52 are the bloch states @xmath212 , and the corresponding quasienergy values are @xmath213",
    "we have analyzed the wannier - stark system , which is characterized by the hamiltonian ( [ hdisc ] ) , in terms of the operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the present interest in this model arises from the dynamics of atoms in a periodic optical potential , with an additionally applied uniform external force .",
    "we adopted the tight - binding limit , which implied nearest - neighbor interaction only .",

    ". [ heis ] and [ specinit ] , the parameter @xmath50 determines the shift in the value of the quasimomentum , whereas @xmath33 and @xmath34 determine the evolution of the average position and the width of a wavepacket .",
    "a particle starting in a single wannier state has a uniform distribution over the quasimomentum , and can not change its average position , wheras the width of its wavepacket is simply measured by @xmath54 . on the other hand ,",
    "even when only two neighboring states are populated initially , the wavepacket can display an appreciable motion . in sec .",
    "[ gaussian ] it is demonstrated that an initially gaussian packet remains gaussian at all times .",
    "this remains true when the initial state has a non - zero expectation value of the quasimomentum , which is described as an initial phase difference between neighboring wannier states .",
    "these results , which are valid for a uniform force with an arbitrary time dependence , unify and extend earlier results obtained for a constant or an oscillating uniform force .",
    "a constant force induces bloch oscillations of a wavepacket , and we obtain a simple expression for the amplitude of the oscillation and for the time dependence of the width of a wavepacket . for an oscillating force , the operator method shows that the quasienergy bands can be evaluated directly in terms of the value of the parameter @xmath33 after one oscillation period .",
    "this produces an exactly solvable model for dynamical localization and fractional wannier - stark ladders . in general , by selecting a proper time - dependence of the force or of the coupling between wells , thereby realize the desired values of the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath50 , we can coherently control the width and the position of a wavepacket , as well as the phase difference between neighboring sites .",
