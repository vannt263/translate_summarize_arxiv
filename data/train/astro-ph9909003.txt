    "the original charge to our panel , which consisted of myself , marc davis , avishai dekel , and ed shaya , was to discuss `` reconstruction methods . '' to narrow the discussion , we decided in advance to concentrate on the problem of deriving @xmath1 from comparison of redshift survey and distance indicator data .",
    "this seemed appropriate given the panel membership : all of us have worked on this problem , and together we span the spectrum of results , from low values of @xmath1 suggestive of a low density ( @xmath2 ) universe to high values consistent with @xmath3    while it may appear that we have strayed from the theme of `` reconstructions , '' @xmath1-determination is , in fact , closely linked with how we reconstruct the underlying velocity and density fields from the observable data .",
    "i clarify this point in   2 below . in ",
    "3 , i review recent results for @xmath1 from peculiar velocities and consider possible explanations for their wide variance .",
    "i conclude in   5 with a brief look to the future of the subject .",
    "our theoretical formulation of cosmic dynamics involves the mass overdensity field @xmath4 and the peculiar velocity field @xmath5 linear gravitational instability theory tells us that these fields obey the simple relation @xmath6 where @xmath7    such continuous fields are abstract mathematical constructs ; reality is more complex . discrete entities ",
    "galaxies  sparsely populate the universe , and we measure their redshifts and estimate their distances . _ reconstruction methods _ are the numerical algorithms we employ to turn these real - world data into representations of the underlying fields @xmath8 and @xmath9    several obstacles stand between the measurements and successful reconstruction of the density and velocity fields .",
    "first , there is * biasing : * how is the galaxy overdensity @xmath10 related to the desired @xmath11 in the oft - used if oversimplistic linear biasing paradigm @xmath12 and the linear velocity - density relation becomes @xmath13 to the extent linear biasing and linear dynamics hold , only @xmath14 not @xmath15 is measureable by this method . incorporating `` realistic '' models of biasing  and it is by no means clear that such models exist yet  presents another challenge to reconstruction methods .",
    "reconstruction of @xmath16 is if anything an even more daunting task : we estimate only the radial component of this field , at discrete , irregularly distributed positions , with large errors that grow linearly with distance .",
    "we can not invoke the theoretical velocity - density relation , and thus measure @xmath14 until we have reconstructed the underlying fields .",
    "if our reconstructions of @xmath17 and/or @xmath18 are flawed , we ll get the wrong value of @xmath19 and given the difficulties such reconstructions face , errors in @xmath1 are , perhaps , inevitable at this early stage in our understanding .    figure  [ fig : recon ] summarizes the relationship between reconstruction methods and @xmath1-determination . the box at the bottom concerns the nature of the comparison by which @xmath1 is obtained .",
    "if one reconstructs @xmath20 from the peculiar velocity data and compares its divergence with @xmath10 from redshift survey data , one is doing a _ density - density _ ( d - d ) comparison .",
    "alternatively one can reconstruct @xmath18 from redshift survey data ( for an assumed value of @xmath1 ) , using the integral form of the linear - velocity density relation , and compare with observed radial peculiar velocity estimates .",
    "this is known as the _ velocity - velocity _ ( v - v )",
    "the distinctions between the two approaches are subtle but important , as discussed below .",
    "= 4.25 in    = 5.25 in",
    "it was not until the early 1990s that measuring @xmath1 by comparing peculiar velocity and redshift survey data became a realistic goal . the advent of full - sky redshift surveys  notably those based on the iras point source catalog  and large , homogeneous sets of tully - fisher ( tf ) and related data were the key developments .",
    "the earliest attempt was that of dekel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the so - called `` potiras '' comparison . in this procedure",
    "the velocity field is reconstructed using the potent algorithm , and its divergence compared with the galaxy density field from iras ( a d - d comparison ) .",
    "dekel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found @xmath21 to @xmath1 when the galaxy density field is obtained from iras .",
    "other redshift surveys yield different overdensities and thus different @xmath1s . ]",
    "a value widely taken as support for the then - popular einstein - de sitter paradigm .",
    "the potiras analysis has since been redone with much improved peculiar velocity data , with the result @xmath22 ( sigad et al .",
    "1998 ) , still consistent with a critical density universe unless iras galaxies are strongly anti - biased .    between the first and second potiras papers , a number of studies , based on the v - v comparison , arrived at markedly lower values of @xmath23 shaya , tully , & peebles ( 1995 ) estimated @xmath24 ( @xmath25 if iras galaxies are unbiased ) using the least action principle to predict peculiar velocities .",
    "willick et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and willick & strauss ( 1998 ) used the velmod method to find @xmath26 the above results were obtained from tf data ; an application of similar methods to more accurate ( but far more sparse ) supernova data yielded @xmath27 ( riess et al .",
    "( this list is not exhaustive , and apologies are due to authors not cited ; my aim is illustrative rather than comprehensive . )",
    "thus , it appears that a somewhat bimodal distribution of @xmath1 values has emerged .",
    "the d - d , potiras method produces @xmath28 close to unity ; the v - v comparisons , several based on the _ same _ redshift and velocity samples as potiras , yield @xmath29 neither the d - d nor the v - v comparison is inherently more valid ; both are firmly grounded in linear gravitational instability theory .",
    "what , then , could be the cause of the discrepancies ?",
    "neither the panelists nor the conference participants arrived at a satistfactory answer to this question .",
    "however , the following list of possible explanations proved to be fertile ground for discussion .",
    "the list is accompanied by my own ( biased ) commentary on the salience of each explanation .",
    "* * malmquist bias .",
    "* this famous statistical effect has long been invoked as a cause of discrepant conclusions in astronomy .",
    "in fact , it is now a non - issue .",
    "methods are now available for rendering malmquist and related biases inconsequential ; see strauss & willick ( 1995 ) for a detailed discussion . * * nonuniverality of the tf and other distance - indicator relations . *",
    "another non - issue .",
    "it is easy to make the general argument ",
    "nonuniversal distance indicators imply spurious peculiar velocities  but there is little or no evidence implicating such effects in the @xmath1 problem . * * calibration errors in peculiar velocity datasets .",
    "* such errors may indeed be present ; new results from the shellflow project ( see the paper by courteau in these proceedings ) suggest that the widely used mark iii catalog has across - the - sky calibration errors .",
    "however , these errors affect mainly bulk flow estimates , not the value of @xmath28 ( see willick & strauss 1998 for a clear demonstration of this ) . *",
    "* non - trivial biasing . *",
    "it is now widely believed that biasing is not only nonlinear , but stochastic and nonlocal ( see the panel review by strauss in these proceedings ) .",
    "if so , it is perhaps unsurprising that different approaches produce different results , as they may in fact be measuring different things .",
    "this argument may well contain a kernel of truth , but i am not convinced it is the whole story .",
    "i was impressed by the work of berlind , narayanan , and weinberg on this subject ( see their contributions to the proceedings ) , which shows that for all but the most contrived models of biasing , the value of @xmath1 one obtains is relatively insensitive to methodology . *",
    "* the density - density versus the velocity - velocity comparison .",
    "* this , i think , is the central issue .",
    "we may be asking too much of our distance indicator data when we use them to derive the full 3-d velocity field and its derivatives , as is required for the d - d comparison . in the v - v comparison , by contrast , the distance indicator data is used essentially in its raw form ; only the redshift survey data , which is intrinsically more accurate , is subject to complex , model - dependent manipulation . from this perspective",
    ", i would argue that the low values , @xmath30@xmath31 that have come out of the v - v analyses are more likely to be correct .",
    "if we learned anything from our panel discussion , it was the usual lesson : better data will help . fortunately , some already exist , and more are on the way .",
    "the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) data of tonry and collaborators ( see tonry s paper in these proceedings ) are now available for comparison with the iras redshift data ; preliminary results are reported by blakeslee in these proceedings .",
    "sbf distances are considerably more accurate than tf distances and promise a much higher - resolution look at the velocity field .",
    "adam riess reported new , and also very accurate , sn ia distances for nearby galaxies .",
    "the extant tf data are not likely to increase dramatically in the short term , but will be recalibrated by the shellflow program , and perhaps the different tf data sets ( mark iii , sfi , tully s catalog ) will be merged into a larger , homogeneous catalog . in the longer term ( @xmath3210 years )",
    ", they will be supplanted by much larger and more uniform tf data sets that will emerge from the wide - field infrared surveys currently under way , 2mass and denis ( see the contributions by huchra and mamon in these proceedings ) .",
    "i draw yet another lesson from our panel discussion : we have not yet fully developed the analytical methods needed to deal with nonlinearities in the universe , both dynamical and biasing - related . in this regard",
    "i would encourage theorists to address the problem of , how , given a particular biasing model , do we predict the peculiar velocity field from redshift survey data , taking full account of nonlinear dynamics ? when reliable methods are developed for doing this , and tested against n - body simulations , we will be able to fully exploit the improved peculiar velocity data sets of the future .",
