    "meanwhile , some observations have addressed possible site of the electron acceleration .",
    "@xcite studied timing relationship among hard x - ray emissions in different energies and quantitatively estimated locations of electron acceleration region as above the flaring loops .",
    "@xcite argued that electron acceleration should take place at the reconnection site which is a common place among the two different magnetic field configurations identified from foot point motions of hard x - ray sources during the impulsive phases .",
    "these observations gave us the supposition that the particle acceleration would occur above the flaring loops .",
    "however , there have not been any observations that pinpoint where and how in the flaring magnetic field plasmas are accelerated .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that magnetic reconnection in flares takes place in the high corona where plasma density is low , and hard x - ray fluxes from energetic non - thermal electrons , which are emitted by bremsstrahlung ( interaction with ambient coronal plasma ) , are too weak to be imaged by existing modulation - collimator type hard x - ray telescopes whose dynamic range is not high , especially for the reconnection region .",
    "meanwhile , there is a possibility that microwaves emitted from the energetic non - thermal electrons by gyro - syncrotoron mechanism ( interaction with coronal magnetic fields ) can be detected even in the low density corona including the reconnection region .    in this paper",
    ", we report the first identification of energetic non - thermal electrons around the reconnection x - point in a flare ; with the location of the x - point identified by soft x - ray imagery and the localized presence of non - thermal electrons identified from imaging - spectroscopic data at two microwave frequencies .",
    "this is a strong evidence of the electrons being accelerated around the x - point , providing an observational clue toward understanding the mechanism of electron acceleration in solar flares .",
    "we present soft x - ray and microwave imaging observations , made with the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) @xcite aboard the _ yohkoh _ satellite and the nobeyama radioheliograph @xcite , respectively , of the 6 august 1999  ut flare that occurred from around 04:34  ut in noaa active region 8647 on the west limb of the sun ( s19w91 ; see figure  [ fig : data ] ) .",
    "the x - ray flux detected by goes satellite was almost flat at a level of @xmath0 c6 .",
    "the evolution of this flare was not seen in the goes light curve , probably because this flare was not large enough in soft x - ray flux against the other eight active regions simultaneously located on the solar disk .",
    "hence , we track the evolution of this flare with the soft x - ray intensity from the flaring loop derived from the _ yohkoh_/sxt data as described in section  [ sec : observations in soft x - rays ] .",
    "though we also check the hard x - ray data taken with the hard x - ray telescope ( hxt ) aboard the _ yohkoh _ satellite , the hard x - ray signal from this flare was very weak against the background level .",
    "this is probably because the foot point of the flaring loop was located behind the solar limb .",
    "hence , we do not discuss the hard x - ray data in this paper .      _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt observed the evolution of the flare , from its very early stage , followed by an ejection of a plasmoid structure as seen in movie  1 .",
    "the corresponding large - scale feature was also observed in an extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) wavelength ( 195  ; movie  2 ) @xcite . from around 04:34  ut , the width of the portion connecting the top of the bright soft x - ray loop and the plasmoid started to decrease with time , which eventually led to the plasmoid ejection after @xmath0  04:50  ut",
    "( see figure  [ fig : microwave ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "we note that the soft x - ray intensity from the bright soft x - ray loop derived from the sxt data continued to increase as the width decreased while it turned into a decrease after the ejection , following the peak in the soft x - ray flux ( figure  [ fig : microwave ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "such behavior in soft x - rays is consistent with what is expected from the well - perceived reconnection picture for flares ( figure  [ fig : data ]  ( a ) ) @xcite , in which the observed decrease in width is attributed to reconnection inflow @xcite towards the x - point while magnetic reconnection is in progress . from the soft x - ray image at the period of ongoing reconnection ( figure  [ fig : data ]  ( c ) ) , we have identified the x - like feature at the apex of the cusp shape structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , the smallest portion in width in the soft x - ray intensity contour map ( see the contours in figure  [ fig : data ] at 04:45:00  ut ) , as the location of the reconnection x - point , which is indicated by black circles in figure  [ fig : data ]  ( b)(d ) .",
    "we consider that the x - point is located within the fixed black circles from the start of the reconnection to the plasmoid ejection , because the location of the plasmoid gradually moved upward as the flare progressed , but such moving distance is comparable to the diameter of the black circles until the plasmoid ejection at around 04:50  ut .",
    "after the plasmoid ejection , the x - point location can not be tracked , since the plasmoid was ejected outside of the field of view .",
    "additionally , the apex of the cusp shape structure shifted towards northeast direction after the plasmoid ejection .",
    "hence we move the black circle along the yellow line in figure  [ fig : data ]  ( b)(d ) to track the location around the apex of the cusp shape structure ( around the edge of the current - sheet - like feature ) as seen in movie  3 . in the following",
    ", quantities referred to as those around the x - point correspond to those averaged over the black circle .",
    "the flare was simultaneously observed in two microwave frequencies at 17  ghz and 34  ghz with the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : data ]  ( h)(j ) give maps of the brightness temperature at 17  ghz showing a similar spatial distribution as that in soft x - rays . in figure",
    "[ fig : data ]  ( k)(m ) , we present the spatial distribution of the power - law index of the microwave flux density spectra ( hereafter referred to as  alpha index \" @xcite ) derived from the brightness temperature maps at 17  ghz and 34  ghz . as the 34  ghz maps suffered from aliasing patterns from image synthesis , we carefully removed their effect before evaluating the alpha index ; the procedure for which is detailed in appendix  [ sec : calibration of 34 ghz data ] .",
    "the meaning of alpha index value is summarized in table  [ tbl : alpha index ] , based on figure  2 in @xcite . the sign of alpha index changes from positive to negative or zero at the frequency where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the optical depth ) .",
    "the degree of alpha index is determined by the emission mechanism of the microwave . as derived by @xcite , for the optically thin gyro - synchrotron emission",
    ", the alpha index @xmath3 is related to the spectral index of the accelerated electrons @xmath4 in such a way that @xmath5 .",
    "note that there is a difference between the electron spectral indices derived from microwaves @xmath4 and hard x - rays @xmath6 , since each wavelength is emitted from the electrons in different energy ranges by different emission mechanism ( _ i.e. _ , gyro - syncrotoron and bremsstrahlung , respectively ) . according to @xcite , the difference between @xmath6 derived from _",
    "yohkoh_/hxt and @xmath4 from norh is @xmath7 for 8 flare examples .",
    "we note that in figure  [ fig : data ]  ( k)(m ) , and also in movie  4 , there is a localized distribution of negative alpha index around the x - point for the period of ongoing reconnection ( at 04:45  ut ; figure  [ fig : data ]  ( l ) ) and around the timing of the plasmoid ejection ( at 04:50  ut ; figure  [ fig : data ]  ( m ) ) , while the alpha index is around zero in the early stage of the flare ( at 04:34  ut ; figure  [ fig : data ]  ( k ) ) .",
    "the degree of circular polarization at 17  ghz for the region above the bright soft x - ray ( as well as microwave ) loop was at most @xmath0  2  % so the possibility of gyro - resonance emission for this region can be safely ruled out . with this possibility excluded ,",
    "the negative values of alpha index around the x - point immediately indicate , by themselves , that the microwaves there originate from optically - thin ( gyro-)synchrotron emission by non - thermal , _ i.e. _ , accelerated , electrons of ( mildly-)relativistic energies ( see table  [ tbl : alpha index ] ) .",
    "we note that , in reality , thermal electrons should also coexist in the corona , and the observed alpha index contains contribution from both thermal and non - thermal electrons along the line - of - sight . even in this case",
    ", the negative alpha index indicates the existence of non - thermal electrons , because only the optically - thin non - thermal gyro - syncrotoron emission can cause the negative alpha index except for the optically - thin gyro - resonance emission that was excluded as mentioned above ( see table  [ tbl : alpha index ] ) , although @xmath4 can not be estimated correctly from this alpha index .",
    "the amount of the non - thermal electrons is discussed in section  [ sec : non - thermal component ] .",
    "the alpha index of @xmath0  0 in the early stage of the flare is likely due to optically - thin bremsstrahlung emission from thermal electrons at the initial stage of the acceleration process .",
    "figure  [ fig : microwave ]  ( c ) gives the temporal evolution of the alpha index around the x - point . as the reconnection proceeds towards the plasmoid ejection , the alpha index decreases to larger negative values , increasing significance of the presence of non - thermal emission there .",
    "after the ejection , the alpha index in the black circles of figure  [ fig : data ] ( that show the location of the x - point before the plasmoid ejection , and now around the edge of the current - sheet - like feature ) returned towards zero , suggesting thermalization there or evacuation of the accelerated electrons from the region .",
    "in addition to the non - thermal ( gyro-)synchrotron component discussed above , the observed microwave brightness temperature contains another component from bremsstrahlung emission by thermal electrons along the line - of - sight .",
    "since we can infer the temperature and column emission measure of the thermal electrons from the sxt images with the filter ratio method @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : sxr ] , the brightness temperature at 17  ghz expected from soft x - ray - emitting thermal plasmas , @xmath8 , can then be calculated @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : microwave ]  ( d ) . by subtracting @xmath8 from the measured brightness temperature at 17  ghz",
    ", we obtain the residual brightness temperature @xmath9 that may be a good measure of the emission from non - thermal electrons .",
    "the  non - thermal brightness temperature \" @xmath9 thus derived around the x - point rapidly increased to @xmath0  7,000  k in the early stage of the reconnection process at around 04:34  ut ( see figure  [ fig : microwave ]  ( e ) ) .",
    "it stayed around this level throughout the reconnection process until the ejection of the plasmoid .",
    "this may indicate that the electron acceleration process continued to be in operation during this period .",
    "since the temporal evolution of the alpha index and @xmath9 clearly synchronize with the reconnection process , it is most likely that the acceleration process of electrons around the x - point closely traces the progress of magnetic reconnection . after the ejection",
    ", we see drastic decrease in @xmath9 .",
    "this indicates that the electron acceleration either ceased , or weakened significantly around the edge of the current - sheet - like feature where the x - point was located before the plasmoid ejection .",
    "we have shown that there is microwave emission from non - thermal electrons most clearly seen around the x - point .",
    "this indicates that there are energetic electrons present around the x - point during the course of the magnetic reconnection .",
    "meanwhile , the soft x - ray observations of the flare were in good agreement , in a morphological sense , with the canonical reconnection picture ( figure  [ fig : data ]  ( a ) ) from which we expect , in addition to the inflow , bi - directional outflow of plasma particles and magnetic fields away from the x - point towards the bright soft x - ray loop and in the opposite direction @xcite . assuming the presence of the expected reconnection outflow , it would be reasonable to conclude that the energetic non - thermal electrons are supplied from , namely , accelerated at , the region around the x - point rather than assuming that they travel from a region lower in altitude than the x - point against the counter - streaming downward outflow , or that they come from a region higher in altitude beyond the x - point against the counter - streaming upward outflow from the x - point .",
    "the observed decreasing trend in the column emission measure ( figure  [ fig : sxr ]  ( c ) ) , _ i.e. _ , a decrease in density of soft - x - ray - emitting thermal electrons , would be due to the ambient electrons being swept away from the x - point by the reconnection outflow and/or that they departed from thermal equilibrium due to collisions with accelerated electrons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as seen in movie  4 , the negative alpha signal traveled from around the x - point to the foot point of the flare loop along the northern outer edge of the flare loop around the timing of the plasmoid ejection .",
    "this gives further support that the accelerated electrons manifesting themselves as the negative alpha signal are originated from around the x - point , although the traveling negative alpha signal does not immediately correspond to the individual energetic electrons .",
    "hence , we argue that electron acceleration around the x - point is the initial ( first - stage ) acceleration in a flare that immediately follows the onset of reconnection .",
    "we further take a closer look into the region around the x - point .",
    "the spatial extent of the negative alpha index in the lateral direction ( parallel to the solar surface ) is possibly caused by the inclined configuration of the flaring loop to the line - of - sight as reported by @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the length of the localized negative alpha index , _",
    "i.e. _ , the region where the energetic non - thermal electrons exists , has a spatial extent of @xmath0  20,000 km along the direction of the height , and is located at the top - most of the cusp structure , for the period of ongoing reconnection ( see figure  [ fig : data ]  ( l ) ) . considering this spatial extent along the direction of the height ,",
    "the possible scenarios of the electron acceleration around the x - point are follows : ( i ) an x - point alone can produce energetic electrons with the inductive reconnection electric field ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "such energetic electrons can easily escape from the x - point , and emit microwaves from a spatially extended region as seen in our data .",
    "( ii ) multi - island coalescence along a single current sheet should also be considered as an electron acceleration scenario ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "( iii ) fragmented islands scenario with multiple current sheets ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also possible , since , considering the spatial resolution of our microwave data ( @xmath0 10@xmath10 ) , the multiple current sheets can not be resolved , and the non - thermal signals in microwaves should be observed as only one source as seen in the presented data .",
    "we note that the hot thermal electrons ( @xmath11 10  mk ) spatially coexists with the energetic non - thermal electrons ( figure  [ fig : data ]  ( e)(g ) ) around the x - point .",
    "since the coronal temperature below the x - point are cooler than around the x - point , we can say that the hot plasmas around the x - point is not heated by the thermal conduction from the plasmas located below the x - point .",
    "these high temperature plasmas are directly created by the released magnetic energy that would also accelerate the electrons , and/or are the result of the thermalization of the accelerated electrons .    in our flare",
    ", we also find microwave non - thermal sources other than around the x - point ( see the negative alpha index distribution in figure  [ fig : data ] , especially in figure  [ fig : data ]  ( m ) ) .",
    "one is located at the foot points of the flaring loop .",
    "this negative alpha index is also due to the non - thermal emission , not by the gyro - resonance emission , since the sunspots were occulted by the solar disk in this flare .",
    "the other non - thermal source is distributed above the top of the flaring loop extending from the x - point region .",
    "these two kinds of observed microwave non - thermal sources became noticeable around the timing of the plasmoid ejection ( see figure  [ fig : data ]  ( m ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with the timing where intensity enhancement in the hard x - rays was observed around the timing of plasmoid ejections ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , these two kinds of the sources may have close relationship with the well known hard x - ray non - thermal sources , _",
    "e.g. _ , double - foot - point sources ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ? * ) and above - the - loop - top source ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ? * ) . considering the spatially - smooth distribution of the negative alpha index extending from the x - point region ( larger negative alpha index @xmath12 ) to above - the - loop - top region ( smaller negative alpha index @xmath13 ) at the timing when the microwave non - thermal sources became noticeable ( see figure  [ fig : data ]  ( m ) )",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that no major acceleration site other than around the x - point exists , although some additional sub - accelerations might occur in other locations .",
    "the hard x - ray above - the - loop - top source ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may appear as a lower part of the spatial distribution of non - thermal electrons from the x - point region to above the loop top manifesting themselves in microwaves ( with negative alpha index ) , and is detected due to the denser coronal plasmas near the flaring loop with which bremsstrahlung hard x - rays are efficiently emitted .",
    "meanwhile , the reconnection rate can be estimated to be @xmath0  0.017 from the data set of following parameters considering the line - of - sight effect @xcite : the inflow velocity ( @xmath0  16.3 km s@xmath14 ) derived from figure  [ fig : microwave ]  ( a ) , the foot point expanding velocity ( @xmath0  3.3 km s@xmath14 ) of the flare loop from x - ray data , the averaged magnetic field strength at the sunspot ( @xmath0  98 gauss ) from the magnetogram , and the coronal column emission measure ( @xmath15 @xmath16 that corresponds to the number density of @xmath17 @xmath18 for the line - of - sight depth of 60,000 km ) from the soft x - ray data with the filter ratio method .",
    "this reconnection rate supports the petschek type reconnection against sweet - parker type @xcite .",
    "the solar corona provides a unique opportunity for investigating the acceleration process associated with magnetic reconnection , not only in that the entire view of the reconnecting magnetic structure can be obtained by imagery , but also because the spatio - temporal evolution of any sources with certain spectral features in the dynamically - evolving reconnecting structure can be traced by imaging - spectroscopic approach . with the present result being the first step , progress in theoretical investigations as well as future observations such as from atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) @xcite with very high spatial resolution , mirror - focusing hard x - ray ( foxsi ; *",
    "* ) and soft x - ray @xcite telescopes with photon - counting capabilities should help us solve the long - standing questions about particle acceleration in solar flares .",

    "we here explain the method we devised for removing the aliasing patterns in synthesized images at 34  ghz taken with the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ) .",
    "norh is a radio interferometer dedicated for solar observations at 17 ghz and 34 ghz microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "a set of raw signals from norh gives spatial fourier components of the two - dimensional brightness distribution across the full sun , and it is necessary to reconstruct ( synthesize ) images from the set of raw data to obtain a microwave map of the sun .",
    "norh was designed to have its fundamental antenna spacing ( smallest antenna spacing ) in such a way that it can measure fourier components corresponding to 40  arcmin at 17  ghz .",
    "this implies norh is capable of synthesizing full - sun microwave maps at 17  ghz free from the aliasing effect while there are inevitable aliasing patterns present in synthesized 34  ghz maps as illustrated in figure  [ fig:34 g data ] .",
    "these aliasing patterns ( pseudo brightness temperature distribution ) drift as the azimuth and elevation of the sun seen from norh change with time ( movie  5 ) . in deriving the microwave alpha index from sets of 17  ghz and 34  ghz maps",
    ", it was crucial to correctly remove the aliasing patterns in the 34  ghz maps .    in this study",
    ", we removed only  aliasing pattern  1 \" ( hereafter ap1 ) shown in figure  [ fig:34 g data ] and movie  5 , since it is the only aliasing pattern component whose intense part passed over the flare site we analyzed ( see movie  5 ) .",
    "the effect of other aliasing patterns and residual random fluctuation in brightness temperature maps with image synthesis will be discussed later .    for the removal of ap1 ,",
    "the motion of ap1 should be tracked .",
    "however , there was no intense feature in ap1 suitable for tracking its motion .",
    "hence , we first identified the motion of the pseudo flare site produced by the aliasing effect in aliasing pattern  2 ( indicated by a blue arrow in figure  [ fig:34 g data ] and movie  5 ) using correlation tracking of the real flare site ( indicated by a red arrow in figure  [ fig:34 g data ] and movie  5 ) and the pseudo one .",
    "then , by making use of the motion of the pseudo flare site and the fact that the motions of aliasing patterns  1 and 2 are symmetric about the center of the solar disk ( see movie  5 ) , we identified the motion of ap1 .    in order to extract ap1 from the original 34 ghz map",
    ", we took the following approach .",
    "as we know the relative motion between the real sun and ap1 , instead of looking into the drifting ap1 as we see in movie  5 , we fixed the aliasing pattern spatially and let the image of the real sun drift ( figure  [ fig : track and scan ] and movie  6 ) . at sufficient heights from the microwave disk of the sun ( shown as the green - colored zone in the left - hand side of movie  6 )",
    ", we can expect that any features seen above that height , _",
    "i.e. _ , inside the green - colored zone , are of non - solar origin , that is , originate from the aliasing .",
    "this way , ap1 can be extracted from the brightness distribution in the green - colored zone by utilizing the scanning motion of the real solar disk with an assumption that ap1 was stable over the time of the observations .",
    "the resultant patterns of ap1 are shown in green in the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : track and scan ] and movie  6 .",
    "note that each point of the aliasing pattern map gives a brightness temperature for ap1 at a combination of certain time and location on the real sun . for the x - point structure discussed in the main text ,",
    "the location of ap1 that passes through the x - point region ( from 04:30:30  ut to 05:15:00  ut ) is shown in red in figure  [ fig : track and scan ] and movie  6 .",
    "an average of 60 consecutive brightness temperature maps ( each with 10-seconds accumulation time , with a duration of 10 minutes ) was taken for determining the brightness at each spatial point in ap1 .",
    "as can be seen in movie  5 , ap1 drifts through the flare site before it moves away from the limb .",
    "this means that ap1 determined in the green - colored zone lags behind the time when the corresponding portion of ap1 drifted through the flare site . in order to minimize the effect of any temporal variation in ap1 , when determining the brightness temperature at each spatial point in ap1 , the first 60 maps after the point entered into the green - colored zone were used . for the final phase of the flare ( after 05:08:20  ut ) , less than 60 maps were available because of a decrease in image quality of the synthesized 34  ghz maps after 05:38:30  ut ( which were used to determine ap1 that passed through the flare site after",
    "05:08:20  ut ) .",
    "the relationship between the time that ap1 drifted through the flare site and that of determining ap1 in the green - colored zone is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cal dataset ] .",
    "the brightness temperature distribution of ap1 thus derived was subtracted from the original 34  ghz map for each epoch during the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : cal result ] and movie  7 illustrate pre- and post - removal of ap1 around the flare site at 34  ghz where we can see that the bright features in ap1 are successfully removed . after the removal of ap1 , however , there are still some flickering features caused by ( 1 ) residual random fluctuation due to image synthesis , ( 2 ) aliasing patterns other than ap1 ( although weak in brightness ) and ( 3 ) any possible temporal variation in ap1 .",
    "let us now evaluate these effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : cal check ] indicates the variation in brightness temperature of the aliasing patterns along the red line in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : track and scan ] .",
    "note that the horizontal axis ( with a label  pixel \" ) of this figure gives the location along the red line in figure  [ fig : track and scan ] and also gives ( with a label  time \" ) the time when that location of ap1 passed the site of the x - point .",
    "for each point on the horizontal axis , the distribution in colors along the vertical axis gives the fractional distribution of the brightness temperatures among the 60 maps used ( until 05:08:10  ut ; with fewer numbers of maps after then ) .",
    "this fractional distribution reflects the stability of the brightness temperatures in the drifting aliasing pattern , with the average and standard deviation for each point on the horizontal axis shown in the same figure .",
    "the almost constant standard deviation of @xmath0  1,000  k across the entire horizontal axis location in the figure suggests that random fluctuation due to image synthesis is the main cause of this standard deviation .",
    "the amount of the standard deviation in the brightness temperature of ap1 was incorporated when obtaining the real brightness temperature by subtracting ap1 from the original 34  ghz maps .",
    "the error in the alpha index derived in main text ( error bars in figure  [ fig : microwave ]  ( c ) ) comes from this standard deviation .",
    "so far we have used the pseudo brightness temperature from ap1 , extracted from the 34  ghz maps in the time range of 04:57:00  ut05:38:30  ut , for removing the effect of ap1 that passed the x - point between 04:30:30  ut and 05:15:00  ut . there is typically a time gap of @xmath0  30 minutes present between the two ( the time gap is not constant due to the non - linear drifting motion of ap1 with respect to the real sun ) . in order to check whether the pseudo brightness temperature distribution of ap1 was stable enough over this time span",
    ", another set of brightness distribution of ap1 was extracted , by utilizing the on - disk portion of the microwave sun ( shown as a blue circle in the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : track and scan ] ) where there was little activity ( confirmed from euv images ; movie  2 ) .",
    "in such a quiet region , an almost flat distribution of 34  ghz brightness temperatures at @xmath0  9,000  k is expected @xcite .",
    "34  ghz maps from 04:05:00  ut to 04:50:40  ut were used for determining ap1 utilizing the on - disk quiet portion , by subtracting the flat disk component at 9,000  k. this gives a pseudo brightness temperature distribution from ap1 that passed the x - point from 04:40:40  ut to 05:15:00  ut as illustrated in figure  [ fig : cal dataset ] .",
    "the quality of the synthesized maps before 04:04:50  ut ( which corresponds to the x - point passage before 04:40:30  ut ) deteriorated , hence they were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the resultant average pseudo brightness temperature distribution ( each derived from 60 consecutive maps closest in time to the x - point passage ) is shown by a black line in figure  [ fig : cal check ] . throughout the period where ap1 of the pre - flare - site passage was available ( after 04:47:30  ut )",
    ", the overlaid profile falls well within the range of the standard deviation , indicated by thin white lines in the figure .",
    "thus we conclude that the brightness temperature distribution of ap1 around the flare site can be considered stable during the flare , within the range of standard deviation , supporting the validity of the method we used for removing ap1 from the 34  ghz maps of the flare .",

    "<S> it is most prominent during flares in the case of the sun , with which huge amount of electromagnetic radiation and high - energy particles are expelled into the interplanetary space through acceleration of plasma particles in the corona . though it has been well understood that energies of flares are supplied by the mechanism called magnetic reconnection based on the observations in x - rays and euv with space telescopes , where and how in the flaring magnetic field plasmas are accelerated has remained unknown due to the low plasma density in the flaring corona . </S>",
    "<S> we here report the first observational identification of the energetic non - thermal electrons around the point of the ongoing magnetic reconnection ( x - point ) ; with the location of the x - point identified by soft x - ray imagery and the localized presence of non - thermal electrons identified from imaging - spectroscopic data at two microwave frequencies . considering the existence of the reconnection outflows that carries both plasma particles and magnetic fields out from the x - point , </S>",
    "<S> our identified non - thermal microwave emissions around the x - point indicate that the electrons are accelerated around the reconnection x - point . additionally , the plasma around the x - point was also thermally heated up to 10  mk . </S>",
