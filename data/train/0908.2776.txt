    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are a ubiquitous phenomena , in a sense that most galaxies experience some sort of activity in their nucleus during their evolution .",
    "the most accepted scenario of the agn structure is that they are powered by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "one of the ways to study the inner emitting regions of an agn , is by analyzing its emission lines , i.e. the broad ( bels ) and narrow emission lines ( nels ) .",
    "so far many papers and textbooks are devoted to the physical properties of the emission line regions ( elr ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but , there are still many open issues .",
    "spectroscopy , in general , offers different methods for diagnostics of the emitting plasma ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these methods could not be properly used to probe the physical conditions in some elr of agn , as e.g. in the broad line region ( blr ) , since the forbidden lines , that are usually employed in plasma diagnostics of the narrow line region ( nlr ) or hii regions , are not present in the bels spectrum . particularly , it is difficult to find a direct method which would only use the observed bels to determine the temperature and density in the blr . on the other hand , the optical fe ii ( @xmath4 4400 - 5400  ) lines are one of the most interesting features in the agn spectrum .",
    "the origin of the optical fe ii extreme emission and the geometrical place of the fe ii emission region in agn , are still open questions .",
    "also , there are many correlations of the fe ii lines and other agn spectral properties which need physical explanation such as : ew fe ii vs. @xmath5}}{\\mathrm{ew h\\beta}}$ ] , ew fe ii vs. peak [ o iii ] , ew fe ii and fwhm of h@xmath6 , etc . @xcite .    in order to estimate the physical conditions ( such as the temperature and hydrogen density ) of the blr we use the balmer and helium line ratios obtained in two ways : ( i ) using the photoionization code cloudy , a spectral synthesis code designed to simulate conditions within a plasma and model the resulting spectrum , and ( ii ) extracting a sample of agn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) database .",
    "we investigate these line ratios in order to find conditions in the blr where so - called boltzmann - plot ( bp ) method is applicable @xcite .",
    "for these special cases , we study the correlations between the average temperature , hydrogen density and he ii / he i line ratio .",
    "moreover , we present an investigation of the optical fe ii emission in agn , for which we have used an additional sample of 111 agn from the sdss database . the strongest fe ii lines are identified and classified into four groups according to the lower level of the transition : @xmath7f , @xmath8s , @xmath7 g and @xmath9d1 . in this progress report",
    ", we report our recent investigations of the physical and kinematical properties of the blr and fe ii emitting region .",
    "this report is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the numerical simulations of the blr and briefly introduce the bp method , and give the analysis of the simulated bels ; in  3 we study the sdss sample of hydrogen balmer and helium lines , while in  4 the selection and analysis of the sdss sample of fe ii lines are given ; in  5 we discuss some results and finally , in  6 our conclusions are given .",
    "in order to study the bels , we simulated the blr emission line spectrum from different grids of the blr photoionization models using the cloudy code ( version c07.02.01 : * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "input parameters for the simulations are chosen to match the standard conditions in the blr @xcite , i.e. the solar chemical abundances , the constant hydrogen density , the code s agn template for the incident continuum shape .",
    "we compute an emission - line spectrum for the coordinate pair of hydrogen gas density @xmath10 $ ] and hydrogen - ionizing photon flux @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the grid dimensions spanned 4 orders of magnitude in each direction , and with an origin of log @xmath12 , log @xmath13 was stepped in 0.2 dex increments .",
    "a column density @xmath14 $ ] was kept constant in producing one grid of simulations . even though many authors claim that the most probable value of the blr column density is @xmath15 @xcite , we produce here 5 different grids of models changing the column density in the range @xmath16 .",
    "we further analyze the bel fluxes flux .",
    "since it has no influence in our analysis , we have used these values . ] from the cloudy grids of models .",
    "we consider in our analysis the hydrogen balmer lines ( h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 ) and the flux ratio @xmath17 of the helium lines he ii @xmath24686 and he i @xmath25876 , defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the line flux .",
    "we particularly consider these helium lines , since they are the lines of the same element but in two different ionization states , thus their ratio he ii @xmath24686/he i @xmath25876 is sensitive to the change in the temperature and density ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . besides , these lines are in the same spectral range as balmer lines . additionally , from the grids of models we consider in our analysis an averaged temperature , which is the electron temperature averaged over the blr radius ( @xmath20 further in the text ) .                  for the plasma of the length @xmath21 that emits along the line of sight ,",
    "assuming that the temperature and emitter density does not vary too much , the flux @xmath22 of a transition from the upper to the lower level ( @xmath23 ) can be calculated as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath2 is the transition wavelength , @xmath25 is the statistical weight of the upper level , @xmath26 is transition probability , @xmath27 is the averaged total number density of radiating species which effectively contribute to the line flux ( which are not absorbed ) , @xmath28 is the partition function , @xmath29 is the energy of the upper level , @xmath30 is the averaged excitation temperature , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the planck constant , the speed of light , and the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "the additional assumption made here is that the population of the upper level in the transition follows the saha - boltzmann distribution ( for more detailed derivation check * ? ? ?",
    "from the above equation comes the so - called boltzmann plot ( bp ) that can be used to estimate the excitation temperature @xmath34 in the blr @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are bp parameters , and @xmath38 is the temperature indicator .",
    "therefore , for one line series ( as e.g. balmer line series ) if the population of the upper energy states ( @xmath39 ) it is not necessary that level @xmath40 has the saha - boltzmann distribution . ] can be described with the saha - boltzmann distribution , then by applying the last equation to that line series and obtaining the value of the parameter @xmath37 , we can estimate the excitation temperature of the region where these lines are originating .",
    "we should emphasize that the additional assumption in the bp method is that the balmer lines are originating in the same emitting region .    in spite of the fact that the bp method has some obvious advantages , i.e. it is only using the measured balmer line fluxes , that are easily observed , to estimate the excitation temperature",
    ", one should take into account some possible problems that could occur when using the emission line to determine the blr physical properties : ( i ) the line profiles are usually very complex and indicate that more than one component contribute to the total line flux , therefore one should be aware of the multi - component blr structure when estimating the bel fluxes ; ( ii ) the balmer lines do not have to necessarily originate in the same region , e.g. there some indications that the h@xmath0 and h@xmath6 line are forming in two distinct regions since it has been shown that the h@xmath6 line is systematically broader than h@xmath0 @xcite ; ( iii ) there are different mechanisms contribution to the line formation .",
    "the photoionization seems to be working well , but other heating mechanisms should be taken into account .      the first step in analyzing the bel ratios is to apply the bp method on the balmer line ratios given by cloudy to estimate the parameter @xmath37 , from which we then calculate the bp temperature , i.e. the excitation temperature ( @xmath41 further in the text ) of the region where balmer lines are formed .",
    "also , from the best - fitting of the normalized line ratios , we obtain the error of the bp fit ( @xmath42 further in the text ) .",
    "a few examples of the bp applied on the balmer lines simulated with cloudy for column density of @xmath43 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] . in many cases",
    "a satisfactory bp fit is not obtained , i.e. @xmath42 has pretty large values .",
    "this is more noticeable in the case of higher values of the hydrogen density and ionizing - photon flux , hence we plot the error of the bp fit @xmath42 in the hydrogen density vs. ionizing flux plane for all 5 grids of models of different column density in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ( only the contours inside which @xmath42 is less than 10% , 20% and 30% are given ) .",
    "from fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] can be seen that if the bp method could be considered valid if @xmath42 is less than 10% ( eventually 20% in the measured spectra ) the parameter space where this is valid is pretty constrained for all column densities @xmath44 .",
    "out of all photoionization models , we select just those that follow these constraints : ( i ) the error of the bp fit @xmath42 less than 10% , ( ii ) the average temperature @xmath20 less than 20,000 k , as for larger temperatures the balmer line ratios are not sensitive to the temperature changes and the bp method can not be applied @xcite , and ( iii ) the ratio of helium lines @xmath17 less than 2 . following this criteria",
    ", we constructed 5 samples of simulated bels , of single column density , labeled as e.g. cd21 for column density @xmath45 , etc .",
    "the models that satisfy these 3 constraints are represented with asterisks in figure  [ fig01 ] .     of the emitting medium ( upper ) and the hydrogen density ( bottom ) as the function of the ratio @xmath17 of the he ii @xmath24686 and he i @xmath25876 lines , for five selected sets of simulated spectra of different column density @xmath46 .",
    "the dashed line represents the best - fitting with the function @xmath47 for the average temperature and @xmath48 for the hydrogen density .",

    "the dashed line represents the best - fitting with the function @xmath47 for the average temperature and @xmath48 for the hydrogen density .",
    "the name of the set is specified on each plot.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]      we investigate in more details the five sets of simulated spectra defined above .",
    "first , we plot the average temperature @xmath20 of the emitting region , one of the outputs of the model , with respect to the ratio @xmath17 of the helium lines for all 5 sets ( fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , upper ) .",
    "we fit data sets with the linear function @xmath49 and the best fitting results are given in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "another possible connection of the blr physical parameters and bels , can be obtained from the relation between the hydrogen density and the helium line ratio @xmath17 .",
    "we plot the logarithm of the hydrogen density and the ratio @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , bottom ) , and we fitted it with the function : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is given in the units of @xmath52 . it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ( bottom ) that even when the column density changes , the same dependance of the hydrogen density on the helium line ratio @xmath17 remains .",
    "the best fitting results are given in table [ tab01 ] .",
    ".the best - fitting parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the function @xmath55 , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the function @xmath58 for different column densities @xmath44 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this progress report we give some results of our recent investigations of different broad line parameters ( the flux ratios , ew , fwhm , etc . ) in order to probe the physics of the elr , i.e. the hydrogen balmer lines ( h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 ) , the helium lines from two subsequent ionization levels ( he ii @xmath24686 and he i @xmath25876 ) and the strongest fe ii lines in the wavelength interval @xmath59 .    from the analysis of the hydrogen balmer lines , we can say that the bp method gives valid results if the error of the bp fit @xmath42 is less than 10% ( eventually 20% in the measured spectra ) .",
    "the parameter space of cloudy simulations where @xmath60 is well constrained and in a similar range for different column densities @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "this area of parameters contains lower ionizing fluxes and higher hydrogen densities , but depending on the column density the area increases keeping the same trend between the @xmath61 and @xmath62 , therefore , for those parameters the bp method could be applied for the estimation of the excitation temperature .",
    "this indicates that for some physical conditions , even if we have the photoionization as the main heating process in the blr , the hydrogen balmer lines are produce in such way that they obey the saha - boltzmann equation , i.e. the blr plasma is at least in the partial local thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the physical parameters of the simulations for which the bp method could be applied ( @xmath60 ) follow some relations even when the column density changes .",
    "there is a linear relation between the average temperature @xmath20 of the emitting region and helium lines ratio @xmath17 : @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , table  [ tab01 ] ) . also , the hydrogen density depends on the helium line ratio @xmath17 as : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is given in the units of @xmath63 ( figure  [ fig03 ] , table  [ tab01 ] ) . for lower column densities ( @xmath64 )",
    "this linear trend for @xmath20 seems to be broken after some value of @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , upper ) , therefore the results obtained for this column densities should be taken with caution .",
    "the ranges of the average temperature and hydrogen density , obtained when these relations are applied to the observed sample of agn taken from the sdss database , are in good agreement with the previous estimates of the physical conditions in the blr @xcite . having in mind problems given in  2.1 ( i.e. different emitting regions of helium and balmer lines or the multicomponent origin of bels ) the relations given in table  [ tab01 ] could be use as a rough estimate of the blr physical parameters from direct measurements .",
    "on the other hand , from the analysis of the fe ii emission , we found the significant correlation between the fe ii and h@xmath0 , h@xmath6 ilr widths which indicate the ilr origin of the fe ii emission .",
    "also , the fe ii emission region is mainly characterized with random velocity of @xmath651800 km / s , that corresponds to the ilr origin .",
    "this result is in favor to the results obtained by @xcite , and with the recent findings that the optical fe ii line forming region seems to not be the same as the blr @xcite .",
    "moreover , we found that the degree of anticorrelation of ew fe ii - ew [ o iii ] ( ew [ o iii]/h@xmath6 ) is redshift dependent , i.e. anticorrelation increases by selection of the sample with high redshift objects .",
    "we used here the emission lines to estimate the physical parameters of the blr and properties of the fe ii line forming region . from our investigations",
    "we can outline the following conclusions :    a.   in the case of the pure photoionized plasma , there can exist the conditions that the excitation of the hydrogen balmer lines is sensitive to the temperature . in this case , the he ii / he i line ratio can be used for the estimates of the averaged temperature and hydrogen density .",
    "this can be very useful for determining the physical properties of the blr , and for a small sample of agn we found that the blr temperatures are ranging from @xmath65 5000 k to 18000 k , and hydrogen densities from 10@xmath66 @xmath67 to 10@xmath68 @xmath67 .",
    "these values of the temperature and density are expected in the blr plasma @xcite .",
    "b.   the optical fe ii emission is likely coming from a region that corresponds to the ilr .",
    "also , there is a weak correlation with the vblr component of balmer lines indicating that a fraction emitted in the fe ii lines can originate also in the blr . on the other hand",
    ", the correlation between the ew feii and ew [ oiii ] ( ew[oiii]/ew h@xmath6 ) discovered by @xcite seems to be sensitive on redshift ( or luminosity ) of agn .",
