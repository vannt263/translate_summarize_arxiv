    "our top - down approach is based on an operator theoretic measure of implementation inaccuracy , which compares the full system dynamics of the _ actually implemented _ ( _ i.e. _ , noisy ) quantum computation directly with the _ ideally defined _ ( _ i.e. _ , noiseless ) , quantum computation .",
    "this comparison is expressed by the quantum computer condition ( qcc ) , an explicit mathematical constraint which requires that the difference between the actually implemented and ideally defined computations be bounded by a parameter with a prescribed value @xcite .",
    "the qcc provides a universal framework for quantum computational fault tolerance that , concomitant to providing a means to more accurately determine error threshold values than are obtained with standard quantum fault tolerance , allows the determination of optimal error correction codes ( or error avoidance methods ) , obviating the need to make _ ad hoc _ choices .",

    "the eaoqec formulation presented here allows for new error correction and avoidance protocols beyond those already incorporated in qec , oqec , and eaqec .",

    ", we show that eaoqec is itself a special case of the qcc .",
    "the qcc compares the dynamics of the initial quantum state @xmath1 under the unitary evolution of an ideal ( noiseless ) quantum computer , @xmath47 , to the evolution of the state under the actual implementation with a real ( noisy ) quantum computer @xmath48 , by taking their difference under the schatten-1 norm : @xmath49 the left hand side , which we call the _ implementation inaccuracy _ , is the norm of the difference between the actual ( implemented ) and desired ( ideal ) final quantum states .",
    "it is bounded by @xmath50 , a prescribed accuracy required of the quantum computation .",
    "because the ideal ( unitary ) operator @xmath47 acts on _ logical _ qubits and the actual ( positive dynamical map @xcite ) implementation @xmath48 acts on the _ computational _ or physical qubits , many of which may be needed to encode one logical qubit , we introduce the pair of linking maps , @xmath51 and @xmath52 to connect the logical and computational hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "note that these maps do _ not _ represent the physical processes which encode and decode qubits .",
    "all such physical processes are , in principle , subject to noise and are therefore properly part of the dynamics represented by @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath53 , in terms of which the qcc becomes @xmath54 we take note of the fact that , in considering the properties of the implementation inaccuracy ( _ i.e. _ , the left - hand - side of either eq.[encoded_qcc ] or [ m_subsumed_qcc ] ) , its origin in an inequality that must hold for all states , @xmath1 , implicitly ascribes the operation of taking the supremum over the complete set of density matrices .",
    "the qcc concisely incorporates a complete specification of the full dissipative , decohering dynamics of the actual , practical device used as the quantum computer , a specification of the ideally - defined quantum computation intended to be performed by the computer , and a quantitative criterion for the accuracy with which the computation must be executed given the inevitability of residual errors surviving even after error correction has been applied .",
    "thus , the qcc provides a rigorous universal , high level framework allowing for the top - down analysis of fault tolerant quantum computation .        as a universal framework for quantum computation",
    "we now show that the qcc incorporates eaoqec , and thus oqec , eaqec , and qec as well , as special cases .",
    "( in the following section , we demonstrate that the qcc goes beyond quantum error correction and provides a superoperator approach to quantum fault - tolerance . )",
    "the error correction condition of eaoqec is given by : @xmath55 this can be rewritten as : @xmath56 which is a special case of the qcc with @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( we note that quantum error correction in general protects quantum information that traverses a quantum communications channel , and that such a channel can be regarded as a quantum computer that implements the identity operation ) , and @xmath59 .",
    "( note that the noiseless linking maps @xmath51 and @xmath52 are subsumed in the definitions of @xmath26 and @xmath32 . )",
    "thus eaoqec is a special case of the qcc , and , given the discussion immediately following eq.([eaoqec ] ) , we see that all known protocols for quantum computational error correction and avoidance therefore arise as special cases of the qcc as well .",
    "the relationship among the different categories of error correction is depicted in figure [ fig : qechierarchy ] .",
    "in the previous section we showed that the qcc provides a universal framework that encompasses all of the known approaches to quantum error correction and avoidance . in this section",
    "we apply the qcc to the further problem of quantum fault tolerance .",
    "we will show that the use of the qcc leads naturally to a top - down approach to the problem of quantum computational fault tolerance . in this top - down approach ,",
    "the success criterion for fault tolerance is expressed in terms of operator norms that characterize the difference between the quantum state produced by the actual quantum computer and the desired quantum state which would be produced by a perfect , noiseless quantum computer .",
    "we refer to this top - down approach as operator quantum fault tolerance ( oqft ) by virtue of the fact that the approach is based on operator theory .",
    "oqft thus generalizes standard quantum fault tolerance theory in a manner analogous to the generalization of qec by oqec .",
    "our approach is to be contrasted with the standard , bottom - up approach in which the success criterion is expressed in terms of derived error probabilities , without reference to a quantification of the effects of the errors on the quantum state itself .",
    "an advantage of the top - down approach is that it allows for more accurate computation of error - thresholds .",
    "the quantum error correction and avoidance techniques discussed in the previous section are designed to protect quantum information as it traverses a quantum _",
    "channel_. thus , in the statement of the qcc , the desired unitary operation is simply the identity @xmath58 .",
    "quantum fault tolerance applies to the more general case of quantum _ computation _ , where @xmath60 in general .",
    "quantum fault tolerance also allows for the possibility that errors may arise during the execution of the quantum error correction / avoidance algorithm itself .",
    "the presence of a non - zero @xmath50 in the right hand side of the qcc corresponds to the realization that , despite our encoding efforts , there is always some residual error in the final state of the quantum computation .",
    "thus , the qcc provides a proper framework for the study of quantum fault tolerance , the procedure of producing the ( nearly ) correct final quantum state .    in order to deduce the conditions required for fault - tolerance",
    ", we proceed by examining the consequences of concatenating a quantum error - correction code or an error - avoidance method , labeling the successive levels of concatenation by the index @xmath61 . at each level of concatenation",
    ", the implementation inaccuracy is given by @xmath62 we may now write down the condition that comprises oqft .",
    "fault tolerance is deemed successful at a given level of concatenation if the implementation inaccuracy at concatenation level @xmath63 is less than the implementation inaccuracy at level @xmath64 , that is , if @xmath65 where the supremum operation arises in accordance with the discussion immediately following eq.([m_subsumed_qcc ] ) .",
    "the oqft condition , the inequality appearing in ( [ sup_bound ] ) , is a completely general , operator - theoretic condition that must be satisfied in order to achieve fault tolerant operation of a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "this is a top - down condition , obtained within the framework provided by the qcc , that allows for more accurate determination of error thresholds than is possible in the standard , bottom - up approach , as we will see in the following example .",
    "the example also illustrates that the standard bottom - up approach to fault tolerance arises as a special case of the oqft condition given in ( [ sup_bound ] ) .",
    "we illustrate the application of eq.([sup_bound ] ) to fault tolerance with the following example .",
    "we first introduce an operator , @xmath66 , presumed to act on the computational hilbert space , that faithfully implements the effect of the unitary operator @xmath47 ( which acts on the smaller , logical hilbert space ) : @xmath67 = u \\rho u^\\dag.\\ ] ] we now introduce a dynamical model for the evolution of the state of the quantum computer , at a given level of concatenation @xmath64 , including computational errors , given by : @xmath68 where @xmath69 depends on the probability for the occurrence of errors and @xmath70 is a superoperator that represents the effects of the errors in the computational hilbert space .",
    "note that the superoperator , @xmath71 , is a linear combination of the operator , @xmath66 , and the superoperator , @xmath72 .",
    "the above model used in the present example is sufficiently general to include , as special cases , local stochastic noise and locally correlated stochastic noise , the models that define standard quantum fault - tolerance @xcite .",
    "the implementation inaccuracy is then @xmath73 \\\\   & \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; + \\epsilon^{(i ) }                \\tilde{q}^{\\left ( i \\right ) } \\rho - u \\rho u^\\dag { \\big \\|}_1 ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have absorbed the linking maps into @xmath74 . with ( [ eq : perfectcircuit ] ) the implementation inaccuracy",
    "then reduces to the simple form @xmath75 the oqft success criterion given by eq.([sup_bound ] ) then becomes @xmath76 note that this differs in an important way from the criterion used in standard treatments of fault tolerance , which is based _ solely on a comparison of error probabilities _ :",
    "@xmath77 equation ( [ eq : epsnormratio ] ) _ takes explicitly into account the fact that the error dynamics associated with residual errors in general differs at each level of concatenation _ , namely , that @xmath78 .",
    "if the dynamical effects of the errors tend to become smaller at higher levels of concatenation , quantum fault tolerance can be achieved at error thresholds larger than those predicted by standard fault tolerance theory .",
    "this improvement in error threshold values arises due to the correction provided by the ratio of dyamical factors derived from the implementation inaccuracy .      as a concrete example of eqs .",
    "10 and 15 we analyze a case where we attempt to store one qubit of information , and thus have @xmath79 , using an error correction code .",
    "we assume a general environment with two independent noise generators : one causing bit - flips with probability @xmath80 , and the other phase - flips with probability @xmath81 .",
    "for simplicity we assume perfect readout and recovery operations .",
    "we note that the case of unbalanced noise generators ( _ i.e. _ , biased noise ) is physically important , and achieving fault tolerance in such an environment has been the subject of recent analysis @xcite .",
    "the final state of the one qubit of information after encoding , occurrence of errors , and any attempts at recovery , and decoding if necessary , will be : @xmath82 where @xmath83 for @xmath84 , the @xmath85 are the pauli operators , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and the @xmath88 are functions of the concatenation level , @xmath64 , the noise generators represented by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the error correcting code , and the recovery operation .",
    "we emphasize the dependence of @xmath88 on the concatenation level , noting that if the concatenation procedure is working properly , the quantity @xmath69 should decrease with increasing @xmath64 .",
    "we now calculate the supremum of the implementation inaccuracy at the @xmath64th concatenation level using eq .

    "we further note that the formulation of eaoqec given in @xcite is defined within the stabilizer formalism , whereas the formulation of eaoqec given in the present paper allows for non - stabilizer codes , such as non - additive codes , in addition to stabilizer codes .    finally , we recapitulate that we have shown that all forms of error correction and error avoidance are in fact special cases of the more fundamental qcc ( with @xmath105 and @xmath58 in either eq.([encoded_qcc ] ) or ( [ m_subsumed_qcc ] ) ) , and that the qcc ( with @xmath106 and @xmath47 arbitrary in either eq.([encoded_qcc ] ) or ( [ m_subsumed_qcc ] ) ) provides a universal operator theoretic framework for quantum fault tolerance , as demonstrated in the present paper",

    "in addition to eaqec , ref . @xcite introduces a protocol based on eaqec called catalytic operator quantum error correction .",
    "it is straightforward to show that catalytic operator quantum errror correction is also a special case of the eaoqec protocol that we introduce in the current paper , and hence is a special case as well of the qcc .",
    "the qcc holds for the general case of positive dynamical maps , of which completely - positive dynamical maps are a special case .",
    "this can be illustrated with the example of the @xmath107-qubit steane code , for which the computational hilbert space consists of @xmath107 computational qubits for every logical qubit .",
    "we stress that the linking maps @xmath52 and @xmath51 do not represent transformations carried out by physical devices but simply increase or decrease the hilbert space dimension , thus going from the logical to computational hilbert space and _ vice - versa_. for many purposes it is not necessary to explicitly write out the linking maps .",
    "nevertheless , it is necessary to do so in our discussion of quantum fault - tolerance , _ cf _ eqs.([eq : perfectcircuit ] ) and ( [ eq : errormodel ] ) .",

    "i.e. _ , so - called two - way , and graph state - based ( including cluster state - based ) , _ i.e. _ , so - called one - way , quantum computation .",
    "this is because in our approach the specification of the actual quantum computation occurs in the content of the positive dynamical map , @xmath48 , that is part of the implementation inaccuracy , _ i.e. _ , the left - hand - side of eq.([encoded_qcc ] ) . for",
    "either a circuit - based or graph state - based quantum computation , the dynamical evolution of the state will be described by some positive dynamical map , @xmath48 , and hence the framework presented in this paper will in general apply .",
