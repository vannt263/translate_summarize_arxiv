    "since the time that the first spectra of comets were obtained , it has been remarked that all cometary spectra are very similar , with the most marked difference being the amount of continuum present .",
    "this simple observation leads to the question of whether all comets share the same composition or if there are comets with fundamentally different compositions .",
    "if differences are seen , then an additional question of the origin of the differences would be raised : are differences the result of different formational scenarios or different evolutionary scenarios ? these questions are not just curiosities .",
    "we believe that comets are leftovers from the formation of the solar system , that they have undergone only small changes since their time of formation , and that they represent the building blocks of the jovian planets .",
    "thus , understanding their chemistry is important for our understanding of the conditions at the start of the formation of the solar system .    with these questions in mind , we began a program in 1980 to obtain spectra of comets using low resolution spectrographs at mcdonald observatory .",
    "this program continued through 2008 .",
    "we obtained observations of 132 different comets , some at more than one apparition .",
    "this paper reports on the observations of 130 of those comets .",
    "29p / schwassmann - wachmann  1 is left out because its almost - circular , 5au orbit and random outbursts make it an unusual comet that has been described in several previous papers ( cochran _ et al .",
    "_ 1980 , 1982 , 1991a , 1991b ; cochran and white 1993 ) .",
    "d / shoemaker - levy 9 broke into many pieces prior to impacting jupiter in 1994 .",
    "observations of the pieces had to be obtained in a different manner from the other comets and these are detailed in cochran _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "some of the comets described in this present paper were already discussed in prior papers ( e.g. cochran _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 , 1989 , 1992 , 2009 ; cochran and barker 1987 ) .",
    "they are included again for completeness so that all the observations can be found in the same place .",
    "in addition , all observations were analyzed in a consistent manner in this paper .",
    "thus , this paper supersedes its predecessors .",
    "this is not the only survey of its kind to be carried out .",
    "et al . ( 1995 , hereafter ah95 ) reported on observations of photometry of 85 comets .",
    "fink ( 2009 , hereafter f09 ) presented spectroscopic observations of 92 comets .",
    "langlund - shula and smith ( 2011 , hereafter ls11 ) observed 26 comets .",
    "we will compare our results with these studies near the end of this paper .",
    "the observations described in this paper were obtained with three different instruments on two telescopes at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the vast majority of the observations were obtained with two spectrographs at the cassegrain focus of the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope .",
    "a few observations were obtained at the cassegrain focus of the 2.1 m otto struve telescope .",
    "the earliest observations were obtained with the intensified dissector scanner ( ids ) spectrograph on the 2.7 m telescope . this instrument had two @xmath2 arcsec apertures , separated by 52 arcsec along an east / west line , that were imaged on a photocathode .",
    "spectra were obtained by rapidly scanning the complete wavelength range , which was typically 3200  6000 , at 11  resolution .",
    "a complete spectral scan took 50 sec so all wavelengths were essentially observed simultaneously .",
    "the comet optocenter was alternately imaged through the `` a '' slit with the `` b '' slit imaging 52 arcsec away in the coma .",
    "then the telescope was nodded to image the comet in b and coma in a. the sequence generally went abba .",
    "sometimes , the telescope was set so that the comet optocenter was between the slits or at some other known position and spectra were obtained without nodding the telescope .",
    "scans were repeated until sufficient signal / noise was obtained .",
    "the photocathode made the instrument extremely sensitive .",
    "thus , we were able to obtain spectra of comets as faint as v=19.5 .",
    "however , it also made it impossible to observe very bright objects .",
    "thus , our standard stars were limited to those that were fainter than v=10 and were taken from the list of stone ( 1977 ) .",
    "in addition , we were not able to obtain observations of solar analog stars with this instrument ( none are faint enough ) and had to use fluxes from the arvesen _",
    "( 1969 ) atlas convolved with the slit function of the instrument .",
    "the arvesen _",
    "_ atlas is a whole - disk integrated high - resolution atlas suitable for our purposes .",
    "it is not the only available atlas and there are known differences in the flux calibration between the arvesen _",
    "_ atlas and other atlases , especially below 4000 .",
    "thus , the arvesen _",
    "_ atlas might not be a perfect match for the sun .",
    "however , because we color weight the solar spectrum ( see discussion below ) before we use it , the most critical feature for our purposes is that the lines are correct in wavelength and strength .",
    "the arvesen _",
    "_ atlas is quite acceptable for our purposes .",
    "the second instrument to be used was the large cassegrain spectrograph ( lcs ) at the 2.7 m telescope .",
    "this was a long slit ccd spectrograph with various gratings .",
    "the bulk of the observations were obtained with a grating set to cover the spectral range from 3000 ",
    "5700  at 7.5  resolution .",
    "occasionally , we tilted the grating further to the red to observe other features or used a higher resolving power grating to study some bands in more detail .",
    "the slit was @xmath3arcsec long and could be oriented at any position angle by rotating the instrument on the back of the telescope .",
    "each pixel on the detector covered a spatial interval of 1.28arcsec .",
    "the slit width was variable but was typically set to 2arcsec for comet observations and 10arcsec for standard star observations",
    "( so that no flux was lost ) . generally , solar analog stars were observed at least once per run and often every night . when not observed for whatever reason , convolution of the slit function with the arvesen _",
    "( 1969 ) atlas was used for a solar spectrum .    with the lcs",
    ", we would always observe with the optocenter imaged on the chip at least once every night .",
    "we would then sometimes translate the slit under very accurate telescope control to extend our coverage into the coma .",
    "some nights we also observed at more than one position angle .",
    "the third instrument was the electronic spectrograph number 2 ( es2 ) , used on the 2.1 m telescope .",
    "this instrument is very similar to the lcs and even used the same detectors .",
    "the slit position angle could also be changed by rotating the instrument on the back of the telescope . unlike the lcs , we could not image additional regions of the coma because the 2.1 m telescope can not be positioned accurately enough .",
    "figure  [ devico ] shows a spectrum obtained with the lcs of comet 122p / de  vico on 27 september 1995 ut .        this is a very clean spectrum covering @xmath4arcsec around the optocenter .",
    "the various features observed in our bandpass are noted on the figure .",
    "these are all molecular emission bands and are composed of many individual lines that we do not resolve .",
    "this comet had a very low dust - to - gas ratio so there is very little continuum to be seen .",
    "the oh , nh and cn features tend to be relatively sharp and narrow and are easy to see and measure .",
    "the c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 bands are broad and can easily be lost in noise when weaker , in spectra with lower signal / noise or when the continuum due to sunlight reflecting off the dust is very strong .",
    "the latter is a problem because the continuum removal can represent a large source of uncertainty and add noise to the result , even when the signal / noise of the comet spectrum is very high .",
    "the continuum decreases faster with cometocentric distance than does the c@xmath1 or c@xmath0 band strength , so this is more of a problem on the optocenter points than further into the coma .",
    "the ch is always very weak and difficult to measure . in the vast majority of the spectra reported in this paper ,",
    "our bandpass included the features due to cn , c@xmath0 , ch , and c@xmath1 .",
    "we could never measure oh and nh@xmath1 simultaneously because , as shown in the spectrum , the wavelength separation is beyond the bandpass of the instrument ( only part of the nh@xmath1 is seen on this spectrum ) .",
    "in addition , high airmass makes observation of the oh very difficult ( though ironically , the de  vico spectrum was obtained when the comet was at 2.5airmasses and we were able to observe the oh in this comet even when it was at 3.8airmasses ( ! ) because the comet was so close to the sun ) .    the ids was used from 1980 through 1989 .",
    "we started using the lcs in 1985 .",
    "thus , there was a period from 1985  1989 when we interchanged which instrument was used ( for reasons that have long since been forgotten ! ) .",
    "the lcs was used with an rca @xmath5 pixel ccd from 1985 through 1986 .",
    "this detector did not have uv response so was used in a redder setting but with more limited bandpass because of the smaller number of pixels than the subsequent ccd . from 1988 , we used a texas instruments @xmath6 pixel ccd that was uv sensitized .",
    "we also used the texas instrument ccd on es2 . in all cases ,",
    "the telescope was tracked at the comet s rate of motion on the sky and we guided the telescope directly off the slit .",
    "thus , positional accuracy was generally quite good .",
    "as would be expected with a survey that spanned so many years , we changed our observational philosophy during the course of the survey . when we started , we wanted to be as inclusive as possible and would observe as many comets to v@xmath719.5 as we could .",
    "we therefore sometimes observed comets at heliocentric distances greater than 2.5au , where they were generally not very active .",
    "we sometimes also sacrificed signal / noise for the opportunity to observe another comet .",
    "we might only observe a particular comet on a single night .    as our survey progressed and",
    "as we changed instruments , we tended to concentrate more on targets that were brighter and at smaller heliocentric distances .",
    "we chose opportunities to observe the same comet repeatedly over opportunities to observe additional comets .",
    "in addition , comets of special interest ( mission targets , close approaches , etc . ) began to dominate the survey . starting in 1995 , whenever a comet was bright enough",
    ", we would observe at very high spectral resolution instead of with the instruments described here . those observations",
    "are not included in this paper .",
    "the routine reduction of the data is very similar for each of the instruments .",
    "first , we removed the bias for the ccds ( the ids did not have a bias ) and flat fielded the data . since the ccd instruments ( lcs and es2 ) are long slit instruments , we extracted the stellar spectra using variance weighting ( an estimation of the variance created from a noise model based on the gain and readnoise parameters and a smooth profile function ) of the slit profile to collapse the stellar spectral image into a 1d spectrum .",
    "the comet spectra for the ccd instruments were left as 2d spectral images .",
    "for all instruments , we observed arc lamps in order to define the wavelength correspondence of each pixel .",
    "for the ids , we used a fifth or sixth order polynomial to fit the dispersion . for the lcs",
    ", we needed to fit the wavelength in both the spectral and spatial directions .",
    "we used a fifth order polynomial in the spectral direction and a fourth order polynomial in the spatial direction .",
    "we would use our spatial fit to transform the spectral image so that the spectra were aligned with rows and the spectrum was no longer curved along the chip .",
    "finally , the cometary and solar analog spectra were flux calibrated with the standard star observations to convert the spectra into flux versus wavelength .",
    "the cometary spectrum consists of an amalgamation of two types of contributions .",
    "the coma gas yields a molecular band spectrum in emission , generally from resonance fluorescence .",
    "sunlight reflecting off the dust creates a continuum underlying the gas spectrum .",
    "in addition , there is a third spectrum superimposed on the cometary spectrum and that is the spectrum of the earth s atmosphere ( the telluric night sky emission spectrum ) .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we are interested in the quantities of the gases that are imaged through our aperture .",
    "thus , we need to remove both the telluric night sky emission spectrum and the solar spectrum .",
    "the most prominent telluric feature in our spectrum is the o  ( @xmath8s ) feature at 5577 .",
    "the telluric spectrum also has bands in the uv that must be removed . to remove the telluric spectrum , we would use either a dedicated sky observation ( always the case for the ids ) , obtained well removed from any comet , or we would use the spectrum at the end of the long slit ( for the lcs and es2 ) if a comet was not very extended and there were no gas features seen in that part of the spectral image .",
    "we would weight the sky spectrum by using the strength of the 5577  band above the local continuum and then would subtract the sky spectrum from the comet spectrum .",
    "note that , for many comets , there is the c@xmath1 @xmath9 band in the region of the 5577  line so we needed to define the continuum with respect to this band . because the 5577  feature is by far the dominant telluric signal , slight mis - weighting of the telluric spectrum was not terribly critical except for the c@xmath1 @xmath10 band .",
    "we never use this band in our analysis because there could be uncertainties induced in it by this process .",
    "we see no other strong telluric features ( mcdonald observatory does not suffer from street lighting induced features ) .",
    "there are some weak features seen , including the herzberg bands of o@xmath11 , predominantly below 3600 .",
    "some comets have very strong continuum spectra because their comae contain a great deal of dust to reflect sunlight ; others have very weak continua . to remove the solar spectrum",
    ", it would be ideal to have observations of the sun observed with the same instrument .",
    "this is not possible .",
    "the next best thing would be to observe a star that is a strong match to the properties of the sun .",
    "none of the tabulated solar analogs is fainter than v=10 so we were not able to observe them with the ids , as noted above .",
    "for the lcs and es2 , we could observe solar analogs but considerations such as weather or availability meant that we did not always observe one .",
    "the final resort for a solar spectrum was to use a full disk spectrum of the sun .",
    "these are typically observed at high spectral resolution and must be convolved with a slit function to match our instrumental resolution .",
    "we adopted the solar spectrum of arvesen _ et al . _",
    "( 1969 ) for this purpose .",
    "it should be noted that the small particles of dust in the coma result in the spectrum of the reflected sunlight being reddened when it is reflected off the dust .",
    "thus , the solar spectrum does not exactly match the continuum we wish to remove . to fix this problem , we measured the flux in up to 11 continuum bandpasses in both the comet and the solar spectrum and weighted the solar spectrum to match the same color .",
    "use of so many continuum regions allows us to match any non - linear reddening that exists .",
    "we used a smooth spline function to fit these continuum regions .",
    "the resultant weighting curve was never a straight line .",
    "this color weighted spectrum was then removed from the comet spectrum .",
    "this process would alleviate any issues with the uv - blue flux calibration of the arvesen _",
    "( 1969 ) atlas or with stars of slightly different colors than the sun .",
    "in the case of the ids , each observation would contain spectra of two positions - often the optocenter and 52 arcsec away .",
    "each position was handled separately in the process described above .",
    "the off position still included the coma of the comet so was not used as a source of a sky spectrum unless the off spectrum was devoid of any emissions .",
    "for the lcs and es2 , the long slit covers @xmath12110 pixels spatially . for high signal / noise lcs or es2 spectra",
    ", we would treat each spatial pixel as a separate spectrum for the telluric and solar removal . for lower signal / noise observations ,",
    "we would sometimes bin together pixels in the spatial direction and then apply the removal of the telluric and solar spectra ( the concept of binning does not apply to the ids ) .",

    "s ) band in the telluric spectrum .",
    "the o@xmath11 herzberg bands are also marked .",
    "the continuum results from sunlight reflecting off the dust .",
    "the middle panel shows the same spectrum but with the telluric spectrum removed using an independent observation of the sky .",
    "the bottom panel shows that spectrum after the removal of the solar continuum . in this case",
    ", the spectrum of solar analog hyades 64 was removed after weighting the continuum to match the colors of the star and the dust ( see text ) . ]",
    "the optocenter spectrum has the strongest continuum .",
    "the continuum due to the dust weakens faster with spatial distance from the optocenter than does the gas emission .",
    "once the telluric and solar spectra were removed , we could now measure the quantity of gas in each emission band .",
    "first , we fit a continuum to the region around each of the molecular bands of interest , removed the continuum and integrated the flux above the continuum .",
    "though there should be no continuum left after removal of the telluric and solar spectra , in reality , the color weighting is imperfect because there are few true continuum regions for the weighting .",
    "the fitted continuum at this point provides a consistent level to integrate above .",
    "the integrated fluxes are then converted to column densities using the standard efficiency factors listed in table  [ gfactors ] .",

    ". this will always be the case in the outer coma .",
    "for a few of the most active comets , the collisional zone might be big enough to affect the inner pixel .",
    "however , our pixels are generally much larger than the affected region .",
    "one comet for which this would be a problem if it had been observed near 1au is comet c/1995  o1 ( hale - bopp ) .",
    "however , as our observations were at 4au , this is not a problem for our data .",
    "note that at this point we generally had column densities for each observed molecule at multiple positions within the coma . for some comets",
    ", we might just have an optocenter point , while for others we had many hundreds of data points , covering distances to greater than 10@xmath18 km from the optocenter .",
    "figure  [ halley ] shows an example of the column densities as a function of position for comet halley obtained using both the lcs and ids .    ; the velocity , vel , is in km sec@xmath14 ; the heliocentric distance , r@xmath19 , in in au . ]    we needed a way to be able to intercompare comets that had disparate numbers of observed positions in the coma and a variety of observed molecules .",
    "we did this by modeling the comets using the computationally simple haser ( 1957 ) model .",
    "the haser model is not very physical as it assumes that the cometary comae are spherically symmetric and that all gas only flows outwards from the nucleus .",
    "as we will show later , spherical symmetry is often violated .",
    "we also expect that dissociation will allow the daughter species to travel in any random direction . despite these shortcomings , we still chose to use this model because it is an easy way to intercompare comets and to compare with other researchers .",
    "we adopted the haser model scale lengths listed in table  [ scalelengths ] for this purpose .",

    "our choice of scale lengths , as compared with other authors , is discussed later . in addition , we use a modified delsemme ( 1982 ) velocity scaling law of @xmath24 for the models .    table  [ prodrates ] is representative of the information that we gathered for each comet .    [ cols=\"<,>,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     inspection of table  [ dynamical ] shows that the averages are indistinguishable for oh ( with only 1 halley type comet with oh the deviation of this group is not meaningful ) , or c@xmath0 .",
    "ch and nh@xmath1 might show differences with dynamical type but the error bars are large ( and overlapping ) and there is no obvious sequence with current orbit size . for nh",
    ", there appears to be a significant difference between jfcs and lpcs ( again htcs do not have enough data to be meaningful ) but the error bars are overlapping . for c@xmath1 , there is a significant difference between jfcs and other dynamical types , though lpcs and htcs are identical .",
    "this trend for c@xmath1 is consistent with us finding many more jfcs that are depleted and is in agreement with the trend found by ah95 .",
    "we concur with their conclusion that the compositional similarities between dynamical types are suggestive that the interiors of comets are similar to their exteriors .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "ls11 reported a trend that the c@xmath1 , nh and nh@xmath1 increased in a regular fashion as the comet orbits became larger ( though their table  12 shows the c@xmath1/cn decreasing from htcs to lpcs and being the same for dynamically new and htcs ) .",
    "perhaps the differences we see for a large number of jfcs is the result of evolutionary differences instead of formational differences . while we can not categorically refute this concept , we point to observations of comet 73p / schwassmann - wachmann 3 ( sw3 ) as evidence to the contrary .",
    "comet sw3 split into several pieces in 1995 .",
    "it made a close approach to the earth in 2003 and was extensively studied .",

    "_ 2007 , jehin _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 , weaver _",
    "_ 2008 , schleicher and bair 2011 ) , suggesting that the comet was the same composition throughout .",
    "sw3 is a jfc that is depleted .",
    "therefore , its depletion is not just a surface effect .",
    "ah95 found a trend of dust - to - gas ratio as a function of cometary perihelion distance ( their figure  4 ) .",
    "with our small apertures , we do not feel comfortable computing a@xmath25 so can not comment on whether our data show such a trend .",
    "we did , however , examine the production rate ratios as a function of cometary perihelion distance .",

    "we find no believable trend of the production rate ratios with perihelion distance .",
    "when we began this survey in 1980 , we fully expected that we would find some comets with very different spectra than the vast majority of comets .",
    "instead , we found a mostly homogeneous group of objects with subtle compositional differences .",
    "in particular , we found :    * the vast majority of comets have remarkably similar compositions .",
    "* there exists a group of comets which are depleted in the carbon - chain molecules . using a very strict definition of carbon - chain depletion requiring depletion in both c@xmath1 and c@xmath0",
    ", we find that 9% of the comets are depleted .",
    "using a more relaxed definition that requires only the c@xmath1 be depleted ( similar to other authors ) , we find 25% of the comets are depleted .",
    "this is consistent with other authors .",
    "* for the most part , we agree with other studies on which individual comets show depletions .",
    "* carbon - chain depleted comets can be of any dynamical type ( though we did not observe any htcs with depletion our htc sample is very small ) . *",
    "using the relaxed definition , two thirds of the depleted comets are jfcs and one third are lpcs ( with the stricter definition it is 80% and 20% respectively ) . * depleted comets make up 37% of the jfcs and 18.5% of the lpcs . * on average , there are few differences in composition with increasing current orbit semi - major axis .",
