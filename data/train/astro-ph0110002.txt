    "the simplest model of the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) involves a spherical relativistic blast wave expanding into a constant - density , presumably interstellar , medium @xcite .",
    "the afterglows are emitted by nonthermal electrons accelerated at the shock front to an energy distribution usually assumed to be a power law above some cutoff determined by the shock velocity .",
    "the predicted power - law decay of the afterglow emission with time was subsequently observed at x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite wavelengths for grb 970228 , giving basic confirmation to this now `` standard '' picture @xcite .    to date",
    ", nearly 50 grb afterglows have been observed at more than one frequency ( for reviews of afterglow observations see chapters by piro , pian & fruchter , and weiler ) .",
    "a dozen or so of these are well observed at multiple frequencies to allow for detailed modeling .",
    "some features of these afterglows turn out to be difficult to accommodate in the standard model .",
    "the most noticeable is the relatively steep decline of the optical light curves , sometimes preceded by flatter evolution .",
    "the steep decline is usually attributed to a collimated or jet - like , rather than spherical , initial energy injection @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it could be due to the transition of blast wave evolution to the non - relativistic regime @xcite , a non - standard electron energy distribution @xcite , and/or expansion into a wind - type ambient medium @xcite .",
    "the question of a wind versus a constant - density surrounding medium is a crucial one for the progenitors of grbs , since massive stars , one of the leading candidates for grb progenitors @xcite , should be surrounded by a wind . in contrast , grbs resulted from compact star mergers , the other leading candidate , are expected to be surrounded by the general interstellar medium ( see chapter by waxman ) .",
    "the plan of the chapter is as follows . in   [ ambient ] , we discuss the likely environments of grbs relevant to afterglow evolution . in ",
    "[ model ] , we outline the basics of various ambient interaction models for grb afterglows .",
    "these models are then applied to individual grbs with relatively well - observed afterglows (   [ application ] ) .",
    "we find that some of the sources are probably wind - interactors , while others are better modeled as interacting with a constant - density medium .",
    "this and other results are discussed in   [ discussion ] .",
    "models for the grb afterglows indicate that the emission comes from a region @xmath0 cm from the source of the explosion .",
    "the nature of the material in this region depends on the grb progenitors , which are presently not known .",
    "there are two main possibilities . in one model ,",
    "the progenitors are massive stars at the end of their lives @xcite . in this case",
    ", the interaction is expected to be primarily with the mass loss from the progenitor leading up to the explosion .",
    "the other class of object is the merger of two compact objects for which there are a number of possibilities @xcite . in this case",
    ", there may be some debris from the merger , but the interaction is expected to be primarily with the ism ( interstellar medium ) .",
    "we consider these possibilities in turn .",
    "if the progenitors are massive stars , there is an analogy to the explosions of core collapse supernovae , for which there is abundant evidence that they are interacting with the winds from the progenitor stars ( see chapter by chevalier & fransson ) . in general",
    ", the interaction appears to be with the free wind from the progenitor star , with density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass loss rate from the star and @xmath3 is the wind velocity . in most of the supernova cases ,",
    "the radial range that is observed is out to a few @xmath4 cm , so that the mass loss characteristics have not substantially changed during the time that mass is supplied to the wind and @xmath5 .",
    "the density in the wind depends on the type of progenitor .",
    "red supergiant stars , which are thought to be the progenitors of most type ii supernovae , have slow dense winds .",
    "wolf - rayet stars , which are thought to be the progenitors of type ib and ic supernovae , have faster , lower density winds .",
    "sn 1987a is a special case in which the star was a red supergiant , but became a blue , b3 supergiant about @xmath6 years before the explosion ( see chapter by mccray ) .",
    "the result was a complex circumstellar medium , including a dense ring at a radius of @xmath7 cm .",
    "if grbs do have massive star progenitors , there are a number of arguments suggesting that wolf - rayet stars are the most likely progenitors : ( 1 ) sn 1998bw , the best case of a sn  grb association ( grb 980425 ) , was of type ic , with a probable wolf - rayet progenitor .",
    "( 2 ) the high energy of grbs suggest that a moderately massive black hole is involved , which , in turn , requires a massive , @xmath8 , progenitor @xcite .",
    "these stars are likely to be wolf - rayet stars at the end of their lives @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the relativistic flow from a central object may be able to penetrate a relatively compact wolf - rayet star , but probably can not penetrate an extended red supergiant star @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) if a rapidly rotating black hole is required for the grb explosion , a merger at the center of a massive star is one way to obtain a rapidly rotating core .",
    "the merger process can give rise to a wolf - rayet star .",
    "none of these arguments is definitive , but they do point toward the most plausible progenitors .",
    "the circumstellar medium created by a @xmath9 initial mass star that passes through a wolf - rayet phase and a prior red supergiant phase has been simulated by garcia - segura et al .",
    "they find that during the wolf - rayet phase , a broken shell is created at a radius of a few pc or more .",
    "this type of shell has been observed around a number of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "inside of the shell is a region of shocked wind , with an approximately constant density @xcite .",
    "the size of the shocked region is determined by what is required to decelerate the wind and is typically less than half of the shell radius . in general , the wind ram pressure @xmath10 determines the size of the wind bubble that is created .",
    "the pressure is @xmath11 @xmath12 k , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 cm s@xmath15 , and @xmath16 cm . for comparison ,",
    "the interstellar pressure in the solar neighborhood is @xmath17 @xmath12 k. the region out to the wind termination shock can be described by a density @xmath18 g @xmath12 , where @xmath19 . considering the radial range relevant to grb afterglows",
    ", we expect this to apply to most cases , unless the wind is especially weak or the surrounding pressure is extraordinarily high .",
    "ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "@xcite have followed the circumstellar mass loss from wolf - rayet stars and found that the free wind does not extend to large radii in their treatment .    for bursts that interact directly with the ism",
    ", the size scale of the afterglows suggests that the medium has a roughly constant density , although the ism is known to have considerable density inhomogeneity on a range of scales .",
    "the range of interstellar densities in a galaxy like our own goes from @xmath20 @xmath12 in the hot ism to @xmath21 @xmath12 in compact cores in molecular clouds .",
    "the high densities are found in a very small volume fraction so that a typical event is unlikely to occur in such a region .",
    "the situation may change in a starburst region , where a significant fraction of the gas may have a density @xmath22 @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the radio - bright , compact supernova remnants in starburst regions may be interacting with this dense interstellar component @xcite .",
    "the finding that grb 010222 may have occurred within a very active starburst @xcite indicates that the interstellar environments of grbs may have unusual properties .",
    "although the interstellar and wind models are the two main types of environments considered for afterglows , there is a different scenario involving a massive star , motivated by the observation of possible fe lines in the x - ray spectra of afterglows @xcite .",
    "the observations appear to require a substantial mass of fe at @xmath23 cm , so one suggestion is that a supernova occurs before a grb and that the ejecta have time to expand to this radius @xcite .",
    "this requires that the grb be delayed by months .",
    "the supernova would expand into the progenitor wind , creating a complex circumburst region in the inner part of the wind .",
    "we start with the simplest model of grb afterglows involving synchrotron emission from a spherical relativistic blast wave propagating into a constant - density interstellar medium .",
    "the model was worked out in some detail by mszros & rees @xcite in advance of the afterglow detection .",
    "it has since been elaborated upon by others ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in particular @xcite . here",
    ", we will follow the formalism of sari et al .",
    "@xcite , which has been widely used to interpret the spectra and light curves of grb afterglows .",
    "this standard model serves as a benchmark against which other models will be compared .",
    "the standard model assumes that the synchrotron - emitting electrons are accelerated at the shock front to a power - law distribution of lorentz factor @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 ) above some minimum cutoff @xmath26 , which is determined by the shock velocity .",
    "this distribution is further modified by synchrotron cooling in the downstream flow .",
    "denote by @xmath27 the lorentz factor of an electron which cools in a blast wave expansion time . in the `` fast cooling '' case with @xmath28 ,",
    "the electron distribution is given by @xmath29 between @xmath27 and @xmath26 and @xmath30 above @xmath26 .",
    "this electron distribution produces a synchrotron spectrum of the flux @xmath31 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the characteristic frequencies of the photons produced by electrons with @xmath27 and @xmath26 respectively , @xmath34 above @xmath33 , and @xmath35 below @xmath32 .",
    "the spectrum is modified by synchrotron self - absorption , which typically occurs at relatively low frequencies .",
    "assuming that the self - absorption frequency @xmath36 is less than the cooling frequency @xmath32 and that the absorbing electrons that have cooled for different lengths of time are well mixed spatially @xcite , we have @xmath37 below @xmath36 . in the opposite , `` slow cooling '' case with @xmath38 , the electron distribution steepens to @xmath39 above @xmath27 .",
    "assuming that the self - absorption frequency @xmath36 is less than the characteristic frequency @xmath33 , we have the following spectrum : @xmath37 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 for @xmath42 , @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "these broken power - law expressions are often used to interpret the instantaneous spectra of grb afterglows .",
    "they tend to agree with the more accurately determined spectra to within a factor of a few ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to obtain light curves , one must first determine the time evolution of the characteristic frequencies ( @xmath36 , @xmath33 and @xmath32 ) and the peak flux @xmath47 .",
    "the evolution depends on the dynamics of the blast wave . for the spherical blast wave propagating into a constant - density medium envisioned in the standard model ,",
    "the dynamics are described by the self - similar solutions of blandford & mckee @xcite : the blast wave lorentz factor @xmath48 varies with the distance @xmath49 from the explosion center as @xmath50 in the adiabatic regime and @xmath51 in the fully radiative regime .",
    "the lorentz factor and distance are related to the detector - time @xmath52 as @xmath53 . making the standard assumption that a constant fraction @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) of the blast wave energy goes into the electrons ( magnetic fields ) and making use of the jump conditions for relativistic shocks , one obtains the following scalings : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for the slow cooling case , which is always in the adiabatic regime . in the fast cooling case ,",
    "if the electron energy fraction @xmath54 is close to unity , then the blast wave is fully radiative , and the scalings become : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath64 , the evolution remains adiabatic , and the scalings are the same as in the slow cooling case , except for the self - absorption frequency which now decreases with time as @xmath65 .",
    "these scalings are combined with the instantaneous spectra listed above to obtain light curves .",
    "the light curve at a given observing frequency @xmath66 can be described by a broken power - law with breaks at various characteristic times .",
    "these include the times @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 when the characteristic frequencies @xmath36 , @xmath33 and @xmath32 pass , respectively , the observing frequency @xmath66 .",
    "ignoring self - absorption , sari et al .",
    "@xcite obtained two types of light curves in two frequency regimes , separated by a critical frequency @xmath70 at which the characteristic times @xmath68 and @xmath69 become equal , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "the critical time @xmath72 divides the early , fast cooling part of the light curve from the later , slow cooling part . in the high frequency regime where @xmath73 , the ordering of the characteristic times is @xmath74 , which yields a light curve of @xmath75 for @xmath76 , @xmath77 for @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for @xmath80 in the case of adiabatic evolution . in the opposite case of fully radiative evolution , which is possible only before the critical time @xmath72 when the electrons are fast cooling , one has instead @xmath81 for @xmath76 , @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for @xmath85 . in the low frequency regime where @xmath86 ,",

    "weiler , panagia & montes @xcite were able to fit a parameterized model to the radio data , and came to a similar conclusion that the shock is mildly relativistic and is interacting with a clumpy progenitor wind .",

    "chevalier & li @xcite proposed that the steep decay can be explained in a spherical wind model , provided that the electron energy index @xmath250 is close to 3 , a value that is higher than normally found in grb afterglows but is within the range found in radio supernovae @xcite .",
    "radio data provide some support to this interpretation @xcite but do not rule out the jet model , first advocated for this source by sari et al . @xcite",

    "the spherical wind model of chevalier & li @xcite did not take into account of inverse compton scattering , which is important for the parameters they adopted ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "inverse compton scattering lowers the cooling frequency , and poses a problem for the wind model in fitting the x - ray afterglow .",
    "grb 991208 is unique in that the radio data are sampled well enough to allow for a determination of the evolution of the characteristic frequencies @xmath36 and @xmath33 and the peak flux @xmath292 at @xmath33 . the inferred scalings @xmath293 , @xmath294 and @xmath295 @xcite are compatible with the predictions of either the ism - interacting jet model ( @xmath230 , @xmath296 , and @xmath229 ) or the spherical wind model ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath297 ) but not with those of the spherical ism model ( @xmath56 , @xmath298 , and @xmath299 ) .",

    "interestingly , in the jet model of panaitescu & kumar @xcite for this source , where the jet dynamics is followed semi - analytically , the steep decay in optical is mostly attributed to a steepening in the electron energy distribution , as in the wind model for this source , rather than jet effects .",
    "grb 000301c was modeled by li & chevalier @xcite using the same spherical wind model with an electron energy distribution that steepens at a certain ( high ) energy as the one applied to grb 991208 .",

    "the inferred large extinction intrinsic to its bright host galaxy , coupled with the sparseness of the published x - ray @xcite and radio data @xcite , makes it impossible to constrain models firmly .",

    "evidence for supernova has been marshaled by reichart @xcite and galama et al .",
    "@xcite ; the alternative explanation involving dust echoes @xcite appears less likely @xcite , especially if the grb progenitors are wolf - rayet stars instead of red supergiants @xcite .",
    "association with a supernova has also been proposed for other sources , including grbs 980326 @xcite , 991208 @xcite , and possibly 000418 @xcite .",
    "their afterglow observations appear to be compatible with both the jet and wind models . in no source",
    "can the presence of a supernova be excluded definitively @xcite .    the expansion into a wind - type medium and the association with supernova would point to a massive star origin for grbs .",
    "the massive star connection is indirectly supported by the analysis of optically dark bursts by reichart @xcite , which indicates that the majority of grbs may be tied to giant molecular clouds , the sites of massive star formation .",
    "the connection may be strengthened by the presence of possible fe line emission in the x - ray afterglows of grbs 970508 @xcite , 970828 @xcite 991216 @xcite , and 000214 @xcite , which implies a substantial amount of circumburst material .",
    "we have discussed grb 970508 as a wind interactor .",
    "grbs 970828 and 000214 , are optically dark , which is compatible with the idea that they are tied to giant molecular clouds and thus ( indirectly ) to massive stars",
    ". their afterglow data are insufficient to constrain ambient interaction models .",
    "however , some models for the fe lines require a large fe mass and densities @xmath324 @xmath12 at @xmath325 cm @xcite , much larger than the densities inferred in afterglow models and than expected in the wind from a massive progenitor star . the distribution of the dense gas is asymmetric and it is not present along the line of sight to the grb , which is the region probed by the afterglow emission . the strong angular variation of the density is surprising ; in the supranova model @xcite , the supernova would be expected to affect the density along the line of sight . the required fe mass would be greatly reduced if the lines come from a much denser region closer to the explosion center , as in the collapsar - bubble model of mszros & rees @xcite .",
    "the absence of supernova emission in the afterglows of grbs 990123 and 990510 is consistent with their being ism - interactors with compact star merger progenitors .",
    "it therefore appears that there are two types of burst progenitors , with grbs 970508 and 980425 representing the best examples of one type , and grbs 990123 and 990510 the other ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the possible presence of supernova emission in the optical afterglows of grbs 970228 , 980326 , 991208 , and 000418 , coupled with the fact that their afterglows can be fitted by the wind model , plausibly put them in the massive star category .",
    "this assignment is weakened , however , by the fact that the afterglows of these sources can be fitted by the ism - interacting jet model as well . for the other grbs with relatively well observed afterglows , the progenitor types are even less certain .",
    "the interpretation of grb afterglows in terms of ambient interaction models is complicated by several major uncertainties . for the jet model ,",
    "the angular distribution of matter and energy inside the jet is not clear and the hydrodynamics of the jet - ambient medium interaction remains uncertain .",
    "numerical simulations are beginning to address these issues @xcite .",
    "an open issue common to both the jet and wind models is the shape of the energy distribution of the radiative electrons .",
    "fitting the afterglow data of several grbs requires a curvature in the energy distribution .",
    "how the required curvature comes about is not understood .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for the cases that demand a flat distribution with @xmath267 . in such cases ,",
    "the afterglow emission depends sensitively on the way in which the energy distribution steepens at high energies , and the steepening has not been treated self - consistently .",
    "another open issue is how the postshock energy is distributed among electrons , protons , and magnetic field .",
    "in addition , the spherical wind model faces an interesting dilemma : the wind model implies a massive star progenitor , and a collimated flow is expected if it must escape from the center of a star . to some extent",
    ", the spherical model can be justified by the slow apparent evolution of a jet in a wind @xcite .",
    "it may also be possible that , upon passing through the star , the jet becomes uncollimated due to a sudden weakening of the lateral confinement .",
    "we conclude that there is evidence for two types of grb afterglows in different environments : a constant - density interstellar medium and a wind of possibly wolf - rayet star origin .",
    "the types are not immediately distinguishable partly because , at an age of a few days , the preshock wind density is comparable to an interstellar density . at an age of seconds to minutes ,",
    "the preshock density is much higher for the wind case , which could make the types more distinguishable .",
    "pair production in the ambient medium could substantially modify the afterglow emission .",
    "its effects are expected to be far greater in the wind case than in the ism case @xcite .",
    "in addition , the large difference in density for the two cases at small distances from the center of explosion affects the dynamics of blast wave energization , and thus the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "while some theoretical work has been done on the prompt and early afterglow emission , much more is needed .",
    "hopefully , rapid follow - up observations of grb afterglows , to be enabled by hete-2 and swift , would put tighter constraints on the ambient interaction models and the nature of grb progenitors .",

    "<S> we review interaction models for grb afterglows , with an eye on constraining the nature of their progenitors and the geometry of explosion . </S>",
    "<S> evidence is presented for two types of progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> the radio afterglow of grb 980425/sn 1998bw and the multi - frequency observations of grb 970508 can be fitted by a blast wave expanding into a wind - type medium , pointing to a massive star progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> the broadband afterglow data of grbs 990123 and 990510 are better modeled by a jet expanding into a constant - density medium , implying a compact star merger origin . among other </S>",
    "<S> well observed grbs , the jet model appears to be more widely applicable than the wind model , although some cases are ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> the model fits often require a deviation of the energy distribution of the radiating electrons from the commonly assumed single power - law form , particularly for sources with a rapid decline and/or pronounced steepening in the optical light curves . </S>",
    "<S> transition to non - relativistic evolution has been suggested as an alternative explanation for the light curve steepening , although to produce steepening on the order of days or less would require very high ambient densities , which are generally difficult to reconcile with radio observations . </S>",
    "<S> major open issues include the hydrodynamics of jet - ambient medium interaction , a self - consistent determination of the electron energy distribution , and the effects of pair production on the early afterglows which are expected to be particularly large for the wind interaction model . </S>"
