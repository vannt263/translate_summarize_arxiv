    "approaches to image / video compression usually have high computational complexity in encoding but they remain simple in the decoding process part .",
    "also , distributed video coding ( dvc ) [ 1 ] is a low complexity technique which refers to a special video coding paradigm that encodes frames of video sequence independently ( the encoder can be very simple ) and decodes them jointly at the expense of a more complex decoder ( due to exploitation of the temporal redundancies by the decoder side ) . in both conventional video coding and dvc , data collection and compression tasks",
    "are performed disjointedly , with a high cost mechanism that wastes most valuable acquired data , because of limitation of allocated power and available memory . due to great efforts by cands _",
    "et al_. [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and donoho [ 4 ] , compressive sensing ( also called compressed sensing or compressive sampling ) suggests a new framework for simultaneous sampling and compression of signals at a rate significantly below the nyquist rate .",
    "it also permits that under certain conditions , the original signal can be reconstructed properly from a small set of measurements via solving a convex optimization problem or iterative greedy recovery algorithms .",
    "recently , the idea of compressive sensing ( cs ) for imaging ( single pixel camera [ 5 , 6 ] ) has been extended to the conventional predictive / distributed video coding , to develop highly desirable compressive video sensing ( cvs)/distributed compressive video sensing ( dcvs ) .",
    "cvs employs both data acquiring ( video sensing ) and compression into a unified task which emerges a new procedure to directly acquiring compressed video data via random projection for each individual frame , in a low - complexity encoder .",
    "several cvs recovery methods have already been proposed , i.e. , wakin _",
    "et al_. [ 7 ] proposed an intuitive ( motion jpeg motivated ) approach which extends compressive image sensing to video applications by considering each frame of the video sequence independently , and recovers each frame using the 2d discrete cosine transform ( 2d dct ) or a 2d discrete wavelet transform ( 2d dwt ) , individually",
    ". however , this simple extension fails to address the temporal redundancy in video ; nevertheless compressed image sensing techniques explore the spatial redundancy within an image . to enhance the signal sparsity in both spatial and temporal domains and achieve higher sampling efficiency ,",
    "several frames can be jointly considered as a signal and recovered under a 3d transform ( e.g. , 3d dwt ) [ 7 , 8 ] .",
    "results show that a 3d video reconstruction ( joint frames ) using a 3d dwt is better than the 2d frame - by - frame reconstruction using a 2d dwt , but it incurs high computation cost and large memory requirement .",
    "park and wakin [ 9 ] proposed a multi - scale recovery approach , which several cs measurements are taken independently for each frame , and also the motion estimation is applied at the decoding step . the recovered video at coarse scales ( low spatial resolution )",
    "is used to estimate motion which is then used to enhance the recovery at finer scales ( high spatial resolutions ) .",
    "however , its coarse - to - fine reconstruction computational cost is high .",
    "the same approach based on using two - steps to iteratively update the estimates for the images in the video and the inter frame motion , was proposed in [ 10 ] .",
    "also , cossalter _",
    "et al_. [ 11 ] considered the motion estimation in their proposed joint compressive video coding and analysis scheme .",
    "stankovi _ et al_. [ 12 ] and prades - nobet _ et al_. [ 13 ] proposed a block - based selective video sampling scheme where firstly divides frames of the video sequence into reference frames ( or key frames ) and non - reference frames ( or non - key frames ) ; then each frame is divided into the small non - overlapping blocks of equal size .",
    "the reference frames are sampled fully using conventional video compression techniques like mpeg / h.264 ( intra encoding ) . in",
    "[ 12 ] , the reference frames are used to predict sparsity of the successive non - reference frames and cs is applied only within the blocks that are predicted as sparse ones , whereas the remaining blocks are sampled fully . in [ 13 ] , non - key frames are projected and recovered using cs techniques , with an adaptive redundant dictionary built by picking a set of local ( spatially neighboring ) blocks which are extracted from its co - located blocks in the previous decoded key frame , to form its basis without training .",
    "a similar approach was proposed in [ 14 ] .",
    "nevertheless , such local dictionary - based basis may not work very well for blocks with large motion or when the entire scene undergoes motion translation .",
    "in addition such schemes highly rely on the qualities of the neighboring reconstructed key frames and the performance may be degraded due to poorly reconstructed neighboring key frames [ 15 ] .",
    "the work in [ 16 ] relies on small inter - frame differences together with a spatial 2d dwt to produce a sparse representation of the underlying video .",
    "similarly , zheng and jakobs [ 17 ] proposed a video compressive sensing method that relies on the sparsity properties of video in the spatial domain , where key ( reference ) frames are fully sampled and measurements are applied to the difference between each pair of successive frames .",
    "the video signal is reconstructed by first reconstructing the frame differences using @xmath1 minimization algorithm , and then adding them sequentially to the reference frame .",
    "however , they do not sufficiently remove the vast amount of temporal redundancy , e.g. , when exist a large inter - frame difference and fast motion between adjacent frames .    a multi - hypothesis ( mh ) prediction approach for cvs",
    "was proposed in [ 18 ] , where mh predictions of the current frame are generated from one or more previously reconstructed reference frames , and then combined to yield a composite prediction superior to any of the constituent single - hypothesis predictions .",
    "another dictionary based approach is presented in [ 19 ] , where the dictionary is learned from a set of blocks globally extracted from the previous reconstructed neighboring frames together with the side information generated from them .",
    "this work has been extended to assign dynamic measurement rate allocation ( for different local regions ) by incorporating a feedback channel [ 15 ] .",
    "et al_. [ 20 ] proposed a redundant dictionary generation scheme for compressed video sensing , which follows the sparse representation approach of [ 13]-[14 ] .",
    "the authors extended their work to present a maximum - likelihood dictionary learning based reconstruction algorithm for dcvs [ 21 ] . up to our best knowledge ,",
    "there also exist other literatures about cs - based video coding , e.g. , [ 22]-[23 ] .",
    "in this paper we propose a novel for sampling and recovering of compressed sensed video data .",
    "the proposed method divides the video sequence into the key and non - key frames follow by dividing each frame into the small blocks of equal sizes , similar to [ 13 ] .",
    "each blocks of key ( non - key ) frames are sampled using the same sensing matrix @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the compressed key frame data are reconstructed initially using mh block compressed sensing recovery [ 18 ] , in order to use as the initial image in the dictionary leaning algorithm step , to obtain an adaptively learned sparsifying ( als ) basis to exploit the spatial redundancy of frame , by an iterative procedure .",
    "also , we investigate the effectiveness of three well - known dictionary learning methods , to adopt in our scheme . the obtained als basis is incorporated into the optimization problem , for the whole cs frame recovery , in form of @xmath4 quasi - norm . in this step , a split bregman iteration ( sbi ) [ 24]-[25 ]",
    "based technique is employed to solve the non - convex @xmath4 minimization , efficiently . for the recovery of non - key frames ,",
    "first we initialize a prediction of current frame , @xmath5 , by means of previous reconstructed frame @xmath6 , in order to exploit the temporal redundancy .",
    "the prediction @xmath5 is employed into a sbi based method together with the achieved als basis of current frame and current cs data , to recover the current non - key frame @xmath7 by solving the proper minimization problem .",
    "the experimental results show the high competitive performance of our proposed method compared with the other state - of - the - art cvs techniques .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce an abstract framework for cs theory and sbi method . also , we review three well - known techniques of dictionary learning , briefly . the proposed method is described in section iii . numerical results and comparisons for our proposed method are given in section iv and finally , section v concludes the paper .",
    "this section reviews an abstract framework of cs theory and sbi algorithm , accompanied by investigation of three well - known dictionary learning methods , briefly .",
    "suppose we wish to recover a real value finite length signal @xmath8 from a finite length observation @xmath9 ; so that @xmath10 and there is a linear projection between them @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a sensing matrix and @xmath13 denotes the additive noise . since the number of unknowns is much more than the observations , clearly we are not able to recover every @xmath14 from @xmath15 and it is generally considered as an _ ill - posed _ problem . however , if @xmath14 be sufficiently sparse in the sense that @xmath14 can be written as a superposition of a small number of vectors taken from a known ( sparsifying ) transform domain basis @xmath16 or frame @xmath17 @xmath18 or even adaptive learned sparsifying basis ( e.g. , see [ 26 ] ) , then exact recovery of @xmath14 is possible .",
    "so sparsity plays a key role in recovering of @xmath14 from observation vector @xmath15 .",
    "also , @xmath19 would be called @xmath20-sparse if only its @xmath20 coefficients in the set of transform domain ( @xmath21 ) are nonzero and the other @xmath22 coefficients are zero . in other words , the transform domain signal @xmath23 can be well approximated using only @xmath24 nonzero entries . in order to solve the reconstruction problem with a reasonable accuracy and robustness to the noise , the estimation of @xmath14 is formulated as an unconstrained lagrangian optimization problem which incorporates the prior information about the original signal @xmath25 or @xmath26 where @xmath27 . here , the first term is a penalty that represents the closeness of the solution to the observed scene and quantifies the `` prediction error '' with respect to the measurements .",
    "the second term is a regularization term that represents a priori sparse information of the original scene and also it is designed to penalize an estimate that would not exhibit the expected properties .",
    "also , @xmath28 is a regularization parameter that balances the contribution of both terms . in the second term of ( 2 ) or ( 3 )",
    ", @xmath29 is usually considered as @xmath4 or @xmath1 .",
    "this minimizing problem can be solved easily by iterative shrinkage / thresholding ( ist ) methods ( see , e.g. , [ 27 ] ) , bregman iterative algorithms ( see , e.g. ,  [ 24 ] and [ 25 ] ) . since @xmath4 minimization is non - convex and its solution is considered as _ np - hard _ , the common method is to replace @xmath4 quasi - norm with the @xmath1 norm , because it is the closest convex norm to non - convex @xmath4 quasi - norm and minimizing the @xmath1 norm instead . however , a fact that is often neglected is , for some practical problems , i.e. , image inverse problems , the conditions guaranteeing the equivalence of @xmath4 minimization and @xmath1 minimization are not necessarily satisfied .",
    "the split bregman iteration ( sbi ) method was recently proposed by goldstein and osher [ 24 ] for effectively solving @xmath1-regularized optimization problem with multiple @xmath1-regularized terms [ 25 ] .",
    "the basic idea of sbi is to convert the unconstrained minimization problem into a constrained one by introducing the variable splitting technique and then invoke the bregman iteration [ 28 ] to solve the constrained minimization problem .",
    "the rationale behind sbi is that it may be easier to solve the constrained problem than to solve its unconstrained counterpart .",
    "another advantage of the sbi is that it has relatively small memory footprint and is easy to program by users .",
    "such properties are very attractive for large - scale problems .",
    "consider an unconstrained optimization problem@xmath30where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "apparently , ( 4 ) can be converted into an equivalent constrained form and then solved by invoking the sbi .",
    "the sbi framework is presented in table i.     +   + [ table_example ]    [ cols= \" < \" , ]",
    "the motivation of this paper is to propose a novel framework for cvs . in our proposed method , we employed the als basis and @xmath0 minimization for recovering of key frames , while non - key frames are recovered by firstly initialing a prediction of current non - key frame using previous reconstructed frame ( in order to exploit the temporal redundancy ) , and then adopting the prediction into a proper optimization problem . also , we investigated the effectiveness of three well - known dictionary learning algorithms ( in order to learning an als basis ) , and we found out that mdu provides a better recovery performance ( in quality ) compared to the k - svd and mod , but at the cost of higher computational complexity .",
    "we found it reasonable to use the k - svd as the dictionary learning algorithm in our proposed scheme .",
    "the numerical results show the adequacy of our proposed method in cvs , compared to the mentioned methods .",
    "consider the following minimization of the quadratic function : @xmath34 that can be solved by setting its gradient to be zero : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 in order to avoid using matrix inverse , the gradient descent method is utilized , i.e. , @xmath39 by incorporating ( 39 ) into ( 38 ) , and setting its partial derivative with respect to @xmath40 to be zero , the optimal step size , @xmath40 , is yielded , i.e. , ( for simplicity , the subscript @xmath41 in @xmath40 and @xmath42 is omitted without confusion ) @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46",
    "the objective function in ( 33 ) is given by @xmath47 let us add to it the following term @xmath48 where the parameter @xmath49 is chosen in such a way that the function @xmath50 is strictly convex ( with respect to @xmath51 ) , implying that its hessian should be positive - definite , @xmath52 .",
    "this is satisfied by the choice @xmath53 ( the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath54 ) .",
    "the rationale behind this manipulation is to convert the objective function to a new one , for which we are able to get a closed - form expression for its global minimizer .",
    "the new objective function in ( 40 ) is called a surrogate function @xmath55 the above function can be simplified as follow @xmath56@xmath57@xmath58 and by doing more simplification , it yields @xmath59 where @xmath60 . +",
    "as can be seen , the term @xmath61 drops in the new function that makes the minimization much simpler . also , the term @xmath62 in ( 41 ) implying all the terms that are dependent on @xmath63 and @xmath64 alone .    by simplifying and reorganizing ( 41 ) ,",
    "the surrogate objective function can be written as @xmath65 the minimizer of the above function can be obtained by an iterative - shrinkage procedure , producing sequence of results @xmath66 ( the subscript @xmath67 denotes the @xmath67th entry in @xmath68 , and the subscript @xmath69 implies the iteration number ) , where at the @xmath70__th _ _ iteration , @xmath71 ( and of course @xmath15 ) is minimized with the assignment @xmath72 as follow @xmath73 where@xmath74 @xmath75 and the generalized shrinkage operator defines as follow@xmath76",
