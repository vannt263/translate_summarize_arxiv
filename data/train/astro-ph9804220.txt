    "polar - ring galaxies are generally considered to be dynamically peculiar systems in which the outer rings composed of gas and stars are aligned roughly in a perpendicular orientation with respect to the major axis of the central host galaxies ( schweizer , whitmore , & rubin 1983 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1990 ; sackett 1991 ) .",
    "a growing number of observational studies have been recently accumulated which can provide valuable information about the origin of these peculiar polar - ring galaxies .",
    "nearly all of the central host are morphologically normal s0 galaxies , some of which are confirmed to be rapidly rotating by kinematical studies ( schechter & gunn 1978 ; schechter , ulrich , & boksenberg 1984 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1990 ; whitmore 1991 ) .",
    "approximately only 0.5 percent of all s0 galaxies have observable polar - rings , which suggests that a particular mechanism is required for the formation of polar - rings in s0 galaxies .",
    "the ring component also shows rapid rotation comparable to that of the main host galaxies , implying that two dynamically different system coexist in these polar - ring galaxies .",
    "an appreciable amount of hi gas , which is sometimes comparable to the total mass of the host , is closely associated with the stellar ring component ( e.g. , shane 1980 ; schechter et al .",
    "1984 ; richter , sackett , & sparke 1994 ; arnaboldi et al .",
    "1997 ; galletta , sage , & sparke 1997 ) .",
    "the morphology of the polar - rings is basically divided into two broad classes ( whitmore 1991 ) : a narrow ring which is not extended in size ( e.g. , eso 415-g 26 ) and an annulus which is a disk - like component with the central part cut out ( e.g. , ngc 4650a ) .",
    "peculiar morphology is observed in some polar - ring galaxies ( e.g. , the helix galaxy , ngc 2685 , and double ringed system , eso 474-g 26 ) , which further implies considerably complicated physical processes in polar - ring formation and simultaneously provides a clue to the understanding of the origin of polar - ring galaxies ( sackett 1991 ) .",
    "roughly two - thirds of these polar - rings show obvious galactic warps whose shapes look like ` integral sign ' and/or ` banana'(whitmore 1991 ) .",
    "statistical studies on the distribution of the angle between the ring component and the central host reveal that these two components strongly prefer to be orthogonal with each other . these peculiarities both in the kinematics and morphology observed in polar - ring galaxies",
    "have attracted a number of theoretical interests , which are divided basically into two categories : one is the origin of the polar - rings and the other is the nature of dark matter halo surrounding polar - ring galaxies .",
    "although there are a large number of important studies addressing the three dimensional shapes of dark matter halo in the galaxies ( e.g. , whitmore , mcelroy , & schweizer 1987 ; reshetnikov & combes 1994 ; sackett et al .",
    "1994 ; combes & arnaboldi 1996 ) , we here restrict ourselves to the mechanisms which would naturally explain the formation of the polar - ring galaxies with spherical haloes .",
    "it is generally believed that the formation of the polar - rings is the results of a ` secondary event ' involving a pre - existing s0 galaxy ( e.g. , steiman - cameron & durisen 1982 ; sparke 1986 ; quinn 1991 ; rix & katz 1991 ; reshetnikov & sotnikova 1997 ) .",
    "specifically , the host s0 galaxy is supposed to have acquire the material constituting the ring component by capturing the gas during tidal interaction with neighbor galaxies .",
    "the subsequent gravitational interaction combined with the gaseous dissipation then spreads the captured gas and forms the polar - rings around the host galaxy .",
    "one of the promising models along this orthodox scenario is the ` preferred plane model ' in which the differential precession of the rings and the gaseous dissipation cooperate to play a vital role in leading the acquired gas to settle into the stable polar orbit and finally to form the polar - rings ( tohline & osterbrock 1982 ; durisen et al .",
    "1983 ; schweizer et al 1983 ) .",
    "a number of numerical simulations have already confirmed in what physical conditions the polar - rings are more likely to form and continue to exist for a relatively longer time - scale ( habe & ikeuchi 1988 ; christodoulou et al .",
    "1992 ; katz & rix 1992 ) .",
    "indeed these previously proposed models have provided a potential success in reproducing the polar - rings in s0 galaxies , however , these seem to be incapable of giving sufficiently conclusive and persuasive answers to the following seven questions on the origin of the polar - ring galaxies ( sackett 1991 ; whitmore 1991 ; arnaboldi et al .",
    "1997 ; galletta et al .",
    "1997 ) : ( 1 ) why are nearly all the central host galaxies morphologically classified as s0 ? ( 2 ) why are polar - ring galaxies so rare among s0 galaxies ? ( 3 ) why do some polar - ring galaxies have a narrow ring and some have annuli ? ( 4 ) why are the mass and angular momentum of the ring component comparable or sometimes larger than those of the host ? ( 5 ) why are the rings so ` polar ' ? ( 6 ) why some polar - rings have considerably peculiar morphology such as helical and double - ringed shapes ? ( 7 ) why is there an appreciably greater amount of interstellar gas in the polar - ring component ?",
    "in particular , ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 7 ) could not be explained simply by the previous theoretical models , implying either that more elaborated and sophisticated models along the above orthodox scenario should be considered or that the alternative model should be proposed for the explanation of the above questions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the origan of polar - ring galaxies and to propound a new mechanism which more naturally and reasonably explains the aforementioned observational trends of polar - ring galaxies . in the present study",
    ", we consider that the dissipative galaxy merging between two disks is a promising mechanism that quite reasonably answers the above seven questions .",
    "therefore we investigate how the dissipative galaxy merging transforms two disks into one early - type s0 galaxy with polar - ring .",
    "furthermore , we investigate how the orbit configuration of galaxy merging and initial mass ratio of the two progenitor disk galaxies can affect the morphology of polar - rings developed after galaxy merging . in this paper ,",
    "the galaxy merging with specific orbit configurations and sufficient amount of gaseous dissipation is demonstrated to play a vital role in forming both the cental s0-like host and the surrounding polar - ring component in polar - ring galaxies .",
    "this paper is an extended version of bekki ( 1997 ) in which the basic mechanism of polar - ring s0 galaxy formation in galaxy mergers is briefly summarized .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    " 2 describes numerical models for dissipative galaxy merging .",
    " 3 gives the results obtained in the present study . in ",
    "4 , we mainly discuss whether or not the model proposed in the present paper can become a new promising model which naturally and reasonably explains the observational properties of polar - ring s0 galaxies .",
    "we construct models of galaxy mergers between gas - rich late - type disk galaxies by using fall - efstathiou model ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) . in the present merge model , a galaxy intruding from the polar axis of the other galaxy in a merger is referred to as the ` intruder ' whereas the other is referred to as the ` victim ' . in the present model , the dynamical and kinematical properties of the victim are set to be exactly the same as those of the standard model described below whereas those of the intruder with a given mass ( @xmath0 ) and size ( @xmath1 ) are determined by rescaling those of the standard model .",
    "both the density profile of the disk and the rotational curve profile are assumed to be self - similar between the two galaxies and these two galaxies satisfy the freeman s luminosity - size relation ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "for example , if we set the intruder mass to be 2.0 , the size of the intruder is automatically set to be 1.41 .    in the standard model ( corresponding to the victim model ) , the total mass ( @xmath2 ) and the size ( @xmath3 ) of a progenitor disk are set to be 1.0 and 1.0 , respectively . from now on , all the mass and length are measured in units of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , unless specified .",
    "velocity and time are measured in units of @xmath4 = @xmath5 and @xmath6 = @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant and assumed to be 1.0 in the present study . if we adopt @xmath2 = 1.0 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath3 = 10.0 kpc as a fiducial value then @xmath4 = 6.53 @xmath9 @xmath12 km / s and @xmath6 = 1.49 @xmath9 @xmath13 yr , respectively .",
    "these fiducial values are appreciably smaller than those adopted in bekki ( 1997 ) , principally because we here intend to discuss the formation of polar - rings in less luminous galaxies prevalent among polar - ring galaxies . in the present model ,",
    "the rotation curve becomes nearly flat at 0.35 @xmath3 with the maximum rotational velocity 2.22 in our units , corresponding to total halo mass within @xmath3 equal to 3.58 in our units .",
    "the radial ( @xmath14 ) and vertical ( @xmath15 ) density profile of a disk are assumed to be proportional to @xmath16 with scale length @xmath17 = 0.2 and to @xmath18 with scale length @xmath19 = 0.04 in our units , respectively .",
    "the velocity dispersion of dark halo particles at a given point is set to be isotropic and given by the virial theorem .",
    "in addition to a rotational velocity set by the gravitational field of disk and halo components , the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersions are assigned to disk components according to the epicyclic theory with toomre s parameter , @xmath20 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , equal to 1.0 . the vertical velocity dispersion at given radius are set to be 0.5 times as large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point .",
    "the collisional and dissipative nature of the interstellar medium are modeled by the sticky particle method ( schwarz 1981 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized here that this discrete cloud model can at best represent the @xmath21 interstellar medium of galaxies in a schematic way . as is modeled by mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) ,",
    "the interstellar medium can be considered to be composed mainly of ` hot ' , ` warm ' , and ` cool ' gas , each of which mutually interacts hydrodynamically in a rather complicated way .",
    "actually , these considerably complicated nature of interstellar medium in disk galaxies would not be so simply modeled by the ` sticky particle ' method in which gaseous dissipation is modeled by ad hoc cloud - cloud collision : any existing numerical method probably could not model the @xmath21 interstellar medium in an admittedly proper way . in the present study , as a compromise , we only try to address some important aspects of hydrodynamical interaction between interstellar medium in disk galaxies and in dissipative mergers .",
    "more elaborated numerical modeling for real interstellar medium would be necessary for our further understanding of dynamical evolution in dissipative galaxy mergers .",
    "the size of the clouds relative to the disk size is set to be 7.5 @xmath22 in our units in the present simulations .",
    "the corresponding size and mass of each cloud in the present study , are 75pc and @xmath23 @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the radial and tangential restitution coefficient for cloud - cloud collisions are set to be 1.0 and 0.0 , respectively . in all the simulations , the initial gas mass fraction represented by @xmath25",
    "is set to be 0.0 for the intruder and 0.2 for the victim unless specified .",
    "the reason for this initial condition is principally that we do not believe that interaction between two gas disks is essential for polar - ring formation in the present model , and it introduce a great deal of complexity .",
    "the adopted value of 0.2 is typical one for gas - rich spiral galaxies ( e.g. , roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "total particle numbers used in the standard model ( for the victim galaxy ) are 10000 for halo component , 10000 for stellar disk one , and 20000 for gas one . for the intruder , the total particle numbers depend on the @xmath0 in such a way that the numbers are linearly proportional to the @xmath0 .",
    "for example , total particle numbers are 20000 for halo component and 20000 for stellar disk one , in the model with @xmath0 = 2.0 .",
    "we incorporate physical processes of star formation into the present model in a more idealized manner .",
    "we consider only the conversion of gaseous component to stellar one and do not include here other important effects of star formation such as effects of thermal and dynamical heating by type ii supernova on the dynamics in this preliminary stage . in the present study",
    ", we will use the term ` star formation ' to refer to the process of gas consumption .",
    "a new stellar particle ( collisionless particle , referred to as ` new stars ' or as ` new stellar component ' ) is created at the position of original gas particle according to the algorism described below .",
    "we adopt the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ) with exponent @xmath26 = 2.0 as the controlling parameter of the rate of star formation . the amount of gas consumed by star formation for each gas particle in each time step , @xmath27 , is given as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the gas density around each gas particle and the mean gas density at 0.48 radius of an initial disk , respectively .",
    "the coefficient of the schmidt law is set to be the same for the whole region of galaxies in the present study .",
    "as is described this , the ` star formation ' in this preliminary study only means the formation of collisionless particles and does not literally mean the actual and realistic series of star formation such as successive fragmentation of gas clumps and the resultant formation of very dense molecule core .",
    "this modeling for star formation is rather simplified so that we can only address some important aspects of the roles of star formation in the formation of polar - ring galaxies .",
    "however , we believe that since the main point of the present study is only the qualitative behavior of the star formation in the formation of polar - rings , even the rather simple model adopted in this study makes it possible to grasp some essential ingredients of the roles of ` real ' star formation . more extensive studies on this subject will be done in our future papers by using more elaborated model for star formation .      in all the simulations , the orbit of the two disks",
    "is set to be initially in the @xmath31 plane and the distance between the center of mass of the two disks is set to be initially 4.0 in our units .",
    "the initial spin axis of the victim is set to be in a @xmath32 plane and specified by a parameter @xmath33 which describes the angle between the @xmath34 axis and the spin angular momentum vector of the victim disk .",
    "the initial spin of the intruder is set to be exactly parallel to @xmath34 axis for all models .",
    "two different types of orbit are adopted in the present study .",
    "one is that the two disks are set to move initially on a @xmath35 axis with absolute magnitude of relative velocity @xmath36 ( `` polar - axis collision '' ) .",
    "this type of initial orbit configuration with nearly zero orbital angular momentum is frequently adopted in the studies of the formation of collisional galactic rings ( e.g. , hernquist & weil 1993 ; appleton & struck - marcell 1996 ; gerber , lamb , & balsara 1996 ) .",
    "the other is that the two disks are set to merge with parabolic encounter and with a given the pericenter distance , @xmath37 ( `` parabolic collision '' ) .",
    "this type of initial orbit configuration with an appreciable amount of orbital angular momentum in a bound system is adopted in the studies of elliptical galaxy formation in galaxy mergers ( e.g. , barnes 1992 ) .",
    "the main reason for our adopting these two types of rather simple orbit configuration is that we intend to elucidate more clearly the formation mechanism of polar - ring galaxies .",
    "formation of polar - ring galaxies in a more complicated and less idealized situation of galaxy merging will be investigated in our future papers .",
    "in what follows , we investigate how a polar - ring galaxy is developed during galaxy merging between two disks and clarify the formation mechanism of the polar - rings .",
    "furthermore , we vary the initial mass ratio of two progenitor galaxies ( @xmath0 ) and thereby investigate how the initial mass ratio controls the final morphology of the developed polar - ring galaxies in dissipative galaxy mergers .",
    "all the simulations have been carried out on the grape board ( sugimoto et al . 1990 ) at astronomical institute of tohoku university .",
    "the gravitational softening parameter is fixed at 0.03 in all the simulations .",
    "considering the particle number of the present study ( less than 100000 ) and the time - scale of the numerical calculation ( an order of ten dynamical time ) , the two body relaxation due to the finite particle number ( and due to the adoption of the softening length ) has negligible dynamical effects on the relatively global dynamics investigated in the present merger model .",
    "the time integration of the equation of motion is performed by using 2-order leap - frog method . @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the second column of table 1",
    "specify the type of orbit configuration of galaxy merging : @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the polar - axis collision and parabolic one , respectively .",
    "the values of model parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath25 , @xmath33 , @xmath40 , and @xmath37 are summarized in table 1 for 17 models ( model 1 @xmath41 17 ) .",
    "characteristic of polar - ring morphology developed after galaxy merging are described in the ninth column of table 1 for each model .",
    "for example , the ` double ring ' means that the developed polar - ring morphology @xmath42 @xmath43 double - ring .",
    "in this section , we first observe how a s0 galaxy with polar - rings is formed in a dissipative merger with particular orbit configuration (  3.1 ) .",
    "next we describe how the initial mass ratio of two progenitor disk galaxies ( @xmath0 ) controls the final morphology of the developed polar - rings (  3.2 ) .",
    "first , we present the results of model 1 which shows a typical behavior of polar - ring formation in the present study .",
    "s0 galaxies with narrow polar - rings are found to be more likely to form in this model with the initial mass ratio of two progenitor disks , @xmath0 , equal to 2.0 , as is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the time evolution of merger orbit projected onto @xmath35-axis for model 1 is given in figure 2 .",
    "time evolution of gas mass for this model is given in figure 3 .",
    "in this model the intruder galaxy is found to be inevitably transformed into the central s0-like component whereas the victim is found to be dramatically transformed into a narrow polar - ring , as is described below .",
    "figure 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 describe the morphological evolution of each component in each of two galaxies . as is shown in these figures ,",
    "as the intruder pierces the victim and shoots through it , the initially thin stellar disk of the intruder become thicker and thicker owing to strong dynamical heating during the violent gravitational interaction between these two galaxies ( the time , @xmath44 , equal to 2.0 in our units ) .",
    "while the intruder is then pulled gravitationally back to pierce again the victim ( @xmath44=4.0 ) , the stellar disk of the intruder suffers from violent relaxation to form more disky s0-like spheroid ( @xmath44=8.0 ) .",
    "the density profile of the intruder at @xmath44 = 14.0 shows clear deviation from initial exponential profile looking more like the so - called @xmath45 law , and furthermore its kinematics within the central host shows an appreciable amount of global rotation ( see figure 8 . ) .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that the formation of s0-like hosts in polar - ring galaxies is closely associated with the violent dynamical interaction of the two merging galaxies and furthermore that the formation of s0-like host ( which is the intruder in the present model ) is inevitable in the formation of polar - ring galaxies owing to the stronger gravitational interaction of galaxy merging .    as is shown in figure 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 , the victim disk , on the other hand",
    ", is finally transformed into a narrow polar - ring surrounding the central spheroid mainly composed of the stellar disk of the intruder .",
    "as the intruder pushes the central part of the victim out and simultaneously excites the outwardly propagating density wave in the victim , the stellar component of the victim is dynamically relaxed to form the diffuse spheroidal component in the merger remnant because of violent relaxation of galaxy merging .",
    "the gaseous component of the victim forms the compressed gas layer with higher density owing to the enhanced cloud - cloud collisions and the resultant gaseous dissipation .",
    "subsequent star formation and further gaseous dissipation at the compressed gas layer dramatically transforms the victim disk into a narrow polar - ring composed of gas and new stars .",
    "morphology of the gaseous polar - ring projected onto the @xmath32 plane looks more like ` integral - sign ' galactic warp at @xmath44 = 10.0 and ` banana ' one at @xmath44 = 12.0 , implying that warps frequently observed in polar - ring galaxies are closely associated with the gas and stellar dynamics of the merging victim galaxy .",
    "the victim at @xmath44 = 14.0 shows mass distribution clearly deviating from exponential profile and does not have any remarkable global rotation along the major axis of the central host ( see figure 8 . ) . as is shown in figure 9 , the mass distribution of new stars formed after @xmath44 = 8.0 seems to be more disky whereas that of new stars formed before @xmath44 = 8.0 seems to be more extended and spherical .",
    "this result reflects the fact that an appreciable amount of new stars are produced in the shocked and ring - like gas layer during the galaxy merging .",
    "this new stellar component formed in the relatively later phase of galaxy merging can be observed as the stellar polar - ring in polar - ring galaxies .",
    "these results quite naturally explain why some polar - ring galaxies have an appreciable amount of interstellar gas in the polar - rings : this is simply because the polar - ring component is originally a gas - rich galactic disk .",
    "what we should stress furthermore is that in this figure 9 , a discernable amount of interstellar gas and new stars is fueled to the central part of the merger remnant .",
    "this result is consistent with the observational evidences that some polar - ring galaxies actually show the pronounced activity ( e.g. , post star - bursts and liner activity ) in their central part ( e.g. , schechter et al .",
    "1984 ; reshetnikov & combes 1994 ) .",
    "this result also implies that such polar - ring galaxies as showing the central activity are examples of polar - ring s0s formed by merger events .    as is described above , the successive radially propagating wave excited by the intruder is found to play an important role in the earlier stage of polar - ring formation .",
    "moreover , the gaseous dissipation and the subsequent star formation in the compressed gaseous region in the wave are found to damp the radial oscillation of the @xmath46 and then to change the @xmath46 into the stational polar - ring @xmath47 in the later stage of polar - ring formation .",
    "such damping of the radial oscillation owing to gaseous dissipation in galaxy merging is described by figure 10 in which the same analysis as that of athanassoula , puerari , bosma ( 1997 ) is adopted .",
    "this two - fold polar - ring formation is a unique physical process of dissipative galaxy mergers with specific orbital configurations , thus provide an alternative explanation for the polar - ring formation .",
    "the developed polar - ring component is found to show discernable precession even after a merger remnant reaches the nearly dynamical equilibrium state , reflecting the fact that the formation of the polar - ring is a result of the past violent gravitational interaction between two disk galaxies .",
    "this precession is one of characteristics of polar - rings developed in the present merger model for polar - ring formation , as is described in detail later .",
    "thus a central s0-like host galaxy with a narrow polar ring is formed by dissipative galaxy merging with specific orbital configurations within only @xmath48 12 @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath48 1.8 @xmath9 @xmath49 yr .",
    "these results demonstrate that strong dynamical effect on the central part of the victim disk is indispensable for the formation of polar - rings in this picture , which is quite different from the previously proposed models , such as the preferred plane models .",
    "moreover the time - scale of polar - ring formation in the present merger model , which is typically @xmath48 10 dynamical time of the system , is relatively short compared to that in the preferred plane one .",
    "the present merger model for polar - ring formation accordingly seems to be a new and promising candidate theory , which can give reasonable and plausible explanations for a number of fundamental observational properties of polar - ring galaxies .",
    "however it is safe for us to say that it is not certain whether or not the present merger model is an @xmath50 mechanism for polar - ring formation : there are a number of observational indications that in a certain interacting galaxy , the polar - ring @xmath51 to be about to form according to the preferred plane scenario ( e.g. reshtnikov , hagen - thorn , & yakovlera 1996 ) .",
    "observability of polar - ring s0s formed by dissipative galaxy merging is discussed in details in the  4 .",
    "we here describe under what physical conditions s0 galaxies with polar - rings are more likely to form in dissipative galaxy merging .",
    "we here observe the results of four comparative experiments of models , model 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , which are designed to elucidate more clearly the essential parameters for the formation of polar - rings .",
    "figure 11 gives a collection of the final morphology of the three models ( model 3 , 4 , and 5 ) .",
    "we find that neither the model with less inclined victim disk ( @xmath52 = 30.0 , model 3 ) nor the model with an appreciably larger amount of initial orbital angular momentum ( model 4 ) show any remarkable polar - ring component .",
    "this result suggests that both the more inclined victim disk and a relatively smaller amount of orbital angular momentum are required for the formation of polar - rings in the present merger model ( see figure 11 . ) .",
    "this result of model 3 explains why the polar - rings are so polar ( e.g. , whitmore 1991 ) : this is because if the two progenitor disks are not so highly orthogonal with each other , the merger remnant just becomes a morphologically normal s0 galaxy .",
    "the result of model 4 , the orbit configuration of which has been investigated more extensively by several authors in the context of e / s0 galaxy formation , naturally explains why the polar - ring e / s0 galaxies are so rare among e / s0 galaxies : this is because a specific kind of orbit configuration of galaxy merging is required for the formation of polar - ring e / s0 galaxies .",
    "we also find that the model with no gas particle ( i.e , without gaseous dissipation ) , model 5 , does not show any ring - like component surrounding the central spheroid developed after galaxy merging ( see figure 11 . ) .",
    "this result suggests the following important role of gaseous dissipation in the polar - ring formation : gaseous dissipation can remove random kinetic energy of the gaseous component in the victim disk , which is caused by violent gravitational interaction between two disks , and accordingly it enables some of the gas component to settle again in well - ordered disky configuration .",
    "this result of model 5 naturally explains why polar - ring galaxies are less massive or luminous on average : this is principally because less luminous late - type spirals generally have an appreciably larger amount of interstellar gas ( e.g. , roberts & haynes 1994 ) , which is indispensable for polar - ring formation .",
    "these comparative experiments clearly demonstrate that both a minimum amount of gaseous dissipation and a specific kind of orbit configuration are required for the formation of polar - rings , which naturally explains why the polar - ring galaxies are so rare among s0 galaxies . in this model with @xmath0 = 2.0 , the polar - ring morphology depends weakly on the relative velocity of two merger precursor disk : as the relative velocity becomes larger ( e.g , in the model with @xmath40 = 1.5 , model 6 ) , the polar - ring component looks more like a disturbed dynamical system .      in this subsection",
    ", we mainly describe how the initial mass ratio of two progenitor galaxies affects the final morphology of the central s0-like spheroid and the surrounding ring component developed after galaxy merging .",
    "figures 12 and 13 summarize the final mass distribution for models with @xmath0 = 1.5 , 1.0 , 0.7 , 0.5 , 0.3 and 0.1 ( corresponding to model 7 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 16 , and 17 , respectively ) in which orbit configuration of galaxy merging is exactly the same as that of model 1 but the initial mass ratio of progenitor disks ( @xmath0 ) is different from that of model 1 .",
    "these figures clearly indicate the @xmath0 dependence of the final morphology of polar - ring galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging , as is described later . in the following , for each model with different @xmath0 , the dependence of structure and kinematics of the developed polar - ring galaxies on the relative velocity of two merger precursor galaxies",
    "are given only if the results of this dependence are considered to be remarkably important .",
    "like model 1 , the model with @xmath0 = 1.5 ( model 7 ) shows both the central disky s0 host and the surrounding thin and narrow polar - ring component ( see figure 12 . ) .",
    "the essential physical processes of polar - ring formation are nearly the same as those in model 1 .",
    "the central s0 in this model looks more puffed out compared with that of model 1 , probably because the intruder suffers from the stronger dynamical interaction with the victim disk .",
    "the axis of intrinsic angular momentum of the developed s0 galaxy is more appreciably inclined compared with initial intrinsic spin axis of the intruder .",
    "these results suggests that both morphology of the central s0 host and the inclination angle between polar - rings and the central host in a polar - ring s0 galaxy can reflect the initial mass ratio ( @xmath0 ) of two merger precursor disks , which furthermore suggests that the strength of dynamical interaction in galaxy merging is an important factor for structure and kinematics of merger remnants . in the present study ,",
    "s0 galaxies with a narrow polar - ring ( such as eso 415 - g 26 ) are found to be reproduced more successfully in the models with @xmath0 larger than 1.5 .      for the model with @xmath0 = 1.0 ( corresponding to the so - called ` major merger ' , model 8) , both the intruder disk and the victim one suffer from the stronger violent dynamical relaxation of galaxy merging , principally because the total mass of the intruder is exactly the same as that of the victim .",
    "consequently , the central spheroidal galaxy developed after galaxy merging looks more like an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the polar - ring component , on the other hand , looks more strongly disturbed than those of model 1 and 7 probably because of the stronger dynamical relaxation of galaxy merging . for this model ( and the models with 0.5 @xmath53 @xmath0 @xmath53 1.0 ) ,",
    "the dynamical interaction between the developed central spheroid and the polar - ring component is very significant so that the polar - ring shows discernable precession around the central host after galaxy merging . considering the relatively smaller probability of major merging , polar - ring galaxies developed in major galaxy mergers like this model 8 could be considerably rare , which can give a natural explanation for the extremely rare existence of elliptical galaxies with polar - rings ( such as am 2020 - 5050 ) .",
    "essential physical processes of polar - ring s0 formation in the model with @xmath0 = 0.7 ( model 9 ) are basically the same as those of model 1 , as is described in bekki ( 1997 ) . in this model ,",
    "the transient morphology of the ongoing merger at the time when the intruder pierces the victim disk is strikingly similar to the morphology of the two disks in ngc 660 ( e.g. , van driel et al .",
    "this result suggests that galaxies like ngc 660 are characteristic and probably rare examples of polar - ring galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging . even for this model , both density profile of the intruder and that of the victim ultimately show clear deviation from their initial exponential profile looking more like @xmath45 law , and furthermore kinematical property of the central host shows appreciable amount of global rotation .",
    "what is remarkable in this model is that the ring morphology in the merger remnant depends more strongly on the relative velocity of the two galaxies .",
    "it is found that the larger the initial relative velocity is , the more peculiar the morphology of the developed polar - ring is ( model 10 and 11 ) : for models with the relative velocity is larger than 1.5 but less than the escape velocity of the system , some merger models show double - rings or other peculiar structure especially in the gaseous component of the merger remnant .",
    "furthermore , as has already been described in bekki ( 1997 ) , polar - rings do not form but rather transient ` cartwheel'-like rings form in the victim disk if the relative velocity of the two merger precursor exceeds the escape velocity of the system ( model 12 ) . in this model ( model 12 ) , the intruder galaxy completely having escaped from the gravitational trap of the victim is transformed into s0-like galaxy after the galaxy interaction .",
    "these results imply that only the initial relative velocity of merger precursors is the difference in the formation process between the apparently different two types of galactic rings ( that is , polar - rings and collisional ` cartwheel'-like rings ) .",
    "it is found that if the @xmath0 is approximately equal to 0.5 , the stellar disk of the victim galaxy is not so completely destroyed by the intruder galaxy during galaxy merging primarily because the intruder does not dynamically disturb the victim disk strongly enough to cause violent dynamical relaxation .",
    "this incomplete destruction of the victim disk results in peculiar morphological evolution of polar - rings surrounding the central early - type galaxy in a galaxy merger .",
    "for the model with @xmath0 = 0.5 ( model 13 ) , the gaseous ( and new stellar ) component in the merger remnant show precession even after the completion of galaxy merging , principally because the gaseous component and the stellar one in the merger remnant mutually interact with each other even after galaxy merging .",
    "consequently , the long - term dynamical evolution of gaseous component in this model is remarkably different from that of other models with @xmath0 = 2.0 and 1.5 ( model 1 and 7 ) . as is shown in figure 14 , the gaseous polar - ring developed after galaxy merging finally @xmath42 @xmath43 a double - ringed system owing to mutual dynamical interaction with the stellar component of the merger remnant ( at @xmath44 = 26.0 ) .",
    "we also find that this peculiar double - ringed morphology can be observed in the models with different initial collisional parameters of galaxy mergers ( model 14 and 15 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the formation of s0 galaxies with morphologically peculiar polar - rings such as helical rings ( e.g. , ngc 2685 ) and double rings ( e.g. , eso 474-g 26 ) is closely associated with the later dynamical interaction between the stellar merger remnant and the developed polar - rings .",
    "these results furthermore imply that the mass ratio of merger precursor galaxies required for the formation of double - ringed early - type galaxies should be approximately 0.5 .",
    "future numerical studies with high resolution and with more sophisticated gas dynamics and star formation would enable us to reproduce more successfully the s0 galaxies with peculiar polar - rings which are strikingly similar to ngc 2685 and eso 474-g 26 both in kinematics and mass distribution .      we find that if the @xmath0 is approximately less than 0.3 , the victim galaxy is not substantially disrupted by the intruder and only suffers from dynamical thickening of the disk , whereas the intruder is completely destroyed by the strong disturbance .",
    "figure 15 , 16 , 17 and 18 describe how a central host galaxy with polar - rings which @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath43 annular rings is formed during dissipative galaxy merging in the model with @xmath0 = 0.3 ( model 16 ) . as is shown in these figures , the intruder galaxy with smaller mass",
    "is completely destroyed during violent relaxation of galaxy merging to form a less centrally concentrated spheroid in the merger remnant . as a result of this",
    ", the intruder does not dynamically damage the victim strongly enough to trigger the violent relaxation of the victim stellar disk .",
    "accordingly , the stellar disk in the victim is not destroyed completely to keep the disk configuration even after galaxy merging . in the gaseous disk of the victim , outwardly propagating gaseous waves , which are excited by the intruder galaxy during galaxy merging , are transformed into the annular gaseous rings at @xmath44 = 6.0 and finally to non - axisymmetric structure at @xmath44 = 12.0 . in total , more than fifty percent of initial gas mass is converted to new stars within 14.0 @xmath6 and most of the new stars are located in the victim disk even after galaxy merging in this model . the warp of gaseous disk shows variously different morphology at different time , which suggests that morphological types of warps observed in polar - rings can reflect the time dependent gas dynamics in the polar - rings ( or victim disk ) . as is shown in figure 19 , the radial mass distribution of the intruder shows clear deviations from initial exponential profiles owing to the stronger dynamical relaxation in the galaxy merging .",
    "the developed disk with morphologically peculiar gaseous component might be actually observed as annular polar - rings in the nearly edge - on view of the galaxy .",
    "thus a smaller spheroidal galaxy with a larger and morphologically peculiar gaseous disk and a stellar disk are found to be formed , which @xmath42 @xmath43 the edge - on view of a s0 galaxy with @xmath56 annular polar - rings such as ngc 4650a . in particular , the face - on view of the victim disk in figure 17 at @xmath44 = 4.0 could be similar to that of annular polar - ring galaxies . the annular - ring feature in figure 17 at @xmath44 = 4.0 furthermore reminds us of the hoag s objects ( schweizer et al .",
    "1987 ) , which suggests a close physical connection between annular polar - ring galaxies and the hoag s objects .",
    "appleton & struck - marcell ( 1996 ) describe the details of the possible mechanism for the formation of the hoag s objects in terms of epicyclic interference patterns resulting from multiple encounters .",
    "it is not clear , at least in the present study , whether the hoag s objects are actually face - on views of annular polar - ring s0s or forming collisional rings such as a ` cartwheel ' ring .",
    "furthermore there are no extensive studies investigating whether or not such epicyclic interference patterns as are described in appleton & struck - marcell ( 1996 ) can provide a mechanism for the formation of annular polar - rings .",
    "it should be accordingly addressed in our future papers whether the mechanism for the formation of hoag s objects is essentially the same as that for the polar - ring s0 formation .",
    "anyway the results derived in the model with @xmath0 = 0.3 provide a clue to the understanding of the origin of the appreciably larger amount of mass and angular momentum in polar - rings observed in ngc 4650a : the larger ` polar - ring ' component in ngc 4650a was once a more massive gas - rich disk galaxy which had finally transformed into ` polar - rings ' because of the past galaxy merging with a less massive galaxy .",
    "the results of this model 1 and those of model 16 imply that both narrow polar - rings and annular ones , which are considered to be the two basic morphological types of polar - ring galaxies , are originally disk galaxies before they manifest themselves as polar - rings and that the dichotomy between the narrow rings and annular ones can be understood in terms of the difference in the initial mass ratio of two merger progenitor disks in galaxy merging .",
    "what we should stress here is that we have only succeeded in reproducing a central galaxy whose edge - on view is apparently similar to the s0 galaxy with annular polar - rings .",
    "actually the central galaxy developed in the model with @xmath0 = 0.3 does not show so large global rotation as is observed in annular polar - ring galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 4650a ) , as is shown in figure 19 .",
    "furthermore it is clear from the mass distribution of the merger remnant ( figure 19 ) that the central part of the merger remnant is not completely cut out .",
    "that is , we appear to have failed to reproduce an annular polar - ring galaxy with the central part of the ring component completely cut out and with the central host showing a relatively larger amount of global rotation .",
    "this apparent failure implies either that the galactic model adopted in the present study , including the star formation law , gas physics , and the assumption of freeman s law ( that is , self - similar disks ) , are not so appropriate or that s0 galaxies with annular polar - rings can not be formed by galaxy merging . considering the relatively smaller parameter space investigated in the present study and the present rather idealized gas dynamics and star formation of dissipative galaxy mergers , it is safe for us to say that it is not clear , at least in this preliminary stage of the present study , whether our future elaborated numerical models can simulate the formation of a s0 galaxy with annular polar - rings .",
    "the problems concerning the formation of annular polar - rings and the promising ways to remove these are discussed in detail in the section of discussion (  4 ) .",
    "it is found that if the initial mass ratio is less than 0.1 , neither the central spindly s0-like host nor the disk component with peculiar morphology are formed .",
    "the main reason for this is that the intruder galaxy is completely destroyed during merging to form a considerably diffuse spheroid , which would not be identified with a spindly s0 galaxy , and thus can not give the stronger dynamical impact to the victim disk .",
    "this result suggests that in addition to the particular orbit configuration of galaxy merging and gaseous dissipation , a certain range of mass ratio of merger precursor galaxies ( basically @xmath0 @xmath57 0.3 ) is required for the formation of polar - ring galaxies .",
    "as is described above , a spiral galaxy intruding from the polar axis of the victim galaxy excites the outwardly propagating density wave in the gaseous component of the victim . the subsequent gaseous dissipation and star formation",
    "dramatically transform the victim into polar - rings . the intruder galaxy , on the other hand ,",
    "is inevitably transformed into a rapidly rotating and spindly s0 galaxy owing to the violent gravitational interaction of galaxy merging .",
    "one of the advantages in the present merger model of polar - ring s0 formation is that depending on the @xmath0 ( and @xmath40 ) , variously different morphology of polar - rings in polar - ring galaxies can be reproduced : as the @xmath0 becomes smaller , the polar - ring(s ) can change from a narrow ring to peculiar double rings , and to transient annular rings .",
    "this result reflects the fact that the structure and kinematics of merger remnants depend strongly on the strength of the dynamical interaction of galaxy merging ( or the degree of violent relaxation ) , which is basically determined by the mass ratio of merger precursor disks .",
    "the present explanation for the origin of variously different polar - ring morphology in polar - ring s0 galaxies is difficult to be observationally confirmed , however , the present scenario for the formation of polar - ring galaxies seems to provide a clue to the thorough understanding of the formation and evolution of polar - ring galaxies .",
    "the best way to assess the validity of the present merger model of polar - ring s0 formation is to observe the polar - ring galaxies just forming in galaxy mergers . considering the relatively short time - scale of polar - ring formation in the present model ( within a several dynamical times of the merger system , corresponding to less than @xmath49 yr , depending on the initial mass of the system ) , the observable number of such forming polar - ring galaxies is likely to be small .",
    "there are a few examples , however , especially in the atlas of peculiar galaxies ( arp 1966 ) and the catalog of polar - ring galaxies ( whitmore et al .",
    "1990 ) , which provide us with valuable information on the formation process of polar - ring galaxies .",
    "ngc 660 is one of the most promising candidates , in which the central host is surprisingly classified by a late - type galaxy ( sb or sc ) and the ring component has an appreciably larger amount of hi gas .",
    "this polar - ring galaxy is possibly an ongoing galaxy merger between two late - type spirals with exponential disks and the central spiral host galaxy would be transformed into early - type galaxy within @xmath58 yr because of continuing violent relaxation in the galaxy merging process .",
    "furthermore this galaxy actually does not show noticeable tidal tails , a fact of which is consistent with the present result that the ongoing mergers required for the formation of polar - ring galaxies do not develop tidal tails .",
    "an another example is the eso 199 - ig 12 ( schweizer et al . 1983 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1990 ) in which the center of the polar - ring component seems @xmath59 to coincide with the center of the central host s0 galaxy and a number of tidal debris can be observed in the edge of the s0 .",
    "this galaxy strongly suggests that the polar - ring component is still developing in an ongoing galaxy merger .",
    "ngc 5544 ( and 5545 ) and ngc 6240 could be also promising candidates of forming polar - ring galaxies in galaxy mergers .",
    "all of these possible polar - ring galaxies in formation contain valuable information about the formation and evolution histories of the galaxies .",
    "accordingly more extensive observational studies which address in more detail the kinematical and structural properties of these systems are very desirable .",
    "the following three are important diagnostics for polar - ring s0 galaxies in formation .",
    "the first is the relative radial velocity of the two interacting galaxies ( if any and if possible ) , which is a key factor determining whether the interacting galaxy becomes a cartwheel - like ring galaxy ( if the relative velocity is larger than the escape speed of the system ) or a polar - ring one ( if not ) , as is indicated by bekki ( 1997 ) .",
    "the second is to confirm wether or not there are diffusely dispersed stellar components ( e.g. , long - lived stars ) in ongoing mergers .",
    "the present merger model predicts that in the formation of polar - rings , a greater amount of the victim stellar components is dynamically pushed out by the intruder in a galaxy merger .",
    "the third is to check wether the central host in a possibly forming polar - ring galaxy is oblate spheroid or prolate one . in the present merger model ,",
    "the central host is a still oblate disk galaxy when the polar - ring is developing in a ongoing merger .",
    "it is doubtlessly worthwhile to investigate observationally a number of physical properties of possible forming polar - ring galaxies along the above three diagnostics .",
    "what we should furthermore stress is that if polar - ring s0 galaxies are formed in such a way that the present merger model predicts , the suitable site for observing polar - ring s0s in formation is higher redshift universe .",
    "this is primarily because the smaller relative velocity required for polar - ring formation in galaxy mergers is more likely in higher redshift universe ( where multiple galaxy encounters can happen more frequently and these encounters can contribute to the formation of galaxy mergers with such lower relative velocity ) rather than in the lower redshift universe ( where a dynamical system including possible galaxy mergers is fully virialized and thus has a larger velocity dispersion in the member galaxies ) .",
    "if galaxy mergers with smaller relative velocity are actually prevalent in higher redshift ( thus , if most of polar - ring s0s are formed at higher redshift ) , polar - ring components observed in the present epoch are ` older ' .",
    "although more extensive observational studies including not only dynamical and kinematical properties of polar - rings but also chemical and photometric evolution of polar - ring galaxies are indispensable for clarifying the formation epoch , a growing number of recent observational results seem to support the ` older ' polar - rings .",
    "eskridge & pogge ( 1997 ) reveal that abundance of h ii regions in polar - ring galaxy ngc 2685 amounts to 0.8 @xmath48 1.1 solar abundance , which means that chemical evolution in the polar - ring proceeds for a longer time - scale ( corresponding to the chemical evolution time - scale of typical galactic disks ) .",
    "brocca , bettoni , & galletta find ( 1997 ) that there is no remarkable environmental difference between polar - ring s0s and normal galaxies , which suggests that if polar - rings are formed in interacting / merging galaxies , the preferred epoch of interaction / merging is not present but past .",
    "reshetnikov ( 1997 ) reveals that the detection rate of possible polar - ring galaxies in the sample of hubble deep field ( hdf ) is extremely higher ( 0.7 percent among the hdf galaxies ) than that of local universe ( 0.05 percent ) , which implies that polar - ring galaxies are more likely to form in higher redshift .",
    "these observational studies does not necessarily mean that the preferred epoch of polar - ring galaxy formation is higher redshift universe , however , these study seem to suggest that polar - rings in formation can be more easily observed in higher redshift universe .",
    "galaxy mergers are generally considered to transform two disk galaxies into one e / s0 galaxy with variously different morphology and kinematics ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "for example , barnes ( 1992 ) demonstrates that elliptical galaxies with the radial density profile of the so - called @xmath45 law and smaller specific angular momentum are reproduced reasonably well in disk - disk mergers owing to the efficient transfer of mass and angular momentum during the merging .",
    "bekki & shioya ( 1997a ) suggest that both boxy and disky elliptical galaxies are formed by star - forming and dissipative galaxy mergers , depending on the star formation history of merger precursors .",
    "multiple merging , which could be occurred in the group of galaxies , are also demonstrated to produce normal elliptical galaxies ( barnes 1989 ; weil & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , barred early - type galaxies can be reproduced in galaxy mergers with prograde orbit configuration ( mihos , walker , & hernquist 1995 , bekki & shioya 1997b ) as well as in interacting galaxies ( noguchi 1987 ) . in the present study , polar - ring galaxies rather than the above ` normal ' e / s0 galaxies are produced , implying a close physical relationship between polar - ring galaxies and the above ` normal ' e / s0 galaxies .",
    "considering the physical conditions required for polar - rings in the present study , it seems to be reasonable to claim that the physical conditions governing the difference in structure and kinematics between these two apparently different types of galaxies ( polar - ring s0s and normal e / s0 galaxies ) are initial orbit configuration of galaxy merging and mass - ratio of two interacting / merging galaxies : if two gas - rich disk galaxies with unequal mass merge with each other with relative inclination of the two galaxies highly perpendicular with each other and with the relative collisional velocity relatively smaller ( less than escape velocity of the system ) , the merger remnant becomes a polar - ring galaxy , otherwise they become a ` normal ' e / s0 galaxy . thus , the present study strongly suggests that ` normal ' e / s0 galaxies and polar - ring galaxies are ` relatives ' in the sense that they are all merger remnants with different initial conditions of galaxy merging .",
    "although it appears that the present merger model has succeeded in reproducing both the central s0-like host and polar - ring component in polar - ring galaxies , there still remains a number of issues we should address in order to confirm how plausible and viable the merger model actually is . among these",
    ", we must first investigate how long polar - rings developed via dissipative merger events can remain dynamically stable and look more like ` polar - rings ' after the merger remnant reaches the virial equilibrium .",
    "longevity and stability of polar - rings have been demonstrated to depend on the characteristics of gaseous cooling and the degree of gaseous self - gravitation in the ring component as well as on the three dimensional shapes of dark matter halo ( e.g. , christodoulou et al .",
    "1992 ; katz & rix 1992 ) .",
    "in the present merger model , especially for the model with mass ratio of two disks approximately equal to 0.5 ( @xmath0 = 0.5 ) , the developed polar - rings are observed to show precession even after the completion of galaxy merging owing to the dynamical interaction between the central host galaxy and the ring component . in this model ,",
    "most of the materials in the victim disk is dynamically dispersed owing to stronger tidal interaction between two disks , and thus self - gravity of the victim disk is not important .",
    "this result implies that in addition to the gaseous cooling and self - gravity , the dynamical interaction between the central host and polar - rings is one of the key determinant for the stability and longevity of the polar - rings . in the present stage of this preliminary work , however , it has not been demonstrated whether or not the developed polar - rings can survive for more than several tens of dynamical times of the system ( corresponding roughly to several @xmath49 yr ) without being destroyed or absorbed into the central host because of the later dynamical interaction between these two components .",
    "thus , in our future study , we must investigate how the later dynamical interaction between the central host and the polar - ring component can determine the longevity and the long - term stability of the polar - ring component , in order to confirm the validity of the present merger model for polar - ring(s ) formation .",
    "in particular , we intend to examine the dependence of the stability of polar - rings on the initial mass ratio of progenitor two disk galaxies in galaxy mergers .",
    "these studies would help us to predict how frequently we can observe the polar - ring galaxies among s0 galaxies and furthermore give us more quantitative answers to the question as to why only 0.5 percent of the s0 galaxies actually show remarkable polar - rings .",
    "s0 galaxies with annular polar - rings ( e.g. , ngc 4650a ) are considered to show global rotation in the central s0 and have polar - rings with the central part completely cut out ( e.g. , schechter et al .",
    "1984 ; whitmore et al . 1990 ; sackett et al . 1994 ) .",
    "although a s0 galaxy with narrow polar - rings ( e.g. , eso 415 - g 26 ) has been demonstrated to be reproduced relatively successfully by dissipative galaxy merging , we @xmath60 to have failed to reproduce exactly such annular polar - ring galaxies . actually a self - gravitating disk with very peculiar edge - on morphology observed in models with @xmath0 = 0.3 , the transient feature of which can be seen as annular polar - rings , does not have such a central hole as the observed annular polar - rings have .",
    "one interpretation of this apparent failure is that the present merger model can @xmath61 form s0 galaxies with narrow polar - rings ( not with annular rings ) and thus that we should incorporate another important physical processes of galaxy merging for the explanation of annular polar - ring galaxies .",
    "the other possibility is that the apparently ` annular ' rings are not actually annular rings , but parts of galactic disks .",
    "recent observational studies on a typical annular polar - ring galaxy , ngc 4650a , show that the morphology of the polar - ring component is more like @xmath62 @xmath63 rather than annular rings ( e.g. , arnaboldi et al .",
    "this result suggests that the apparently ` annular ' ring component is actually a self - gravitating ` galactic disk ' with spiral arm morphology viewed from a specific angle .",
    "furthermore , extensive observational study on the peculiar polar - ring galaxy ngc 660 shows an exponential light profile in the gas - rich polar - ring component , meaning that the polar - ring component is actually a gas - rich spiral ` galaxy ' without prominent central part ( e.g. , van driel et al 1995 ) .",
    "these observational studies suggest that annular rings observed in polar - ring galaxies are actually not the ` rings ' but normal galactic disks whose central density becomes very small for some unknown reasons .",
    "further observational studies are desirable to confirm whether the central part of annular rings in real polar - ring galaxies are @xmath64 cut out or the apparently annular rings are in fact a galactic disk with peculiar morphology .",
    "the present numerical study provides a new mechanism by which both the central s0-like host and the ring component in a polar - ring galaxy are simultaneously formed .",
    "although uncertainties of the numerical treatment of gas dynamics and star formation still remain , it appears that our model has succeeded in reproducing @xmath65 polar - ring galaxies and explaining naturally a number of important observational properties of them . in the proposed model , the formation of polar - ring galaxies is essentially ascribed to the details of dynamics of dissipative galaxy merging with specific orbital configurations . specifically , the central host of a polar - ring galaxy is the galaxy which has been inevitably transformed from a late - type spiral into an early - type s0 galaxy during the merging .",
    "the ring component , on the other hand , is the ` galaxy ' which has been dramatically transformed from a late - type spiral into a narrow ring or annuli owing to the violent gravitational interaction and gaseous dissipation during the merging .",
    "although both specific orbital configurations and gaseous dissipation in galaxy merging are required for the formation of polar - ring galaxies in the present model , these constraints also give natural explanations to observed trends such as the prevalence of s0 among polar - ring galaxies ( e.g. , whitmore 1990 ) , the rarity of the polar - ring galaxies among s0 galaxies ( e.g. , whitmore et al .",
    "1991 ) , and an appreciably larger amount of interstellar gas in polar - rings ( e.g. , sackett 1991 ) .",
    "moreover it is found that the morphology of polar - rings such as a narrow ring ( e.g. , eso 415 - g 26 ) , annular rings ( e.g. , ngc 4650a ) , helical rings ( e.g. , ngc 2658 ) , and double rings ( e.g. , eso 474 - g 26 ) can reflect both the orbital parameters of galaxy merging and the initial mass ratio of two merger precursor galaxies .",
    "thus , the present study demonstrates that a merger remnant of a gas - rich galaxy merger is one of promising candidates of polar - ring s0 galaxies .",
