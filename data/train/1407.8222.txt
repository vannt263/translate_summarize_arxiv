    "is one such question .",
    "personally , we favor a negative answer . in  @xcite",
    ", gessel asks whether there are ( nonnegative ) rational gf which have a _ combinatorial interpretation _ , but are not @xmath23-rational .",
    "thus , a negative answer to problem  [ op : gesel - comb - int ] would give a positive answer to gessel s question .",
    "must be positive .",
    "] of course , what s a combinatorial interpretation is in the eye of the beholder ; here we are implicitly assuming that our irrational tilings or paths in graphs ( see @xmath3[ss : enumr - cycles ] ) are _ nice _ enough to pass this test ( cf .",
    "we plan to revisit this problem in the future .",
    "there are over 200 different combinatorial interpretation of catalan numbers  @xcite , some of them 1-dimensional such as the _ ballot sequences_. a quick review suggests that none of them can be verified with a bounded memory read only tm . for example , for the ballot 01",
    "sequences one must remember the running differences @xmath830 , which can be large .",
    "this gives some informal support in favor of our conjecture  [ conj : cat ] .",
    "let us make following , highly speculative and priceless claim .",
    "we initially tried to disprove the conjecture .",
    "recall that by lemma  [ l : cat3 ] and the technology in section  [ s : tech - apps ] , it suffices to obtain the constant @xmath832 as the product of values of the hypergeometric functions given in theorem  [ t : hypo ] . while @xmath833 is easy to obtain , our hypergeometric sums seem too specialized to give value  @xmath834 .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the conjecture that @xmath835 is not a _ period _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we should mention here that it is rare when we can say anything at all about the constant  @xmath313 in conjecture  [ conj : growth ] .",
    "the constant in corollary  [ c : hypo - transc-6 ] is an exception : is known to be transcendental by the celebrated 1996 result of nesterenko on algebraic independence of @xmath834 and @xmath836 , see  @xcite .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ l : fin ] uses a generalization of a standard argument in combinatorial linear algebra , for computing the number of rational tilings : @xmath837 where @xmath652 is the weighted adjacency matrix of  @xmath838 .",
    "it is thus not surprising that we use a cycle decomposition argument somewhat similar but more general than that in  @xcite .    in the same vein , the `` well - defined multiplicities ''",
    "argument in the proof of lemma  [ l : welld ] is similar to the `` cycle popping '' argument in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the details are quite different , however .",
