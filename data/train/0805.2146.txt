    "qcd simplifies in the  t hooft limit of a large number of colors , yet differs from the physical case , @xmath3 , by only @xmath4 corrections  @xcite . as a result",
    ", it has been a long - standing goal to understand the properties of qcd at large @xmath0 .",
    "this goal has become even more interesting as string theory developments , based on gauge / gravity duality , attempt to move towards predictions for qcd - like theories at infinite @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "considerable progress towards this goal has been made using numerical lattice computations ( as reviewed , for example , in refs .",
    "for example , using conventional large volume simulations , and extrapolating from @xmath5 , precision results for several quantities in the large-@xmath0 limit have been obtained .",
    "in addition , many quantities have been found to depend only weakly on @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider an alternative to conventional large volume simulations , namely the use of large-@xmath0 volume reduction , in which the infinite space - time volume is collapsed to a single point , with space - time degrees of freedom repackaged into the @xmath6 color degrees of freedom .",
    "this allows one , in principle , to trade two large parameters , the volume and @xmath7 , for a single large parameter , and consequently to consider much large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the idea of large-@xmath0 reduction for lattice gauge theories was first proposed by eguchi and kawai in ref .",
    "they defined the `` reduced '' theory to be a lattice gauge theory on a single site and showed that , under certain assumptions , wilson loops in the reduced theory and in the @xmath8-dimensional infinite - lattice gauge theory acquire the same expectation values in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "the two main assumptions in @xcite are that expectation values of products of single - trace operators factorize at large-@xmath0 ( see below ) and that the vacuum is symmetric under the @xmath9 center transformations applied to the model s @xmath1 `` link '' matrices @xmath10 ( see ) , rather than the @xmath11 , theory in this paper .",
    "the two theories become equivalent as @xmath12 , but the extra phase in the @xmath11 theory , which decouples from the dynamics at any @xmath0 , obscures the underlying mechanisms we discuss in later sections . ] .",
    "it was quickly realized , based on weak coupling arguments and numerical results , that the second assumption does not hold for @xmath13 in the continuum  @xcite , and various ideas for solving this problem were suggested .",
    "the first , which we focus on here , was of quenching the eigenvalues of the link matrices by forcing them to have a @xmath14 invariant distribution .",
    "this means that , by construction , all order parameters for the breakdown of the @xmath9 symmetry , such as @xmath15 , vanish .",
    "this `` quenched eguchi - kawai '' ( qek ) model was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and first numerical results indicated that it did indeed solve the problem of unwanted symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "intensive analytic investigation of the qek model ensued .",
    "( for example , see the papers @xcite , which are relevant for us here . ) for further discussion and references we refer to the reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "studies of the qek model tailed off , partly because of the emergence of the apparently more promising `` twisted eguchi kawai '' ( tek ) model @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss this model here , but note only that despite the early literature , recent extensive simulations find evidence that large-@xmath0 reduction fails in the tek model  @xcite .",
    "another line of development , initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended in a series of papers summarized in @xcite , has been much more successful .",
    "this is the idea of partial reduction .",
    "here one reduces not to a single - site but to a lattice of size @xmath16 , with @xmath17fm .",
    "as long as the dimensions exceed this minimum , the @xmath9 center symmetry is seen to be unbroken , so reduction holds and one obtains volume - independent results if @xmath0 is sufficiently large .",
    "detailed studies have demonstrated partial reduction , and provided results for gauge and fermionic quantities for @xmath18  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we return to the original qek model , and study whether reduction holds there as well , as was indicated by the early works @xcite . we are motivated to do so not just as a tool to study very high values of @xmath0 , but also for the following reason .",
    "it has recently been argued that the @xmath9 breaking does not occur in any volume if the fermions are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , and that in such a theory , complete large-@xmath0 reduction to a single site should hold  @xcite .",
    "this theory is of phenomenological interest because , through the orientifold large-@xmath0 equivalence of adjoint and two - index antisymmetric tensor fermions , it differs from physical qcd by corrections of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "studying this theory numerically at any volume , however , is expensive since it requires simulating dynamical fermions .",
    ", in this theory they enter at @xmath19 and thus dynamical simulations are necessary . ]",
    "thus , before plunging in to such a study , we chose to get experience with single - site models , and the qek model is a natural candidate .",
    "the outline of paper is as follows . in section  [ ek - review ]",
    "we review the features of the original eguchi - kawai ( ek ) model which are relevant for our study , such as the failure of reduction in this model , and its relation to @xmath9 breaking . in section  [ qek - review ]",
    "we discuss the qek model in some detail .",
    "we begin by introducing the quenching prescription , and by presenting the symmetries of the model .",
    "we then review the theoretical arguments for the validity of the large-@xmath0 equivalence between the qek and large-@xmath0 qcd . in section  [ analytics ]",
    "we present weak - coupling analytic considerations that question these arguments and we conclude that , similarly to the ek model , it is likely that reduction fails in the continuum limit . in section  [ numerics ]",
    "we present an extensive numerical lattice study of the qek and find evidence to support our claims of section  [ analytics ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ summary ] with remarks on the implications of our findings for other large-@xmath0 reduced models , such as those in @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the original ek model , so as to set notation and provide background for our observations .",
    "the ek model is a @xmath8-dimensional lattice gauge theory restricted to a single site whose partition function is @xmath20 here @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the t hooft coupling , and the integration measure is the haar measure on @xmath1 . aside from the `` reduced '' gauge symmetry ,",
    "@xmath23 the model is also symmetric under center transformations applied independently to the @xmath8 link matrices @xmath24 and under the @xmath8 reflections @xmath25    a wilson loop on the original lattice that is defined by the path @xmath26 , and that is given by @xmath27 is mapped in the reduced model to @xmath28 the essence of reduction is that the expectation values of @xmath29 in the gauge theory and of @xmath30 in the reduced model are the same at large-@xmath0 : @xmath31 to obtain one derives the dyson - schwinger equations of @xmath29 and @xmath30 and finds that they are the same , up to additional source terms .",
    "these source terms vanish provided that the following two conditions are satisfied @xmath32 here must hold for all contours @xmath33 and @xmath34 , while in @xmath35 denotes any reduced wilson loop whose path is a mapping of an open path in the gauge theory , e.g. @xmath36 this means that , in at least one direction , the corresponding @xmath37 of has the the number of @xmath38 s less the number of @xmath39 s different from zero . , a subtlety that will not play any role in our considerations . ]",
    "the factorization required in is expected to hold in large-@xmath0 theories , and realizes the idea of the `` master field ''  @xcite . condition ( [ condition2 ] ) holds if the vacuum is @xmath9 symmetric , since under this symmetry @xmath35 acquires a phase .",
    "in fact , as already noted in section  [ intro ] , this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the four - dimensional ek model , at weak - coupling .",
    "this is shown by perturbative calculations in the weak - coupling ( @xmath40 ) limit  @xcite , and has been demonstrated by lattice simulations to hold for @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "thus does not hold , invalidating reduction .",
    "it is useful for our subsequent discussion to briefly recall the perturbative calculation of refs .",
    "one first writes the link matrices in polar form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues , @xmath45\\ , ;   \\qquad p^a_\\mu \\in [ 0,2\\pi)\\ , .",

    "breaks down for the degenerate eigenvalues that are picked out by minimizing @xmath64 .",
    "this is due to the presence of zero modes .",
    "one can extend the calculation to include the effects of these modes and the conclusions are unchanged in the weak - coupling limit  @xcite . at moderate values of @xmath65 , however , only numerical calculations are reliable , and these  @xcite are consistent with the weak - coupling picture of @xcite . ]",
    "this implies that , for @xmath1 , the theory has @xmath66 `` vacua '' , with @xmath67 , which are transformed into each other by the center transformations ( [ zn_sym ] ) .",
    "such a clustering of the eigenvalues appears to indicate spontaneous breakdown of the center symmetry and so to invalidate . to establish spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , however , one needs to know whether fluctuations about each vacuum are sufficient to restore the symmetry ( as happens for @xmath68 in infinite volume statistical mechanical systems ) . in other words , does the free - energy barrier between the different vacua become infinitely high as @xmath12 ( implying symmetry breaking ) or not ( implying symmetry restoration ) ? also , the calculation leading to is valid only when @xmath40 , and it is possible that the symmetry is restored for moderate values of @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , as noted above , numerical simulations imply that the symmetry is indeed broken once @xmath65 becomes moderately large .",
    "we conclude this section with a general remark concerning the possible ways that reduction can fail .",
    "of the two key conditions , eqs .",
    "( [ condition1])-([condition2 ] ) , it is often considered to be the second that is crucial .",
    "thus the validity of eguchi - kawai reduction has become almost synonymous with the absence of spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry . in this scenario",
    "there are multiple vacua , connected by symmetry transformations , around each of which the fluctuations are @xmath69 .",
    "we wish to emphasize , however , that this is not the only possibility .",
    "what is required for reduction to hold is the _ combination _ of and , and it is also possible that the first of these can fail .",
    "this happens if there are multiple would - be symmetry - breaking ground states yet fluctuations lead to motion between all these states even when @xmath12 .",
    "( this possibility has been already mentioned in the previous paragraph . ) in an infinite volume theory this corresponds to a breakdown of cluster decomposition .",
    "these two scenarios should be compared to that with a _",
    "single _ vacuum obeying cluster decomposition , in which case both relations hold and reduction is valid .    the distinction between the failure of reduction due to a breakdown of cluster decomposition and due to ssb is important below , so we illustrate it with the following simple example . for an @xmath1 ek theory , as noted above , there is ssb for sufficiently weak coupling , with @xmath70 vacua . if we change the gauge group to @xmath11 , however , the free energy landscape has a `` mexican - hat '' form , and the @xmath66 vacua become part of a continuous degenerate manifold connected by the four @xmath71 phases ( one per direction ) .",
    "the path integral over these phases causes expectation values of open loops to vanish and holds .",
    "this does not , however , mean that reduction holds , because the first of the required conditions , eq .",
    "( [ condition1 ] ) , is not satisfied .",
    "the failure of ( [ condition1 ] ) can be seen by comparing its two sides for the case where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both open loops that , when combined , form a closed loops ( for example see fig .",
    "[ w - loop ] ) .",
    "for this choice the @xmath71 transformations multiply @xmath72 and @xmath73 by opposite phases and so the l.h.s .",
    "of is independent of these @xmath71 phases and has an @xmath19 value .",
    "in contrast , the r.h.s .",
    "is of @xmath74 because the open - loop expectation values do vanish .",
    "the failure of factorization is perhaps surprising , but occurs because the vacuum is not unique and because the @xmath71 degrees of freedom have unconstrained fluctuations .",
    "this is also an example of why it is simpler to analyze the @xmath1 theory .",
    "quenching attempts to avoid the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath9 symmetry by forcing the eigenvalues not to cluster . in this section",
    "we recall the quenching prescription and describe its relation to infinite - volume large-@xmath0 qcd .",
    "the prescription consists of first calculating expectation values for a fixed set of the eigenvalues @xmath53 ( labeled collectively by `` @xmath58 '' and distinguished from the usual expectation values by a subscript ) , @xmath75 here @xmath76 is simply @xmath77 with the @xmath10 having the form ( [ eq : formofumu ] ) , i.e. @xmath78 @xmath79 is the partition function for fixed @xmath58 , @xmath80 and the @xmath57 take values in @xmath1 .",
    "the second part of the prescription is to average expectation values over the choices of @xmath58 : @xmath81 here @xmath82 is a positive weight function ( with integral normalized to unity ) which is invariant under the @xmath9 shifts @xmath83 , and dense in the space of the @xmath47 as @xmath12 . for the @xmath1 theory , it should also incorporate the constraints ( [ eq : sunconstraints ] ) .",

    "( [ gauge_sym])-([refl_sym ] ) are realized .",
    "the gauge transformations can be chosen to act only on the @xmath57 : @xmath87 by contrast , the center and reflection symmetries must , in general , be realized by transforming the eigenvalues : center transformations ( [ zn_sym ] ) become @xmath88 while the reflections ( [ refl_sym ] ) become @xmath89 there are , however , special choices of @xmath82 for which one can realize eqs .",

    "quenching solves the problem of the dynamical clustering of eigenvalues , and leads to the desired vanishing of the expectation values of open wilson loops such as @xmath90 . to see this , note that the center transformation performs a `` clock rotation '' of the @xmath47 and thus multiplies @xmath91 by @xmath92",
    "this is as in the unquenched ek model , but now the @xmath47 are forced to have a @xmath93 symmetric distribution .",

    "the second step , which one might call `` quenched factorization '' , is special to the quenched theory .",
    "if it holds , then , due to the vanishing of quenched expectation values of open loops [ as in ] the extra terms ( [ eq : loop0 ] ) in the loop equations do vanish in the large-@xmath0 limit .",

    "thus , the sum over color indices does not lead to a uniform integration over the brillouin zone , and the agreement with infinite - volume perturbation theory fails .",
    "the presence of permutations in the dynamics has long been known , and was stressed particularly in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . to our knowledge , however , the implications for the validity of reduction have not previously been noted .",
    "permutations are generated by transpositions , in which @xmath163 for one pair @xmath164 and one choice of @xmath56 .",
    "transpositions can be accomplished , for example , by multiplying @xmath57 from the left by the @xmath1 matrices @xmath165 , which are the identity aside from @xmath166 as @xmath167 runs from @xmath168 to @xmath169 , @xmath170 changes to @xmath171 , where @xmath172 differs from @xmath44 in having the @xmath63th and @xmath65th momenta permuted . since it is possible to reach any permutation by a sequence of transpositions , an ergodic simulation will pass through all possible permutations of the input momenta .",
    "the question then is which of these permutations has the smallest free energy",
    ". only if they are equally likely will the quenched model work as desired .",
    "we can calculate the relative free energies in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "first we describe the energy ( i.e. action ) `` landscape '' .",
    "the minimum energy states , after appropriate gauge fixing , have @xmath173 and the momenta in _ any _ permutation of their input values .",
    "this is because the plaquette is unity for any choice of diagonal @xmath174 s .",

    "note that , because the logarithm is a concave function , @xmath62 is minimized by choosing permutations in which there are values of @xmath164 for which @xmath190 is simultaneously small in all directions . in other words , one lowers the free energy by aligning , or `` locking '' , the momenta in different directions .",
    "the gain one makes by locking the small momenta outweighs the loss incurred by locking large momenta .",
    "we note that it is the same free energy @xmath62 that causes the spontaneous breakdown of the center symmetry in the ek model . in that case",

    "the simplest choices are the expectation values of the @xmath192 open loops @xmath193 which are sensitive to correlations between gauge fields in different directions .",

    "for the remainder of this section we discuss in more detail how locking leads to a failure of reduction . in particular ,",
    "we explain why the previous arguments , summarized in section  [ qek_equiv ] , do not hold .      in this section",
    "we first focus on the case of the clock momenta , and then return to other choices . as noted above , the quenched average in this case is just an average over permutations of the momenta .",
    "but we now understand that the non - perturbative qek model automatically includes this sum over permutations ",
    "it is self - averaging .",
    "thus , in principle , the additional quenched average is unnecessary .",
    "we also know , however , that the permutations are included with different relative weights  this is manifest in the weak coupling free - energy landscape of fig .",
    "[ f_vs_m ] , and there is no reason to expect equality for other couplings .",
    "regardless of the details , the mere fact that the weights are different implies that the integrations over momentum space that are induced by the sums over color indices are not uniform .",
    "this is sufficient to invalidate reduction the momentum integrations in the reduced and infinite - volume cases are different .",
    "the case of complete locking provides an extreme example : the momentum of each gluon then has the same component , @xmath190 , in each direction , and the integration over the @xmath8-dimensional brillouin zone collapses to an integration along the 1-dimensional body diagonal .",
    "the argument for reduction based on the loop equations also fails , because one or other of the key steps , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : loop1 ] ) and ( [ eq : loop2 ] ) , does not hold . to see how this works , we write out these relations for the case that @xmath207 and @xmath208",
    ": @xmath209 we now argue that , if locking occurs , then , for some @xmath56 and @xmath210 , the following two statements are correct :    a.   the r.h.s . of is of @xmath4 .",
    "b.   the l.h.s . of is of @xmath19 .",
    "thus one or both of the relations must be wrong .",
    "the numerical evidence of section  [ numerics ] suggests that it is the second relation , , which fails .",
    "it is easy to see that statement ( i ) is correct regardless of the choice of @xmath82 .",
    "this is due to the center symmetry ( [ eq : momentazn ] ) , under which @xmath211 since the measure @xmath212 is unchanged when @xmath213 , the phase factors will cause @xmath214 to vanish . for the clock",
    "momenta the situation can be slightly different . there , self - averaging may take place , and this means that the momenta that contribute to @xmath215 are all those related to @xmath58 by permutations .",
    "these include also the momenta @xmath216 with @xmath217 integer , and so @xmath218 .",
    "consequently we see that self - averaging in the clock momenta case makes statement ( i ) correct even without the integrations .    to see why statement ( ii ) is correct note that the locking means that some of the @xmath195 will have @xmath19 values .",
    "in contrast to the integrands of , the integrand here , @xmath219 , is invariant under the center symmetry , and thus maintains its @xmath19 value even after integration .",
    "which of the two equations  ( [ mloop1 ] ) and  ( [ mloop2 ] ) fails ?",
    "this depends on the nature of the dynamics .",
    "if the self - averaging occurs , then the second step , which for clock momenta is simply @xmath220 is trivially valid , and it is the first step which fails .",
    "this breakdown of large-@xmath0 factorization is then an example of the breakdown of cluster decomposition due the presence of multiple vacua all those related by the center and reflection symmetry .",
    "the other possibility is spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the center symmetry , in which the system gets stuck in the vicinity of one of the locked vacua .",
    "we recall that @xmath79 itself is @xmath9 symmetric with clock momenta , so there is a symmetry to break . furthermore ,",
    "despite the fact that the qek model has zero volume , ssb is possible when @xmath12 because there are then an infinite number of degrees of freedom . the @xmath221 ( or , indeed , the quenched expectation values of any open loops ) are order parameters  non - vanishing values indicate ssb . if ssb takes place then , by definition , self - averaging no longer occurs , and vacuum expectation values of open loops vanish only if we explicitly average over the input permutations .",
    "if the input permutation is changed by a center transformation , then , since the dynamics is @xmath9 invariant , the vacuum that is selected will also be changed by the same transformation . in this possibility , factorization , , holds , because fluctuations about the single vacuum are suppressed as @xmath12 .",
    "it is the second step , , that fails . on the l.h.s .",
    "the same vacua are selected in the two quenched expectation values , because the same input momenta are used , while on the r.h.s .",
    "different vacua are , in general , selected . thus the l.h.s",
    ". will be of @xmath19 for all input @xmath58 , while the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "will average to zero .",
    "thus what we call quenched factorization fails .",
    "we discuss which of the two possibilities  self - averaging or ssb  is expected to occur in the next subsection .",
    "regardless of which occurs , however , the key point is that the combination of the relations ( [ mloop1]-[mloop2 ] ) fails , either invalidating cluster decomposition or breaking the center symmetry , and thus large-@xmath0 reduction fails .",
    "furthermore , one can numerically test for this by calculating the l.h.s . of ( [ mloop1 ] ) and determining whether it falls as @xmath222 ( as required for reduction ) or tends to a constant as @xmath12 ( reduction fails ) .",
    "we now consider the uniform weight function , @xmath223 . in this case",
    "@xmath79 is not center - symmetric and the @xmath198 are not order parameters . nevertheless ,",
    "if locking occurs , we expect something similar to ssb to take place . for a random input choice of @xmath58",
    ", we expect the system to sample the space of permutations , until it finds that with the smallest free energy .",
    "note that none of the permutations will be related by center or reflection symmetries , so all are expected to have different free energies . in this picture",
    ", the system ends up fluctuating in the vicinity of a particular permutation .",
    "if the weak - coupling free energy is any guide , the chosen permutation will be such that if , for a given pair of indices @xmath99 , the difference @xmath190 is small for one value of @xmath56 , then it will also be small for all other values of @xmath56 .",
    "in other words the chosen momenta will be partially locked.s in different directions are different .",
    "] thus , even though the input momenta are uniformly distributed in the bz , those chosen dynamically are not , and planar perturbation theory is not correctly reproduced .",
    "the expected partial locking implies that , for most input @xmath58 , some of the @xmath198 will fluctuate around complex values with magnitudes of @xmath19 .",
    "if so , this invalidates the quenched factorization of , because the l.h.s .",
    "averages to an @xmath19 value , while the @xmath58-integrals on the r.h.s .",
    "implement the center symmetry and cause the averages to vanish .",
    "this picture is confirmed by our numerical findings in section  [ numerics ] .    for @xmath156",
    "the situation is similar to that for @xmath155 .",
    "there are multiple locked vacua related by the center and reflection symmetries , and locking invalidates reduction .",
    "the difference is that it is only the @xmath161 subgroup of the full center symmetry which is realized , where @xmath224 . to make clear how the presence of permutations in the dynamics unravels the carefully chosen coverage of the bz",

    "similarly , all other off - diagonal pairs can be moved by permutations onto the diagonal .",
    "thus if the free - energy favors locking , as the weak - coupling argument implies , then the momenta chosen by the simulation will lie on the one - dimensional diagonal of the bz .",
    "are equal , as they are for @xmath227 , then there are flat directions which are not gaussian , and the form @xmath228 of is invalid . as mentioned above , we do not study further the effect of these flat directions , but rather investigate the qek model with monte - carlo simulations ( see next section ) .",
    "] finally , we briefly discuss the choice @xmath229 of .",
    "this is in some sense intermediate between the clock and uniform choices . on the one hand ,",
    "any value of @xmath58 is possible with @xmath115 , while , on the other , the large-@xmath0 limit of @xmath115 is @xmath137 .",
    "thus we expect locking or partial - locking for @xmath230 , and this is indeed what we find numerically .      in this subsection",
    "we address the question of whether , for the clock momenta , we expect the theory to exhibit ssb or not .",
    "we are interested in this question for fixed @xmath65 and @xmath12 .",
    "the weak - coupling result of provides a guide to the free - energy landscape , and suggests that the dominant states correspond to fluctuations about the locked vacua . as in any statistical mechanical system , the issue is whether the fluctuations are large enough to cause the theory to move from one locked vacuum to others related by symmetry transformations . in infinite volume ,",
    "we know from the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem @xcite that for @xmath13 the fluctuations are not ir divergent and ssb is possible , while for @xmath231 it is not . the question is how this result translates to the qek model where the spatial volume is embedded in the color space .    to get a rough idea of what happens ,",
    "imagine that we are in a completely locked vacuum .",
    "a measure of the fluctuations in the ( normalized ) traces of open wilson loops ( such as the @xmath198 ) is given by the `` tadpole '' graph @xmath232 where @xmath56 is fixed , and we have used .",
    "the @xmath233 comes from expanding the @xmath10 , and the @xmath222 from the normalized trace .",
    "note that since we are doing perturbation theory we can really fix the momenta , and we are taking @xmath58 to be locked .",

    "one - dimensional _ momentum space , and is thus ir divergent .",
    "the cut - off @xmath236 ( with @xmath237 a constant that could be determined by a more complete analysis ) arises from fact that the original sum , , has a minimum @xmath181 of @xmath4 .",
    "the ir divergence implies that @xmath238 \\label{eq : tadpole_div}\\ ] ] so that the fluctuations about the locked vacua diverge as @xmath12 for fixed @xmath65 .",
    "these divergences can be anticipated from the result for the maximum energy barrier @xmath239 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : transp_v])-([eq : parsonsbarrier ] ) ) that exists between two configurations related to each other by the permutation @xmath240 . denoting @xmath241",
    ", we see that if @xmath242 and @xmath243 , then @xmath244 , and fluctuations in the direction parameterized by the @xmath1 matrix ( [ eq : transp_v ] ) overcome the barrier when @xmath0 is large enough that @xmath245 . for locked vacua with @xmath246 in all directions ,",
    "the barrier is even lower , @xmath247 .",
    "the gaussian terms in the action for these `` flat '' directions is small relative to higher - order terms , and ignoring the latter in the tadpole calculation leads to the apparent ir problem .",
    "it is , in fact , the more severe @xmath248 divergence which leads to @xmath249 .",
    "one can see this by noting that for a random permutation of the clock momenta @xmath250 in the ir , and this is convergent .",
    "this is despite the fact that there are the flat directions with @xmath244 .",
    "the upshot of this discussion is that we can not quantitatively trust the weak - coupling calculation of @xmath251 for the locked vacua if @xmath252 at fixed @xmath65 .",
    "how does this affect the free - energy @xmath228 which we discussed above for the locked vacua ?",
    "it follows from that @xmath253 and so the leading order term is ir safe , while the subleading term can not be trusted in a gaussian analysis .",
    "since our previous discussion was based on the leading @xmath6 term , it remains valid .",
    "returning to the issue of ssb , we need to know whether the large-@xmath0 divergence of @xmath254 implies that the system will fluctuate into nearby locked vacua ( which have momenta differing by center - transformations or reflections ) . we know that there will be large fluctuations in the directions given by transpositions between close momenta , for these are the source of the ir divergence .",
    "thus to address the question we proceed as follows .",
    "it is possible to move from one locked vacuum to another by stringing together a sequence of transpositions involving nearby @xmath58 s ( i.e. with @xmath181 always of @xmath4 ) . as we proceed along such a string , the momenta become partially unlocked , and the energy barriers to transpositions increase from of @xmath255 to of @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , they all still vanish as @xmath12 , so there is a vanishing energy barrier between locked vacua . what matters , however , is whether there is a free - energy barrier .",

    "3 .   a combination of a cabibbo - marinari heat - bath ( again applied in turn to @xmath286 subgroups ) and various type of over - relaxations ( both @xmath286 and @xmath1 , the latter using the method of ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "these are applied after using two gaussian auxiliary fields to make the action linear in the @xmath57 .",
    "we use a ratio of one heat - bath update for every four over - relaxations .",
    "the details of this algorithm are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we find that the second algorithm typically decorrelates our measured quantities most rapidly , and we use this for most of our runs .",
    "all the measurements in this paper were separated by 5 full updates of all four @xmath57 s .",
    "we perform the evaluation of the quenched average , , using one of the following two strategies .",
    "the only exception is for @xmath156 , for which no average is necessary .",
    "0.5 cm    0.5 cm here we simply follow the quenching recipe laid out above : generate an ensemble of sets of momenta weighted by the distribution @xmath82 , calculate @xmath287 for each member of this ensemble , and then average over the ensemble .",
    "we have analyzed the qek with this strategy for all choices of @xmath82 listed above , except @xmath288 , but have mostly focused on @xmath137 .",
    "0.5 cm    0.5 cm    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ qek_equiv ] , if reduction is valid , then one need not perform the momentum integral at large-@xmath0a single value @xmath289 is sufficient , since the sum over color indices will sample the brillouin zone .",
    "we refer to this possibility as self - averaging . for the choice @xmath290 ,",
    "self - averaging is , in principle , exact for all finite @xmath0 , because , as explained in sec .",
    "[ qek_rho_choices ] , @xmath291 here , for each @xmath56 , @xmath292 can be any permutation of the clock momenta @xmath293 defined in .",
    "we recall that holds because the integral over @xmath57 includes all permutations of the elements of @xmath44 . for @xmath294",
    ", we often use @xmath295 for all @xmath56 ( which we call @xmath296 ) .",
    "the self - averaging strategy is not guaranteed to work in practice , because it may be that the simulation fails to fully explore all possible permutations due to algorithmic shortcomings  @xcite . to check whether this happens it is useful to measure quantities which change as one moves from one permutation to another , and we use the order parameters @xmath198 [ ] for this purpose .",
    "it is important , however , to distinguish such an algorithmic failure from a genuine breakdown of reduction . in the latter case , most of the permutations will have higher free energy , and will be visited with a probability which vanishes as @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , if spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs ( as is possible with @xmath155 or @xmath156 ) then , as @xmath12 , the system fluctuates around a single vacuum due to the infinite barrier between vacua connected by particular permutations .",
    "we begin by determining the dependence of the average plaquette , @xmath297 and of the @xmath198 , as a function of @xmath65 in the range @xmath298 .",
    "we use the self - averaging strategy , and have used all choices of @xmath82 .",
    "our focus in this section is on qualitative features , and at this level we do not find much dependence on the choice of @xmath82 . for brevity , therefore , we only present results for @xmath299 .",
    "corrections for @xmath300 are very large for @xmath301 and smear a strong - to - weak transition that occurs at about @xmath302 .",
    "this observation was also reported in ref .",

    "we use `` hysteresis runs '' starting either from a `` cold '' field configuration with @xmath303 at a high value of @xmath304 , or from a `` hot '' field configuration with @xmath305 at a low value of @xmath306 . for a cold ( hot )",
    "start we gradually decrease ( increase ) @xmath65 until we reach the value @xmath307 .",

    "in this paper we have studied the validity of large-@xmath0 reduction for the four dimensional quenched eguchi - kawai model .",
    "this model is a variant of the original eguchi - kawai model in which the distribution of the eigenvalues of the link matrices is forced to be uniform by quenching , while all other degrees of freedom remain dynamical .",
    "we find that while enforcing a uniform eigenvalue distribution is indeed a necessary condition for large-@xmath0 reduction to hold , it is not sufficient .",
    "the reason is that quenching fixes the eigenvalues only up to permutations that can be performed independently in the four directions .",
    "these permutations occur dynamically in the model due to fluctuations in the unquenched degrees of freedom , and can lead to correlations between the ordering of the eigenvalues of the four link matrices . if such correlations occur then we show that the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite for the validity of the large-@xmath0 quenched reduction break down .",
    "the question then is whether such correlations between link eigenvalues occur .",
    "we show that they are indeed expected in the weak - coupling regime by minimizing the free energy with respect to the ordering of the eigenvalues .",
    "this then leads us to perform a detailed numerical study of the qek model with intermediate and strong couplings using monte - carlo techniques .",
    "we find the weak - coupling calculation is indeed a good guide and obtain the following evidence for the breakdown of large-@xmath0 reduction in the model :    * we observe clear evidence for eigenvalue correlations by measuring order parameters that explicitly probe the correlation between the different link matrices along the different euclidean directions .",
    "* when we compare the plaquette expectation values of the qek model and of large volume lattice gauge theories , we find very large discrepancies that do not go away with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "* when we measure the coupling at which a strong - to - weak transition occurs in the qek model , and compare it to the coupling at which the `` bulk '' transition takes place in large-@xmath0 lattice gauge theories in large volumes , we observe a large discrepancy which is of order 13% , and very significant statistically .",
    "we checked that these conclusions are insensitive to the precise form of the quenched eigenvalue distribution , and to the way we perform the quenched average .",
    "we also considered values of @xmath0 up to @xmath257 to look for a late onset of @xmath222 behavior , but find none .",
    "we conclude that the momentum quenched large-@xmath0 reduction of @xmath1 lattice gauge theories fails in the continuum limit .",
    "we have focused in this paper on the behavior in the weak coupling region , since this is where a continuum limit might be taken .",
    "nevertheless , it is also interesting to consider the status of reduction in the strong coupling regime . in the strong - coupling expansion",
    "no eigenvalue correlations appear and so the qek model is expected to be equivalent to the @xmath309 gauge theory for large enough  t hooft coupling @xmath310 .",
    "it follows that reduction is valid until a transition occurs into a phase in which eigenvalue correlations appear . for the quenched eguchi - kawai",
    "this occurs at the strong - to - weak transition .",
    "we have checked numerically that the eigenvalue correlations do vanish on the strong - coupling side of this transition .",
    "a similar picture holds for both the ek and tek models : reduction holds for large enough @xmath310 but is lost below a certain coupling",
    ". we stress , however , that this transition coupling differs for all three theories ( and also differs from the bulk transition coupling for @xmath309 ) .",
    "this is just a reflection of the fact that the weak - coupling phases in these theories are unrelated .    these results , together with those of refs .",
    "@xcite concerning the tek model , mean that , currently , only two single - site models are known that can possibly reproduce the properties of qcd at large-@xmath0 .",
    "the first is the `` deformed '' eguchi - kawai ( dek ) model , which is the single - site example of a class of models proposed very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the dek ,",
    "the action of the eguchi - kawai model is deformed so that breakdown of the @xmath311 symmetry is energetically disfavored , and yet at the same time the large-@xmath0 dynamics is not modified . thus in this model",
    "the original eguchi - kawai proof of reduction is expected to remain valid . in preliminary calculations of the dek model",
    "we see that this deformation must include terms that decorrelate the gauge fields in different euclidean directions , and this makes a direct connection to our results in the qek model , where we see that such correlation is dynamically preferred .",
    "deformation comes , however , at a cost . adding all possible deformations is likely to be prohibitively expensive , because there are @xmath312 in four dimensions .",
    "whether one can improve this scaling by wise choices of the deformations is a subject for future investigation .",
    "the other single - site candidate is the model obtained by adding @xmath313 majorana adjoint quarks , with periodic boundary conditions , to the eguchi - kawai action @xcite . here",
    "the one - loop potential for the link eigenvalues is repulsive if the quark mass in units of the lattice spacing , @xmath314 , is small enough , and reduction is expected to hold . by taking @xmath315 and yet @xmath316 much larger than the confinement scale @xmath174 , this single site model should reproduce the pure yang - mills theory in the ir , and it remains to be seen how such a construction compares computationally to that of @xcite . for @xmath317",
    "this model describes the large-@xmath0 limit of qcd with adjoint quarks which , for @xmath318 , is expected to confine and to be related to @xmath319-color qcd through the orientifold large-@xmath0 equivalence . for @xmath320 this model is expected to be close to conformal , and also of interest .",
    "we leave the exploration of both these single - site models to future studies .        for a recent review",
