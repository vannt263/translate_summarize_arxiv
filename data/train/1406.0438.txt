    "the present paper is part of a research program that uses global dynamical systems methods to study spatially homogeneous cosmological models and cosmological perturbations for a wide variety of sources and gravity theories .",
    "the overall purpose of this program is : ( i ) to produce regularized global dynamical systems in order to obtain a global picture of the solution space of various cosmological models , thus determining the possible and likely cosmological consequences of different physical assumptions .",
    "( ii ) to describe the asymptotic features of the models .",
    "( iii ) to introduce and assess different approximation schemes that approximately describe solutions in their asymptotic regimes , and to combine them to give the entire solutions approximatively , in global dynamical systems settings .    to achieve",
    "the above goals require the introduction of various more or less sophisticated mathematical techniques in an area that to a large extent is dominated by heuristic arguments and local considerations .",
    "this is the price to be payed in order to achieve clarified rigor and to obtain a global understanding of cosmological possibilities that contextualize various heuristic results when they are essentially correct , and to sometimes reveal that some heuristic beliefs are actually unfounded myths that rather reflect hopes than what is actually the case .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a scalar field that is minimally coupled to the einstein equations in flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology with a quadratic potential .",
    "this is a simple and thoroughly studied problem and this is precisely why we choose it ; the main purpose with the present paper is to present new ideas and methods in the setting of this familiar problem which are subsequently to be used ( and sometimes modified ) in a series of forthcoming papers that address increasingly complicated and therefore less understood problems .",
    "moreover , some of the results for the current model turn out to reflect some rather general features , valid for much more general problems .",
    "it should , however , be pointed out that discussions about the recent results of bicep2  @xcite ( see e.g.  @xcite as examples of recent reactions to bicep2 ) also motivate taking a renewed look at the classic problem of a minimally coupled scalar field with a quadratic potential .",
    "the present scalar field problem has a quite long history . for brevity",
    "we only give the key historical references that serve as the starting point for the present work , namely the papers by belinski _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , rendall  @xcite , and liddle _ et al_.  @xcite .",
    "( a few other examples of references that describe minimally coupled scalar field cosmology in dynamical systems settings are  @xcite , with additional references therein . )",
    "the first goal of this paper is to present a global dynamical systems picture of the solution space , which furthermore gives a clear picture of the various past and future asymptotic states .",
    "this naturally brings the so - called attractor solution into focus in a global dynamical systems setting .",
    "the second goal is to determine possible asymptotic behavior at early and late times .",
    "in particular we establish that late time behavior is associated with a particular type of asymptotic self - similarity breaking . at early times",
    "we show that the generic asymptotes are given by a massless scalar field state while a special type of de sitter state describes the asymptotic behavior of the so - called attractor solution .",
    "the third goal is to introduce , describe and assess a variety of approximation techniques that all boil down to giving an approximation for the attractor solution . in particular",
    ", we will show that the familiar slow - roll approximation and its slow - roll expansion extensions is just such an approximation scheme for the attractor solution at early times .",
    "this suggests that one should explicitly take the past asymptotic behavior of the attractor solution as the starting point for an approximation scheme .",
    "the attractor solution turns out to originate from a non - hyperbolic fixed point , which can be treated by means of center manifold theory to yield an expansion that gives an approximation for the attractor solution .",
    "in addition we show how so - called pad ( or , more generally , canterbury ) approximants can be used to analytically improve the range and rate of convergence for the various approximation expansions .",
    "the fourth goal is to combine the center manifold based pad approximants and the approximate solutions for the non - self - similar behavior at late times to obtain global approximations for the attractor solution .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we first present a regular unconstrained 2-dimensional dynamical system on a compact state space for a scalar field with a quadratic potential that is minimally coupled to the einstein equations in flat flrw cosmology .",
    "we then perform a global dynamical systems analysis identifying future and past behavior , and it is shown that the so - called attractor solution corresponds to a 1-dimensional unstable center submanifold of a certain non - hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "in particular we derive series expansions and improve their convergence properties and range by using pad approximants .",
    "we also give approximations for the behavior at late times and use this together with the center manifold results to provide a global analytical approximate description of the attractor solution . in section  [ sec : slowroll ] we extend the slow - roll approximant results of liddle _ et al_.  @xcite to higher orders , and show how they provide approximations for the attractor solution in the present global dynamical systems context .",
    "these results , in combination with numerics , are then compared with the center manifold results to assess the accuracy and range of the various types of approximations . in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] we further discuss our results and their implications for more general potentials and models .",
    "the einstein and scalar field equations for a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath0 with potential @xmath1 for flat flrw cosmology are given by    [ hphieq ] @xmath2    where an overdot signifies the derivative with respect to synchronous time , @xmath3 . throughout we use ( reduced planck ) units such that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the speed of light and @xmath6 is the gravitational constant .",
    "( in the inflationary literature the gravitational constant @xmath6 is often replaced by the planck mass , @xmath7 . ) in addition , @xmath8 is the hubble variable , which is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the cosmological scale factor , and throughout we assume an expanding universe , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath12 is defined via @xmath13 , and due to   it is therefore given by @xmath14 it is also of interest to define the effective equation of state parameter @xmath15 : @xmath16 and hence @xmath17 , a relation that holds for an arbitrary potential in flat flrw cosmology .",
    "heuristically @xmath18 in eq .   can be viewed as an energy which according to eq .   is decreasing .",
    "furthermore , eq .   can be interpreted as describing a nonlinearly damped harmonic oscillator , where @xmath19 is the friction term , which suggests that the scalar field @xmath20 oscillates with decreasing amplitude toward the future and that @xmath21 , which is indeed the case . however , in these variables @xmath12 in eq",
    ".   becomes ill - defined , and the above heuristic picture says nothing about what happens with this important physical observable .",
    "moreover , reversing the time direction leads to a heuristic picture of a harmonic oscillator that gains energy , but in the past limit where @xmath22 the energy driving term @xmath19 becomes ill - defined and again the heuristic picture breaks down .",
    "one might take the viewpoint that the limit @xmath22 is irrelevant since it would take one beyond the planck regime where the classical description fails , but this would be a mistake . as we will see , an understanding of the classical limit @xmath22 is necessary in order to understand the situation for large @xmath8 , where the classical picture is expected to hold .",
    "furthermore , these heuristic considerations only yield rough _ qualitative _ pictures , which in addition say little about the asymptotic regimes . to obtain _ quantitative _ results , and to obtain results that yield a global dynamical picture , illustrating the entire solution space and its properties , requires a reformulation of the field equations that regularize them on a bounded state space that includes the limits @xmath22 and @xmath23 .      to obtain a global dynamical system on a relatively compact state space , which can be regularly extended to include its boundary",
    ", we define    [ tthetadef ] @xmath24    and a new independent variable @xmath25 , @xmath26 which leads to the dynamical system    [ dynsys ] @xmath27    the physical relatively compact state space @xmath28 is defined by a finite cylinder with @xmath29 and @xmath30 as invariant boundary subsets , which can be included to yield the state space @xmath31 .",
    "the interpretation in terms of a cylinder is perhaps most easily seen by introducing @xmath32 and the two variables @xmath33 together with the time choice @xmath25 , this leads to a 3-dimensional dynamical system for @xmath34 obeying the constraint  , which takes the form @xmath35 and thus @xmath36 and @xmath37 describe a cylinder with unit radius . solving the constraint   globally by introducing @xmath38 via @xmath39 yields the present dynamical systems formulation .",
    "note that the system   admits a discrete symmetry since it is invariant under the transformation @xmath40 , which is a reflection of that @xmath41 is invariant under @xmath42 .    in terms of the new variables the hubble variable @xmath8 , the scalar field @xmath20 , and @xmath43 ,",
    "are given by    [ newvar ] @xmath44    and hence constant @xmath32 surfaces in the state space @xmath28 correspond to constant values of @xmath8 .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath12 and the effective equation of state parameter @xmath15 are given by    @xmath45    as a consequence a solution is accelerating as long as @xmath46 ( for future use in figures , note that @xmath47 ) .",
    "note that the present variables are the same as those used by rendall in  @xcite , where @xmath32 was denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath25 by @xmath49 , although the present state space was never used for global purposes in that paper .",
    "in addition , @xmath32 and @xmath38 are closely related to the variables @xmath50 used in e.g.  @xcite , where @xmath51 in the flat flrw case while @xmath52 corresponds to the present @xmath38 . however , that work used different projections to describe the dynamics . in our opinion",
    "the presently used state space description has the advantage of clearly giving a global description of the dynamics , including at past and future asymptotic times .",
    "finally , it should also be pointed out that the system   is a _ reduced _ system .",
    "the equation for the scale factor @xmath53 has been decoupled .",
    "this equation is obtained from @xmath54 , where the above changes of independent and dependent variables yield @xmath55 which leads to a quadrature for @xmath53 once the system   has been solved .",
    "if one furthermore wants to express things in terms of the synchronous proper time variable @xmath3 , one needs to integrate the relation @xmath56 , which follows from eqs .   and  .",
    "although the system   gives an illustrative global picture of the solution space , it might not yield the best variables for describing non - global state space structures .",
    "below we are going to be interested in approximating the attractor solutions at early times . in this case",
    "we obtain a simpler system , which results in a more convenient analysis , by introducing the variables    [ dynsystildet ] @xmath57    and a new independent variable @xmath58 , @xmath59 which in an inflationary context can be viewed as the number of @xmath60-folds @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "this leads to the ( auxiliary ) dynamical system    [ dynsys2 ] @xmath63    which can be obtained from   by taking the small @xmath32 limit .    that there exist dynamical systems that describe local dynamics more conveniently than systems that describe the dynamics globally should not come as a surprise : different regimes induce extra structures which can be used in dynamical systems formulations .",
    "near initial singularities it is natural to adapt both dependent and independent variables to the hubble ( equivalently , the expansion ) variable , due to that the hubble variable provides a natural scale in this regime , as discussed in e.g.  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the oscillatory regime at late times in the present case depends on the minimum of the potential which is characterized by @xmath64 , and thus @xmath65 provides the natural scale in the late time regime .",
    "these features are reflected in our choice of global variable @xmath66 and independent variable @xmath25 , defined via @xmath67 , which incorporate ( and interpolate between ) the two natural asymptotic scales .      to perform a dynamical systems analysis of the global system",
    "we need concepts and techniques from dynamical systems theory . for the reader",
    "s convenience we therefore first recall some basic mathematical definitions , while various techniques and results from the theory of dynamical systems are introduced subsequently according to when they are needed ( for further details , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "consider an autonomous dynamical system @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the evolution of a state space point of the dynamical system is described by the flow , which formally is a mapping @xmath70 that yields @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72-limit set @xmath73 of a point @xmath74 is defined as the set of all accumulation points of the future orbit ( i.e. solution trajectory ) through @xmath75 . correspondingly , the @xmath76-limit set @xmath77 is defined as the set of accumulation points of the past orbit .",
    "the @xmath72-limit of a set @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath72-limit sets ( @xmath76-limit sets ) characterize the future ( the past ) asymptotic behavior of the dynamical system .",
    "the simplest examples of limit sets are fixed points ( i.e. , points @xmath80 in the state space of the dynamical system @xmath68 for which @xmath81 ; sometimes fixed points are referred to as equilibrium , critical or stationary points ) and periodic orbits .",
    "we begin our analysis of the global dynamical system   by noting that @xmath82 as seen from   and   @xmath32 is a monotonically increasing function on @xmath28 ( hence @xmath32 can be viewed as a time variable if one is so inclined ) and as a consequence all orbits originate from the invariant subset boundary @xmath29 ( which therefore contains the @xmath76-limit set of @xmath28 ) , which is associated with the asymptotic ( classical ) initial state where @xmath22 , and end at the invariant subset boundary @xmath30 , which corresponds to the asymptotic future where @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the equation on the invariant boundary subset @xmath30 is given by @xmath84 , and hence yields a periodic orbit in the negative @xmath38 direction ; due to that @xmath32 is monotonically increasing on @xmath28 , it follows that this periodic orbit is a limit cycle that constitutes the global future attractor , being the @xmath72-limit set for all orbits in the physical state space @xmath28 .",
    "next we turn to the fixed points on @xmath31 .",
    "recall that a fixed point is _ hyperbolic _ if the linearization of the system at the fixed point is a matrix that possesses eigenvalues with non - vanishing real parts . in this case",
    "the _ hartman - grobman theorem _ applies : in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic fixed point the full nonlinear dynamical system and the linearized system are topologically equivalent .",
    "the hartman - grobman theorem establishes the local stability properties of a hyperbolic fixed point , but it should be pointed out that there is no guarantee that the linearized solution yield an approximation for the solutions in the neighborhood of the fixed point . _ non - hyperbolic fixed points _ have linearizations with one or more eigenvalues with vanishing real parts .",
    "the only fixed points of the system   on the cylinder @xmath85 are those on the invariant subset @xmath29 , and , as can be easily seen , they are connected by _ heteroclinic orbits _ , and thus there are no homoclinic orbits ( an orbit whose @xmath72- and @xmath76-limit set is a fixed point is called a heteroclinic orbit ; a homoclinic orbit originates from and ends at one and the same fixed point ) . since @xmath86 ,",
    "the fixed points are determined by the following values for @xmath38 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is an integer .",
    "there are two equivalent ( due to the discrete symmetry ) hyperbolic fixed points @xmath89 , for which @xmath90 and @xmath91 , i.e. , they are associated with a massless scalar field state , and two equivalent fixed points @xmath92 , for which @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which therefore correspond to a de sitter state .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the present de sitter fixed points are distinct from de sitter states that are associated with potentials that admit situations for which @xmath95 for some constant finite value of @xmath20 for which both @xmath96 and @xmath8 have constant , bounded , and positive values .",
    "in contrast the present de sitter states correspond to the limits @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "the massless scalar field fixed points , @xmath89 , are hyperbolic sources , while the de sitter fixed points , @xmath92 , are sinks _ on _ @xmath29 ( they have one negative eigenvalue associated with the @xmath29 subset given by @xmath99 ) , but they also have one zero eigenvalue that corresponds to a 1-dimensional unstable center submanifold ( and thus they are non - hyperbolic in @xmath31 ) , to be discussed below , and thus one solution originates from each fixed point @xmath92 into @xmath28 .",
    "the solutions that originate from @xmath92 are often referred to as ` attractor solutions , ' a nomenclature that for the present scalar field potential originates from the work by belinski _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "the nomenclature has been motivated by heuristic linear analysis , which indicates that the attractor solutions are locally stable . as can be shown numerically ,",
    "it is even true that solutions that correspond to initial data quite far from the attractor solution , where a linear analysis would not be valid , rapidly approach it in the present variables .",
    "nevertheless , it is also clear that there exists an open set of non - inflating solutions that only come close to the attractor solution near the future global attractor at @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that there exists such an open set of solutions brings up the issue of imposing a measure on the state space , a problem already recognized by belinski _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that it is possible to make a nonlinear variable change so that the attractor solutions are not locally stable everywhere and hence the nomenclature ` attractor solution ' is of rather heuristic nature ( for further discussions about the meaning of ` attractor solutions ' and measures , see the recent papers by remmen and carroll  @xcite and by corichi and sloan  @xcite , and references therein ) .    furthermore , it is worth noting that there already exists a non - trivial example of this . in the global state space for the modified chaplygin gas used in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the perfect fluid attractor solution is not attracting nearby solutions everywhere along its evolution .",
    "nevertheless , there exists an open set of solutions that are always arbitrarily close to it during their intermediate and late time evolution .",
    "these results are to be contrasted with previous work , which had established linear stability of the attractor solution in terms of other variables .",
    "it should also be pointed out that ( apart from the case of an exponential potential ) scalar field problems have reduced state spaces with more than one dimension , and that usually the linear stability analysis that motivates calling a solution an attractor solution in the literature only makes use of a single variable , e.g. @xmath8 , but stability in one variable such as @xmath8 does not guarantee stability in additional dimensions . instead of using measures to make sense of the attracting properties of the attractor solution one can consider the evolution of physical measurable observables and study if they evolve toward the attractor solution . in figure",
    "[ fig : hq ] we have plotted the attractor solution in @xmath100-space just before the oscillatory regime together with other solutions for various initial data , and , as can be seen , solutions are indeed ` attracted ' toward the attractor solution . nevertheless , it should be pointed out that the formal mathematical future global attractor is the periodic orbit on the invariant @xmath30 boundary subset .",
    "( loosely speaking , in dynamical systems theory attractor behavior describes situations where a collection of , in some sense , generic state space points evolve into a certain ` attractor ' region from which they never leave . for a formal definition of a dynamical systems attractor ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , and references therein . )    finally , note that @xmath101 is a surjective two - to - one map , i.e. , ( as can be expected ) each solution only appears once in the state space of the geometric observables @xmath102 instead of twice in @xmath28 .",
    "it is possible to use e.g. @xmath103 $ ] ( or @xmath104 $ ] ) as a bounded state space , but @xmath93 and @xmath90 ( @xmath105 ) are not invariant boundaries in such a formulation , which lead to analytic difficulties . as a consequence it is therefore preferable to use the state space @xmath28 , since it is bounded by invariant boundaries in an analytic manner which makes it possible to extend the state space to @xmath31 .    to summarize the global picture of the solution space on @xmath28 :",
    "all orbits except for the two equivalent attractor solutions , which originate from @xmath106 and @xmath107 , originate from the two equivalent sources @xmath108 and @xmath109 , while all solutions asymptotically approach the periodic orbit on the @xmath30 invariant boundary subset , which hence is the future global attractor .",
    "this situation is depicted in figure  [ fig : phasespace ] , which gives a global state space description of the solution space .",
    "note that the heuristic description in terms of a damped harmonic oscillator does not reveal that there are two equivalent attractor solutions that originate from a de sitter state while all other solutions originate from a massless scalar field state , nor does it reveal that the final state is one for which dimensionless physical observables such as the deceleration parameter @xmath12 oscillate with a constant amplitude .      to obtain approximations for solutions at late times close to @xmath30 ( the oscillatory phase ) ,",
    "we take the average with respect to @xmath38 of the right hand side of   ( since @xmath110 while @xmath32 slowly approaches one ) , which leads to    [ dynsysaverage ] @xmath111    it follows that @xmath112 where @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is some initial point for the trajectory ( for heuristic work on oscillatory late time behavior for monomial scalar field potentials , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this approximation is valid for all solutions when @xmath32 approaches one , including the center manifold attractor solution , see figure  [ fig : average ] .    in",
    "@xcite rendall gave rigorous results for late time behavior , which to leading order corroborates the relation given in eq .",
    ", but rendall also refined this approximation .",
    "in particular he proved results that can be translated to the following asymptotic approximation  @xcite : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a constant and @xmath3 is synchronous time ( with @xmath65 normalized to one ) ; note that   is obtained in the limit @xmath117 .",
    "the relations given in eq .   describe a parameterized curve in the global state space @xmath28 , which is plotted in figure  [ fig : osc ] ; note that the oscillatory approximation becomes increasingly good toward the future , reflecting that it describes the asymptotic evolution at late times .",
    "alternatively , improved late time approximations ( explicitly including oscillatory behavior ) can be obtained by using the averaged solution as a starting point for more accurate approximations in the manner illustrated in  @xcite for the case of perfect fluid dynamics in bianchi type vii@xmath118 at late times .",
    "these models , like the present ones , provide an example of _ asymptotic manifest self - similarity breaking _ at late times , where asymptotic ( continuous ) manifest self - similarity is defined by the requirement that all physical geometrical scale - invariant observables such as the deceleration parameter @xmath12 take asymptotic constant values ( the issue of asymptotic manifest self - similarity breaking turns out to be quite subtle and we will return to it more thoroughly in a forthcoming paper ) . since the future attractor in the present case is a limit cycle it follows that @xmath12 is asymptotically oscillating , and thus that asymptotic manifest self - similarity is broken .",
    "incidentally , the late time behavior in @xmath119-space is associated with a non - hyperbolic fixed point at the origin which acts as an attracting focus .",
    "this is rather misleading since the existence of an attracting fixed point might lead one to believe that the late time dynamics is asymptotically manifestly self - similar ; the true situation , i.e. asymptotic manifest self - similarity breaking , is only revealed by resolving the non - hyperbolicity of the fixed point , which leads to the present picture with a limit cycle .",
    "next we will extend the center manifold analysis of  @xcite ( a paper that was inspired by  @xcite ) , which describes the ( equivalent ) attractor solutions that originate from @xmath92 . to do",
    "so we first briefly review some aspects of center manifold analysis that are needed for the present problem , which can be regarded as a specific application ( for more details concerning center manifolds , see e.g.  @xcite ; for recent uses of center manifold analysis in cosmology , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "assume that there exists a fixed point @xmath120 of a dynamical system @xmath121 , @xmath122 and that the linearization of the system at @xmath120 is described by a matrix that can be diagonalized .",
    "accordingly , the phase space @xmath123 of the linearized equations can be decomposed into the direct sum @xmath124 of the stable subspace @xmath125 ( spanned by the eigenvectors of the eigenvalues with negative real parts ) , the unstable subspace @xmath126 ( spanned by the eigenvectors of the eigenvalues with positive real parts ) and the center subspace @xmath127 ( spanned by the eigenvectors of the eigenvalues with vanishing real parts ) .",
    "these subspaces of the linearized system form the tangent spaces to associated invariant submanifolds of the full system ( which therefore have the same dimension as the tangent spaces ) , which are denoted by @xmath128 for the stable manifold , @xmath129 for the unstable manifold , and @xmath130 for the center manifold .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we locate the fixed point @xmath120 at @xmath131 and choose variables such that the dynamical system can be written as    [ fullnonlinear ] @xmath132    here @xmath133 is @xmath134-dimensional while @xmath135 is ( @xmath136)-dimensional ; @xmath137 is a constant @xmath138 matrix with purely imaginary ( or zero ) eigenvalues ; @xmath139 is a constant @xmath140 matrix for which all eigenvalues have nonzero real parts ; finally , @xmath141 and @xmath142 denote the nonlinear terms .    since the center manifold @xmath130 is an invariant manifold in the phase space @xmath123 that contains @xmath120 and that is tangent to @xmath127 , one can describe @xmath130 , in a neighborhood of @xmath120 , as the graph of a function @xmath143 , i.e. , @xmath144 , where for sufficiently small @xmath145 the point @xmath146 belongs to @xmath130 . inserting the relation @xmath144 into   yields the following differential equation for @xmath147 : @xmath148= a_2 h(x_1 ) + n_2(x_1,h(x_1)),\\ ] ] which also satisfies @xmath149 ( fixed point condition ) and @xmath150 ( tangency condition ) .",
    "usually , however , it is not possible to solve  .",
    "instead this equation can be solved approximately by representing @xmath151 as a formal ( usually truncated ) power series , and solve for the constant coefficients to any desired order .",
    "the hartman - grobman theorem can be generalized to the shoshitaishvili theorem ( sometimes referred to as the reduction theorem ) for the present situation of a non - hyperbolic fixed point :    [ shoshitaishvili](shoshitaishvili theorem ) .",

    "in this paper we have used the minimally coupled scalar field with a quadratic potential in flat flrw cosmology to illustrate how a global dynamical system can yield a global understanding of the solution space as well as the solution s asymptotic features .",
    "we have also used center manifold expansions and pad approximants to obtain approximations for the attractor solution at early times .",
    "in addition we have showed that late time asymptotics for all solutions is associated with a limit cycle that demonstrates that the present models exhibit future asymptotic manifest self - similarity breaking , which physically corresponds to that physical dimensionless observables such as the deceleration parameter have no future asymptotic limits , but instead oscillate .",
    "this is an issue that becomes even more pertinent when one includes additional sources such as perfect fluids and we will return to this in a forthcoming paper dealing with scalar fields with monomial potentials and perfect fluids . in this case",
    "there is a ` competition ' between the different matter sources , reminiscent of the dynamics of lotka - volterra systems , as described in  @xcite .",
    "in addition we have shown that the slow - roll approximation and expansions are actually a collage of two types of approximations that describe the early behavior of the attractor solution .",
    "these approximations were subsequently compared with the center manifold approximations .",
    "it was found that center manifold expansions and associated approximants have a larger range of convergence than the slow - roll approximation and associated approximants .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the @xmath176_\\theta$ ] pad approximant gives a better approximation than the slow - roll approximation to the attractor solution everywhere .",
    "the large range of convergence for center manifold approximants made it possible to join them with approximations describing the dynamics at late times to produce global approximations for the attractor solution .",
    "different convergence properties of various approximation schemes might have far reaching consequences , so let us therefore take a closer look at the slow - roll approximation",
    ". expressed in @xmath38 and @xmath32 the slow - roll approximation takes the following form for the quadratic scalar field potential : @xmath179 performing a taylor expansion around @xmath29 yields @xmath180 a comparison with the center manifold expansion given in eq .",
    "shows that it is only the first two terms that coincide . for every other order the errors for the slow - roll expansion in   are larger than those in  , and a similar statement holds for the associated pad approximants .",
    "it is only the exact translations of the slow - roll hubble expansions and canterbury approximants that give competitive results for small @xmath32 when compared with the lower order center manifold expansions , which in turn corresponds to nonlinear variable transformations between @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "thus the present paper provides specific examples of how nonlinear transformations and different approximation schemes significantly affects convergence rates and ranges for flat flrw cosmology with a minimally coupled scalar field with a quadratic potential , which should not come as a surprise .",
    "nevertheless , this leads to the following questions : is it possible to find nonlinear transformations , and other approximation schemes , that yield even more accurate approximations with a larger range of convergence than the slow - roll and center manifold expansions and pad and canterbury approximants ?",
    "to what extent does the conclusions we have obtained for the minimally coupled scalar field with a quadratic potential hold for other scalar field potentials and other gravity theories ? as an aside , it is interesting to note that somewhat similar issues occur in cosmography , as exemplified by e.g.  @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the above issues are intriguing and we will return to them in future work .",
    "in particular we are going to show that many of the main results and conclusions in the present paper can be generalized to sources that consist of more general scalar field potentials and perfect fluids in a forthcoming paper ( both as regards global aspects and how to improve on slow - roll approximations ) , although additional , sometimes somewhat surprising , aspects and phenomena to those discussed in the present paper occur as well .",
