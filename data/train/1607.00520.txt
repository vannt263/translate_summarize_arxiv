    "<S> we demonstrate that time - domain ptychography , a recently introduced ultrafast pulse reconstruction modality , has properties ideally suited for the temporal characterization of complex light pulses with large time - bandwidth products as it achieves temporal resolution on the scale of a single optical cycle using long probe pulses , low sampling rates , and an extremely fast and robust algorithm . in comparison to existing techniques , ptychography minimizes the data to be recorded and processed , and drastically reduces the computational time of the reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally we measure the temporal waveform of an octave - spanning , 3.5  ps long supercontinuum pulse generated in photonic crystal fiber , resolving features as short as 5.7  fs with sub - fs resolution and 30  db dynamic range using 100  fs probe pulses and similarly large delay steps .    </S>",
    "<S> supercontinuum ( sc ) generation has become a scientific and commercial success story , in particular driven by photonic crystal fiber ( pcf ) technology . tailored fiber - based sc sources delivering spectral bandwidths of one octave and more </S>",
    "<S> are now routinely applied in bio - photonic imaging , microscopy , frequency metrology , and nonlinear pulse compression , to name only a few @xcite . despite such wide - spread use , the full characterization of such sc pulses remains extremely challenging as their temporal waveforms are amongst the most complex to be found in ultrafast optics . </S>",
    "<S> their envelope is typically several picoseconds long , but contains fine structure on the scale of just a few femtoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> combined with their ultrabroad and equally complex sprectrum they easily reach time - bandwidth products ( tbp ) in the order of @xmath0 @xcite .    since no known detector is fast enough to measure such pulses directly , </S>",
    "<S> several schemes for the indirect reconstruction of temporal intensity and phase have been devised , of which cross - correlation frequency resolved optical gating ( xfrog ) in various implementations has been most successful in adequately measuring complex sc pulses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on recording the spectrogram of the unknown object pulse cross - correlated via a nonlinear interaction with a series of known time - delayed gate pulses and iteratively reconstructing the electric field using a derivative of the generalized projections algorithm ( gpa ) @xcite . for the accurate reconstruction of pulses with large tbp high sensitivity , large ranges , and fine resolution in both temporal and spectral domains </S>",
    "<S> have to be achieved simultaneously , which in the case of xfrog entails the recording of a large number of time - gated spectra using short gate pulses . for such complex pulses </S>",
    "<S> the gpa demands the interpolation of the measured spectrogram on a time - frequency grid with a number of points in the order of @xmath1 or more @xcite , all of which makes the experimental measurement and the reconstruction of the pulse a rather cumbersome and computationally intensive task .    </S>",
    "<S> recently time - domain ptychography was introduced as a new modality for ultrafast pulse characterization @xcite , with an application range even extending down to the attosecond regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> originating from lensless spatial imaging , ptychography is based on a powerful phase retrieval algorithm , the ptychographic iterative engine ( pie ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the experimental realization is similar to xfrog in the sense that the cross - correlation spectrogram is recorded , the data processing and the reconstructing algorithm are conceptually very different and offer several key advantages , which become especially relevant in the context of measuring ultra - complex sc pulses : 1 ) the temporal resolution is independent of both the duration of the gate pulse and the time delay increment . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the gate pulse should be much longer than the object pulse ( or longer than the relevant temporal features contained therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) typically only a few spectra have to be recorded since long gate pulses and large delay steps can be used . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) the computational grid size required by pie is orders of magnitudes smaller than the one used in the gpa without compromising temporal resolution , resulting in fast processing and convergence . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate through simulations and experiments that these properties make time - domain ptychography an excellent choice for the efficient and accurate measurement of complex pulses with large tbp .        </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] shows a schematic setup for the implementation of time - domain ptychography of sc pulses . </S>",
    "<S> a modelocked ti : sapphire oscillator generates fourier - limited pulses with 100  fs full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) duration centered at 800  nm with 1  w average power at 76  mhz repetition rate . </S>",
    "<S> the pulses are split into two copies with variable power ratio using a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) and a half - wave plate ( hwp ) and serve both as the pump for the sc generation as well as the gate for the recording of the spectrogram . </S>",
    "<S> the pump pulse is coupled into the fast axis of a 22.5  cm long polarization maintaining pcf ( nkt nl-750 pm ) with a zero - dispersion wavelength ( zdw ) of 760  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the generated sc is collimated and passes through a set of achromatic hwp and pbs that allows to adjust the polarization direction and discard any sc components that might have become depolarized in the pcf . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlated spectrogram @xmath2 is then generated by non - collinearly overlapping the sc field @xmath3 with the time - delayed gate @xmath4 in a @xmath5 m thick nonlinear bbo crystal and recording the spectrum of the sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) signal for different time delays @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> note that it is also possible to use other forms of nonlinear interaction with different gate functions , such as phase - only gates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first perform numerical simulations closely modelled after the experimental setup in order to verify the performance of pie for pulses with large tbp . </S>",
    "<S> we model the sc generation process by numerically solving the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gnlse ) using the dispersive and nonlinear properties provided by the pcf manufacturer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model has a temporal and angular spectral resolution of @xmath7 fs and @xmath8 thz , we assume a pump pulse peak power of 2.5  kw , and also take the collimating , focusing , and polarizing optics after the pcf into account . </S>",
    "<S> since it is well known that the generated sc might suffer from substantial pulse - to - pulse fluctuations if the nonlinear broadening mechanisms are sensitive to shot noise @xcite , we also included quantum noise terms into the gnlse and calculated the spectrally averaged first order degree of coherence @xmath9 from a set of multiple simulations with random noise seeds @xcite . for our conditions @xmath10 , indicating that the spectrogram averaged over a large number of shots does not differ significantly from a single shot measurement . </S>",
    "<S> hence we implement our experiment in a simple multi - shot setup assuming an identical pulse is available at every shot . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that a single - shot scheme for measuring complex spectrograms has recently been devised for a variant of xfrog @xcite , which could easily be adapted for ptychography should this become necessary for measuring pulses with larger fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the result of the gnlse simulation to calculate the spectrogram from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : spectrogram ] ) and pass it to the pie reconstruction algorithm , which works on two essentially independent grids . </S>",
    "<S> the object and gate pulse are sampled on a temporal grid with @xmath11 samples equally spaced by @xmath12 , which is determined by the resolution and the range of the spectrometer used such that @xmath13 . if the spectrogram contains the full spectral range of the pulse , zero padding can be used to increase @xmath11 and consequently adjust the desired temporal resolution of the reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath14 such that @xmath7 fs , both for simulations and experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the second grid is that of time delays and consists of @xmath15 samples equally spaced by @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> ptychographic reconstruction works well as long as @xmath16 is smaller than the fwhm width @xmath17 of the gate pulse , i.e. for a sampling rate @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting redundancy is the basis for the accuracy and robustness of the pie algorithm . thus @xmath16 can be chosen freely within the constraint @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is typically orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath11 , for example in this paper @xmath15 ranges between 3 and 103 , depending on @xmath20 and the desired delay range to be reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> hence pie requires @xmath15 cross - correlated spectra recorded at different time delays @xmath21 between the object and gate pulse , which are combined in the spectrogram @xmath22 sampled on a @xmath23 grid . </S>",
    "<S> no further interpolation is required . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , gpa based schemes work with a spectrogram that has to fulfill the discrete fourier transform relations and hence needs to be interpolated on the delay axis to a @xmath24 grid @xcite . for achieving the same temporal resolution </S>",
    "<S> as we do with pie , an enormous grid size of @xmath25 would have to be processed , independent of the actual delay range of interest . </S>",
    "<S> pie therefore operates with 100 - 3000 times smaller grid size than the gpa . with typically hundreds of iterations needed before convergence </S>",
    "<S> is reached , pie saves computational time in the order of hours compared to gpa on a standard modern pc . </S>",
    "<S> this impressively demonstrates the power of ptychographic reconstruction , which becomes especially apparent when large temporal and spectral ranges have to be combined with fine resolution .        </S>",
    "<S> the simulated and reconstructed spectrograms ( @xmath26 arrays ) with @xmath27 fs and @xmath28 fs ( i.e. @xmath29 ) are displayed in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulation](a ) and [ fig : simulation](b ) on a logarithmic intensity scale with 30  db dynamic range . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum spans the range 570 - 1050 nm , the duration of the pulse is about 3.5 ps , and the tbp is > 500 . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between simulation and reconstruction is excellent , both are visually indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrogram is dominated by the group index profile of the pcf modified by a tilt caused by the dispersive optics in the setup ( dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulation](a ) ) , and consists of a normal ( top ) and anomalous ( bottom ) dispersion arm . the compact objects in the anomalous dispersion arm </S>",
    "<S> can be identified as solitons , while the low - level radiation in the top arm are the corresponding dispersive waves . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal profile of the pulse is dictated by the overlap of these two dispersive arms and the resulting interference structures , which are particularly sensitive to the relative phase of the overlapping components . </S>",
    "<S> two especially challenging structures for the reconstruction are highlighted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulation](c ) : ( i ) the densly packed solitons around @xmath30 , where small relative phase errors will result in large intensity errors ; and ( ii ) the overlap of the strongest soliton with a dispersive wave at @xmath31  fs , which causes an extremely fast temporal beating with 6.5  fs period , equal to the frequency of their spectral separation of about 150  thz . </S>",
    "<S> both structures are perfectly resolved in the reconstruction . finally , the comparison of the spectra in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulation](d ) shows that the ptychographic reconstruction is accurate even down to the -30  db level and hence achieves precise phase retrieval even in sections of the pulse where the spectral intensity is low . </S>",
    "<S> this is a particularly important feature for sc pulse characterization , because the temporal profile critically depends on a correct relative phase across the whole bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions of the visual comparison are confirmed by the root mean square error ( rms ) between original and reconstructed spectrogram , @xmath32 ^ 2}}{n m } } , \\label{eq : rms}\\ ] ] which we found to be limited only by machine precision and the computational time required to achieve it . </S>",
    "<S> here we aborted the pie algorithm when @xmath33 was reached after about 300 iterations .    </S>",
    "<S> next we investigate the behaviour of pie for lower sampling rates by keeping @xmath27  fs fixed and increasing @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : delay ] shows the results of the temporal intensity reconstruction for @xmath16 equal to 70  fs , 90  fs , and 120  fs , focusing on the soliton group around zero delay for better visibility . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath34  fs ( @xmath35 ) , the reconstruction is of equal quality ( @xmath36 ) as the one presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulation ] , but requires only half the number of spectra and half the grid size ( @xmath37 ) . for @xmath38  fs , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 approaches one , further decreasing the required number of spectra , but also the redundancy in the measurement and consequently the rebustness of the reconstruction . nevertheless , the main features are well recovered , with only small relative phase errors leading to slight discrepancies in the intensity of interference features ( @xmath39 ) . for @xmath40  fs , the measurement is undersampled due to @xmath41 , leading to larger errors and we find that @xmath42 does not fall below @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this set of simulations therefore confirms that pie is able to accurately reconstruct the full complexity of the pulse even for large @xmath16 as long as @xmath19 . note that this condition implies that the number of spectra can be further reduced by using longer gate pulses . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally a limit to this rule might be posed by the required peak power in the nonlinear process that creates the cross - correlated signal .    </S>",
    "<S> fs showing spectrogram , temporal intensity and spectral phase for ( a ) @xmath44 and ( b ) @xmath45 spectra . ]    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we highlight the capability of pie to do partial reconstructions , a feature that is particularly useful if only short sections of an sc pulse are of interest . as an example , we focus on the fast temporal beating on the envelope of the soliton at @xmath46  fs . </S>",
    "<S> we again consider @xmath47  fs and @xmath28  fs as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulation ] , but reduce the size of the sampled delay window to the region of interest , thus simulating a partial measurement of the pulse . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : slices ] shows the resulting spectrograms and reconstructions of temporal intensity and spectral phase for delay windows of 490  fs and 70  fs , corresponding to @xmath44 and @xmath45 spectra , respectively . in both cases , the temporal waveform is surprisingly well reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> the retrieved absolute spectral phase does not match the simulation , because there is no available information about the intermediary phase between the two isolated spectral components . </S>",
    "<S> intererestingly , however , the relative phase modulo @xmath48 between the two spectral components is determined accurately , apparent from the correct reconstruction of the phase of the interference pattern in the temporal waveform . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this example pie correctly resolves features on the time scale of two optical cycles using 100  fs probe pulses and requiring only three spectral measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed to the experimental realization using the setup already described above ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a practical challenge of this implementation is that the sfg phase - matching bandwidth of the bbo crystal is smaller than the maximum spectral bandwidth of the sc . </S>",
    "<S> fast angle - dithering of the crystal during the measurement has been shown to solve this problem @xcite , but since pie only requires a small number of spectra we decided to simply repeat the measurement for different crystal angles and obtain the full spectrogram from a superposition after correcting for the phase - matching efficiency versus wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum of three measurements with suitably chosen crystal angles were sufficient to cover the complete sc bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the spectral marginal , i.e. the integral of the measured spectrogram with respect to delay , to an independently measured spectrum ensured the accuracy of the post - processing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> standard background correction and fourier noise filtering were also applied .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exp ] shows measured and reconstructed spectrograms with @xmath47  fs after conversion to fundamental wavelengths for pump peak powers between 200  w and 2.5  kw coupled into the pcf . following the results of the simulations , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34  fs was chosen . </S>",
    "<S> the sampling grid size is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 $ ] for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exp](a)-(c ) , respectively , resulting in a temporal resolution equal to that used previously in the simulations , i.e. @xmath7  fs . </S>",
    "<S> we achieved excellent sensitivity allowing us to record all spectrograms with signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) exceeding 30  db and enabling us to follow the development of the sc from low to high pump powers . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exp](a)-(c ) we observe self - phase modulation , soliton fission , and fully developed sc spectrum with a bandwidth of about one octave , respectively . in all cases , the reconstruction is of excellent quality for an experimentally recorded data set , with @xmath51 for ( a ) , ( b ) and @xmath52 for the broadest spectrum ( c ) , limited mainly by the snr . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction required a computational time of less than 1 minute on a standard laptop computer .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to confirm that both the measured spectrogram and the reconstruction are correct . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exp ] we therefore also show the measured spectral marginal and the retrieved spectrum , and compare both to an independently measured osa spectrum . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is very good , confirming the accuracy of both the measurement procedure and the reconstruction . since there is also a good qualitative agreement between simulated and measured sc spectrogram ( compare figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : simulation ] ( b ) and [ fig : exp ] ( c ) ) , we also know that the shortest temporal feature of the fully developed sc pulse should be the beating caused by the overlap of soliton and dispersive wave at @xmath53  fs with a beat frequency equal to their spectral separation . from the measured spectrogram </S>",
    "<S> we determine that separation to be @xmath54   thz , resulting in an expected oscillation period of about 5.7  fs . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pulse ] shows the reconstructed temporal waveform with a full range of 3.5  ps , where this expected period is exactly recovered and fully resolved . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we also resolve the much weaker temporal beating with a period of 8.2  fs at the edge of the soliton at @xmath55  fs , caused by the overlap with a low - level dispersive wave separated by about 120  thz . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of this oscillation is as low as @xmath56 on the normalized scale . </S>",
    "<S> hence we achieve a dynamic range close to 30  db in the temporal domain .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that time - domain ptychography is a powerful technique for the temporal characterization of complex ultrashort pulses with large tbp . </S>",
    "<S> it is able to accurately resolve features on the scale of a single optical cycle using 100  fs ( or longer ) gate pulses and equally large delay steps , minimizes the number of time - gated spectra to be recorded and processed , and is superior to comparable gpa based techniques in terms of memory requirements and computational speed . </S>"
