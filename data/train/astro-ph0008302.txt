    "the relation between galactic star formation history and the interstellar medium ( ism ) is recorded in the distribution of elements we observe today .",
    "the principal signatures are : ( a ) time - integrated metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) , as exhibited by long - lived stars ; ( b ) instantaneous mdfs at a given time , for example , the present - day dispersion in the inhomogeneous ism ; ( c ) abundance ratios of elements with varying origin and histories ; and ( d ) age - metallicity relations .",
    "a unified understanding of these tracers is fundamental to solving the puzzle of galaxy assembly and evolution .    over the 30 years of work on chemical evolution modeling ,",
    "the constraints offered by ( b ) , the instantaneous mdf , have been relatively neglected .",
    "however , tinsley ( 1975 ) showed early on that chemical inhomogeneity significantly affects the other chemical signatures .",
    "edmunds ( 1975 ) also argued that simplistic inhomogeneous evolution of overlapping supernova remnants , with no mixing , yields a present - day ism that is orders of magnitude _ smoother _ than what is presently observed .",
    "this issue is only rarely discussed ( e.g. , roy & kunth 1995 ) . but recently , the significance of dispersions in the chemical signatures has been reemphasized ( e.g. , wyse 1995 ; van den hoek & de jong 1997 ) .",
    "we are therefore overdue to reexamine inhomogeneous chemical evolution .",
    "picking up threads from the early work , i present here an analytic model that predicts the metallicity dispersion from first principles in the limiting case of no mixing . as a reference",
    ", we return to the standard , simple model ( e.g. , tinsley 1980 ; pagel & patchett 1975 ; schmidt 1963 ) , which assumes : ( 1 ) a closed system , ( 2 ) initially metal - free , ( 3 ) constant stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , and ( 4 ) chemical homogeneity at all times . most previous analytic investigations of inhomogeneous evolution were tied to the simple model , and assumed a given dispersion in metal production : tinsley ( 1975 ) adopted a fixed metallicity dispersion and propagated this through the simple model ; while searle ( 1977 ) and malinie et al .",
    "( 1993 ) considered an ensemble of regions that individually follow the simple model such that they yield a given dispersion .",
    "a different , perhaps simpler , approach , returns to the concept of overlapping regions of contamination , as discussed qualitatively by , e.g , edmunds ( 1975 ) .",
    "we adopt the tenets , except for ( 4 ) , of the simple model .",
    "consider an initially metal - free ism , in which a first generation of star forming regions is randomly distributed , occupying a volume filling factor @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that these individual regions have a distribution of metal production @xmath3 , which is the probability density function for obtaining metallicity @xmath4 at any point affected by star formation .",
    "note that it is not necessary to assume anything specific about the sizes of the individual regions , but only the relative total volumes of contaminated to primordial gas , given by @xmath1 .",
    "we now consider @xmath2 subsequent generations of star formation .",
    "the individual regions also fall randomly in the ism , but for each generation , occupy the same filling factor @xmath1 as the first . the role of this last assumption will become apparent in  4 below . the probability that any given point in the ism is occupied by @xmath5 overlapping regions",
    "is given by the binomial distribution in @xmath2 and @xmath1 : @xmath6 and the probability of a point retaining primordial metallicity is , @xmath7 for our purposes , we define the metallicity @xmath4 to be the mass of metals per unit volume ; the coexisting mass density of h is assumed to be spatially uniform . in accordance with our assumption of no mixing , we assume that the metallicity at any given point is the sum of those contributed by the individual overlapping regions @xmath8 : @xmath9    to obtain the instantaneous mdf after @xmath2 generations , we sum the distributions @xmath10 for individual sets of regions occupied by @xmath5 objects , weighted by their @xmath11 : @xmath12    to derive the total mdf of all objects ever created over @xmath2 generations , we must reduce the total gas mass after each generation @xmath13 by a factor @xmath14 , to account for the conversion of gas into stars .",
    "we assume the reduction increment @xmath15 to be constant , so that the present - day gas fraction @xmath16 .",
    "the total , time - integrated mdf is then : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is @xmath11 for a given generation @xmath13 . note that this treatment for gas consumption assumes that @xmath18 remain unaffected by the reduction of gas .",
    "we now assume that @xmath3 remains the same for all generations . for large @xmath5",
    ", the central limit theorem applies , which predicts that the summed mdf approximates a normal distribution with mean and variance given by @xmath5 times the mean @xmath19 and variance @xmath20 of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is given simply by : @xmath22 where @xmath11 is given by equation  [ binomial ] .",
    "likewise , to estimate @xmath23 for large @xmath13 , the binomial distribution approximates a normal distribution with mean and variance given by @xmath24 thus equation  [ ntot_gen ] may be written : @xmath25 for small @xmath2 , equations  [ nz ] and [ ntot ] break down unless @xmath3 describes a normal distribution .",
    "several considerations suggest that @xmath3 should be given by a power - law . as a rough estimate",
    ", we consider the volume affected by a star - forming region to be that of the superbubble generated by its @xmath26 core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "following oey & clarke ( 1997 ; hereafter oc97 ) , the mechanical power @xmath27 , where @xmath28 myr is the life expectancy of @xmath29 for ob associations , and @xmath30 erg is the individual sn energy .",
    "the mechanical luminosity function of @xmath29 is assumed to be a power - law with index @xmath31 ( oc97 , eq .  1 ) .",
    "if the superbubbles grow until they are confined by the ambient pressure , the standard , adiabatic shell evolution implies that their final radii will be related to @xmath29 as @xmath32 ( oc97 , eq .",
    "the total affected volume is therefore , @xmath33 in contrast , the total mass of metals produced by @xmath26 sne is given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mean yield of metals per sn .",
    "taking @xmath36 , we find that @xmath37 for the superbubble population , showing that the largest superbubbles generate the lowest metallicities , owing to dilution into larger volume .",
    "the mdf for superbubbles is , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the size distribution for objects at their final radii ( oc97 , eq .",
    "the final relation is obtained for @xmath40 , a value typical , perhaps , for all galaxies ( oey & clarke 1998 ) . here",
    "we see that there are larger numbers of metal - rich objects owing to the larger numbers of smaller superbubbles .",
    "finally , the probability density for @xmath4 at any given point in the ism is : @xmath41 for @xmath40 , we obtain , @xmath42 since @xmath3 is a probability density function , its integral must be unity , and @xmath43 gives the appropriate normalization .",
    "thus , for a given generation of star formation , @xmath3 is weighted toward low - metallicity regions because of their large sizes .",
    "the limiting values @xmath44 and @xmath45 are determined by the corresponding @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    for a salpeter ( 1955 )",
    "imf of slope 2.35 and sn progenitor masses between 8 and 120 @xmath48 , we use @xmath49 , based roughly on models by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) . we take @xmath50 pc , a rather arbitrary value corresponding to the characteristic parameter @xmath51 of oc97 ; and @xmath52 pc , corresponding to individual sn remnants . these yield @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 , or , taking o as a tracer of primary elements , minimum and maximum [ o / h ] of 3.0 and 1.3 relative to solar .",
    "the adopted yield of @xmath55 may be somewhat high ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ) , but the mean @xmath3 may be somewhat modified depending on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we can now construct monte carlo models of the mdf for small @xmath2 .",
    "we generate the components @xmath10 by drawing from @xmath3 ( equation  [ fz_pwr ] ) @xmath5 times and summing the drawn @xmath8 ( equation  [ zsum ] ) .",
    "this is repeated 5000 times to obtain distributions for @xmath10 .",
    "equations  [ nz_gen ] and [ ntot_gen ] then provide the instantaneous and total mdfs .",
    "the histograms in figures  [ montecarlo]@xmath19 and @xmath56 show these models of @xmath21 and @xmath23 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and panels @xmath59 and @xmath60 show the same for @xmath61 generations .",
    "the hatched bar in panels @xmath19 and @xmath59 shows the fraction of primordial gas remaining , as determined by @xmath1 .",
    "the analytic curves show the corresponding results from equations  [ nz ] and [ ntot ] . after 2 generations at @xmath58",
    ", we can still see the component power - law distributions in the monte carlo models , and there is gross deviation from the analytic approximation .",
    "however , at only @xmath61 , we can already see how the stochastic model is approaching the analytic version . in panel @xmath62 at @xmath63 ,",
    "the models are in close agreement .",
    "in contrast to this rapid evolution , figure  [ montecarlo]@xmath64 demonstrates the effect of a small @xmath1 .",
    "the model for @xmath65 is similar to that in panel @xmath60 for @xmath66 .",
    "although these are not identical , we can see that it is the product @xmath0 that characterizes the evolutionary state , as a result of equation  [ binomstats ] .",
    "thus , _ the relative filling factor of contamination has the same importance as the number of contaminating generations .",
    "_ while this statement may seem intuitively obvious , it is worth emphasizing , since the implications are profound .",
    "figure  [ halo ] shows data for the outer galactic halo mdf ( laird etal .",
    "1988 ; dash - dot line ) , with [ fe / h ] converted to [ o / h ] following pagel ( 1989 ) .",
    "the solid histogram shows an inhomogeneous monte carlo model for @xmath67 .",
    "there is remarkable similarity between the observations and our rudimentary model , especially in the qualitative shape , having a metal - rich tail and large ( @xmath68 dex ) dispersion .",
    "the data also agree well , coincidentally , with the simple model ( dotted line ; e.g. , tinsley 1980 , equation  4.3 ) for present - day metallicity @xmath69 .",
    "both models take @xmath70 .    however , it is essential to note that _ the shapes of the two models result from entirely different processes_. the high - metallicity turnover in the simple model results purely from consumption of gas into stars .",
    "figure  [ bulge ] shows the galactic bulge , a relatively evolved system , with data from ibata & gilmore ( 1995 ) .",
    "a simple model having @xmath71 requires @xmath72 to resemble the data ( dotted line ) .",
    "the dashed line shows a similar homogeneous model with no gas consumption , i.e. , a linear relation with equal numbers of stars created at all metallicities ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the difference between these two homogeneous models is thus entirely due to the depletion of gas into stars , which also applies to the simple model for the halo ( figure  [ halo ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the high - metallicity tail of the inhomogeneous halo model represents the vestige of the @xmath3 power - law ; while the low - metallicity turnover results from the central limit theorem , as the component distributions progress toward gaussians ( cf .",
    "figure  [ montecarlo ] ) .",
    "this offers an alternative interpretation of the mdf vs. the simple model .",
    "in addition , it reveals the importance of the high - metallicity tail in relatively unevolved systems , for probing the parent distribution @xmath3 .",
    "an evolved inhomogeneous model like the galactic bulge should approach the same limit as the homogeneous simple model , since the metallicities contributed by @xmath3 constitute a progressively smaller fraction of the current @xmath74 of the ism ( edmunds 1975 ) .",
    "figure  [ bulge ] indeed shows that all the models essentially coincide in the low - metallicity tail . however , at the high - metallicity end , the form of the inhomogeneous model mainly reflects @xmath75 for the most recent contaminating generations .",
    "these become progressively narrower ( equation  [ binomstats ] ) , but do not truncate like the simple model .",
    "the inhomogeneous model matches the observed bulge mdf for @xmath76 ; while the simple model would require @xmath77 to be 10 times larger for @xmath70 , with almost half the distribution at @xmath78 [ o / h ] @xmath79 .",
    "thus , it is especially noteworthy that the inhomogeneous model _ agrees with both the galactic halo and bulge mdfs by varying only the single parameter , nq . _ the predicted shape , dispersion , and mean @xmath74 are linked , thus the simultaneous agreement for these features is highly encouraging .",
    "it is also clear that the supersolar mdf is a vital discriminant between the models .",
    "malinie etal .",
    "( 1993 ) emphasize the importance of reproducing not only the low - metallicity tail , but also the high - metallicity drop - off of the mdf .",
    "figure  [ gdwarf ] shows histograms of the empirical galactic disk g - dwarf mdf for stars in solar neighborhood , with [ fe / h ] converted to [ o / h ] as before .",
    "the solid curve shows the analytic inhomogeneous model for @xmath80 ; the dashed line shows a model with a lower yield @xmath81 , which is thereby 10 times more evolved for the given mean metallicity .",
    "finally , the dotted line shows the simple model for @xmath71 .",
    "all models take @xmath82 .",
    "the simple model deviates most strongly from the data , illustrating the `` g - dwarf problem . ''",
    "although the inhomogeneous models do not solve the problem , their mdfs are slightly more peaked , thus more similar to the data .",
    "note also that rocha - pinto & maciel ( 1996 ) truncated their derived distribution below an effective [ o / h ] @xmath83 .",
    "the predicted [ o / h ] fwhm dispersions in the present - day , instantaneous mdf are 0.27 and 0.08 dex for the models with @xmath84 and 320 , respectively .",
    "these values can be compared to the present - day observed dispersion in the solar neighborhood evidenced , for example , by the well - known 0.3 dex deviation of the orion nebula from solar metallicity .",
    "in summary , i present a rudimentary , one - zone model which considers overlapping areas of contamination with no mixing .",
    "this model thus represents a limiting case opposite to the homogeneous simple model .",
    "an under - appreciated point is that the filling factor @xmath1 of contamination is as important as the number of star - forming generations @xmath2 .",
    "the product @xmath0 therefore constitutes a single parameter that describes a system s evolutionary state .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 may be independent , and are roughly associated with the global star formation efficiency and age , respectively .",
    "thus a system with low @xmath1 can result in a present - day metal - poor ism , but having old stars ( e.g. , i  zw  18 ) ; and a high @xmath1 can yield an old , and simultaneously , metal - rich population ( e.g. , the galactic bulge ) . by varying _",
    "only _ the parameter @xmath0 , the model can remarkably match both the galactic halo and bulge metallicity distributions , and slightly improve the disk g - dwarf problem .",
    "as expected , relatively unevolved systems are sensitive to the parent @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the high - metallicity tail of the galactic halo mdf is consistent with a power - law @xmath3 .",
    "however , evolved systems are independent of @xmath3 and show progressively decreasing dispersions .",
    "further development of this inhomogeneous model , and investigation of additional empirical constraints , are currently underway .",
    "i am grateful to cathie clarke , mike fall , and rosie wyse for detailed discussions and suggestions , and also to annette ferguson for early conversations .",
    "i also enjoyed discussions with many people during recent conferences .",
