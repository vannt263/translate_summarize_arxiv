    "physical processes occurring in the environments of groups of galaxies play a fundamental role in determining the star formation history of the universe .",
    "galaxy groups are associated with intermediate mass dark matter haloes ( dmh ) which occupy a pivotal position in the formation of structures , acting as a centre of aggregation of lower mass dmhs and their associated galaxies while being the building blocks for the most massive clusters of galaxies that form at later epochs ( @xcite ) . in the present universe",
    "about 50 percent of all stellar mass is contained within groups of total mass higher than @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the group environment affects the modality in which baryonic gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is being converted into stars .",
    "whereas at early epochs gas fuelling of galaxies is thought to proceed via cold gas accretion in low mass dmhs , this mechanism is predicted to be inhibited by the higher virial temperature of the igm in high mass dmhs hosting galaxy groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , because of the high densities , galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - igm interactions should become effective in removing interstellar gas from galaxies in groups , leading ultimately to a quenching of star formation in the already existing galaxies which have fallen into the groups . on the other hand , these same interactions lead to a chemical enrichment as the igm becomes mixed with the stripped galaxian isms which , potentially , could enhance the cooling of the igm and its ability to accrete onto existing galaxies and to form new star forming systems .",
    "the relative importance of all these processes in determining the star formation activity which is observed to be taking place in groups is an open question .",
    "the stephan s quintet compact group of galaxies ( sq ) presents a natural laboratory with which all these phenomena affecting star formation in groups can be studied . as shown by @xcite ( t05 ) and @xcite ( os9 )",
    ", this group presents a diffuse halo of x - ray emission extending in radius at least as far as @xmath6 with the bulk of the gas radiating at temperatures @xmath7 . assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , this indicates a dark matter halo mass of @xmath8 , intermediate between galaxies and clusters .",
    "the metal abundance of this hot gas is rather poorly constrained , consistent with a primordial and/or galaxian origin .",
    "one galaxy , ngc 7318b , is apparently unbound , entering the group at a high relative velocity of @xmath9 and colliding with the group igm , as evidenced by a @xmath10 north - south long ridge prominent in radio continuum ( @xcite ) , optical line emission ( @xcite ) , x - ray ( @xcite ) and recently also powerful mid - infrared rotational hydrogen lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxies of the group present extended tidal tails that have been used to constrain their recent interaction history ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "potential consequences of these interactions is the presence of an agn in the galaxy ngc 7319 ( @xcite ) and the presence of neutral and molecular gas located mainly outside the galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "uv observations with the galex satellite have provided a detailed picture of the unobscured component of recent star - formation in the group , including the tidal features ( @xcite ) .    in the context of understanding the physical processes controlling star formation in groups in general and in sq in particular",
    "the fir spectral region contains crucial information .",
    "specifically , ir emission from dust is fundamental for an understanding of the amplitude and distribution of star formation since it traces the luminosity of young massive stars highly obscured by their parent molecular clouds at uv and optical wavelengths . the first infrared image of sq , taken by the isocam instrument on board the infrared space observatory revealed the presence of a starburst , sq a , in the igm ( @xcite ) , possibly triggered by the ongoing collision between the intruder galaxy and the igm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the later galex imaging of sq ( @xcite ) also detected sqa in the uv .",
    "overall , the distribution of uv emission in sq measured by galex shows that most of the recent unobscured star formation has preferentially occured in the periphery regions or in the igm .",
    "further evidence for this is the discovery using hst of widespread young star clusters distributed over the tidal debris and surrounding area by @xcite .",
    "it is important to check whether this apparent shift from the main disk of the galaxies ( where most star formation occurs in isolated galaxies , see e.g. @xcite ) is also shown in the obscured component of star formation , and how the pattern of total star formation in the igm is related to the morphological distribution of gas in the different temperature ranges .    a further motivation for studying sq in the infrared are theoretical studies by @xcite and @xcite which have predicted that even small amounts of dust in the hot virialised igm could provide an important cooling mechanism via inelastic gas - grain collisions , with the radiation appearing in the fir .",
    "this has prompted searches for a fir counterpart to the x - ray emitting intracluster medium in several rich clusters ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which however have thus far yielded no unambiguous detection .",
    "this may be attributed to the very low abundance of grains predicted on the basis of realistic estimates of sources and sinks of grains in the igm ( @xcite ) , the expected similarity of the fir colors of the collisionally heated dust emission component with photon - heated diffuse dust in foreground cirrus ( @xcite ) , and the problem of spatial confusion with star forming galaxies in the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "sq is a good object to search for this phenomena since its angular size is small enough for accurate photometric measurements of extended emission and , at the same time , it is possible to separate emission from discrete star - forming sources , such as the constituent galaxies and objects like sq a. finally , the detection of dust fir emission , combined with gas mass measurements to obtain the dust to gas ratio , is a sensitive way of probing the metallicity , and hence the origin , of the various gas components seen in the group in situations where optical nebular line diagnostic are weak or absent .",
    "the most extensive previous study of the fir emission from sq was that by @xcite in the wavelengths range @xmath11 to @xmath12 using the infrared space observatory .",
    "apart from strong detections of the agn galaxy ngc 7319 and the foreground galaxy ngc 7320 , significant detections were obtained in the fir of the intergalactic star formation region sq a and the source sq b located on the tidal feature associated with ngc 7319 .",
    "intriguingly the iso images also hinted at the presence of fir emission associated with the x - ray emitting shock ridge , which was argued to be evidence for collisionally heated dust embedded in the hot shocked gas .",
    "in this paper we present deep imaging of the fir emission from sq taken with the spitzer space telescope .",
    "these data have superior angular resolution and sensitivity compared to the previous iso study and moreover extend the wavelength coverage longwards to @xmath13 , thus providing much deeper investigation of any cold dust components , embracing the expected spectral peak of the emission from photon- and collisional - heated emissions .",
    "the data is used to characterize the pattern of star formation in sq and to investigate possible infrared counterparts of the x - ray emitting structures .",
    "the spitzer observations and data reduction are described in sect .",
    "2 , where we also collate multiwavelength data needed for our analysis . in sect .",
    "3 we described the morphology of the dust emission of sq in relation to the multiwavelength data set and also describe a novel fitting technique to the lower angular resolution fir maps which we use to separate the emission from the main emitting structures .",
    "after extracting photometry from these structures across mir / fir range in sect .",
    "4 , we fit the mir / fir seds with models in sect . 5 to elucidate the mechanisms powering the observed dust emission of the sources in sq .",
    "this information is then used to quantify star formation rates in sect .",
    "6 where we also quantify corresponding gas reservoir available to fuel the star formation . in sect .",
    "7 we quantitatively discuss the nature of star formation in and outside the constituent galaxies of sq , together with the related question of the extent to which collisional heating plays a role in determing the thermodynamic properties of the igm in sq . in this paper",
    ", we assume a distance from the group equal to 94mpc , corresponding to a systemic velocity of @xmath14 and assuming @xmath15 .",
    "in this work we have used spitzer maps from two guest observer ( go ) programs making use of continuum data at @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath13 from the mips instrument @xcite . from the go # 40142 ( pi : appleton , p. ) we took the @xmath18 map and from the go # 3440 ( pi : xu , k. ) the @xmath17 and @xmath19 maps .",
    "in addition , an image of sq at @xmath20 , taken with the irac instrument @xcite and downloaded from the spitzer science center ( ssc ) archive , was also used . in the following we provide details of the data reduction for the spitzer fir maps .",
    "the @xmath18 map has been already presented by @xcite and we refer to that paper for technical details about the data preparation .      the mips @xmath21 and @xmath13 data are from spitzer pipeline version s11.0.2 . in the pipeline default mosaic images ,",
    "there are a few residual instrumental artifacts that are particularly noticeable at @xmath21 .",
    "because of this , these pipeline images were not used in this work . in their place , new images were used in which the instrumental artifacts were reduced by performing additional data reduction steps on the `` basic calibrated data '' ( bcd ) frames .    specifically , for the @xmath21 data , we observed an overall signal drift in time . to remove this ,",
    "we masked out those pixels of each of the 468 non - stim bcd frames that are within a radius of 125 \" of the sq center ( ra=339.0181d , dec=33.969183d ; j2000 ) .",
    "for each bcd frame , a median was calculated from all unmasked pixels .",
    "these medians were plotted as a function of the bcd frame index ( 1 to 468 ) .",
    "the resulting plot shows a clear discontinuity at frame index 313 .",
    "we fit the sections prior to and post this discontinuity separately with a cubic spline function of order 1 or 2 .",
    "the two fitted curves were connected to form one curve covering all the bcd frames . after being normalized by its mean , this curve was divided into the index - ordered bcd frames to remove the signal drift in time .",
    "the next step was to create a sky flat image by median filtering only unmasked data for a given detector pixel .",
    "the resulting sky flat image was normalized by its mean , and subsequently divided into each unmasked bcd frames .",
    "finally , we used spitzer mopex tool to mosaic these improved bcd frames into our final image used in this paper . with a much flatter sky background , our own mosaic image is significantly better than the pipeline counterpart .    for the mips @xmath19 data ,",
    "a similar procedure was used with all 522 non - stim bcd frames . in this case",
    ", the detector signal drifts in time differ significantly among individual readout modules . as a result",
    ", our signal drift removal was attempted on per readout module basis .",
    "background subtraction has been performed by fitting a tilted plane to the maps , after masking a large area covering the main group and , in the case of the @xmath13 map , the galaxy ngc 7320c ( that lies outside the field of view shown in fig .",
    "[ sq_mwave ] ) .",
    "the total area used to estimate the background is about @xmath22 of the entire maps at both wavelengths .",
    "these areas are well outside the group emission , allowing good background measurements .      in this paper",
    "we have also made use of a large set of multiwavelength data to derive physical quantities or for morphological comparison with the emission seen on the infrared maps .",
    "specifically we utilized the sdss maps of sq , obtained from the sdss data archive ( data release 7 ) , the galex fuv map , which have been presented in @xcite , the xmm - newton soft x - ray map from @xcite , the vla @xmath23 line map from @xcite , the @xmath24 maps from @xcite , the irac @xmath25 map , obtained from the ssc archive , and the co radio observations presented in @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ sq_mwave ] ( lower panel ) we show all the spitzer broad bands ( from irac and mips ) where the signal is dominated by dust emission images presented have had the stellar component of the emission subtracted using the relation @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath20 spitzer band also contains emission from rotational hydrogen lines which however we estimate in sect .",

    "these can be compared with the upper panel showing the sdss r - band map , the galex fuv map , the vla radio 21 cm line map and the xmm newton soft x - ray map . on each map",
    ", crosses identify the galaxy centres .",
    "the ir morphology of the galaxies seen in the ir maps is markedly different from the optical morphology .",
    "this is true not only for the early type galaxies but also for the late type galaxies which exhibit remarkably little infrared emission from the main bodies of the galaxies .",
    "the only exception is the emission from the foreground galaxy ngc 7320 which is quite symmetrical in all the spitzer bands , having a filled disk of emission commonly seen in local universe field galaxies , compatible with the optical / uv appearance not showing any sign of interactions ( compatible with its not being a member of sq ) .",
    "the infrared emission from ngc 7319 is dominated by an unresolved nuclear source , presumably from the seyfert 2 agn , that is particularly prominent at @xmath16 and @xmath21 . at @xmath20 one",
    "can also clearly see emission from the disk of the agn host galaxy .",
    "as can be seen from the mir maps , dust emission from compact star formation regions are detected all over the group and especially on the elongated features of the intruder galaxy ngc 7318b which are most prominently delineated in the uv . here",
    "the similarity is strongest between the uv and the @xmath20 band though the most prominent discrete sources are also clearly seen at @xmath16 and @xmath21 .",
    "the most prominent such mir / fir source is sq a , the star formation region located to the north of ngc 7318b , already detected by iso , which can also be seen at @xmath13 . from optical spectra ( @xcite ) and radio observations ( @xcite,@xcite ) it is known that star formation in this region is associated with gas at radial velocities corresponding to both the intruder galaxy and the igm of the group .",
    "several further compact star formation regions are located on the southern arms of ngc 7318b .",
    "the brighter sources , hii se and hii sw , are also detected on the @xmath21 map but not clearly seen on the lower resolution @xmath13 map .",
    "two other bright mir / fir emitting regions detected on the spitzer maps are sq b , a star formation region located on the optical `` young '' tidal tail ( see @xcite ) , and a source , hii n , located about @xmath27 towards the north of the agn galaxy .",
    "there is no clear morphological counterpart in the infrared to the shock region , defined here by the ridge of emission that can be seen on the x - ray map .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath21 map and more particularly the @xmath13 map show enhanced emission towards the peak of the x - ray emission .",
    "the ratio of the mir @xmath28 and @xmath18 emission to the @xmath13 emission at the same position appears rather low compared to the discrete sources associated with star formation such as sq a. a previously undetected feature is an extended fir emission component , spatially coincident with the main part of the group x - ray halo ( as defined in @xcite ) .",
    "the appearance of the corresponding mir emission on the higher resolution @xmath28 and @xmath18 images suggests that the extended fir emission may at least in part be clumpy rather than uniform , possibly indicating the presence of faint star formation regions far away from the centers of the galaxies .    in order to quantify the morphology and brightness of the fir emission seen towards the x - ray emitting halo and shock regions ,",
    "it is necessary to subtract from the fir maps the most prominent discrete sources associated with star formation regions and galaxies . to do this",
    "we devised a fir source fitting technique which we describe in subsection [ map_fit_par ] .",
    "this source fitting technique also serves to fix the photometry and the extent of discrete sources , information that can not be directly extracted from the maps due to the unknown level of mutual confusion .",
    "the fitting technique models a preselected set of the most prominent discrete sources as a sum of elliptical gaussian convolved with the psf .",
    "seven parameters are calculated for each source : amplitude , the peak coordinates , the two gaussian widths , the axis rotation angle and the local background ( included to avoid removal of any diffuse emission components ) .",
    "the fit is performed simultaneously for the 10 brightest sources seen on the @xmath21 maps , ( see fig . [",
    "70mfit ] ) : five compact sources ( sq a , hii se , hii sw , sq b , hii n ) , two sources to fit the emission from the agn galaxy ngc 7319 ( one for the central emission and one for a peripherical star formation region visible after the removal of the first component ) , two for the fit of the foreground galaxy ngc 7320 ( one for the fit of the diffuse emission and one for a compact source ) and one to fit the emission peaked in the middle of the shock region .",
    "the fit to the @xmath21 map is performed first , keeping all the fitting parameters as free variables .",
    "this is followed by a constrained fit to the @xmath13 map in which the relative position of the sources are fixed to the values obtained at @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , a further constraint was that we kept the same shape and axis orientation for the five compact sources , as inferred by the @xmath21 fit , allowing only a size change ( to take into account the potentially more extended distribution of cold dust emission ) .",
    "this strategy was adopted because the higher resolution @xmath21 map places the strongest constraints to the position and morphology of sources in the fir .",
    "we did not use the highest resolution @xmath29 map for this purpose since , whereas the emission detected at @xmath17 and @xmath30 is produced by the same kind of solid dust grains , the emission at 8 @xmath31 is dominated by line emission from pah molecules .",
    "model images from the fitting technique are shown in figs .",
    "[ 70mfit ] and [ 160mfit ] .",
    "the best fit parameters and the inferred total flux densities are shown in table [ fir_sources ] . at both @xmath21 and @xmath13",
    "the best fit model images are remarkably similar to the original maps . on the `` deconvolved '' maps in each figure ,",
    "it is possible to see the contribution from each gaussian to the final map . interestingly enough , the source at the position of the shock is much more predominant at @xmath13 than at @xmath21 , confirming the original impression that the emission in the shock region is brighter at @xmath13 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the position angle of the model source at @xmath13 is aligned with the north - south orientation of the x - ray emitting ridge whereas at @xmath21 no such alignment is apparent . at both @xmath17 and @xmath13 the east - west width of the fitted elliptical gaussians at the shock position ( @xmath32 ) is larger than that of the x - ray shock ridge ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this indicates that the integrated emission is not necessarily entirely composed of emission from the shock ridge .",
    "a full description of the source fitting technique is given in appendix [ ap1 ] .",
    "to understand how the emission peaked in the shock region and the extended emission are distributed on the maps , we created fir residual maps where the emission from all the sources fitted by the fir map fitting technique , with the exception of the source associated with the shock , have been subtracted .",
    "the contours of these fir residual maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ resmaps ] overlaid on hi , x - ray and fuv maps . as one can see , the emission on the fir residual maps is uncorrelated and perhaps even anticorrelated with the hi distribution but well correlated with the soft x - ray flux .",
    "the fir emission , as already seen on the original maps , peaks in the middle of the shock region and its overall extent is similar to the x - ray halo emission ( similar to what was seen in the low excitation pure rotational lines of @xmath34 by @xcite ) . at first sight",
    "this finding supports the idea that collisional heating is producing the observed fir emission .",
    "however a large part of the residual fir emission covers areas emitting significant luminosity at uv wavelengths .",
    "the presence of these radiation sources complicates the interpretation of the dust emission in the shock region as well as for the extended emission ( see sect.[discuss_sec ] ) .",
    "precise photometry of all these different emitting regions in sq is required in order to elucidate the physical mechanisms that power dust emission and the related scientific implications . in the fir",
    "the photometry is derived from the source fitting procedure ( for the discrete sources ) and from the residual maps ( for the shock and the extended emission components ) . in the mir",
    "the high resolution of the mir @xmath28 and @xmath18 maps allows a straightforward extraction of fluxes of the corresponding regions in sq using aperture photometry .",
    "all results are summarized in table [ phot_spitzer ] .",
    "the fir map fitting technique , described previously , allows a precise measure of the flux coming from the compact star formation regions , the agn galaxy ngc 7319 and the foreground galaxy ngc 7320 , all well modelled by convolved elliptical gaussians ( although some sources are not detected at @xmath13 ) .",
    "this technique allowed us not only to obtain the total source fluxes but also to derive accurately the source extent . in fig .",
    "[ cont_deconv ] , as an example , we show the contours of the `` deconvolved '' @xmath21 and @xmath13 emission at the position of sq a overlaid on the @xmath20 and @xmath18 maps .",
    "the fir emission has a mir counterpart that peaks in the areas where fir is higher .",
    "this is generally true for all the fitted fir sources and it validates the use of apertures for the photometry of the compact sources at mir @xmath28 and @xmath18 whose sizes are derived by the fir fitting technique .",
    "specifically , at @xmath28 and @xmath18 we used elliptical apertures having the same axial ratio and orientation as the @xmath21 best fit elliptical gaussian axis and semi - axis lengths equal to @xmath35 ( this area includes @xmath36 of an elliptical gaussian total flux ) .",
    "we took sizes based on the @xmath21 map fit because all the compact sources are clearly seen on that map .",
    "these apertures are depicted in red in figs .",
    "[ aperture8 ] and [ aperture24 ] .",
    "the local background for the aperture photometry has been estimated on regions located nearby the central source , where other peaks of emission are not clearly seen ( see green circles on figs .",
    "[ aperture8 ] and [ aperture24 ] ) . in this way",
    "we are confident that the background level has not been overestimated due to contamination by surrounding sources .",
    "we did nt apply aperture correction for the photometry at @xmath20 because this is close to unity for the chosen apertures ( typical aperture size about 10 pixels ) , as reported by the irac data handbook . at @xmath18",
    "the chosen apertures typically delimit the first outer ring of the psf .",
    "in this case we applied an aperture correction equal to 1.16 ( mips data handbook ) .",
    "for the mir photometry of the galaxies ngc 7319 and ngc 7320 we used large apertures covering most of the emission from these objects and we did nt apply aperture corrections because of the large integration area .",
    "the uncertainties on the mir photometry are given by the quadratic sum of the following contributions : 1 ) error on the aperture correction ; 2 ) flux calibration uncertainty ; 3 ) background fluctuations .",
    "since we used elliptical apertures , instead of typical circular apertures , we rather conservatively assumed that the relative error on the aperture correction is 10% ( note that this error is applied only to aperture photometry at @xmath18 ) .",
    "the flux calibration relative uncertainty is equal to 4% ( irac and mips handbook ) while the error introduced by background fluctuations is derived from the variance of the background mean values in the several areas we selected nearby the sources .",
    "the measured fluxes and uncertainties for both mir and fir wavelengths are given in table [ phot_spitzer ] .",
    "since we are using different methods to derive the source fluxes on the mir maps and the fir maps , it is important to check that these two photometric techniques give consistent results . to verify this , we performed the source fitting technique on convolved mir maps and derived the source fluxes exactly as we did for the fir maps .",
    "details of this test are shown in appendix [ ap1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ ap_vs_fit24 ] we plot the ratio of the @xmath18 fluxes inferred by the fitting technique and by aperture photometry for each source .",
    "for all the sources , except for hii sw , the difference between the fluxes obtained using different methods is less than @xmath37 .",
    "the discrepancy between the fluxes for hii sw arises because of the presence of a compact @xmath18 source at the nearby nucleus of ngc 7318a ) and a compact radio source ( see @xcite ) suggest that this source is a low luminosity agn . ] .",
    "this source is included in footprint of the gaussian returned by the fitting procedure but is outside the integration area used for the aperture photometry .",

    ", one can see that the fir width is significantly larger than the shock ridge width as seen both in the x - ray and radio",
    ". using the current data it is impossible to say if this discrepancy is due to confusion with fainter unrelated infrared sources or to a systematic change in the width of the emitting region of the shock between the x - ray and the fir .",
    "nevertheless we estimated the flux coming from the shock ridge by fitting the fir residual maps with a simple two component model : a psf convolved uniform ridge , used to fit the dust emission in the shock region and whose size ( @xmath39 ) were derived from x - ray data , plus a uniform component . in this procedure the level of the fitted uniform component is influenced by the fact that the actual fir source is more extended than the x - ray source .",
    "taking into account the ambiguity in identifying all the flux from the more extended fir emission with the shock , we have assigned extremely conservative flux uncertainties .",
    "specifically , the upper and lower limits defined by the quoted error bars in table [ phot_spitzer ] are the fluxes contributed by the uniform emission component underlying the solid angle of the shock ridge ( convolved with the psf ) in the cases the uniform emission component has a brightness equal to twice or zero times the value given by the fit .    to measure the mir @xmath28 and @xmath18 emission from the shock region , we simply integrated the emission in the same rectangular area used before to define the shock ridge component in the fit of the fir residual maps .",
    "the adopted apertures are shown in figs .",
    "[ aperture8 ] and [ aperture24 ] . before the integration we masked all the areas inside the apertures we used for the photometry of other sources , because the mir emission in that areas is mainly connected with the corresponding sources that we fitted and subtracted from the fir maps before the measure of the shock region flux . for the fraction of the masked regions that falls inside the shock region integration area we assumed that the surface brightness is equal to the average brightness on the other regions inside the aperture .",
    "the background level has been measured on areas around the rectangular aperture where no peaks of emission are clearly seen .",
    "the quoted error on the integrated fluxes is the sum of the contributions due to background fluctuation and flux calibration error .",
    "we have measured the amount of extended flux on the fir residual maps within a radius of @xmath40 from the shock center , an area approximately equal to that covered by the x - ray halo region as defined in @xcite .",
    "we performed this flux measurement in the following way .",
    "first we constructed radial curves of growth of the integrated emission on the fir residual maps starting from the shock center .",
    "these curves of growth are shown in fig .",
    "[ radial_int_prof ] .",
    "as one can see , the integrated emission continues to grow somewhat beyond the @xmath40 radius .",
    "however we considered only the flux within this limit because it can be directly related to the x - ray halo extent .",
    "we took the curve of growth values for the integrated fluxes at @xmath40 and we subtracted the contribution from the shock region , estimated in sect .",
    "[ shock_phot_par ] .",
    "similarly as before , the uncertainties on the fluxes are mainly due to the mutual contamination between shock ridge and extended emission .",
    "therefore we assumed the same conservative errors that we assigned to the shock region fir fluxes .",
    "for the estimate of the extended mir emission we have used an analogous method .",
    "we constructed radial curves of growth , starting from the shock region center , after having masked all the compact sources and galaxies whose photometry has been described in sect .",
    "[ sfr_phot ] ( note that the shock region is not masked ) . for the calculation of the mir curves of growth we took into account the missing areas ,",
    "those that we masked , assuming that their brightness is equal to the average brightness inside the circular annuli passing through them .",
    "the derived curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ radial_int_prof ] .",
    "exactly as for the fir measurements , we took the value of the curve of growth at @xmath40 and subtracted the emission from the shock region in order to obtain the integrated emission from the extended area corresponding to the x - ray halo .",
    "the flux uncertainties , in this case , are derived summing quadratically background fluctuation , calibration errors and the error on the shock ridge flux .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of dust emission is determined by the heating mechanism , the intensity and color of the radiation fields ( for the case of photon heating ) , the temperature and density of the hot plasma ( for the case of collisional heating ) and by the amount , size distribution and chemical composition of the emitting grains .",
    "ideally one would solve for the distribution of photon sources , hot plasma and grains using a self consistent radiation transfer analysis to fit the entire x - ray / uv / optical - mir / fir sed for each source , analogous to the treatment of photon heated dust in disk galaxies and starburst galaxies ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , due to the extra dimension of collisional heating and the unusual geometry of the optical / uv and infrared emission from sq , this approach would require a very individualized treatment which is well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we therefore adopt here a hybrid approach fitting just the mir / fir sed with superpositions of dust emission templates where each template is appropriate for specific dust emission regions : hii / photodissociation regions ( pdr ) , diffuse photon - powered dust emission , agn torus emission , collisionally heated dust embedded in hot x - ray plasma .",
    "each of these templates is calculated self consistently in terms of physical input parameters , as described in detail in appendix [ sed_temp_mod ] . in this approach the amplitude of the hii / pdr template , derived from the model of @xcite and @xcite and shown in fig .",

    "this value is 20 times smaller than the radio luminosity derived from the radio measurement in xu et al .",
    "03 : @xmath109 . the high radio / infrared luminosity ratio ( which would be higher still with respect to the photon  powered component",
    "if collisional heating was important ) points to the existence of an additional source of relativistic particles in the sq shock , accelerated at the shock itself ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which dominates the population of particles accelerated in sources more directly linked to star formation regions such as supernova remnants .",
    "this confirms and strengthens the preliminary results of @xcite , and , bearing in mind that the total radio emission from sq is dominated by the emission from the shock region , suggests that caution is needed in using radio synchrotron measurements to infer star formation rates in groups involving strong dynamical interactions of galaxies with the igm .",
    "our measurements have shown that both the obscured and visible components of the star formation in sq are distributed in a widespread pattern , loosely coincident both with the overall dimensions of the group as well as with the extended `` halo '' of x - ray emission .",
    "this current morphology of sq star formation can readily be accounted for in terms of the several galaxy  galaxy or galaxy  igm interactions which have occurred in the group . in this standard scenario ,",
    "the gas that is currently converted into stars is interstellar in origin ( as we will discuss later in this section ) .",
    "however , the data are also consistent with a rather different scenario , in which the reservoir of gas out of which stars are being formed is the hot gas phase of the intragroup medium .",
    "specifically we consider a scenario in which the hot intergalactic medium is cooling and condensing into clouds which are the sites of the star formation providing the uv powered component of the extended infrared emission .",
    "if this is occurring in a steady state , in which the rate at which the removal of hot gas by cooling is balanced by accretion of further primordial gas ( that is , we assume that variation in the accretion rate have longer time scales than the cooling time scale ) , we can write @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively denote the mass and cooling timescale of the x - ray emitting medium , and the inequality denotes the fraction of the cooling gas that ultimately condenses into stars . if the observed x - ray emission is the main component of luminosity of the hot medium , and taking observational values for the x - ray emitting plasma from trinchieri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) of @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( see sect .",
    "7.2.2 ) we obtain @xmath115 , comparable to the observed value of @xmath116 for star formation seen towards the x - ray  emitting halo . in reality , however , one would expect a large fraction of the cold gas resulting from the cooling of the gas to be recycled into the hot medium due to the feedback of mechanical energy from the newly  formed stars , in which case @xmath117 would be substantially less the upper limit from eqn.[sfr_hot_eq ] .",
    "thus , if x - ray emission driven by gas  gas collisions is the dominant cooling path for the x - ray halo , one would conclude that the bulk of the star formation would not be directly fuelled out of the igm . on the other hand , as shown in sect.7.2.2 , our spitzer fir data , coupled with astrophysical constraints on the injection rate of grains into the hot medium do not at present rule out the possibility that the dominant cooling mechanism of the halo is fir emission driven by gas",
    " grain collisions . at present , therefore , we can not rule out star formation out of a primordial igm purely on considerations of gas fuelling .    a more powerful constraint would be to consider the efficiency at which such a mode would have to operate at .",
    "unfortunately , the total mass of molecular cold gas , @xmath118 on a global scale in the halo is unknown , preventing a direct empirical measurement of star formation efficiency of the halo on the ks diagram .",
    "one can however estimate @xmath118 under our simple steady state scenario by writing    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the typical time scale spent by the gas in the cold molecular phase before being converted into stars , which is the timescale for the collapse of a molecular clouds to form stars , multiplied by the mean number of times the cold gas is recycled into the hot medium through mechanical feedback before condensing into a star . even allowing for several cooling cycles of the hot gas before condensing into stars ,",
    "the very short collapse timescale of a few million years for molecular clouds - some three orders of magnitude shorter than @xmath112 - makes it likely that @xmath121 , which in turn implies @xmath122 .",
    "if this is the case , the cold gas amount , related to the extended emission , that we should add to @xmath123 would be negligible , and the position of the point for the sq halo on the ks diagram would be well to the left of the relation for star  forming galaxies , as shown in fig .",

    "this would require a more efficient star ",
    "formation process in the igm than is typically observed to occur in the disks of star  forming field galaxies , which would seem to be counter  intuitive to the naive expectation that denser , colder reservoirs of gas closer to the minimum of the gravitational potential wells associated with individual galaxies should form stars more easily . on the other hand a definition of efficiency in terms of gas surface density over scales much larger than the star ",
    "formation regions may have limited predictive power in this context .",
    "furthermore , any star formation in a cooling hot igm would not be expected to occurring in rotationally supported systems similar to the galaxies used to define the ks relation , so may have a different relation to the local gas density .",
    "the second , more conventional scenario to explain the widespread star formation in the extended halo component of sq , is to invoke interstellar gas as the source of cold gas fuelling most of the star formation . in this scenario",
    "tidal interactions between galaxies or hydrodynamical interactions of the ism with the igm remove cold galaxy material that , for sq , produces a similar sfr as would have been the case for a similar amount of gas inside field galaxies . for groups in general the statistical relation of neutral gas observed within and outside the member galaxies to the x - ray emission characteristics of the igm indeed indicates that at least some of the cold gas in the igm medium originates in the galaxies , and that at least some of the x - ray emitting gas also has an interstellar origin ( eg .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more direct evidence of the removal of interstellar gas and dust through galaxy interactions in high density environments is provided by observations of interacting galaxies in clusters , for example through herschel imaging of extraplanar dust emission associated with stripped atomic and molecular gas around the virgo cluster galaxy ngc4438 ( @xcite ) .    in sq ,",
    "there is direct morphological evidence for bursting sources associated with tidally removed interstellar gas in the form of sq a and sq b , and a hint that other less prominent components of the fir emission in the igm may also be associated with tidal features , such as the enhancement of @xmath124 and mir / fir emission seen towards the bridge linking the intruder galaxy with the agn host galaxy . in this picture",
    "the extended emission is a conglomeration of discrete sources similar in nature to sq a and sq b but much more numerous and of lower power .",
    "the fact that sq a and sq b are likely to have a fundamentally interstellar origin despite their present location outside the galaxies is further supported by the rather high value of the dust to gas ratio we have found for these sources , @xmath125 , which is a signature of a high gas metallicity .",
    "the one puzzling aspect of the extension of this scenario to the global star formation in the igm of sq is the lack of prominent star formation associated with the bulk of the hi in the igm located to the south and east of the group .",
    "however , as shown by fig .",
    "5 of @xcite , the gas column density in these clouds ( generally less than @xmath126 ) is rather low compared to the values found for the brightest star formation sites in sq .",
    "therefore it is plausible that star formation is inhibited in these clouds because of the low gas density .",
    "finally , we remark that if stripped neutral and molecular interstellar gas was the only source of cold gas powering star formation , one would expect a rapid quenching of star formation activity in sq in the future , whereas if the star formation were fuelled by a cooling primordial igm , the star formation activity would simply follow the accretion rate onto the group of the primordial igm .",
    "thus , measurement of the uv and mir / fir luminosity functions of well defined statistical samples of galaxy groups , now being defined through deep optical spectroscopical surveys such as the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama ; @xcite ) , may offer a way of quantifying the relative importance of these modes of star formation on the dynamical halo mass of groups in the local universe .",
    "previous searches for infrared emission counterparts of the hot x - ray emitting components of the intergalactic medium of nearby objects have almost exclusively targeted the intracluster medium ( icm ) of rich galaxy clusters , either using a stacking analysis for x - ray or optical selected clusters from the iras all sky survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or in detailed imaging observations of the coma cluster and other clusters with iso or spitzer ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "although intracluster dust has been unambiguously detected at optical wavelengths , through statistical studies of the reddening of background sources through large numbers of clusters ( @xcite ) this has been at a low abundance of about @xmath127 in the dust  to  gas mass ratio , consistent both with the non  detections of the icm in infrared emission and with specific predictions by @xcite of the dust content of typical icms .    in the present work",
    "we have been able to sidestep the confusion problems afflicting the previous attempts to detect infrared emission from the icm in clusters only by virtue of the much higher far  ir brightness levels measured towards the x - ray emitting structures in sq .",
    "these high brightness levels , together with the correspondence of the infrared emission morphologies with those seen in the uv , and the evidence from our fits to the infrared emission seds described in sect .",

    "this , in turn , raises an apparent paradox that the closest spatial correlation between dust emission and gas column density is not , as might be expected for photon heating , with the cool hi and molecular gas component , but rather with the hot x - ray emitting component . in our discussion on star formation in sq",
    "we identified a possible way out of this paradox by postulating that the extragalactic star formation in sq is fuelled by gas from a hot igm , whose cooling is enhanced by grains injected into the hot igm . here , we use the relative levels of detected emission at infrared , x - ray and uv / optical wavelengths to constrain the possible sources of grains and the resulting collisionally driven cooling of the hot plasmas , considering separately the two main x - ray emitting structures corresponding to the shock and the halo regions .",
    "the main constraint on the collisional heating of dust in the x - ray emitting plasma downstream of the shock is given by the high dust  to  gas mass ratio that would be required to reproduce the fir measurements in the case that grain heating by a diffuse radiation field can be neglected .",
    "for pure collisionally heated emission from grains in a homogeneous medium , a dust mass @xmath128 ( see sect .",
    "[ shock_sed_fit_par ] ) would be required , which , taken together with the measured x - ray emitting gas mass , @xmath129 ( see appendix [ ap3 ] ) , would imply a dust  to  gas ratio for the hot plasma of @xmath130 .",

    ", it is evident that the measured dust to gas ratio is much larger than the predicted @xmath153 , and a further source of dust grains would be required if collisional heating were to be a significant driver of the fir emission .",
    "the most obvious such source would be the reservoir of grains in the cold component of the gas in the shock region , which could be potentially released into the hot gas by ablation if the clouds were in relative motion to the hot gas .",
    "as already mentioned the presence of cold gas is implied by the detection of @xmath20 emission and has been directly demonstrated by the detection of molecular hydrogen in the mir rotational lines ( @xcite ) .",

    "the star formation regions in the group are localized at the edges of the galaxies , on tidal features and in the intergalactic medium ; no evidences for star formation have been found towards galaxy centers .",
    "\\2 ) the star formation efficiency for the star formation regions sq - a and sq - b , localized on tidal features , is close to that observed for star formation regions within nearby spiral galaxy disks ( see fig .",
    "[ plot_sfr_sgas ] ) .",
    "star formation in hii - se and hii - sw seems to be much more efficient but the lack of complete gas measurements and the possible contribution to uv radiation from radiative shocks does not allow a definite conclusion for these sources .",
    "\\3 ) the star formation efficiency in the shock region seems to be consistent with the star formation observed in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "however , because of the elongated tidal feature of the intruder galaxy ngc 7318b seen through the shock region , it is not clear if the observed star formation in that area is associated with the shocked gas or not .",
    "the observed radio  ir luminosity ratio is 20 times higher than the value predicted by the radio  infrared relation derived by @xcite , given the observed amount of infrared luminosity .",
    "this reinforces the result obtained by @xcite , suggesting that the acceleration of relativistic particles in the shock region is not associated with star formation .",
    "\\4 ) @xmath219 of the total star formation in sq is associated with the extended fir emission .",
    "the star formation efficiency for this component is rather higher than that observed in spiral galaxies .",
    "this could in principle be due to a new mode of star formation operating in the group and involving cooling of the x - ray halo gas , possibly enhanced by dust  plasma particle collisions .",
    "however the lack of cold gas measurement for this distributed star formation component makes this hyphothesis rather uncertain .",
    "in addition , the evidence of tidal interactions and star formation in tidally displaced cold gas , like sq a or sq b , suggest that the distributed star formation observed in the group is in part occuring out of gas of galaxian origin .",
    "\\5 ) for both the shock region and the extended emission we have measured substantial @xmath20 flux , mainly due to pah molecule line emission and tracer of cold gas phases .",
    "this , together with simple estimates of the dust injection rate across the shock front and in the halo of the group , demonstrates that the mechanism powering most of the dust emission seen on the fir residual maps is not dust collisional heating .",
    "however , given the high fir  x - ray luminosity ratio , the current data do not exclude that the majority of the hot gas cooling can still be due to dust ",
    "plasma particle collisions rather than x - ray emission . for dust in the group halo",
    "we estimated that dust collisional heating can power up to @xmath220 of the dust luminosity .",
    "\\6 ) we have found that the morphology of the fir dust emission in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7319 does not correspond to the cold gas distribution .",
    "therefore , the fir emission in this galaxy does not seem to be related to star formation . given the agn uv luminosity , estimated from the observed hard x - ray flux , and from considerations on the particular torus ",
    "galaxy disk geometry , we deduced that accretion powered radiation from the agn , propagating through the disk of the galaxy , can power most of the observed dust infrared emission .",

    "this is not necessarily true because some sources can , in principle , differ significantly from this simple shape .",

    "the function @xmath399 , describing an elliptical gaussian on a map , is defined by the following formulas : @xmath400 the first two equations define the shape of the elliptical gaussian while the last two are the coordinate transformations between the map and the frame defined by the elliptical gaussian axis .",

    "we have found that the difference on the final results is negligible compared to other sources of error , e.g. only @xmath406 on the inferred source fluxes ) .",
    "the first step of our fitting procedure is to assume a distribution of elliptical gaussian sources , with initial trial values of the parameters , in an array of the same size of the data .",
    "first from a direct inspection of the fir maps and then after some iterations , we identified 10 main sources to be fitted using elliptical gaussians ( see fig .",
    "[ 70mfit ] ) : 2 for ngc 7320 ( one for the disk emission plus one for a compact hii region ) , 1 each for sq a and sq b , 2 for ngc 7319 ( one for the circumnuclear emission plus one for a hii region ) , 1 for a source located north of ngc 7319 ( hii n ) , 2 for ngc 7318b ( the 2 compact hii regions located on the southern spiral arms hii - se and hii - sw ) , 1 for a source peaked in the middle of the shock region .",
    "convolving this array with a theoretical psf , an artificial image is obtained that can be compared with the real data .",
    "varying the parameters of the elliptical gaussians , it is possible to improve the agreement between artificial and real images until a certain degree of accuracy is reached . to minimize @xmath407 and find the best fit model parameters , we used the levemberg  marquardt ( lm ) algorithm ( see @xcite ) , implemented by the idl routine mpfit2dfuncraigm / idl / fitting.html for details on the @xmath41 minimization routine ] .",
    "although this algorithm is less dependent on the initial trial values of the parameters , compared with other @xmath407 minimization methods , the results are inevitably dependent on these .",
    "therefore it is a good rule to assign the initial values as close as possible to the real ones ( or better to which we believe are the real ones ) .",
    "the criteria we used to choose the initial values for the free parameters are the following : + 1 ) amplitude : any number of the order of the peak amplitude of the source ( this fitted parameter has been found almost independent from the initial value ) ; + 2 ) position : initial positions near the peaks of the sources ; + 3 ) gaussian widths : derived approximately from the apparent width of the source ; + 4 ) rotation angle : any number .",
    "+ 5 ) local background : initial value equal to zero .",
    "+ as one can notice , the choice of the initial values does not require to know in advance any parameter but the approximate positions of the source centers and roughly the sizes of the gaussians .",
    "all this information can be easily derived from the data .",
    "the fitting procedure improves the quality of the results ( in the sense that we obtain a smoother fit residual map and a lower reduced @xmath41 ) if we consider only the regions close to the sources for the fit .",
    "we created a mask to exclude all the pixels that are too distant from the calculation , that is more than 2 - 3 times the apparent sizes , from the source centers .",
    "the fitting technique as described until now has been applied successfully to the @xmath21 fir map .",
    "the fitting of the @xmath13 map has been performed in a slightly different way because one can not clearly see on this map all the compact sources that are detected on the @xmath21 .",
    "this effect is most probably due to both lower resolution and intrinsic color differences .",
    "since our goal was to produce consistent seds of the main sources in sq , we introduced new constrains for the fit of the @xmath13 map .",
    "we assumed that the centre position of each source on the @xmath13 map is the same as derived from the 70 @xmath142 map fitting .",
    "we only allowed a common shift of all the source positions in order to correct possible small differences in the astrometry of the two maps .",
    "then we assumed that the orientation angles and the ratio of the elliptical gaussian axial widths @xmath403 for the compact sources ( sq a , hii se , hii sw , sq b , hii n and the hii regions in ngc 7319 and ngc 7320 ) are the same as those inferred from the @xmath21 map fit .",
    "therefore we assumed that the shape of the emitting compact sources is similar at @xmath17 and @xmath13 even if the size can be different .",
    "this is actually expected because colder emission can come from regions that are simply farther away from the central heating source in case of star formation regions",

    "as one can see , this method produces best fit maps with remarkable similarity to the original maps ( @xmath408 , @xmath409 ) .",
    "the `` deconvolved '' map at @xmath21 shows , apart from the emission of the foreground galaxy ngc 7320 and agn galaxy ngc 7319 , many discrete compact sources that are responsible for the several peaks seen on the real map .",

    "dust emission is calculated taking into account the stochastic temperature fluctuations of dust grains following the numerical method described by @xcite , combined with the step wise analytical solution of @xcite .",
    "we created the set of seds by varying the intensity and the color of the radiation field heating the dust and keeping the dust composition fixed .",

    "( 2010 , in preparation ) , using the model presented by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the characteristic of the torus , supposed to be homogeneous , are defined by several parameters : opening angle , external to internal radius ratio , equatorial optical depth at @xmath417 and two parameters , @xmath418 and @xmath419 , that determine the radial and the angular density profile respectively according to the formula @xmath420 , where @xmath421 is the radial coordinate and @xmath422 is the angle between a volume element and the equatorial plane ( note that @xmath423 is determined by the torus optical depth ) .",

    "the extracted sed is the template we used for fitting the agn torus emission and it is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ agn_templ ] .",
    "finally , we needed to model the emission from collisionally heated dust . for this purpose , we used a code , created by j.fischera , based on the works by @xcite and @xcite for calculating the stochastical heating of the dust grains and using the results of @xcite and @xcite to determine the heating rates due to dust  plasma particle collisions .",
    "dust composition is assumed to be a mix of graphite ( @xmath429 ) and silicates ( @xmath430 ) .",
    "pah molecules are not included but , since they have an extremely small destruction time scale when embedded in hot plasmas with @xmath431 , their abundance is expected to be negligible . in order to perform the calculations",
    ", one needs to specify the physical properties of the plasma , i.e. density , temperature and metallicity .",
    "the exact value of metallicity is not important because dust is predominantly heated by collisions with electrons , provided mainly by ionized hydrogen and helium .",
    "plasma temperature and density are derived from x - ray data ( see appendix [ ap3 ] ) .",
    "an important phenomena that should be taken into account while preparing the sed models is dust destruction due to sputtering ( @xcite ) . because the efficiency of sputtering depends on the grain size",
    ", we expect that the size distribution of grains in hot plasmas is different from that of dust in the cold ism , typicall assumed to be @xmath432 with @xmath63 ( @xcite )",
    ". therefore we created a set of seds varying 1 ) the plasma physical parameters ( see table [ xray_dens ] ) and 2 ) the exponent @xmath291 of the size distribution in the range @xmath433 $ ] . a @xmath291 value lower than @xmath434 means that the relative number of big grains is higher compared to the standard size distribution .",
    "since the destruction time scale due to dust sputtering is directly proportional to the grain size ( @xcite ) , a higher relative abundance of big grains is indeed expected in hot plasmas . once the heating rates due to collisions are fixed , a change in @xmath291 modifies the color of the emitted radiation ( see fig .",
    "[ coll_sed_k ] ) .",
    "this happens because big grains are generally colder than small grains , and do not provide warm dust emission due to stochastic heating .",
    "therefore , changing their relative abundance , one can obtain colder or warmer seds .",
    "as we mentioned in [ dust_coll_code ] , the hot plasma physical parameters , needed for the calculation of the emission sed from collisionally heated dust , in both the shock and halo gas , are derived from the x - ray emission .",
    "the temperatures characteristic of the plasma have been obtained by @xcite fitting xmm - netwon x - ray data and quoted in their table 3 .",

    ", we derived @xmath441 by interpolating the cie curve calculated by @xcite at two different metallicities corresponding to @xmath445 and @xmath446 the solar metallicity .",

    "for the shock region plasma we obtained densities in the range @xmath451 .",

    "an upper limit to the dust injection rate from halo stars in sq can be inferred from the halo r - band surface brightness , @xmath462 ( @xcite ) , and using theoretical predictions for the stardust injection .",
