    "the knowledge of the nuclear wave function , in particular its most interesting and poorly known part , _ viz _ the correlated one , is not only a prerequisite for understanding the details of bound hadronic systems , but is becoming at present a necessary ingredient for a correct description of medium and high energy scattering processes off nuclear targets ; these in fact represent a current way of investigating short range effects in nuclei as well as those qcd effects ( e.g. color transparency , hadronization , dense hadronic matter , etc ) which manifest themselves in the nuclear medium .",
    "the necessity to treat nuclear effects in medium and high energy scattering within a realistic many body description , becomes therefore clear .",
    "the problem is not trivial , for one has first to solve the many body problem and then has to find a way to apply it to scattering processes .",
    "the difficulty mainly arises because even if a reliable and manageable many - body description of the ground state is developed , the problem remains of the calculation of the final state . in the case of",
    "_ few - body systems _ , a consistent treatment of initial state correlations ( isc ) and final state interaction ( fsi ) is nowadays possible at low energies by solving the schrdinger equation for the bound and continuum states but , at high energies , the schrdinger approach becomes impractical and other methods have to be employed . in the case of",
    "_ complex nuclei _ , much remains to be done , also in view that the results of very sophisticated calculations ( @xmath3 the variational monte carlo ones @xcite ) , show that the wave function which minimizes the expectation value of the hamiltonian provides a very poor nuclear density ; moreover , the structure of the best trial wave function is so complicated , that its use in the calculation of various processes at intermediate and high energies appears to be not easy task .",
    "it is for this reason that the evaluation of nuclear effects in medium and high energy scattering processes is usually carried out within simplified models of nuclear structure . as a matter of fact ,",
    "initial state correlations ( @xmath4 ) are often introduced by a procedure which has little to recommend itself , namely the expectation value of the transition operator is evaluated with shell model ( sm ) uncorrelated wave functions and the final state two - nucleon sm wave function is replaced by a phenomenological correlated wave function ; to date , a consistent treatment of both isc and fsi in intermediate and high energy scattering off complex nuclei is far from being completed , so that a quantitative and unambiguous evaluation of the role played isc is still lacking .",
    "for such a reason we have undertaken the calculation of the ground - state properties ( energies , densities and momentum distributions ) of complex nuclei within a framework which can be easily generalized to the treatment of various scattering processes , keeping the basic features of isc as predicted by the structure of realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; in section [ sectioncluster ] the cluster expansion method is introduced , and the relevant ground state properties of @xmath5 and @xmath6 calculated . in section [ sectioneep ]",
    "the semi - inclusive @xmath7 reaction off complex nuclei targets is considered , and the fsi is calculated within the glauber and finite formation time pictures , taking advantage of the wave functions obtained in section [ sectioncluster ] . in section [ sectionxsect ]",
    "the total neutron - nucleus cross section is calculated with the same wave functions , and the result of taking into account correlations and inelastic shadowing effects are discussed .",
    "we write the nuclear hamiltonian in the usual form , : [ hamilt ] = + = -^a_i=1 ^ 2_i + _ i < j_2(_i,_j ) , where the vector @xmath8 denotes the set of nucleonic degrees of freedom , and the two - body potential @xmath9 is of the form [ defpotere ] = _ n=1^nv^(n)(r_ij)^(n)_ij , where @xmath10 is the relative distance of nucleons @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , ranging up to @xmath14 , labels the state - dependent operator @xmath15 : [ newuno ] ^(n)_ij=. the evaluation of the expectation value of the nuclear hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) is object of intensive activity which , in the last few years @xcite , has produced considerable results ; nevertheless , the level of complexity of the obtained wave functions is such that they can not be used in scattering problems with reasonable ease .",
