    "the present - day galaxy population has a bimodal color distribution , with a genuine lack of intermediate color galaxies @xcite .",
    "the dearth of green valley objects combined with the increase in passive red galaxies since @xmath3 implies that galaxies quench star formation ( sf ) and rapidly transition from blue to red optical colors @xcite .",
    "the color bimodality is also associated with a morphological bimodality , with early - type ( elliptical ) galaxies exhibiting red colors , and late - type ( spiral ) galaxies exhibiting blue colors .",
    "@xcite suggest that much of the green valley is a byproduct of this bimodality , with most late - type galaxies transitioning to redder colors slowly as their gas supplies are cut off and a minority of galaxies requiring rapid morphological and color transitions from the blue cloud to the red sequence , making the green valley selection alone incapable of definitively identifying morphologically transitioning galaxies .",
    "poststarburst galaxies ( i.e. k+a and e+a ; @xcite ) , the archetypical green valley population , have been identified as morphological transition objects ( ew(h@xmath4 , and a lack of [ o  ii ] and/or h@xmath5 emission lines ) , but these searches select against ionized gas emission lines .",
    "recently , the traditional definition for poststarburst galaxies has been found to be too narrow to encompass the full range of poststarburst transitioning objects @xcite .",
    "@xcite were able to show that while quasars would be rejected from traditional poststarburst searches due to the presence of [ o  ii ] emission , they are indeed a part of the transitioning population of galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that active galactic nucleus ( agn ) outflow host ngc  1266 is also a galaxy transitioning from a star - forming late - type galaxy to an early - type galaxy , and has low ionization nuclear emission line region ( liner)-like emission due to shocks @xcite .",
    "this galaxy would have been missed by traditional poststarburst searches .        _",
    "spitzer _ enabled a detailed study of galaxies in the infrared ( ir ) , and @xcite and @xcite showed that an _ spitzer-_based ir color diagnostic was able to identify the presence of an agn , though there was not an obvious bimodality seen in the original _ spitzer _ work between early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that enhanced wise colors ( @xmath6-[4.6]>0.8 $ ] ) could definitively identify an agn , but this was only sensitive to the brightest agns .",

    "@xcite discovered that galaxies with warm h@xmath7 excesses ( as measured by the h@xmath7/pah flux from the mid - ir ) tended to fall in the ir gap , hypothesizing that shocks heated the h@xmath7 . despite this early evidence that transitions might be occurring in group galaxies , detailed studies searching for a gap in ir colors of morphologically classified galaxies has not been reported .",
    "the comprehensive early- and late - type galaxy samples compiled by @xcite from the galaxy zoo ( @xcite ) were used as the underlying comparison sample . this sample demonstrated how different morphological types manifest in ir color space , and was used to compare to the selected sub - samples described below .",

    "the galaxy zoo sample was then cross - correlated with the wise all - sky catalog @xcite , which successfully matched 47,729 ( 99% ) . a 5  matching radius was used for the @xcite sample , given its local ( @xmath8 ) redshift range , and the likelihood that many of the galaxies are extended in both wise and sdss . in both the following work and @xcite , we use cosmological parameters @xmath9  km  s@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "of the 159,387 elg galaxies , 1,067 were classified as spog candidates , as the spogs criteria create a subsample that is not necessarily shocked . in this paper , we refer to these candidates as spogs * , since ongoing observations are necessary to confirm whether the excitation of the ionized gas is indeed due to shocks ( cales et al .",

    "figure [ fig : wisecmd ] uses the classifications of the galaxy zoo sample to show that , while there is an overlap between the populations in @xmath2 colors , there is very little overlap between the late- and early - type galaxy wise colors , with a [ 4.6][12 ] color gap between * @xmath25 * , demarcated in fig .

    ", a wise color selection seems able to differentiate between galaxy populations and identify objects within the irtz .",
    "while most objects avoid this region , the tails of the galaxy distributions which do begin to inhabit the irtz are either low mass early - type galaxies or high mass late - type galaxies , and it appears that there is very little overlap , unlike the @xmath2 optical colors .",
    "figure [ fig : wisecmd]f includes the @xmath2 vs. [ 4.6][12 ] color diagram , which shows that there is a clear relation between colors .",
    "in fact , it appears that although there is a large spread in @xmath2 colors in late - type galaxies and a larger spread in [ 4.6][12 ] colors in early - type galaxies , the transition zone in both colors is clearly identifiable .",
    "it is likely that this irtz comes from a combination of properties , including the presence of the pah features ( 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7@xmath21 m are in the w3 channel ) , a non - negligible hot dust contribution at 12@xmath21 m ( whereas the emission at 4.6@xmath21 m is still strongly dominated by stars ) , and possibly the contribution of an agn to the ir colors , though the lack of coincident changes in the [ 3.4][4.6 ] colors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wisecmd]c ; @xcite ) seems to indicate that agns are not the dominant contribution . on a larger scale",
    ", this result simply implies that early - type galaxies tend to be ism poor , and late - type galaxies tends to be ism rich , and that the action of losing observational signatures of the ism tend to be rapid . the fact that the tail end of the distribution of massive late type galaxies resides in the irtz suggests that these objects are currently quenching sf .",
    "figure [ fig : spogscmd ] shows the distributions across @xmath2 color - mass space with the galaxy zoo sample ( grayscale ; @xcite ) .",
    "given that the elg sample spans higher redshift and requires non - negligible detections of ionized gas in all lines , the fact that it skews to massive , blue galaxies compared to the galaxy zoo sample is unsurprising .",
    "ew(h@xmath4   galaxies require a large contribution from a - stars , creating a significant overlap between these galaxies and those classed as purely sf .",
    "this means that most balmer absorbers are star - formers .",
    "liners in the elg sample peak toward the red side of the green valley , which could be due to the stringent emission line cutoff we have employed , biasing us toward liners with large ionized gas fluxes , and potentially selecting star formation+agn composites @xcite or shocks . while the majority of liners in this sample are likely early - type galaxies with either low luminosity agns @xcite or post - asymptotic giant branch star contributions @xcite , the fact that the liners in the elg sample are also greener on - average might be evidence that many also exhibit shocks @xcite .",
    "seyferts within the elg sample appear to be massive , with a large presence in the green valley .",
    "given that moderate agn activity has long been known to correlate with galaxies with transitional colors @xcite , the location of the seyferts is unsurprising .",
    "figure [ fig : spogscmd]f shows that spogs * peak at the blue boundary of the green valley , and in a completely different location from the star - forming objects , supporting the idea that this new selection has identified transitioning objects , although the excitation mechanism for the ionized gas in spogs * might not predominantly be shocks .",
    "seyfert contamination could be an issue , though only 18% of spogs * have pure seyfert line diagnostics .",
    "thus , the majority of spogs * are not simply seyferts with poststarburst stellar populations .",
    "future observations focusing on the near - ir h@xmath7 emission ( similar to what was observed in ngc  1275 ; @xcite ) will be able to differentiate between shocks and other excitation mechanisms , giving us the ability to fully understand the spog * population .",
    "figure [ fig : spogswise ] shows the wise ir colors of each subsample , indicating a variety of distributions of ir colors depending on emission line diagnostics .",
    "the elg sample spans the range of wise ir colors , though the distribution is predominantly consistent with the late - type galaxies ( from fig .",
    "[ fig : wisecmd]c ) , as well as the sf and ew(h@xmath16  sources , with a tight locus of points around @xmath6-[4.6]\\approx0.25 $ ] and @xmath26-[12]\\approx3.8 $ ] , as well as blue @xmath2 colors .",
    "@xcite have argued that agn spectra show a flat power law in the ir , and fig .",
    "[ fig : spogswise]b shows that seyferts appear consistent with this interpretation .",
    "while a pure wise color diagnostic is only able to identify the brightest agns , the spread in @xmath6-[4.6]$ ] and [ 4.6][12 ] colors of the seyferts ( compared to late- and early - type galaxies ) is consistent with the contribution of an agn to the ir emission of a galaxy .",
    "seyferts also tend to be found near the edge of the irtz , likely from a combination of the agn ir contribution ( shifting both @xmath6-[4.6]$ ] and @xmath26-[12]$ ] seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spogswise]b ; @xcite ) and transitioning colors ( also evident in @xmath2 from fig .",
    "[ fig : spogscmd]b ) .",
    "wise colors of the liners also show a substantial spread in wise color space , but are more similar to early - types than other objects in the elg sample . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that many liners show strong 11.3@xmath21 m pah features , which need only a small uv field to excite , shifting its color toward the sf cloud .",
    "liner emission from low - luminosity agns could also contribute to the @xmath6-[4.6]$ ] and @xmath26-[12]$ ] colors in many cases , shifting those colors redward .",
    "@xcite also found that in many cases the liners found to be ir - faint also showed supernova remnant - like ir line diagnostics , which are thought to originate from shocks .",
    "liner emission from shocks could also be present in this subsample @xcite .",
    "spogs * appear to be primarily located close to the edge of the irtz than sf - dominant systems ( moreso than liners and seyferts ) .",
    "this could be in part due to the presence of an agn , inferred based on the larger spread in [ 3.4][4.6 ] colors , and in fact , ngc  1266 , the prototypical spog has an influential agn @xcite .",
    "spogs * have green @xmath2 colors , and sf - like [ 4.6][12 ] colors , but sit apart from the sf galaxies .",
    "this @xmath2 [ 4.6][12 ] color combination might imply that spogs * stellar populations are beginning to transition , but could also be influenced by the presence of an agn .",
    "figure [ fig : spogscolors ] shows the @xmath2 vs [ 4.6][12 ] colors with the different line diagnostic classifications overlaid upon the galaxy zoo sample . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : wisecmd]f , the correlation between the colors is tight , and in most cases , the different line classes fall faithfully on the color - color relation , with the sf and balmer absorbed populations sitting prominently in the sf color cloud .",
    "seyferts sit in the color transition zone , without much scatter out of the relation defined by the galaxy zoo sample .",
    "it is possible that these emission detected liners represent a population of galaxies that are completing their optical color transitions , but have not yet completely lost their isms , which could be observed as an enhancement in their 12@xmath21 m emission , while seyferts and spogs * are in earlier stages of the transition .",
    "the nature of the irtz is not yet understood , but we suggest some factors that might create both the tight color - relation between ir and optical as well as the irtz .",
    "the location of the liners and the seyferts seems to indicate that an agn is able to influence the ir color of the host galaxy , migrating all ir colors redward , but the fraction of agns capable of significantly changing their host s ir colors is small @xcite .",
    "the optical colors of objects other than quasars also should not be dominantly affected by the agn @xcite .",
    "the tight optical - ir relation could also be the result of evolution .",
    "in fact , figures [ fig : wisecmd]b and [ fig : wisecmd]e suggest that this is the case , with optical green valley objects lying nearer to the sf portion of the [ 4.6][12 ] color - mass distribution and irtz objects lying closer to the optical red sequence .",
    "this suggests that galaxies transition across optical color space as the sfr begins to diminish , and later completely shed their isms ( likely the dominant constituent of the 12@xmath21 m emission ) , since 12@xmath21 m can be enhanced with a minimal incident radiation field and a modicum of the remaining ism .",
    "more detailed studies of the stellar population ages of galaxies within the irtz are planned , but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the presence of both a tight relation between @xmath2 colors and [ 4.6][12 ] colors , as well as a prominent transition zone , visible in ir and definitive in @xmath2 vs [ 4.6][12 ] , indicates that the addition of wise colors to classifications of galaxies is able to identify transitioning sources through a new classification scheme .",
    "spectrally classed objects , for the most part , fall into the regions of the color space in expected ways .",
    "the position of the transitioning objects in each plot also seem to point to an evolutionary picture , where galaxies transition first in optical colors and then in ir colors .",
    "the spogs * , which are selected to be transitioning objects follow this trend as well , with green @xmath2 colors at the boundary of the green valley , and on the edge of the sf cloud , very near the irtz .    k.a . would like to thank kevin schawinski for giving full access to his early & late - type galaxy sample , as well as theodoros bitsakis and patrick ogle for insightful discussions , michelle cluver and roc cutri for wise advice , and finally the referee for an informative and insightful report that improved the paper .",
