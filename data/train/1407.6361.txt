    "* ) have shown strong x - ray / uv or x - ray / optical correlations on short timescales ( weeks - months ) , with lags close to zero days , but poorer correlations on longer timescales ( months - years ) , usually due to long term uv / optical trends which are not mirrored in the x - ray variability .",
    "these observations suggest that different processes dominate the uv / optical variability on different timescales .",
    "an x - ray / uv correlation on short timescales could result if the uv / optical emission is produced by reprocessing of x - rays by the nearby accretion disc .",
    "the uv / optical would then lag the x - rays by the short light travel time between the x - ray source and the disc . alternatively ,",
    "if the x - ray variations are produced by variations in the uv seed photon flux , produced by accretion variations in the disc at very small radii , then the x - rays should lag the uv - optical by that same short light travel time . thus determining the precise lag between the x - ray and uv - optical emission is a strong diagnostic of the origin of the uv - optical variability .",
    "almost all previous studies , based mainly on a combination of x - ray monitoring with rxte and ground based optical monitoring , show short ( @xmath1  d ) lags of the x - rays by the optical .",
    "however in no individual case is the lag measured well enough to rule out , unambiguously , that the optical might lead .",
    "ground based optical monitoring suffers from interuptions by bad weather but the swift observatory can provide regular simultaneous x - ray , uv ( uvw2 , uvm2 , uvw1 ) and optical ( u , b , v ) monitoring , allowing measurement of wavelength dependent lags    based on swift observations @xcite were able to show b - band lagging the x - rays by less than @xmath2mins in ngc4395 and @xcite , using swift and ground based observations , were able to measure interband lags in ngc2617 which were in good agreement with a reprocessing model .",

    "these observations were largely made as a result of our own proposals but also contain some archival data from other programs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our observations were not scheduled to follow particular flares and so are typical of the long term behaviour of ngc5548 .",
    "this agn is already known to show a strong x - ray / v - band correlation @xcite but the v - band lag has not yet been precisely defined and no simultaneous uv / x - ray monitoring has yet taken place .    in section 2 we discuss the swift observations and lightcurves and in section 3 we discuss the interband correlations and lags on both long and short timescales . in section 4",
    "we compare our lag measurements to those expected from reprocessing from a standard @xcite accretion disc model and in section 5 we discuss the implications of our results for the origin of the variability in the optical , uv and x - ray bands in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the swift x - ray observations are made by the x - ray telescope ( xrt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and uv and optical observations are made by the uv and optical telescope ( uvot , * ? ? ?",
    "the xrt observations were carried out in photon - counting ( pc ) mode and uvot observations were carried out in image mode .",
    "these data were analysed using our own pipeline which is based upon the standard swift analysis tasks as described in @xcite .",
    "x - ray data are corrected for the effects of vignetting and aperture losses and data obtained when the source was located on known bad pixels , or with large flux error ( @xmath3 count s@xmath4 ) are rejected . unless otherwise stated we use the 0.5 - 10 kev x - ray band .",
    "occasional uvot datapoints were seen to lie 15% or more below the local mean , usually as a result of extremely rapid drops .",
    "all such datapoints were examined individually and some were found to be the result of bad tracking and were rejected .",
    "the rest occur when the image falls on particlar areas of the detector , suggesting one or more bad pixels .",
    "all such data were removed .",
    "here we consider the long , well sampled , period from mjd-50000 of 5960 to 6709 although there are a small number of earlier observations .",
    "dates hereafter are in these units .",
    "observations , mostly of 1  ks though sometimes of 2  ks , typically occurred every 2 days although periods of less frequent ( 4d ) or more frequent ( 1d ) sampling occurred .",
    "each observation was usually split into 2 or more individual visits , improving time sampling . in total 554 visits",
    "were made .",
    "after rejection of bad data 465 x - ray measurements remain , with 300 occurring between day 6383 and 6547 .",
    "initially we restricted our uvot observations to uvw2 , following guidelines to reduce filter wheel rotations .",
    "later we relaxed the rotation constraint and additional filters were used .",
    "the uvw2 band was sampled in almost all visits and the resultant x - ray count rate and hardness ratio ( h = 2 - 10 kev ; s = 0.5 - 2 kev ) , and uvw2 flux lightcurves , at the highest available time resolution , are shown in fig  [ fig : lclong ] .",

    "we see a generally close correspondence between the x - ray and uvw2 flux lightcurves as noted previously between the x - ray and v bands by @xcite .",
    "the correspondence on short timescales ( @xmath5d ) is strong but the amplitudes of variability on longer timescales are not always identical , e.g. from day 6470 to 6550 when uvw2 shows a strong upward trend with a much weaker trend in the x - rays . from day",
    "6380 additional observations were made in additional uvot filters and the resultant light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_6band ] .",
    "we see a close correspondence between all uvot bands .",
    "the uvw2 band is the best sampled of the uvot bands and in figs  [ fig : xw2_dcf ] and [ fig : xw2_iccf ] we show the discrete ( dcf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and interpolation ( iccf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ccfs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the complete x - ray and uvw2 datasets from day 5960 to 6710 .",
    "only the more slowly varying uvw2 band is interpolated .",
    "we do not interpolate over the two large gaps but take the weighted mean iccf of the 3 sections seen in fig  [ fig : lclong ] .",
    "the n% confidence levels are defined such that if correlations are performed between the observed uvw2 data and randomly simulated x - ray lightcurves with the same variability properties as the observed data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only ( 100-n)% of the correlations would exceed those levels ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the confidence levels are appropriate to a single trial , ie a search at zero lag , approximately what we are investigating here .",
    "both functions show a broad , but highly significant correlation , peaking near zero lag , with the dcf favouring uvw2 lagging the x - rays by about a day .",
    "ccfs can be distorted when there is a long term variation in the mean level in one light curve which is not present in the other and so it is recommended practice to subtract a running mean @xcite .",
    "we therefore subtracted a mean based on a running boxcar of width 20d from both uvw2 and x - ray light curves .",
    "as 300 of the 465 good x - ray datapoints lie within the intensively sampled period from 6383 to 6547 whose data dominate the measurement of short timescale lags , we concentrate on this period . where @xmath6 visits per day are made . as the separation between visits is not uniform , good sampling of sub - daily variations is provided .",
    "the resulting 20d mean - subtracted uvw2 and x - ray light curves for the intensive period are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensive ] .",
    "we have calculated a variety of dcfs , iccfs and zdcfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : intensive_zdcf ] ) , and all show a uvw2 lag of @xmath7one day .",
    "subtracting a 40d running mean gives a similar result .    to refine the lag measurement we followed @xcite , and the recommendation of @xcite , and calculated the distribution of lags from 10000 simulations for the period day 6383 - 6547 using the javelin cross - correlation program @xcite",
    "we allowed a search range of @xmath8d .",
    "javelin assumes a similar pattern of variability in both bands .",
    "although the x - ray and uvw2 variability properties will be slightly different , the lag measurement should not be noticeably affected @xcite . the resulting lag distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jav ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the median uvw2 lag is + 0.70@xmath9d where the errors are the standard javelin 16% and 84% probability levels . changing the observation period",
    "does not noticeably change the result ; eg for the period 6248 - 6547 the derived lag is + 0.79@xmath10d and if we use the whole dataset from 5960 to 6710 the lag is 0.62@xmath11d .",
    "when applied to the non - mean subtracted light curves , javelin does not converge to the single distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : jav ] but produces a wide , multi - modal , distribution , presumably due to the presence of uncorrelated long timescale variations .",
    "we have also calculated separately the uvw2-hard band and uvw2-soft band lags .",
    "there is no measureable difference .",
    "the x - ray spectral variations of ngc5548 have been studied extensively , e.g. @xcite , with the latter showing absorption variability on different timescales , together with intrinsic luminosity variations . in fig .  [ fig : lclong ] there is a general trend for ngc5548 to become softer with increasing uvw2 and x - ray flux ( as noted by * ? ? ? * ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hard ] we plot hardness ratio vs uvw2 flux .",
    "there is a great deal of scatter in this relationship but the source is generally brighter in the uvw2 band when it is softer .",
    "however the very softest observations occur at the very lowest fluxes .",
    "broadly similar behaviour within the x - ray band is seen by @xcite in ngc1365 .",
    "they explain the spectral variations with a combination of intrinsic luminosity variations and luminosity dependent obscuration in the context of a wind model , similar to @xcite . at the lowest fluxes",
    "only the soft unabsorbed component , scattered from the wind , is visible .",
    "the lack of dependence of x - ray / uvw2 lag on x - ray energy suggests that changing absorption does not change the relative paths taken by the various bands , although it may change the relative amplitudes , and so is not the main cause of the lags .",
    "these spectral variations will be discussed in a future paper ( connolly et al , in prep ) .",
    "all the uvot bands show the same long term trends and so it is not necessary to mean subtract the lightcurves .",
    "we therefore simply use all available data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_6band ] and calculate the lag distributions between uvw2 and the other uvot bands with javelin .",
    "some distributions , such as the example shown ( fig  [ fig : jav ] , right panel ) , are slightly asymmetric .",
    "use of the mode rather than the median would slightly reduce the lags in some cases but the differences are small . the x - ray , w1 and v bands have the best overlap with w2 but we show the lags from all bands .",
    "all uvot bands lag the x - rays with lags which broadly increase with wavelength ( fig .  [",
    "fig : lags ] )",
    ". we can compare the lags with the prediction of reprocessing from a simple accretion disc where the lag should vary as the 4/3 power of wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fitting a simple model of the form @xmath12 , and assuming gaussian distributed errors , we find that @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the fit @xmath16 is 2.1 with 3 d.o.f .",
    "the fit goes straight through the x - ray point so if the lags are measured relative to the x - rays then , unlike @xcite , no additional unphysical offset to the x - ray point is required .",
    "the slope , @xmath17 , is however similar to that derived by @xcite for ngc2617 ( @xmath18 ) , when including a fit offset .",
    "this fit shows that reprocessing of x - ray emission from an accretion disc provides a very good explanation for the short term uv / optical variability in ngc5548 .",
    "to determine whether a disc consistent with other observed properties of ngc5548 can explain the lags we model the disc following the prescription in @xcite ( c.f .",
    "* ) which includes x - ray as well as gravitational heating .",
    "x - ray heating depends on extrapolation of the observed 2 - 10 kev luminosity ( @xmath19 ) to @xmath70.01 - 500  kev , and on the disc albedo . the height , @xmath20 , of the x - ray source above the disc , assuming a lamppost geometry , and the inner disc radius , @xmath21 , are also important parameters .",
    "assuming a black hole mass @xmath22 ( @xmath23 m@xmath24 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , high x - ray heating luminosity corrected for albedo of @xmath27 , implying a low albedo of 20% , @xmath20=6 , consistent with x - ray source sizes measured by other methods @xcite and @xmath21 = 6 , the isco for a schwarzchild black hole , we obtain the dashed line shown in fig .  [ fig : lags ] .",
    "the predicted lags for this standard disc , following impulse x - ray illumination , represent when half of the reprocessed light has been received",
    ". the peak response may be even faster .    to increase the predicted lags to agree with observation , in this homogeneous disc model",
    ", we have to change the geometry ( eg @xmath20=20 , @xmath21 = 20 ) and require a larger @xmath28 m@xmath24 ) and hotter ( @xmath29 ) disc .",
    "increased disc temperature is more important here than disc flaring . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] we compare the model flux distributions for the above parameters as a function of radius in the w2 , w1 and v bands , which are the best sampled , with the radii estimated from the lags .",
    "there is reasonable agreement .",
    "these lags will be modelled in more detail in a future paper ( lira et al , in prep . ) .",
    "_ longer than expected lags : _ although the wavelength - dependent lags in fig .  [ fig : lags ] strongly support reprocessing of x - rays are the major cause of short - timescale uv / optical variability in agn , our observations imply that the reprocessed emission comes from further from the black hole than expected for a ` standard ' accretion disc . by pushing the parameter limits we can reconcile prediction and observation",
    "but we note that @xcite also require a larger than expected disc to explain their microlensing observations .",
    "they suggest a low radiative efficiency , which is consistent with our requirement for @xmath30 .",
    "an alternative solution is provided by @xcite who propose inhomogeneous discs where the outer portions will contribute more flux than for a uniform disc , causing the disc to appear larger .",
    "_ long timescale uvot variability : _ short timescale x - ray / uvw2 correspondence is very good , and also generally good on long timescales , but from day @xmath31 to 6547 the rise in the uv / optical is significantly more pronounced than in x - rays , until @xmath32 when a large x - ray outburst starts .",
    "the uv / optical rise might be associated with an inwardly propagating rise in accretion rate which eventually hits the x - ray emission region .",
    "however unless the ratio of disc scale height to radius is larger than the normally assumed value of 0.1 , or the rise propagates not through the disc but through a corona over the disc , or the perturbation starts at small radius ( @xmath33 ) , the viscous timescales from 100are too long ( @xmath5  years c.f .",
    "_ the relevance of seed photon variations : _ although it is possible , by eye , to suggest periods when the uv - optical might lead on short timescales ( eg day 6150 ) such periods are rare and may just be statistical fluctuations . on average the x - rays lead .",
    "although this observation is simply explained by assuming that all x - ray variability is generated within the corona , one might ask why variations in seed photon flux , where we would expect the uv - optical emission to lead , appear to have little affect on the measured lags .",
    "we suggest that the answer is provided by a combination of relative solid angles and conservation of photons during the x - ray scattering process .",
    "compton scattered x - ray photons have energies 10 - 100@xmath34 greater than the seed photon energy .",
    "as the disc fills a large fraction of half the sky as seen by the x - ray source , a large fraction of the compton scattered photons will hit the disc , out to radii beyond the source of most of the seed photons .",
    "if these photons are absorbed by the disc , leading to black body emission without conservation of photon number , the resultant number of lower energy uv - optical photons produced may exceed the initial seed photon fluctuation . this process could also add a further delay to the optical lightcurves , aiding agreement with observation .",
