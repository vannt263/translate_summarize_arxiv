    "specific frequencies ( @xmath1 ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) in galaxies are observed to be different between galaxies with different hubble morphological types and between those in different environments ( e.g. , harris 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 of globular cluster systems ( gcss ) and their correlations with physical properties of their host galaxies have long been discussed in various different contexts of galaxy formation ; biased gc formation in high - density environments ( e.g. , west 1993 ) , origin of field and cluster elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1992 ; forbes et al .",
    "1997 ) , and origin of dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies ( e.g. , miller et al . 1998 ) .",
    "recent numerical and theoretical studies have also discussed the origin of @xmath1 of elliptical galaxies interacting with cluster environments ( e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "durrell et al .",
    "( 1996 ) investigated the trend between @xmath1 and @xmath3 ( where @xmath3 is the @xmath2-band magnitude of a galaxy ) for galaxies with a wide range of @xmath13 .",
    "they found that @xmath1 values were higher in the lowest luminosity dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , and similar to the @xmath1 values for giant ellipticals ( see fig . 9 in their paper ) .",
    "@xmath14 values appeared to have a minimum at intermediate galaxy luminosities , but there were very few data points available to them .",
    "forbes ( 2005 ) recently investigated the @xmath1 values for @xmath15100 early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster , confirming the high @xmath1 values for dwarfs and low @xmath1 values at @xmath3 @xmath15 19.5 .",
    "thus the @xmath1-@xmath3 relation reveals a ` u'-shaped , or bimodal , distribution .",
    "durrell et al .",
    "( 1996 ) speculated that supernova - driven mass loss was responsible for the higher @xmath14 values in dwarfs .",
    "forbes ( 2005 ) suggested that this , and the transition from hot to cold gas accretion ( dekel & birnboim 2005 ) played a role in determining the number of gcs per unit galaxy starlight .",
    "he further noted that this increase in @xmath1 closely followed the dependence of galaxy @xmath5 with mass .",
    "however , this observed @xmath14 bimodality has not yet been explored by theoretical / numerical studies of gc formation .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to demonstrate , for the first time , whether and how the observed u - shaped @xmath1-@xmath3 relation is reproduced in a `` biased gc formation scenario '' in which gcs can be formed only in galaxy subhalos with high primordial densities and thus virialized earlier ( i.e. , further gc formation is truncated after a redshift of @xmath4 ) .",
    "this biased gc formation scenario has been discussed in the context of gcs properties ( e.g. , west 1993 ; beasley et al .",
    "2002 ; santos 2003 ; bekki 2005 ; yahagi & bekki 2005 ; moore et al . 2005 ) , but not discussed in the context of the u - shaped @xmath1 distribution . throughout this paper , we adopt the standard definition of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total number of gcs in a gcs and @xmath19 is a normalization factor such that @xmath0 has reasonable values ( an order of @xmath20 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed u - shaped @xmath1-@xmath3 relation from harris ( 1991 ) for bright galaxies and from durrell et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for dwarf ones .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the galaxy luminosity dependence of @xmath1 is different between galaxies below and above a threshold luminosity , @xmath21 .",
    "although the dependence is less clear for galaxies with @xmath22 in figure 1 , rhode et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a strong trend of increasing @xmath0 with increasing galaxy luminosity for elliptical galaxies with mass @xmath23 .",
    "the observed @xmath1-@xmath3 and @xmath0-@xmath24 relations may provide vital clues to galaxy and gc formation ( e.g. , harris 1991 ; forbes 2005 ) .",
    "accordingly comparison between observed and simulated relations may well enable us to derive some physical meaning for the relations .",
    "it is therefore important to quantify the relations by using an admittedly simple mathematical expression .",
    "we here propose the following form for the @xmath1-@xmath3 relation ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is @xmath1 at @xmath28 .",
    "parameter values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath21 , and @xmath27 can be determined by fitting to observations .",
    "an example of the model fit with @xmath32 mag , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "this functional form in equation ( 1 ) can be equivalent to @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the @xmath2-band luminosity and other parameter values ( e.g. , @xmath39 ) can be derived from values of the parameters ( e.g. , @xmath29 ) in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the functional form has some advantages in discussing both theoretically and observationally the origin of @xmath1 ( and @xmath0 ) in terms of mass and luminosity growth processes of galaxy assembly .",
    "the observed @xmath40 of @xmath41 in @xmath42 for bright ellipticals ( zepf & ashman 1993 ) suggests that @xmath43 can range from 0 to 1 .",
    "since methods and techniques of numerical simulations of gc formation at high redshifts are given in detail in our previous paper ( yahagi & bekki 2005 , yb ) , we only briefly describe them in this paper .",
    "we simulate the large scale structure of gcs in a @xmath44cdm universe with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 km @xmath48 @xmath49 , and @xmath50 by using the adaptive mesh refinement @xmath51body code developed by yahagi ( 2005 ) and yahagi & yoshii ( 2001 ) .",
    "we use @xmath52 collisionless dark matter ( dm ) particles in a simulation with the box size of @xmath53mpc and a particle mass of @xmath54 .",
    "we start simulations at @xmath55 and follow them until @xmath56 in order to investigate the physical properties of old gcs outside and inside virialized dark matter halos at @xmath56 .",
    "we used the cosmics ( cosmological initial conditions and microwave anisotropy codes ) , which is a package of fortran programs for generating gaussian random initial conditions for nonlinear structure formation simulations ( bertschinger 1995 , 2001 ) .",
    "we assume that ( 1 ) old , metal - poor globular cluster ( mpc ) formation is truncated for @xmath57 , and ( 2 ) initial radial profiles of gcss in virialized subhalos at @xmath58 are the same as those of the `` nfw '' profiles ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ) .",
    "we follow dynamical evolution of gcs from @xmath58 to 0 and thereby investigate mass of the virialized halos at @xmath56 ( @xmath6 ) , the total numbers of gc particles within the halos ( @xmath18 ) , and the normalized number of gcs per halo mass ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "given the fact that there are currently no observational constraints on initial gcs density profiles at @xmath58 , we consider that adopting the nfw profiles is a reasonable first step for better understanding gcs properties in the cdm model .",
    "we convert the simulated @xmath0-@xmath6 relations into the @xmath1-@xmath3 ones by using the following formula : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant and the normalization factor @xmath19 for each model is determined such that number of gcs per unit mass in a simulation box is the same between models with different @xmath4 .",
    "we then compare the simulated relations to the observed data of forbes ( 2005 ) in which the @xmath1 of blue gcs was derived based on new data from the acs virgo cluster survey ( peng et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we investigate two @xmath5 models , i.e. variable and constant @xmath5 . for the variable @xmath5 model , we assume that @xmath9 for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is set to be @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "we here focus mainly on low - luminosity galaxies for which observational data of @xmath1 is available ( forbes 2005 ) .",
    "we accordingly chose the value of @xmath67 consistent with observations based on galaxy luminosity functions ( i.e. @xmath68 ; marinoni & hudson 2002 ) and derive the best value of @xmath69 for low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "although we investigate models with a wide range of @xmath12 ( i.e. @xmath70 ) for the constant @xmath5 model , we only show the results of the model with @xmath71 .",
    "it should be stressed here that all of the present results are galaxies containing gcs at @xmath56 ; gc - less galaxies at @xmath56 ( typically those with @xmath72 ) are not included in the present study .",
    "although forbes ( 2005 ) speculated about a possible @xmath24-dependent @xmath5 explaining the observed @xmath1-@xmath3 relation , his adopted assumptions ( e.g. , constant @xmath0 ) are not based on detailed theoretical / numerical studies . since the present study derives @xmath1 from the simulated @xmath0 , we can discuss more self - consistently the origin of the @xmath1-@xmath3 relation on firm physical basis .",
    "we demonstrate that the simulated @xmath0-@xmath6 dependences are too weak to explain the wide range of @xmath1 for a constant @xmath5 : the difference in gc number per unit galaxy mass between galaxies alone can not explain observations .",
    "figure 2 shows the distributions of the simulated gcss at @xmath56 in the @xmath0-@xmath6 plane for the models with @xmath73 and 15 . below a critical halo mass of @xmath74 , @xmath0 is higher for halos with smaller @xmath6 in the model with @xmath75 . above the critical mass",
    ", @xmath0 is higher for halos with larger @xmath6 in this model and the slope of the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath0 is significantly shallower than in halos below @xmath76 .",
    "this clear bimodality in the @xmath0-@xmath6 relation is not seen in the model with @xmath73 , which shows a monotonically increasing trend of @xmath0 with @xmath6 for @xmath77 .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath0 appears to be significantly larger in halos with smaller @xmath6 for both models , which implies that the observed large dispersion in @xmath1 in low - mass galaxies can be understood in terms of the large dispersion in @xmath0 .    for the model with @xmath75 , gc formation",
    "is assumed to occur only in the subgalactic halos formed from rare high - density peaks in the primordial matter distribution and thus virialized before @xmath78 .",
    "accordingly , the bimodality can be understood in terms of the following two competing effects of halo merging with , or without , gcs .",
    "low - mass subhalos with initially high @xmath0 ( virialized at @xmath79 ) grow after their formation by merging / accretion of subhalos most of which are virialized later than @xmath78 and thus are those without gcs ( referred to as `` gc - less '' halos ) .",
    "consequently , their @xmath0 values can decrease as their masses become larger during hierarchical growth .",
    "_ this is the first effect of halo merging . _    according to the theory of biased galaxy formation ( e.g. , kaiser 1984 ) , the primordial density field of a more massive halo today is more likely to contain a larger fraction of high - density peaks .",
    "accordingly , a larger halo at @xmath56 can be formed from a larger fraction of subhalos that are virialized before @xmath78 and which contain gcs ( `` gc '' halos ) .",
    "therefore , a larger halo is more likely to be formed from merging of a larger fraction of gc halos and thus merging can increase @xmath0 for larger halos .",
    "_ this is the second effect of halo merging .",
    "_    as a result of these two competing effects , we can understand the bimodal @xmath0-@xmath6 relation , i.e. below @xmath63 the first effect is stronger , while above the second effect is stronger .",
    "the dramatic effect of the first gc - less halo merging is not expected for the model with @xmath73 , because most of subgalactic halos that are building blocks of larger halos at @xmath56 have been virialized before @xmath80 and contain gcs .",
    "therefore the monotonically increasing @xmath0-@xmath6 relation is due to the second effect in this model .",
    "it should be stressed here that irrespective of @xmath4 , @xmath0 is more likely to be larger for halos with @xmath7 .",
    "figure 3 shows the comparison between the observations ( forbes 2005 ) and the best variable @xmath5 model with @xmath81 , where @xmath10 is the slope in the relation of @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted here that the observed @xmath1 of blue gcs in ellipticals brighter than @xmath82 mag are seriously underestimated due to the limited acs field - of - view ( forbes 2005 ) .",
    "thus the comparison makes sense only for lower luminosity galaxies . as shown in figure 3",
    ", both models with @xmath73 and @xmath75 can reproduce well the observed trend of increasing @xmath1 with decreasing luminosity for low - mass galaxies with @xmath83 .",
    "figure 4 shows that the simulated @xmath1-@xmath3 relations do not match well with the observations for the constant @xmath5 models .",
    "we also find that constant @xmath12 models , with a wide range of @xmath12 values ( i.e. @xmath70 ) , do not match with the observations either .",
    "these results , combined with those in figure 3 , imply that the origin of the @xmath1-@xmath6 relation is closely associated with the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath6 , as suggested by forbes ( 2005 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows that @xmath1 can be only slightly higher in low - luminosity galaxies with @xmath84 mag as a result of biased gc formation in the model with @xmath75 .",
    "however the simulated dependence is not strong enough to explain quantitatively the observation for the constant @xmath12 model .",
    "since observations for galaxies brighter than @xmath85 mag should be compared with simulations , the results for @xmath86 in figure 2 are relevant to figure 4 .",
    "the derived @xmath1-@xmath3 relations in figure 4 are thus essentially the same as @xmath0-@xmath6 ones for @xmath86 in figure 2 .",
    "if we adopt a higher m / l , the blue / red lines are shifted to the left in figure 4 : a model with m / l = 25 results in a 1 mag shift to lower luminosities .",
    "west ( 1993 ) first suggested that the observed dependence of @xmath1 on galaxy type and environment can be understood in terms of gc formation from the statistical enhancement of rare high - density peaks in the primordial matter distribution ( i.e. , biased gc formation ) .",
    "the present numerical simulations have shown that biased gc formation in subgalactic halos virialized early ( @xmath87 ) , can be imprinted on the observed @xmath88 relation .",
    "semi - analytic galaxy formation models based on a hierarchical clustering scenario have also shown that models with a truncation of gc formation at @xmath89 can better reproduce the observed color bimodality of gcs in early - type galaxies ( beasley et al .",
    "what physical mechanisms are responsible for the truncation ( or the severe suppression ) of gc formation in subgalactic halos virialized at later times ?",
    "santos ( 2003 ) first proposed that cosmic reionization at high @xmath90 can suppress gc formation and thus be an important factor for better understanding the origin of the physical properties of gcss .",
    "recent numerical simulations on gcs and old stellar halos in galaxies have confirmed that structural and kinematical properties of gcss carry fossil information about the epoch of the reionization @xmath91 that can suppress gc formation ( bekki 2005 ; bekki & chiba 2005 ; moore et al .",
    "2005 ; rhode et al .",
    "therefore , if @xmath4 = @xmath91 , the present results imply that the @xmath88 relation can provide some constraints on @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that these relations can be different in different environments ( or cosmic volumes investigated by observations ) , if reionization is spatially inhomogeneous ( benson et al . 2001 ; wyithe & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "we suggest that it is worthwhile for future observations to investigate the @xmath0-@xmath6 relation for a statistically significant number of galaxies , although it is a formidable task to derive total galactic masses including dark matter halos .",
    "such observational studies can test biased gc formation at high redshifts by comparing the results with the corresponding simulations .",
    "the predicted @xmath0 values change only by a factor of @xmath92 for a change in @xmath6 by four orders of magnitude .",
    "the observed difference in @xmath1 for a @xmath3 range of @xmath93 mag ( corresonding roughly to a luminosity difference of factor @xmath94 ) is more than a factor of @xmath95 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore the observed bimodal @xmath1-@xmath3 relation can not be explained well by the present models without resorting a mass - dependent @xmath5 ( for which there is some independent evidence ) .",
    "we accordingly suggest that the origin of the observed u - shaped @xmath1-@xmath3 relation of gcss can be associated , at least partly , with the bimodality in the mass - dependence of the @xmath5 ratio of their host galaxies .",
