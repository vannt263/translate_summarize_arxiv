    "the new field of quantum information has made rapid progresses in recent years .",
    "as relativistic field theory provides not only a more complete theoretical framework but also many experimental setups , relativistic quantum information theory may become an essential theory in the near future , with possible applications to quantum teleportation .",
    "quantum entanglement has already been studied in relativistic frames , inertial or not @xcite .",
    "czachor @xcite studied a version in which an electron is in paramagnetic resonance with relativistic particles , and peres et al demonstrated that the spin of an electron is not covariant under lorentz transformation @xcite .",
    "moreover , alsing and milburn @xcite studied the effect of lorentz transformation on maximally spin - entangled bell states in momentum eigenstates and gingrich and adami @xcite derived a general transformation rule for the spin - momentum entanglement of two qubits . the recent work of alsing and milburn extended the result to a situation where one observer is accelerated @xcite .",
    "fuentes - schuller and mann calculated the entanglement between two free modes as seen by an inertial observer detecting one mode and a uniformly accelerated observer detecting the other mode @xcite .",
    "recently , one of us ( x .- h.g . ) discussed a possible extension to the gravitational field of the quantum teleportation in four dimensional spacetime @xcite .    quantum information theory has not generally been regarded as a theory of spacetime , and entanglement and teleportation has usually been discussed only in four dimensional spacetime . however , if our spacetime is not the usual four dimensional one , the structure of spacetime , in particular , the extra dimensions may still influence the nature of entanglement . in the last decade ,",
    "string theory with an extra space compactified at a larger length scale or lower energy scale than the planck scale has been an attractive idea to solve the gauge hierarchy problem and possibly a candidate for quantum gravity@xcite .",
    "the interest on extra dimensions has escalated from an expectation that in the coming years large hardon collider ( lhc ) at cern may create mini - black holes and thus signal the effects of extra dimensions because of the relevant energy scale@xcite .",
    "even if mini - black holes may be created at lhc , probing the extra dimensions will require a very complicated and delicate analysis of cornucopia of produced particles and their interactions .",
    "as far as extra dimensions are concerned , it would be interesting to think about alternative methods to probe them . as an alternative",
    ", we wondered how extra dimensions might influence , for instance , quantum teleportation by using some newly developed technology . in this paper",
    ", we investigate quantum entanglement and teleportation in a more general situation  in the spacetimes of higher dimensional black holes .",
    "we will show how the extra dimensions and even tev - level gravity would change the properties of entanglement and teleportation , when two observers stay on a 3-brane ( our universe ) , but not in the bulk .",
    "our scheme differs from the standard teleportation protocol in that one observer , alice , stays stationary at an asymptotically flat region of a black hole , while the other observer , bob , moves from the alice s place toward the black hole .",
    "we assume that both alice and bob hold an optical cavity for the measurements of the inside state .",
    "they instantaneously share an entangled bell state at the same initial point in the flat region .",
    "then bob picks his qubit and travels to the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "teleportation can be performed between alice and bob when bob stays at a fixed radius near the event horizon .",
    "however , in contrast with the minkowski spacetime , quantum teleportation in a black hole spacetime requires several points to be clarified such as bob s trajectory and the shape of the cavity in which particles are confined .",
    "it is well known that entanglement states are sensitive to the environment and bob s trajectory may influence his description of the qubit state .",
    "for instance , if bob s cavity is not perfectly insulated , thermal particles from the black hole might flow into the cavity . fortunately ,",
    "if bob approaches the black hole by freely falling , this situation can be avoided , since a geodesic detector sees no particle coming out of the black hole @xcite .",
    "thus , after sharing the initial entangled state , bob may freely fall and then stop freely falling and become stationary at a fixed radius , but to avoid the infinite deceleration due to an instantaneous stop he may slowly decelerate for a while and then become stationary at the fixed radius . during this process the cavity might be teeming with thermal particles , which does not matter seriously , because what is needed is the degree of entanglement and teleportation under this condition .    on the other hand , if the cavity is totally reflecting and does not couple at all to the outside , one can move bob s cavity ( a rectangular box ) adiabatically to near the black hole horizon , which does not introduce any thermal particle of the unruh vacuum inside the cavity .",
    "the boulware vacuum is the ground state for the inside of a box that is stationary in a stationary black hole whose timelike killing vector is used to define the ground state , while the unruh vacuum is the minkowski vacuum that has thermal particles relative to the boulware vacuum and can be detected by an accelerated observer @xcite .",
    "unruh and wald discussed about mining energy from a black hole by lowering an originally empty box to a black hole sufficiently slowly , opening up the box and letting the surrounding unruh thermal radiation flow into the box @xcite .",
    "they also found that during this process , if one does not open the box , then the interior of the box will remain in the vacuum state with respect to its local time coordinate .",
    "the reason is that the boundaries of the box that both move with an acceleration effectively remove the horizon from consideration and thereby keep the field inside the closed box in the vacuum state .    of course , even for a well - insulated and reflecting cavity , one can not screen gravity and an initial vacuum state inside the cavity might evolve into thermal unruh states because of gravitational coupling between the inside of the cavity and the outside .",
    "we estimate a possible coupling time for a boulware vacuum inside a cavity , which perfectly reflects non - gravitational fields , to become approximately thermal due to gravitational effects . for a thick wall cavity outside a solar mass black hole",
    ", the coupling time is larger than the age of our universe , which implies that the gravitational coupling effect is negligible .",
    "note that this works under the condition that the size of the cavity is much smaller compared to the curvature of the black hole .",
    "otherwise , the cavity can not act as it were in a thermal bath that is equilibrium with the black hole . for a mini - black hole that may be created at lhc with typical horizon curvature @xmath0",
    ", it is hard to make a thick wall box ( say , of the size @xmath1 ) near the horizon in thermal equilibrium . and",
    "also , the coupling between the inside and the outside will diverge if one takes an infinitely thin box and couples the inside with the outside across a tiny distance .",
    "now our situation is that what we put into bob s cavity initially is not a pure state but a state entangled with a particle inside alice s cavity .",
    "this entanglement will be maintained by any evolution of the cavity as long as the cavity remains totally reflecting and decoupled from any outside system . in this case , the entanglement between bob s particle and alice s particle will survive and perfect teleportation is still possible .",
    "this process works well for teleportation outside massive black holes , but for mini - black holes , especially those short - lived black holes that may be created at lhc , it is impossible to lower bob s cavity slowly to approach black hole horizons .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate possible influences that extra dimensions might impose on the entanglement and teleportation in curved spacetimes .",
    "so we do not discuss the situation , in which both cavities evolve adiabatically , because this makes no distinctions between teleportation in a curved spacetime and that in a flat spacetime .",
    "contrarily , we consider the situation , in which bob freely falls , then slow downs for a finite period of time and stops freely falling and becomes stationary at a fixed radius .",
    "then , measurements of teleportation can be performed between alice and bob .",
    "the results show that in a higher dimensional black hole spacetime the degree of entanglement and the fidelity of teleportation is closely related to the extra dimensions , the mode frequency , the mass and the angular momentum per unit mass of the back hole .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we study quantum entanglement and teleportation in a higher dimensional schwarzschild black hole spacetime . after reviewing a basic feature of quantum field theory in this curved spacetime",
    ", we estimate the gravitational coupling time for states inside and outside the cavity and then go directly to the discussion of entanglement and teleportation . in sec .",
    "iii , we extend our discussion to a rotating black hole spacetime .",
    "the discussion applies not only to scalar particles but also to gauge bosons and dirac particles .",
    "finally , we discuss the effects of the extra dimensions , mode - frequency and black hole parameters on fidelity of quantum teleportation in sec . iv .",
    "we first review some essential feature of quantum field theory in a higher dimensional schwarzschild black hole , which is relevant to quantum entanglement .",
    "it is the global structure of a black hole spacetime that plays an important role in understanding hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "it has also been known that the vacuum of a nonstationary curved spacetime is in general not equivalent to the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the event horizon of a black hole causally disconnects the exterior region from the interior one .",
    "the global spacetime structure of a uniformly accelerated observer consists of two rindler wedges : one is causally disconnected from the other by the future and past horizons . thus the accelerated observer detects a thermal spectrum while moving through the minkowski vacuum , the so - called unruh effect @xcite .",
    "the spacetime near the event horizon of a schwarzschild black hole approximately looks like the rindler spacetime , which provides the hawking radiation with an interpretation of the unruh effect . observing that the causally disconnected region surrounded by horizons provides a fictitious system to an outside observer , israel @xcite applied thermofield dynamics @xcite to the rindler wedge or black holes to explain their thermal nature ( see also @xcite ) .    in the following ,",
    "we use the two - photon state of the electromagnetic field , which may be modeled by a massless scalar field , where the polarization is ignored @xcite .",
    "the metric of a @xmath2-dimensional schwarzschild spacetime is given by @xcite @xmath3dt^2 + \\left[1- \\bigl(\\frac{r_{h}}{r } \\bigr)^{d-3}\\right]^{-1}dr^2+r^2d\\omega^2_{d-2 } , \\label{schw}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the event horizon with the area @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the volume of a unit @xmath7-sphere .",

    "the particle states are defined by positive frequency modes or wave packets with respect to timelike killing vectors .",
    "note that the metric ( [ schw ] ) has a future - directed killing vector @xmath20 in @xmath21 and @xmath22 in @xmath23 of fig .",

    "thus the vacuum ( [ vac ] ) and its excited states are mixed states of outgoing particles in @xmath63 .",
    "for an observer outside the black hole , quantum unitarity is lost because he would not be able to do any measurement in @xmath64 .",
    "as @xmath64 is no longer accessible to him , he can only make an average over the states in @xmath64 to obtain the density operator in @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , the measurement of an operator @xmath66 in @xmath21 is the trace of @xmath66 weighted with the thermal operator @xmath67 , ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "one can simplify the analysis by considering the effect of teleportation of the target state @xmath69 by the minkowski observer alice to a single schwarzschild mode of the observer bob .",
    "thus , one can only consider the mode @xmath25 in region i which is distinct from the negative mode in the same region @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that both alice s and bob s cavities are designed to detect particles , so we neglect the antiparticle modes in their cavities in the hereafter discussions .",
    "therefore , the single - mode component of the minkowski vacuum state , namely the two - mode squeezed state , is given by @xmath70 and , similarly , the excited state by @xmath71      we now discuss how alice and bob come to share an entangled resource for teleportation .",
    "after the coincidence of alice and bob , alice remains at the asymptotical flat region , while bob slowly lowers himself and his cavity to the vicinity of the black hole horizon . as noted previously , we assume the inside of bob s cavity is totally decoupled from the outside .",
    "thus , when the cavity is lowered to a fixed radius outside the horizon and becomes stationary , the entanglement between bob s particle and alice s particle will be exactly maintained . in this case , perfect entanglement and teleportation is possible and for massive black holes , this protocol works well .",
    "however , a puzzle might be raised that nobody can screen gravity , so there would be some gravitational coupling between the inside and the outside of the cavity , even if the cavity is well - insulated and reflecting all non - gravitational fields .",
    "hence , the boulware vacuum inside the cavity that is perfectly insulated from non - gravitational fields from the outside , might couple gravitationally to the outside and evolve into approximately the unruh thermal state .",
    "we estimate the coupling time for the inside to become approximately thermal through the gravitational interaction .",
    "let us consider a thick - wall box ( for example , the thickness of the bottom wall is @xmath72 ) , which is dropped very near the horizon of a schwarzschild black hole , and the mass of the black hole is assumed to be of order of a solar mass ( @xmath73 ) and thus the black hole temperature is about @xmath74 .",
    "the size of the cavity must be much smaller than that of a black hole , otherwise it can not maintain thermal equilibrium with the hawking radiation .",
    "now no fields are confined to this rectangular box with an inside volume @xmath75 .",
    "then , the cavity outside the horizon will respond as though it were in thermal bath of temperature @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the redshift factor defined by @xmath78 .",
    "the energy density of thermal radiation is given by the stefan - boltzmann law @xmath79 we assume that after a time interval @xmath80 , the box will be teeming with thermal flux . hence , from an infinity observer viewpoint , a graviton with energy @xmath81 , crossing the thick walls of the cavity obey the following equation @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the surface gravity of the black hole and @xmath84 .",
    "we then have @xmath85 a clock inside the cavity will become slower since the cavity filled with a thermal radiation is heavier than before .",
    "thus the change of the clock running from eq .",
    "( [ graviton ] ) is @xmath86 according to the uncertainty principle , the uncertainty of time is attributed to the change of energy inside the cavity , that is , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we find that @xmath89 the results show that in our case @xmath90 , which is longer than the present age of our universe ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "therefore , the gravitational coupling between the inside and the outside of the cavity is negligible .",
    "for mini - black holes , the above estimation about gravitational coupling time does not work in that it is difficult to define a thick - wall cavity surrounded by a thermal bath near the black hole horizon .",
    "therefore , for massive black holes , bob can slowly lower his cavity down to the black hole horizon and the state inside the cavity will evolve adiabatically .",
    "since gravitation coupling is negligible , perfect entanglement and teleportation is still possible for observers with a well insulated cavity outside a black hole .",
    "however , for mini - black holes , it is technically difficult to consider a very thin cavity to perform teleportation without losing information .    as emphasized in sec .",
    "i , in this paper , we focus on the condition that bob can freely fall toward the black hole and then stop through a slow acceleration on a surface outside the event horizon , and bob s cavity evolves not totally adiabatically and becomes full of thermal radiation near the black hole horizon .",
    "then the state inside bob",
    "s cavity is no longer perfect entangled with that of alice .",
    "one can assume that prior to their coincidence , alice and bob have no photons in their cavities .",
    "suppose that each cavity supports two orthogonal modes , with the same frequency , labeled @xmath92 and @xmath93 with @xmath94 , which are each excited to a single photon fock state at the coincidence point .",
    "the state held by alice and bob is then the entangled bell state @xmath95 where the first qubit in each term refers to alice s cavity with index @xmath96 , the second qubit to bob s cavity with index @xmath97 .",
    "the bell state is a maximally entangled state in inertial frames .",
    "if bob undergoes a uniform acceleration or stays in curved space - time , the state in his cavity must be specified in rindler or schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "as a consequence , the second state in each term of ( [ bell ] ) should have a schwarzschild mode expansion given by ( [ zero ] ) and ( [ one ] ) .",
    "we can then rewrite eq .",
    "( [ bell ] ) in terms of minkowski modes for alice and schwarzschild modes for bob .",
    "since bob is causally disconnected from region @xmath23 , we must trace over the states in this region , which results in a mixed state @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "the partial transpose of the density operator @xmath100 can be obtained by interchanging alice s qubits as @xmath101 and the corresponding negative eigenvalue of the partial transpose is given by @xmath102 the degree of entanglement for the two observers here can be measured by using the the concept of logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic negativity is defined as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the negativity of the state .",
    "the negativity is defined as the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose with respect to @xmath105 .",
    "so @xmath106 the entanglement monotone is found to be @xmath107 at @xmath108 , corresponding to @xmath109 , we are back to the usual case of entanglement between alice and bob where both are minkowski observers , and there are no schwarzschild modes in bob s cavity ( i.e. @xmath110 ) .",
    "and thus @xmath111 . for a finite acceleration",
    "the entanglement is degraded . in the limit @xmath112 ,",
    "the second term in ( [ negativity ] ) is vanishing .",
    "the logarithmic negativity is then @xmath113 .",
    "figure 2 shows that for a finite surface gravity , the degree of entanglement is reduced .",
    "figure 3 shows that if the black hole mass @xmath114 is fixed , the logarithmic negativity is reduced as the extra dimension number @xmath115 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath115 is fixed , @xmath116 is enhanced as @xmath114 increases .    the states @xmath117 , @xmath118 are defined in terms of the physical fock states for alice s cavity by the dual - rail basis states as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and the similar expressions for bob s cavity .",
    "in order to teleport the unknown state @xmath121 to bob , we should assume that alice has an additional cavity , which contains a single qubit with dual - rail encoding by a photon excitation of a two - mode incoming ( minkowski ) vacuum state .",
    "this will allow alice to perform a joint measurement on the two orthogonal modes of each cavity .",
    "after alice s measurement , bob s photon will be projected according to the measurement outcome .",
    "the final state bob received can be given by @xmath122 , where there are four possible conditional state amplitudes expressed as @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . once receiving alice s results of measurement , bob can apply a unitary transformation to verify the protocol in his local frame .",
    "however , bob must be confronted with the fact that his cavity will become teemed with thermally excited photons because of the hawking effect .",
    "when alice sends the result of her measurement to bob , the state he observes must be traced out over region @xmath23 , since rob is causally disconnected from region @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath125\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\left.\\times \\vert m , n - m \\rangle_{i } \\langle m , n - m \\vert   + ( x_{ij}y^{*}_{ij } \\tanh^{2n}r\\right   .",

    "suppose upon receiving the result @xmath129 of alice s measurement , bob can apply the rotation operators restricted to the 1-excitation sector of his state .",
    "in this way , we may define the fidelity corresponding to the teleportation as @xmath130 which is identical with the results of alsing and milburn . from fig .",
    "4 , we can see that the fidelity of teleportation depends on the extra dimension number and horizon radius .",
    "we notice that the hawking radiation emitted by larger four dimensional , astrophysical black holes has not yet been observed because for a black hole with several solar mass @xmath131 , the characteristic temperature is about @xmath132k : an extremely low temperature corresponding to a very low energy frequency that can not be detected .",
    "the primordial black holes that would have been created at the early universe with possible mass ( @xmath133gr ) and the corresponding hawking spectrum with a peak in the range @xmath134 have not been detected either .    in recent years",
    ", it is proposed that in brane - world theories the true scale @xmath135 of quantum gravity may be lower than the traditional planck scale @xmath136 , possibly approaching tev scales @xcite .",
    "the observed weakness of gravity at long distances is due to the presence of @xmath115 new spatial dimensions large compared to the electroweak scale .",
    "this follows that @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the size of the extra dimensions . a black hole with horizon radius @xmath4 smaller than the size of extra dimensions @xmath138 , would submerge into extra dimensions , and for a given mass @xmath114 such a black hole becomes lighter , larger and colder than a usual four dimensional black hole with the same mass .",
    "if we assume that @xmath139 , which implies that @xmath140 and , choose the black hole mass @xmath141 , the ratio between the @xmath142-dimensional schwarzschild horizon radius and the ordinary 4-dimensional schwarzschild with the same mass @xmath143 is given by @xcite @xmath144for @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 and then @xmath147 .",
    "so for a given mode frequency @xmath148 , the tev - level gravity enhances the entanglement monotone and teleportation fidelity greatly .",
    "but for a mini - black hole that may be created at lhc with emitted hawking radiation frequency range @xmath149 , the logarithmic negativity for entanglement is then bounded to @xmath150 and the teleportation saturates to @xmath151 .",

    "figure 6 shows that if we fix the angular momentum parameter @xmath166 and vary the mass @xmath165 ( or the horizon radius ) , the logarithmic negativity increases as the mass ( or the horizon radius ) increases . if we fix the black hole mass and vary the angular momentum parameter @xmath166 , the logarithmic negativity increases with @xmath169 , but the correction of entanglement monotone is small due to the different value of @xmath169 .",
    "this is different from a 4-dimensional kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if we keep the mass and the angular momentum parameter @xmath169 fixed , but vary the extra dimensions of spacetime , the logarithmic negativity is reduced as @xmath115 increases .",

    "( [ roe ] ) , we can see that when the surface gravity @xmath41 approaches infinity , the logarithmic negativity saturates to @xmath208 ( see fig . 8) .",
    "we now turn to teleportation between alice and bob and utilize dual rail basis states as an excitation of a spin - up state in one of two possible spatial modes in alice s cavity and similarly for bob . upon receiving alice measurement results , bob trace over region @xmath23 of the state he observes and obtains @xcite , @xmath209",
    "the fidelity of bob s final state is then @xmath210 in the fermionic case , the number of allowed excitations is bounded above by @xmath145 .",

    "figure 10 demonstrates the fidelity of teleportation as a function of both the mode frequency and black hole surface gravity . for a mini - black hole that may be created at the lhc with emitted hawking radiation frequency range @xmath212 , the logarithmic negativity for entanglement",
    "is then bounded to @xmath213 and the teleportation saturates to @xmath214 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated quantum entanglement and teleportation in the spacetime of higher dimensional schwarzschild and kerr black holes .",
    "the teleportation protocols in the black hole spacetime are discussed in detail . for massive black holes and well - insulated cavities , which can reflect all non - gravitational fields ,",
    "it is possible for an observer with his cavity to lower the cavity slowly down to the black hole horizon , and perfect entanglement and teleportation can be realized since the gravitational coupling is negligible .",
    "however , for mini - black holes , we prefer to let one observer ( bob ) fall freely , then slow down and stop to become stationary at a fixed radius . actually , it is hard to believe that we can keep a thick wall cavity near a mini - black hole horizon in thermal equilibrium with the hawking radiation .",
    "if we want the the cavity to be in thermal equilibrium , the wall of the cavity should be very thin ( compared to the size of the horizon curvature ) and a thin wall cavity could not prevent outside non - gravitational fields from leaking into the cavity .",
    "we have discussed a possible new physics that may arise from the presence of extra dimensions and the unbounded angular momentum parameter @xmath169 . it is found that if the gravity is really at tev scales , the reduction of entanglement monotone and teleportation fidelity is not so drastic as that in planck scale gravity theory for mini - black holes .",
    "we can use quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation experiments to detect extra dimensions .",
    "for instance , for a mini - black hole created at lhc , quantum entanglement experiments can be conducted near this black hole .",
    "if this black hole is a higher dimensional one , the reduction of entanglement monotone is not so drastic as that of an ordinary 4-dimensional one .",
    "the reduction of entanglement monotone can be described as a function of extra dimensions .",
    "if we fix other parameters , then the degree of entanglement decreases as the number of extra dimensions increases .",
    "the degree of entanglement is found to be degraded with increasing the extra dimensions . for a finite black hole surface gravity ,",
    "the observer may choose higher frequency mode to keep high level entanglement .",
    "the fidelity of quantum teleportation is also reduced because of the hawking - unruh effect .",
    "we have discussed the fidelity as a function of the extra dimensions , mode frequency , mass and/or angular momentum parameter of black hole for both bosonic and fermionic resources . for quantum entanglement and teleportation with bosonic particles ,",
    "all the correlations might be lost for the observers in gravitational fields and the fidelity could be degraded to zero , but for fermionic cases , the entanglement monotone and teleportation fidelity are bounded to @xmath215 and @xmath216 , respectively , because of the pauli exclusion principle .",
