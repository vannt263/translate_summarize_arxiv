    "we would like to contribute to the understanding of the qcc for _ open _ systems with _ mixed _ chaotic motion ,",
    "in particular we consider particle motion in two - dimensional ( 2d ) billiards whose phase space is characterized by incomplete ( smale ) horse - shoes .",
    "as is well known , 2d billiards are popular models of ballistic mesoscopic systems @xcite and microwave cavities @xcite .",
    "+ usually and naturally , qcc is explored by means of semiclassical calculations @xcite .",
    "unfortunatelly , this approach poses limitations since semiclassical quantities involve the cumbersome determination of the action associated with the trajectories and sums which often do not converge .",
    "however , as baranger and co - workers @xcite have found through their semiclassical calculations of conductance , the dominant contributions to the average quantum conductance are classical .",
    "this motivates us to construct purely classical counterparts of the scattering probability ( sp ) matrix @xmath0 and husimi distributions for 2d open billiards . in a previous paper @xcite we showed",
    "that knowledge of the classical counterpart of the sp matrix enables us to predict the global structure of the quantum sp matrix .",
    "here we further our study , specializing to the case of mixed chaotic motion , by : 1 ) analyzing in more detail the type of trajectories responsible for the formation of certain structures in the classical and quantum sp matrices ; 2 ) comparing husimi distributions with classical phase space structures ; and 3 ) identifying certain purely quantum effects in the behaviour of the conductance . +",

    "iii the 2d waveguide model is presented , as well as its resulting quantum and classical sp matrices for a large number of modes .",

    "some aspects of the qcc are studied in section v in terms of husimi distributions and their classical counterparts , the _ transient poincar maps_. the appearance of purely quantum effects in our system is analyzed in section vi and in sect .",

    "hence @xmath20 .",
    "+ note that with this notation the @xmath7 matrix and the incoming and outgoing wave vectors take the form    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the transmission and reflection @xmath26 matrices .",
    "@xmath27 is the highest mode ( the largest @xmath28 beyond which the longitudinal wave vector @xmath29 becomes complex ) .",

    "+ we now explain the procedure to construct the purely classical counterpart of @xmath56 . consider a classical particle entering the cavity of the waveguide , say , from the left lead and making an angle @xmath57 within a range corresponding to a given mode @xmath28 . the particle ( ray )",
    "will generally collide with the walls of the cavity of the waveguide a few times before exiting the cavity either to the left or to the right lead , making a certain angle @xmath58 to which we can associate a mode @xmath42 if @xmath59 . to specify the initial conditions for the trajectory of the i-_th _ particle , the initial position @xmath60 and the initial angle @xmath57 must be given . in order to account for all possible types of trajectories ,",
    "we take a large number ( typically @xmath61 ) of initial positions for each incoming angle @xmath57 . by recording the number of particles scattered into the various ranges of @xmath62 associated with different outgoing modes",
    "@xmath63 , we obtain a distribution of outgoing modes for each incoming mode @xmath28 . this distribution gives the _ classical counterpart _ of the matrix elements @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the quantum sp matrix . similarly , to obtain the classical counterpart of @xmath66 and @xmath67 we repeat the above process but for particles entering from the right lead .",
    "this defines the procedure for constructing the _ classical sp matrix_. +",
    "we chose the geometry of the cavity of the waveguide to be that of the  rippled \" billiard , which consists of two hard walls : a rippled wall modulated by a periodic function @xmath68 [ @xmath69 , and a flat wall at @xmath70 ; @xmath71 is the width of the waveguide and @xmath72 the modulation parameter .",
    "for concretenes , the periodic function in this paper is given by @xmath73 .",

    "1 shows the geometry for a two - period rippled cavity .",
    "+ this _ finite _ length version of the rippled billiard , a model of a quantum or electromagnetic waveguide , has been used to study certain transport manifestations of chaos in the classical @xcite and quantum @xcite regimes .",
    "moreover , studies of the _ infinitely _ long ( periodic with no leads ) rippled billiard , originally introduced to model beam acceleration problems @xcite , has also provided insight in the understanding of general features of periodic structures ( e. g. , energy band structure , structure of eigenfunctions , etc . ) and has been utilized to explore the problem of quantum - classical correspondence of classically chaotic systems @xcite . + before analyzing our scattering system ( cavity connected to leads ) it is instructive to look at the dynamics of the infinitely long periodic ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath75 mod .",
    "@xmath74 ) billiard .",
    "a poincar map ( pm ) of the system supplies us with the dynamical panorama .",
    "we choose the poincar surface of section ( pss ) as the bottom boundary , @xmath70 and the pm is generated by the iteration of the birkhoff pair of variables @xmath76 , labeling the longitudinal component of the position and the angle the total momentum of the particle makes with the @xmath75-axis right after its @xmath77 collision with the bottom wall .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that the motion can be either regular , mixed , or fully chaotic depending on the relationship between the geometrical parameters @xmath78 . a representative picture of a mixed phase space ( obtained with the set of parameters @xmath79 ) is shown in fig .",
    "+ in this work , we analyze the waveguide system defined by a cavity formed by a _",
    "single _ period of the rippled billiard [ with the same values @xmath78 used in fig .",
    "2 ] attached to two aligned semi - infinite leads each of width @xmath71 .",
    "the period one and period four resonance island structure of fig .",
    "2 is formed by trapped orbits within the region @xmath80 .",
    "in particular the central resonance is formed by trajectories colliding nearly perpendicular with the walls in the neighbourhood of @xmath81 , the widest part of the cavity .",
    "since the left ( right ) lead is attached to the cavity at @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , such island structure is also present in the waveguide system .",
    "note that the orbits forming these islands are classically not accesible to scattering trajectories .",
    "+ in figures 3 and 4 we present , respectively , the quantum and classical sp matrix for the _ one - period _ waveguide with @xmath84 open channels .",
    "the quantum sp matrix was calculated by the recursive green s function method @xcite , and the classical sp matrix by the procedure described above with @xmath85 ensambles ( each characterized by a different @xmath57 ) of @xmath61 different initial conditions . note the rich structure present mainly in the transmission part ( @xmath64 and @xmath66 ) of the sp matrix .",
    "we note that @xmath86 and @xmath87 , as expected from the symmetry of the system .",
    "+ the similarity between quantum and classical sp matrices is remarkable in the case of a large number of modes ( here @xmath84 ) , suggesting that the motion belongs to the deep semiclassical regime .",
    "nevertheles , we have also seen a resemblance between the quantum and classical sp matrices even for a number of modes as low as 10 .",
    "hence the calculation of the classical sp matrix as a tool for prediction becomes relevant in quantum regimes .",
    "first we focus on the transmission part of the classical sp matrix which is presented in fig .",
    "5 , this time as a function of angles .",
    "the first clear and interesting structure to analyze is in the region @xmath88 , for which an enlargement is made in fig 6 .",
    "the existence of _ whispering gallery orbits _ ( wgo ) is well known in cavities with concave walls .",
    "these are guided orbits along the inner surface of such cavities , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "note that our cavity has a concave part in @xmath89 . in recent works",
    ", it has been shown that wgos produce self - similar structures @xcite . here",
    "we can see that a self - similar structure also shows up in the spm , in particular in the transmission part of the classical spm ( fig .",
    "+ we find that the structure of fig .",
    "6 is formed by trajectories that hit only on the concave part of the _ upper _ boundary before being transmitted : the outer part of the structure ( @xmath90 ) is due to trajectories that hit it only once ; the second generation ( @xmath91 $ ] ) is due to trajectories that hit it twice , the next generation ( @xmath92 $ ] ) to trajectories that hit the boundary three times , and so on . the point of convergence of the self - similar structure ( not shown in fig .",
    "5 due to numerical lack of resolution ) is @xmath93 , the angle at the inflection point of the profile ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "a particle that would hit the upper boundary at @xmath94 with @xmath95 would hit the concave part of the billiard an infinite number of times before leaving it at an angle @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "7 whispering gallery trajectories selected from different generations of the structure of fig . 6 are shown .",
    "+ similarly , we can discover the types of particle motion that produce the various structures in the transmission part of the classical sp matrix .",
    "8 shows typical trajectories that contribute to the zones marked in fig .",
    "all these orbits are very stable : small variations of the initial conditions @xmath97 follow closely the same trajectory , with the same number of collisions with the upper and lower boundaries and with very similar final angles @xmath58 . noting that the marix elements @xmath0 gives a measure of the number of trajectories connecting a pair of angles @xmath98",
    ", then for _ every high intensity structure in the classical sp matrix there corresponds a boundle of stable trajectories_. moreover , since all the high intensity structures present in the classical sp matrix are also present in its quantum counterpart we can expect the stable orbits of the underlying classical motion to play the dominant role in determining quantum transport properties .",
    "a complementary tool to analyze a waveguide system is the _ transient poincar map _ ( tpm ) which has the same meaning as the poincar map ( pm ) but now taken for the scattering system in the range of interaction .",
    "the tpm ( with surface of section at @xmath70 ) is presented in fig .",
    "9a shows the part of the tpm generated by trajectories whose initial conditions start in the left lead only and fig .",
    "9b shows the contribution of trajectories starting from both , right and left leads .",
    "comparison of fig .",
    "9b with fig .",
    "2 shows , as expected , that the stability regions present in the pm for the infinite billiard become forbidden phase space regions in the tpm .",
    "+ now we can ask about the location in the tpm of the whispering gallery orbits ( wgo ) . for this purpose",
    "we construct the tpm choosing now as surface of section the _ top _ boundary because , as explained in sect .",
    "iv , the wgos are guided orbits along the concave part of the boundary .",
    "the upper tpm is constructed by the pairs @xmath99 corresponding , respectively , to the longitudinal component of the position and the angle made by the total momentum with the tangent of the boundary at @xmath100 , right after the @xmath77 collision with the upper wall .",
    "the location of the wgo in the tpm is shown ( highlighted ) in fig .",
    "10 , where the numbers label the number of collisions the particles make with the upper boundary .",
    "a structure of this type in phace space formed by wgos has been reported in @xcite .",
    "we see that this pattern evolves from top to bottom ; the higher the number of collisions with the upper wall , the closer the angle @xmath101 is to zero . in the limit @xmath102",
    ", a particle will collide an infinite number of times along the concave part of the boundary .",
    "+ a popular tool used to explore quantum - classical correspondence in billiards is the husimi distribution @xcite ; it is the projection of a given quantum state onto a coherent state of minimum uncertainty .",
    "the husimi distribution can be viewed as a quantum phase space probability density that can be directly compared with the classical phase space .",
    "see @xcite for details of the calculation of the husimi distributions for the infinetly periodic rippled billiard . here",
    ", for our waveguide system we calculate the husimi distributions for each one of the @xmath28 opened modes at certain fermi energy and compare them with the tpm generated solely by trajectories starting with the corresponding @xmath103 .",
    "then , using a fermi energy that supports 20 modes we present in figures 11a-11d the tpm s generated by particles entering from the left lead with angles corresponding to the @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 mode , together with the corresponding husimi distributions .",
    "note that husimi distributions coincide with the regions of phase space with the largest density of points .",
    "this agreement suggests that the tpm can be a used to predict , at last qualitatively , the husimi distributions .",
    "recently , ketzmerick and co - workers @xcite obtained important results concerning the transport properties of waveguides which classically produce fully chaotic or mixed dynamics .",
    "specifically , they showed that the behavior of the landauer conductance @xmath108 ( given by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 are the transmission elements of the @xmath7 matrix ) and the wigner delay time can clearly distinguish between full and mixed chaos .",
    "see also @xcite . in our geometry , this distinction is exemplified in fig .",
    "12 where we contrast the dimensionless conductance @xmath108 , in a range of energy that supports @xmath111 modes , for the cases of mixed ( fig . 12a ) and globally chaotic dynamics ( fig .",
    "for the mixed case we used the same geometrical parameters as before [ @xmath112 and for the globally chaotic case we use @xmath113 .",
    "the difference is clear : while for mixed dynamics the conductance @xmath108 fluctuates strongly with sharp resonances , for global chaos it is a smooth function of energy .",
    "these wild fluctuations in the mixed chaos case are due to the existence of resonance and hierarchical states , as argued in @xcite .",
    "+ so far we have seen that the similarity between the classical sp matrix and its quantum counterpart enabled us to understand various quantum features in terms of purely classical dynamics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have also seen a nice agreement between the tpm and its quantum counterpart , the husimi distributions .",
    "the energies for which such a good agreement occurs were chosen at random . however , if we select now an energy value corresponding to a sharp dip or peak in the conductance ( mixed case ) we find substancial differences between the classical and quantum quantities .",
    "as an example , in fig .",
    "13 we plot the same modes as in fig .",
    "11 but with an energy corresponding to a typical dip in the conductance , see inset of fig . 12 .",
    "note that in contrast with fig .",
    "11 the husimis lie predominantly on classically forbidden regions of phase space .",
    "in particular , for this energy they have their support on the four - period resonance .",
    "the culprit of this phenomenom is heisenberg s uncertainty principle that allows the wavefunction to tunnel through the kam barriers . + it is also instructive to look at the wavefunctions in configuration space for the non - resonant and resonant cases , see fig",
    "the plots on the left ( right ) of this figure correspond to the non - resonant ( resonant ) case .",
    "the non - resonant ( resonant ) energy is the same as that used in fig . 11 ( fig . 13 ) for modes 2 , 5 and 20 .",
    "these plots reveal a striking difference . in the resonant case",
    "we notice a `` bow - tie '' pattern which shadows the classical trajectory of a particle in a four - period periodic orbit , corresponding to the four islands in the tpm . as mentioned above , the phase space region of the period four islands is not accessible to _ classical _ particle incoming from the right or left leads ; only trajectories originated in the interior of the cavity can be trapped and form this pattern .",
    "it is precisely this bow - tie pattern that has been exploited experimentally in @xcite for the construction of high gain microlasers with directional emission with _ closed _ resonators of high refractive index .",
    "we see that such a pattern can be obtained also for _ open _ cavities because quantum mechanically the wavefunction , due to heisenberg s uncertainty , can penetrate into the classically forbidben areas .",
    "thus , as we have proposed in @xcite , directional emission microlasers may also be constructed with open cavities .",
    "we have also computed `` classical wavefunctions '' for these type of cavities , constructed basically in the same way as the tpm with a box - counting method to mimic intensity in configuration space @xcite .",
    "the classical wavefuntions that we obtained look very much like the truly quantum wave functions for the non - resonant case except for interference patterns . of course , the classical wavefunctions do not reproduce the resonance structure as this is a purely quantum effect .",
    "the objective of this work has been to contribute to the understanding of the classical - quantum correspondence as regards scattering in open billiards which serve as models of mesoscopic electron waveguides as well as microwave cavities .",
    "here we make a comparative analysis betweeen the scattering probability ( sp ) matrix and the husimi distributions with their classical counterparts , namely the classical sp matrix and the transient poincar maps ( tpm ) , respectively . as a paradigm of open billiards ,",
    "we use a model of a ballistic 2d waveguide formed by a rippled cavity attached to two colinear leads .",
    "the classical particle motion in such cavity is known to undergo the generic ( hamiltonian ) transition to chaos @xcite . for the purpose of this work ,",
    "the parameters of the cavity were chosen to produce mixed chaos ( a ternary incomplete horshoe @xcite ) .",
    "+ we find a very good global similarity between classical and quantum sp matrices and , as expected , this similarity is greater as the number of open modes in the quantum system increases .",
    "however , even for a moderate number of modes ( @xmath114 ) the similarity between classical and quantum sp matrices allows to extract important information about general as well as individual features of the quantum system .",
    "in particular , all high intensity patterns in the classical sp matrix , found to be produced by bundles of stable trajectories , appear also in the quantum sp matrix .",
    "hence , knowledge of the structure of the _ classical _ sp matrix allows us to predict which incoming modes contribute dominantly to transmission or reflection in the quantum system @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that certain self - similar structure in the transmission part of the classical sp matrix is due to whispering gallery orbits ( wgo ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , important differences are revealed for energy values corresponding to sharp peaks or dips in the conductance .",
    "for these resonance energies , the wavefunctions tunnel ( thanks to heisenberg s uncertainty principle ) into forbidden classical phase space regions ( resonance islands ) , associated with stable periodic orbits within the cavity .",
    "+ similarly , the husimi distributions and the tpm show an excellent agreement in the case of non - resonant energies .",
    "the agreement suggests the usefulness of the tpm as a tool to predict the support of husimi distributions for each open mode in the system .",
    "also , we have seen for a certain resonant energy , where substantial differences between tpm and husimi distributions occur , the wavefunctions of the system form a bow - tie pattern .",
    "we have exploited this phenomenom to propose the construction of microlaser resonators in open cavities @xcite .",
