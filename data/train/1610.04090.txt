    "the asymptotically sharp scaling is given by @xmath9 .",
    "we believe that this curious result is a good indicator that this sequence might have all sorts of other nice properties and could be of some interest . a natural question would be whether anything can be said about the location of local maxima : it is tempting to conjecture that they can not be too well approximated by rationals with small denominators ( because that s where the minima are ) .    at ( 0,0 ) ; ( -3,-2 )  ( 3,-2 ) ; ( -3,-2.1 )  ( -3,-1.9 ) ; at ( -3 , -2.4 ) @xmath10 ; ( 3,-2.1 )  ( 3,-1.9 ) ; at ( 3 , -2.4 ) @xmath11 ;    at ( 0,0 ) ; ( -3,-2 )  ( 3,-2 ) ; ( -3,-2.1 )  ( -3,-1.9 ) ; at ( -3 , -2.4 ) @xmath12 ; ( 3,-2.1 )  ( 3,-1.9 ) ; at ( 3 , -2.4 ) @xmath13 ;    both definition of the function as well as its graph are reminiscent of the takagi function @xmath14 , which is a continuous but nowhere differentiable function that was first considered by takagi @xcite in 1901 ( with independent re - discoveries by van der waerden @xcite in 1930 and de rham @xcite in 1957 ) : if @xmath15 denotes the distance from @xmath16 to the nearest integer , then @xmath14 is given by @xmath17 @xmath18 has since appeared in connection to inequalities for digit sums @xcite , the riemann hypothesis @xcite and extremal combinatorics @xcite ( many more results can be found in the surveys @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize a 1959 result of kahane @xcite who proved that the set of local minima are exactly the dyadic rational numbers .    at ( 0,0 ) ; ( -3,-2 )  ( 3,-2 ) ; ( -3,-2.1 )  ( -3,-1.9 ) ; at ( -3 , -2.4 ) @xmath19 ; ( 3,-2.1 )  ( 3,-1.9 ) ; at ( 3 , -2.4 ) @xmath20 ;    at ( 0,0 ) ; ( -3,-2 )  ( 3,-2 ) ; ( -3,-2.1 )  ( -3,-1.9 ) ; at ( -3 , -2.4 ) @xmath11 ; ( 3,-2.1 )  ( 3,-1.9 ) ; at ( 3 , -2.4 ) @xmath21 ;",
    "we observe that for @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 here , @xmath25 denotes the signum function @xmath26 let us now consider the function in @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "we have @xmath29 we analyze these two coefficients and show that the first one is bounded ( the second term is clearly unbounded ) .",
    "the function @xmath30 has period @xmath31 and the map @xmath32 is a permutation on @xmath33 .",
    "it is then easy to see that the symmetries of sine and cosine imply @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",
    "the periodicity and @xmath32 being a permutation give @xmath36 while , at the same time , we obviously have @xmath37 from which positivity follows for @xmath38 .",
    "+      the main argument only appealed to certain fairly elementary symmetry properties of the trigonometric functions and easily extends to various other functions .",
    "a particularly nice example comes from replacing the sine by the cosine @xmath43 whether @xmath44 is the location of a local minimum or maximum now depends on the parity of @xmath45 .",
    "what other phenomena can be found ?"
