    "e.g. _ ultra - fast dna sequencing  @xcite and many biological processes  @xcite .",
    "most of the computational research on forced translocation , where the polymer is driven through a nanoscale pore by a potential , has dealt with fairly weak pore potential or force and assumed close - to - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "recently , hydrodynamics has been shown to significantly affect forced translocation for experimentally and biologically relevant force magnitudes  @xcite .",
    "the pore geometry has been noted to have effect on the experimental translocation process ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the effect of the pore model has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , the significance of the pore model in the forced polymer translocation has not yet been determined .",
    "we have recently made a comparison of the unforced and forced translocation  @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the process was seen to be close to equilibrium , as expected , and accordingly its dynamics turned out to be robust against variations in the computational model .",
    "however , in the second case the observed out - of - equilibrium characteristics for biologically and experimentally relevant pore force magnitudes , made the dynamics more sensitive to differences in the computational models  @xcite . accordingly",
    ", we expect the pore model to play a significant role in the forced translocation case  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have consistently used a cylindrical pore implemented by a potential symmetrical around the pore axis  @xcite . however , this differs from the typical pore implementation where the pore is formed by removing one particle from a wall consisting a monolayer of immobile , point - like particles  @xcite .",
    "a notable difference is that the latter pore implementation results in a driving potential that is inhomogeneous in the direction of the pore axis . in the case of lattice boltzmann simulations",
    "these bead - pore models include both the square  @xcite , and cylindrically  @xcite shaped pores . typically ,",
    "the pore - polymer interaction is solely repulsive but the effect of attractive interaction has been investigated in a 2d model  @xcite .    in order to investigate how susceptible translocation dynamics is to variations in the pore model we have implemented in our computational translocation model also the bead pore used in  @xcite .",
    "we compare translocation processes for the bead pore and our original cylindrical pore .",
    "the model dependency is expected to be strongest in the pore region under strong forcing .",
    "we also try to evaluate the effect of the pore model for moderate forcing .    when the force bias inside the pore is small , the velocities involved are small enough for the hydrodynamics to be neglected  @xcite , and the langevin dynamics ( ld ) is a valid choice for the computational model .",
    "assuming that the polymer remains close to equilibrium throughout the translocation , the control parameter may be defined as the ratio of the total external force and the solvent friction , @xmath0 as done by luo et al . in  @xcite .",
    "then the translocation dynamics would depend only on @xmath1 .",
    "they reported this to be the case even for a long polymer chain driven through the pore with a significant value of total pore force @xmath2 .",
    "the scaling of the average translocation time with respect to the chain length , @xmath3 would then be determined solely by @xmath1 .",
    "this is in clear contradiction with our earlier observation that the scaling exponent @xmath4 increases with the force due to crowding of the monomers on the _ trans _ side  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the effect of the pore model along with other model - dependent factors would in this case be negligible  @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath4 with force can not hold asymptotically as pointed out in  @xcite , since ultimately very long polymers would translocate faster with a smaller pore force . from fig .",
    "1  b ) in  @xcite it can be evaluated that this unphysical condition would be seen for @xmath5 for the pore force magnitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is comparable to actual dna lengths of @xmath8 that are far beyond polymer lengths of @xmath9 used in simulations .",
    "the translocation dynamics then would have to be different for @xmath10 , which is in keeping with our earlier qualitative description of the forced translocation  @xcite .",
    "the polymers were seen to be driven out of equilibrium throughout the translocation already for modest pore force magnitudes .",
    "the continually increasing drag force on the _ cis _ and crowding on the _ trans _ side were seen to change the force - balance condition , which is directly reflected on the translocation dynamics .",
    "this force balance is sure to be different for very long polymers .",
    "the suggested control parameter @xmath1 , if applicable , would imply that the forced translocation could be completely characterized through varying it , which again is in stark contrast to our observation that the forced translocation is a non - universal , out - of - equilibrium process for biologically relevant magnitudes of pore force  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to determine if this contradiction arises from using different pore models",

    "the pore , aligned with the @xmath20-axis , is of diameter @xmath31 and length @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the kuhn length of the model polymer , and @xmath34 is either @xmath6 or @xmath35 .",
    "the pore is implemented by a cylindrically symmetric damped harmonic potential that pulls the beads toward the pore axis passing through the middle of the pore in the @xmath20-direction .",

    "an octagonal composition of eight immobile particles was used as the bead pore model , as depicted in fig .",

    "the effective pore length is approximately @xmath39 , so @xmath40 . unlike in our model , in  @xcite",
    "also the wall was made of immobile particles .",

    "these effects are , however , mitigated by the fact that @xmath34 averaged over translocation time is constant .",
    "correspondence between computational and physical length scale can be established by taking the polymer bond length @xmath39 as the kuhn length for the physical polymer . in si units",

    "( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "the transition time profiles for the bead pore are qualitatively similar with those obtained for the cylindrical pore with different parameters  @xcite .    from the different scaling of the translocation times obtained for large and small pore force magnitudes and the different average state transition times",
    "we conclude that @xmath1 which was kept fixed can not be a universal control parameter for forced translocation regardless of the pore model .",
    "this is in keeping with our previous finding that the forced translocation is a highly out - of - equilibriun , non - universal process for the biologically and experimentally relevant pore force range  @xcite .",
    "originally , the need to compare the cylindrical and bead pore models arose from the differences in the scaling of the translocation time @xmath41 with the polymer length @xmath51 in forced translocation obtained using these two pore models .",
    "the translocation times averaged over at least @xmath118 and at most @xmath119 runs are shown in fig .  [ model_scaling ]  ( a ) as functions of @xmath51 .",

    "three values , @xmath120 , @xmath35 , and @xmath121 , are used .",
    "for the two separate pore models we find clear differences in both the absolute value of @xmath41 and its apparent scaling .",
    "regardless of the value for @xmath26 , we obtain a smaller scaling exponent @xmath4 for the cylindrical than for the bead pore .",
    "in addition , increasing @xmath26 from @xmath120 to @xmath121 increases @xmath4 for both pore models , see inset in fig .  [ model_scaling ]  ( b ) .",
    "this in part explains the different results obtained with the two pores as the effective friction experienced by a chain is different inside them .",
    "this difference is naturally enhanced at higher velocities .",
    "our previous results were obtained with the polymer bead mass @xmath122 due to the requirement of the stochastic rotation dynamics that the polymer beads should be heavier than solvent beads  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we checked how the bead mass affects the characteristics of the translocation time . increasing the bead mass from @xmath6 to @xmath123",
    "is seen not only to increase the average translocation time @xmath41 but also to change its apparent scaling with polymer length @xmath3 , see fig .  [ model_scaling ]  ( a ) . to be certain , we checked this using two independent langevin algorithms .    in accordance with our previous findings for cylindrical pore",
    ", @xmath4 was seen to increase with pore force also for the bead pore . for @xmath124 , the scaling exponent @xmath125 ( fig .  [ model_scaling ]  ( b ) ) , @xmath126 ( fig .  [ control_parameter ]  ( a ) ) , @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "[ model_scaling ]  ( a ) ) , and @xmath128 ( not shown ) were obtained , respectively .",
    "surprisingly , for the cylindrical pore @xmath4 , which increased substantially with increasing @xmath2 when @xmath122  @xcite , did not show such strong tendency when @xmath129 .",
    "changing @xmath130 seems then to change even the qualitative characteristics of forced polymer translocation .    the change of @xmath4 in the scaling @xmath3 due to a change in @xmath26 is hardly surprising .",
    "however , @xmath4 changing with @xmath130 is a bit more subtle .",
    "it suggests that we are actually looking at the forced translocation in a continually changing or transient stage .",
    "this is in accord with our previous finding that for polymers of lengths that are used in simulations , @xmath131 , the number of moving polymer beads changes throughout the translocation and thus continually alters the force balance condition resulting from the forced translocation taking place out of equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "also the crowding of the polymer beads on the _ trans _ side , whose relaxation toward equilibrium is slower than the translocation rate changes the force balance continually .",
    "hence , the simulated forced translocation processes do not reveal the asymptotic ( @xmath10 ) characteristics for experimentally relevant pore force magnitudes .",
    "then reporting scaling exponents for such forced translocation seems unwarranted .",
    "the remaining question of interest then is , why does the forced translocation exhibit the scaling albeit with varying exponents ?      for simulations at low pore force the chains were initially placed halfway through the pore unlike at large pore force where the polymer was placed so that only its end was inside the pore . at the very low force of @xmath132 the pore model was found to affect only slightly the absolute value of @xmath41 , see fig .",
    "[ model_scaling ]  ( b ) . for the bead pore model chains of length",
    "@xmath133 had a finite probability to escape to the _ cis _ side .",
    "unlike for the bead pore , even some of the @xmath74 beads long polymers escaped to the _ cis _ side for the cylindrical pore .",
    "this is probably due to the cylindrical pore aligning the polymer chain toward the pore axis in the middle thus effectively reducing the friction between the polymer and the pore .    for the pore force @xmath134",
    "we obtain @xmath135 , see fig .  [ model_scaling ]  ( b ) , which is the expected exponent for unforced translocation , @xmath136 , since @xmath137 has been measured for the swelling exponent in our model  @xcite . approaching the unforced case",
    "makes the translocation dynamics increasingly robust to variations in the model , which is a natural consequence of the small pore force not dominating over entropic forces .",
    "we regard the pore force magnitude @xmath82 already small enough for the translocating polymer to remain close to equilibrium , see fig .",
    "[ transfer_raw ] .",
    "however , we did not obtain a clear scaling for @xmath132 for either pore models , but @xmath4 close to the unforced translocation value @xmath138 was obtained for chains shorter than @xmath139 while a lower value of @xmath4 was obtained for longer chains .",
    "this applies for both @xmath140 and @xmath141 , see fig .",
    "[ model_scaling ]  ( b ) .",
    "we expect the lower value of @xmath4 to be @xmath142 ( see  @xcite ) , although a wider range of @xmath51 would be needed to confirm this .",
    "this apparent cross - over behavior for low pore force is outside the scope of the present paper and calls for a separate , more thorough investigation .",
    "for the presumably small pore force @xmath95 we obtained @xmath143 .",
    "this differs considerably from @xmath144 reported in  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ transfer_raw ] it can be seen that @xmath79 for @xmath95 clearly deviates from the close - to - unforced form of @xmath79 for @xmath132 .",
    "together with the low value of @xmath4 this observation suggests that @xmath95 is large enough to drive the polymer more and more out of equilibrium as the translocation proceeds .",
    "the different values for @xmath4 here and in  @xcite also support this view , since the two simulations started from different initial positions . when the relaxation time of the polymer toward thermal equilibrium is slower than the translocation time , the process possesses memory , or correlation over time , _",
    "i.e. _ the memory function @xmath145 .",
    "thus , a polymer starting half - way through the pore is in a different state than a polymer that has arrived at this position and started from another initial position .",
    "the data presented for different pore force magnitudes in sections  [ pmod ] and [ lowf ] show that for @xmath146 the value of @xmath4 increases with increasing pore force  @xcite also for the bead pore .",
    "for very low pore force @xmath4 is found independent of the pore force .",
    "in summary , we have simulated forced polymer translocation in 3d by using langevin dynamics .",
    "we have implemented two pore models in our algorithm , ( i ) a pore surrounded by eight immobile beads , which we call bead pore and ( ii ) a cylindrical pore where a damped harmonic potential confines the beads inside the pore region .",
    "the present study compares the effect these two pores have on the forced translocation .",
    "we measured the forward transition probabilities @xmath91 to determine the range of pore force that would be sufficiently large to include cases where polymer translocation takes place close to and strongly out of equilibrium .",
    "we found that the polymer remains close to equilibrium when the total pore force @xmath147 . here",
    "the translocation dynamics was found to be robust to variations in the translocation model , such as the details of the pore .",
    "@xmath91 was found to deviate significantly from the close - to - equilibrium form already for a pore force as small as @xmath83 .",
    "the polymer was found to be driven far from equilibrium when @xmath148 .    for small pore force magnitudes the forced translocation processes are identical for the two pore models .",
    "however , the translocation characteristics were found to be increasingly model dependent when the pore force is increased .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the dynamics of the forced translocation being determined by a continually changing force - balance condition when the pore force is large enough , _",
    "i.e. _ ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "accordingly , it seems that universal exponents for the forced translocation can not be found in the biologically relevant pore force regime .",
    "in addition , attempts to define a control parameter whose magnitude would consistently determine these exponents would seem futile , which we showed for one proposed candidate by using the bead pore . qualitatively the forced translocation exhibited similar characteristics with both pore models , most notably the increase with the pore force of the exponent determining the relation between the average translocation time and the polymer length .",
