    "<S> correlation studies exhibit a ridge - like feature in rapidity and azimuthal angle , with and without a jet trigger . </S>",
    "<S> we ask whether the feature in untriggered correlations can be a consequence of transverse flow and viscous diffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> jet correlation measurements display a ridge of enhanced particle emission that is broad in pseudorapidity @xmath0 and narrow in azimuthal angle @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many have attributed this ` hard ridge ' to the passage of the jet through the high - density environment produced by the nuclear collision ; see e.g. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a similar ridge feature is exhibited in untriggered correlation studies where no jet tag is present @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as with the hard ridge , the width of the untagged ` soft ridge ' broadens in @xmath0 and narrows in @xmath1 for collisions of higher centrality ( smaller impact parameter ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we ask whether the @xmath2 dependence of the soft ridge in untagged correlations can be a consequence of radial flow and viscous diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between radial flow and momentum correlations has been stressed elsewhere @xcite . in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite we attributed the rapidity broadening of untriggered momentum correlations to viscous diffusion , extracting an estimate of the viscosity - to - entropy ratio in the range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that viscous diffusion together with flow can explain the centrality dependence of the soft ridge ; see fig .  1 ( right ) .    the soft ridge has been observed both in momentum fluctuation studies @xcite and multiplicity correlation measurements @xcite . here , we focus on the momentum correlation results , which we argue depend strongly on the viscosity of the high density liquid produced in collisions . </S>",
    "<S> our hope is to eventually reduce the rather large uncertainty in the viscosity estimate in @xcite by using the full landscape of @xmath5 correlations , rather than just the @xmath0 dependence . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we first recall the role of shear viscosity in the evolution of momentum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we survey the hydrodynamic formulation of @xcite , extending it to include transverse flow . </S>",
    "<S> we then confront the soft ridge .    </S>",
    "<S> central nuclear collisions produce a fluid that flows outward with an average transverse velocity @xmath6 . in the hydrodynamic description of these collisions </S>",
    "<S> , we typically assume that @xmath6 varies smoothly with spacetime @xmath7 and is the same for all collisions of a fixed impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> more realistically , small deviations relative to @xmath6 occur throughout the fluid , varying with each collision event . </S>",
    "<S> such deviations occur , e.g. , because the number and location of nucleon - nucleon subcollisions varies in each event .    </S>",
    "<S> viscous friction arises as neighboring elements of the fluid flow past one another . </S>",
    "<S> this friction drives the stress - energy tensor toward the local average @xmath8 , where the energy density is @xmath9 , the pressure is @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the extent to which variations @xmath12 survive the collision depends on the magnitude of the viscosity and the lifetime of the fluid . near a point where @xmath13 , the momentum current @xmath14 satisfies a diffusion equation , @xmath15 , where the kinematic viscosity is @xmath16 @xcite . to incorporate effects of radial and elliptic flow , </S>",
    "<S> we assume bjorken longitudinal flow in the @xmath17 direction coupled to a radial flow @xmath18 in the transverse plane that depends only on @xmath19 and @xmath20 . we write </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 where we take @xmath22 for simplicity .    </S>",
    "<S> momentum density fluctuations and their dissipation by viscosity are characterized by the correlation function @xmath23 where the brackets represent an average over an ensemble of events . </S>",
    "<S> the difference @xmath24 of @xmath25 from its local equilibrium value @xmath26 also satisfies a diffusion equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that these momentum density correlations are observable by the relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 labels particles from each event and @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim is then to reconstruct @xmath24 by measuring @xmath30 in different windows of rapidity and azimuthal angle ; we emphasized the role of rapidity in determining the viscosity in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while measurements of @xmath30 would be ideal , much can be learned from @xmath31 correlation measurements at rhic and sps that used somewhat different observables . </S>",
    "<S> star measures the quantity @xmath32 ceres and star also measure the related quantity @xmath33 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our covariance @xmath30 is sensitive to the variation of the @xmath31 of particles as well as their number density , since both quantities effect the momentum current density . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are designed to minimize the number density contribution . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities are related by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 measures the number density contribution .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( right ) centrality dependence of the width of the near side peak in @xmath38 and @xmath39 as a function of centrality . </S>",
    "<S> centrality is determined using @xmath40 as in @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=259 ] [ fig:1a ]    . </S>",
    "<S> ( right ) centrality dependence of the width of the near side peak in @xmath38 and @xmath39 as a function of centrality . </S>",
    "<S> centrality is determined using @xmath40 as in @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] [ fig:1b ]    star employs @xmath34 to construct a correlation function as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , they measure @xmath34 in various @xmath41 and @xmath38 bins , and use the data to construct a correlation function @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 ; see @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> they find a near - side ridge peaked at @xmath44 together with other features attributable to momentum conservation , elliptic flow , and perhaps other phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> our primary focus is the near - side peak in azimuth  the soft ridge  as shown in fig .  1 ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 ( right ) shows the widths of this peak in azimuth @xmath45 and rapidity @xmath46 as functions of centrality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> centrality is measured using the combination @xmath40 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are , respectively , the numbers of binary collisions and participants . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of @xmath46 with centrality was used in @xcite to estimate the shear viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion increases the width of @xmath25 relative to its value in peripheral collisions by an amount @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the freeze out times in central and peripheral collisions . </S>",
    "<S> transverse flow does not appreciably alter @xmath46 , since @xmath6 is only weakly dependent on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the large uncertainty range for the viscosity in @xcite follows from the unknown number density contribution relating @xmath34 to @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to consider the role of viscous diffusion and transverse flow in determining the width in the azimuthal angle as a function of centrality in fig .  1 ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> to see why flow is important , we consider a blast wave model of the mean flow . in a central collision , @xmath52 . a fluid cell a distance @xmath53 from the center of the collision volume has a mean speed @xmath6 prior to freeze out </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the opening angle into which two particles from this cell emerge is @xmath54 , for a thermal velocity @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces correlations , since particles near the center of the collision volume have a large opening angle , while those from a larger @xmath53 have a smaller @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar correlation may affect the hard ridge as well @xcite .    to compute the angular correlations that result from flow and diffusion , </S>",
    "<S> we write the momentum correlation function @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the boltzmann distribution , @xmath58 is the density , and the integral is over the cooper - frye freeze out surface @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> solution of the diffusion equation for @xmath60 derived from ( [ eq : temp2 ] ) yields the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the azimuthal width @xmath45 by integrating ( [ eq : momcorr ] ) using ( [ eq : spacecorr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use ( [ eq : temp2 ] ) to compute the spatial widths @xmath64 and @xmath65 as functions of the proper time @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of elliptic and radial flow are included by assuming an eccentric blast wave form @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of flow is determined by fitting the measured @xmath68 and elliptic flow coefficient @xmath69 as in fig .  2 .     [ fig:1a ]     [ fig:1b ]    the result shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( right ) agrees well with the data . </S>",
    "<S> observe that viscous diffusion and transverse flow have the opposite effect on @xmath45 . in the absence of flow </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath45 would increase as a function of centrality due to diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , information from @xmath45 and @xmath46 can constrain the viscosity - to - entropy ratio extracted from measurements of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> values in the range @xmath70 are consistent with the data in fig .  2 , with other parameters </S>",
    "<S> held fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the problem remains , however , that @xmath71 is measured , not @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the large uncertainty due to the possible role of density fluctuations remains . </S>",
    "<S> direct measurements of @xmath30 are needed to eliminate that uncertainty ; until such data become available the estimate @xmath72 stands @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added : _ after the completion of this manuscript we learned of work explaining the amplitude of the soft ridge as a consequence of glasma correlations plus radial flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors do not explain the centrality dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while we do not address the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we view these results aa complementary , since glasma may well determine the initial conditions for hydrodynamic evolution .    </S>",
