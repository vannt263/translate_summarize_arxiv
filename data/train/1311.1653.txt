    "the existence of circumnuclear rings , defined as circular or near circular structures of enhanced star formation around the nucleus of some galaxies , was first noted by srsic and pastoriza in 1967 , when they realized that the central parts of some peculiar galaxies showed a rate of star formation much higher than it was expected in objects of their characteristics ( @xcite ) . typically located within the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and surrounding their nucleus or a central region in which luminous matter is not detected ,",
    "the study of these rings , as places where star formation seems to be increased ( although some dusty red nuclear rings have been reported in elliptical and so galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ) , has been proved to be of great importance to understand the internal dynamics of galaxies and their secular evolution ( @xcite ) .                    due to this reason",
    ", many studies can be found in the literature concerning ring galaxies from different points of view : chemical , dynamical or relative to stellar populations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that nuclear rings contain a mixture of neutral and ionized gas and dust with average masses of @xmath8 m@xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "also the common association of star forming regions and resonances suggests a close link between star formation and the dynamical behaviour of galaxies . depending on the longevity of the ring , its ability to replenish itself with gas and its effectiveness as a barrier for gas inflow to the nucleus , the ring will play an increasingly important role in the secular evolution of the galaxy . +",
    "the relationship of these structures with bars and non axisymmetric features in the inner parts of galaxies has been studied by @xcite and @xcite among others .",
    "theoretical models ( @xcite ; @xcite a ) b ) ; @xcite ) in which the behaviour of gas in the galactic potential is simulated , show a relationship between the presence of a circumnuclear ring and the existence of resonances at the ends of a nuclear bar , since in these places the gas loses angular momentum and stops its infall towards the interior of the potential well of the galaxy .",
    "these nuclear rings are the locations of strong density enhancements of gas inside which massive star formation is often detected .",
    "the general objective of this work is to understand the nature and evolution processes that take place within hii regions located in circumnuclear rings of galaxies and characterize the star population present in each knot : its mass , age , extinction parameters , etc .",
    "we intend to determine whether the hii region properties are linked to galactic parameters such as hubble type , nuclear activity or environment ; finding out the role that circumnuclear activity plays in the wider frame of galactic star formation .    to achieve these aims we present photometry in u , b , v , r and i broad continuum bands and in narrow h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 filters for a sample of 336 circumnuclear star forming regions ( cnsfr ) located in 20 early type spiral galaxies with different levels of activity in their nuclei .",
    "the sample is described in  2 .",
    "information on the observations and data reduction can be found in  3 .",
    "the ring definition adopted and data analysis are explained in  4 ;  5 is devoted to the presentation of results and their discussion .",
    "finally , in  6 we present a brief summary and the main conclusions of the work .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the most prominent lines present in the broad - band filters are : + u : [ oii ] 3727  ; [ neiii ] 3868  . +",

    "+ i : [ siii ] 9069,9532  + in order to check the effect that these lines could have on the observed colours and therefore on the conclusions of this work , we have added narrow lines synthesized by @xcite to starburst99 continuum emission models for a single burst of star formation .",
    "we have chosen physical parameters for the gas that match those most commonly observed in star forming regions located in the very inner parts of galaxies , namely : solar or oversolar abundances , mup=100 m@xmath9 , m@xmath10=@xmath11 m@xmath9 , n@xmath12 . h@xmath0 and [ oii ]",
    "lines reach their maximum effect at very early ages of the burst ( less than 3 myr ) , while h@xmath1 and [ oiii ] do it later . around their maximum , between 15 and 20% of the theoretical flux in the corresponding broad band has its origin in the narrow lines .",
    "these theoretical values hence represent an upper limit given that no additional , non - ionizing star population has been considered . when compared with observed values , the h@xmath1",
    "flux amounts to about 6% of the b filter at its maximum .",
    "although the presence of narrow lines has no much influence on colours , the r and b filter fluxes have been corrected for h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission .",
    "+ despite all the above , the main source of uncertainty comes from the right determination of the radius of each hii region ( see discussion in section 4.2 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate realistic errors , the fluxes inside the adopted radius plus and minus one pixel have been computed for each region in each frame .",
    "the absolute value of this error is bigger that that associated with narrow line contamination or non uniform background and therefore is the only error value quoted.it has been included in table 5 as @xmath13 f and in table 6 .",
    "the results of our measurements for each of the studied regions in a given galaxy can be found in tables [ narrow - results ] and [ broad - results ] . table [ narrow - results ] lists in column 1 the identification number of the region ; in column 2 the distance for the galaxy nucleus in arcsec ; in column 3 the position from the galaxy nucleus in arcsec ; in column 4 the logarithm of the h@xmath0 luminosity in units of erg s@xmath14 ; in column 5 the quotient @xmath13f over f ; in column 6 the equivalent width of the h@xmath0 line in  ; in column 7 the equivalent width of the h@xmath0 line in  ; and finaly in column 8 the value of the visual extinction a@xmath6 in magnitudes .",

    "some authors have reported that extinction of hii regions , derived from the comparison of balmer lines together with radio continuum in the magellanic clouds and other external galaxies , is slightly higher than that derived from balmer lines alone , so in a conservative sense , our values should be taken as lower limits ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "fig [ halpha - lum ] shows a histogram of the extinction corrected h@xmath0 luminosity of the studied regions .",

    "no clear correlation seems to exist between h@xmath0 luminosity of the regions and interaction signatures of the host galaxy , nevertheless the most luminous hii regions are found in non interacting galaxies , with nuclear activity ( sy2 ) and sb - sbc morphologies .",

    "this parameter seems to be related with the nature of the hii regions , and some authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) find a break between radiation and matter bounded regions at log ( l(h@xmath0 ) ) of about 38.5 .",
    "given that we do not find this break , and being the luminosities of our studied regions all above this value ( some small and low luminosity regions might have been missed due to overcrowding or resolution limits ) , we conclude that most of our cnsfr should be in the high luminosity matter bounded tail of the luminosity function . no other significant difference with normal disk hii regions has been found . plotting the whole set of hii regions together ( fig [ lum - func ] ) , we find that the luminosity function becomes steeper at higher @xmath15 luminosities . bins of 0.5 in log(l(@xmath15 ) )",
    "have been considered given that this is the uncertainty of the log(l(@xmath15 ) ) computed for each region in a radius of plus and minus one pixel ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "the slope varies from 0.2 for less luminous regions , to 2.3 for the high luminosity tail .",
    "no correlation with nuclear activity or host galaxy interaction features has been found either .    furthermore , radiation bounded regions follow a relationship between log[l(h@xmath0 ] vs log(radius ) with a slope of about 3 ( fig .",
    "[ lum - rad ] ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have found for the individual galaxies of our sample an average value of 2.04 @xmath20 0.6 with minimum and maximum values of 1.15 in ngc  5248 and about 3 in ngc  5954 ( 3.1 ) , ngc  3949 ( 2.9 ) and ngc  5953 ( 3.2 ) .",

    "this may point to the hii regions in these latter three galaxies being radiation bounded .",
    "two main effects could be affecting the value of the slope making it appear lower ; firstly , in overcrowded fields , the radius of a region can be underestimated with respect to isolated regions .",
    "this seems to happen more frequently for low luminosity regions . in this case",

    "we find values of u - b that vary from -1.4 to 0.6 ( fig [ colour - colour ] ) which will imply burst ages ranging from 2 to 20 myrs for over - solar metallicity models , following a bimodal distribution with two maximum values , -0.7 and -0.3    this second value mainly corresponds to hii regions located in non - interacting galaxies .",
    "no clear trend is found in relation with morphological , nuclear type or barred structures .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram [ ( u - b ) vs u ] ( fig [ u - u - b ] ) suggests a correlation in the sense that more luminous regions are also bluer , although some regions do not follow this trend .",
    "two effects seem to overlap : age  older regions are less luminous and redder due to the death of massive ob stars  and a mass effect , given that in some galaxies all their hii regions have constant u - b colour and a great dispersion in u values .",
    "continuum emission in the red has its origin mostly in stars in their red supergiant evolutionary phase which show an average r - i of 0.9 .",

    "the distribution of r - i colour is bimodal with a first maximum at r - i @xmath30 0.9 , matching with non - interacting barred galaxies , and a second maximum at @xmath30 0.6 .",
    "higher dispersion values are found when compared with the u - b distribution , maybe due to a mixture of infrared sources .",
    "summing up , in the u vs u - b plot ( fig [ u - u - b ] ) , hii regions show an homogeneous behaviour and values close to those of a young open cluster .",
    "this homogeneity does not exist in the i vs r - i color - magnitude diagram where metallicity and evolutionary effects can be seen . in both colour - magnitude plots ,",

    "however , in the colour - colour diagram ( fig [ colour - colour ] ) our regions seem to segregate from the comparison sample , showing redder colours . if this figure is considered together with [ ew - red ] even though only    figure 7 must be considered together with figure 11 .",
    "even though only markarian objects are in common , it can be checked that while in the ew line vs red colours data overlap , this effect disappears when a pure ( u - b ) colour is introduced .",
    "the cause of this split effect , could be a second redder poorly or non ionizing population of stars that is present in some individual hii regions .",
    "we can attribute this latter behaviour to four main reasons :    * an age effect , the ew(h@xmath0 ) diminishes as the burst gets older and it also appears redder . * a metallicity effect . in the colour - magnitude ( i vs r - i ) of fig [ i - ri ] , only ngc",
    "3310 is segregated from the other galaxies .",
    "ngc 3310 is known to be a low metallicity object , so the others must have solar o oversolar metallicities .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) * there could be a mismatch in the estimation of extinction , although computed values agree within errors with those available in the literature .",
    "* we may be detecting a composite stellar population . under this scenario ,",
    "a very young population would be responsible for most of the ew(h@xmath0 ) , while a population older than 10 myr would be the source of the red continuum and responsible for the detection of ew(h@xmath0 ) values smaller than those expected for a single burst of ionizing stars .",
    "besides the above , some remarks on individual objects can be made .",
    "hii regions in ngc 4321 show low u emission but average h@xmath0 luminosities due maybe to an additional ionization source rather than only young stars .",
    "even more interesting are the regions with no peculiar behaviour in luminosity or colours but with unexpected low h@xmath0 ew , as for instance those located in ngc 4314 .",
    " are we observing overlapping stellar populations of different ages ? to disentangle between effects than can be present simultaneously in a galaxy , and to achieve a better understanding of the nature and evolution of every individual hii region , a closer insight to each of them , in the light of theoretical evolutionary models , is needed .",

    "from high quality continuum subtracted @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and u , b , r , i broad band images of a sample of 20 galaxies with different degrees of nuclear activity and circumnuclear star formation , we have catalogued a total of 336 hii regions .",

    "given the galaxy integrated absolute magnitude ( b band ) this radius can be simply computed , so hii regions beyond this radius will not be misclassified as circumnuclear .",
    "using @xmath22 theoretical values , together with observed narrow h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 images , has allowed us to correct colours from extinction and disentangle age and metallicity effects .",
    "the visual extinction values found ( a@xmath6 ) range from 0 to 4.75 magnitudes with an average value of 1.85 , in good agreement with other published values .",
    "we have found no correlation between extinction and galactocentric distance or region size .",
    "we have found loose correlations between extinction and luminosities or colours , with redder compact sources showing higher extinction values .",
    "circumnuclear hii regions are known to be very bright , the h@xmath0 luminosities range we have found , varies from @xmath31 to @xmath3 , with most of the regions showing values of log[l(h@xmath32 \\geq$ ] 39 , therefore we are mostly dealing with giant hii regions .",
    "no clear correlation seems to exist between h@xmath0 luminosity and other galactic features as morphology or nuclear activity of the host galaxy .",
    "studying the behaviour of the h@xmath0 luminosity function and the dependence of luminosity on the radius of each region , we infer that , at least some of the biggest and less luminous regions , could be matter bounded .",

    "their host galaxies are either sy2 or liners .",
    "values of ew(h@xmath0 ) larger than 450  , are only found in interacting galaxies .",

    "seem to be bluer and show higher values of ew(h@xmath0 ) , on average , than hii regions located in the other types of galaxy .",
    "this fact suggests younger ages for the former regions if the metallicity of the galaxies is similar .    on the other hand , in colour - magnitude , colour - colour and ew(h@xmath0)-colour diagrams our hii regions appear to segregate from a comparison sample of simple stellar populations known to be present in young hii regions",
    "this fact may be attributed to age , metallicity or mismatching extinction corrected effects .",
    "it may also be due to the presence of a second young but non - ionizing population of stars , that would make the ionizing burst appear redder .",
    "the continuum coming from this second older burst would also be responsible for low values of the ew(h@xmath0 ) .    to study whether or not this second non - ionizing burst is present , and in which proportion for each cluster , a closer look into the nature of hii regions in the light of theoretical evolutionary models is proposed in a forthcoming paper .",
