    "a misalignment produces mainly field deviations along the @xmath16-axis and to a lesser degree in the radial direction .",
    "hence the parallel alignment of the cathode relative to the anode was defined less stringently and required to be precise within @xmath17{\\upmu m}$ ] .",
    "the length of the field cage is not a critical parameter because it can be adjusted by positioning the cathode inside the field cage .",

    "the field cage was manufactured over a forming tool which served as a mold .",
    "this was a 75-cm long mandrel with a diameter of @xmath0{cm}$ ]  according to the field cage s inner diameter .",
    "the mandrel could be reduced in diameter by a few millimeter via an expansion slot .    in the first step of the production , the field strip board",
    "was positioned on the mandrel ( fig .",
    "[ mandrellwithfoil ] ) .",
    "two 1-mm deep slots had been machined into the mandrel surface to accommodate the resistors on the field strip board .",
    "then , the different layers of the field cage wall were laminated onto the foil . for the production of the grp ,",
    "first a glass - fiber canvas was put onto the mandrel ( fig .",
    "[ grplayer ] ) and moisturized with epoxy glue .",
    "afterwards , air inclusions were removed from the layer with an underpressure treatment and the epoxy cured at @xmath20{^\\circ c}$ ] .",
    "the curing temperature was kept as low as possible to reduce thermal stresses on the field cage .    in the following steps of the production ,",
    "the pre - produced end flanges and the honeycomb were laminated onto the inner grp layer . on top , a layer of aramid paper sealed the cells of the honeycomb ( see fig .",

    "a direct lamination of the outer grp layer onto the open honeycomb could have filled the cells with epoxy and caused a higher and inhomogeneous material buildup of the wall .",

    "a tilt of the axis was found , which results in a maximum offset of @xmath25{\\upmu m}$ ] relative to the nominal position at the cathode ( fig .",

    "the field inhomogeneities have a magnitude of @xmath32 .",
    "for the ild , a tpc is planned with a diameter of the inner field cage of @xmath33{cm}$ ] , of the outer field cage of @xmath34{cm}$ ] and a drift distance of @xmath35{cm}$ ] .",
    "this is about 3.5 times longer than the lp . at the same time , the magnetic field of ild is @xmath36{t}$ ] compared to @xmath18{t}$ ] for the lp . as mentioned in section [ introsection ] , the ratio @xmath37 of the magnetic field to the drift distance @xmath38 is the same for both tpcs and so are the required relative mechanical accuracy specifications .",
    "scaling the mechanical tolerances of the lp by a factor of three yields a tolerance for the alignment of the field cage axis in the range of @xmath39{\\upmu m}$ ] and a required parallel alignment of anode and cathode of @xmath40{\\upmu m}$ ] for the ild tpc .    the main challenge for the design of the ild tpc will be the reduction of the material budget of the wall to @xmath41{x_0}$ ] while increasing the high voltage stability to @xmath42{kv})$ ] .",
    "starting from the current lp wall cross section ( see fig .",
    "[ sketchofwall ] ) , a reduction of the material budget is possible by thinning down the field strips to @xmath9{\\upmu m}$ ] and by replacing copper by aluminum . in addition , with further optimization studies of the chamber statics and mechanical tests , the thickness of the grp could be diminished .",
    "this would reduce the contribution of epoxy and glass - fiber to the material budget . assuming a moderate optimization , grp layers of @xmath43{\\upmu m}$ ] could be sufficiently stable to construct a self supporting tube of @xmath44{m}$ ] length for the inner field cage .",
    "the lp wall samples were tested to be high voltage stable up to at least @xmath45{kv}$ ] . in the wall sample tested , a single polyimide layer of @xmath46{\\upmu m}$ ] was introduced which can withstand @xmath47{kv}$ ] alone .",
    "the insulating honeycomb - grp structure increased the high voltage stability to above @xmath45{kv}$ ] .    extrapolating to the ild tpc",
    ", the wall of the inner field cage could have a cross section as shown in figure  [ sketchoffinalwall ] . here ,",
    "an insulation which is equivalent to a single @xmath39{\\upmu m}$ ] thick polyimide layer together with the honeycomb sandwich provide a high voltage stability in the range of @xmath48{kv}$ ] .",
    "this wall has a material budget of @xmath41{x_0}$ ] , which is the design value .",
    "however , the detailed fabrication of the thicker polyimide layer still has to be evaluated and tested .",
    "the outer field cage of the ild tpc will be a single barrel structure serving as gas vessel and high voltage insulation .",
    "its material budget goal is planned to be @xmath49{x_0}$ ] at most . at the same time",
    "the wall must be thicker than the one for the inner field cage to gain sufficient mechanical robustness .",
    "a wall thickness of @xmath20{mm}$ ] , which could provide a sufficient stability , can be realized by scaling up the thickness of the honeycomb material and doubling the thickness of the grp layers . in this case",
    ", the material budget would reach the design value of @xmath49{x_0}$ ] .",
    "it must be stated , that the mechanical and the high voltage stability , both for the proposed inner and outer field cage wall , need to be quantified by dedicated calculations and sample piece tests .",
    "also the precise mechanical accuracy specifications have to be revisited on the basis of further studies , also taking into account the final detector gas .",
    "the lp is the first tpc prototype with a size relevant for a tpc of a future ilc detector .",
    "the length of the lp is @xmath1{cm}$ ] and the inner diameter of the field cage barrel of @xmath0{cm}$ ] is similar to the inner field cage for the ild tpc .",
    "the design of the chamber was optimized for a high electric field homogeneity of @xmath3 and a low material budget of the walls of @xmath50{x_0}$ ] .",
    "this is close to the final design value of @xmath41{x_0}$ ] .",
    "further optimizations of the wall structure are under study and the final design goal of @xmath41{x_0}$ ] per wall seems to be in reach .",
    "the lp is part of a test beam infrastructure which is installed at the 6-gev desy electron test beam .",
    "this infrastructure was realized in the framework of the project  @xcite and became available in november 2008 . since",
    "then it is in use by different research groups doing r&d work for a tpc of detector at a future linear collider @xcite .",
    "this work is supported by the commission of the european communities under the 6@xmath51 framework programme ` structuring the european research area ' , contract number rii3 - 026126 .",
