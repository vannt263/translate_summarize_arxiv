    "in 1998 just 50 years have passed after the publication of the famous paper by casimir [ 1 ] ( see the proceedings [ 2 ] especially devoted to this event ) .",
    "accidentally the experimental interest in the casimir effect was rekindled at the same time . in ref.[3 ] the torsion pendulum was used to measure the casimir force between @xmath0 plus @xmath1 coated quartz plate , and a spherical lens in a distance range from 0.6   to 6 . the accuracy of order 5%",
    "was claimed in [ 3 ] for the agreement of the measurement with theory . in refs.[46 ] the casimir force between @xmath2 plus @xmath3 coated disk and a sphere was measured for surface separations between 0.1   to 0.9  using the atomic force microscope .",
    "the deviation between theory and experiment was shown to be of around 1% at the smallest surface separation [ 4,6,7 ] .",
    "the obtained experimental results and the extent of their agreement with theory were used to establish stronger constraints for the parameters of hypothetical long - range interactions predicted by the unified gauge theories , supersymmetry and supergravity [ 811 ] .    to be confident that data fit theory at a level of about several percent , the different corrections to the ideal expression for the casimir force should be taken into account .",
    "the main contribution is given by the corrections due to finite conductivity of the boundary metal , its roughness and due to non - zero temperature ( see [ 12 ] for review ) .",
    "experimental data of [ 3 ] do not support the presence of any of these corrections although they should contribute at a level of 5% .",
    "by contrast , in [ 4,6 ] the surface roughness and finite conductivity corrections are of great concern ( the temperature corrections are negligible in the measurement range of [ 4,6 ] ) .",
    "the subject of the present paper is the calculation of higher order finite conductivity corrections to the casimir force in relative penetration depth of electromagnetic zero oscillations into the metal .",
    "we consider configurations of two plane parallel plates and a sphere above a plate .",
    "the first order finite conductivity correction was found in [ 13 ] for configuration of two plane parallel plates with an error in numerical coefficient corrected in [ 14 ] .",
    "later the correct result was reobtained in [ 15 ] .",
    "second order correction was firstly found in [ 16 ] ( see also [ 12 ] ) .",
    "it was modified for the configuration of a sphere above a disk in [ 17 ] by the use of proximity force theorem ( pft ) [ 18 ] .",
    "the results of [ 16,17 ] for the casimir force up to the second power in relative penetration depth are in common use when discussing the recent experiments ( see , e.g. , [ 4,6,7,1921 ] ) . in [ 7,10 ] the third and",
    "the fourth order corrections were obtained approximately from the interpolation formula .",
    "they allowed to achieve the excellent agreement between theory and experiment .    in [ 19 ] numerical calculation of the casimir force with account of finite conductivity",
    "has been attempted based on the tabulated data for the complex dielectric permittivity as a function of frequency .",
    "the same computation was repeated in [ 21 ] with the diverged results .",
    "the reason of these differences was interpreted in [ 21 ] as the invalid manipulation of optical data in [ 19 ] .",
    "our analytical calculation of higher order conductivity corrections agrees with the results of [ 21 ] in the application range of perturbation approach .",
    "as shown below the perturbation results obtained in the context of plasma model are valid with rather high accuracy when the distance between the test bodies is larger than the plasma wavelength ( not much larger as advocated in [ 20 ] ) .",
    "this gives the possibility , in some instance , to use the plasma model for the distances of order or even less than the characteristic absorption wavelength of test body material .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the general finite results for the casimir energy density and force are briefly presented .",
    "sec .  3 contains derivation of the third and fourth order conductivity corrections . in sec .",
    "4 the obtained perturbation results are compared with numerical calculations .",
    "5 contains conclusions and discussion .",
    "let us consider two semi - infinite solids with dielectric permittivity @xmath4 separated by a plane - parallel gap of width @xmath5 .",
    "the surfaces of the bodies are planes @xmath6 .",
    "the casimir energy density and force acting between these bodies can be found most simply following [ 22,23 ] ( see also [ 24 ] for the multilayered walls ) .",
    "some additional clarification is given here in the case in which the finite energy density rather than force is the subject of interest .",
    "the mode frequencies of electromagnetic field are found from maxwell equations supplemented by the standard boundary conditions at @xmath6 .",
    "two types of such frequencies @xmath7 ( surface modes [ 25 ] ) corresponding to two polarizations of the electric field are the solutions of the equations & & ^(1 ) ( _ , n^(1 ) ) ^2 k_^2 e^-k_a=0 , + & & ^(2 ) ( _ , n^(2 ) ) k_^2 e^-k_a=0 .",

    "it is seen that ( [ 24 ] ) is in excellent agreement with computational results of @xcite for all @xmath38 .",
    "for example , for @xmath39 m , @xmath40 m and @xmath41 m it follows from ( [ 24 ] ) that @xmath42 , 0.85 and 0.97 which can be compared with computations of @xcite : 0.55 , 0.85 , and 0.96 , respectively .    in fig .  1b , the analogical results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown .",
    "the dashed lines were obtained with @xmath43 nm . for the typical distances indicated above it follows from ( [ 24 ] ) that @xmath44 , 0.81 and 0.96 which can be compared with the values : 0.48 , 0.81 and 0.96 @xcite .",
    "the difference in the first values is due to @xmath45 nm , i.e. ( [ 24 ] ) is not applicable for @xmath46 nm in case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath47 the results agree perfectly well .",
    "note that the values of plasma wavelength @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the effective mass of conduction electrons , @xmath50 is their density are known not very precisely . for @xmath2 , usually @xmath51 nm is used @xcite . for @xmath1 and @xmath0 the value @xmath52 nm was estimated recently @xcite .",
    "we used a bit different values which provide the smallest rms deviation between the computational results and the ones obtained from ( [ 24 ] ) ( in @xcite @xmath53 nm ) .",

    "was firstly performed in @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that our analytical results are in contradiction with @xcite . by way of example , at @xmath58 m for @xmath1 and @xmath0 one can find in @xcite @xmath59 and 0.837 correspondingly whereas according to our results @xmath60 for both metals . at the same distance and metals for a lens above a plate @xmath61 and",
    "0.874 @xcite whereas from eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) one gets @xmath62 .",
    "our results , however , are in good agreement with the alternative computations of @xcite supporting the conclusion of @xcite that the manipulation of optical data in @xcite is invalid",
    ".    it might be well to compare also the exact third and fourth order conductivity corrections obtained above with the approximate ones obtained by the use of interpolation formula @xcite .",
    "to take one example , for the force between a lens and a plate the coefficients near the third and fourth order corrections in interpolation formula are @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( compare with @xmath65 and @xmath66 from ( [ 29 ] ) ) .",
    "for the smallest separations @xmath67 nm in experiment @xcite and @xmath68 for @xmath2 this leads to the 0.5% difference only in the results obtained by the interpolation formula @xcite and by ( [ 29 ] ) .",
    "in the above the third and the fourth order corrections to the casimir force due to finite conductivity of the metal were calculated analytically in configurations of two plane parallel plates and a spherical lens ( or a sphere ) above a plate .",
    "the casimir forces ( [ 24 ] ) , ( [ 29 ] ) are in excellent agreement with computations of @xcite based on the tabulated data for the complex dielectric permittivity for all distances larger than the effective plasma wavelength of the test body metal .",
    "what this means is that the results ( [ 24 ] ) , ( [ 29 ] ) can be reliably used even for the distances @xmath5 less than the characteristic absorption wavelength @xmath69 if @xmath70 ( this is a case , e.g. , for @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which are characterized by @xmath71 nm or for cr with @xmath72 nm , @xmath73 nm @xcite ) .    to obtain the higher order conductivity corrections we have used the plasma model representing dielectric permittivity by the eq .",
    ". this model does not take into account relaxation processes .",
    "however , the relaxation parameter is much smaller than the plasma frequency .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , relaxation could play some role only for large distances between plates @xmath74 and even there the variation of the corrections to the casimir force due to it is smaller than 2% .",
    "if to take into account that for so large distances the corrections themselves decrease very quickly it becomes evident that the influence of relaxation can be neglected .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to stress that both the results ( [ 24 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) are of the same accuracy in spite of the fact that the pft was used in ( [ 15 ] ) to obtain ( [ 29 ] ) .",
    "the thing is that this theorem is equivalent to the addition method of calculation of the casimir force which leads to the error no larger than @xmath75% for small deviations from plane parallel geometry @xcite .",
    "what this means is that for a sphere or spherical lens of large curvature radius @xmath76 the additional error introduced by the use of pft is negligible .",
    "therefore it is possible to conclude that formulas like ( [ 24 ] ) , ( [ 29 ] ) and the analogical expressions for the other corrections to the casimir force can be reliably used for confronting theory and experiment at a level of 1% accuracy .",
