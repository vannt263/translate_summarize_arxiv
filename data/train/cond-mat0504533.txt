    "the study of correlated electron systems has attracted great interest over the last decades . much of this effort was devoted to simple hamiltonians that may contain the basic interactions to explain some properties of these systems .",
    "a common point of departure for many theoretical studies is the hubbard model@xcite which had been proposed to describe electron correlations in the narrow  band systems .",
    "this simple model has been extensively investigated over the past forty years , mostly in connection with the metal  insulator transition .",
    "after discovery of high temperature superconductors,@xcite it was argued@xcite that the same simple model could possibly capture some of the physics of these materials .",
    "the hubbard model is represented by the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) creates ( annihilates ) a conduction electron with spin @xmath3 at lattice site @xmath4 .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath5 is usually assumed to be non - zero for nearest neighboring sites @xmath4 and @xmath6 only .",
    "@xmath7 is the on  site coulomb interaction .",
    "although at first sight such a model may seem oversimplified , only few rigorous results are known .",
    "they include the one  dimensional solution through the bethe ansatz,@xcite the nagaoka s theorem@xcite and some statements which become exact in infinity dimensions.@xcite all other results are approximate ( mostly of mean  field or perturbative type ) or obtained for finite lattices , mainly by lanczs or quantum monte carlo ( mc ) calculations .",
    "therefore , our starting point is a simpler model , that can be viewed as a limiting case of a generalized ( asymmetric ) hubbard model . in the original hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] )",
    "the hopping integral @xmath8 is spin independent .",
    "however , one can assume that the mass of spin  up and spin  down electrons are different , and in the limit of infinitely massive spin  down electrons ,",
    "they localize and only spin  up ones occur in the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ hubbard ] ) .",
    "such an approximation to the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) was already used by hubbard.@xcite    denoting @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 by @xmath14 and @xmath15 by @xmath16 , the resulting hamiltonian reads @xmath17 here , @xmath16 is equal to 0 or 1 , according to whether the site @xmath4 is occupied or unoccupied by a massive particle .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ fk ] ) is known as the fk hamiltonian.@xcite within the framework of a common interpretation of the fk hamiltonian , there are two species of particles : itinerant electrons and classical localized particles .",
    "the classical particles have various physical interpretations : localized ( @xmath18 ) electrons , spin  down electrons , ions , impurities , nucleons . in the following",
    "we refer to them as `` ions '' .",
    "the ions interact on  site with electrons .",
    "there are no direct interactions neither between the electrons nor between the ions .",
    "however , the electron  ion coulomb interaction leads to an effective interaction between ions . as a result , for a given number of ions , the ground state energy depends on their distribution .",
    "the fk model has a long and successful history in dealing with correlated electron systems . introduced in 1969 to describe the metal ",
    "semiconductor transition in smb@xmath19 and related materials,@xcite has been also studied as a model of crystallization due to effective interactions mediated by band electrons,@xcite as a binary alloy model and many others .",
    "the fk model is also useful for describing systems that exhibit a phase separation@xcite and stripe formation.@xcite    the fk hamiltonian is over thirty five years old , or even older if one takes into account that hubbard used it in 1963 as an approximation to his model .",
    "however , while it is simpler than the hubbard model , the general solution is also not known . on the other hand",
    ", there is much more rigorous results for the fk model , then for the hubbard one .",
    "one of the most important , proved by kennedy and lieb,@xcite says that at low enough temperature the half  filled falicov  kimball model possesses a long range order , i.e. , the ions form a checkerboard pattern , the same as in the ground state .",
    "it is a phase , where the lattice can be divided into two interpenetrating sublattices a and b in such a way , that all nearest neighbors of a site from sublattice a belongs to sublattice b and _ vice versa _ and ions occupy only one of them .",
    "this result holds for arbitrary bipartite lattices in dimensions @xmath20 and for all values of the interaction strength @xmath7 .",
    "apart from this result not very much is known about solutions for two ",
    "dimensional systems.@xcite most of other results for the fk model concern one  dimension case @xcite or the infinite ",
    "dimensional limit.@xcite the present interest in this model was renewed in connection with developing new calculation methods that can be applied to the fk model .",
    "in particular , the dynamical mean ",
    "field theory@xcite ( dmft ) provides the exact solution of the fk model in infinite dimensions.@xcite while it is known that the dmft captures many key features of the fk model even in finite dimensions , this approach also has some limitations .",
    "the local approximation used in the dmft does not allow to incorporate any nonlocal correlations , which are necessary to describe many of phases that are expected to realize in the fk model .",
    "an extension to the dmft that include short  range dynamical correlations has been recently proposed.@xcite within this approach , called dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) , the `` impurity '' used in the dmft is replaced by a finite  size cluster .    at non  zero temperature",
    "the partition function has to be calculated for each ionic configuration , and then one has to average over the configurations ( `` annealing '' ) .",
    "however , since the number of ionic configurations increases very rapidly with the size of the system , such a procedure is possible in some cases only .",
    "one of them is called `` restricted phase diagram '' method,@xcite where only periodic configurations on infinite lattice are taken into account . in order to include _ all _ possible configurations ,",
    "one has to significantly restrict the size of the lattice .",
    "in such a case an exact diagonalization technique can be applied .",
    "@xcite this approach is particularly useful for low  dimensional systems , where the finite size effects are of relatively small importance .",
    "moreover , for linear chains it is possible to perform @xmath21 extrapolation in a systematic way . on the other hand ,",
    "it is difficult to perform the exact diagonalization studies at finite temperatures . in order to calculate the partition function",
    "one has to run a summation over @xmath22 ionic configurations .",
    "therefore , the maximum size of the clusters suitable for exact diagonalization study is strongly limited . in ref .",
    "the largest clusters consisted of 24 lattice sites .    in the present contribution we propose to avoid these limitations by using the mc method , where thermodynamic quantities for the fk model are determined by sampling the ionic configuration space stochastically .",
    "this approach allows us to investigate clusters of up to a few hundred sites .",
    "since the frozen particles are classical ones , we do not have to use the quantum mc algorithm with the `` fermionic sign '' problem , and thus the calculations are not restricted to the high  temperature regime .",
    "the present calculations are restricted to the neutral half  filled case , where the number of ions is equal to the number of electrons and their sum is equal to the number of lattice sites .",
    "the developed formalism can be straightforwardly used away from half  filling , however , the computational effort in this case is much larger , mainly due to the richness of the zero - temperature phase diagram of the fk model .",
    "nevertheless , some results for various concentrations have already been obtained.@xcite    the present simulations are performed on a square lattice .",
    "however , also in this aspect the generalization to other geometries is straightforward.@xcite    the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii describes the formalism .",
    "in particular , it is demonstrated there how the classical metropolis algorithm can be adopted to a system with both classical and quantum particles . in section iii",
    ", we analyze the order  disorder phase transition , especially in the small@xmath7 regime .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "that in this regime the fk model exhibits a first order phase transition . here",
    ", we analyze this possibility in detail .",
    "section iv is devoted to the dependence of the phase ",
    "temperature on the interaction @xmath7 .",
    "using temperature dependence of the specific heat and charge density wave ( cdw ) susceptibility we identify the critical temperature , constructing a phase diagram in the @xmath23 plane . in section",
    "v , we demonstrate how the long range order vanishes when the temperature increases .",
    "its temperature dependence is anomalous in a small@xmath7 limit .",

    "neighbor hopping .",
    "section vii presents the results for the density of states and spectral functions of the mobile particles .",
    "section viii contains our conclusions .",
    "in all simulations we have used the metropolis algorithm.@xcite our system contains classical ( ions ) as well as fermionic ( electrons ) degrees of freedom . the appropriate way to treat such a hamiltonian is to define the grand canonical partition function as @xmath24},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the hamiltonian ( [ fk ] ) for a fixed ionic configuration @xmath26 , @xmath27 indicates summation over ionic configurations , @xmath28 denotes the trace over fermionic degrees of freedom , @xmath29 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath30 is the operator for the total number of electrons . for a given ionic configuration the hamiltonian @xmath25 can be diagonalized numerically and the summation over fermionic degrees of freedom gives the partition function in the following form @xmath31 } \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 are eigenvalues of @xmath25 .",

    "as the electronic free energy @xmath35 depends on temperature , the corresponding hamiltonian , describing only the classical particles would include temperature  dependent interaction .",
    "this dependence may lead to nontrivial critical exponents .",
    "equation ( [ part ] ) indicates also , that in the metropolis algorithm we should use the electronic free energy in the statistical weights . to do this",
    ", however , one has to know the value of the chemical potential @xmath36 , and apart from specific cases ( e.g. , half  filling ) it has to be determined separately .",
    "since the calculations are carried out in the grand canonical ensemble , the chemical potential must be kept constant during the simulation .",
    "determining thermodynamic quantities , the averages are calculated with the statistical weights @xmath37 of corresponding ionic configurations @xmath26 .",
    "one of the advantages of the proposed approach is that it gives densities of states and spectral functions for the mobile particles that identically satisfy different sum rules .",
    "this will be discussed in sec .",
    "the calculations were carried out on clusters up to @xmath38 lattice sites , however , in most cases square clusters @xmath39 were used .",
    "usually , the simulations started at high temperature , with the initial state with randomly distributed ions .",
    "then , the temperature has been slowly decreased .",
    "below some temperature , ions started to form a checkerboard patterns .",
    "it is difficult to describe the process of pattern formation qualitatively . in some cases it is convenient to use @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the ion concentration in sublattice a ( b ) , as the order parameter .",
    "however , such a description is not well suitable for cluster calculations , since even in the case , when in the ground state ions form almost perfect checkerboard , @xmath43 can be close to zero .",
    "figure 1 presents an example of such a ionic configuration .",
    "is close to zero .",
    "filled circles represent sites occupied by the massive particles.,width=139 ]    a small staggered field can be introduced in order to prevent an occurrence of such effects . however , this `` phase smoothing out '' may restrict also some other configurations .",
    "instead , we use the density ",
    "density correlation function for the ions to describe the ordered state .",
    "it has the advantage that it is capable to describe long range as well as short range correlations .",
    "we define the correlation function in the following way : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 denotes unitary vectors along the @xmath48 and @xmath49 directions , respectively ( the lattice constant @xmath50 has been assumed ) .",
    "note , that @xmath51 describes correlations along the lattice axes .",
    "the correlation function @xmath51 describes ionic configuration only .",

    "density correlation function .",
    "this is a form especially convenient for the mc calculations @xmath55 where we used @xmath56 to indicate the average over generated ionic configurations .",

    "( [ fig7][fig9 ] ) , confirms the validity of the proposed approach as well .",
    "note , that these quantities are calculated in completely different ways : the specific heat is determined from the eigenvalues of the fermionic hamiltonian , whereas the cdw susceptibility from the correlation function of the classical particles .    in each simulation",
    "the ensemble averages of the thermodynamic quantities of interest are calculated after the system equilibrated .",
    "the thermalization period varies with temperature .",
    "in particular , it is very long at low temperatures or in the vicinity of critical points ( the critical slowdown ) . in order to determine whether the system has reached equilibrium , we usually start the simulation with two replicas of the system : one starting from a fully ordered state , the other from a random ion distribution .",
    "then , the energies of the systems evolve crossing each other after some number of mc steps .",
    "this point is considered as the beginning of equilibrium state and the averages of the thermodynamic quantities are calculated over the remaining mc steps .",
    "this procedure is especially useful close to the transition temperature .",
    "the width of the peak in the specific heat and in the cdw susceptibility decreases with the increase of the size of the system and a finite  size scaling should be carried out in order to determine precisely the transition temperature .",
    "this can be done , for instance , using the standard binder cumulant method.@xcite however , taking into account the huge amount of time needed to run the finite  size scaling over the whole parameter space , we have decided to omit to do it and most of the presented results have been obtained for 20 @xmath63 20 cluster .",
    "such a cluster is sufficiently large to produce results accurate enough to describe the properties of the model under investigation and , on the other hand , the time of a single simulation run is short enough to allow determination of the full phase diagram .",
    "moreover , some comparison of results obtained for 20 @xmath63 20 and 40 @xmath63 40 clusters is presented in section vii .",

    "weiss law @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the phase transition is of second order in this regime . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in refs . and , that in infinite dimensions in the small@xmath7 limit the order parameter has a strange non  bcs  like temperature dependence .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine precisely the nature of the phase transition in this regime .",
    "we have used a method proposed by m. challa _",
    "et al._@xcite to distinguish between first and second order phase transitions .",
    "systems undergoing first order phase transitions are accompanied by free energy barriers which separate the free energy minima characterizing the coexisting phases .",
    "it results in discontinuities in the first derivatives of the free energy , e.g. , the internal energy .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a @xmath70type singularity in the specific heat at the transition .    within the framework of metropolis",
    "mc approach the energy @xmath57 fluctuates with the probability distribution @xmath71 usually given by a gaussian .",
    "its width is proportional to the specific heat .",
    "however , if the system is close to the first order transition , the probability distribution @xmath71 is a superposition of two gaussians centered at different energies , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . here , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the energies in the high and low  temperature phases , respectively .",
    "the gaussians are weighted by the boltzmann factors of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and thus this splitting occurs in a vicinity of the transition temperature only . at higher ( lower ) temperatures @xmath71 forms a single gaussian centered at @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the energy distribution for temperatures slightly below and above the transition temperature for @xmath74 .",
    "since the data has a double  peak structure , the phase transition is of the first order .",
    "one can see the transfer of the weights from the low  temperature gaussian peak ( the lower panel in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) consists of a large number of peaks , clearly visible in the inset .",
    "they are connected with the discrete spectrum of the hamiltonian for a finite system .",
    "namely , at such a low temperature , there are only a few dislocations in the checkerboard ionic configuration . due the low concentration of the dislocations ,",
    "they are almost independent and each of them changes the energy by an approximately the same amount . in this way",
    ", two successive peaks correspond to configurations with the numbers of dislocations that differ by one . as the number of dislocations increases ,",
    "they start to `` feel '' each other , and the effective interactions smear out this energy ladder .",
    "this is why the peaks are visible only in the low  energy part of the distribution .",
    "of course , when the size of the lattice increases , the energy spectrum becomes quasicontinuous and the oscillations disappear .",

    "the results presented in fig .",
    "[ 20vs40 ] can be directly compared to results obtained using dynamical cluster approximation ( see fig . 6 in ref . ) .",
    "when the size of the cluster increases from 1@xmath631 ( what corresponds to the dynamical mean  field approximation ) to 8@xmath638 , some features start to develop in the dos .",
    "the positions of these features are almost the same as in our mc calculations , however , they are less developed .",
    "in particular , it seems that the dos at @xmath130 vanishes in infinite system and narrow peaks are located at @xmath131 slightly larger than @xmath132 . in ref . , these peaks are attributed to the localization of electrons in four sites surrounding each site occupied by an ion .",
    "however , these features , as well as the overall density of states , do not change when the temperature increases .",
    "moreover , the high  temperature density of states is exactly the same as the one for systems with random on  site binary disorder .",
    "both the peak and the ( pseudo)gap in the vicinity of @xmath133 have been obtained within many approaches to disordered binary alloys.@xcite this indicates that those peaks are rather connected with the strong interaction between electrons and randomly distributed ions .",
    "the temperature and interaction dependence of the density of states is connected with the spectral properties of the fk model .",

    "the dispersion relation is very accurately described by @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the energy of free electrons on a square lattice . with the increasing temperature the ionic disorder increases , destroying the checkerboard pattern . as a result ,",
    "the spectral peaks gradually broadens up filling the gap ( fig .",
    "[ spectr]b ) .",
    "however , due to the weakness of the electron  ion interaction , this broadening is relatively small .",
    "eventually , at high temperature the cdw gap disappears and the dispersion relation takes on the form of @xmath142 , that does not change with further increase of temperature ( fig . [",
    "spectr]c ) . in the strong interaction regime ( @xmath128 ) at low temperature the dispersion relation can be described by the same formula , as for @xmath62 . in this case , however , the stronger interaction leads to almost equal spectral weights in the lower and upper subband and the band structure does not resemble that for free electrons any more ( fig .",
    "[ spectr]d ) .",
    "when the ionic disorder increases , additional bands appear , mainly around @xmath143 and ( @xmath144 points ( fig . [ spectr]e ) .",
    "this effect is more visible in the corresponding dos ( fig .",
    "[ dos_largeu]b ) .",
    "these bands broaden up with farther increase of temperature and most of the spectral weight is transferred to them ( fig .",
    "[ spectr]f ) . despite the broadening , at point @xmath138",
    "there still exist flat parts of the bands , that are responsible for the peaks in the dos at energy @xmath133 .",
    "there exist some exact results for the mobile particles in the form of sum rules and the numerical results can be checked against them.@xcite they give values of a few lowest spectral moments , defined by @xmath145 their values in the half  filling case are given by very simple expressions @xmath146 it is interesting that the same results are valid for the hubbard model@xcite and for the fk model in a nonequilibrium state.@xcite since in the proposed approach the fk hamiltonian for a finite system is _ exactly _ diagonalized in each mc step , all these sum rules are _ exactly _ satisfied . as a result",
    "the sum rules are also satisfied for the spectral functions obtained in the whole mc run . however , the results for the moments are exact only if they are determined directly from the distribution of the eigenenergies in each mc step .",
    "the other approach , i.e. , integrating @xmath147 with the spectral function obtained in the whole mc run , leads to a small error introduced by the broadening of the dirac @xmath70 functions .",
    "the same holds true for the local moments,@xcite where @xmath147 is integrated with the density of states .",
    "we have presented monte carlo analysis of half  filled fk model . in order to take into account both the classical and fermionic degrees of freedom , we have derived a modification of the classical metropolis algorithm , where the interaction energy is replaced by free energy , calculated by numerical diagonalization of the fk hamiltonian for a given ionic configuration .",
    "such an approach is possible due to the absence of many  body interactions in the fk hamiltonian .",
    "although there is no many  body term in the hamiltonian , averaging over ionic configurations ( `` annealing '' ) leads to many ",
    "body effects in the fk model . as a result",
    ", the fk model possesses a rich phase diagram .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper concern the case of @xmath148 , i.e. , the case where the ground state is known to be the checkerboard ionic configuration .",
    "our results illustrate how the system reaches this state when the temperature is lowered .",
    "it is known , that in the strong interaction limit the fk model maps onto the ising model , and therefore the phase transition to the ordered state is of second order .",
    "there is no such a rigorous result for weakly interacting 2d fk model .",
    "our simulations indicate the presence of a first  order phase transition in this regime .",
    "however , the precise determination of the critical value of the interaction , below which the phase transition is of first order , requires extensive simulations , mostly in order to perform the finite  size scaling .",
    "additionally , we have shown that the order parameter decreases unusually with increasing temperature in this regime . a departure from the ising  type temperature dependence of the order parameter",
    "has recently been demonstrated also in infinite dimensions.@xcite    performing the mc simulations for various interaction strengths and at various temperatures , we have constructed the phase diagram for half  filled fk model .",
    "it was shown , that the boundary line , separating the ordered ( checkerboard ) and disordered phases , determined from positions of the peaks in the specific heat and in the cdw susceptibility coincides with the one obtained from the opening of a gap in the electronic dos .",
    "the phase diagram has also been determined in the presence of nnn hopping .",
    "it was shown , that there is a point ( for @xmath149 , depending on the interaction strength ) at which no long range order exists at any finite temperature . for larger @xmath95 the ions at low temperate form horizontal or vertical stripes .",
    "the electronic dos and spectral functions have been determined for a wide range of the interaction strength . in the large@xmath7 limit",

    ", the cdw gap develops in the dos at low temperatures . at high temperatures ,",
    "the ions are distributed randomly over the lattice sites and the electronic dos is the same as in a free electron system with a diagonal disorder . on the other hand , in the weak interaction regime",
    "the electrons are hardly affected by the ions , and averaging over the ionic configurations leads to the same band structure as for free electrons on a square lattice .",
    "we have shown , that the proposed approach give both the electronic dos and spectral functions in a good agreement with that obtained with use of much more elaborated dca method , whereas the computational effort is much lower .",

    "<S> we construct the phase diagram of half  filled fk model . </S>",
    "<S> also , the role of next  nearest  neighbor hopping on the phase diagram is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we discuss the density of states and the spectral functions for the mobile particles in weak and strong interaction regime . </S>"
