    "bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) was first observed in 1995 in atomic vapors of @xmath0rb  @xcite , @xmath1li  @xcite and @xmath2na  @xcite .",
    "typically , the gas of atoms is confined by a magnetic trap  @xcite , and cooled by laser and evaporative means .",
    "although the basic theory for the condensation was known from the classical works of bose  @xcite and einstein  @xcite , the experiments on bec stimulated new theoretical work in the field ( an excellent review of this material is given in  @xcite ) .",
    "a lot of theoretical results about condensate dynamics are based on the assumption that the condensate band can be characterized by some temperature @xmath3 and chemical potential @xmath4 , the quantities which are clearly defined only for gases in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "often , however , the condensation is so rapid that the gas is in a very nonequilibrium state and hence , one requires the use of a kinetic rather than a thermodynamic theory @xcite .",
    "an approach using the quantum kinetic equation was developed by gardiner et al @xcite who used some phenomenological assumptions about the scattering amplitudes .",
    "phenomenology is unavoidable in the general case due to an extreme dynamical complexity of quantum gases the atoms in which interact among themselves and exhibit wave - particle dualism .",
    "most phenomenological assumptions are intuitive or arise from a physical analogy and are hard to validate ( or to prove wrong ) theoretically .",
    "in particular , it was proposed that the ground bec states act onto the higher levels via an effective potential . in the present paper we are going to examine this assumption in a special case of large occupation numbers , i.e. when the system is more like a collection of interacting waves rather than particles and which allows a systematic theoretical treatment . in what follows",
    "we show _ systematically _ that such an assumption is not true for such systems . for dilute gases , with a large number of atoms at low temperatures , one obtains the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the condensate order parameter  @xcite : @xmath5 where the potential @xmath6 is a given function of coordinate ,",
    "see for example figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we emphasize that the area of validity of gp equation is restricted to a narrow class of the low - temperature bec growth experiments and the latest stages in other bec experiments .",
    "however , we will study the gp equation because it provides an important limiting case for which one can rigorously test the phenomenological assumptions made for more general systems",
    ". we would like to abandon the approach where the system is artificially divided into a @xmath7 condensate state and a thermal `` cloud '' because this `` cloud '' in reality is far from the thermodynamic equilibrium and we believe that this fact affects the bec dynaimcs in an essential way .",
    "as in many other non - equilibrium and turbulent systems , fluxes of the conserved quantities through the phase space are more relevant for the theory here than the temperature and the chemical potential .",
    "performance of a thermodynamic theory here would be as poor as a description of waterfalls by a theory developed for lakes .",
    "again , the gp equation is used in our work for both the ground and the excited states which limits our analysis only to the low temperature and high occupation number situations .",
    "in fact the idea of using gp equation for describing bec kinetics is not new and it goes back to work of kagan et al @xcite , who used a kinetic equation for waves systematically derived from the gp equation ignoring the trapping potential and assuming turbulence to be spatially homogeneous @xcite .",
    "a similar method has been used to investigate optical turbulence @xcite .",
    "classical weak turbulence theory yields a closed kinetic equation for the long time behavior of the energy spectrum without having to make unjustifiable assumptions about the statistics of the processes @xcite .",
    "second , the kinetic equation admits classes of _ exact _ equilibrium solutions @xcite . these can be identified as pure kolmogorov spectra @xcite , namely equilibria for which there is a constant spectral flux of one of the invariants , the energy , @xmath8 \\ ,",
    "d { \\bf x},\\ ] ] and the `` number of particles '' , @xmath9 a very important property of the particle cascade is that it transfers the particles to the small @xmath10 values ( inverse cascade ) .",
    "this transfer will lead to an accumulation at small @xmath10 s which is precisely the mechanism of the be condensation , see figure 1 .",
    "the energy cascade is toward high values of @xmath10 which eventually will lead to `` spilling '' over the potential barrier corresponding to an evaporative cooling , see figure 1 .",
    "after the formation of strong condensate one can no longer use weak turbulence theory , as the weak turbulence theory assumes small amplitudes .",
    "however , one can reformulate the theory using a linearization around the condensate , ( as oppose to linearization around the @xmath11 state ) , as in @xcite .",
    "consequently this changes the dominant system interactions from 4-wave to 3-wave processes .     and particle number @xmath12 .",
    "]    kolmogorov - type energy distributions over the levels ( scales ) are dramatically different from any thermodynamic equilibrium distributions .",
    "thus , the condensation and the cooling rates will also be significantly different from those obtained from theories based on the assumptions of a thermodynamic equilibrium and the existence of a boltzmann distribution .",
    "as an example , a finite - time condensation was predicted by kagan , svistunov and shlyapnikov  @xcite , whose work was based on the theory of weak homogeneous turbulence .",
    "however , application of the theory of homogeneous turbulence to the gp equation has its limitations .",
    "indeed , when the external potential is not ignored in the gp equation , the turbulence is trapped and is , therefore , intrinsically inhomogeneous ( e.g. a turbulent spot ) .",
    "additional inhomogeneity of the turbulence arises because of the condensate , which in the gp equation case is itself coordinate dependent .",
    "this means , in particular , that the theory of homogeneous turbulence can not describe the ground state effect onto the confining properties of the gas and thereby test the effective potential approach .",
    "the present paper is aimed at removing this pitfall via deriving an inhomogeneous weak turbulence theory .",
    "the effects of the coordinate dependent potential and condensate can most easily be understood using a wavepacket ( wkb ) formalism that is applicable if the wavepacket wavelength @xmath13 is much shorter than the characteristic width of the potential well @xmath14 , @xmath15 the coordinate dependent potential and the condensate distort the wavepackets so that their wavenumbers change .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on nonlinear resonant wave interactions because now waves can only be in resonance for a finite time .",
    "the goal of our paper is to use the ideas developed for the gp equation without the trapping potential and to combine them with the wkb formalism in order to derive a weak turbulence theory for a large set of random waves described by the gp equation .",
    "note that idea to combine the kinetic equation with wkb to describe weakly nonlinear dynamics of wave ( or quantum ) excitations is quite old and can be traced back to khalatnikov s theory of bose gas ( 1952 ) and landau s theory of the fermi fluids ( 1956 ) , see e.g. in @xcite .",
    "it has also been widely used to describe kinetics of waves in plasmas , e.g. @xcite .",
    "for plasmas , such a formalism was usually derived from the first principles . however , only phenomenological models based on an experimentally measured dispersion curves have been proposed so far for the superfluid kinetics . in this paper",
    ", we offer for the first time a consistent derivation starting from the gp equation which allows us to correct the existing bec phenomenology at least for the special cases when the gp equation is applicable .",
    "technically , the most nontrivial new element of our theory appears through the linear dynamics ( wkb ) whereas modifications of the nonlinear part ( the collision integral ) are fairly straightforward . thus , we start with a detailed consideration of the linear dynamics in section [ sec2 ] . previously , linear excitations to the ground state were considered by fetter @xcite who used a test function approach to derive an approximate dispersion relation for these excitations .",
    "fetter pointed out an uncertainty of the boundary conditions to be used at the ground state reflection surface .",
    "the wkb theory for bec which is for the first time developed in the present paper allows an asymptotically rigorous approach which , among other things , allows to clarify the role of the ground state reflection surface .",
    "indeed , as we will see in section 3 , the wkb theory is essentially different in the case when the condensate ground state is weak and can be neglected from the case of strongly nonlinear ground state .",
    "no suitable wkb description exists for the intermediate case in which the linear and the nonlinear effects are of the same order .",
    "however , in the thomas - fermi regime the layer of the intermediate condensate amplitudes is extremely narrow due to the exponential decay of the amplitude beyond the ground state reflection surface .",
    "this allowed us to combine the two wkb descriptions into one by formally re - writing the equations in such a way that they are correct in the limits of both weak and strong condensate .",
    "these equations will be wrong in the thin layer of intermediate condensate amplitudes , but this will not have any effect on the overall dynamics of wavepackets because they pass this layer too quickly to be affected by it .    in section 4 for the first time we present a hamiltonian formulation of the wkb equations and derive a cannonical hamiltonian the form of which is general for all wkb systems and not only bec .",
    "the hamiltonian formulation is needed to prepare the scene for the weak turbulence theory . in section 5",
    "we apply weak turbulence theory to write a closed kinetic equation for wave action .",
    "this kinetic equation has a coordinate dependence of the frequency delta functions .",
    "notice that coordinate dependence of the wave frequency has a profound effect on the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the resonant wave interactions can now take place only over a limited range of wave trajectories which makes such interactions similar to the collision of discrete particles .",
    "we will now develop a wkb theory for small - scale wave - packets , described by a linearized gp equation , with and without the presence of a background condensate . as is traditional with any wkb - type method we assume the existence of a scale separation @xmath16 , as explained in section [ sec1 ] . in this analysis",
    "we will take @xmath17 so that any spatial derivatives of a given large - scale quantity ( e.g. the potential @xmath6 or the condensate ) are of order @xmath18 .",
    "the transition to wkb phase - space is achieved through the application of the gabor transform @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an arbitrary function fastly decaying at infinity . for our purposes it will be sufficient to consider a gaussian of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of space dimensions . the parameter @xmath23 is small and such that @xmath24 .",
    "hence , our kernel @xmath20 varies at the intermediate - scale .",
    "a gabor transform can therefore be thought of as a localized fourier transform , and in the limit @xmath25 becomes an exact fourier transform .",
    "physically , one can view a gabor transform as a wavepacket distribution function over positions @xmath26 and wavevectors @xmath27 .",
    "linearizing the gp equation , to investigate the behavior of wavepackets @xmath28 without the presence of a condensate , we obtain the usual linear schrdinger equation : @xmath29 where @xmath6 is a slowly varying potential .",
    "let us apply the gabor transformation to ( [ lgpenc ] ) .",
    "note that the gabor transformation commutes with the laplacian , so that @xmath30 . also note that @xmath31 where we have neglected the quadratic and higher order terms in @xmath32 because @xmath33 changes on a much shorter scale than the large scale function @xmath6 . combining",
    "the gabor transformed equation with its complex conjugate we find the following wkb transport equation , @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the total time derivative along the wavepacket trajectories in phase - space .",
    "the ray equations are used to describe wavepacket trajectories in @xmath36 phase - space ,",
    "@xmath37 the frequency @xmath38 , in this case , is given by @xmath39 , ( again we use the notation @xmath40 ) .",
    "equations ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ rays ] ) are nothing more than the famous _",
    "ehrenfest _ theorem from quantum mechanics . according to ( [ rays ] ) ,",
    "the wavepackets will get reflected by the potential at points @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "we will now move on to consider linear wavepackets in the presence of a background condensate .",
    "one of the common assumptions in the bec theory is that the presence of a condensate acts on the higher levels by just modifying the confining potential @xmath6 , see for example  @xcite .",
    "if this was the case , the linear dynamics would still be described by the _",
    "ehrenfest _ theorem with some new effective potential .",
    "we will show below that this is not the case .",
    "let us define the condensate @xmath43 as a nonlinear coordinate dependent solution of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , with a lengthscale of the order of the ground state size ( although it does not need to be exactly the same as the ground state ) . in what follows , we will use madelung s amplitude - phase representation for @xmath43 , namely @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the macroscopic speed of the condensate .",
    "it is well known that in this representation @xmath46 obeys a continuity equation , @xmath47 for future reference , one should note that the second term in this expression is @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 is @xmath48 too and it must be neglected in the wkb theory which takes into account only linear in @xmath32 terms .",
    "we start by considering a small perturbation @xmath50 , such that @xmath51 substituting ( [ yurisubstitution ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) we find @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a slowly varying condensate density .    in a similar manner to the previous subsection , the rest of this derivation consists of gabor transforming ( [ eq3 ] ) , combining the result with its complex conjugate and finding a suitable waveaction variable such that the transport equation represents a conservation equation along the rays .",
    "such a derivation is given in appendix a. it yields to the following expression for the waveaction , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 mean the real and imaginary parts respectively . as usual , the transport equation takes the form of a conservation equation for waveaction along the rays , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the time derivative along trajectories @xmath59 the frequency is given by the following expression , @xmath60 one can immediately recognize in ( [ omcondensate ] ) the bogolubov s formula @xcite which was derived before for systems with a coordinate independent condensate and without a trapping potential .",
    "it is remarkable that presence of the potential @xmath6 does not affect the frequency so that expression ( [ omcondensate ] ) remains the same .",
    "obviously , the dynamics in this case can not be reduced to the _ ehrenfest _ theorem with any shape of potential @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , an approach that models a condensate s effect by introducing a renormalized potential would be misleading in this case .",
    "[ fig2 ]        in this section we will investigate the applicability of the above theory . let us consider a condensate which is a solution of the eigenvalue problem @xmath61 . therefore , the gp equation ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes @xmath62      firstly , let us consider the case of a weak condensate so that the effect of the nonlinear term is small in comparison to the linear ones , @xmath63 . since @xmath64 is a constant we observe that the laplacian term acts to balance the external potential term ( like in the linear schrdinger equation ) and the nonlinear term can be , at most , as big as the linear ones @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the characteristic size of the condensate ( it is defined as the condensate reflection ",
    "point via the condition @xmath67 , see below ) .",
    "now for a wkb description to be valid we require @xmath68 , i.e. we require the characteristic length - scale of our wavepackets to be a lot smaller than that of the large - scales .",
    "using this fact we find @xmath69 therefore , the condensate correction to the frequency , given by ( [ omcondensate ] ) , is small . in other words",
    "the wavepacket does not feel  the condensate .",
    "indeed , from @xmath70 we have @xmath71 and this implies that @xmath72 ( where @xmath41 is the wavepacket reflection point , see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , the condensate in this case occupies a tiny space at the bottom of the potential well and hence does not affect a wavepacket s motion .",
    "therefore , a wavepacket moves as a classical  particle described by the _ ehrenfest _ equations ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ rays ] ) .",
    "in fact , in this case it would be incorrect to try to describe the small condensate corrections via our wkb approach because these corrections are of order @xmath73 ( the @xmath74 terms being ignored in a wkb description ) .",
    "now we will consider a strong condensate such that @xmath75 i.e. the @xmath76 dependence of the potential @xmath6 is now balanced by the nonlinearity .",
    "this is usually referred to as the _ thomas - fermi _ limit  @xcite .",
    "wavepackets now feel  the presence of a strong condensate if @xmath77 .",
    "we see that the wkb approach is applicable because @xmath78 according to the ray equations @xmath38 is a constant along a wavepacket s trajectory , so we can find the packet s wavenumber from @xmath79 .",
    "one can see that @xmath80 remains positive for any value of @xmath81 which means that the presence of the condensate does not lead to any new wavepacket reflection points ( i.e. when @xmath10 takes a value of zero ) .",
    "thus , turbulence is allowed to penetrate into the center of the potential well .",
    "however , the group velocity increases when the condensate becomes stronger , @xmath82 .",
    "this means that the density of wavepackets decreases toward the center of well .",
    "therefore , the condensate tends to push the turbulence away from the center , toward the edges of the potential trap .",
    "to summarize , in the presence of a strong condensate we have two regions of applicability for our wkb descriptions , see figure 2 .",
    "wavepackets at a position @xmath83 , in the central region of the potential well will evolve according to the wkb - condensate description ( [ wacconden ] ) - ( [ omcondensate ] ) .",
    "the laplacian term only becomes important for @xmath84 where @xmath81 is exponentially small . in this case",
    "the ehrenfest description is appropriate .",
    "it will be shown in the next section that these two wkb descriptions can be combined into a single set of formulae .",
    "it is interesting that taking the limit of zero condensate amplitude in the waveaction ( [ wacconden ] ) results in the waveaction @xmath85 of the ehrenfest equation ( [ phi ] ) which corresponds to the regime without condensate , @xmath86 on the other hand , @xmath87 which is different from the ehrenfest expression @xmath88 .",
    "thus , one can not recover the non - condensate ( ehrenfest ) description by just taking the limit of zero condensate amplitude in ( [ wacconden ] ) , ( [ wcondensatewkb ] ) and ( [ omcondensate ] ) .",
    "however , one can easily write a unified wkb description which will be valid with or without condensate by simply adding @xmath89 to the frequency ( [ omcondensate ] ) . indeed , for strong condensate @xmath89=const and , therefore , it does not alter the ray equations ( which contain only derivatives of @xmath38 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such an addition allows us to obtain the correct expression @xmath90 in the limit @xmath91 . summarizing",
    ", we write the following equations of the linear wkb theory which are valid with or without the presence of a condensate , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the waveaction and @xmath94 is the full time derivative along trajectories and @xmath95 are the ray equations with @xmath96 formula ( [ omcondensateu ] ) is an important and nontrivial result which can be obtained neither from existing general facts about the wbk formalism nor from the linear theory of homogeneous systems .",
    "the derivation for the description of the nonuniform turbulence found in a bec system consists of a amalgamation of a wkb method , for the description of the linear dynamics , and a standard weak turbulence theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) , with the noted modification that gabor transforms are used instead of fourier ones .",
    "we will now demonstrate the general ideas of such a derivation for the simple case of system where no condensate is present .",
    "consider the gabor transformation of ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath97 to calculate the @xmath98 term let us first separate the gabor transform into its correspondingly fast and slow spatial parts , @xmath99 now by using the inverse gabor transform @xmath100 we find @xmath101 note that the slow amplitudes @xmath102 do not change much over the characteristic width of the function @xmath20 and hence their argument @xmath103 can be replaced by @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , we can approximate ( [ stuff1 ] ) by @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the fourier transform of @xmath107 .",
    "note that for the spatially homogeneous systems , @xmath25 , @xmath106 is just a delta function , @xmath108 after dropping terms proportional to @xmath109 , equation ( [ eq1gabor ] ) then becomes @xmath110 this is the master equation formulating the nonlinear dynamics in terms of the gabor amplitudes .",
    "this can serve as a starting point for the statistical averaging which in turn leads to the weak turbulence formalism .",
    "note that this equation can be written in hamiltonian form , @xmath111 with a hamiltonian function @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , such a hamiltonian description can be derived directly , in terms of the gabor amplitudes , from the hamiltonian formulation of the original gp equation ( see appendix b ) .",
    "if a condensate is present in the system , one can also re - write the equations in a hamiltonian form with an identical quadratic part .",
    "that is , with @xmath102 being replaced by the normal amplitude , and @xmath38 by the frequency of waves , found in the presence of the condensate .",
    "it appears that the quadratic part of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is generic in the wkb context .",
    "indeed , let us consider a typical hamiltonian for linear waves in weakly inhomogeneous media @xcite expressed in terms of fourier amplitudes @xmath114 and @xmath115 @xmath116 with a hermitian kernel @xmath117 which is strongly peaked at @xmath118 .",
    "as we will show in a separate paper @xcite , this hamiltonian can be represented in terms of the gabor transforms as @xmath119 where @xmath120 are the gabor coefficients , and @xmath121 is the position dependent frequency , related to @xmath122 via _ , = e^- 2 i ( , + 2 ) d .",
    "actually , such an expression is a canonical form , even for a much broader class of hamiltonians that correspond to a significant class of linear equations with coordinate dependent coefficients @xcite .",
    "that is , = d * q * d * q_1 * , [ genhamiltonian ] where functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 peaked at @xmath118 .",
    "now , by analogy with homogeneous weak turbulence , we define the waveaction spectrum as @xmath125 where averaging is performed over the random initial phases . note that this definition is slightly different to the usual definition of the turbulence spectrum in homogeneous turbulence , i.e. the definition constructed from fourier transforms , @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , a gabor transform can be viewed as a finite - box fourier transform , where @xmath127 in the definition of the spectrum and one replaces @xmath128 with the box volume @xmath129 .    multiplying ( [ morestuff2 ] ) by @xmath130 and combining the resulting equation with its complex conjugate",
    ", we get a generalization of ( [ phi ] ) : @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "note , that in the case of homogeneous turbulence , using the random phase assumption , in the above equation , would lead to the rhs becoming zero .",
    "this means that the nontrivial kinetic equation appears only in higher orders of the nonlinearity . for the inhomogeneous case",
    ", the nontrivial effect of the nonlinearity appears even at this ( second ) order .",
    "this can be seen via a frequency correction which , in turn , modifies the wave trajectories .",
    "this effect was considered by zakharov et al @xcite and it is especially important in systems where such frequency corrections result in modulational instabilities followed by collapsing events . in our case",
    "the nonlinearity is `` defocusing '' and , therefore , such an effect is less important . indeed , in what follows we will neglect this effect as , at sufficiently small ratios of the inhomogeneity and turbulence intensity parameters , @xmath133",
    ", wave collision events are a far more dominant process .",
    "let us introduce notations @xmath134 and @xmath135 then , we have the following equation for the 4th - order moment , @xmath136 where we denote @xmath137 .",
    "note that the first two terms on the rhs of this equation can be obtained one from another by exchanging @xmath138 and @xmath139 , whereas the last two terms  by exchanging @xmath140 and @xmath141 . to solve this equation , one can use the _ random phase assumption _ which is standard for the derivation of a weak _ homogeneous _ turbulence theory and which allows one to express the 6th - order moment in terms of the 2nd - order correlators . for homogeneous turbulence ,",
    "the validity of this assumption was examined by newell et al @xcite who showed that initially gaussian turbulence ( characterized by random independent phases ) remains gaussian for the energy cascade range whereas in the particle cascade range deviations from gaussianity grow toward low @xmath10 values .",
    "however , these deviations remain small over a large range of @xmath10 for small initial amplitudes and the random phase assumption can be used for these scales .",
    "note that the deviations from gaussianity at low @xmath10 correspond to the physical process of building a coherent condensate state .",
    "the results of @xcite obtained for homogeneous gp turbulence will hold for trapped turbulence too because inhomogeneity has a neutral effect on the phase correlations . indeed , according to the linear wkb equations the phases propagate unchanged along the rays .",
    "thus we write @xmath142 here we have used the shorthand notations , @xmath143 and @xmath144 . using this expression in ( [ ef4 m ] ) we have @xmath145 notice that the @xmath146 terms get replaced by @xmath147 , since the @xmath148 terms drop out on the resonant manifold .",
    "let us integrate this equation over the period @xmath3 which is less than both the slow wkb time @xmath149 and the nonlinear time @xmath150 .",
    "then , one can ignore the time dependence in @xmath151 on the rhs of the above equation and we can take on the lhs .",
    "the resulting equation can be easily integrated along the characteristics ( rays ) which in the limit @xmath152 gives @xmath153 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{fourordercorrelator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that to derive a similar expression in the theory of _ homogeneous _ weak turbulence one usually introduces an artificial `` dissipation '' to circumvent the pole and to get the correct sign in front of the delta function ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the roots of this problem can be found even at the level of the linear dynamics , where the use of laplace ( rather than fourier ) transforms provides a mathematical justification for the introduction of such a dissipation .",
    "however , in our case there is no need for us to introduce such a dissipation because inhomogeneity removes the degeneracy in the system . substituting ( [ fourordercorrelator ] ) into ( [ generalizationofphi ] )",
    "we get the main equation describing weak turbulence , the four - wave kinetic equation @xmath154 where , @xmath155 we can see that the main difference between the kinetic equation for inhomogeneous media and homogeneous turbulence @xcite is that the partial time derivative on the lhs is replaced by the full time derivative along the rays .",
    "further , the frequency @xmath38 and spectrum @xmath156 are now functions not only of the wavenumber but also of the coordinate .",
    "the same is true for the case when the ground state condensate is important for the wave dynamics @xcite .",
    "the main interaction mechanism now become three wave interactions , with the kinetic equation @xmath157 where @xmath158 . here , @xmath151 , @xmath159 and @xmath38 are given by expressions ( [ waccondenu ] ) , ( [ fdar ] ) and ( [ omcondensateu ] ) respectively and the expression for the interaction coefficient @xmath160 can be found in @xcite .",
    "three - wave interactions always dominate over the four - wave process when @xmath161 ( because @xmath162 and @xmath163 . in the case",
    "@xmath164 , the relative importance of the three - wave and the four - wave processes can be established by comparing the characteristic times associated with these processes .",
    "the characteristic time of the three wave interactions for @xmath164 is @xmath165 thus , the 3-wave process will dominate the 4-wave one if the condensate is stronger than the waves , i.e. if @xmath166 .",
    "in this paper , we developed a theory of weak inhomogeneous wave turbulence for bec systems .",
    "we started with the gp equation and derived a statistical theory for the bec kinetics which , in particular , describes states which are very far from the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "such nonequilibrium states take the form of wave turbulence which is essentially inhomogeneous due to the fact that the bec is trapped by an external field .",
    "there are two main new results in this paper .",
    "first of all , we have described the effect of the inhomogeneous ground state on the linear wave dynamics and , in particular , we have shown that such an effect can not be modeled by renormalizing the trapping potential as it was previously suggested in literature .",
    "this was done by deriving a consistent wkb theory based on the scale separation between the ground state and the waves .",
    "our results show that the condensate `` mildly '' pushes the wave turbulence away from the center but it can never reflect it ( as an external potential would ) .",
    "note that we established this result only for the limit of large occupation numbers described by the gp equation and this , in principle , does not rule out a possibility that the the renormalized potential approach can still be valid in the opposite limit of small occupation numbers .",
    "secondly , we showed that the kinetic equation for trapped waves generalizes , and one can combine the linear wkb theory and the theory of homogeneous weak turbulence in a straightforward manner .",
    "namely , the partial time derivative on the lhs of the kinetic equation is replaced by the full time derivative along the wave rays , while the frequency and the spectrum on the rhs now become functions of coordinate .",
    "a suitable definition for the coordinate dependent spectrum is given by using the gabor transforms instead of fourier transforms .",
    "it is important to notice that the coordinate dependence of the wave frequency has a profound effect on the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the resonant wave interactions can now take place only over a limited range of wave trajectories which makes such interactions similar to the collision of discrete particles .",
    "similarly to the case of homogeneous turbulence considered in @xcite , the presence of a condensate changes the resonant wave    interactions from four - wave to three - wave if the condensate intensity exceeds that of the waves .",
    "a distinct feature of the inhomogeneous turbulence trapped by a potential is that if the three - wave regime is dominant in the center of the potential well , it is likely to be suddenly replaced by a four - wave dynamics when one moves out of the center beyond the condensate reflection points where the condensate intensity is decaying exponentially fast .",
    "thus the same wavepacket can alternate between three - wave and four - wave interactions , with other wavepackets , as it travels back and forth between its reflection points in the potential well .",
