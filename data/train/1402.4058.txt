    "there are a number of approaches to understanding and describing processes in human mind .",
    "they belong to different levels of abstraction , ranging from neural and biochemical processes in the brain up to philosophical constructions , and study its different aspects . in the present work we focus our attention on the phenomenological ( psychological ) description of human memory dealing with it as a whole , i.e. , without reducing the corresponding mental functions to the real physiological processes implementing them . a review of advances made in this scope during the last decades can be found in a monograph by @xcite who inspired the development of the act - r concept in cognitive science , a modern theory about how human cognition works .",
    "the act - r theory operates with three types of human memory , sensory , short - term , and long - term ones @xcite and accepts , in particular , the following basic postulates .    _",
    "first _ , the declarative ( long - term ) memory is organized in chunks @xcite , certain cognitive units related to some information objects . at the first approximation the learning , memorizing , and retrieval of a given object proceeds via the creation and evolution of the corresponding chunk .",
    "naturally , chunks can interact with one another , in particular , forming larger composed chunks and , finally , their hierarchical network .",
    "the notion of chunk is general , therefore , it is rather problematic to define it more precisely , for discussion and history see , e.g. , a review by @xcite .    _",
    "second _ , each chunk individually is characterized by its strength @xmath0 which determines also the information retention , namely , the probability of successful retrieval of the corresponding information from a given chunk @xcite . since the classical experiments of @xcite a rather big data - set about the retention ability of human memory has been accumulated for time scales from several minutes up to a few weeks .",
    "it has been figured out that the memory strength @xmath0 decays with time @xmath1 according to the power - law @xcite , i.e. , exhibits the asymptotic behavior @xmath2 where the exponent @xmath3 is a certain constant .",
    "it should be noted that , in general , this dependence meets the second jost s law , the increment of the strength decay becomes weaker as time goes on ( see , e.g. , a review by @xcite ) .",
    "appealing at least to the data - set collected by @xcite and analyzed by @xcite as well as one collected and studied by @xcite the exponent @xmath3 seems to be rather universal and can be estimated as @xmath4 .",
    "the _ third _ postulate concerns the multiple - trace arrangement of human memory .",
    "it assumes that each attempt of learning and memorizing some information fragment produces a separate trace @xmath5 in human memory .",
    "so the corresponding cognitive unit , a chunk , is actually a collection @xmath6 of many memory traces and its strength @xmath0 is the sum of their individual activation levels @xmath7",
    "@xcite @xmath8 evidence collected currently in physiology ( see , e.g. , work by @xcite and references therein ) partly supports this concept . its implementation in physiological terms is reduced to the multiple trace theory ( mtt ) developed by @xcite appealing to the role of the hippocampus in the encoding of new memory traces as well as the retrieval of all the previous traces , including remote ones . the preceding alternative of mtt is the standard model of systems consolidation ( smsc : @xcite ) .",
    "it assumes the hippocampus to `` teach '' the cortex a memory trace strengthening the connectivity between its individual elements over time and , finally , consolidating the memory .",
    "recently @xcite have proposed a competitive trace theory ( ctt ) combining elements smsc and mtt .",
    "it suggests that when a memory is reactivated by a new cue , the hippocampus acts to re - instantiate the original memory traces , recombine their elements in the episodic memory , and add or subtract individual contextual features . as a result ,",
    "a new memory trace overlapping with the original ones is created and ready to be stored in the neocortex . however , in contrast to mtt , ctt supposes that the memory traces are not stored in parallel but compete for representation in the neocortex .",
    "two relative phenomena occur here : consolidation and decontextualization .",
    "first , overlapping features in the memories should not compete for representation and thus are strengthened , i.e. , consolidated .",
    "second , non - overlapping features should compete with one another resulting in mutual inhibition and , as a result , memories become decontextualized . @xcite proposed the reactivation of memory traces to strengthen also the links between the traces too .",
    "the concept of such a multi - trace consolidation can be regarded as the _ fourth _ postulate of the act - r theory .    as the _ fifth",
    "_ postulate we note the following .",
    "the hippocampus is involved in the `` reconstruction '' rather than the `` retrieval '' of the memory .",
    "so , as ctt states , new memory traces are only partially but not completely overlap with the original traces .",
    "it is due to the hippocampus capability of supporting rapid encoding of unique experiences by orthogonalizing incoming inputs such that their interference is minimized , which is termed pattern separation ; the available evidence for this feature was recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "this pattern separation together with the corresponding pattern completion via creating new memory traces endows our episodic memory system with richness , associativity , and flexibility @xcite .    _ finally",
    "_ , the act - r theory accepts an important generalization about expansion  .",
    "it assumes that the individual activation levels @xmath9 of memory traces decreases with time @xmath1 also according to the power law and , after formation , their individual dynamics is mutually independent .",
    "thereby the strength @xmath10 of the corresponding chunk is the superposition @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are some constants and @xmath13 is the time moment when the chunk @xmath14 was created .",
    "it should be noted that expression   does not take into account the chunk interaction .",
    "our following constructions will be based on these postulates . in the present work",
    "we will confine our consideration to the dynamics of a single chunk and ignore the effects of memory consolidation which are likely to be crucial only on relatively large time scales .",
    "mathematical description of the chunk interaction and the memory consolidation are challenging problems on their own and require individual investigation .",
    "a chunk @xmath15 is considered to be a collection of traces @xmath16 created in the working memory at time moments @xmath17 and stored in the declarative ( long - term ) memory .",
    "these traces will be also called slides for reasons apparent below .",
    "let us assume that the chunk @xmath15 as a whole contains a certain fragment of information , a pattern @xmath18 , so all its slides retain different fragments of this pattern .",
    "the time evolution of the chunk @xmath15 as a whole unit is described in terms of its strength @xmath10 , the measure of the relative volume of the pattern pieces that are retrievable at the current moment of time @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the individual evolution of the slides @xmath16 is characterized by similar quantities @xmath19 depending on the current time @xmath1 and the time @xmath20 when the corresponding slide was created and stored .",
    "the chunk slides are assumed to be created according to the following scenario illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "memory continuously looses some fragments of the pattern @xmath18 .",
    "so when at the current moment of time @xmath1 the chunk @xmath15 as a whole is retrieved from the declarative memory only some its fragment @xmath21 can be retrieved , which is characterized by the value @xmath22 .",
    "then addition practice or learning is necessary to reconstruct the initial pattern @xmath18 .",
    "therefore a new slide @xmath23 to be created during this action has to contain , at least , the fragment @xmath24 . in principle",
    ", the pattern fragment @xmath25 to be stored in @xmath23 can include other fragments of the initial pattern @xmath18 .",
    "so in a more general case the condition @xmath26 may hold , which is worthy of individual investigation . in the present work we confine our consideration to the limit case",
    "where    [ mod:1 ] @xmath27 if the current learning action is enough to create the fragment @xmath23 containing @xmath25 .",
    "however , there could be a situation when the time interval @xmath28 of the learning process before the slide @xmath23 to be transfered to the declarative memory is not enough to do this .",
    "under such conditions we assume that before transferring the slide @xmath23 to the declarative memory it is cut off , i.e. , its capacity for new information is reduced and the saved pattern fragment meets the condition @xmath29    in both the cases it is reasonable to measure the capacity @xmath30 of the new slide based on the current strength @xmath10 of the chunk @xmath15 .",
    "namely , in case   we set    [ mod : c1 ] @xmath31\\left\\{1-\\exp\\left[-\\frac{w\\tau}{t(f)}\\right]\\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is used , where @xmath32 is the time scale characterizing the process of learning the pattern @xmath25 and given by the expression @xmath33 here the scale @xmath34 characterizes the time interval required for the working memory to create one slide and the dependence of the quantity @xmath32 on @xmath0 reflects the fact that the higher the current value @xmath10 , the less the time necessary to learn the pattern @xmath25 completely , the exponents @xmath35 and @xmath36 specify this dependence .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 characterizes the duration of initial creation of the pattern @xmath18 in the working memory .",
    "if we retrieve the chunk @xmath15 immediately after this action its achievable pattern is @xmath38 the strength @xmath39 of the slide @xmath23 created and saved just now is set equal to unity , @xmath40 which is related directly to the assumption about the reduction of the slide capacity at the moment of its creation .",
    "as time goes on , the strength of all the slides decreases and without addition learning the strength @xmath10 of the chunk @xmath15 as whole is written as the sum of all the slides created previously @xmath41 equalities  , , and may be treated as the bayesian approximation of the memorizing process .",
    "the given model assumes the slides created previously not to be affected by learning at the current moment of time . in other words , after creation their evolution is governed only by some internal mechanisms . keeping in mind the results to be obtained",
    "let us write the equation governing the evolution of a slides @xmath42 in the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are some parameters .",
    "equality   is actually the initial condition imposed on the function @xmath46 .",
    "its solution is @xmath47^{-d } \\qquad\\text{for $ t\\geq t'$}\\,,\\ ] ] where we have introduced the new parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the substitution of into yields @xmath50^{-d}\\,.\\ ] ] it should be noted that this governing equation of the individual trace dynamics is fair similar to the mathematical model for a single trace memory proposed by @xcite .",
    "expression   can be regarded as a solution @xmath51 of the equation @xmath52 subject to the initial condition @xmath53 where the values @xmath0 and @xmath54 are treated as constants , the variable @xmath55 describing the attention to the subject of current learning is assumed to be a smooth function on time scales about @xmath28 .",
    "it enables us to represent the value of @xmath30 , exp .",
    ", as the cumulative result of infinitesimal increments @xmath56 of a certain continuous process , where @xmath57 this expression would lead exactly to formula   if the time scale @xmath54 were independent of @xmath0 .",
    "however , ansatz   has been chosen rather arbitrary keeping in mind only the basic features it should possess .",
    "so we are free to replace it by the expression stemming from model  .",
    "the last equality in model   formally coincides with formula   except for the fact that the value @xmath10 has to decrease additionally due to time evolution of temporal elements created previously . however , all the `` microscopic '' time scales , in particular , @xmath58 and @xmath34 , are related directly to the interval within that a new slide is created in the working memory and , then , transfered to the declarative memory .",
    "it enables us to ignore this decrease in the value @xmath10 during the time interval @xmath28 . as a result expression",
    "can be reduced to the following integral @xmath59\\frac{w(t')}{t[f(t')]}\\left[1+\\frac{(t - t')}{\\tau_0}\\right]^{-d}dt'\\,.\\ ] ] moreover , due to the integral @xmath60 converging at the lower boundary @xmath61 for the exponent @xmath62 we can replace kernel   by the corresponding power - law kernel @xmath63^{-d}\\quad \\rightarrow\\quad \\frac{\\tau_0^d}{(t - t')^d } \\,.\\ ] ] after this replacement expression   reads    [ conmod:6 ] @xmath64\\frac{w(t')}{t[f(t')]}\\frac{\\tau_0^d}{(t - t')^d}dt'\\,.\\ ] ] or using ansatz   @xmath65^\\alpha [ 1-f(t')]^\\beta w(t')\\frac1{(t - t')^d}dt'\\,.\\ ] ]    in deriving expression   we have aggregated the ratio @xmath66 into the quantity @xmath55 .",
    "so , first , the integral equation   contains only one microscopic time scale @xmath34 regarded as a certain model parameter .",
    "second , the dimensionless quantity @xmath67 describes the attention to the subject during the learning process . if @xmath68 then the given pattern @xmath18 can be learned completely for a time interval about @xmath28 .    finalizing the given construction",
    "we will assume that the learning process was initiated at time @xmath69 and before it no information about the pattern @xmath18 was available , i.e. , for @xmath70 the value @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the integral equation   can be rewritten in the form of the following differential equation with time fractional derivative of the caputo type @xmath72 it is the desired governing equation for learning and forgetting processes .    in order to avoid some artifacts in numerical simulation we will accept an additional assumption that it is not possible to get strictly the limit value of the chunk strength @xmath73 by learning a subject . indeed , the closer the chunk strength to unity , the more attention is necessary for a human to recognized which piece of information is unknown for him . as a result , we introduce a certain critical value @xmath74 such that , when the chunk strength @xmath0 exceeds it , @xmath75 , a human considers the success of learning to be achieved and it attention to the learned subjects disappears , i.e. , @xmath76 for @xmath75 .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] .",
    "the characteristic features of the system dynamics were studied numerically using the explicit 2-flmm algorithm of second order @xcite for solving equation  .",
    "figure  [ fig.speff1 ] presents some of the obtained results .",
    "plot  i ( fig .",
    "[ fig.speff1 ] ) shows the forgetting dynamics under the `` basic '' conditions matching the following hypothetical situation . at the initial moment of time",
    "@xmath69 , a subject starts to learn continuously an unknown for him information pattern being retained in a single chunk and at time @xmath77 ends this process when the chunk strength gets its limit value @xmath78 . as time goes on ,",
    "the chunk strength @xmath10 decreases , which specifies the decay of retrievable information . as should be expected ,",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath10 is of the power law and looks like a straight line on the log - log scale plot .",
    "naturally , in a certain neighborhood @xmath79 of the time moment @xmath77 this asymptotics does not hold .",
    "however , for small values of the exponent @xmath3 ( for @xmath80 in plot  i ) this neighborhood is narrow and becomes actually invisible in approximating experimental data even with weak scattering .",
    "plot  ii exhibits the learning dynamics under the same `` basic '' conditions .",
    "the growth of the chunk strength @xmath10 is visualized again in the log - log scale for various values of the parameters determining how the learning rate @xmath81 changes during the process ( they are given in the inset ) .",
    "as seen , the function @xmath10 strictly is not of the power law .",
    "however , if it is reconstructed from some set of scattered experimental points as the best approximation within a certain class of functions , a power law fit ( linear ansatz in the log - log scale ) may be accepted as a relevant model .",
    "it allows us to introduce an effective exponent @xmath82 of the approximation @xmath83 .",
    "appealing again to plot  ii , we draw a conclusion that this effective exponent depends not only on the `` forgetting '' exponent @xmath3 but also on the other system parameters . thereby , in trying to determine the set of quantities required for characterizing human long - term memory , the `` forgetting '' and `` learning '' exponents , @xmath3 and @xmath82 , may be regarded as independent parameters .",
    "plots  iiia and iiib illustrate the found results in the case mimicking the discontinuous learning process .",
    "it again assumes a subject to start learning an initially unknown information pattern being retained in one chunk during the process , however , now he does not do this continuously .",
    "instead , the learning proceeds via a sequence of trials of a fixed duration that are separated by some time gap ( spacing ) until the subject gets the success at a certain time moment @xmath84 .",
    "naturally , the longer the spacing , the longer the total time @xmath84 as well as the larger the number @xmath85 of trials required for this .",
    "so , in order to compare their characteristic properties let us renormalize the time scale in such a way that the learning process end at @xmath86 in dimensionless units , in other words , the time is measured in units of @xmath84 . in this case , as seen in plot  iiia and iiib , the main characteristics of the shown processes become rather similar with respect to the dynamics of learning and forgetting .",
    "this result poses a question about optimizing a learning process by dividing it into rather short trials separated by relatively long time intervals .",
    "this effect is also called the distributed practice , an analysis of available experimental data can found , e.g. , in review by @xcite and @xcite as well .",
    "at least , within the framework of the present fair simple model an increase of the time spacing gives rise , on one hand , to the growth of the learning duration but , on the other hand , enables one to remember this information for a longer time without its considerable lost .      as far as the theoretical aspects of the present research are concerned",
    ", we note appealing to the obtained results that the multiple trace concept of memory architecture requires an individual mathematical formalism irreducible to the classical notions created in physics .",
    "in particular , even at the `` microscopic '' level dealing with slides ( traces ) the system dynamics is not reduced to the motion in a certain phase space but continuous generation of such phase spaces .",
    "their interactions with one another become a key point of the corresponding theory .",
    "besides , the governing equation   admits the following interpretation .",
    "its left - hand side describes `` internal '' evolution of human memory on its own , whereas the right - hand side plays the role of `` sources '' generating new elements of memory .",
    "this approach can enhance the development of human memory theory by separating the phenomena to be addressed into different categories .",
