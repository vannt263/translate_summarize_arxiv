    "the kondo effect is a paradigmatic many - body phenomenon where an impurity magnetic moment is screened by a sea of conduction electrons , leading to a collective singlet ( or reduced moment ) ground state.@xcite this effect and its impact on the low temperature resistivity of magnetically doped metals has been studied a great deal , with significant developments in recent years .",
    "@xcite advances in nanolithography have also enabled extensive studies of this effect in the carefully controlled environments provided by quantum dots.@xcite in these systems , the kondo effect manifests itself in high conductance values , where vanishing electrical current would be expected due to the classical coulomb blockade.@xcite the finite conductance is the result of electronic transport allowed through a fermi - level resonance that appears in the density of states of the dot at temperatures below a characteristic scale known as the kondo temperature .",
    "the supression of kondo correlations by the zeeman interaction that breaks the spin degeneracy of levels has been well established.@xcite the spin polarization of the impurity due to the external magnetic field results in a strong reduction of the kondo resonance near the fermi energy . in quantum dot devices ,",
    "this is signaled by a monotonic drop of the magnetoconductance for zeeman energies comparable to the kondo temperature .    in some quantum dot systems",
    ", however , the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field may result in non - monotonic magnetoconductance behavior .",
    "in particular , singlet - triplet transitions induced in quantum dots with even occupation give rise to complex structure in the linear magnetoconductance response , including maximum conductance at a finite magnetic field.@xcite another interesting possibility is the diamagnetic modification of the energy level - spacing in a singly - occupied quantum dot with multiply nearly degenerate orbitals and negligible zeeman splitting . in this case , the interplay between level shifts may also produce a maximum in the magnetoconductance at finite temperatures.@xcite    an interesting proposal by pustilnik @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite showed that the kondo effect can be induced by means of an in - plane magnetic field in quantum dots with even number of electrons .",
    "when the zeeman energy is close to the single - particle level - spacing , the near degeneracy of the singlet and triplet configurations results in an effective anisotropic exchange interaction dominating the scattering of the itinerant electrons .",
    "this creates a kondo resonance at magnetic fields higher than the kondo temperature of individual impurities , as experimentally observed in carbon nanotube dots with even occupation.@xcite    the scaling and perturbative analysis used in ref .  [ ] showed that the linear magnetoconductance of the system would be expected to indeed exhibit a maximum at a finite magnetic field .",
    "however , the results presented lack quantitative and detailed information on the different regimes of such system .",
    "for this reason , we believe that the rich behavior anticipated in the model deserves close examination with an approach such as wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , which has proven to provide an essentially exact description of the subtle kondo physics .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to carry out such systematic analysis of the problem focusing on the case of capacitively coupled quantum dots , which can be tuned to be in a regime described by this model .",

    "the state with single occupancy of each level is suppressed at zero field by an energy difference with the local singlet given by @xmath41 .",
    "as previously discussed , a high enough parallel magnetic field suppresses the spin fluctuations in the zeeman - split levels , which is known to destroy kondo correlation in the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) .",
    "@xcite however , in the two - level model , increasing the magnetic field up to a value given by @xmath42 gives rise to a spin - degenerate energy - level , built by opposite spin states of @xmath43 and @xmath44 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] , allowing spin - fluctuations in the system . under this scenario , the physics of the system",
    "is governed by kondo interactions _ restored _ by the zeeman field : the ground state is a many - body singlet , and the spectral functions develops a temperature - dependent resonance at the fermi level .",
    "further increasing the magnetic field beyond @xmath45 suppresses kondo correlations and the ground state becomes a frozen spin - integer object .",

    "kondo effect is alternatively described in fig . 1 ( c ) . as shown by this panel , at zero magnetic field",
    "the ground state is a local singlet ( both particles located at level 2 ) , while the triplets are the lowest excited states .",
    "when the magnetic field is increased , the triplet state @xmath37 decreases in energy , becoming degenerate with the local singlet state at @xmath35 ( or degenerate with @xmath38 at @xmath46 ) . since these states differ form each other by a spin flip and a charge transfer from one orbital to the other , the degeneracy allows the formation of the kondo effect discussed in this paper .    in the following section we present a schrieffer - wolff transformation of the hamiltonian to show that the scattering mechanism for itinerant electrons is dominated by exchange interactions in presence of a magnetic field .",

    "the simplest components are given by the @xmath69 terms , which are the usual kondo coupling between the levels and the conduction band .",

    "this kind of exchange interaction is restricted to @xmath73 and persists in a finite magnetic field .",

    "1 , ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) the exchange interaction at @xmath35 gives    @xmath78    and @xmath79 can be obtained by reversing the sign of the first term in the last equation .",
    "note also that @xmath80 , @xmath81 the process requires a spin - down particle to be located at @xmath44 [ see fig . 1 ( b ) ] .",
    "equation provides an analytic expression to estimate the exchange couplings of the mixed - level kondo effect in terms of the model parameters .",
    "note that for @xmath82 , and at the particle - hole symmetry point @xmath83 , the exchange couplings reduce to the simple expressions @xmath84 , close to the siam s expression of the exchange coupling .",
    "note that both @xmath85 and @xmath86 are independent of the levels splitting @xmath30 . from this",
    ", one may infer that the mixed - level kondo temperature will remain the same for different values of the detuning .",
    "however this is not the case , as we further show in this paper using nrg calculations .",
    "in order to provide a quantitative analysis of the behavior described above , we have used the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) approach.@xcite the nrg method has proven to be a powerful tool for studying quantum impurity systems in a non - perturbative scheme , as the technique allows the calculation of system properties with high accuracy . in particular , the calculation of the impurities contribution to the entropy @xmath87 as a function of temperature @xmath88 , permits the identification of effective degrees of freedom of the system . in the usual fashion it can be computed as , @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the mean energy ( relative to the ground state ) of the entire system , @xmath91 is the free energy and @xmath92 is the partition function .",

    "the following sections are devoted to prove that at @xmath35 , the ground state of the two - level anderson system is indeed a many - body ( kondo ) singlet state and to explore the behavior of the system for different @xmath21 fields and level spacing @xmath30 , by analyzing the thermodynamical and transport properties described above .",

    "however , one expects that as @xmath30 increases , the magnetically frozen spin-1/2 located at the lowest level interacts less with the mixed - level structure and the system resembles more the siam , as reflected in their respective kondo temperatures . consequently , the higher the value of @xmath30 , the lower the value of @xmath119 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in other words , in the mixed - level system , the level detuning can be seen as an extra parameter to control the kondo temperature of the structure .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] also shows ( right panel ) that for larger @xmath111 and fixed interlevel spacing @xmath30 , the critical value of @xmath45 decreases slightly .",
    "this behavior underscores that as the levels become effectively broader , the field required to achieve effective spin fluctuations decreases somewhat , as one would intuitively expect .",
    "we have extended the study of a different type of kondo effect , first studied in ref .  [ ] , which arises from the mixture of different levels with opposite spins , in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "examining the resulting model obtained by integrating out high energy states , we find different types of exchange possible in the system .",
    "moreover , our numerical renormalization results fully characterize the thermodynamics and transport properties of the system in the interesting regime of level degeneracy for opposite spin states due to the zeeman field .    the system under study can be seen to appear in capacitively coupled double quantum dot systems , although it may also be relevant in multilevel single - dot geometries . as a result of the level detuning ,",
    "the magnetoconductance exhibits a sharp non - monotonic behavior , in contrast to the single impurity anderson model .",
    "interestingly , the doubly - occupied double quantum dot system evolves from a local singlet ground state at zero field , to a many body singlet with kondo correlations as the zeeman field overcomes the level spacing in the structure .",
    "we have shown that this phenomenon can be used to experimentally estimate the level - spacing in quantum dots .",
    "in addition , the characteristc kondo temperature can be modified not only by the standard parameters of the anderson model , but also by the detuning of the quantum dot .",
    "finally , we should mention that the presence of sizable spin - orbit coupling in quantum dot systems may give rise to shifts in the characteristic @xmath45 fields with interesting dependence of the kondo conductance and temperature with applied field orientation in the plane of the dots.@xcite"
