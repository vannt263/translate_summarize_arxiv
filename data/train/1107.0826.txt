    "the leptonic cosmic ray spectrum gained new attention when the results of the balloon experiment atic were published @xcite .",
    "the authors claimed an anomalous excess in the spectrum just below 1tev .",
    "this started wild speculations about the nature of the source for these leptons , which should be in the relative vicinity of the solar system .",
    "those speculations were fueled further by new measurements from the pamela satellite published in @xcite claiming a rise in the positron spectrum above 10 gev .",
    "the lepton spectrum from the fermi satellite @xcite could not confirm the atic - peak quantitatively but showed a deviation from a straight power - law in the same energy region .",
    "the hess atmospheric cerenkov telescope extended the spectrum measurement beyond 1tev showing a cut - off or a steeper power - law but could also not confirm the atic excess @xcite .",
    "recently the fermi lepton spectrum was extended to lower energies ( 7gev ) in @xcite .",
    "also the pamela results were updated with new experimental data and different evaluation techniques in @xcite .    to interpret these measurements ,",
    "it is necessary to connect the injection spectra at the ( possible ) sources with the observations in the solar system . to do that we need a transport model that includes all the relevant processes in the ism ( spatial and momentum diffusion , cooling , particle escape , etc . ) .",
    "the derivation of the transport equation follows closely @xcite and @xcite . using quasi linear theory and the diffusion approximation the vlasov equation",
    "is transformed into the steady - state diffusion - convection equation for the phase space density @xmath3 , which can be written in the form @xmath4 with the spatial operator @xmath5\\ ] ] and the momentum operator @xmath6 this equation describes the diffusion ( coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 in space and momentum , respectively ) , acceleration and cooling ( rates @xmath9 ) and escape ( timescale @xmath10 ) of an injected source distribution @xmath11 .",
    "following @xcite the equation can be solved by separating the operators and the source term in their spatial and momentum dependencies .",
    "then the resulting steady state particle distribution can be written as an infinite sum : @xmath12 the spatial coefficients @xmath13 can be acquired by solving the diffusion equation in the appropriate geometry @xmath14 where @xmath15 take the role of inverse escape times for the momentum modes and @xmath16 is a convolution variable .    in this work",
    "we used the analytical solution for cylindrical geometries as provided by @xcite since this offers the best reflection of the symmetries of a spiral galaxy .",
    "analytical solutions in spherical and prolate spheroidal coordinates are also available @xcite and can be used to describe particle transport in elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "the momentum modes @xmath17 are solutions of the ode , commonly referred to as the leaky - box equation : @xmath18 - \\omega_i^2 \\kappa(p ) r_i = -q(p)\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the absolute scales for fermi i and ii processes and depend mainly on the alfven and shock speed , respectively . as @xcite have shown , an analytical solution for the equation can be found , if the cooling rate @xmath9 scales linearly with the particle energy , which is a good assumption for high energy protons and heavier nuclei .",
    "electrons above a few gev , however , are cooled primarily by synchrotron radiation and ic scattering , both scaling quadratically in particle energy .",
    "therefore the leaky - box equation was solved using numeric relaxation methods .",
    "to summarize , the model describes a particle distribution that is injected by a homogeneous population of time - independent sources in the galactic disc ( injection region ) , diffuses throughout the galactic disc and halo ( confinement region ) , cooling by bremsstrahlung , adiabatic deceleration , synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering , and leaves the confinement region at some point .",
    "the matter , photon and magnetic field distributions are assumed to be homogeneous over the whole confinement region .",
    "a model with a uniform source distribution is not a good choice to simulate high energy leptons from discrete sources ( snr , pwn  ) , since the short energy loss timescales make the source distribution critical for the resulting spectra , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "conversely , production of secondaries from p - p  collisions in the galactic halo can be approximated very well as a homogeneous source , since there are no dramatic variations in the cr and ism densities .    a similar analysis by @xcite used an analogue model as in this paper , but",
    "obviously did not include the new data above 1gev .",
    "@xcite has basically the same drawbacks , in addition this work has a more sophisticated secondary production model .",
    "compared with the recent works in this area like @xcite , we concentrate more on the low energy end of the current pamela data and the constraints it can put on propagation parameters if interpreted as secondaries .",
    "fortunately there is a lepton production process that can be approximated with a homogeneous spatial distribution : the secondary leptons from the decay of products of proton collisions . to get a galaxy - averaged flux of secondaries we consider collisions of high energy cosmic ray protons with ambient thermal matter , assuming that both populations are homogeneously distributed with average densities .    the pion production cross - section and the electron source function for a single p - p collision used here are parametrizations of results from the sibyll event generator from @xcite . folding the source function @xmath21 with the cosmic ray spectrum @xmath22 and the inelastic collision cross - section @xmath23 yields the electron flux : @xmath24 since the source function",
    "is sharply peaked , the cr spectrum can be cut off exponentially at the first knee ( @xmath25 tev ) with negligible deviations to the lepton spectrum below 10 tev : @xmath26 this parametrisation of the cr spectrum was obtained by fitting the cr data between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ev in @xcite .",
    "the average thermal matter density @xmath29 is treated as a free parameter .",
    "the resulting electron flux with a slightly harder power - law ( spectral index @xmath30 ) is used as the injection function in the transport model .",
    "since the parametrizations in @xcite only consider p - p  interactions , the actual flux of secondaries is underestimated by the contribution from heavier nuclei .",
    "fraction multiplied by a fit of the fermi @xmath31 data .",
    "combined systematic errors of pamela and fermi are shown by the grey area . the thick black line with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 yields the best fit of the positron spectrum , if combined with an extra high energy source as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] .",
    "the thin and dashed black lines show the slope change with changing escape losses.,width=313 ]    the principal shape of the resulting steady - state lepton spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter ] .",
    "the cooling , diffusion and escape processes introduce breaks in the injected power - law , so that multiple energy intervals with different spectral indices are formed , each of them defined by a different process . at the first break the injected power - law",
    "is steepened by @xmath35 as the diffusion / escape time scale becomes shorter than the time scale of bremsstrahlung and adiabatic cooling ( linear in energy ) .",
    "the second break appears when the time scale for synchrotron and ic losses becomes shorter that the diffusion time scale .",
    "these quadratic losses steepen the spectrum by 1 .",
    "the absolute flux value is determined mainly by the ism density , since the injected secondary spectrum has a linear @xmath29 dependence ( eq .",
    "( [ sec_flux ] ) ) , and to a lesser extent by escape and cooling losses , which transport particles out of the simulation region .",
    "so the model has three major parameters : the linear energy loss time scale that reflects the thermal gas density @xmath29 , the quadratic loss time scale that incorporates the energy densities of the em field ( composed of a constant cmb density of @xmath36ev/@xmath37 and a variable magnetic field @xmath38 ) and the escape time scale @xmath39 that corresponds to the size of the confinement region .",
    "measurements of the positron spectrum , in particular the newest results from pamela , allow us to constraint those parameters .",
    "a rather conservative statement can be made , if we assume that the secondaries have a negligible contribution to the positron spectrum .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter ] , assuming an average ism density of @xmath40m@xmath41 , the confinement region has to be less than the assumed @xmath42kpc or the diffusion process has to be more efficient , so that the particles leave the galaxy 10 times faster ( black dotted line ) . a higher ism density would require an even more efficient particle escape , so as not to overshoot the measured positron spectrum . since the spectral shape would nt play any role , the magnetic field can be almost arbitrary .",
    "on the other hand , the pamela data can be fitted very well with a superposition of two power - laws with a spectral index of about @xmath43 for the low energy part , corresponding remarkably well with the secondary spectrum steepened by synchrotron and ic losses . assuming the low energy positrons to be secondaries",
    "puts much stricter constraints on the parameters , since the second break in the spectrum has to appear at @xmath44 gev to match the data .",
    "the break energy is determined by the equilibrium of the diffusive / escape losses and the radiative losses .",
    "the thick black line in fig .  [ fig : parameter ] is the best fit with @xmath45m@xmath41 , @xmath46 and @xmath34 .",
    "the radiative losses in the galactic halo are dominated by ic scattering on the cmb photons , so that lowering the magnetic field has no effect on the break energy .",
    "a slight flattening at the low energy end of the spectrum is needed for the best fit of the new pamela data .",
    "this corresponds to a halo radius of @xmath42 kpc and a spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath47m@xmath48s@xmath49 , yielding an average confinement time @xmath50s .",
    "the absolute flux fixes the third parameter , the ism density , to @xmath51m@xmath41 . taking into consideration that about @xmath52 of the confinement region represent the galactic halo with an average gas density of about @xmath53m@xmath41 @xcite",
    ", the parameters seem very realistic .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : fit ] the latest fermi lepton measurement , in which the spectrum has been extended down to @xmath54gev , is shown .",
    "a generic fit of it was used to calculate a positron flux from the pamela positron fraction measurement .",
    "this data is used because it was taken simultaneously in the same solar cycle making interpretation easier .",
    "the hess high - energy data was shifted down by @xmath55 to better coincide with the fermi data .",
    "this is still within the systematic error margins of hess , not to mention the systematic error of fermi being of the same order of magnitude .",
    "once the secondary background has been subtracted from the pamela positron flux , the excess can be fitted very well with a simple power - law with a spectral index of @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , black dashed line ) .",
    "remarkably , if we assume the source of these `` extra '' positrons to be symmetric in @xmath57 , we can also fit the fermi bump leaving a primary lepton component of the shape @xmath58tev ) ( red dashed line ) .",
    "the ( shifted ) high - energy hess data provides a means to fix the cut - off energy of the `` extra '' leptons to about 920gev .    with the help of our semi - analytic transport model",
    "we were able to identify the low - energy pamela data as secondary positrons from collisions of cr protons with ism gas using very realistic values for the simulation parameters .",
    "an indirect implication from that is that lepton transport is dominated by radiative losses ( synchrotron and ic ) above 1gev .    assuming a generic primary lepton spectrum of the form @xmath59tev ) ,",
    "the pamela anomaly , the fermi bump and the high energy hess data can all be fitted by a single component , that is symmetric in @xmath57 with a power - law spectral index of @xmath56 and a cut - off energy of 920gev .",
    "this could either be a lepton population injected into the ism by nearby source with @xmath60 , so that the propagation time scale is shorter than the radiative loss time scale , or a more distant source with a much harder spectrum @xmath61 which is then steepened by radiative losses .",
    "a supernova remnant would be a good candidate in the first case , pulsars of different ages would suite both cases .",
