    "however , @xcite argued that such a model could not explain in detail the gas dynamics and physical conditions as revealed by sio masers and alternately proposed that the sio masers arise from material ablated from the surface of an accretion disk and discussed qualitatively the applicability of various classes of disk - wind models to source i. they find evidence to support that magnetic fields may play a role in driving and/or shaping the disk - wind from source i , based on details of gas dynamics on small scales , like curved and helical trajectories traced by maser motions . assuming a magnetic field is present , a magneto - centrifugally launched wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , poloidal and azimuthal velocities decrease substantially with increasing values of @xmath27 .",
    "since lower field strengths imply lower lorentz force , the flow is not efficiently accelerated resulting in lower velocities .",
