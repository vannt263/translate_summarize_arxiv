    "when survey respondents report numeric quantities , they often recall those numbers with error . respondents sometimes round up or down , for example , to the nearest integer , decimal place or multiple of 5 or 10 .",
    "this kind of misreporting is called heaping , and when the probability of heaping depends on the true value of the unheaped variable , the mechanism is nonignorable [ @xcite ] .",
    "heaping is a well - known problem in many survey settings , and robust inference for heaped data remains an important problem in statistical inference [ @xcite ] .",
    "reporting errors are frequently observed for a variety of measurements , including self - reported age [ @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] , height and weight [ @xcite ] , elapsed time [ @xcite ] and household purchases [ @xcite ] .",
    "respondents may be inclined to misreport when the survey addresses topics that seem private , embarrassing or culturally taboo [ @xcite ] .",
    "for example , there may be significant misreporting in studies of drug use [ @xcite ] , cigarette use [ @xcite ] or number of sex acts or sexual partners [ @xcite ] .",
    "several authors have proposed approximations to correct estimates using heaped data [ @xcite ] .",
    "others have explored smoothing techniques for heaped data on the grounds that smoothing may have the effect of `` spreading out '' grouped responses [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( @xcite ) provide an important unifying perspective on heaped and grouped data by introducing the concept of coarsening , in which one observes only a subset of the complete data sample space .",
    "based on this paradigm , @xcite formulate a model for heaped cigarette counts and apply these ideas to study impact of a drug treatment on smoking .",
    "@xcite discuss extensions of the coarse data concept to more general sample spaces than those considered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite model heaped nuchal translucency measurements as samples from a mixture model and propose a gibbs sampling scheme to draw from the joint distribution of the true counts and unknown rounding parameters .",
    "@xcite model the age at which subjects quit smoking by supposing that heaping takes place on a grid of multiples of 5 or 10 .",
    "most attempts to disentangle heaped count responses from latent true values can be understood as mixture models . to illustrate , suppose each subject draws their latent true count @xmath0 from a distribution with mass function @xmath1 on the nonnegative integers that depends on parameters @xmath2 and then reports a possibly different value @xmath3 from a reporting distribution with mass function @xmath4 that depends on the true count @xmath0 and parameters @xmath5 . because the reporting distribution @xmath6 depends on the latent true count @xmath0",

    "[ fig : schematic ]    many approaches characterize the reporting mechanism as a choice between reporting truthfully and misreporting at suspected heaping grid points [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the probability of reporting a particular heaped value depends on the value of the latent true value : @xcite use a proportional odds model for different heaping grids ; @xcite propose a multinomial distribution governing the choice of different heaping rules ; @xcite propose a semi - parametric model for heaping ( digit preference ) of duration - time data in which subjects are equally likely to round up or down .",
    "most models for count data only allow exact heaping to the multiple of 5 , 10 or 20 that is nearest to the latent true count , and the heaping rule is the same for all subjects .",
    "however , limiting heaped responses to the nearest grid point can produce inferences of true counts that are unrealistically constrained .",
    "for example , if the reported count is @xmath8 and the model only allows heaping to multiples of 5 , then one must infer @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , established models do not allow for misremembering as a function of the true count or quasi - heaping to counts close to , but not equal to , the specified grid values ( e.g. , a subject whose true count is 93 may report 101 or 99 instead of the heaped value 100 ) .    in this paper",

    "we imagine errors in self - reported counts to come from two sources : dispersion due to misremembering and heaping . misremembering adds variance by spreading reported counts around the true count . heaping results in preference for reporting certain counts , for example , on a grid of values such as multiples of 5 or 10 .",
    "we specify both of these sources of misreporting error using a bdp with jumping rates @xmath38 and @xmath39 that are modeled as functions of the finite - dimensional parameter vector @xmath5 .    to motivate development of our general bdp model for heaping , suppose for now that heaping occurs at multiples of @xmath43 .",

    "_ attraction _ to a given multiple means that the likelihood of the bdp moving toward that multiple is greater than the likelihood of moving in the other direction .",

    "subjects whose true number of sex partners is greater than 100 , for example , may be less able to accurately recall this number than subjects whose true count is less than 10 .",

    "the points are slightly jittered to show the density of samples .",
    "the gray dashed line traces @xmath180 .",
    "larger reported counts often correspond to smaller estimated true counts , possibly because the same subjects also reported very low counts at other timepoints .",
    "estimates of @xmath57 are similar for all bdp models with heaping , suggesting that dispersion or misremembering carries information that is distinct from heaping or rounding in the data .",
    "the regime parameters @xmath261 are similar for all the bdp heaping models , but likely not comparable to the wh08 model , as the heaping mechanism is different .",
    "estimates of the regime parameters can be interpreted by transforming them into their regime transition midpoints @xmath262 .",
    "for example , the posterior mean estimates for the `` heaping '' model indicate that the `` no heaping '' regime dominates when the true count is between 0 and @xmath263 ( posterior mean ) , and heaping to multiples of 50 dominates when the true count is greater than @xmath264 . between these values , heaping to multiples of 5 or 10 dominates .",
    "estimates of @xmath265 exhibit fairly large posterior variance , and posterior intervals for @xmath165 and @xmath162 show substantial overlap .",
    "this indicates that there is not strong evidence of heaping to multiples of 5 and 10 in the data ; rather , small counts exhibit little heaping , and large counts show strong heaping to multiples of  50 .",
    "we find that there is no significant difference in heaping by gender under our model : the gender - specific effect @xmath259 in the last model is not significantly different from zero .",
    "this finding is in contrast to those of other researchers who see a strong effect of gender on reporting of sexual behaviors [ @xcite ] .",
    "one of the goals of the clear study was to show that educational intervention for hiv - positive youth could reduce risky behaviors . while heaping behavior may differ with respect to gender among subjects in the clear study ,",
    "the small number of reported counts per subject does not permit us to detect such a difference under the bdp heaping model .",
    "the intervention tended to reduce true counts , and @xmath266 for every model .",
    "we report two goodness - of - fit measures .",
    "the first is deviance information criterion ( dic ) , computed by conditioning on posterior samples of the parameters that directly affect the outcome @xmath100 .",
    "for the `` no heaping '' model , these parameters are @xmath109 and @xmath267 ; for the wh08 model , the @xmath99 s and @xmath142 ; for the `` dispersion - only '' model , the @xmath99 s and @xmath57 ; for the `` heaping '' model , the @xmath99 s , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath142 ; for the `` subject - specific heaping '' model , the @xmath99 s , @xmath57 , @xmath142 and @xmath268 ; and for the `` subject - specific heaping@xmath269gender '' model , the @xmath99 s , @xmath57 , @xmath142 , @xmath256 and @xmath270 .",
    "the second goodness - of - fit measure is the sum of squared mean prediction errors , @xmath271 , where @xmath272 is the mean posterior predictive value of @xmath100 , calculated by conditioning on the same parameters as used to calculate the dic .",
    "the @xcite model is unique because @xmath273 depends only on the four rounding regimes parameters @xmath142 , so the dic is low , and the heaping models all show similar dic .",
    "the sspe tells a different story : the dispersion - only model shows the worst fit , and the bdp heaping models outperform the wh08 model .",
    "these goodness - of - fit measures should be interpreted carefully since the wh08 and bdp heaping models have a somewhat different structure .         for individual subjects under the bdp heaping model with subject - specific heaping parameters and the model of @xcite .",
    "the subject- and timepoint - specific covariate values are listed with each plot .",
    "a gray vertical line denotes the reported count @xmath274 .",
    "not all inferred true count distributions are centered at the reported count .",
    "moreover , the inferred true counts become more dispersed as the reported count increases .",
    "the @xcite model does not allow responses beyond the nearest heaping point and effectively puts a uniform prior distribution on responses that fall within this window .",
    "this results in inferred true counts whose posterior distribution is a truncated version of the predictive distribution of @xmath99 . ]    the proportional odds model for different heaping regimes ( rounding to 5 , 10 and 50 ) introduced by wh08 proves to be an essential ingredient in our analysis .",
    "the apparent heaping pattern observed in the clear counts of sex partners suggests that heaping to multiples of 50 happens often as counts become larger than 30 or 40 .",
    "we find that heaping models that required rounding to multiples of  5 , even for large counts , provide a very poor fit ( results not shown ) .",
    "however , in our analyses , the model of wh08 has a serious drawback : when only one heaping regime is in effect , it places a nearly uniform distribution on the true count .",
    "the inferred true count distribution is proportional to the product of this uniform distribution and the posterior predictive distribution of the true count .",
    "figure  [ fig : postexample ] illustrates the problem for specific subjects . both the wh08 model and the subject - specific bdp heaping model have similar predictive distributions @xmath275 for the latent true count @xmath0 , and in both cases only the @xmath276 regime ( rounding to the nearest multiple of 50 ) is in effect .",
    "but the rounding model of wh08 assumes that rounding is always to the _ nearest _ grid point , so , for example , a reported value of @xmath277 means that @xmath278 with probability one .",
    "the heaping distribution @xmath279 implicitly places a nearly uniform distribution on this set , so the inferred posterior distribution of the true count @xmath0 is a truncated version of @xmath275 .",
    "in contrast , the bdp heaping model provides a reporting distribution @xmath280 that has support on all of @xmath10 and preferentially places more mass on those @xmath0 that are most likely to deliver the reported count @xmath3 . in settings where the true counts themselves might be the objects of inference",
    ", we believe the bdp heaping model provides more realistic and useful estimates .",
    "in this paper we have illustrated how researchers can infer the posterior distribution of true integer counts from reported counts using a general bdp reporting distribution within a hierarchical modeling framework .",
    "our most substantial innovation is the novel reporting distribution @xmath4 based on the bdp with specially defined jumping rates that make the markov chain attracted to heaping grid points .",
    "use of simple linear bdps to model over - dispersion or reporting error has been proposed before [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , we have substantially expanded the possibilities for general birth  death models of reporting error to explicitly incorporate both over - dispersion and heaping , while providing a computational method to evaluate likelihoods and sample from the posterior distribution of the true counts .",
    "this approach has the benefit of providing a sophisticated and highly configurable family of reporting distributions indexed by the true count and just a few unknown parameters @xmath5 and @xmath142 .",
    "statisticians may understandably be wary of parametric assumptionsabout the way study participants report data . however , applied and methodological research in public health offers some clues into reporting mechanisms .",
    "researchers in this field often address the problem of reporting error in surveys related to sexuality and other taboo topics [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite discuss validation of reported counts of cigarettes smoked by measuring tobacco products in the blood . in related work ,",
    "@xcite compare instantaneous and retrospective self - reports of cigarette consumption under a similar model for heaping .",
    "other survey methods are possible , including using diary - like surveys or repeated questionnaires to assess reporting error .",
    "studies like these can provide useful information about the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath142 in our bdp heaping model .",
    "armed with prior information about rounding propensities , perhaps stratified by personal attributes such as gender , age or sexual orientation , public health researchers could proceed with a bayesian analysis similar to the one outlined in this paper to jointly estimate true counts and regression parameters . designing a model that accommodates various assumptions about both the mechanism generating the true counts and the cognitive processes that give rise to the reported counts can be challenging .",
    "the bdp model for heaped counts presented in this paper is one promising step in this direction .",
    "we efficiently find the transition probabilities @xmath281 by first applying the laplace transform to both sides of the forward equations [ @xcite ] .",
