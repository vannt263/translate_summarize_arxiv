    "recently many authors have intensively studied the magnetosphere of the rotation powered pulsars by means of computer simulations in force - free approximation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , two component mhd ( @xcite ) and particle simulation ( @xcite ) . in such studies , boundary layers ,",
    "e.g. the equatorial current sheet and the surface of the star , are sometimes troublesome .",
    "dissipation is suggested in the boundary layers ( @xcite ) , but it can be numerical . acceleration and heating likely take place in the magnetic neutral sheet around the equatorial plane .",
    "the inner edge of the neutral sheet , which is called the `` y - point '' , is the open - close boundary of the magnetic field structure ( figure [ magnetosphere ] ) .",
    "location of the y - point is not certain and can be inside of the light cylinder ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study the y - point in microscopic point of view to understand the dissipative process in the boundary layer .",
    "we expect that our simulation provides a hint for the appropriate boundary conditions for the global simulation . as has been suggested by @xcite ,",
    "another possibility is that the y - point might be a gamma - ray source .",
    "pulsed gamma - ray radiation is previously attributed to the outer gaps and/or the polar caps .",
    "one may say that the radiation near and beyond the light cylinder becomes dc components , but this may not be the case .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the magnetic neutral sheet in the wind far from the light cylinder can be the source of the gamma - ray pulses .",
    "if dissipation of the magnetic field around the y - point takes place , radiation from the vicinity of the y - point would also contribute to the pulsed high energy emission .",
    "@xcite calculated the force - free solution around the y - point .",
    "however , he found that the force - free condition is broken around the neutral sheet .",
    "the global mhd simulation @xcite also suggested breakdown of force - free condition around the neutral sheet and the magnetic energy conversion to the thermal and kinetic energy .",
    "the plasma inertia and magnetic dissipation seem to play an important role around the y - point .",
    "we intend to study the y - point via newly developed axisymmetric particle - in - cell ( pic ) method in the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "this paper is aimed to establish the numerical code , the results of code check , and the initialization for the y - point simulation .",
    "some of the initial result shall be given though detailed analysis shall be given in a subsequent paper .",
    "in our scheme , the system is reflection symmetry with respect to the equator , which is the lower boundary .",
    "the free boundary condition is imposed on the outer boundary , which should be continued to the wind zone .",
    "the left and upper boundaries ( inner boundaries ) are assumed to satisfy the force - free solution given by @xcite .",

    "both particle code and vlasov code describe the plasma kinetic effect .",
    "however , vlasov simulation requires huge computer memory , so that we use the particle code in our simulation .",
    "the simplest system to treat the y - point would be the axisymmetric one , and therefore we developed axisymmetric pic code using cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we use buneman - boris method in cartesian coordinates .",
    "then , particles are distributed in the three - dimensional cartesian coordinates ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath1 ) and solved by buneman - boris method .",

    "current density is also calculated with the shape factors : @xmath53    we interpolate the current densities at the full integer grids to those at the appropriate grid points shown in figure [ teigi ] by @xmath54    since the above current density does not guarantee the charge conservation law , the electric fields contain an error .",
