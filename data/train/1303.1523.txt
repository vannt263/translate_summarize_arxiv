    "the quantum fluctuations during inflation are stretched to super - hubble scales and return to the hubble horizon after inflation .",
    "they provide the seeds of cmb anisotropy and the large scale structure @xcite .    here",
    "we review the cosmic perturbation theory , which calculates inflationary fluctuations .",
    "there have been already many books , reviews and lecture notes in this area @xcite . in the present review we focus on an explicit treatment of the standard theory , including linear and non - linear perturbations . after that",
    ", we make a broad survey of models . before those aspects",
    ", we briefly overview the inflationary cosmology in the rest of this section .",
    "the dynamics of the standard hot big bang cosmology is governed by the friedmann equation . by assuming the universe is homogeneous , isotropic and flat .",
    "thus for algebraic simplicity we also assume flatness unless stated otherwise . ]",
    ", the metric can be written as the frw form : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "note that in a flat universe , the scale factor itself does not have physical meaning . because we can always rescale @xmath1 and spatial coordinate @xmath2 together . on the other hand ,",
    "ratios of scale factors are important .",
    "for example the hubble parameter @xmath3 and the redshift @xmath4 are key quantities in cosmology .    with the frw metric",
    ", the 00-component of the einstein equation is the friedmann equation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy density . for non - interacting energy components ,",
    "the time evolution ( characterizing how this component dilutes with expansion of the universe ) at the homogeneous and isotropic level is determined by the continuity equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is pressure , which can be determined by @xmath9 ( and perhaps other parameters ) from the equation of state for this form of matter .",
    "for example , for thermal matter , @xmath10 can be calculated from the thermal partition function .",
    "for the cosmological constant , @xmath11 follows from lorentz invariance .",
    "our present universe is matter ( @xmath12 ) dominated . at earlier times , the universe was hotter and radiation ( @xmath13 ) dominated .",
    "however , radiation domination can not be eternal to the past .",
    "this is because from eq .",
    "( [ eq : friedmann ] ) , inserting @xmath14 , we get @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an integration constant .",
    "the moment @xmath18 is a physical singularity , where scale factor sinks to zero and physical energy density diverges .",
    "note that @xmath19 is the proper time measured by a comoving observer .",
    "thus the radiation dominated universe must start at some finite physical time ( 137gyr ago ) .",
    "the start of the radiation dominated universe is known as the `` hot big bang '' .",
    "the singularity at @xmath18 requires the hot big bang . but this singularity by itself does not imply what happens before the hot big bang , or even if anything , including spacetime , exists or not before that . nevertheless , the hot big bang cosmology is sensitive to its initial conditions .",
    "there are strong evidences ( almost firm proof ) showing that new physics exists before the big bang .",
    "and inflation is so far the most successful candidate for this very early epoch . in the remainder of the section",
    ", we shall focus on those evidences and how inflation explains them .",
    "it is a surprising fact that we find ourselves living in a huge universe  about @xmath20 kilometers in the observable radius and @xmath21 years in age ( where kilometers and years are human s natural units ) .",
    "this turns into a greater surprise when we realize that our universe is supported by fundamental physics , where the natural scales are ev , gev or even planck scale . in those units the age and size of our universe",
    "are about @xmath22ev@xmath23 ( @xmath24gev@xmath25 ) .",
    "those surprises can be formulated in more accurate terms , by the horizon and flatness problems of the standard hot big bang cosmology . to see those problems ,",
    "let us assume for a time that nothing happened before the hot big bang .",
    "in other words assume the universe is radiation dominated all the way back in the early times .",
    "then problems arise :    * _ horizon problem ( i ) : _ let us start with an example of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "+ from observations , we actually see the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in the past , because light ( or any other causal signal ) needs time to propagate to us . by optical probes",
    ", we can observe the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe up to as early as recombination : when the cmb forms , the universe is already very homogeneous and isotropic ( up to fluctuations of order @xmath26 , which we will discuss soon ) .",
    "+ however , from the hot big bang to the time of recombination , causal signals could only propagate a limited distance in space .",
    "this is because those signals could at most propagate at speed of light , with null geodesic @xmath27 .",
    "thus the physical distance of propagation ( measured by today s ruler @xmath28 ) from the big bang to recombination is at most .",
    "nevertheless this does nt make a big difference for this estimate . ]",
    "@xmath29 to put in numbers , the causal signals , from the hot big bang to recombination , could only propagate as long as about 1/100 of the radius of our observable universe .",
    "thus different patches of the cmb sky were casually disconnected .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] .",
    "+ one could also consider this problem using conformal time .",
    "this is because conformal time , together with comoving spatial coordinates , straightforwardly shows the causal structure of spacetime .",
    "the flat frw metric can be rewritten as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is defined ( up to a constant ) by @xmath32 . using conformal time , the light cones are 45 degree straight lines in the @xmath31-@xmath33 plane . thus the distance luminal signals travel equals to conformal time .",
    "+ consider equation of state @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "one finds @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath37 for a fluid with @xmath38 ( including matter and radiation ) , a very short period of proper time @xmath39 corresponds to a very short period of conformal time @xmath40 .",
    "thus light can not propagate far during this period of time .",
    "+ the horizon problem of hot big bang cosmology . the space and time in this diagram should be understood as comoving and conformal respectively .",
    "the several smaller light cones are truncated between the hot big bang and recombination ( the time of cmb formation ) .",
    "those light cones have no overlap at the time of hot big bang , thus they are causally unrelated at recombination . but why , they at recombination ( for example a and b in the figure ) , look similar to each other ( considering we can observe many of them , as indicated by the greater light cone between recombination and the present time)?,scaledwidth=60.0% ] + note that in the cmb example of the horizon problem , @xmath41 is set by the scale of observation instead of the intrinsic nature of the problem itself . more generally , we could consider different observables ( replace @xmath41 with other time scales ) and generate a family of similar horizon problems .",
    "for example , problems of causally disconnect patches of large scale structure .",
    "* _ horizon problem ( ii ) : _ one could alternatively formulate the puzzle of horizon size in another way .",
    "imagine we are observers sitting at @xmath42 , who have existed since the hot big bang , and there exists some structural information @xmath43 which are comoving in the universe ( including homogeneity , isotropy and flatness , and departures from those ideal conditions ) .",
    "we could observe @xmath43 by luminal or sub - luminal signals emitted from the structures on @xmath43 . now at time @xmath44 ( not before or after ) , how much portion of @xmath43 could we observe ( in comoving size ) ?",
    "+ we find there is a competition in this situation . on the one hand ,",
    "as @xmath44 becomes larger , the past light cone is larger thus we tend to see more structures on @xmath43 . on the other hand , the expansion of the universe itself tends to hide those structures into more distant regions , where we may not be able to observe .",
    "interestingly , those two effects depends on different order of derivatives of @xmath1 .",
    "thus typically there is a winner between them .",
    "the comoving size of the observable universe is characterized by the comoving horizon size : + @xmath45 + we find that as we move forward in time , we see more and more portion of @xmath43 . in other words , comoving objects are floating inwards from outside of our horizon .",
    "this is not to be confused with the concepts of the particle horizon or the event horizon . ] . or from the horizon point of view",
    ", the universe is not expanding `` fast '' enough , and thus the horizon keeps expanding in comoving size .",
    "( here we have quoted `` fast '' , because the time dependence of the quantity @xmath46 is actually the acceleration of expansion , instead of the expansion speed . )",
    "+ now comes the horizon problem : if no one could never `` see '' ( more accurately , interact with ) those structures in the early universe , how could they be causally prepared , and prepared in a consistent way ?",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flatness ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon - return ] .",
    "+ the horizon problem ii , or the flatness problem . at early times",
    ", the observer could only observe a small portion of the universe thus unaware of larger scale structures ( e.g. the spherical topology in the figure ) . at later times though",
    "radiation or matter domination , the universe expands .",
    "however , the observer s horizon expands faster .",
    "thus the observer could obtain more large scale structural information ( e.g. easier to measure the non - flatness of the universe , if exists ) . from current observation ,",
    "the universe is rather flat now .",
    "if there were non - flatness in our universe , how could causal process produce them in the early universe , considering no causal process could see this non - flatness in the early universe?,scaledwidth=60.0% ] +   the comoving scales return to the horizon in radiation and matter dominated eras.,scaledwidth=95.0% ] * _ flatness problem : _ the flatness problem could be considered as an example of the version ( ii ) of the horizon problem . here",
    "the structural information @xmath43 is the spatial curvature of the universe . for simplicity ,",
    "we havent put spatial curvature into the metric .",
    "nevertheless , we could imagine we live on a sphere instead of a flat plane .",
    "+ when the universe expands , the curvature radius @xmath47 should expand together , keeping @xmath48 ( with proper normalization of @xmath1 ) . nevertheless ,",
    "as horizon problem ( ii ) , in matter or radiation dominated universes , the universe does not expand `` fast '' enough thus we still see more and more portion of the sphere as time goes on .",
    "+ so far , we havent seen any curvature ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "thus at a much earlier time , @xmath47 has to be greater than @xmath50 by a much greater amount .",
    "how could such a flat universe be prepared at the beginning , without the help of causal processes ?",
    "this is not yet the end of the story .",
    "some uv - completion theories of the particle physics standard model predict topological defects . from those theories ,",
    "another question arises :    * _ monopole problem _ :",
    "phase transitions of the early universe may produce gauge theory monopoles . if produced , they are supposed to dominate the energy density the universe .",
    "but we havent found them .",
    "( on the other hand , global monopoles is not necessarily a problem . )",
    "so far we have outlined a few problems for the standard picture of the hot big bang cosmology . however , it is worth noticing that sometimes it is hard to judge the seriousness of conceptional problems :    on the one hand , it is because those conceptional problems are paradigm dependent .",
    "for example , the monopole problem could be simply solved by starting with a theory without monopole solutions .",
    "one could as well argue that the universe could start from some almost deterministic initial conditions where the universe is extremely flat and uniform .",
    "those theories exist , such as the quantum creation of universe @xcite ( see also @xcite for a different approach with different predictions ) .",
    "on the other hand , solution to some problems may not be complete , or may also raise other ( though arguably less serious ) problems .",
    "we will come back later to the new problems brought by inflation .",
    "however , there does exist physical problem of the hot big bang , without proper extension before the bang .",
    "this is the problem of large scale correlations on the cmb ( or in the large scale structure ) .    *",
    "_ correlation problem : _ again consider fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] .",
    "actually the cmb map is not absolutely homogeneous and isotropic , but instead has small fluctuations on it , with an amplitude @xmath51 . now consider the statistical correlation of those fluctuations , in regions a and b. assuming nothing exists before the hot big bang , a and b should nt have correlations .",
    "however , those statistical correlations were caught , mode by mode in momentum space , in the cmb experiments @xcite . with nowadays cmb map ( wmap:@xcite act:@xcite spt:@xcite ) , one can actually observe by eyes that the fluctuations are very different from a map generated from white noise .    indeed , historically it is the verified predictions of inflation from the correlation in the cosmic perturbations , instead of the conceptual `` postdictions '' , that convinced the majority that inflation should be the theory of the very early universe and produce the dominant seed of cmb and structure formation .      inflation is a period of time before the hot big bang , during which the universe undergoes accelerating expansion : @xmath52    for example , consider a constant equation of state @xmath34 . in this case acceleration",
    "implies @xmath53 .",
    "and as we shall see , inflation typically require @xmath54 ( approach -1 from the greater side ) .    before going into detailed dynamics which could drive the above accelerating expansion ,",
    "let us first have a look how inflation solves the problems in the previous subsection .    * _ horizon problem ( i ) : _ from equation ( [ eq : sol - conformal - time ] )",
    ", we find that in case of acceleration ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath55 .",
    "thus small proper time interval @xmath56 means negative and large conformal interval @xmath57 .",
    "+ remember that @xmath40 corresponds to the distance that light ray could travel .",
    "@xmath57 means that light ray could travel a very long distance during the @xmath53 epoch ( although could be a small interval of proper time @xmath58 ) before reaching the time of recombination . thus fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] is replaced by fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon - inflation ] , where the initial @xmath17 hypersurface is stretched downwards in conformal distance , and light cones with tips on cmb becomes highly overlapped at @xmath17 .",
    "+ alternatively , we can re - calculate the light propagation distance , similarly to eq .  : during inflation @xmath59 this corresponds to an exponentially large distance , that light signals could have travelled during inflation .",
    "* _ horizon problem ( ii ) and the flatness problem : _ those problems arises because @xmath60 was a decreasing function all the way since the creation of the universe ( i.e. @xmath61 ) .",
    "now we have a period of inflation @xmath62 before the hot big bang .",
    "thus the horizon problem ( ii ) and the flatness problem are solved provided that the @xmath62 period is long enough .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon - inflation ] , where the left and right panels plots the same physics , in spacetime diagram and in terms of change of comoving horizon scale , respectively .",
    "+ inflation solves the horizon problem .",
    "thanks to the accelerated expansion , the conformal time @xmath31 is no longer tightly bounded by the big bang singularity @xmath63 .",
    "thus the past light cones on the cmb overlap in the past , which solves the horizon problem.,scaledwidth=60.0% ] +   the comoving scales exits the horizon during inflation , and later returns during radiation and matter dominated eras.,scaledwidth=95.0% ] * _ monopole problem : _ if monopoles were created before inflation , they could easily be inflated away .",
    "thus it is no wonder we can not observe them today .",
    "( however , one should still pay attention not to produce gauge theory monopoles , domain walls or very strong cosmic strings after inflation . ) * _ correlation problem : _ how inflation solves this problem",
    "is discussed in detail in later sections .",
    "the key idea is that , the sub - hubble quantum fluctuations are stretched by cosmic expansions during inflation , into super - hubble fluctuations .",
    "those fluctuations return to the horizon later after the end of inflation .",
    "those returned modes cause large scale correlations on the cmb .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon - inflation ] .",
    "inflation is clearly a very powerful tool for solving problems with standard cosmology , so let us now proceed to see how inflation can be explicitly realized .",
    "the requirement @xmath64 is not that easy to obtain . because our familiar components in the universe have positive pressure .",
    "for example , consider a gas of particles in a box .",
    "the particles always `` want '' to escape the box , and hence generate positive pressure by hitting the surface of the box .",
    "the same difficulty can be also observed from the continuity equation @xmath65 . again",
    "consider a gas component ( but now in the whole universe ) .",
    "both particle density and momentum of particles get diluted when the universe expands .",
    "thus @xmath9 should dilute at least as quickly as @xmath66 .",
    "especially , when @xmath54 , we want a component whose energy density is almost not diluted when the universe expands .    to have such an acceleration , one immediate idea is to use vacuum energy .",
    "this is because , the vacuum , after adiabatic expansion , is still vacuum .",
    "we shall come back to this issue later in details . ] .",
    "thus we have @xmath67 and the universe accelerates .",
    "however , if we use the vacuum energy to accelerate our early universe , problems arise :    * _ inflation must end .",
    "_ our universe is not always in a state of acceleration .",
    "observationally , significant parts of our directly observable history was radiation and matter dominated and the universe decelerates instead of accelerates in expansion .",
    "theoretically , we need the comoving structures to return to the horizon . * _ the end of inflation must be controlled by a rather accurate clock_. the overlapping of light cones in fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon - inflation ] does not guarantee ( though makes it possible ) that we observe an almost homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "for example , if one significant part of the universe has much earlier end of inflation , then energy density drops quickly in that part and it will produce a void in our universe , breaking homogeneity and isotropy .    the vacuum energy itself does not provide an exit mechanism for inflation . moreover ,",
    "even if we add anything , like tunneling to another vacuum , as the end of inflation , it will not solve the problem as long as there is no clock .",
    "for example , the tunneling to another vacuum happened spontaneously instead of being controlled by a clock .",
    "be the decay rate of the false vacuum .",
    "then when @xmath68 , inflation will end within one e - fold , thus do not really solve problems .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath69 , true vacuum bubbles can not percolate because the space between true vacuum bubbles expand too quickly . in this case",
    "we found ourselves in an open bubble @xcite , and the flatness problem returns .",
    "thus inflation will either end too quickly or will never end globally . ]",
    "thus , we have to attach a clock to vacuum energy , and use this clock to end inflation .",
    "a clock is something that takes a number at every physical point in the spacetime manifold , with the numbers increasing along an observer s world line .",
    "thus a clock can be simply realized by a rolling scalar field .",
    "in other words we would need an effective vacuum energy , controlled by the motion of a scalar field .    the change from a vacuum energy to a rolling scalar field",
    "can be thought of as follows : a vacuum energy plus a massless scalar can be viewed in an alternative way as a scalar field lying on a flat potential . by slightly tilting the potential , we have a slowly rolling scalar field acting as an effective vacuum energy",
    ". this picture can be visualized by the analog of a rolling ball along a very flat surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inflation - potential ] .",
    "the rolling scalar is called the `` inflaton '' .",
    "further , inflation could be ended by adding some additional mechanisms triggered by some particular value of inflaton .",
    "for example , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : inflation - potential ] , after @xmath70 , the potential @xmath71 is no longer flat thus inflation ends when @xmath72 rolls to @xmath70 . in this case",

    "for example , one can make an ansatz @xmath89const , and this case is called `` power law inflation '' @xcite , resulting in an exponential potential of @xmath72 .",
    "however , here we expect more general solutions .",
    "thanks to the friction force , there is a slow - roll - approximated solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom - phi - bg ] ) when the potential is flat enough , regardless the details of the potential .",
    "this is the solution that the fraction force balances the external force @xmath90 , such that the acceleration of @xmath72 does not change significantly .",
    "in addition , to have inflation , we want the potential energy @xmath71 dominates over the kinetic energy @xmath91 .",

    ", we have @xmath98 the subscript @xmath88 means that those small `` slow roll parameters '' are defined using the inflation potential .",
    "this is convenient because by model construction , we typically start with a potential and want to know immediately if the potential is flat enough to have inflation . in those _",
    "small _ parameters .",
    "it turns out quite hard to get those slow roll conditions satisfied . ]",
    "especially , when inflation is driven by the mass of the inflaton , we have @xmath99 thus @xmath100 actually denotes the mass square of the inflaton , measured in hubble units .",
    "the condition @xmath101 means , the dynamics of the _ inflationary background _ , has an energy scale much smaller than hubble parameter .",
    "as we shall see later , the inflationary perturbations actually lives on the energy scale @xmath80 , with initial condition set on an even higher energy scale .",
    "it is also convenient to define another set of slow roll parameters using the dynamics of scale factor : @xmath102 when slow roll conditions @xmath103 and @xmath104 are satisfied , those slow roll parameters are related to @xmath105 and @xmath100 by @xmath106 when slow roll conditions are not satisfied , the relations between ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) and ( @xmath105 , @xmath100 ) are non - linear .      as we have shown , in the slow roll approximation , given a flat enough potential , there exists a slowly rolling inflationary solution .",
    "to take this solution seriously , it is important to consider the naturalness : could this solution be reached easily without highly fine - tuned initial conditions ?",
    "this is in general a hard problem . because on the one hand , the dynamics before inflation is yet unknown .",
    "thus the a priori naturalness is not well defined . on the other hand , even consider the mathematical naturalness , one need to consider a measure of the phase space .",
    "unfortunately , the phase space measure for inflation divergences and different regularization method leads to different conclusions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the solution of slow roll inflation is an attractor , in the sense that a general point in the phase space of inflation typically flows onto a slow roll trajectory .",
    "an attractor solution is natural , at least in a naive way .",
    "there is an intuitive way to see this attractor behavior : the potential energy of inflation acts as an effective vacuum energy , and thus do not significantly redshift during inflation .",
    "however , the kinetic energy of inflaton tends to be redshifted away quickly .",
    "as discussed in the last section , without continuous injection of energy from the potential , the kinetic energy of @xmath72 decays as @xmath109 .",
    "thus , on the one hand , if the universe starts potential dominated , we are fine to have inflation already . on the other hand ,",
    "if the universe starts kinetic energy dominated , with a small coherent potential energy , the kinetic energy will get diluted away and the universe will eventually become potential dominated .",
    "thus inflation is a dynamical attractor solution .",
    "as we already emphasized , it is important to end inflation . from local energy conservation ,",
    "the effective vacuum energy should go somewhere .",
    "the simplest case is that this effective vacuum energy decays into matter or radiation , which heats the universe .",
    "this process is called reheating .    after reheating ,",
    "the universe is radiation dominated , thus @xmath110 where @xmath80 is the energy scale at reheating .",
    "we require the reheating temperature to be compatible with bbn .",
    "thus @xmath111mev .",
    "this is considered as a hard lower bound for inflationary energy scale @xmath112gev .",
    "nevertheless , we expect inflation to happen at much higher energy scales , because it is increasingly harder to build a flat potential at extremely low energy scale .",
    "if reheating is sufficient , most of the vacuum energy goes into radiation . in this case",
    "@xmath80 is close to the energy scale of inflation .    unlike the dynamics during inflation , the dynamics of reheating",
    "is extremely model dependent . here",
    "we shall not come into detailed physics ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "instead we only outline the generic class of models :    * _ perturbative decay : _ in this case , the decay is characterized by a decay rate @xmath113 in particle physics @xcite .",
    "a typical scenario of this kind has the inflaton oscillate around its minima of potential after inflation . and",
    "when the duration of oscillation is longer than @xmath114 , the inflaton energy decays into other particles .",

    "this vacuum state is known as the bunch - davies vacuum @xcite . the same vacuum state can also be obtained in various other ways .",
    "for example , the bunch - davies vacuum can be obtained by the no boundary wave function of the universe .",
    "this is because the euclidean version of initial time , @xmath170 , is a regular point on the sphere , thus should nt result in a divergence in the euclidean action .",
    "alternatively , it is also believed that the bunch - davies vacuum is an attractor solution of inflation .",
    "quite general ( but not all ) initial states are eventually driven to the bunch - davies state due to the cosmic expansion .    before ending the discussion of vacuum , some more comments are in order here :    * _ the relation between eq .",
    "( [ eq : annihilate - vacuum ] ) and minimalizing the hamiltonian : _ at first glance , they look like the same condition .",
    "this is because , in flat space qft , @xmath171 annihilate one particle .",
    "so eq .  ( [ eq : annihilate - vacuum ] ) means there is no particle , and thus is lowest energy state . to relate @xmath171 to the concept of `` annihilate one particle ''",
    "] however , on time dependent background , things become more complicated . + on a time dependent background , matter energy is not globally conserved .",
    "a `` empty '' state without particle could evolve into a state with lots of particles in it . note that we work in the heisenberg picture .",
    "once we have defined the `` vacuum '' state , the state does not evolve with time .",
    "however once we define the vacuum state as the lowest energy state at one time , the same state could be no longer the lowest energy state at another time , due to the time dependence of the matter hamiltonian .",
    "here , we minimalize the energy at @xmath158 , as one essential piece of vacuum selection . * _ the vacuum is selected in the uv : _ note that @xmath158 corresponds to the @xmath157-mode has almost zero wave - length and infinite energy .",
    "thus in this procedure , the vacuum is selected in the uv .",
    "the @xmath172 limit can not be reached in qft because qft is considered as an effective field theory with a uv completion .",
    "the uv completion scale is at most planck scale .",
    "as we have discussed , this is the `` trans - planckian '' problem of inflation .",
    "one might expect the selection of initial state at @xmath172 could be relaxed to a selection of lowest energy state at @xmath173 , as long as @xmath174 . before @xmath175 , the universe can be considered as expanding adiabatically and no particle is produced . * _ the vacuum is selected linearly mode by mode : _ we first linearized the theory , and consider one @xmath157-mode without worrying about other modes .",
    "in other words , we implicitly set all other @xmath157-modes to zero .",
    "in flat space qft , we can safely do that because in scattering process we indeed have set other modes to zero , at least locally near the incoming wave packet .",
    "however , in a time dependent background , the situation is actually not clear .",
    "the perturbations of other wave length , especially longer wave length exist and we can not just forget about them",
    ". the inclusion of those modes will give a contribution at higher order in perturbation theory ( fortunately not at the leading order ) .",
    "now we have determined the vacuum state , using a simple matching together with a more detailed discussion .",
    "the next step is to interpret and understand the solution .",
    "suppose we could measure the scalar field @xmath135 after the end of inflation , what shall we see ?",
    "we see random fluctuations and we want to extract statistical information from it .",
    "the way to do it is to consider the two point correlation function @xmath176 at @xmath177 ( the end of inflation ) . inserting the solution of the mode function",
    ", we have @xmath178 where @xmath179 is called the power spectrum .",
    "@xmath180 is the fluctuation amplitude of @xmath135 per hubble volume per hubble time .",
    "when @xmath179 does not dependent on @xmath157 ( as the current case ) , we call the power spectrum `` scale invariant '' .    the scale invariance of a power spectrum means if we zoom the fluctuations into a bigger volume , and compare with the true fluctuations in this bigger volume , statistically we can not find difference between those fluctuations .",
    "the `` zoom '' operation shows up in the above formula as the @xmath181 factor , as a normalization of the volume .",
    "note that in our present example , the dynamics of the perturbation is linear .",
    "linearity implies that all the odd - point correlation functions ( e.g. @xmath182 ) vanishes , and all the even - point correlation functions ( e.g. @xmath183 ) can be reduced trivially into their disconnect parts ( e.g. @xmath184permutations ) .",
    "thus the power spectrum carries all the statistical information about the perturbations . considering the unpredictable nature of quantum random phase ,",
    "@xmath179 is the unique function to connect theory and observations . as we shall show in later sections , in case of a non - linear theory ,",
    "the above is no longer true and the predictions can become much richer .",
    "the above discussion can be generalized to a massive spectator field . in the massive case ,",
    "the above discussions can be directly generalized .",

    "limit the solution returns to the same minkowski limit as discussed in the massless case .",
    "finally , we heuristically apply the above discussion of @xmath135 to the fluctuation of the inflaton .",
    "this `` application '' must be considered with a _ big caution _ that , considering that inflaton is the field that drives inflation , the inflaton fluctuation couples to gravity dynamically .",
    "thus it is dangerous and non - rigorous to assume the fluctuation of inflaton lives on a non - dynamical gravitational background .",
    "we will leave those issues to the next subsections .",
    "now we postulate that @xmath135 is the fluctuation of the inflaton field : @xmath189 where @xmath190 is small and has the same solution as @xmath135 .",
    "return to the intuitive picture of @xmath72 as a clock . during inflation , on super - hubble scales different parts of the universe temporarily lost casual contact with each other .",
    "it is the clock field within the hubble patch , instead of the impact from other parts of the universe , that controls the reheat time of the local universe .",
    "when @xmath72 has a fluctuation @xmath191 , @xmath191 brings an uncertainty to the clock .",
    "the time uncertainty , measured in hubble unit , is @xmath192 .",
    "this time difference may be conserved , considering different patches of the universe do not talk to each other .",
    "if we consider this @xmath193 as an observable , the power spectrum of @xmath193 is @xmath194 we shall see in the next sections how the above argument could be made rigorous .      in the last section , we considered a spectator scalar field . in that case",
    "we could operationally take @xmath140 keeping @xmath195 to be small .",

    "after one hubble time , a hubble volume self - reproduces into @xmath356 copies . if in one or more of those @xmath357 new hubble volumes , the inflaton field has greater value due to the large quantum fluctuation , the dynamics in those patches are driven away from the reheating surface .",
    "the self - reproduction continues and inflation will never globally end . this situation is known as eternal inflation @xcite .    during eternal inflation , when following an observer s comoving world line , the observer finds that inflation eventually ends locally .",
    "however , due to the lack of global end , the global structure of eternal inflation is analogue to that of de sitter space .    as in the case of de sitter space ,",
    "the semi - classical picture of cosmic perturbations break down during eternal inflation .",
    "again this is not only because of @xmath358 , and not only because of lack of global end of inflation , but also that the whole picture can not be trusted .    to see this , it is convenient to consider ( the slow roll analog of ) the static patch of de sitter space , instead of the frw patch . in the static patch , the metric can be written as @xmath359    the stretched horizon is defined as the surface with one more area unit compared with the classical horizon : @xmath360this definition is reasonable because stretched horizon @xmath361 , the gibbons - hawking temperature is the planck temperature .",
    "the temperature has a redshift @xmath362setting @xmath363 , one get the @xmath361 in equation ( [ eq : stretched ] ) .",
    "complementarity becomes important as soon as objects ( e.g. perturbation modes ) reach the stretched horizon .",
    "now we want to estimate when complementarity becomes important for slow roll inflation .",
    "roughly , we could use the result for pure de sitter space , and let @xmath80 vary with respect to time .",
    "now the field excitation propagate towards the stretched horizon and the stretched horizon is also expanding itself .",
    "one should compare which of the two goes faster .",
    "the field excitation near the stretched horizon falls towards the stretched horizon at speed of light : @xmath364 measured by an observer at the center , the stretched horizon itself moves at a velocity ( in terms of @xmath365 and @xmath31 ) as @xmath366here one should note that @xmath367 is local process near the stretched horizon thus there is a huge redshift factor .",
    "however , @xmath368 is measured at the center of static patch , thus @xmath369 when calculating @xmath368 .    to compare those velocities , one note",
    "@xmath370where @xmath371 is the power spectrum for curvature perturbation during inflation . for the observable stage of inflation , @xmath372 .",
    "thus during the observable stage of inflation the field excitations would never reach the stretched horizon .",
    "thus the apparent difference of the static patch and the frw patch is merely a coordinate transformation .",
    "however , for eternal inflation , @xmath353 .",
    "thus during eternal inflation the hubble radius is expanding so slowly that the field excitations could reach the stretched horizon .",
    "on the other hand , even one believed the semi - classical picture of eternal inflation , the density perturbation generated during eternal inflation could never be observed even in principle .",
    "this is because when the @xmath373 modes returns to the horizon , they form black holes .",
    "the global structure of spacetime is not accessible by an observer in a black hole @xcite .    to conclude this subsection ,",
    "when taking the de sitter space limit , one hits eternal inflation and a shift of semi - classical physical picture .",
    "the calculations of power spectrum and non - gaussianities are not affected ( although the de sitter approximation is used for the mode function ) , because the perturbations never reaches the stretched horizon .",
    "the inflaton is not the unique light field during inflation .",
    "instead , there is at least another light field ",
    "the gravitational waves @xcite ( for modern conventions , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of gravitational waves goes similarly to the scalar sector .",
    "one could either do a brute force calculation of the tensor part , or first calculate the ricci scalar on minkowski background and then do a conformal transformation into an inflationary background .",
    "the result is @xmath374 note that the traceless and transverse conditions eliminates 4 components from the 6 components of a symmetric 3-tensor .",
    "thus there are only 2 physical modes in @xmath375 .",
    "those two modes can be decomposed by introducing the polarization tensors @xmath376~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symmetric , traceless and transverse properties are carried over by @xmath377 and @xmath378 as @xmath379 further from the reality conditions we have @xmath380 and we have the freedom to normalize @xmath381 .",
    "the normalization we take is @xmath382 finally , we need to fix the ambiguity of decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tensor - dec ] ) . for this purpose , it is convenient to choose the two polarization tensors as the spin 2 eigenfunctions of rotation along the @xmath383-axis : @xmath384 those conditions fixes the function @xmath385 as a function of @xmath383 ( up to a phase ) .",
    "it is helpful to construct those polarization tensors in an explicit way . to do that , we make use of the rotational symmetry of the theory to first rotate @xmath383 to be @xmath386",
    ". then the polarization tensors are @xmath387 for a general @xmath157 , a 3-d rotation matrix is multiplied onto the above polarization tensors .    with the above decomposition",
    ", the action of the tensor mode becomes two decoupled components .",
    "theoretically this is because they are different irreducible representations .",
    "technically this is because @xmath388 .",
    "the tensor mode action takes the form @xmath389~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for each polarization mode , the action is the same as that of a massless spectator scalar field .",
    "thus @xmath390 the tensor power spectrum is defined as @xmath391    compared with eq .",
    "( [ eq : tensor - dec ] ) , we have @xmath392    to compare with the scalar power spectrum , a tensor to scalar ratio is defined and calculated as @xmath393 the observational constraint on @xmath365 is @xcite @xmath394    it is important to note that , unlike the scalar power spectrum ( [ eq : scalar - power ] ) , the tensor power spectrum ( [ eq : tensor - power ] ) does not depend on @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , @xmath395 is solely determined by @xmath80 , the energy scale of the inflationary perturbations . thus if the gravitational wave power spectrum is detected , we immediately know the inflationary hubble scale .    also , for the minimal single field inflation , the slow roll parameters @xmath105 and @xmath100 can be calculated as functions of observables @xmath306 and @xmath365 : @xmath396 thus measurements on @xmath306 and @xmath365 can be considered as measurements of the first two derivatives of the inflationary potential .",
    "especially , the sign of @xmath100 determines if the inflationary potential is convex or concave .",
    "the latter is favored by current data @xcite .",
    "one can plot the single field inflation models ( as a function of e - folding number ) as line intervals on a two dimensional @xmath306-@xmath365 plot .",
    "the spectral index of gravitational waves is @xmath397 note that both the very lhs and very rhs of the above equation are expressed in terms of observables .",
    "thus @xmath398 is a consistency relation for single field inflation .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , the tensor to scalar ratio is related to the distance that the inflaton rolled in field space during inflation .",
    "the inflaton s rolling distance per e - fold is @xmath399 thus in 60 e - folds , @xmath72 rolls a distance @xmath400 . in words ,",
    "large tensor to scalar ratio @xmath365 indicates a longer distance of inflaton s motion .",
    "this relation is known as the lyth bound @xcite .",
    "one can correspondingly classify inflation models into large field and small field models , with @xmath401 and @xmath402 respectively .",
    "as we have seen , the construction of inflation requires two types of light fields : the inflaton field and the gravitational waves .",
    "however , we know from qft that there are many other fields . what do other fields behave during inflation ? here we discuss several possibilities :    * _ gauge fields : _ non - interacting gauge fields in 3 + 1 dimension have a conformal symmetry . the action of a non - interacting gauge field can be written as ( take u(1 ) as an example ) @xmath403 note that @xmath404 does not really contain metric or covariant derivative .",
    "moreover , the scale factor dependence ( using conformal time ) in @xmath405 and @xmath406 cancels . thus the gauge field does not `` know '' it lives on an expanding background instead of on a minkowski background .",
    "this is due to the conformally flat nature of the frw metric . as a result ,",
    "the large scale fluctuations of the gauge field is suppressed by @xmath407 and thus not important or observable . + on the other hand , if for some reasons we want the gauge field to have large scale fluctuations , then we have to break the scale invariance of the field ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . * _ accidental , or other protected massless fields : _ in this case , our previous discussion of a spectator field in de sitter space applies . during each e - fold",
    ", the field has a fluctuation @xmath408 .",
    "thus on long time scales , the field has a random walk behavior @xmath409 .",
    "+ however , one should note that , it is not easy to have a massless field without a symmetry .",
    "this is because , without the protection from symmetry , the quantum corrections generates a mass for the field .",
    "for the same reason as the higgs mass hierarchy problem , the quantum correction for a unprotected mass parameter runs to the uv completion scale of the effective field theory .",
    "this generates a mass correction @xmath410 .",
    "if there is supersymmetry ( which has to be broken at hubble scale ) , the mass correction is brought down to @xmath411 . * _ field with a small mass @xmath412 : _ the dynamics of such a light field depends on the field value . if the field is located at the origin of the potential , there is no much difference between the current case and the case of @xmath413 . however , as we discussed , because of the random walk behavior , the field can not naturally stay at the minimum of the potential if there were a large amount of inflation before the observable stage . to estimate the field value",
    ", we note that there is a competition between the random walk and a classical roll - back of the field .",
    "the classical roll - back can be estimated using the field equation @xmath414 we may approximate @xmath80 to be constant ( considering that @xmath135 is not the field that drives inflation , which modifies @xmath80 ) . in this case , @xmath135 can be solved as @xmath415 thus at large field value , the field rolls back exponentially fast and can not random walk . on the other hand ,",
    "when the exponential factor is small , random walk dominates .",
    "given enough e - folds of inflation ( including inflation happened at the non - observable stage ) , the balance is reached at @xmath416 during the above time ( corresponds to @xmath417 e - folds ) , the field randomly walks by a distance @xmath418 this is the typical distance for @xmath135 , away from the origin . on large scales , the very light field forms a curvaton web @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the curvaton web can be analyzed in detail using the langevin equation and the fokker - planck equation . if there were no enough e - folds of inflation , a cutoff of e - folding number needs also to be imposed .",
    "+ at perturbation level , the present case share similar equations with the massless case .",
    "however , due to the non - trivial background motion , the conversion mechanism from entropy perturbation to the comoving curvature perturbation could be very model dependent .",
    "the definition of entropy perturbation together with the illustrations of mechanisms are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : curv - isoc - pert ] . *",
    "_ field with a small mass @xmath419 : _",
    "+ this case is again different from the @xmath412 case .",
    "this is because the @xmath135 field now rolls fast enough that it does affect the variation of the hubble parameter .",
    "thus both fields contribute to the background evolution . in this case",
    "we have multi - field inflation .",
    "* _ field with a mass @xmath420 : _ in this case , the @xmath135 field is heavy compared with the background energy scale  the inflaton mass .",
    "however , @xmath135 is not heavier than the energy scale of perturbations  the hubble scale .",
    "thus the field stays at the origin of the potential at the level of homogeneous and isotropic background , but the perturbations could couple to the inflaton and thus observable . in this case , we have quasi - single field inflation .",
    "+ note that if there is minimally broken supersymmetry during inflation , then the standard model fields should get a mass correction of order @xmath80 .",
    "this is known as the `` @xmath100-problem '' for the inflaton @xcite , and opens up a variety of possibilities for other fields . * _ massive fields with @xmath421 : _ those fields decouple from the light fields at the tree level . however , considering that inflation is uv - sensitive , it is still an open question if loop corrections would make the imprint from those very massive fields observable in the sky @xcite .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , linear perturbations already carry interesting information about the physics during inflation",
    ". however , the information that linear perturbation carries is quite limited .",
    "this is because , for each field , the power spectrum is a function of @xmath157 only .",
    "even worse , nearly scale invariance brings this function down to a few numbers with increasing difficulties to measure .",
    "for example , consider the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath193 .",
    "currently we have measured two numbers : the amplitude @xmath371 itself at a given @xmath157 , and the tilt @xmath311 .",
    "if there were no features in the power spectrum , even a third number ( the running of spectral index @xmath316 ) would be very difficult to measure .",
    "the gravitational wave sector is even worse .",
    "even the amplitude @xmath422 is not detected yet , leaving only an upper bound .",
    "if the above two numbers are the only things that one could get from inflation ( which actually comes directly from the nearly scale invariance of the background , not the detail dynamics ) , then it is very hard to distinguish between inflation and alternatives , or between inflation models , let alone to use inflation as an ultra high energy laboratory of physics .",
    "one expects quite a few possibilities to overcome the above lack of prediction problem .",
    "for example , a detection of tensor mode will be of much help .",

    "this is not the desired behavior when we decide to keep @xmath1000 as abstract . to solve this problem",
    ", we can define derivative operators ourselves .",
    "the definition should include linearity and the leibniz s rule for multiplication , without defining how to calculate @xmath1002 explicitly .",
    "it is also convenient to use the `` notation '' package to overload the @xmath1003 operator . *",
    "* dummy indices may conflict .",

    "( \\partial _ # \\partial _ # f)&[unique [ ] ] * ( \\partial _ # \\partial _ # f)&[unique [ ] ]       .... + then mathematica automatically assign different dummies for different terms .",
    "it is also not hard to write a function to simplify dummies .      in the code calculating the action of perturbations , one frequently need to integrate by parts . the situations can be divided into 2nd order or higher order actions , and spatial or temporal directions . for 2nd order spatial direction , one can go to momentum space to get rid of integration by parts .",
