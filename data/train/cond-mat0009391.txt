    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has become the most significant experimental tool for a search of the electronic structure , especially in the high temperature superconducting cuprates@xcite . in many theoretical and experimental interpretations ,",
    "the arpes data is often compared to the one - electron spectral function @xmath10 or vice versa . for a more satisfactory description of the photoemission , i.e. , if one is interested in various parameter dependencies or the line shapes of quasi - particle peaks , one must go beyond the spectral function@xcite . for it , we may need to consider the photoexcitation process governed by the dipole transition matrix@xcite and the extrinsic losses of the photoelectron on its way out to and through the surface@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we give the study of transition matrix effects in the photoemission , while the extrinsic losses from the dynamical scattering are not our concern because their contributions are in many cases smaller by orders of magnitude .",
    "the target systems are composed of charged linear chains , i.e. , one - dimensional metals .",
    "one - dimensional metal has been known for the extreme realization of electron correlation effects in that there are an exotic spin - charge separation and only collective modes , not the single - particle excitation@xcite .",
    "it has opened another paradigm different from fermi liquid and is called tomonaga - luttinger liquid . in an actual situation , a one - dimensional metallic state is very unstable toward an insulating state or very marginal between metallic and insulating states through charge and spin ordering .",
    "anyhow these one - dimensional chain systems have attracted considerable attentions especially since the discovery of high @xmath11 superconductors . among the high @xmath11 cuprates , yba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5 ( ybco ) and its family compounds have cuo@xmath3 chain structure as well as cuo@xmath4 plane .",
    "prba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5 ( pbco ) , among the ybco family cuprates , does not support superconductivity unlike other cuprates , which is suggested due to the hole depletion in cuo@xmath4 plane@xcite .",
    "additional holes are thought to be doped in the cuo@xmath3 chain , not in the cuo@xmath4 plane .",
    "in such a sense , pbco can probably be an archetype of tomonaga - luttinger - type one - dimensional system , which has revived much interests in the study of metallic chain system within the study of high @xmath11 cuprates ( pbco actually has a band gap opening possibly due to charge ordering in the chain@xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , another feasible usefulness of the metallic chain system in high @xmath11 superconductor physics is in the so called stripe phase observed in nd - substituted la@xmath6nd@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( nd - lsco)@xcite .",
    "the stripe phase is due to the formation of an ordered array of charged stripes which are also antiphase domain walls between antiferromagnetic ordered spins in the cuo@xmath4 planes , which gives the periodicity - doubling for spins compared to charges .",
    "recent arpes experiments for pbco@xcite have shown actual evidence for one dimensionality immersed in , but distinguishable from contributions from the two - dimensional cuo@xmath4 planes . in experiments , two kinds of dispersive band features",
    "are observed ; one is from the undoped cuo@xmath4 plane and the other is the doped cuo@xmath3 chain . especially in the one - dimensional - like features , the separation between charge and spin excitation is also suggested .",
    "it is a stimulating result of tomonaga - luttinger liquid that the low energy physics is dominated by uncoupled collective modes of charge and spin excitations , also called holons and spinons . in experiments",
    ", it is also found that , in addition to the spin - charge separation , one - dimensional characters ( particularly spinon parts ) are strongly dependent on the photon polarization and at the same time on the momentum perpendicular to the chain .",
    "the results for pbco should be also relevant to other one - dimensional insulator , srcuo@xmath4 , which has a weakly coupled double cu - o chain .",
    "it is very intriguing to find that the similar polarization and perpendicular momentum dependencies in arpes are observed in srcuo@xmath4 as well@xcite .",
    "these observations could be hardly explained by a single tomonaga - luttinger chain only , the additional effect probably needs incorporating , which motivated us to explore the dipole transition matrix related to the geometries of a chain system .",
    "the static stripe phases in nd - lsco also lead to an interesting puzzle on the electronic structures through arpes observations@xcite .",
    "prior to that , the neutron scattering experiments compellingly proposed that there should be the static stripe formation in nd - lsco and besides , the charged stripes be aligned with rotated by @xmath12 between two adjacent planes@xcite .",
    "the low binding energy electronic structure actually looks more or less one - dimensional in the sense that the spectral weight distribution is roughly understood as a superposition of two perpendicular chains .",
    "however , the suppression of @xmath13-wave nodal signal along the brillouin zone diagonal direction , particularly around the @xmath14 point , could not be satisfactorily explained without additional physics .",
    "we suggest one necessary ingredient could be from the dipole transition matrix including the interferences from different stripes .",
    "another noticeable point is that there have been no decisive evidences for tomonaga - luttinger liquid in the stripes phase unlike chains in pbco .",
    "therefore , in our study for nd - lsco , although we consider the matrix effects from one - dimensional system , we assume the simple fermi liquid for a single stripe having well - defined fermi point .",
    "further , whether each stripe is a fermi liquid or a tomonaga - luttinger liquid does not affect the conclusion of the present work because the calculated polarization and photon energy dependencies of arpes spectra come from the matrix element effects reflecting the interference of photoelectrons from different stripes .    in this work",
    ", we account for the dipole matrix effects for the semi - infinite ( @xmath15 ) three - dimensional array of metallic chains , whose green s function is considered .",
    "the slight photoelectron damping is taken into account in the simplest way .",
    "it is assumed that all the excitations including both charge and spin occur along the chain - direction , that is , the energy scale for the perpendicular excitation is very high .",
    "this means that we neglect the interchain ( interstripe ) interactions such as hybridization or coulomb interaction , which may exist in the actual system and also the fluctuation of chain or stripe perpendicular to it , which could be important in a dynamical stripe phase .",
    "we think of two configurations .",
    "first , we simply model the three - dimensional array of chains for pbco . on the other hand , for nd - lsco",
    ", we slightly extend the model and consider the three - dimensional chain array perpendicularly crossed in adjacent planes . for both configurations",
    ", the model is analytically tractable .",
    "the resulting spectra is determined by complicated interferences of chain contributions and thus the dipole matrix effects are geometric .",
    "the effects naturally give @xmath0- and @xmath1-dependent photoemission spectra , which is found consistent with the recent experiments .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "first we discuss the basic theory and the suitable starting point to account for the dipole transition matrix in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the model for pbco and discuss its results .",
    "we can see how the spectral function of luttinger liquid changes by the transition matrix .",
    "such changes are also found quite consistent with experiments . in sec .",
    "iv , we extend and constitute the model for nd - lsco and obtain the spectral weight distribution through the similar type of calculation .",
    "the calculation is also more or less consistent with the low energy weight distribution in experiments ( here we assume _ a priori _ metallic stripes ) in a limited case , which is from the interference among chains . in the final sec .",
    "v , we present the concluding remarks and give the outlook .",
    "to account for the dipole transition matrix in the photoemission spectral intensity , we follow pendrey s formula@xcite . its benefit is to treat only one - particle green s function without solving for any static stationary states . from pendrey s",
    "the photoemission intensity @xmath16 is @xmath17 [ ii1 ] m(*k*,e,)|g^+(e+)g^+(e)^g^-(e+ ) |*k * , where @xmath18 is the retarded or advanced one - particle green s function and @xmath19 the photoelectron state .",
    "the photoelectron state could be represented as a plane wave in the lowest approximation , even if the real photoelectron wave function may be damped through the scattering with possible excitations in the solid , i.e. , could be quite different from a plane wave except for in the very high energy region . in our study , assuming the solid occupies @xmath15 space , we take into account the damping in the simplest way by taking the photoelectron wave as a plane wave in the in - plane direction and a damped wave in the @xmath20-direction .",
    "this would not be a very good representation due to the anisotropy inherent in the system even in the in - plane direction@xcite .",
    "we would expect and show , nevertheless , this could catch the essential physics as it should have . then in eq.([ii1 ] ) we replace @xmath19 by @xmath21 , which is given as [ ii2 ] |**= e^-i*k*[(z)e^-i_z^z + ( -z)e^-ik_z z ] .",
    "@xmath22 is a complex number , @xmath23 , and thus the photoelectron gets damped .",
    "it is worth noting that a damped photoelectron state is the formal solution of the one - electron schrdonger equation [ ii3 ] ( _ * k*-h_0-)|*k*=0 , where @xmath24 is the self - energy operator involving the photoelectron - solid interaction . equation ( [ ii2 ] ) can be understood from the first approximation for its self - energy , @xmath25 .",
    "if we insert the plane wave states in eq.([ii1 ] ) , the photoemission matrix @xmath26 is dissolved as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the one - particle green s functions at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , and @xmath32 , we would get , assuming the linear polarized photon , [ ii5 ] ^||*k*^=(^ ) ( * k*^-*k*^ ) ,  = ( * k*,k_z ) .",
    "the low energy features in arpes for pbco are expected to be governed by the cuo@xmath3 chain . in a formula unit , @xmath33ba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5 ( @xmath33=rare earth ) has pairs of cuo@xmath4 planes between cuo@xmath3 chain layers . among those compounds , for the case of prba@xmath4cu@xmath3o@xmath5",
    ", various experimental@xcite and theoretical studies@xcite suggests that the cuo@xmath4 plane should not be doped , but the cuo@xmath3 chain doped . in this study",
    ", we do not consider the undoped cuo@xmath4 plane since its contributions will be pushed to high binding energies .",
    "the chains are along the @xmath34-direction ( @xmath35-axis )",
    ". then the formal green s function of the system in the real space representation can be written as [ iii1 ] g^(*r*,*r*^)=_s_mm^ , where @xmath36 are eigenstates of the system , @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is assumed to include both charge and spin degrees of freedom , while in the direction perpendicular to the chain the minimum excitation energy is assumed to be so high that @xmath39 or @xmath40 is taken the lowest localized one - dimensional state .",
    "besides , we assume the overlap between the chains is very small . then ,",
    "if we rewrite eq.([iii1 ] ) in a more explicit way , @xmath41 where we have assumed that @xmath42 is the surface and the first chain layer is positioned at @xmath43 . @xmath44 is an ordinary single - particle green s function in the luttinger liquid including both charge and spin degrees of freedom . in the luttinger model ,",
    "the single - particle green s function and its property are already well known@xcite .",
    "this trivial factorization of the luttinger green s function is thanks to the complete suppression of the perpendicular excitation by the starting assumption .",

    ", we attribute the high binding energy structure , the sharp peak dispersing between @xmath120 ev and @xmath121 ev to the charge excitation ( holon ) and the low binding energy structure , the threshold at @xmath122 ev to the spin excitation ( spinon ) .",

    "comparison of the simplest cases ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,0 ) for both polarizations ( figs.[fig : exz ] and [ fig : eyz ] ) shows the @xmath125(perpendicular momentum)-dependency clearly , whose behaviors are determined by the third term in eq.([iii19 ] ) , @xmath134 .",

    "indeed , the phase space showing the stronger spinon contribution is along @xmath137 rather than @xmath138 ( for @xmath139 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : eyz](b ) shows this asymmetry also successfully at least in a qualitative picture . in the calculations ,",

    "the obtained asymmetry is in fact weaker than the experiment and rapidly fades away as @xmath130 increases . in the figures , the absolute intensity variations with respect to several @xmath0 s would not be very reliable here because of many simplifications .",
    "nevertheless , our model of the 1/4-filled three - dimensional chain array is found to explain very well the one - dimensional behaviors , especially the relative charge and spin intensities , reflected in the recent arpes data .",
    "another one - dimensional insulator srcuo@xmath4 also has cu - o chains .",
    "even if there is a finite interchain coupling , it is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrachain coupling , which makes srcuo@xmath4 a one - dimensional compound . aside from several details , we find that the present calculations should be relevant to the srcuo@xmath4 system as well .",
    "in fact , the arpes experiment on srcuo@xmath4 shows that the qualitative behaviors are very similar to the pbco case ( see figs . 4 and 5 in ref.@xcite ) in that the spinon bands are more apparent in the case of large ( @xmath141 ) momentum perpendicular to the chain .",
    "in the so called stripe phase , there happens the one - dimensional spin - charge modulations in the two - dimensional cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "the stripe phase has attracted much attention in connection with its implication to high @xmath11 superconductivity since it was proposed from neutron scattering in nd - substituted la@xmath6nd@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( nd - lsco)@xcite .",
    "it has been also reported that the charge transport in nd - lsco is observed to be one - dimensional , also consistent with the static stripe phase formation@xcite .",
    "similar stripe signatures are observed in la@xmath142sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( lsco)@xcite despite of their dynamical natures , while the stripe phase in nd - lsco is considered static . in this section ,",
    "we extend the model described in the previous section and apply to the nd - lsco system .",
    "it is one of the key issues whether the stripe phase is intrinsically metallic or insulating . here , however , our study will proceed based on the simple assumption of metallic one - dimensional system . as assumed before",
    ", our model has completely suppressed the interchain ( interstripe ) interaction and out - of - chain excitation and may be more suitable for describing the static stripe phase .",
    "so nd - lsco will be preferred in our theory .",
    "nd - lsco has characteristic stripe ( one - dimensional ) phases , where the stripes in adjacent planes are rotated by @xmath143 , whose schematic sketch is given in fig.[fig : ndlsco - stripe ] .",

    "these additional complex structures have been suggested as the overlap of two - dimensional characters from stripe fluctuations on the simple one - dimensional stripe picture , namely as part of the two dimensional fermi surface . on the other hand ,",
    "such fluctuations were not considered in our study .    as shown in the figures",
    ", we do not stress the restricted agreement much .",
    "the stripe system , nd - lsco is a more complicated system compared to the chain system , pbco .",
    "the real electronic structure may consist of both one - dimensional and two - dimensional components .",
    "this is very important and can explain why the present approach is good for pbco , while less satisfactory for nd - lsco . the photon energy behavior in figs.[fig : pez ] and [ fig : gammapoint ] , however , provides outlook for further studies along the present line .",
    "the first thing may be to go beyond the primary plane wave assumption for the photoelectron",
    ". the photoelectron wave function should be in principle calculated using the scattering theory including the surface .",
    "also the excitation perpendicular to the stripes , neglected here , would introduce the surface green s function@xcite .",
    "we would then hopefully expect more correct transition matrix effects , and also more robust photon energy and polarization dependencies of the spectra .",
    "however , we do not mean here the matrix effect would be enough to understand experiments .",
    "we have regarded stripes as a collection of noninteracting metallic chains , but the interaction among the chains as well as the interaction between the chain and the two - dimensional background electronic structures may play a role essentially@xcite .",
    "we have studied the dipole matrix effects of the photoemission in the system of linear metallic chains for two characteristic configurations . assuming the chains ( stripes ) are perfectly one - dimensional by neglecting the transverse excitations and interchain interactions , we could write down the green s function of the total system . pendrey s formula enables us to manage the dipole matrix effects from knowledges of the single - particle green s function .",
    "the calculations are very well controlled by small parameters @xmath68 or @xmath76 .",
    "interesting @xmath0- and @xmath1-dependencies in the photoemission spectra in pbco system have been observed , which would be thought of as the transition matrix effects .",
    "we have evaluated the spectral intensities accounting for the dipole matrix in the system of chains based on the luttinger model .",
    "pbco is found to have one - dimensional chains which behave like tomonaga - luttinger liquid by recent arpes studies .",
    "for the photoemission formula , we have adopted the pendrey s formula .",
    "the relative intensities of separated holons and spinons depending on the wave vector @xmath0 ( anisotropies ) , or the photon polarization ( linear polarization , @xmath1 ) obtained in the study are found consistent with the recent experiments .",
    "it is also found that the present study would be applicable to another system having insulating cu - o chains , srcuo@xmath4 .",
    "we have also considered the system more extended than pbco .",
    "we have had interests in the static stripe phases observed in nd - lsco system . in experiments , their one - dimensional characters",
    "are observed from the spectral distribution in @xmath0-space , but not perfectly understood from the stripe picture alone .",
    "we have studied its deviations arising from the dipole matrix effects . in the same way as for pbco , we have calculated the integrated spectral distribution .",
    "we then found a distribution quite consistent with experiment ( for @xmath231 ) , where the intensity around the @xmath14 point or along the @xmath13-wave nodal directions is strongly suppressed .",
    "we have also found , however , another distribution showing a strong accumulation of intensities around the @xmath14 point depending on the photon energy . in the result ,",
    "two types of distributions appear alternatively as a function of photon energy .",
    "such more or less shaky behaviors may be due to the simple plane wave assumption for the photoelectron state . for @xmath240 , additional complex structures are more apparently observed in experiment .",
    "it is insisted that the system should consist of two components , both one - dimensional and two - dimensional characters even in the static stripe phase in nd - lsco@xcite .",
    "@xmath1-dependent behaviors in our calculations , however , come from the interferences of noninteracting stripes ( chains ) and may be expected not fully justified in the stripe system . in the stripe system much two - dimensional characters induced by stripe fluctuations and interactions of the stripes with the two - dimensional background exist unlike a pure chain system .",
    "this is the reason that our study is successful for pbco , whereas less successful in nd - lsco .",
    "finally , we may need to clarify the scope or limit for the present photoemission approach .",
    "we have thought of the noninteracting ( noninteracting among chains and also between chains and the rest of the system ) one - dimensional chains ( stripes ) for both pbco and nd - lsco .",
    "therefore , in such a sense , the matrix effects addressed in our study are purely geometric . this must be quite drastic approximations , but can be well consistent with our original purpose of studying the matrix effects .",
    "further investigations for the dipole matrix effect are suggested to take into account better considerations for the stripes ( allowing the transverse excitations ) and thus leading to the surface green s function , which would make it possible to describe the dynamical stripe phase too .",
    "we should also think of how good the plane wave for the photoelectron could be in these anisotropic systems .",
