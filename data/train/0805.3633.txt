    "the usual way to surmount the computational complexity of high reynolds number turbulent flows and the exorbitant grid resolution demands of high reynolds number turbulent flows is to average or filter the navier - stokes equations . with such pre - processing of the equations ,",
    "one ends up with unclosed stresses which need to be modeled . in large - eddy simulations ,",
    "the unclosed stresses are usually modeled with eddy - diffusivity type models .",
    "an alternative way of modeling is to smooth the dynamics of the navier - stokes equations by a direct modification of the advective terms @xcite .",
    "this allows one to derive the corresponding subscale model without any further assumptions , provided the employed filter @xmath9 is invertible .",
    "the modification can be chosen such that important physical properties of the navier - stokes equations are preserved , such as energy , helicity , the kelvin circulation theorem , or symmetries .",
    "the leray-@xmath0 model @xcite is the simplest regularization model . for this model , the advective operator @xmath10 is replaced by @xmath11 , where the filtered velocity @xmath12 and @xmath9 is a filter operation .",
    "historically , this model was used to prove existence and regularity of @xmath13 , as well as convergence to the navier - stokes solution as the filter width tends to zero @xcite .",
    "analytical estimates invoking prandtl - blasius arguments @xcite predict an excellent match for the laminar , transitional and turbulent regime , although the physical relevance of the solutions in the turbulent regime with respect to the boundary conditions and turbulence intensities may be questioned @xcite .",
    "the leray-@xmath0 model has been used for the simulation of the turbulent mixing layer , and showed superior accuracy in comparison with dynamic eddy - viscosity models , in particular with respect to the quality of the small resolved scales @xcite . the explicit filtering concept in les",
    "can be traced back to @xcite , although that model was originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian averaged navier - stokes-@xmath0 ( lans-@xmath0 ) model @xcite in addition , posesses a filtered kelvin circulation theorem .",
    "the lans-@xmath0 model has been successful in simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence @xcite and for the temporal mixing layer @xcite . a regularization approach which preserves",
    "the skew - symmetry of the advective operator has been recently proposed by @xcite . here , the energy , enstrophy ( in 2d ) and helicity are conserved , and accurate results are obtained with coarse simulations of plane channel flow .    given the excellent results obtained with the leray - alpha model the turbulent mixing layer @xcite , it is a natural step to assess whether the leray - alpha model performs as well for wall - bounded flows . in this paper",
    ", we study three canonical flow cases which represent a wide range of problems occuring in practical situations .",
    "the first is a plane channel flow , which is one of the standard test cases for turbulence models .",
    "the main production mechanism of turbulent kinetic energy for this flow is by shear production .",
    "the second test case is rayleigh - bnard convection , for which the turbulence is created purely by buoyancy production .",
    "this is a challenging test case because of the sensitive dependence of the heat - transfer on the turbulent dynamics .",
    "the third test case is a side heated vertical channel , for which turbulent kinetic energy is produced both by shear and buoyancy .",
    "this test - case is challenging because it exhibits counter - gradient turbulence heat and momentum fluxes @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we perform a coarse dns simulation for each flow case . the resolution for this simulation",
    "is chosen such that the turbulence statistics have degraded relative to the resolved dns solution , but the numerical solution is not dominated by wiggles .",
    "this simulation is then taken as the reference .",
    "the expectation is that the leray - alpha model will improve on these results by modifying the advective transport .",
    "the filter used to smooth the transport velocity is associated with the helmholtz operator , as proposed in the original formulation of the leray-@xmath0 model @xcite . in order to avoid excessive smoothing in the viscous and diffusive wall regions , a non - uniform filter width is used in the wall - normal direction , which is related to the local gridsize .",
    "the non - uniform filtering gives rise to a nonsolenoidal filtered velocity field .",
    "as shown in @xcite , a non - solenoidal velocity field gives rise to spurious production of tke very close to the wall , which degrades the performance of the leray-@xmath0 model . in order to circumvent this issue ,",
    "a projection method is used to ensure that the filtered velocity be solenoidal .",
    "the details of the leray-@xmath0 model are outlined in section [ par : leray ] .",
    "a preliminary study @xcite showed that for rayleigh - bnard convection , filtering with a constant filter size leads to an artificial thickening of the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer and significantly increased variances .",
    "as properly resolving viscous and diffusive wall region is of primary importance for wall - bounded flows , a space - varying filter size is applied in the wall - normal direction which scales with the grid resolution .",
    "this has implications for the velocity field , and the details about enforcing a divergence - free smoothed velocity field @xmath14 when using a space - varying filter @xcite are discussed in section [ par : divergencefree ] .",
    "the simulations for the channel flow , rayleigh - bnard convection and the side - heated convection are discussed in section [ par : results ] .",
    "the simulation of buoyancy - driven flows requires an extension of the momentum equation with the buoyancy force and an additional temperature equation .",
    "it turns out for the adopted formulation , the direct coupling between the turbulent heat - flux and the buoyancy production of turbulent kinetic energy is lost , which is particularly problematic for rayleigh - bnard convection ( section [ par : discussion ] and appendix [ app : rbexact ] ) .",
    "several suggestions are presented to correct for this undesired side effect .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section [ par : conclusions ] .",
    "the governing equations for the leray-@xmath0 model are @xmath15 with @xmath13 the velocity , @xmath16 the pressure , @xmath17 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath18 a body force . as can be seen in ( [ eq : leray ] ) , the regularization modeling approach results in a mixed formulation of filtered and unfiltered quantities . even though @xmath13 is unfiltered",
    "it should not be considered a velocity coming from direct numerical simulation ( dns ) because of the modified nonlinearity in .",
    "therefore , both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are regularized variables .",
    "the variable @xmath19 corresponds to the filter width which can have different values per direction and varies in the wall - normal direction .",
    "the filter @xmath9 is given by the inverse of the elliptic equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) and boundary conditions ; we will denote the filtering operation as @xmath20 this is the standard filter used for analytical studies of the leray-@xmath0 and lans-@xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "naturally , other filters could be used as well , as the effect of the filtering would ( hopefully ) be restricted to the small scales only .",
    "one advantage of using a formulation like ( [ eq : alpha ] ) is in the natural treatment of boundaries , as explicit filters require special treatment near the boundary .",
    "however , solving ( [ eq : alpha ] ) is quite costly , and care should be taken to ensure the incompressibility of the filtered velocity @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the leray-@xmath0 model does not add additional dissipation to the equations .",
    "indeed , the equation can be written in an les template as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the subfilter model , which is given by @xmath24 . here",
    ", @xmath25 is the high wavenumber part of @xmath13 .",
    "multiplying @xmath23 with @xmath13 results in @xmath26 , which shows that energy is only redistributed and not dissipated .",
    "one can also derive the implied subfilter scale model of the leray-@xmath0 model in terms of the filtered velocity @xmath21 . filtering ( [ eq : leray ] ) with @xmath9 leads to an explicitly filtered les template , given by @xmath27 but with a non - standard asymmetric subfilter term @xmath28     sketch of a typical spectrum for the unfiltered velocity @xmath13 of the leray-@xmath0 model.,width=226 ]    the leray-@xmath0 model reduces the number of active scales by slowing down the energy cascade at small scales .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] for the energy spectrum @xmath29 of unfiltered velocity .",
    "the wavenumber associated with the filter size is @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the energy cascade is unaffected which results in the classical @xmath32 spectrum .",
    "however , for @xmath33 , the filter affects the cascade time - scale and the spectrum is modified to @xmath34 . because of the higher variances at small scales , the dissipation will take place on larger scales than the kolmogorov scale with associated wave number @xmath35 .",
    "note that the energy density spectrum of the filtered velocity @xmath36 falls off steeply as @xmath37 beyond @xmath30 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "enforcing the incompressibility condition @xmath38 does not automatically ensure that @xmath39 for a wall - bounded flow . for uniform @xmath0 ,",
    "the solution @xmath40 of the homogeneous differential equation @xmath41 is nontrivial and does not vanish upon applying the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the main problem with @xmath42 is that the purely redistributive character of advection is lost , which can be demonstrated by considering the effect on the balance of the turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) .",
    "the turbulent transport of tke by fluctuations can be calculated by taking the advection term @xmath43 from the equation of velocity fluctuations , multiplying it by @xmath44 and averaging : @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side is in divergence - form and hence purely redistributive .",
    "the second term is a production / destruction term , which normally vanishes because the fluctuating field is divergence free .",
    "however , when @xmath42 this term can become nonzero , thereby allowing for spurious tke production and destruction . as was shown for rayleigh - bnard convection at @xmath47 and @xmath3 ,",
    "the term @xmath48 is responsible for significant energy production in the hydrodynamic boundary layer ( up to 25% of the volume - averaged production)@xcite .",

    "therefore , the divergence of the filtered velocity is given by @xmath52 u_j + { \\mathcal{l}}(0)\\ ] ] this shows both ways in which @xmath21 can cease to be divergence - free .",
    "first the commutator may not vanish because of a nonuniform filter width @xmath53 .",
    "second , the term @xmath54 is nonzero when the solution @xmath40 of the homogeneous differential equation @xmath41 does not yield @xmath55 after applying the boundary conditions , as discussed above . in @xcite ,",
    "several methods were proposed to maintain a nondivergent @xmath14 field : enforcing @xmath56 directly ( and thus dropping @xmath57 ) , letting @xmath0 vanish at the wall , using free - slip boundary conditions for @xmath14 and introducing a projection method . of these four options ,",
    "only the projection method can be successfully applied for nonuniform filters @xmath53 , so this is a convenient choice . the projection method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) adds a gradient @xmath58 to ( [ eq : flt ] ) as @xmath59 and solves a poisson equation @xmath60 to make @xmath61 incompressible .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on @xmath14 and @xmath62 are equivalent to the conditions imposed on @xmath13 and @xmath16 ; @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "with the projection included , the filtered velocity @xmath14 is related to the unfiltered velocity @xmath13 by a filter @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the projection operator .",
    "note that @xmath65 takes the complete velocity vector as its argument , as opposed to @xmath9 which only requires one velocity component at a time .",
    "the grid resolution is normally a good indication for the location of the most demanding flow features .",
    "therefore , we couple the filter size @xmath19 directly to the grid resolution by a parameter @xmath6 as @xmath68 note that the filter size is anisotropic . in the wall - normal direction ,",
    "the grid is clustered towards to wall so that the filter is small near the wall and larger in the midplane .",
    "the smoothing parameter @xmath6 is varied between @xmath69 , for which the typical filter width spans up to four grid cells .",
    "this can be shown by calculating the filter width @xmath70 from @xcite : @xmath71    where @xmath72 is a normalized filter kernel .",
    "the free - space green s function associated with the helmholz equation is @xmath73 substitution of the above expression and into leads to @xmath74 .",
    "the projection method has been implemented in our code for direct simulation as a two - step process . in the first step , the elliptic equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) is solved by a direct method which takes advantage of the homogeneous directions . in the second step , the projection method is used to make this field divergence free .",
    "the code is based on staggered finite differences and uses second order central differences in space and a second order adams - bashforth scheme in time @xcite .",

    "the grid has been chosen such that the grid is too coarse for a good solution without a subgrid model , but fine enough so that the solution is not dominated by wiggles .",

    "the subfilter scale model would ideally compensate this effect .",

    "it should be noted that part of this increase is due to the normalisation : the decrease in the friction velocity causes @xmath102 to become larger .",
    "however , even without scaling , the variance increases a factor 2.5 when comparing the resolved dns results to the leray - alpha simulation at @xmath103 .",
    "the peak in @xmath102 can be seen to shift outwards , indicating a thickening of the viscous wall region .",
    "the probable mechanism for a thickening of the viscous wall region resides in the modification of the momentum - flux @xmath104 in the buffer layer .",

    "a significant increase in the variance occurs for the large wavenumbers as well .",
    "it should be noted that in the midplane , the difference between the dns and the leray-@xmath0 model is relatively small ; in the viscous wall region , the difference would be even greater .",
    "more insight into the enhanced variances may be obtained by studying the budget for turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) .",
    "the equation of tke can be obtained by multiplying the fluctuating part of ( [ eq : leray ] ) by @xmath107 and averaging over the homogeneous directions and over time .",

    "the smoothed transport velocity directly modifies the shear production term @xmath112 and the transport of the velocity fluctuations @xmath115 .",
    "the fact that the variance increases while the production of tke remains roughly the same is one of the intriguing features of the leray - alpha model . because of the attenuation of small - scale dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) , it is to be expected that the total variance will increase due to a slowing down of the cascade at high wavenumbers .",
    "a recent study @xcite suggests that the variance accumulation at subfilter scales is even higher ; for the lans - alpha model , the small scales seem to behave as `` rigid rotators '' which are advected passively by the larger scales .",

    "the velocity profile remains at roughly the same amplitude as for @xmath173 but here a kink can be observed in the mean velocity around @xmath174 , which is not present in the other simulations .",
    "this kink is responsible for the shift of the shear production term @xmath175 from the center to the near - wall region .",
    "the results for @xmath176 as a function of @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc]c .",
    "the increase in the average velocity does not influence @xmath127 very much for the coarse dns .",
    "the trend for increasing @xmath6 is that @xmath127 decreases , similar to rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "around @xmath88 , @xmath127 is at its expected value , and above this value , @xmath127 is underpredicted .",
    "the shear reynolds number @xmath98 is defined as @xmath177 .",
    "the influence of @xmath6 is relatively small for this flowcase ( fig.[fig : lhc]d ) , with an underprediction of @xmath98 of 10% at @xmath99 .    the streamwise velocity variance profile @xmath150 is shown in fig .  [ fig : lhc]e , nondimensionalized by @xmath178 .",
    "the coarse dns overestimates the variance by 50% in the bulk . here",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath6 is to decrease the variance for @xmath88 .",
    "as @xmath6 is increased further , the variance becomes practically constant in the bulk ( @xmath149 ) , after which the maximum shifts from the center to the near - wall region ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the equation of tke for the side - heated vertical channel is given by @xmath179 for this flow case , there is production of tke both by shear and by buoyancy .",
    "both components of @xmath112 are shown as a function of @xmath180 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc]f . here",
    ", it can be seen that the lack of resolution mainly affects the shear - production term @xmath181 through the overestimation of the average velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc]b ) .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath6 reduces the shear - production and the production is estimated appropriately at @xmath149 . at @xmath99 ,",
    "the buoyancy production term changes little with respect to @xmath149 , but the shear production term changes dramatically .",
    "the simulations show two major trends .",
    "first , gradients at the wall ( as reflected in integral quantities like @xmath98 and @xmath127 ) tend to decrease . both for rayleigh - bnard convection and the side - heated vertical channel , coarse dns overpredicts wall gradients , and the leray-@xmath0 model can improve results . in the case that coarse",
    "dns underpredicts gradients at the wall , as for the plane channel flow , the leray-@xmath0 model does not improve the results .",
    "second , the variances tend to increase as a function of @xmath0 , specifically at the low and intermediate wavenumbers . in view of the model spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) , which predicts an increase in the variance at wavenumbers larger than @xmath30 only , this may be quite surprising",
    ". however , this seems to be an intrinsic property of the leray-@xmath0 model .",
    "simulations with the leray-@xmath0 model in absence of walls @xcite also results in enhanced variances and the low and intermediate wave lengths . the presence of walls does not change this property . however , the presence of a wall seems to enhance this feature of the model , due to an increase in the turbulent shear production term .    in simulations with coarse grids , a significant part of the fluctuations",
    "are sub - grid , and separate modeling may be required ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , a pragmatic solution to remedy the increased variances may be to add some extra diffusion to the model .",
    "this may be done in several ways : 1 ) by using a simple eddy - viscosity model ; 2 ) by using a dynamic smagorinsky procedure ; and 3 ) by using a spectral dissipation procedure .",
    "it is clear that this procedure would have to be done with care , as one could easily overwhelm the leray-@xmath0 contribution to the subfilter stress .",
    "the tensor - diffusivity model ( also called clark model ) @xcite , is a good example of a model which significantly benefits from some additional dissipation .",
    "this filter reproduces approximately 90% of the subfilter stresses in _ a priori _ studies .",
    "however , in _ a posteriori _ studies , the tensor diffusivity model requires additional dissipation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , extra dissipation may be unavoidable to be able to use leray-@xmath0 with relatively coarse meshes . in this study ,",
    "the resolution was chosen such that coarse dns simulations were incapable of reproducing correct statistics but were not dominated by wiggles .",
    "when even coarser grids would have been used , the absence of additional dissipation leads to a deterioration of the results of the leray-@xmath0 model .    in this study we chose to keep the filter as close as possible to the original formulation @xcite .",
    "the filtering requires inverting a helmholtz equation for all three velocity components , which is computationally expensive .",
    "in addition , the projection step to make @xmath14 divergence - free requires solving another poisson equation . even though the computational overhead for solving a poisson equation is minimized by using ffts in the homogeneous directions , this procedure is more expensive than conventional sgs models . to reduce the number of operations",
    ", one could use explicit filters @xcite or apply ( [ eq : flt ] ) but with only one or two jacobi iterations @xcite .",
    "an important question for future research is related to the influence of the filter type .",
    "it is not inconceivable that an explicit filter ( i.e. a filter that does not require solving a poisson equation , such as a top - hat filter ) might perform better than the helmholtz filter . indeed",
    ", the helmholtz filter suffers from @xmath182 even for uniform @xmath0 , which violates the filtering framework @xcite .",
    "a projection method was required to remedy this problem .",
    "in addition , the helmholtz filter does not have compact support , causing the filtered velocity to be influenced relatively strongly by large fluctuations far away .",
    "the inclusion of the buoyancy term in the leray-@xmath0 model has to be done with care .",
    "in the direct simulations of rayleigh - bnard convection , the average buoyancy production @xmath183 is constant in the bulk , as @xmath112 depends directly on the turbulent heat flux @xmath144 ( which is constant in the bulk ) .",
    "this is not the case for the leray-@xmath0 model , where a peak in @xmath112 is created near the hydrodynamic boundary layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rb]e ) .",
    "this change is a direct consequence of the modification of the turbulent heat flux . in the present formulation ( [ eq : leray2]-[eq : theta2 ] ) , the direct coupling between tke production and heat - flux is broken , as the equations for tke and average heat - flux are given by ( see also appendix [ app : rbexact ] ) : @xmath184 the buoyancy production term is given by @xmath185 , while the turbulent heat flux ( which is constant in the bulk ) is given by @xmath186 ( [ eq : rb_heatflux ] ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath144 and @xmath186 can be calculated by substituting @xmath187 ( and therefore not correcting for compressibility effects discussed in sec .",
    "[ par : divergencefree ] ) into @xmath144 results in @xmath188 interestingly , the two extra terms on the right - hand side correspond to terms typically encountered in the transport equation of @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "the first is normally associated with the molecular diffusive transport , and the second with the dissipative cross - correlation term , although the sign is opposite here .    for buoyancy driven flows , the variation of @xmath0 as a function of the wall - normal coordinate @xmath77 seems be of importance for the variation of @xmath112 over the vertical in the bulk .",
    "indeed , the preliminary simulations with constant @xmath0 ( and free - slip conditions for @xmath21 ) did not have a variation of @xmath112 over the height @xcite . at @xmath173 , the difference of @xmath112 between the peak value at the edge of the boundary layer and the core is 10% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rb]e ) .",
    "this is quite a large difference , and it seems worthwhile to explore whether this effect can be circumvented .",
    "the first and most obvious way is to experiment with different filters .",
    "another option is to modify the temperature equation . instead of holding on to the same advection operator for all transported quantities",
    ", one could apply the modified advection operator @xmath189 to the momentum equations only . for the other transported quantities ,",
    "@xmath190 could be used , with the understanding that @xmath191 is also a regularized velocity .",
    "this would directly restore the coupling between the turbulent heat - flux and the buoyancy production .",
    "however , the danger in a formulation like this may be an excess of variance at small scales , which results in a high - wavenumber forcing contaminating the simulation .",
    "numerical simulations of the leray-@xmath0 model have been carried out for plane channel flow , rayleigh - bnard convection and the side - heated vertical channel .",
    "the simulations have been compared to dns and coarse dns . in general , the simulations show two trends .",
    "first , the viscous ( and diffusive ) wall region tends to thicken as a function of the filter width parameter @xmath6 , which causes wall gradients such as the shear stress or the heat - flux to decrease .",
    "when coarse dns overpredicts wall gradients , such as for rayleigh - bnard convection and ( to a lesser extent ) the side - heated vertical channel , the leray-@xmath0 model can improve the results .",
    "however , when the gradients are initially underestimated , such as for the plane channel , results do not improve . here , additional wall - modeling",
    "may be needed to enhance turbulence levels in the near - wall region .",
    "second , the variance at low and intermediate wavenumbers increases upon increasing the filter size parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this leads to overpredicted variance in the velocity field which is undesired .",
    "an important point for buoyancy driven flows is how to include a temperature forcing into the leray - alpha model .",
    "indeed , the intuitive extension ( [ eq : leray2]-[eq : theta2 ] ) causes the production of tke by buoyancy to be no longer directly coupled to the turbulent heat - flux . for rayleigh - bnard convection",
    ", this leads to a varying tke production in the bulk ( and as a function of @xmath6 ) .    in this paper , the performance of the leray-@xmath0 model was assessed for three wall - bounded flows .",
    "the leray-@xmath0 model was implemented in its original form , i.e. with the helmholtz filter .",
    "this study indicates that , within this formulation , the potential of the leray - alpha model is rather limited for wall - bounded flows .",
    "indeed , the overpredicted variances , in particular the accumulation of energy on the low and intermediate wavenumbers pose a challenge for accurate predictions with the leray-@xmath0 model . a study on alternative filter types , potentially remedying the aforementioned downsides of the helmholtz filter , would be a valuable next step .",
