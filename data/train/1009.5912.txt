    "hence , @xmath192 is a @xmath70-face adjacent to a trigon .",

    "assume first that @xmath18 is @xmath84-big .",
    "hence , only rules rmd , rt and rb can apply to @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath18 is adjacent to no trigon , then @xmath18 sends out at most @xmath206 units of charge . since the initial amount of charge of @xmath18 is @xmath207 ( recall @xmath183 ) , the final charge of @xmath18 is non - negative .",

    "hence , rule rt applies at most @xmath209 times and rules rmd , rt and rb together apply at most @xmath208 times .",
    "consequently , @xmath18 sends out at most @xmath210 units of charge .",
    "the value of ( [ eq - final - face ] ) is at most @xmath211 unless @xmath212 . by considering the number of bigons and trigons adjacent to @xmath18",
    ", we derive that @xmath18 sends out at most the amount of its initial charge unless one of the following cases applies ( recall that one of the edges incident to @xmath18 is not in a multigon and no two trigons can share a vertex ) :    1 .   *",

    "we now prove the following claim :      if @xmath222 , the estimate ( [ eq - final - face - toobig ] ) follows from the fact that no face or multigon receives more than @xmath176 units of charge from @xmath18 .",

    "this implies that @xmath18 is @xmath71-big , i.e. , @xmath230 which contradicts the assumptions .",
