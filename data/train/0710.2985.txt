    "@xcite for two recent reviews .    in view of the difficulties to describe all data with `` standard '' sterile neutrino oscillations i assume in this note that the sterile neutrino is a more exotic particle than just a neutrino without weak interactions . being a singlet under the standard model gauge group it seems possible that the sterile neutrino is a messenger from a hidden sector with some weired properties .",
    "i will assume in the following that the mass or the mixing of the fourth neutrino depends in a non - standard way on the neutrino energy .",
    "the motivation is that the neutrino energy in lsnd is around 40  mev , whereas miniboone and the cdhs disappearance experiment operate around 1  gev , and hence changing the energy dependence of oscillations will have some impact on the fit .    to be specific",
    ", i am going to assume that either the mass @xmath7 or the mixing @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) of the fourth neutrino state depends on the neutrino energy @xmath10 like @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mass and the mixing at a reference energy @xmath14 , and for the exponent @xmath15 i will consider values in the interval @xmath16 .",

    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) involves only the new fourth mass state , whereas masses and mixing of the three active standard model neutrinos are assumed to be constant .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "before discussing qualitatively the phenomenological consequences of med and edm oscillations according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) let me briefly remind the reader about the description of short - baseline ( sbl ) neutrino oscillation data in the case of standard four - neutrino oscillations . in the so - called ( 3 + 1 ) schemes",
    "there is a hierarchy among the mass - squared differences : @xmath19 under the assumption that @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be neglected sbl oscillations are described by two - flavour oscillation probabilities with an effective mixing angle depending on the elements of the lepton mixing matrix @xmath22 and @xmath23 . for @xmath5 appearance experiments the effective mixing angle is given by @xmath24 whereas for a @xmath25 disappearance experiment we have @xmath26 see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the amplitude responsible for the lsnd appearance is a product of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , whereas @xmath27 and @xmath28 disappearance experiments constrain these elements separately leads to the well - known tension between lsnd and disappearance experiments in the ( 3 + 1 ) oscillation schemes , see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "assuming now an energy dependent mass for @xmath29 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , it turns out that for the range of parameters and energies relevant for our discussion it is always possible to take @xmath29 much heavier than the three standard neutrinos , @xmath30 , such that the usual sbl approximation eq .",
    "( [ eq : hierarchy ] ) remains always valid , and the energy scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) applies also for the mass - squared difference @xmath31 .",
    "then the relevant oscillation phase @xmath32 gets a different energy dependence than in the standard case : @xmath33 hence the standard @xmath17 dependence gets altered to @xmath18 .",
    "the most relevant consequence of the med with @xmath34 follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : osc_phase ] ) : an experiment is sensitive to oscillations if @xmath35 , or @xmath36 hence , for experiments with @xmath37 the allowed region will be shifted to larger values of @xmath38 as compared to the standard oscillation case ( @xmath39 ) , whereas the allowed region for experiments with @xmath40 will be shifted to smaller @xmath38 , in order to compensate for the factor @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : loe ] ) .    using instead of the med now the energy dependence of the mixing matrix elements from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , one obtains for the sbl appearance and disappearance amplitudes given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) and ( [ eq : dis ] ) : @xmath42 this introduces only a mild distortion of the oscillation pattern from the standard oscillatory behaviour with @xmath17",
    ". the main effect of edm is that the sensitivity of experiments with @xmath43 to the effective mixing angle gets weaker .",
    "let us note that the edm scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) can not hold for arbitrarily low energies , simply because of unitarity of @xmath44 .",
    "the low energy limit of the edm scaling should find an explanation in some theory for this effect . here",
    "i assume that for the parameter range relevant for the sbl analysis the power - law scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) remains valid .",
    "note that in both cases , med and edm , for fixed @xmath15 the choice of the reference energy @xmath14 is arbitrary . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : osc_phase ] ) it is clear that choosing a different reference energy @xmath14 leads just to a rescaling of @xmath12 such that the combination @xmath45 remains constant .",
    "similar , changing @xmath14 in case of the edm leads just to a rescaling of the @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the ( 3 + 1 ) med and edm models have one phenomenological parameter in addition to the ( 3 + 1 ) standard oscillation model : @xmath47    the main effects of med and edm oscillations can be summarized in the following way : consider the allowed regions of the various experiments for standard oscillations in the plane of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "introducing now med ( edm ) leads to a relative shift of the regions of experiments at different energies along the @xmath38 ( @xmath50 ) axis .",
    "the relevant sbl experiments are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : experiments ] , ordered according to their mean neutrino energy . for convenience",
    "i will choose @xmath51  mev , corresponding roughly to the mean neutrino energy in lsnd .",
    "since in miniboone the neutrino energy is higher , for med ( edm ) oscillations the sensitivity is shifted to larger values of @xmath38 ( @xmath52 ) for @xmath53 . in the med framework miniboone operates actually at a too small value of @xmath6 in order to test lsnd .",
    "as i will show in the following , in both cases the two experiments become compatible for @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that also the global fit including all the experiments listed in the table improves significantly due to the different energy regimes .",
    ".[tab : experiments ] experiments used in the sbl analysis .",
    "the oscillation channel , and the number of data points used in the fit ( `` data '' ) are given .",
    "the last column shows the approximate mean neutrino energy for each experiment . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of such a pg analysis are displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab : pg ] .",
    "first , the compatibility of lsnd and all the remaining no - evidence sbl data is tested , and the pg is compared within the standard , the med , and the edm oscillation frameworks .",
    "the consistency improves drastically from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( med ) or @xmath56 ( edm ) .",
    "the probability value in the med case corresponds to a tension of slightly less than @xmath57 .",
    "second , as an alternative test i check the compatibility of the three data sets lsnd , no - evidence appearance data , and disappearance data .",
    "similar a huge improvement of the consistency from @xmath58 for standard oscillations to 3% ( med ) or 5% ( edm ) is found .",
    "although both of these two tests clearly show an improvement of the fit with respect to standard oscillations , the low probabilities still indicate that the global fit is not perfect and some tension remains in the data .",
    "the reason for this is the tension between karmen and lsnd , which is the same as in the standard oscillation case , since these experiments have the same energy .",
    "the allowed regions in the space of oscillation parameters of these two experiments have clearly an overlap , and a careful combined analysis came to the conclusion that they are consistent  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there remains a tension between them which is detected by the rather sensitive pg test . in the last row of tab .",
    "[ tab : pg ] i consider the case when lsnd and karmen are combined to one single data set ( which includes also nomad ) , and test the consistency of this set against miniboone and disappearance data .",
    "this corresponds to the data sets shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : med ] and [ fig : edm ] , and since lsnd and karmen are included in the same data set the tension between them does not show up in the pg .",
    "in this case the pg shows a perfect consistency of all data with probablities of 18% and 35% for med and edm , respectively , whereas the probablitiy of standard oscillations remains unacceptably low .      before concluding this section i comment briefly on the event excess observed in miniboone in the energy region below 475  mev . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , standard two - flavour oscillations can not account for the sharp rise at low energy .",
    "however , since in the med scenario the energy dependence of oscillations is modified according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : osc_phase ] ) one may expect that an explanation of the excess becomes possible .",
    "indeed i find that for values of the exponent @xmath59 the rise of the oscillation probability becomes steep enough and a perfect fit to the full spectrum including the excess between 300 and 475  mev becomes possible . for such large values of @xmath15",
    "a closed allowed region appears in the plane of @xmath38 and @xmath48 for miniboone data ( not only a bound ) .",
    "however , because of the large @xmath15 value this allowed region appears at @xmath38 values above the lsnd region and the karmen bound . hence",
    ", although a modified energy dependence like considered here allows in principle for an explanation of the low energy event excess , this solution is not compatible with lsnd and the karmen bound , and in the global analysis the excess can not be fitted .",
    "for this reason i used in the analysis only the miniboone data above 475  mev  @xcite , and rely on an alternative explanation of the low energy event excess .",
    "in this section i briefely comment on other phenomenological implications of the med / edm schemes . in general the scenarios considered here",
    "are difficult to test at future neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "no appearance signal is expected for miniboone anti - neutrino data , which currently are being accumulated , since the energy dependence is assumed to affect anti - neutrinos in the same way as neutrinos . in order to test the lsnd signal for a med with @xmath60 at the given miniboone baseline",
    "one would need to run at an energy of @xmath61 which seems not practicable because of low cross sections and large backgrounds",
    ". a similar signal as in standard ( 3 + 1 ) or ( 3 + 2 ) oscillations is expected also in the med scenario for future reactor experiments , see ref .",
    "a promising place to look for effects of med oscillations could be the 2  km detector proposed for the t2k experiment  @xcite . with a mean neutrino energy of 0.7  gev",
    "this detector is slightly too far from the neutrino source to cover the oscillation maximum in case of standard oscillations with @xmath62  ev@xmath63 .",
    "however , with the med best fit point from eq .",
    "( [ eq : best - fit ] ) the oscillation phase according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : osc_phase ] ) turns out to be close to @xmath64 at @xmath65  km .",
    "a rather model independent test of med or edm explanations of lsnd would be an experiment operating at the same energy as lsnd , such as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . furthermore , to test the edm scenario one would like to perform experiments at energies as small as possible .",
    "in particular , this model predicts relatively large effects for @xmath28 disappearance for experiments at energies smaller than 1  gev , since the ev - scale mass state has a rather large mixing with @xmath28 at 40  mev , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : best - fit ] ) .",
    "let us note that unitarity requires @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the power law energy dependence of edm can not hold down to arbitrarily low energies . at the best fit values given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : best - fit ] ) , one finds @xmath67 at @xmath68  mev and @xmath69 at @xmath70  mev .",
    "is needed at few  mev energies , whereas @xmath71 is evaluated only for @xmath72  mev . ] in order to use the edm framework for very low energies one would have to specify the energy dependence of the neutrino mass matrix , and obtain the mixing angles via the diagonalisation , such that unitarity is always guaranteed .",
    "this is especially relevant , for example , to obtain predictions for neutrino mass experiments from tritium beta - decay , which has an end point energy of 18.6  kev .",
    "as in case of standard sterile neutrino mixing , also in the med / edm framework the sterile neutrinos have implications for cosmology and astrophysics , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in general",
    "the effects will be very similar to the standard case with effective masses and mixing evaluated according to the relevant neutrino energy .",
    "for example , in a supernova and in big bang nucleosynethesis ( bbn ) the neutrino energy is close to ( or slightly below ) the reference energy 40  mev used above , and therefore the mixing parameters shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : best - fit ] ) roughly apply in these environments .",
    "this implies that  as in the standard ( 3 + 1 ) case  the sterile neutrino will be brought into thermal equilibrium via oscillations prior to bbn  @xcite .",
    "cosmology provides a bound on the sum of the neutrino masses in the sub - ev range  @xcite , mainly from the power spectrum at large scales combined with precise data on the cosmic microwave background . in general this bound implies a challenge for sterile neutrino schemes relevant for lsnd .",
    "the conflict becomes particularly severe for the med framework , since here the neutrino mass increases with decreasing neutrino energy , which implies large masses for cosmological relevant neutrinos .",
    "let us note , however , that depending on the particular model realisation of med one can expect that the power law scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) does not continue down to arbitrarily low energies . here",
    "i assume only that it holds in the energy interval relevant for sbl experiments , i.e. , above about 1  mev , and it might be altered at lower energies .",
    "before concluding i give here some speculative thoughts on possible reasons for a power law scaling of sterile neutrino masses or mixing . without doing any detailed model building",
    "i just mention a few possibilities where such a behaviour might occur .    indeed , energy dependent neutrino masses and mixing",
    "are a very familiar phenomenon in the framework of the standard matter effect  @xcite .",
    "since the effective matter potential depends on the neutrino energy the mass eigenstates and mixing angles in matter depend on the energy .",
    "an analogous mechanism would be at work for the sterile neutrino if it interacts with some un - known background field or has some special interactions with standard matter .",
    "such a possibility has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite and explored recently in ref .",
    "the interaction postulated for the sterile neutrino should be several orders of magnitude stronger than usual weak interactions in order to be relevant at the short baselines in lsnd or miniboone . in these models",
    "neutrinos and anti - neutrinos interact differently and therefore they will have a different energy dependence .",
    "this may change the null - prediction for the miniboone search with anti - neutrinos mentioned in the previous section .",
    "an energy dependence similar to a matter potential occurs also in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , where sterile neutrinos are allowed to take shortcuts through particularly shaped extra dimensions .",
    "effectively this leads to a modification of the dispersion relation of the sterile neutrinos which introduces a non - standard energy dependence on active  sterile oscillations .",
    "in general also a violation of the lorentz symmetry such as considered for example in ref .",
    "@xcite leads to oscillations with an energy dependence different from the standard one .",
    "another motivation for energy dependent neutrino masses and/or mixing could be the idea of `` unparticle '' physics  @xcite .",
    "one assumes the existence of a scale invariant sector with a non - trivial infrared fixed point coupled to the standard model through non - renormalizable operators",
    ". such operators may have large anomalous dimensions and hence introduce power - law running of coupling constants .",
    "for example , suppose a fermionic unparticle operator @xmath73 with mass - dimension @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , which has the quantum numbers of a right - handed neutrino ( and hence is a gauge singlet )",
    ". then one can write a `` mass term '' @xmath76 , where @xmath25 can be either an active left - handed neutrino , or a `` standard '' sterile neutrino .",
    "the dimension of @xmath77 is @xmath78 with the anomalous dimension @xmath79 . assuming that the coupling of @xmath73 with @xmath25 is scale invariant implies that the effective `` masses '' at two energy scales @xmath80 and @xmath81 are related by @xmath82 .",
    "this resembles the scaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , relating the phenomenological parameter @xmath15 in the above analysis to the anomalous dimension of the unparticle operator .",
    "the physical neutrino masses have to be found as poles in the corresponding propagator .",
    "these arguments provide a hint that the unparticle framework might lead to the exoting energy dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) ; whether it is indeed possible to obtain a valid model for med and/or edm active  sterile neutrino oscillations using unparticles needs further investigation , which is beyond the scope of this work .    via the so - called ads / cft correspondence effects from a conformal sector such as mentioned above",
    "might actually have an interpretation also in theories with extra spacetime dimensions . in such models couplings",
    "can exhibit power law running  @xcite .",
    "if the neutrino mass is generated through a mechanism involving extra dimensions  @xcite their masses and mixing may depend on energy through these running effects .",
    "usually the scale of new physics in extra dimensional models is around or above the tev energy scale . in order to be relevant for the lsnd / miniboone problem one has to assume that the mechanism responsible for the power law running can be extended to the energy scale relevant for the experiments under consideration ( mev to gev ) in the active  sterile neutrino sector .    at this point",
    "i will not go into further details and leave the question whether indeed a full model for med or edm oscillations can be constructed from any of the mentioned mechanisms open for future work .",
    "i add that in a given realisation the energy dependence might be different than assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "however , the generic assumption of a power law should be a reasonable approximation in many cases and capture the relevant phenomenology .",
    "i have considered short - baseline ( sbl ) neutrino oscillation data including lsnd and miniboone in the framework of sterile neutrino oscillations , assuming that the properties of the sterile neutrino depend on its energy in a rather exotic way . along these lines i considered two different scenarios .",
    "first , i have assumed that the mass of the sterile neutrino scales with its energy as @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this introduces a modified energy dependence ( med ) in oscillations : instead of the standard @xmath17 dependence one obtains a med with @xmath18 .",
    "second , i have assumed an energy dependent mixing ( edm ) of the sterile neutrino with the active ones , namely that the elements of the mixing matrix @xmath22 and @xmath83 scale with @xmath0 . in a given model realisation",
    "one can expect that both , masses as well as mixing depend on energy in a correlated way .",
    "here i have not specified any underlying theory , and a phenomenological analysis has been performed assuming the presence of either med or edm separately , to show the impact on the global fit of sbl data . for a given model",
    "it is easy to generalise the analysis and estimate the effect of the simultaneous scaling of masses and mixing .",
    "i find that under the hypothesis of med or edm oscillations lsnd and miniboone data become fully consistent , and the bound from disappearance data overlaps with the lsnd allowed region .",
    "the global fit including all relevant appearance and disappearance experiments improves by 12.7 ( med ) or 14.1 ( edm ) units in @xmath3 with respect to the standard ( 3 + 1 ) oscillation case , and the consistency of lsnd with no - evidence appearance experiments and with disappearance experiments improves from @xmath58 for standard oscillations to 3% ( med ) or 5% ( edm ) .",
    "if the tension between lsnd and karmen is removed from the analysis perfect consistency of all data is found , with probablities of 18% and 35% for med and edm , respectively , whereas the probablitiy of standard oscillations remains unacceptably low .",
    "consistency of the global data is obtained in the med framework by shifting the sensitivity of high energy experiments like miniboone and cdhs to larger values of @xmath6 with respect to low energy experiments like lsnd and bugey . in the case of edm oscillations",
    "the sensitivity of high energy experiments to the mixing angle gets weaker compared to low energy experiments , leading to consistency of all data .",
    "in summary , i have shown that under the assumption of a non - standard energy dependence of sterile neutrino oscillations the description of global sbl data is significantly improved .",
    "this result is based on the fact that various experiments operate at different energy regimes",
