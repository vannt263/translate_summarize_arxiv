    "the lyman-@xmath5  forest region in quasar ( qso ) spectra contains hundreds of hydrogen lyman-@xmath5  absorption lines ( see rauch 1998 for a review ) , most of which are produced by small density fluctuations in the intervening intergalactic medium ( cen _ et al .  _",
    "1994 ; bi & davidsen 1997 , hereafter bd97 ) . since these structures are still reasonably linear , they are good probes of the underlying large - scale matter distribution , and hence are sensitive to the cosmological model .",

    "the lyman-@xmath5  forest is promising in that it can be used over a larger redshift range than most other potential probes of @xmath1 .    here",
    "we use semi - analytical models of the lyman-@xmath5  forest , which have been shown to be successful in reproducing reasonably well most of its observed properties , such as the column density distribution function , the line - widths distribution and the number of lines per unit redshift ( bd97 ; viel _ et al .  _",

    "we plot @xmath21 , @xmath8 and the hubble parameter @xmath9 , for several values of @xmath1 , here assumed to be constant in time , for simplicity , using the fits of ma _ et al .  _",
    "if we compare the transfer function of qcdm and @xmath3cdm at @xmath22 one can see that there are differences only on very large scales , @xmath23 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "the hubble parameter in qcdm models with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 differs by 6 , 14 and 25 per cent at redshifts @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 from those of the @xmath3cdm model ( panel b ) .",
    "for those values of @xmath1 , the growth factors @xmath8 ( panel c ) at @xmath30 are larger than for the @xmath3cdm model by 5 , 15 and 30 per cent respectively .",
    "the semi - analytical model we use to generate lyman-@xmath5  forest spectra is based on the approximations introduced by bi and collaborators ( bd97 ; see viel _ et al .  _",
    "( 2002a ) for more details ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that the low - column density ly@xmath5 forest is produced by smooth fluctuations in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which arise as a result of gravitational growth of perturbations ( e.g. schaye 2001 ) .",
    "briefly , we start by generating correlated gaussian random fields to represent the linear density and peculiar velocity dark matter fields along a sight - line , for a given linear matter power spectrum .",
    "the linear density perturbations in the igm @xmath31 are related to those in the underlying dark matter by a convolution , @xmath32 . for the smoothing kernel @xmath33 we use the gaussian filter @xmath34 ( gnedin _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) , which is a good approximation to model the effects of gas pressure in the linear regime .",
    "the smoothing scale @xmath35 is related to the jeans length in a way which depends on the thermal history of the igm ( gnedin & hui 1998 ; matarrese & mohayaee 2002 ) .    to account for the fact that the igm which produces most of the lyman-@xmath5  forest is actually mildly non - linear , we follow bd97 and adopt a simple lognormal model ( coles & jones 1991 ) for the igm local density .",
    "this is a strong assumption but we think that at these redshift and for the large scale properties investigated here the log - normal model can be a good approximation to the more accurate hydro - dynamical simulations .",
    "we assume the gas to be in photoionization equilibrium with an imposed uniform uv - background , which we scale so that the mock spectra have the same effective optical depth @xmath36 as observed ( see kim _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 and bernardi _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , for recent determinations of @xmath37 ) .",
    "we use the values of schaye _ et al .  _",
    "( 2000 ) for the normalization @xmath38 and slope @xmath39 of the temperature - density relation , @xmath40 , in the igm .",
    "finally , we artificially broaden the spectra to a resolution of fwhm = 6.6 km s@xmath16 to mimic high quality vlt / uves or keck / hires spectra , and add gaussian noise with signal to noise of 50 ( see e.g. theuns _ et al .  _",
    "2000 for more details ) .",
    "spectra generated with this procedure have been shown to produce flux probability and line - width distribution functions in reasonable agreement with observations ( bd97 ) .",
    "we will compare the lyman-@xmath5  forest in a @xmath3cdm cosmological model with three different qcdm models , with @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "for all of these models , we assume that the cosmological parameters are @xmath42 .",
    "we simulate 10 different randomly generated spectra , with the same set of random phases for each spectrum , in the redshift range @xmath43 for each model , assuming @xmath44 ( kim _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 k. the filtering scale is @xmath47 ( with @xmath48 the jeans wave - number ) , which is a reasonable estimate if hi reionization takes place at @xmath49 ( gnedin & hui 1998 )",
    ". the spectra are approximately @xmath50 km s@xmath16 long .",
    "in addition , we simulate spectra of qso pairs with a given angular separation in the range 1090 arcsec , using the procedure described in viel _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "the cross - correlation coefficient spectra of pairs is estimated using the definition of viel _ et al .  _",
    "( 2002a ) from a set of 8 pairs for each separation . in panel d ) of figure 1 we show , for a qualitative comparison , a chunk of two simulated spectra for the @xmath3cdm and qcdm , with @xmath51 , model .",
    "we have decided to focus our analysis around @xmath30 in view of a comparison with observations which will be made in a future work .",
    "in this section we will study the effects of dark energy on the simulated spectra .",
    "the differences between the qcdm and @xmath3cdm model , which could be tested through lyman-@xmath5  absorptions , are the following : the linear dark matter power spectrum @xmath52 ; the evolution of the cosmological parameters and in particular of the hubble parameter @xmath9 ; the growth factors @xmath8 of the linear density perturbations .",
    "the simulated lyman-@xmath5  flux power spectrum agrees reasonably well with the linear dark matter power spectrum at large scales , while on smaller scales non - linear effects , thermal broadening and noise can produce differences .",
    "this is roughly true even if we do not correct for redshift - space distortions and compare directly the flux power spectrum of simulated absorption spectra and the linear dark matter power spectrum . from figure [ p1 ] ( panel a )",
    "we can see that the qcdm transfer function differs from the @xmath3cdm one only on scales larger than 100 comoving mpc .",
    "such scales are comparable to the extent of the lyman-@xmath5  forest region in a qso spectrum , and hence this signature of @xmath53 would be difficult to detect since it would require a large number of spectra to estimate the power on these scales .",
    "more importantly , in high resolution spectra every attempt to recover the power spectrum on scales larger than 10 comoving mpc is challenging due to the continuum fitting uncertainties ( croft _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "a second difference between qcdm and @xmath3cdm is the different evolution of the cosmological parameters , such as @xmath9 .",
    "we have explored the effect of a different hubble parameter and different growth factors values at redshift @xmath22 on the simulated lyman-@xmath5  optical depth , by fixing the remaining parameters .",
    "the effect is clear : a larger hubble parameter produces in general a broader optical depth distribution with the peak shifted to lower values .",
    "in fact , with a higher value of the hubble parameter , the same real - space absorber intersected by the sight - line will affect a larger region of the redshift - space spectrum .    in the same way",
    ", we explore the effect of different growth factors .",
    "if the growth factor is increased , the ( non - linear ) log - normal mapping acts in such a way that typically the low - density regions become less dense and the high - density regions more dense .",
    "thus , with a larger growth factor , as the one predicted for qcdm models compared to @xmath3cdm ones ( figure [ p1 ] , panel c ) , the simulated optical depth shifts to smaller values and its probability distribution function ( pdf ) becomes broader .",
    "this effect can be seen also in the simulated flux in panel d ) of figure [ p1 ] , for example at @xmath54 km s@xmath16 this is particularly evident .",
    "our first conclusion is that a larger growth factor produces the same effect of a higher value of the hubble parameter : a shift of the simulated lyman-@xmath5  optical depth to smaller values and a broader distribution , if the other parameters remain fixed .    to see these effects combined together , we plot in panel a ) of figure [ fig2 ] the probability distribution function of the simulated optical depth for @xmath3cdm ( dot - dashed line ) , qcdm with @xmath51 ( continuous line ) , @xmath55 ( dotted line ) and @xmath24 ( dashed line ) .",
    "we choose to plot the probability distribution function also for @xmath56 values smaller than those which can actually be recovered by standard techniques to better appreciate the differences between cosmological models .",
    "we can see that the simulated optical depth pdf results in different distributions for the four cosmological models . since the flux is the observed quantity , the inferred optical depth can be trusted only in the range @xmath57 ( corresponding to fluxes in the range 0.04 - 0.97 ) . with a more sophisticated analysis , based on pixel optical depth techniques",
    ", this range can be considerably extended ( aguirre _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 and references therein ) . in panel b ) of figure [ fig2 ] we plot the optical depth power spectrum for the qcdm and the @xmath3cdm model , with poissonian error bars .",
    "we can see that on scales @xmath58 the four cosmological models are distinguishable : while the shape is very similar , the normalization is different even if we choose the same value for @xmath59 .",
    "this is the effect of different amounts of non linearity in the four cosmological models , which influences the normalization of the curves .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we plot two more observational quantities : the number of underdense regions per unit redshift ( panel a ) and the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath60 estimated from the spectra of qso pairs at different separations ( panel b ) .",
    "the definition of underdense region adopted here is the following : if we are searching for an underdense region of size @xmath61 , we preliminarily smooth the simulated spectra on this scale ( top - hat smoothing ) and then we define as an underdensity a region for which the flux is larger than the mean flux at that redshift , estimated through @xmath59 .",
    "one can see that the predicted number of underdense regions per unit redshift is different for the four cosmological models . the number of underdense regions of intermediate sizes , between 700 km s@xmath16 and 2700 km s@xmath16 , which correspond to sizes in the range 10 - 40 comoving mpc in a @xmath3cdm universe , is larger in the @xmath3cdm model than in the qcdm ones .",
    "this is due to the combined effects of a different hubble parameters and a different growth factor for density perturbations , as we saw in panel a ) of figure [ fig2 ] , which produce more rarefied underdense region and denser high density regions in qcdm models than in @xmath3cdm models . in particular",
    ", we have found that the number of underdense regions of size 2500 km s@xmath16 for @xmath3cdm can be a factor of 2 and 1.5 larger than in qcdm model with @xmath51 and @xmath24 at @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath60 is plotted in panel b ) of figure [ fig3 ] , this number quantifies the amount of ` coherence ' in the transverse direction between spectra of qso pairs .",
    "the information contained in the transverse direction could be powerful and has already been analysed in the past ( miralda - escud _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; viel _ et al .",
    "_ 2002a ) .",
    "this test is in a sense similar to the more sophisticated alcock - paczinski test ( hui _ et al .  _",
    "1999 ; mcdonald & miralda - escud 1999 ; mcdonald 2001 ) and aims at discriminating between different cosmological models . here",
    ", we have simulated 8 qso pairs at @xmath62 for five separations ( 10 , 30 , 50 , 70 and 90 arcsec ) and computed the mean value and the error of the mean for this coefficient at each separation .",
    "the four models are very similar and the error bars overlap . only at angular scales",
    "there are some differences between the models .",
    "however , the number of pairs considered here is marginally sufficient to discriminate between a @xmath3cdm model and a qcdm with @xmath51 .",
    "we have estimated that 25 pairs with these small separations are needed to distinguish between the @xmath3cdm model and a qcdm with @xmath55 at a 3@xmath64 level .",
    "dark energy in the form of quintessence in the lyman-@xmath5  forest seems to be not easily distinguishable from a cosmological constant . even if the thermal state of the igm is completely known , the uncertainties on the values of the baryon fraction ( burles _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) and especially on the ionization parameter ( scott _ et al .  _ 2000 ) , are so large that it would be difficult to recover the evolution of @xmath9 . we have found that a qcdm model with @xmath51 requires an ionization parameter a factor of 3 lower than in a @xmath3cdm model ( while for @xmath24 it is a factor of 1.25 lower ) , in order to match observed @xmath59 .",
    "uncertainties on the value of @xmath59 are of the order of 40% , but in the near future , with larger data set available , this uncertainty will become significantly smaller . in principle , an accurate determination of @xmath59 , with a precision of @xmath65 could already be used to discriminate between qcdm with @xmath51 and @xmath3cdm models , since the present uncertainties on the ionization parameter are of the order of 50% .",
    "statistics based on the optical depth like the pdf or the power spectrum , instead of the flux , can be much more useful in discriminating between different cosmological models .",
    "this is due to the fact that the optical depth is very sensitive to the amount of non - linearity introduced in the different cosmological models .",
    "however , in order to do that , it will be necessary to use pixel optical depth techniques , using higher order lyman lines , to get reliable estimates of the optical depths both in saturated and in high transmissivity regions .",
    "_ in summary _",
    ", we have presented a preliminary analysis of simulated spectra in qcdm models and in a @xmath3cdm model based on semi - analytical models .",
    "the main differences can be found in the different evolution of @xmath9 and of the linear growth factor of density perturbations @xmath8 .",
    "both these effects act in a similar way . if we fix the remaining parameters and compare the probability distribution function of lyman-@xmath5  optical depth between qcdm and @xmath3cdm we have found that the distribution in the qcdm model is broader than in the @xmath3cdm case .",
    "this means that in general high transmission regions are more rarefied and high density regions are denser in qcdm than in a @xmath3cdm universe .",
    "the optical depth power spectrum is different on intermediate and large scales , even if the normalization @xmath59 is the same , because of the different amounts of non linearity predicted for the models .",
    "detecting the underdense regions could be promising .",
    "in fact , we have found that the number of intermediate size underdense regions , with sizes of the order of 10 comoving mpc , is larger in a @xmath3cdm model than in qcdm ones .",
    "another statistics we have proposed concerns the the cross - correlation coefficient between the spectra of qso pairs . however , in this case , the differences can be appreciated only for separations smaller than 20 arcsec and the number of pairs should be larger than 20 to distinguish between qcdm and @xmath3cdm cosmological models at a 3@xmath64 level .",
