    "the origin of gravity is still a puzzle in spite of the success of general relativity ( gr ) in considering a curved space - time due to the presence of a mass and its well - known relevant implications .",
    "such puzzle arises from the quantum aspect of gravitation , which occurs in the so - called planck length scale @xmath5 m related to planck energy scale @xmath6gev with planck temperature @xmath7k , which represents a quantum singularity where the gravitational field equation of gr ( einstein s equation ) fails .",
    "so , in the early universe with temperature @xmath7k , vacuum fluctuations prevailed in a scenario of quantum - gravity , which is not still well - understood .",
    "currently , the most widely accepted explanation for their origin is in the context of cosmic inflation .",
    "the statistical properties of the primordial fluctuations can be inferred from observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and from measurements of the distribution of matter . since the fluctuations are believed to arise from inflation , such measurements can also set constraints on parameters within inflationary theory .",
    "another puzzle that should be deeper explored is the thermodynamical aspect of gravitation .",
    "recent investigations have shown that gravitational field equations in a wide class of models can be interpreted with a thermodynamical origin .",
    "this idea , originally due to sakharov@xcite , has different forms of implementation @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and also other approaches @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "in the early universe with planck temperature @xmath8 , space - time was confined to planck area @xmath1 .",
    "so imagine such an extremely small area @xmath1 , which earlier has expanded dramatically ( inflationary model ) and then continued to expand more softly to reach the current area @xmath2",
    ", @xmath9 m ) being the hubble radius .",
    "thus , in this holographic model , the expanding universe 3-d works like the surface 2-d of a spherical `` balloon '' with area @xmath10 for a given age and temperature . in other words , we say that such holographic model is considering a spherical surface 2-d for representing the own `` tissue '' of space - time 4-d that expands , since a quantum space 2-d given in the planck scale ( @xmath11 ) leads to a continuum space 3-d seen in the macro - scale , according to this holographic model .",
    "according to this model , let us admit the universe as being a gas of @xmath12 particles in thermal equilibrium with the `` particles '' on the surface of the cavity of the black - body ( spherical surface ) that plays the role of a background frame for representing the `` tissue '' of space - time . furthermore , since the `` cavity 2-d of the black - body '' is the own space - time ( universe ) , we should consider that each particle of the gas represents a proof particle that mimics and has a correspondent virtual `` particle '' inside a very small area of the dark cavity , that is the planck area ( @xmath1 ) . in doing this",
    ", we conclude that the spherical surface , that is the universe in this holographic model , can be divided in @xmath12 areas of planck @xmath13 , so that we write                    here we must stress that such `` gas '' is not a true gas where its particles can move randomly over a @xmath20-dimensional surface ( spherical surface ) . actually , it is a imitation of a gas considered for only one degree of freedom ( radial direction @xmath17 ) , so that each `` particle '' of this `` gas '' is connected to a quantum of space - time given by the planck area @xmath13 , which is radially expanding ( fig.1 ) .     of minimal areas ( planck areas ) , each one of them being connected to a dark infinitesimal energy working like a `` particle '' of an exotic `` gas '' ,",
    "whose total mass is @xmath21 . a baryonic proof particle of a certain gas in thermal equilibrium with the sphere with temperature @xmath0 , being placed over its surface experiences an acceleration according to the unruh effect .",
    "such acceleration has anti - gravitational origin , which is related to the cosmological constant . ]",
    "now let us consider a proof particle ( e.g : a particle of a true gas ) over the spherical surface with temperature @xmath0 [ eq.(4 ) ] , such that this particle is in thermal equilibrium with the sphere .",
    "then , in this case , as this particle has a radial acceleration ( @xmath22 ) , the unruh effect@xcite states that such a particle experiences a thermal bath with the same temperature @xmath0 of the sphere [ eq.(4 ) ] , namely :                eq.(7 ) is the own law of universal gravitation and it is interesting to call attention to the fact that such law was obtained in a cosmological scenario , where different concepts like black - body , background radiation ( unruh effect ) and an expanding exotic `` gas '' with mass @xmath26 for representing the space - time quantized in planck areas are put in together , all of them being essentially connected by a quantum gravity ( planck scale ) , at least in the context given by eq.(1 ) .",
    "although eq.(7 ) is the law of universal gravitation , which can be applied for any spherical body with mass @xmath26 that generates a gravitational force of attraction over a proof particle , eq.(7 ) was obtained in a scenario of quantum - gravity [ eq.(1 ) ] connected to a vacuum energy , i.e. , a dark mass @xmath26 of a virtual `` gas '' that fills the whole space - time . in this sense , since such `` gas '' is expansive , leading to the expansion of the spherical surface ( fig.1 ) , we realize that the acceleration obtained in eq.(7 ) is an anti - gravitational acceleration , which occurs only in the cosmological scenario where we consider the whole universe , so that the mass @xmath26 in eq.(7 ) is a kind of dark mass that fills the whole universe represented by the spherical surface of radius @xmath17 for a given age of the expanding universe .    in short",
    ", we can say that eq.(7 ) is the newton s gravitation law applied to the expanding universe as a whole ( a spherical dark mass @xmath21 with a certain radius @xmath17 ) ; however eq.(7 ) works like an anti - gravitational law .",
    "thus , we should rewrite eq.(7 ) , as follows :      where the sign `` @xmath28 '' simply indicates that the acceleration is repulsive , @xmath29 being the acceleration of expansion , @xmath17 is the radius of the sphere ( universe ) and @xmath21 is the dark mass related to the dark energy @xmath30 , which is about @xmath31 per cent of the whole universe .",
    "so , a proof particle ( luminous matter like a gas of cosmic dust , a star or a galaxy ) on the surface of such dark sphere ( frontier of the expanding universe ) experiences a repulsive acceleration that will be estimated by eq.(8 ) , from where we will also derive the cosmological constant .    according to recent studies@xcite ,",
    "the density of matter in the universe is about @xmath32 , which means that it is @xmath33 billion billion billion times less dense than water .",
    "note that this includes the contribution of dark matter ( non - baryonic matter ) plus the density of luminous matter or baryonic matter ( that we see as stars and galaxies ) , which is about @xmath34 per cent of the whole universe , about @xmath35 per cent being dark matter and @xmath36 per cent being luminous matter .",
    "now , the size of the observable universe is about 14 billion light years , and using the above value of density related to luminous and dark matter ( @xmath34 per cent of the whole universe ) , we find a mass of about @xmath37 g ; however , since dark energy is the majority of the universe ( @xmath31 per cent ) , we estimate @xmath21 ( related to dark energy ) about @xmath38 g , which leads us to conclude that the entire energy ( mass ) content can be roughly estimated as being the own dark energy @xmath21 of the order of @xmath39 g .",
    "then , by making @xmath40 kg , @xmath41 m and @xmath42 in eq.(8 ) , we obtain the following acceleration of anti - gravity for a proof particle , namely @xmath43 , which is an expected result because the acceleration of expansion of the universe is too small .    we know that the cosmological `` constant '' @xmath44 is related to the acceleration of expansion of the universe .",
    "actually @xmath44 is the acceleration rate per unit of distance @xmath17 ( @xmath45 in si units ) , so that we have @xmath46 . in doing this , from eq.(8 ) , we find            as we have @xmath42 , @xmath40 kg and @xmath48 m , thus , from eq.(10 ) , we finally obtain @xmath50 , which is just the order of magnitude of the cosmological constant in agreement with the observational results@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite    we would like to call attention to the fact that the very high values obtained for the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density by means of quantum field theory ( qft ) for describing the quantum vacuum have a discrepancy of about 120 orders of magnitude beyond their observational values . this puzzle is well - known as the _  cosmological constant problem\"_@xcite@xcite    99 a. d. sakharov , sov .",
