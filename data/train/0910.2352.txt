    "advances in nanofabrication technology resulted recently in high - quality metallic superconducting ultrathin nanofilms  @xcite and nanowires .",
    "@xcite in most samples the electron mean free path was estimated to be about or larger than the nanofilm / nanowire thickness .",
    "@xcite in this case the effects of the transverse quantization are not shadowed by impurity scattering and , hence , the conduction band splits up into a series of single - electron subbands resulting from the quantized transverse modes .",
    "this will have a pronounced effect on the superconducting properties ( see , for instance , refs .   and and references therein ) .",
    "notice that high - quality nanofilms do not exhibit significant indications of defect- or phase - driven suppression of superconductivity ( see discussion in ref .  ) . for high - quality nanowires",
    "the phase - fluctuation effects were shown to seriously influence the superconducting state only in narrowest aluminum specimens with width @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite thus , the transverse quantum confinement is the major mechanism governing the superconducting properties in this case .",
    "therefore , it is timely to study in a more detail a clean nanoscale superconductor in the presence of quantum confinement .",
    "quantum confinement breaks the translational symmetry and , so , the superconducting order parameter becomes position dependent .",
    "the well - known bcs ansatz for the ground state wave function is not applicable in this case , and the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations are a relevant tool to investigate equilibrium superconducting properties .",
    "recent numerical studies of the bdg equations for nanofilms  @xcite and nanowires  @xcite show that the transverse quantum confinement has a substantial impact on the superconducting solution .",
    "however , the bdg equations investigated in refs .  , , and , were solved without the hartree - fock ( hf ) potential .",
    "the reason is that in bulk , the superconducting solution is not sensitive to the hf term in the bdg equations  @xcite , and one can assume that a similar conclusion holds for the broken translational symmetry .",
    "however , at present there is no detailed investigations on this subject and , so , such a study is needed .    in the bulk bdg equations , the hf potential is not spatially dependent and , so , it produces the same contribution to all single - electron energies , with no dependence on the relevant quantum numbers .",
    "hence , the fermi level ( the chemical potential ) acquires the same contribution , as well , and the single - electron energies measured from the fermi level are not changed .",
    "it is well - known that the bdg equations are derived within the grand canonical formalism and , so , the electron energies appearing in the basic expressions absorb the chemical potential . as a result , the superconducting solution is insensitive to the hf potential .",
    "the situation is different in the presence of quantum confinement .",
    "the translational symmetry is now broken , the hf mean field is position dependent , and , so , its contribution to the single - electron energies is a function of the relevant quantum numbers .",
    "furthermore , the single - electron wave functions themselves are influenced by the presence of the hf field , i.e. , an additional spatially - dependent potential .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the hf term in the bdg equations can change the superconducting solution in the presence of quantum confinement .",
    "it is of importance to clarify to what extent this will be through . in particular , this concerns the thickness - dependent oscillations ( i.e. , quantum - size oscillations ) of the superconducting properties typical of high - quality nanofilms and nanowires .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work , based on the particular case of a superconducting clean metallic nanowire of the cylindrical form ,",
    "we compare the superconducting numerical solutions of the bdg equations with and without the hf potential .",
    "we find that these solutions are indeed different and , for some nanocylinder diameters , this can be very significant .",
    "however , a more close look reveals that this difference is actually expressed in a small shift of the curve representing thickness - dependent oscillations of the critical temperature ( or other important superconducting quantities ) up to larger diameters .",
    "the shift is less than typical metallic unit - cell dimensions and , so , can be ignored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the formalism of the bdg equations is outlined , with the focuser on the features related to the cylindrical confining geometry .",
    "in addition , the anderson approximate solution to the bdg equations is discussed in this section . to check the effect of the hf term on the single - electron wave functions ,",
    "the anderson solution is constructed by assuming that these wave functions do not change in the presence of the hf interaction . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] numerical results of the bdg equations with and without the hf term are discussed .",
    "based on the anderson solution , here we also investigate the effect of the hf term on the single - electron wave functions .",
    "we focus on the basic superconducting properties of a metallic clean cylindrical nanowire ( with diameter @xmath1 and length @xmath2 ) in the quantum - size regime when the transverse quantization of the single - electron spectrum is of importance . in the presence of quantum confinement",
    "the translational invariance is broken , and the order parameter appears to be position - dependent , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "it is well - known that the bdg equations are a common and useful approach to investigate such a situation .",

    "the bulk bcs coherence length @xmath77 is significantly larger than the nanocylinder diameter .",

    "[ fig1](b ) the corresponding critical temperature @xmath83  ( in units of the bulk one ) is given .",
    "as seen , both data - sets exhibit pronounced size - dependent oscillations , typical of high - quality superconducting nanofilms and nanowires with uniform thickness  @xcite . such oscillations result from single - electron subbands forming due to the transverse quantization of the electron motion . with an increase in the nanowire diameter , the subbands shift down in energy .",
    "each time when a new subband comes into the debye window around the fermi level , the number of single - electron states contributing to the superconducting order parameter increases , and a size - dependent superconducting resonance develops . as follows from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the quantum - size oscillations corresponding to the full version of the bdg equations are somewhat shifted up . hence , the difference between the two sets of data is most significant for those diameters , where a size - dependent superconducting resonance in the case without the hf interaction is already present while in the full version such a resonance only starts to develop .",
    "the difference is not so significant but still survive when the resonance comes into its decay stage .",
    "when the resonance is fully decayed ( the off - resonant regime ) , the hf corrections are practically negligible , and we arrive at the situation similar to bulk .",
    "notice that small differences between the numerical results of the full and truncated bdg equations in the off - resonant regime ( due to beating patterns of the corresponding curves ) , are because of the chosen nanowire length .",
    "indeed , as follows from calculations for several selected off - resonant diameters , such beating patterns disappear when @xmath2 increases up to @xmath84 , and the results with and without the hf interaction approach each other .",

    "[ fig1](b ) are generally higher than those of @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "this is due to formation of new andreev - type states induced by the transverse quantum confinement ( see details in ref .  ) , which results in a decrease of @xmath87 below the bulk value @xmath88 at the resonant points . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , inclusion of the hf interaction can slightly reduce the resonant enhancements , with practically no effect on the ratio @xmath89 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present different quantities calculated with the full and truncated versions of eqs .",
    "( [ bdga ] ) and ( [ bdgb ] ) for two diameters : the upper panel , for @xmath90 ; and the lower panel , for @xmath91 .",
    "the upper panel represents the situation when a superconducting resonance is developed for the truncated version but is not yet present for the full version of the bdg equations . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) the superconducting order parameter @xmath38 calculated with ( hf ) and without the hf interaction  ( no hf , the inset ) , is plotted versus the transverse coordinate @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the pair condensate is very different for these two cases : the data without the hf interaction are larger by an order of magnitude , and even the profile of @xmath38 is different . in fig .",
    "( [ fig2])(b ) the local electron density , i.e. , @xmath94 , \\label{neloc}\\ ] ] is shown for the same diameter .",
    "as can be expected , now the difference between the two data - sets is not so significant  ( we keep to the same value of the mean electron density @xmath32 ) . due to the attractive character of the effective electron - electron interaction , the hf potential forces electrons to go closer to the nanocylinder center",
    "however , the confining interaction has the major effect on @xmath95 as compared to the hf potential producing only some small corrections . from the results for the local electron density",
    ", it is possible to expect that the single - electron wave functions are also not very sensitive to the hf interaction . for nanowires , @xmath96 and @xmath97 is nearly proportional to the corresponding single - electron wave function  [ see discussion above , after eq .",
    "( [ and ] ) ] . hence , due to eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , the quantity @xmath98 can provide us with the information about the single - electron distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) @xmath98 is plotted versus @xmath92 for the quantum numbers most sensitive to including the hf interaction .",
    "we can indeed see that the effect of the hf potential on the wave functions is minor .",
    "similar conclusions can be obtained from the lower panel of fig .",
    "the only exception is that the superconducting order parameter in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d )  [ @xmath99 does not change so much when including the hf potential . notice that @xmath95 given in fig .",
    "[ fig2](e ) is practically the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . however , this is not true for @xmath100  [ compare panel ( c ) with panel ( f ) ] .",
    "the point is that the integral @xmath101 changes with the radius but for the single - electron distribution @xmath98 we have eq .  ( [ norm ] ) ] .    from the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one expects minor effects on the single - electron wave functions due to the incorporation of the hf interaction .",
    "this expectation can be put on a more solid ground by using the anderson approximation based on eqs .",
    "( [ gapander ] ) and ( [ hfander ] ) .",
    "we remind that the anderson approximation is quite good for superconducting nanowires provided that it involves the true single - electron wave functions .",
    "equations  ( [ gapander ] ) and ( [ hfander ] ) follow from eq .  ( [ and ] ) and , hence , as assumed , the single - electron wave functions are not altered by our position - dependent hf interaction .",
    "if this is a reasonable assumption , results of the anderson approximation constructed in this way , should be close to the results of the full bdg equations . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , this is indeed the case .",
    "we can conclude that the thickness - dependent shift of the superconducting resonances in the presence of the hf interaction has nothing to do with the single - electron wave functions .",
    "its mechanism is due to the fact that the position - dependent hf potential results in a change of the single - electron energies measured from the fermi level .",
    "so far we considered extremely narrow nanowires , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "however , a similar shift ( @xmath102 ) of the quantum - size oscillations due to the hf term survives until the total decay of the quantum - size oscillations ( up to diameters of about @xmath103 ) . in particular , such a shift is clearly seen in fig .  [ fig4 ] , where numerical results of the truncated bdg equations for @xmath104 are compared with a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ gapander ] ) and([hfander ] ) including the hf potential .",
    "thus , we arrive at the following picture . in the vicinity of a superconducting resonance , the bottom of some single - electron subband",
    "is situated close to the fermi level .",
    "therefore , a repositioning of this subband with respect to the fermi level can result in a significant change of the number of single - electron states in the debye window and , so , in a remarkable increase / decrease of superconducting characteristics .",
    "however , when bottoms of all single - electron subbands are quite apart from the fermi level , i.e. , in the off - resonant regime , a move of these subbands in energy produces much less important effect on the number of single - electron states located in the debye window .",
    "this is why the decay of a superconducting resonance is accompanied by a depletion of the influence of the hf potential .",
    "quantum confinement breaks the translational symmetry in nanostructured superconductors . in this case , despite the delta - function approximation for the electron - electron interaction , the hf potential becomes position dependent , and its contribution to the single - electron energy ( measured from the fermi level ) is a function of the relevant quantum numbers ( contrary to bulk ! ) . by numerically solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for a clean metallic nanocylinder , we have shown that such a feature results in a shift of the curve representing the thickness - dependent oscillations of the critical temperature ( the energy gap , the order parameter etc . ) to larger diameters .",
    "though difference between the numerical results with and without the hf potential can be rather significant for some given diameters , the above mentioned shift is less than typical metallic unit - cell dimensions and , so , can be ignored . in particular ,",
    "smoothing due to the thickness fluctuations in real samples will shadow this effect .",
    "thus , when solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations in the nano - regime , one is able to neglect the hf term , which significantly simplifies a numerical procedure .",
