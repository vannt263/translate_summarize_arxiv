    "we employ the dil model  @xcite parameters summarized in  , as well as vacuum saturation for the dimension-8 gluon condensate  @xcite @xmath147 and instanton estimates of the dimension - six condensate @xcite @xmath148 finally , again using the approximation @xmath149 and the central gluon condensate value [ see ] from reference @xcite , we find that the role of instanton contributions to the sum - rules ( [ lm1][l1 ] ) is as illustrated in figures [ sm1_fig ] , [ s0_fig ] , and [ s1_fig ] . in particular , we see that the instanton contributions diminish @xmath150 .",
    "the let term @xmath7 , which leads to the asymptotic flattening of @xmath150 at a value substantially different from zero when instantons are absent , is clearly suppressed by instanton effects in the large @xmath43 region .",
    "as noted earlier , such flattening over the @xmath151 region would be indicative via ( [ lap_m1_res ] ) of a sub - gev lowest - lying resonance ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath152 over the physically relevant region of @xmath43 ) instanton effects no only undo this flattening , but also increase @xmath153 and alter the shape of @xmath154 .",
    "the corresponding effects of instantons on the sum - rule ratios ( [ l1_bounds][l0_bounds ] ) is shown in figures [ s0sm1_fig ] and [ s1s0_fig ] . as expected from the instanton s impact of lowering @xmath155 and elevating @xmath156 , the ratio @xmath157 $ ]",
    "is increased substantially by inclusion of instanton effects , increasing the corresponding upper bound on the mass of the lightest gluonium state .",
    "instanton effects also serve to _ lower _ the ratio @xmath158 , decreasing the corresponding upper bound on the mass of the lightest gluonium state .",
    "figures [ ratios_on_fig ] and [ ratios_off_fig ] summarize the ratio ( mass bound ) analysis in the presence and in the absence of instanton effects .",
    "it is evident that instanton effects lead to a substantial increase in the mass bound on the lightest gluonium state , but other important features emerge .",
    "for example , the instanton suppression of the let term @xmath7 reduces the discrepancy between the ratios including or omitting the @xmath25 sum - rule .",
    "furthermore , a @xmath43-minimum stability plateau crucial for establishing a credible upper mass bound is seen to occur at reasonable energy scales ( @xmath159 ) only when instanton effects are included .",
    "the ratios with instanton effects included ( see figure [ ratios_on_fig ] ) are remarkably flat , suggesting that the mass bounds could be close to the mass prediction that would be obtained from a full sum - rule analysis incorporating the qcd continuum ( _ i.e. _ @xmath160 ) in the phenomenological model .",
    "we have calculated the instanton contribution to the laplace sum - rules of scalar gluonium and demonstrated explicitly how , for the lowest order @xmath25 sum - rule , this instanton contribution cancels part of the dominant let constant .    as noted in the introduction , a discrepancy between the lowest lying states evident from the lowest and from the next - to - lowest laplace sum - rules may be indicative of two distinct states .",
    "such is found to be the case , for example , in the pseudoscalar channel in which the pion dominates the leading ( @xmath161 ) laplace sum rule , but the @xmath47 resonance is found to dominate the next - to - leading ( @xmath162 ) laplace sum rule , because of a mass - suppression of the lowest - lying ( pion ) state in the latter sum rule @xcite .",
    "moreover , analyses of the scalar gluonium channel in the absence of explicit instanton contributions seem to exhibit a similar discrepancy between leading @xmath25 and non - leading @xmath44 sum - rules @xcite .",
    "prior qcd sum - rule analyses of the instanton contribution to the scalar gluonium channel have focused either on the @xmath118 sum rule exclusively @xcite or the let - insensitive @xmath44 sum - rules @xcite .",
    "although these two analyses ( which are separated by almost two decades ) are both indicative of a lowest lying - resonance mass near or above @xmath163 , their input content ( parameter values and levels of perturbation theory ) are necessarily different , suggesting the need for a single consistent treatment of leading @xmath25 and non - leading @xmath44 laplace sum - rules in the scalar gluonium channel that is inclusive of instanton effects .",
    "we have shown here that careful consideration of the contribution arising from instantons within the @xmath118 sum rule in this channel leads to consistency with higher sum - rules in the estimation of lowest - lying resonance masses in the scalar gluonium channel .",
    "correspondence with the prior treatment of the @xmath118 sum rule @xcite can be obtained by examining the instanton contribution to this sum rule in the high - energy limit of small @xmath43 .",
    "this contribution is obtained through evaluation of the integral in in the large-@xmath164 [ @xmath165 limit : @xmath166k_0\\left(\\frac{\\rho^2}{2\\tau}\\right)+ \\frac{\\rho^2}{2\\tau}\\left[2+\\frac{\\rho^2}{\\tau}+\\frac{\\rho^4}{4\\tau^2}\\right ] k_1\\left(\\frac{\\rho^2}{2\\tau}\\right)\\right ] e^{-\\frac{\\rho^2}{2\\tau } } \\label{full_inst}\\\\ & \\rightarrow & -16\\pi^{\\frac{5}{2}}\\int dn(\\rho )   e^{-\\frac{\\rho^2}{\\tau}}\\rho^5\\tau^{-\\frac{5}{2 } } \\left[1+{\\cal o}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\rho^2}\\right)\\right]~,~\\tau\\ll\\rho^2~. \\label{shuryak_limit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the instanton liquid model [ @xmath167 , is consistent with eq .",
    "( 42 ) of reference @xcite for the instanton contribution to the @xmath118 sum - rule , which was utilized to anticipate the @xmath168 lattice prediction of the scalar gluonium mass .",
    "figure [ shuryak_compare_fig ] provides a comparison of this asymptotic form with the exact expression for @xmath169 under the instanton - liquid assumption .",
    "of particular interest is the difference between the two expressions over the range @xmath170 , corresponding to the @xmath171 range in figure [ ratios_on_fig ] for which @xmath172}$ ] is flat .",
    "although both the asymptotic expression of @xcite and the exact expression provide negative contributions which mitigate dominance of the positive let contribution over @xmath0 , the exact expression is substantially larger in magnitude over the region of phenomenological interest .",
    "we speculate that such an increase relative to the analysis of @xcite serves to compensate for the larger phenomenological value at present for the gluon condensate within the low - energy theorem term , although it may also compensate the non - leading perturbative contributions in not known at the time of @xcite .    of course",
    ", more sophisticated expressions for the instanton contributions have been utilized to generate consistent scalar gluonium phenomenology both within @xcite and complementary to @xcite a qcd sum rule framework , as noted above .",
    "the key point of the work presented here is the reconciliation of the @xmath118 sum rule with higher-@xmath19 sum - rules .",
    "we reiterate the approximate consistency between scalar - gluonium masses obtained from the flattened regions of the @xmath172}$ ] and @xmath173 curves of figure [ ratios_on_fig ] , as well as the drastic reduction of the scalar gluonium mass evident in the curves of figure [ ratios_off_fig ] when instanton contributions are omitted . roughly speaking",
