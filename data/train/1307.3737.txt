    "lead magnesium niobate pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pmn ) is a canonical relaxor material characterized by an extremely large magnitude of dielectric permittivity over a broad temperature range and having logarithmically - wide frequency dispersion @xcite that is strongly demanded in many valuable applications .",
    "for example , this is important to produce small - size capacitors robust to the temperature change .",
    "dilution of pmn with ferroelectrics led to the discovery of one of the best piezoelectrics ever found , which have now extremely wide applications , in all brunches of life , science and technology @xcite . at the same time , the understanding of the main property of relaxors , which is the colossal dielectric response , is still debated @xcite .",
    "the source for the main properties of relaxors is usually related to the temperature growth of the polar nano regions ( pnr s ) on cooling @xcite .",
    "it is believed that pnr s start their development , at a temperature called the burns temperature of @xmath3 , and increase their strength on cooling @xcite .",
    "chu , setter and tagantsev @xcite suggested that @xmath4 might manifest a local phase transformation and heterophase fluctuations . according to ref .",
    "[ ] , this phase is characterized by a critical change of the lower boundary of the pb off - centering magnitude .",
    "specifically , this lower boundary , above @xmath4 , is zero , but critically increases on cooling below @xmath4 .",
    "we will call the phase below this temperature as spherical glass , because the pb - off - centerings were shown to be spherical @xcite .",
    "the spherical model was recently confirmed also in ref .",
    "[ ] , and it is also in line with the suggestion that this phase corresponds to the heisenberg - like universality class , while at lower temperatures reduces to the ising universality class @xcite . in ref .",
    "[ ] the emergence of the relaxor properties at @xmath5 was related to the crossover between the lattice and relaxational dynamics , leading to a specific phonon confinement called also breathers .",
    "we assume that this phase freezes only the magnitude , but not the direction of the pb displacement .",
    "this assumption implies that the corresponding order parameter is scalar .",
    "the correlation of these scalar ( looking like a higgs boson @xcite ) off - centerings can happen via the lattice volume modulation , which is scalar too .",
    "it is interesting to notice also that some of such off - centerings can have intense rotational dynamics , and the transverse instability of such rotators might result in specific nontrivial relaxations @xcite and contributions to dielectric permittivity @xcite that , actually , has been observed as a non - landau contribution @xcite .",
    "vogel - fulcher freezing temperature @xmath6 is another famous temperature in relaxors @xcite .",
    "below this temperature , pmn reaches a glass - like state associated with critical slowing down of the local dipoles on cooling together with gradual broadening of the relaxation frequency spectrum @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "in contrast to the glass - like idea @xcite , @xmath6 can be alternatively considered as the temperature of the emergence of the polarization nanodomains , controlled by the quenched random electric fields @xcite arising from the @xmath7 and @xmath8 random distribution over the crystal lattice .",
    "a combined concept has been introduced by glinchuk , according to which the low temperature phase in pmn can be called as mixed ferroglass @xcite .",
    "this author defines two quantities , @xmath9 is the most probable magnitude of the long - range dipolar field and @xmath10 is the half width of the random field distribution function .",
    "when @xmath10 is much larger than @xmath9 , a glass order stabilizes .",
    "if @xmath10 is much smaller then ferroelectricity shows up . in between of these two limits ,",
    "the ferroglass is the stable phase , which is a mixture of the glass and ferroelectric phases .",
    "the formation of the ferroglass on cooling has been thoroughly studied directly by neutron diffraction @xcite and dielectric spectroscopy @xcite methods .",
    "knowing the observations at both @xmath4 and @xmath6 peculiar temperatures , several elegant theoretical models have been proposed .",
    "they include , for instance , the quenched - random - field - model @xcite , the random - site - electric - dipole - system theory @xcite or the most recent and accepted spherical - random - bond  random - field model @xcite .",
    "this latter model considers a new type of glass by introducing an analog of the edvards - anderson parameter in the theory of relaxors .",
    "it is worth also mentioning first - principles calculations of relaxors @xcite , which exploited the idea @xcite that the ferroelectric relaxors possess nanoscale chemically ordered regions facilitating the emergence of pnr s .",
    "in contrast to this idea , some other calculations have shown a possibility to calculate some relaxor properties without the use of the idea about the chemically ordered regions @xcite .",
    "the idea of the frustration of ferroelectricity has been also considered in the frame of recent first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the relaxor - like features related to @xmath4 and @xmath6 , viehland _ et al _ emphasized the fundamental importance of temperature @xmath11 , which could manifest a new phase having glass features @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the authors got this temperature by extrapolating the curie - weiss temperature , from the high - temperature part of dielectric permittivity .",
    "et al _ @xcite found a critical temperature @xmath12 , on the basis of the lattice parameter temperature behavior and x - ray and neutron integrated diffraction intensity . in qualitative agreement with these findings ,",
    "svitelskiy _ et al _ @xcite found that e - raman - lines split up , critically , at @xmath13 , on cooling , with the ratio of the components of @xmath14 .",
    "the authors explained this splitting by a ( local ) tetragonal distortion .",
    "recent measurements @xcite of the thermally stimulated acoustic emission revealed another temperature , @xmath15 , which is significantly higher than 400 k. at this temperature , the acoustic emission had a pulse , on cooling .",
    "these authors related this pulse to the formation of static pnr s .",
    "most recently , new measurements @xcite of diffuse neutron scattering , with a higher than earlier precision @xcite , revealed the former temperature , @xmath16 , again . according to the authors",
    ", this temperature marks the start of the diffuse neutron scattering , having a so - called butterfly shape , on cooling .",
    "less precise earlier measurements exhibited a strong tail in this integral intensity @xcite .",
    "the authors @xcite concluded that pnr s develop on cooling starting from @xmath16 rather than from @xmath4 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , all these facts have not got any reasonable explanation , in the frame of a microscopic model of relaxors , so far .",
    "actually , this transformation has not been taken into account in the previous theoretical models @xcite . in the present paper , we will focus on the significance of this issue .",
    "( notice that the notations @xmath17 and @xmath18 are ours .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "[ ] both used the notation @xmath19 as in ref .",
    ".    we will relate all these @xmath19 s , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 to different stages of the freezing of the random local tetragonal distortions , on cooling , and this is why we will call this phase as quadrupole glass ( see also studies of other quadrupole glasses in refs .",
    "this phase differs from the mixed ferroglass phase by the fact that the local dipoles are still dynamic , but being compared with the spherical glass , they are now strongly cooperative , not only in the magnitude but also in the direction .",
    "we will argue , in the manuscript , that the quadrupole glass phase transition is diffuse , and this makes the dielectric permittivity also diffuse .",
    "let us remind that this diffusness has been considered so far as one of the main features of the relaxors @xcite .",
    "now , we are going to give more details , derivations , and experiments , supporting this picture of pmn .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section 2 discusses the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter in pmn .",
    "section 3 suggests the idea of the quadrupole glass .",
    "section 4 reviews the diffuse scattering of neutrons in pmn .",
    "section 5 addresses the main point of the paper , the giant dielectric response in pmn .",
    "section 6 gives some scenarios of the possible local tetragonal distortion , in the temperature interval of interest .",
    "section 7 presents our data of the photoelectric current .",
    "finally , section 8 summarizes our results and discusses possible implications .",
    "in order to illustrate an experimental evidence of the quadrupole phase , first , we present the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter @xmath22 in pmn @xcite .",
    "these data manifest two different anomalies , at @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the anomaly at @xmath18 was denoted earlier also as @xmath20 @xcite ) . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the lattice parameter temperature dependence has the strongest curvature .",
    "contrary to this , at @xmath18 , the temperature change of the lattice parameter vanishes , at all .",
    "let us discuss , first , the change at @xmath23*. according to general thermodynamics @xcite , the largest curvature of @xmath24 results in the largest thermally stimulated strain .",
    "indeed , @xmath25\\delta t\\ ] ] @xmath26 is the temperature lowering , @xmath27 is the volume of the sample , and @xmath28 is the change of the strain on temperature cooling . the former term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) corresponds to the straight dependence of the volume on temperature .",
    "the latter one originates from the dependence of the heat capacity on pressure @xcite :    @xmath29    we believe @xcite that this last term in equation ( 1 ) is responsible for the strong thermally stimulated acoustic emission at @xmath30*. indeed , the largest curvature of the lattice parameter temperature change implies the largest second derivative of the volume with respect to temperature , and this results , according to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , in the largest strain , which can trigger the thermally stimulated acoustic emission ( via , for example , appearance of cracks ) .",
    "the significance of temperature t@xmath31 * deserves special attention . at this temperature , the thermal change of the lattice parameter disappears and , correspondingly , the lattice anharmonicity vanishes .",
    "this kind of transformation has been found also in other relaxors @xcite .",
    "for the sake of illustration , we want to make some bridge between this phenomenon and the temperature dependency of the density of @xmath32he , at so called @xmath33 point .",
    "@xmath32he has a discontinuity at this point , above which the density is rapidly growing on cooling , while , below , it saturates after showing some small spike @xcite .",
    "this fact was explained by a phase transformation , at the @xmath33 point , from a classic liquid regime to quantum one . in the quantum he ii phase , below the @xmath33 point ,",
    "the @xmath32he bosons cooperatively and synchronically rotate , in a vortex .",
    "thus , the additional cooperative quantum permanent movement of the bosons makes the density of the matter to saturate .",
    "quantum paraelectrics are other examples , which possess extremely high values of dielectric susceptibility in a wide temperature interval owing to quantum beatings @xcite . the dielectric permittivity in the quantum paraelectrics saturates , below the so called saturation temperature ( which is typically of 50 k ) .",
    "we emphasize here this kinetic aspect , because dielectric permittivity in the temperature interval below @xmath34 and above @xmath35 , in pmn , possesses giant magnitudes , which can be explained by the extreme softness of the vibration or / and relaxation modes .",
    "being based on these analogies , one can expect that , in pmn , at @xmath36 * , there also appears a cooperative atomic movement ( not necessarily totally synchronized quantum mechanically ) , which breaks the phonon anharmonicity .",
    "it is worth noting that the saturation of the dielectric permittivity in relaxors , below some temperature , has been already discussed @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "[ ] , the dielectric permittivity is represented in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is constant , @xmath39 with the relaxation time given by the vogel - fulcher formula @xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants .",
    "@xmath43 in equation ( [ epsilon ] ) is given by the landau - type expansion @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spontaneous polarization , and the coefficient @xmath46 is given by a barrett - like quantum formula    @xmath47    here @xmath48 is a characteristic temperature , which can be called also the saturation temperature ( in the spirit of the barrett formula @xcite ) .",
    "the theory under discussion does not give a clue about the physical origin of this temperature .",
    "notice that only dc dielectric susceptibility saturates , at low t , below @xmath48 , while , at any finite frequency , formula ( [ epsilon ] ) gives a one - peak function , with the peak position dependent on the frequency .    in the same year",
    ", experimental data , obtained for pmn , confirmed this kind of saturation of the dc dielectric susceptibility @xcite .",
    "later on @xcite , it was realised that the dielectric susceptibility can be presented in the form of the sherrington - kirkpatrick formula @xcite    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants , and @xmath53 is the ferroglass edwards - anderson parameter @xcite .",
    "thus , the deviation of the temperature evolution of the dielectric permittivity from the curie - weiss law was related to the emergence of the glass order parameter at @xmath35 @xcite . in the next sections",
    ", we will show that this understanding is not complete and requires to be supplemented by another temperature , namely , @xmath19 .",
    "besides the lattice parameter measurements and thermally stimulated acoustic emission described above , there are other evidences of the peciliar behavior of pmn in the close vicinity of @xmath54 , which we have already mentioned in introduction .",
    "these are dielectric permittivity anomaly @xcite , which was described as the emergence of a glass behavior , around 400 k , and the x - ray and neutron integrated diffraction intensity @xcite , which show clear appearance of the integral intensity around 400 k. we will treat both these evidences below , with the help of a model describing the quadrupole glass formation . at last , but not least , raman spectra in many studies ( see e.g. ref . [ ] ) confirmed to have the tetragonal - like splitting found , first , in ref .",
    "[ ] . in this section ,",
    "we suggest a model of the transformation of the spherical glass into the quadrupole glass .",
    "then , we will fit this model to the experimental data .",
    "raman spectra will be discussed in sec .",
    "let us focus on the lead atomic displacements in pmn . according to experimental findings , below @xmath5 ,",
    "the lead ions get off - center , and the strength of these off - centering s increases on cooling @xcite .",
    "this conclusion follows from the fact that the radial distribution of the lead displacements , below @xmath5 , gets split into two sets , with a gap in between .",
    "the gap appears , first , at those lead positions , which were not disturbed by the random fields ( high - temperature lead displacement is absent , for such positions ) .",
    "these off - centerings being combined into polar nano regions ( pnr s ) increase their strength on cooling , and , thus , increase the strength of the pnr s . however",
    ", this increase has some limit , because , when the random pnr s start touching each other , they organize larger superclusters ( not necesarily having global dipole moments , because of the disorder of the dipole directions in each of the pnr s ) , and , finally , these superclusters organize a net through the whole crystal . for",
    "the sake of illustration , let us consider a simple model free energy describing two interacting pnr s :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the distance between the lead pairs , @xmath57 is the correlation radius , the power @xmath58 is supposed to be large compared to 1 , @xmath59 is the relative correlation volume ( or density of the spherical off - centerings ) .",
    "@xmath60 is the inverse local ( spherical ) susceptibility , which decreases on cooling and acquires negative values below @xmath4 , resulting in the appearance of finite off - center spherical displacements . the first term in equation ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "represents the repulsion term which increases the free energy on approaching the correlation spheres of the nearest pnr s , each to the other , and has , originally , elastic nature @xcite .",
    "the next two terms ( @xmath61 is supposed to be positive , for simplicity ) define the temperature dependence of the volume @xmath62 , in the case , when the spherical centers are far each from the other .",
    "finally , by minimizing the free energy ( [ eq2 ] ) , one can find the equilibrium radii of the nearest pnr s .",
    "the average radius can be given by the cubic root of the inverse concentration of the lead pairs .",
    "the emergence of the quadrupole glass can be determined by the magnitude of the corresponding quadrupole glass order parameter , which can be constructed in the same way as the edwards - anderson parameter @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", one should take into account that this parameter is conjugate to the corresponding random strain variance , which makes the phase transition spread out over a significant temperature range , as we shall see later on .",
    "the development of the quadrupole glass in pmn is followed by the transformation of the phonon dynamics to the order - disorder one .",
    "indeed , we assume that the dipoles in the pnr s , due to the strong dipole - dipole interaction inside each of the pnr s , are relaxators .",
    "the growth of the correlation radius of the pnr s can be associated with the growth of the relaxation contribution to the dielectric permittivity on cooling .",
    "simultaneously , when these dynamical pnr s touch each other , i.e. , in other words , start to acquire a static component of strain ( this , we believe , happens below @xmath17 @xcite ) , they organize a new phase with the quadrupole order , which , fully or partially replaces the spherical glass state below @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we associate the temperature interval [ @xmath18,@xmath17 ] with the one , where the inhomogeneous strain organizes a steady state , and the relaxation contribution to the dielectric permittivity becomes critically important and practically substitutes the phonon contribution .",
    "this consideration correlates well with the development of the dielectric spectrum of pmn recently found experimentally by bovtun _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole glass can be described phenomenologycally by employing the following simple free energy @xmath64 where @xmath65 is polarization , q is the quadrupole glass order parameter , @xmath66 is the critical temperature , which , in the first approximation , equals @xmath18 , @xmath67 is the random strain variance , which becomes significant below @xmath17 .",
    "the equilibrium condition for @xmath68 now reads @xmath69 solutions of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) were studied in ref .",
    "[ ] . here , we consider the case of large @xmath67 : @xmath70 this order parameter appears well above @xmath66 and nearly linearly increases on cooling below @xmath71 .",
    "the emergence of the quardrupole glass order parameter is also behind the suppression of the ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "the soft ferroelectric mode behavior can be described by the following simple formula @xmath72 if we define temperature @xmath19 such that @xmath73 then , in the closest vicinity of @xmath19 , @xmath74 equation ( [ diffuse ] ) with @xmath75 being representative of the diffuseness of the transition , is one the main great features describing the dielectric behavior of relaxors , and now , we see that it might arise owing to the diffuse phase transition from the spherical glass to the quadrupole glass phase .",
    "figure 2 presents the result of our extraction of the @xmath76 temperature dependence from the experimentally measured dielectric permittivity at 100 khz , in the same manner as it was done in ref .",
    "the main result of this extraction is the following .",
    "@xmath76 is zero , above @xmath4 .",
    "it appears at @xmath5 , and gradually increases on cooling , down to @xmath77 .",
    "this latter temperature is the curie - weiss extrapolated critical temperature , from @xmath78 part .",
    "the smooth temperature behavior of @xmath76 is characteristic of diffuse phase transitions .",
    "below @xmath66 , the dependence of @xmath76 becomes more and more linear that is inherent to normal behavior of a scalar order parameter like the quadrupole glass order parameter , in the landau theory .",
    "we tried fitting eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) to the extracted from experiment @xmath76 curve , at a fixed value of @xmath79 .",
    "one can see from figure 3 ( curve 1 ) that the fitting curve well fits the linear portion of experiment , but lies well above experimental @xmath76 , at high temperatures .",
    "this deflection naturally stems from the fact that the random strain variance @xmath67 in formula ( [ formula ] ) is temperature independent .",
    "this makes @xmath76 finite at @xmath5 and above , in contrast to the experimental result . in order to fix this problem",
    ", one can follow the assumption about a temperature dependence of the random strain variance .",
    "let @xmath80 , at temperatures above @xmath5 , and , at lower temperatures , @xmath67 gradually increases , until a maximal ( saturated ) magnitude of this variance .",
    "one of the ways to check this assumption is using a hyperbolic tangent : @xmath81 for @xmath82 , and @xmath80 for @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath48 is the temperature interval , where @xmath67 saturates .",
    "figure 3 ( curve 2 ) shows that this assumption well suits experiment .",
    "thus , our data witness that the random field variance is zero , above @xmath5 , starts from zero at burns temperature and increases on cooling until some magnitude , and then saturates .",
    "very probably , the saturation happens in the quadrupole phase .",
    "figure 4 shows the integral intensity of the ( 001 ) bragg peak extracted from neutron pmn powder diffraction pattern measured at institut laue - langevin ( grenoble , france ) between 100k and 850k .",
    "the temperature dependence of this intensity is representative for all the bragg peaks ( not shown here ) .",
    "notice the changes of the slopes .",
    "the first change happens at a temperature located in the interval [ @xmath18,@xmath17 ] .",
    "the second does at the so - called freezing temperature @xmath6 ( see arrows ) .",
    "these changes are in good agreement with those observed on the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we assume that these abrupt changes of the integral intensity stem from the change of the diffuse scattering intensity .",
    "indeed , it was shown earlier @xcite that the diffuse scattering of neutrons with butterfly shape ( see the inset in figure 4 ) strongly increases below @xmath17 on cooling , while some diffuse scattering exists even above @xmath4 @xcite ( the latter is known as huang scattering on the quenched lattice parameter fluctuations , which can be described by chemical disorder of the nb and mg ions in the same sublattice ) .",
    "notice that the nature of the butterfly diffuse scattering has been intensively discussed in literature ( see the most resent discussion in ref .",
    "[ ] and references therein ) .",
    "this scattering , as it was understood , arises due to the thermal excitations of the combined optical and acoustic atomic vibrations , having strong anisotropy .",
    "the nature of this anisotropy is still debating . thus , this scattering manifests , in some sense , the transformation of the spherical glass into an anisotropic glass ( like the transformation of the heisenberg spins into ising ones @xcite ) .",
    "figure 5 presents fitting of the same function as in fig . 4 ( curve 2 ) , differing by only a factor , to the integral intensity of the neutron data , after subtraction of the high - temperature value of this intensity @xcite .",
    "one can see that this function nicely fits these data in the temperature interval above @xmath83 .",
    "this finding gives us significant information that the integral intensity of the diffuse scattering can be considered as a general order parameter of relaxors , in the same way as we got this parameter , @xmath76 , above , from the dielectric permittivity data .",
    "as it follows from equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , the soft mode hardens , because of the appearance of @xmath68 . on the other hand",
    ", the appearance of @xmath68 leads to a new contribution to the dielectric permittivity , due to the relaxations .",
    "the relaxation polarization , due to similarity in symmetry , may couple to the phonon displacements , and finally , can get cooperative .",
    "the combined phonon - relaxation response can be described analytically , in the mean - field approximation @xcite , and the final formula is given by equation ( [ epsilon ] ) . in the case if one considers zero - frequency , i.e. the dc ( field - cooled ) response , the trend of the total dielectric susceptibility , which includes both the relaxation and phonon parts is such that , below @xmath84 the dielectric permittivity keeps growing @xcite , with temperature decrease , and saturates , below @xmath6 .",
    "this makes the quadrupole phase having an extremely large value of the dielectric permittivity , in a wide temperature interval .",
    "however , at finite frequencies , this permittivity strongly decreases , below a frequency - related temperature , owing to the vogel - fulcher temperature dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "thus , the colossal dielectric response in pmn arises from the combination of the minimum of the soft mode and critically increasing , on cooling , edwards - anderson parameter @xmath68 corresponding to the quadrupole phase .",
    "these anomalies arise , in our opinion , due to three consequent diffuse phase transitions , at @xmath4 , @xmath19 , and @xmath6 , first , owing to phonon softening , towards @xmath19 , on cooling , and , then , due to the conversion of the phonon dynamics to the relaxation one , at lower temperatures , down to @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to stress the cooperative character of the polarization dynamics , due to the coupling of the phonons with the relaxations .",
    "recent experimental data @xcite showed that , in pmn , there are actually two soft modes , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , with quite different frequencies .",
    "this finding has not got yet a reasonable explanation .",
    "let us suggest that these two modes correspond to the regions covered by the pnr s correlation spheres , in which the soft mode frequency @xmath85 is supposed to be high , due to the existence of the local @xmath68 order parameter , and to the regions away from the pnr s volume , where the soft mode @xmath87 is not disturbed by @xmath68 . according to the experimental data @xcite , the temperature dependence of the mode @xmath87 frequency can be described by the curie - weiss law , with @xmath88 .",
    "this fact well corresponds to our assumption that @xmath89 , and that this temperature corresponds to the phase transition from the spherical glass to quadrupole glass phase .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath85 is much weaker @xcite , and this also corresponds to our assumption that the softening of this mode is responsible for the phase transition from the quadrupole to ferroglass phase . in order to check our assumption",
    ", one can measure the temperature dependency of the relative weight of these two modes .",
    "we suppose that @xmath85 becomes more populated than @xmath85 , with temperature decrease , because of the development of the quadrupole phase on cooling .",
    "one more remark concerns our assumption about the closeness of @xmath20 and @xmath90 ( see above ) .",
    "this conception assumes that , above @xmath4 , pmn presents a well seen development of the ferroelectric frequency softening , ornstein - cernice ( landau ) correlations , and curie - weiss behaviour of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "however , at lower temperatures , another tendency competes with the ferroelectric scenario .",
    "we believe that the appearance of @xmath68 order parameter can be described in a manner similar to the one suggested in ref . [ ] ( for the first general mathematical exploration if this competition see ref .",
    "[ ] , which introduced a new , trigger type , phase transition ) .",
    "these authors suggested that , in some of the relaxors , there can exist a scenario of a local phase transition and heterophase fluctuations .",
    "more specifically , the nonpolar local phase transition can happen in , say , pmn , at @xmath4 , because of the competition between the ferroelectric and , in our terminology , spherical glass order parameter . such a transition must be of first order , but , in our opinion , might be diffuse @xcite .",
    "so , similarly , we suggest that such kind of the phase transformation may happen also at a lower temperature , which we denoted as @xmath90 . here",
    "the phase transformation occurs between the spherical glass and quadrupole glass phases , and this transition , as we showed above ( see also ref . [ ] ) to be strongly diffuse .",
    "interestingly , at a lower temperature , @xmath35 , we again meet absolutely the same situation , but , now , between the quadrupole- and ferro- glass phases @xcite .",
    "thus , in our opinion , all three transformations follow the chu - setter - tagantsev scenario @xcite suggested earlier also as a general trigger mechanism [ ] .",
    "in this section , we will discuss possible scenarios of the tetragonal deformation of the lattice of pmn revealed by the raman studies @xcite .",
    "first of all , as soon as the shape of the crystal , in the whole temperature range , remains cubic , these tetragonal distortions must be local . in principle , the source for this distortion can be whether the strong dipole - dipole interactions between nearest pb displacements or the elastic ( or antiferroelectric ) interaction between next - to - nearest - neighbors . in the former case , the pb pairs , having in pmn [ 001 ] directions , can serve as tetragonal seeds for the lattice . in the latter case , the disordered incommensurate patterns , for example , in [ 110 ] directions , can result in the local tetragonal distortions .",
    "in general , the competition between the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric order can be behind the emergence of the stable pnr s with low local symmetry @xcite . as a consequence , these nano - objects can break the macroscopic polarization and help the emergence of the quadrupole glass phase .    as an example of such glass formation , the li pairs in the solid solution ktao@xmath91:li ( klt ) are tetragonal centers and organize an orthogonal ( 90-degree ) patterns made of these pairs , owing to the next - to - nearest elastic interactions @xcite .",
    "the situation in pmn can be different , because the pb sublattice does not contain any other ions but lead ( klt contains k and li in the same sublattice ) .",
    "however , the random fields , created by the random distribution of the mg and nb , in pmn , can make the lead ions different , and this difference is characterised by the magnitude ( and , generally , direction ) of the local electric field .",
    "for example , it was realized earlier that those lead ions , which possess the smallest local electric field , stemming from the random distribution of the mg and nb ions , are more ferroelectrically active , while those , which are embedded into a strong local field , are not ferroelectrically active @xcite .",
    "it is worth citing the recent first - principles calculations of the pmn relaxors diluted with pbtio@xmath91 revealing the tetragonal prevalence in the correlations between the atomic displacements @xcite .",
    "weak crystallization theory might be an adequate model for the pnr s growth in pmn @xcite . according to this theory",
    ", the nuclei of the new phase grow in such a manner that the magnitude of the correlation radius is an order parameter , but the direction is not ( the symmetry of the nucleus is spherical ) .",
    "a similar situation was recently shown to have some relevance to higgs boson @xcite .",
    "another example is the labyrinth structures observed in ultrathin films of lead titanate @xcite .    to answer the question about the reasons resulting in the tetragonal splitting of the raman lines in pmn @xcite",
    ", one needs performing more additional experiments and derivations .",
    "we have also considered the effect of the dynamic polarization , inherent to the quadrupole phase , on the dc photoconductivity @xmath92 of pmn . we studied a flux - grown pmn crystal having a form of cube ( with edges of 1.8 mm ) and with the faces parallel to the ( 001 ) planes of the prototype perovskite lattice .",
    "we put electrodes made of aquadag on two opposite faces of the crystal parallel to the incident light beam .",
    "we illuminated the crystal with incandescent light having the intensity of 100 mw .",
    "the absence of substantial heating of the crystal by the incident light was proved by close proximity of the permittivity - temperature curves measured at 1 khz , in the darkness and under continuous illumination .",
    "electric current was measured during slow ( 2 - 3 k / min ) heating rate by means of a v7 - 30 electrometer .",
    "figure 6 presents the results obtained . at low temperatures , below 210",
    "k i.e. @xmath6 , we found the logarithm of the photoelectric current increasing approximately linearly with respect to inverse temperature , like in semiconductors , with an activation energy of 0.08 ev . between 210 k and approximately 240 k ,",
    "the photoelectric current heavily decreased manifesting a catastrophic decrease of the mobility ( this finding is in line with the earlier measurements of the electron mobility in pmn @xcite ) , which we relate to the scattering of the electrons by the fluctuations of the crystal structure at the border between the ferro- and quadrupole glasses . then above 240 k",
    ", our experiment again shows a linear dependence of the logarithm of the electric current on the inverse temperature , but , this time , with a much larger activation energy than at low temperatures i.e. 0.35 ev against 0.08 ev at low temperature .",
    "this very strong increase of the activation energy is in line with our assumption of the existence in the lattice of a strong ( relaxation ) dynamic of the polarization .",
    "this dynamic makes the dielectric permittivity having extremely large magnitudes , and is reflected in the large magnitudes of the electric conductivity activation energies inherent to polarons @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that similar decrease of @xmath93 on heating was observed previously in the region of phase transitions between the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases in nanbo@xmath2 @xcite and between ferroelectric and paraelectric phases in cd@xmath94nb@xmath94o@xmath95 @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the measuring field strength was rather small ( @xmath96 along the [ 001 ] direction ) and could not induce the ferroelectric phase at low temperatures .",
    "finally , we have developed a model of pmn relaxor involving the recently discovered @xmath19 temperature .",
    "our model considers @xmath19 as a quasicritical temperature which manifests the transformation of the lead displacement pattern from the spherical glass to a quadrupole glass order .",
    "one of the evidences of the anisotropic order is the intense butterfly - like diffuse scattering which develops in this temperature interval , the tetragonal splitting of the raman lines , specific features in the neutron scattering @xcite , and the viehland _",
    "et al _ @xcite evidence of the glass order parameter .",
    "we believe that , on further temperature decrease , the quadrupole glass transforms into a ferroglass phase .",
    "we argued that all three diffuse phase transitions ( transformations ) ( at @xmath4 , @xmath66 , and @xmath6 ) follow the chu - setter - tagantsev scenario known generally also as a trigger mechanism @xcite .",
    "we have emphasized that the quadrupole glass possesses a cooperative relaxation - phonon dynamics , looking as cooperative beatings of the local polarization , which have some similarities with the boson vortex dynamics in the quantum phase of @xmath32he and with the zero - point atomic vibrations , in quantum paraelectrics . these beatings ( cooperative relaxations )",
    "suppress the development of the lattice parameter , form a colossal dielectric permittivity response , and result in a polaronic - like effect for the electrons .",
    "we hope that our model will find further experimental evidences , theoretical exploration and will be utilized to take advantage of the discovered transformations in the applications desiring giant dielectric responses , of non - electron nature , in wide temperature intervals around room temperature .",
    "sp and bd appreciate discussions of the topic with sergey vakhrushev , alexander tagantsev , and peter gehring .",
