    "the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sgr ) ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) has drawn considerable interest as a `` living '' example of the accretion process supposedly responsible for the creation of the outer galactic halo .",
    "most early sgr surveys focused within @xmath6-@xmath7 of its core ( e.g. , ibata _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , hereafter i97 , mateo _ et al .",
    "more recently , sgr - associated material has been identified farther from its main body ( e.g. , majewski _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , hereafter m99 ) , and it is becoming apparent that sgr tidal debris may envelop the whole galaxy roughly along the satellite s orbit .",
    "results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in two equatorial strips ( yanny _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , hereafter y00 ; ivezic _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , hereafter i00 ) find rr lyrae stars , blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars , and/or blue stragglers ( bs ) in excess of the galactic population that are most plausibly explained as sgr material ( see ibata _",
    "( 2002 , hereafter n02 ) confirm the previous sdss sgr detections with color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) showing main sequence turnoff colors ( msto ) consistent with those of sgr .",
    "similarly , martnez - delgado _ et al . _",
    "( 2001a , b ; collectively referred to as m01 ) report sgr detections associated with msto stars in several regions along the sgr orbital path .",
    "( 2001 ) confirm the i00 detection of rr lyrae stars in a @xmath8 kpc distant clump at positive galactic latitudes , while dohm - palmer _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) and kundu _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ; k02 hereafter ) report giant star concentrations in the inner halo having radial velocities ( rvs ) and distances in good agreement with wrapped tidal arms predicted from sgr disruption models .",
    "( 2001b ) also show that the carbon - star distribution from the totten & irwin ( 1998 , hereafter ti98 ) all - sky survey is highly correlated with the orbital path of sgr .    here",
    "we present absolute proper motions and @xmath9 color distributions in kapteyn selected area ( sa ) 71 , a galactic anticenter field located close to the orbital path of sgr ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we find a population of predominantly blue stars ( @xmath11 ) in excess of that predicted by standard galactic starcount models .",
    "the proper motions of the excess blue stars show a distinct , kinematically cooler population than the galactic field . assuming that the excess blue stars are horizontal branch ( hb ) stars",
    ", we estimate their distance to be @xmath12 kpc , a value consistent with sgr disruption model predictions ( e.g. , johnston 1998 , hereafter j98 ) .",
    "we also present @xmath9 color distributions for three other anticenter fields ( sa 29 , 45 and 118 ) .",
    "these allow us to refine some of the parameters of the starcount model .",
    "these three fields are consistent with each other and agree with the global model predictions .",
    "this work is a continuation of the photometric and proper motion study of sa 57 by majewski ( 1992 ) as well as the mount wilson halo mapping project ( sandage 1997 ) .",
    "star catalogs are derived from typically six mayall 4 m prime focus photographic plates ( plate scale @xmath13 mm@xmath14 ) per field : two each in the @xmath15 ( iiia - j+gg385 ) , @xmath16 ( iiia - f+gg495 ) and @xmath17 ( 127 - 04 + rg610 ) passbands . in this paper",
    "we present only the @xmath18 photometry data which we transform to the johnson @xmath19 system ( see majewski 1992 ) .",
    "the plates were digitized over a @xmath20 area with the university of virginia s perkin - elmer microdensitometer .",
    "the detection of objects , derivation of various image parameters and object classification were performed using the focas software package ( valdes 1982 , 1993 ) .",
    "calibration to standard johnson @xmath19 magnitudes used mount wilson 100-inch ( mw ) photoelectric photometry ( sandage 1997 , 2000 ) supplemented with : ccd data for sa 71 and 118 obtained with the swope 1 m telescope at las campanas observatory in 2001 and in 1993 respectively , massey s ( 1998 ) sa 45 data , and , for sa 29 , ccd photometry from the mayall 4 m and mosaic camera . from comparisons between the calibrated photographic and standard photoelectric / ccd magnitudes in the johnson system ,",
    "we find uncertainties in the calibrated magnitudes between 0.05 and 0.12 , and in @xmath9 between 0.07 and 0.15 , for the relevant magnitude range analyzed here .",
    "object classification relied on the resolution classifier described by valdes ( 1982 ) .",
    "inspection of images and derived image parameters for different classes of objects shows reliable classification to @xmath21 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "all fields are complete in terms of object detection to @xmath22 , except sa 118 , which is complete to @xmath23 .",
    "these `` completeness '' limits are 1.5 magnitudes above the plate limit . for the deeper plates ,",
    "stars brighter than @xmath24 show varying degrees of saturation , so we analyze only stars within @xmath25 . a detailed description of the calibration and object classification will be presented elsewhere .",
    "sa71 proper motions were determined from measurement of thirteen photographic plates spanning a 22-year baseline : eleven mayall 4 m plates ( of which six are the plates used for the photometry ) , and two modern du pont 2.5 m plates with two exposures ( short and long ) each .",
    "the emulsion+filter combination match the blue , visual and red passbands .",
    "the seeing varies between 1 to 3 arcsec , with the modern plates typically having better images .",
    "the photometric catalogs served as input lists for astrometric scans with the yale pds microdensitometer .",
    "general procedures for the astrometric reduction are described elsewhere ( e.g. , girard _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , dinescu _ et al .",
    "we have made use of the double exposures on the du pont plates to model magnitude - dependent systematics , and have corrected for differential color refraction for the appropriate photographic emulsion and hour angle following the prescription in dinescu _",
    "inspection of galaxy proper motions shows no detectable trends with colors and magnitudes .",
    "we obtain a proper - motion uncertainty of 0.8 mas yr@xmath14 per star for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 mas yr@xmath14 for @xmath28 .",
    "the correction to absolute proper motion is based on @xmath29 galaxies , but has an uncertainty of 0.2 mas yr@xmath14 due to poorer centering accuracy of the galaxy images .",
    "stellar color distributions are shown in figure 1 . in each panel ,",
    "the total counts for the data ( left numbers in parentheses ) and the starcount model ( right numbers ) are given .",
    "the starcount and kinematical model used here includes representations of the thin and thick disks and the halo .",
    "details of the model can be found in mndez & van altena ( 1996 , mva96 ) and mndez & guzmn ( 1998 ) .",
    "the `` best - fit '' model parameters were determined by eye from comparisons of all four fields in three @xmath30-magnitude bins : 17 - 18 , 18 - 19 , and 19 - 20 .",
    "we adopt a maximum thin disk scale - height of 300 pc to represent late - type main sequence stars and white dwarfs .",
    "the best - fit thick disk local normalization is @xmath31 of the thin disk with a 1000 pc scaleheight , with a 3.0 kpc scalelength for both disks .",
    "the halo is an oblate ( @xmath32 ) de vaucouleurs law spheroid of local normalization @xmath33 to the thin disk .",
    "the reddening for a given distance is derived from the extinction model presented in mndez & van altena ( 1998 ) , with infinite distance values from the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , hereafter sfd ) maps for the center of each sa field ( sa 29 , @xmath34 ; sa 45 , @xmath35 ; sa 71 , @xmath36 ; and sa 118 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the model color counts were convolved with the estimated photometric @xmath9 errors .",
    "field sa 45 partly contains the galaxy m33 in the east part of the field .",
    "therefore , we have analyzed the westernmost @xmath38 region of this field , which shows no m33-contamination in the cmd . for field sa71 , which has the largest reddening ,",
    "we have also determined star counts after dereddening star - by - star according to the sfd maps .",
    "the comparison with model counts yields similar results to when a single sa71 reddening value is applied .",
    "the sa 29 , 45 and 118 data agree well with model predictions in all three magnitude bins ( slight residual systematic errors may still exist in the photographic colors ) .",
    "however , sa 71 shows a clear excess of blue stars for @xmath39 compared to model predictions .",
    "this excess occurs for @xmath5 , and is most prominent in the @xmath40 bin .    in figure 2 ,",
    "left panels , we show the vector point diagram ( vpd ) for @xmath41 stars in two color groups : @xmath5 ( top panels ) and @xmath42 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the blue stars show a clump with dispersion @xmath43 mas yr@xmath14 and absolute mean proper motion @xmath44 cos @xmath45 and @xmath46 mas yr@xmath14 superimposed on a field population with wider dispersion .",
    "the absolute proper - motion uncertainty is given by the proper - motion measuring error for galaxies and the proper - motion dispersion of the excess blue star clump .",
    "the red stars show a wide proper motion distribution typical of the galactic field .",
    "intuitively , blue field stars have a lower dispersion than red ones , because red stars are predominantly ( see figure 1 ) nearby disk k - m dwarfs , which have larger proper motions , while blue stars are primarily more distant thick disk and halo stars .",
    "however , the adjoining plots of @xmath47 ( middle panels ) and @xmath48 ( right panels ) distributions show more complex character .",
    "the continuous lines represent the proper motion distributions predicted from the mva96 galactic model , which evidently agree reasonably well with the data for the red stars , whereas the blue sample shows an excess population with a lower dispersion than that of the field .",
    "we have also obtained preliminary proper motions in sa 29 , a field located symetrically to sa 71 across the galactic plane .",
    "the sa29 proper - motion distributions do not show the excess blue star population seen in sa 71 .",
    "in figure 3 we show in aitoff projection the location of our sa fields , most known detections ( filled symbols ) and non - detections ( open symbols ) of sgr material , and the orbit of sgr as determined from the ground - based proper - motion measurement of i97 ( continuous line ) .",
    "sa 71 is located close to sgr s orbit , and to a clump of five carbon stars found in the surveys of ti98 and green _ et al . _",
    "these five carbon stars belong to two groups : 1 ) three stars with @xmath17 magnitudes 15.1 , 15.5 , and 16.4 and heliocentric rvs of -133 , -140 , and -140 km s@xmath14 respectively ( highlighted crosses in fig .",
    "3 ) ; 2 ) two stars with @xmath49 and 13.0 and rvs of 112 and 43 km s@xmath14 respectively . except for the faintest carbon star , which is of ch type , all",
    "are n type ; according to ti98 , the n type can be assigned an absolute magnitude @xmath50 . using the sfd reddening values for each location of the carbon stars",
    ", we obtain that the fainter group resides at distances 35 - 44 kpc from the sun . > from the sdss - south survey ( y00 , n02 ) , which is close to sa 71 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the distance to the candidate sgr hb stars is @xmath51 kpc .",
    "the distances of the carbon stars and of the hb stars in sdss - south match the distances predicted for tidal debris from sgr at this galactic location ( see e.g. , helmi & white 2001 , hereafter hw01 ; m01 ) .",
    "moreover , the large , negative rvs of three of the carbon stars ( the highlighted crosses in fig .",
    "3 ) also match the model predictions for a stream from sgr that consists of material lost at the previous pericenter passage ( sgr is currently at pericenter , see e.g , hw01 , ibata _ et al . _",
    "2001b ) .    considering the proximity of sa 71 to directions where sgr material has been detected , we can plausibly associate the excess blue stars in sa 71 with sgr material . for @xmath40",
    "the excess stars peak at @xmath52 ( @xmath53_0 =   0.78 $ ] ) a color consistent with sgr s hb / red clump ( bellazzini , ferraro & buonanno 1999 ) .",
    "> from inspection of the sa 71 cmd , we adopt @xmath4 as the magnitude of the candidate sgr hb , corresponding to a heliocentric distance of 29 - 32 kpc ( the distance range derives from the absolute magnitude spread for rr lyrae stars of metallicities relevant to sgr ) . the estimated distance to the candidate sgr hb",
    "is in agreement with those of the carbon stars , the hb stars found in sdss - south , and model predictions ( hw01 , m01 ) .",
    "the excess population with @xmath54 is bluer than that with @xmath55 , and resembles the bs population found in y00 and n02 .    from kinematics of tidal stream material calculated with the semianalytical disruption model developed by j98 for sgr and the measured orbit by i97",
    ", we find the nearest model sgr stripped material to sa71 is at @xmath56 .",
    "this material belongs to a trailing stream that emerged during the previous perigalacticon passage ( 0.75 gyr ago ) .",
    "the debris is located 26 kpc from the sun , and has @xmath57 mas yr@xmath14 , @xmath58 mas yr@xmath14 , and @xmath59 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the vertical lines in the proper - motion distributions of fig .",
    "2 represent these predicted proper motions ( all are presented in the heliocentric rest frame ) . to understand better the debris motion",
    ", we subtract the reflex solar motion from our sa 71 proper - motion measurement , at a distance of 26 kpc .",
    "we obtain @xmath60 mas yr@xmath14 , and @xmath61 mas yr@xmath14 . for the model predictions we obtain @xmath62 mas yr@xmath14 , and @xmath63 mas yr@xmath14 .",
    "while there is good agreement in @xmath64 , the predicted value of @xmath48 is larger in absolute value than that measured .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to uncertainties in the model predictions stemming from the 0.7 mas yr@xmath14 uncertainty in the proper motion of sgr ( i97 ) , and/or it may be due to undetected systematics in our proper - motion measurement . a full exploration of models with varying initial conditions may help understand this discrepancy , but is beyond the purpose of this letter . given the almost polar orbit of sgr ( the latitude of the pole is @xmath65 , ibata _ et al . _",
    "2001b ) , one might want to compare the direction of our measured velocity vector to that estimated from orbit - shape considerations only .",
    "however , we caution that , given the small size of the measured proper motion compared to its uncertainty , the direction is rather poorly constrained .",
    "a small - size latitudinal motion is quite conceivable because debris in this particular stream reaches its turning point below the galactic plane at a galactic location close to that of sa 71 ( see e.g. , fig . 3 in ibata _ et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "assuming a 1.7 mas yr@xmath14 lower limit for the proper - motion dispersion ( as given by the @xmath48 distribution of the excess blue stars ) , and an 0.8 mas yr@xmath14 measurement uncertainty , we obtain a 213 km s@xmath14 intrinsic velocity dispersion of the clump of blue stars at 30 kpc .",
    "this dispersion is too large for a coherent structure to last for 0.75 gyr .",
    "it is more plausible that we sample material lost in several previous passages that is located at various distances , and thus has a wide range in kinematics .",
    "the existence of multiple , overlapping sgr streams is suggested by m99 , dinescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , dohm - palmer et al . ( 2001 ) , and k02 .",
    "an alternative or additional explanation is that galactic thick disk stars contaminate our blue sample and thereby inflate the estimated dispersion ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . as shown by k02 , radial velocities can help disentangle streams left by previous sgr passages , ( if this interpretation is correct ) and also help separate field stars from sgr candidates .",
    "the largest excess of blue stars is at @xmath40 .",
    "the difference between the data and the starcount model for stars with @xmath5 is @xmath66 , yielding a density of @xmath67 star arcmin@xmath68 .",
    "for the sdss - south detection , n02 estimate a density three times lower than that of sdss - north .",
    "n02 find 500 red clump stars in the sdss - north along an orbital path of @xmath69 .",
    "for our @xmath70 field , the sdss - south density implies 25 red clump stars , or @xmath43 times lower than our determination .",
    "hw01 predict a rather high density of sgr material at @xmath71 , a location close to sa 71 .",
    "they derive a density relative to the main body of sgr of @xmath72 number - counts arcdeg@xmath68 .",
    "if the main body of sgr contains 34,000 red hb stars ( ibata , gilmore and irwin [ 1995 ] find 17,000 red clump stars within the half - mass radius of the main body of sgr ) , then we should find 77 red hb stars in our sa71 area , according to the hw01 model .",
    "this number is also within a factor of 2 of our excess counts .",
    "we thank m. catelan for providing us hb models , m. irwin for making available the carbon star data , and a. helmi and k. johnston for discussions concerning the sgr disruption models .",
    "srm thanks the carnegie observatories for access to las campanas facilities .",
