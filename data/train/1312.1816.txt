    "due to advances in emissions control technology and regulatory action , air quality has been improving over the last several decades in the united states and europe .",
    "however , areas exist where significant populations are still exposed to elevated levels of tropospheric ozone ( o@xmath0 ) .",
    "epidemiological and controlled human exposure studies have shown an association between o@xmath0 exposure and respiratory and cardiovascular endpoints , particularly in sensitive populations [ us epa ( @xcite ) ] . furthermore , ozone has been linked to a variety of adverse effects on vegetation and ecosystems [ us epa ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "ozone , together with other compounds , is formed downwind of its two main classes of precursors , volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) and nitrogen oxides ( no@xmath1no@xmath2no@xmath3 ) in the presence of sunlight . due to the complexities of the formation processes of secondary pollutants such as ozone and their dependence on various physical and chemical parameters , as well as meteorological conditions ,",
    "ozone is a highly nonlinear function of its inputs and , thus , regional three - dimensional eulerian photochemical models have been developed to track the precursor emissions , transport , and chemical transformations of gases and particles in the troposphere .",
    "such models are used to study the formation and geographical distribution of ozone and also to provide a test bed for possible control strategies .",
    "for example , we use the community multiscale air quality ( cmaq ) model [ @xcite ] to study changes in ozone levels due to changes in mobile - source no@xmath4 emissions , point - source no@xmath4 emissions , other no@xmath4 emissions , anthropogenic vocs emissions , and biogenic vocs emissions . due to the prevalence of ozone precursor emissions from a wide range of sources , differing chemical reactivities of the various specific chemical compounds that make up vocs , and the varying cost of different control technologies ,",
    "the processes of control strategy evaluation is itself complex .",
    "control strategy evaluation seeks to understand the potential response in air quality levels from various targeted reductions of source pollutants . by studying control strategies ,",
    "we understand how resources should be allocated to achieve the best results .",
    "control strategies must be studied via atmospheric chemistry models where it is possible to change emissions scenarios . in the context of control strategy evaluation , it is the response of modeled concentration that is desired as a surrogate for the response for actual atmospheric pollutant levels . such response can be obtained most basically by performing two modeling simulations : one representing current conditions ; and one representing conditions under a specific emissions control scenario .",
    "the difference in predicted concentrations from the two simulations could then be attributed to the control strategy .",
    "currently , the computational costs of running full regional photochemical models are still nontrivial , making such evaluations potentially costly . to address this issue ,",
    "various methods have been applied to develop reduced form models ( rfms ) that represent pollutant concentrations for a particular episode of interest as a simple function of usually only the regulatory controllable parameters . for example , in the rfm , ozone only may be a function of parameters for the various anthropogenic sources no@xmath4 and vocs for a particular place and time .",
    "one of the various methods for developing rfms to date is through calculating sensitivity coefficients of a target pollutant to emissions of precursors from controllable sectors .",
    "these sensitivities are subsequently used to make adjustments to pollutant concentrations predicted by a base model simulation [ @xcite ] .",
    "we propose a new approach for combining an rfm with monitored point - level ozone data to study effects of various control strategies .",
    "our approach is geared toward accurately characterizing extreme ozone events under different scenarios .",
    "extreme ozone is a concern for health effects modeling and regulation .",
    "for example , the current epa regulation of ozone is based on the fourth highest daily eight - hour average ozone ( i.e. , the maximum eight - hour average ozone concentrations for the day ) of the year . extreme value theory ( evt )",
    "[ see @xcite for an overview ] provides an asymptotically - justified approach to modeling the tails of wide classes of distributions .",
    "our model employs a parametric form suggested by extreme value theory in the tail , while utilizing a flexible quantile regression approach to model the bulk of the distribution .",
    "cmaq output and monitor data are not directly comparable , as cmaq output is defined as a volume average within a three - dimensional grid cell and we wish to make inference about ozone at point locations .",
    "thus , we build a downscaler , that is , a statistical model that links gridded numerical model output to point - level observational data [ see @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "most downscaling work employs a gaussian process framework [ e.g. , @xcite ] and focuses on modeling the conditional mean of the observations given the numerical model output . for example , @xcite use this approach for ozone control - strategy evaluation .",
    "some recent work has sought to move beyond the parametric gaussian paradigm .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite propose separate models for the quantile process of the model output and the quantile process of the point - located data , which provides a calibration function to link the two sources of data .",
    "@xcite propose an evt - based downscaling method for extreme precipitation , relating the return levels ( i.e. , extreme quantiles , a climatological quantity ) of the model output to return levels at point - located sites . unlike the previous downscaling work for ozone which focused on calibration , our focus is prediction . specifically ,",
    "once our downscaler is constructed to relate monitor data to rfm output under observed emissions , we use it to study the effect of alternative emission scenarios .",
    "other work which has appeared in the climate literature applies evt to numerical model output in order to produce maps summarizing the extreme behavior of the studied variable .",
    "one approach [ e.g. , @xcite ] is to fit extreme value distributions separately to the output at individual grid cells , perhaps employing spatial smoothing procedures after the pointwise fitting to produce the maps .",
    "another approach [ e.g. , @xcite ] constructs hierarchical bayesian models that pool information across space by incorporating spatial random effects .",
    "these works differ fundamentally in both aim and approach from the present work .",
    "these previous studies aim to describe the tail of the ( unconditional ) distribution and treat the numerical model output as data , whereas we aim to model the conditional distribution of the point - located measurements treating the model output as covariate information .",
    "our work is somewhat related to recent work which has sought to link extreme behavior to large - scale climatological conditions .",
    "@xcite model the connection between extreme cold temperatures and atmospheric blocking conditions as produced by both reanalysis models and climate models .",
    "@xcite link extreme precipitation to large - scale airflow .",
    "similar to the model we present in section [ smodel ] , @xcite and @xcite both condition the parameters of the extreme value distribution on the covariate information .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite model only the maximum value over a block of time , for example , monthly or yearly maximum of daily value .",
    "in contrast , we use all observations to both flexibly model the center of the distribution and model the upper tail using evt given any level of the covariate .",
    "our approach is novel for several reasons .",
    "first , the aim of our analysis is to investigate control strategies .",
    "the rfm model is simple enough to permit re - evaluation for a new set of input parameters at negligible computing cost . as a result ,",
    "we are able to embed the rfm inside the bayesian model to make inference on the input parameters based on the resulting fit of the rfm to the monitor data , as in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for gaussian data . therefore , unlike previous downscaler methods for extremes [ @xcite ]",
    ", we do not estimate the densities of the model and monitor data separately . to make full use of the rfm , we model the conditional distribution of the monitor data given the rfm .",
    "second , our model for the conditional distribution of the monitor data given the rfm has attractive features .",
    "evt tells us that observations which exceed a high threshold are well - approximated by the generalized pareto ( gpd ) distribution .",
    "therefore , in contrast to most previous methods for downscaling numerical model output , here we explicitly leverage evt by specifying that the conditional distribution of monitor data given the rfm has a gpd tail .",
    "however , modeling only the extremes is not sufficient here , since even the center of the conditional distribution of the monitor data given an extremely large value of the rfm may in fact be extreme .",
    "this requires that we construct a flexible model for the entire conditional distribution which uses evt to characterize the upper tail .",
    "our overall model is a combination of quantile regression and evt , employing quantile regression at levels where there is adequate information to fit a flexible model and evt in the tail , which allows one to extrapolate beyond the range of the data .",
    "we assume that evt is appropriate for the upper tail of the conditional distribution given any value of the rfm ( high or low ) and allow the gpd distribution to vary with the rfm and spatial location .",
    "our work is similar in spirit with a recent study by @xcite , who use a related strategy for probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasting .",
    "they estimate a conditional mixture with a gpd tail , although without spatial variation in the parameters or a rfm with unknown input parameters .",
    "third , rather than using the standard diagnostic tools to select a threshold , our model estimates the threshold above which evt becomes appropriate .",
    "prior work on threshold estimation is limited ; @xcite use a mixture of a parametric light - tailed distribution and a gpd , and @xcite use a semi - parametric center and gpd tail and estimate the threshold in a bayesian way .",
    "the community multiscale air quality ( cmaq ) model [ @xcite ] , version 4.7.1 [ @xcite ] , is chosen as the regional photochemical transport model used as the base simulation , from which we later construct our rfm .",
    "ozone was simulated hourly with cmaq in a domain centered on the southeastern united states for an episode between july 1 , 2005 and september 30 , 2005 , with the full month of june 2005 as a spin - up period .",
    "eight - hour average ozone is then computed using the hourly values .",
    "standard model configuration was used with a 12  km by 12  km horizontal grid spacing and 14 vertical layers from the surface to 100 hpa , and the statewide air pollution research center ( saprc99 ) gas - phase chemical mechanism [ @xcite ] .",
    "meteorological fields were developed using the fifth generation mesoscale model ( mm5 ) , version 3.6.3 [ @xcite ] , and chemical emissions based on the 2001 national emissions inventory ( http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/index.html#2001[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/ ] http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/index.html#2001[index.html#2001 ] ) were processed using the smoke processor , version 2.3.2 ( http://www.smoke-model.org ) , augmented with year 2005 specific emissions data for electric generating units equipped with continuous emission monitoring systems ( cems ) , mobile emissions processed by mobile  6 ( http://www.epa.gov/otaq/m6.htm ) , and meteorologically adjusted biogenic emissions from the biogenic emission inventory system ( beis ) 3.13 [ @xcite ] .",
    "when model runs are computationally intensive and many runs are required for a thorough sensitivity analysis , an approximation to the model output can be used .",
    "one such technique is the decoupled direct method in three dimensions ( ddm-3d ) .",
    "this gives a reduced - form cmaq ( rf - cmaq ) model described below .",
    "eulerian photochemical models such as cmaq typically simulate the emissions , transport , and chemistry of gases and particles in the atmosphere by numerically solving the atmospheric diffusion equation [ @xcite ] @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the concentration of species @xmath7 at time @xmath8 and location  @xmath9 ( with notation for space and time dropped for simplicity ) , @xmath10 is fluid velocity , @xmath11 is the diffusivity tensor , @xmath12 is the net rate of chemical generation of species , and @xmath13 is the species emissions rate .",
    "ddm-3d computes first - order semi - normalized sensitivity coefficients @xmath14 to perturbations in an input parameter @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a scaling variable with a nominal value of 1.0 applied to the unperturbed parameter field , @xmath18 as @xmath19 . differentiating ( [ ade ] )",
    "while using the above definitions leads to an analogous equation governing the first - order sensitivity field @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the unperturbed emission rate , and @xmath22 is the @xmath23th row vector in the jacobian matrix @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) representing the chemical interaction between species as the previously undefined terms .",
    "calculations for second - order sensitivity coefficients are also possible and are defined as @xmath26 for a given species , taylor series expansion can be used to approximate the concentration @xmath27 as a function of perturbations in a set of input parameters of interest using first- and second - order sensitivity coefficients [ @xcite ] . in this application",
    "we are interested only in the concentration of a single species , ozone , and , therefore , the subscript @xmath23 is dropped .",
    "the rf - cmaq model for @xmath28 parameters including second - order and cross - sensitivities is @xmath29 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } + 0.5\\sum_{l\\ne j}s^{(2)}_{lj}(t , { \\mathbf{s}})\\alpha_j\\alpha_l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the ozone concentration due to a specific set of perturbations @xmath31 at time @xmath8 and location @xmath9 , @xmath32 is unperturbed concentrations from the base cmaq simulation , and @xmath33 is the perturbation in input parameter @xmath15 .",
    "for example @xmath34 corresponds to 10% decrease in no@xmath4 emissions compared to the no@xmath4 emissions used for @xmath35 .",
    "the sensitivity coefficients produced by ddm-3d vary in space and time , providing a computationally efficient calculation of ozone under different perturbations in emissions inputs through the rfm .",
    "for example , in urban centers no@xmath4 emissions frequently act as a sink of ozone resulting in negative sensitivity to sectors involving no@xmath4 emissions [ figure [ fdata](c ) ] . in this analysis we consider sensitivity to @xmath36 inputs : mobile - source no@xmath4 emissions ( e.g. , traffic ) , point - source no@xmath4 emissions ( e.g. , power plants ) , other no@xmath4 emissions ( e.g. , construction equipment ) , anthropogenic vocs emissions ( e.g. , benzene emitted from fuel combustion by motor vehicles ) , biogenic vocs emissions ( e.g. , limonene emitted from pine trees ) , and ozone boundary conditions ( 3-d hourly pollutant concentrations specified at the grid cells surrounding the model domain ) .",

    "this second - order rfm is used as an emulator for the full cmaq model .",
    "that is , we use ( [ c ] ) to approximate the spatiotemporal output that would result from an evaluation of the full cmaq model for a new set of perturbations @xmath39 .",
    "this rfm has been shown to have normalized mean error within 10% of reevaluating the full model for @xmath39 perturbations up to @xmath40100% [ @xcite ] .",
    "an important caveat is that @xcite did not address differences between the full cmaq and rfm for extreme values , which could potentially have greater impact on projections of extremes .",
    "using the rf - cmaq model provides substantial computational improvement .",
    "a single month - long simulation using the full cmaq model takes approximately 10 hours using 72 processors on an ibm system x idataplex .",
    "the ddm-3d model on the same system runs in approximately 10 days but gives us the ability to estimate pollutant concentrations under many different emissions levels . in the paper ,",
    "the bayesian framework allows us to evaluate the reduced form model at thousands of different emissions perturbations to create posterior distributions of the ozone concentration across space .",
    "in contrast , running the full model just 100 times in order to roughly approximate the uncertainty in the emissions inputs would require more than a month of computational time .",
    "therefore , rf - cmaq is the only viable way of exploring the effects of control strategies while accounting for uncertainty in the emissions inputs .",
    "ozone predictions are also paired in time and space with hourly average ozone observations obtained from epas air quality system ( aqs ; http://www.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/ ) .",
    "this analysis focuses on the maximum eight - hour average ozone concentrations per day ( md8 o@xmath0 ) for july 1 to september 30 in 2005 at 307 monitoring stations in the southeastern us in figure  [ fdata](c ) . the md8 is the averaging metric of interest , because it is used for determining compliance with the epa s national ambient air quality standards for ozone .",

    "our objective is to estimate the conditional distribution of @xmath41 given rf - cmaq output for the grid cell containing location  @xmath9 , denoted @xmath30 .",
    "as described in section [ srfm ] , the perturbation vector @xmath39 is treated as an unknown parameter in the hierarchical model to allow the aqs data to determine the optimal adjustment to the initial emission levels . for notational convenience",
    ", we temporarily suppress dependence on @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath39 and simply describe the model for @xmath43 given @xmath44 .",
    "we specify a flexible semiparametric model below a threshold @xmath45 where data are abundant , and transition to a parametric gpd model above a threshold where data are sparse .",
    "the models above and below the threshold are described in sections [ sgp ] and [ squantreg ] , respectively .",
    "the parametric gpd distribution has three parameters : lower bound @xmath46 , scale @xmath47 , and shape @xmath48 .",

    "typically a threshold is selected to be the gpd lower bound , @xmath45 . unlike typical extreme value analysis , rather than choosing a threshold , we instead treat it as a parameter in the model - fitting process .    as shown in figure [ fdata ] , the distribution of aqs values is highly dependent on the rf - cmaq output .",
    "therefore , we assume that the semiparametric / parametric threshold depends on @xmath44 .",

    "it is also possible to use the other basis function @xmath70 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath70 to be the gamma or log - normal distribution function would ensure a lower bound @xmath95 .",

    "note that this polynomial model contains the linear regression model as a special case and that in this case the intercept can account for systematic bias between the aqs data and the rf - cmaq predictions .",

    "we allow the parameters that define the semiparametric model below the threshold , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , as well as the gpd scale @xmath124 to vary by spatial location .",

    "the hyperparameters have priors @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath133 . to borrow strength across processes , we assume a common spatial range @xmath134 , which is reasonable since all of these spatially - varying parameters represent the change in response distribution across locations .    we find that while the threshold parameters @xmath135 and gpd shape parameters @xmath136 are well identified",
    "when allowed to vary by the value of rf - cmaq , they are poorly identified when allowed to vary by rf - cmaq and spatial location .",
    "this is not surprising since they are by definition related only to the tail of the distribution and , thus , there are only a few relevant observations at each location .",
    "these parameters are thus held constant for all locations with priors @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "we note that although the threshold is fixed at a constant quantile level across space , the actual threshold on the ozone scale is @xmath139=q_0\\{t[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}})]|c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}}),{\\mathbf{s}}\\}$ ] , which does vary spatially .",
    "also , since the interpretation of the gpd scale is dependent on the threshold , it seems a reasonable approach to not allow the parameters dictating the threshold to vary spatially and to assume that the spatially varying scale parameter can account for spatial variation . combining these specifications gives the final quantile model fit to the ozone data in section [ sanalysis ] , @xmath140 , \\qquad \\tau\\le t\\bigl[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}| { \\bolds{\\alpha}})\\bigr ] , \\vspace*{2pt}\\cr \\displaystyle \\operatorname{qgpd } \\biggl\\{\\frac{\\tau - t[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}})]}{1-t[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}})]}\\big| \\mu\\bigl[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}})\\bigr ] , \\sigma \\bigl[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}}),{\\mathbf{s}}\\bigr],\\vspace*{2pt}\\cr \\hspace*{185pt}\\xi\\bigl[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}})\\bigr ] \\biggr\\},\\vspace*{2pt}\\cr \\hspace*{105pt}\\tau > t\\bigl[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}})\\bigr],}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 = \\beta[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}}),{\\mathbf{s } } ] + \\sum_{l=1}^l b_l(\\tau)\\theta_l[c(t,{\\mathbf{s}}|{\\bolds{\\alpha}}),{\\mathbf{s}}]$ ] .",
    "even after accounting for spatial variation in the conditional distributions , there is spatial and temporal dependence in the residuals due to day - to - day variation in ozone .",
    "we account for this dependence with a gaussian copula [ @xcite ] .",
    "the copula is defined by a latent gaussian process @xmath142 with mean zero , variance one , and a spatiotemporal correlation function",

    "while the gaussian copula induces some spatiotemporal dependence , it is well known that the gaussian copula gives asymptotic independence .",

    "therefore , the gaussian copula may not be ideal for extreme data in all settings .",
    "however , our exploratory analysis in section  [ sanalysis ] suggests that there is little extremal dependence in the residuals and , therefore , that this model fits the aqs data well after accounting for rf - cmaq output .",
    "in other cases , copulas with asymptotic dependence may be desirable .",
    "examples of copulas with asymptotic dependence include the t - copula [ @xcite ] or a nonparametric copula [ @xcite ] .",
    "another possibility is to specifically target extremal dependence [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the computing used for the ozone data analysis has two main steps : we first analyze the aqs data to estimate the parameters in the conditional distribution of aqs given rf - cmaq , and then generate replications of the summer ozone process under different control strategies . these two steps are described separately in the subsections below .",
    "because of the size of the data set , we fit this model in two stages .",
    "we first estimate @xmath39 and the @xmath149 parameters for @xmath150 in one model fit assuming the observations are independent conditioned on these parameters . in the second stage , we estimate the copula parameters conditioned on the first - stage parameter estimates . assuming independence of the observations conditioned on @xmath151 , the likelihood is simply the product of terms of the form of ( [ density ] ) .",

    "none of the parameters in the likelihood have conjugate full conditionals , so we use metropolis  hastings sampling . metropolis ",

    "@xcite does include residual spatiotemporal dependence for spatial quantile regression . although estimating residual spatial dependence in not the primary focus in this work , failing to account for this may cause underestimation of the uncertainty of model parameters .",
    "also , although the quantile function is modeled as increasing for each value of the rfm , the quantile function is not forced to be increasing in rfm for each quantile level , as one would naturally expect . including this prior belief may be possible by adding further restrictions to the polynomial coefficients in the conditional distribution and",
    "would certainly improve the fit for small and moderate data sets .",
    "also , we note that our analysis only considers global emission control strategies that assume a uniform reduction in emissions across the entire spatial domain .",
    "an extension would be to calculate sensitivities to local changes , to study the effects of emission reduction in one grid cell on neighboring cells .",
