    "according to the standard paradigm , millisecond pulsars are accelerated to their fast rotation rates by accreting matter from a close companion .",
    "this means that they tend to be relatively old .",
    "moreover , the fastest spinning pulsars should have weak ( exterior ) magnetic fields . in the standard accretion model , neutron stars with canonical @xmath1  g dipole fields",
    "will reach equilibrium already at a modest spin .",
    "a weak surface field is also expected since accretion leads to magnetic field burial .",
    "this picture agrees well with observational data . rapidly rotating neutron stars are most commonly found in binary systems .",
    "it is well established that accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( where the angular momentum transfer is more efficient due to the long evolution time of the low mass partner ) can reach a millisecond rotation period .",
    "furthermore , the fastest known millisecond pulsar j1748 - 2446ad , with a period of 1.39  ms  @xcite , is in a binary system . in fact , its companion , with mass @xmath2 , could still fill the roche lobe powering the spin - up phase further .",
    "the mass and radius of j1748 - 2446ad are unknown , but combining reasonable ranges for these parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with an empirical formula for the maximum rotation of the star  @xcite @xmath5 one finds that the spin of this object lies in the range @xmath6 . in other words , it could be close to the mass - shedding limit .",
    "the temperature of a mature neutron star is likely below the critical temperature , @xmath7  k , where neutrons and protons are superfluid and superconducting , respectively . depending on the cooling mechanism",
    ", neutrino emission can cool a hot proto - neutron star below this temperature shortly after its formation in a core collapse supernova  ( see e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "in an accreting system , the neutron star core temperature is not expected to increase beyond @xmath8 ( nuclear burning in the accreted surface layers is thought to the heat the core to @xmath9  k ) .",
    "hence , all mature neutron stars should contain degenerate superfluid neutrons in the outer core and the inner crust and degenerate superconducting protons in the outer core .",
    "the deep core may contain more exotic phases of matter , like superfluid hyperons and/or colour superconducting quarks .",
    "superfluidity influences the thermal evolution and the dynamical properties of a neutron star . in particular , the dynamics is strongly affected by entrainment , the formation of quantized neutron vortices , and the presence of new dissipative mechanisms like mutual friction .",
    "an understanding of superfluid dynamics is crucial for modelling many aspects of the neutron star physics , ranging from pulsar glitches and free precession to the mutual friction damping of stellar oscillations and associated instabilities .",
    "tidal forces , accretion and glitches may trigger oscillations and/or instabilities in rapidly rotating neutron stars",
    ". observations of such oscillations , either via electromagnetic or gravitational radiation , would help us explore the exotic physics of these compact objects @xcite . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note the differences in dynamics between neutron stars above the superfluid transition temperature and colder systems .",
    "the core of a hot young neutron star is relatively well described by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "in contrast , a star with a superfluid core requires a multi - fluid description .",
    "the standard model for such systems is inspired by the two - fluid model for superfluid helium  @xcite .",
    "the oscillation spectrum of superfluid neutron stars reflects the presence of the additional degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "basically , the perturbed fluid elements in a two - fluid system can oscillate either in phase or in a counter - phase motion .",
    "previous studies , see for example , , have established that co - moving pulsations have spectral properties similar to single fluid stars .",
    "hence , it is natural to refer to such modes as `` ordinary '' modes .",
    "the counter - moving degree of freedom leads to new oscillation modes that are specific to the two - fluid systems .",
    "these are often referred to as `` superfluid '' modes .",
    "later , when we write down the perturbation equations for a superfluid neutron star core , we choose to work with variables that are directly associated with the two types of motion .",
    "this is natural if we want to distinguish spectral properties associated with the  superfluid `` degree of freedom .",
    "in addition , we use the standard classification of neutron star oscillation modes , based on the main restoring force that acts on a perturbed fluid element .",
    "a rotating single fluid star can sustain acoustic and inertial modes restored by pressure and the coriolis force , respectively . when thermal or composition gradients are present in the star , buoyancy acts as restoring force for the so - called gravity modes  @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that superfluid neutron stars have two families of acoustic and inertial modes , more or less clearly ( depending on the stellar model ) associated with the co- and counter - moving fluid motion .",
    "it is , however , not the case that all single fluid modes have a ' ' double \" in the superfluid problem .",
    "the gravity modes are not present at all in a superfluid core  .",
    "their absence provides a potentially important signature for neutron star seismology .    rapidly rotating neutron stars",
    "have been studied in detail with a variety of methods  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "yet , there have not been any previous studies of multi - fluid dynamics in the rapid rotation regime near the break - up limit .",
    "the oscillation modes of superfluid neutron stars have only been calculated in the frequency domain using the slow rotation approximation  @xcite . in that framework , the effects of the stellar rotation are determined perturbatively as corrections to the non - rotating results . the only previous attempt ( that we are aware of ) to study superfluid oscillations for truly fast spinning stars is the work by @xcite .",
    "they extended the two - potential formalism of @xcite to the superfluid case .",
    "however , due to numerical difficulties they could not study rotating models near the break - up limit . neither did they manage to determine the superfluid modes .    in this work",
    ", we study the time evolution of perturbed fast rotating , newtonian superfluid neutron stars within the cowling approximation .",
    "as far as we are aware , this is the first study that evolves in time the oscillations of superfluid neutron stars .",
    "moreover , it is the first detailed analysis of the rapid rotation regime . within the framework of the two - fluid formalism ,",
    "we carry out a linear perturbation analysis for stationary and axisymmetric equilibrium configurations . as preparation for more detailed studies ,",
    "we consider relatively simple models where the two fluids coexist throughout the star , and where the unperturbed configuration is in @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "these assumptions imply that the two fluids are co - rotating and share the same external stellar surface in our background configurations .",
    "we use these models to investigate the effects of entrainment , symmetry energy and rotation on the superfluid oscillation spectrum . in order to establish the reliability of our numerical evolution code",
    ", we compare our results to previous work for non - rotating and slowly rotating models .",
    "we then consider , for the first time , the dynamics of superfluid models rotating up to the mass shedding limit .",
    "we use the two - fluid framework for superfluid neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "this model distinguishes between a superfluid neutron component and a neutral mixture of protons and electrons .",
    "the charged particles are assumed to be locked together by the electromagnetic interaction on a timescale much shorter than the dynamics we consider . for simplicity",
    ", we refer to the charged particle conglomerate as the `` protons '' from now on . when the mass of each component is conserved the dynamics is described by two mass conservation laws , two euler - type equations and the poisson equation for the gravitational potential  @xcite : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 here the indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 label the spatial components of the vectors while @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the two fluid components .",
    "the constituent indices take the values @xmath17 for the neutrons and @xmath18 for the protons .",
    "note that the summation rule for repeated indices applies only for spatial and not for constituent indices . in equations  ( [ eq :",
    "mcon])([eq : poisson ] ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the total mass density and the gravitational potential , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath21 is the force density acting on the @xmath15 fluid component . in this work",
    ", we consider an isolated system where dissipation processes , like mutual friction , are absent .",
    "we then have @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that the particle masses are equal , @xmath23 , and defined the chemical potential and the relative velocity between the two fluids as follows : @xmath24 the energy functional @xmath25 describes the equation of state  ( eos ) of the system .",
    "finally , the non - dissipative entrainment between the two fluids is governed by the parameter @xmath26 , which follows from the definition : @xmath27    the equations that describe rapidly and uniformly rotating background models can be derived by integrating the euler - type equations  ( [ eq : euler ] ) and the poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson ] )  .",
    "this leads to @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the angular velocities and the integration constants for the neutron and proton fluids . in this work ,",
    "we focus on corotating background models , @xmath31 , where the two fluids are in @xmath0-equilibrium and have a common surface . the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( [ eq : bgmu_x ] )",
    "then become @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the background chemical potential and @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth noticing that equations  ( [ eq : poisson ] ) and  ( [ eq : bg1 ] ) are formally equivalent to the single fluid problem provided one replaces the chemical potential with the enthalpy  @xcite . given an equation of state , equations  ( [ eq : poisson ] ) and  ( [ eq : bg1 ] ) can be numerically solved using the self - consistent field method of  @xcite .",
    "the surface of the star corresponds to the zero chemical potential surface , @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "it is straighforward to write down the system of partial differential equations that governs the eulerian perturbations @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "instead of working with these variables , we define  ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) new variables which are more closely related to the natural degrees of freedom of the problem . in the rotating frame ,",
    "the co - moving ( ordinary ) motion is described by the mass flux @xmath38 ( not to be confused with the mutual force @xmath21 ) , the total mass density @xmath39 and the pressure @xmath40 , defined by @xmath41 meanwhile , the counter - moving ( superfluid ) motion is described by a vector field @xmath42 that is proportional to the relative velocity between the two fluids , the scalar perturbation @xmath43 that measures the deviation from @xmath0-equilibrium and the quantity @xmath44 , which is related to the perturbed proton fraction .",
    "these variables are defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the proton fraction .    in order to simplify the evolutions ,",
    "we neglect the perturbations of the gravitational potential @xmath47 .",
    "that is , we adopt the cowling approximation",
    ". this approximation should be quite accurate for inertial modes . for low order acoustic modes , like the f - mode",
    ", it is not so accurate but the results are still qualitatively correct . for our present purposes",
    ", this should be sufficent .",
    "although , it would not be too difficult to solve also for the perturbed gravitational potential it is computationally costly to add the solution of an elliptic equation to our evolutions .",
    "hence , we decided not to solve the full problem in this first exploratory study .    in the frame of the rotating background the final perturbation equations can be written @xmath48 where we have defined @xmath49 .",
    "the time evolution of the non - axisymmetric perturbation equations is a three - dimensional problem in space .",
    "however , linear perturbations on an axisymmetric background can be expanded in terms of a set of basis functions @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the azimuthal harmonic index  @xcite .",
    "the mass density perturbations as well as the other perturbation quantities take the following form  @xcite @xmath52 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : drhoexp}\\ ] ] the perturbation equations now decouple with respect to @xmath51 and the problem becomes two - dimensional .",
    "therefore for any @xmath51 , the non - axisymmetric oscillations of a superfluid neutron star requires the solution of a system of eighteen partial differential equations for the twenty variables @xmath53 . to fully specify the problem , the set of equations  ( [ eq : dfdt])-([eq : dchipdt ] )",
    "must be complemented by two relations that depend on the eos ( see section  [ sec : eos ] ) .      in order to evolve the perturbation equations",

    "we can derive a simpler condition for the pressure perturbation . from the euler equation for the stationary background ( noting that ( [ eq : def - dp ] ) holds also at the unperturbed level ) @xmath62 and",
    "the fact that the eos used in this work are such that the total mass density vanishes at the surface , it follows that equation  ( [ eq : dp - bc ] ) is equivalent to  @xcite : @xmath63 this condition is numerically convenient , and ensures that all variables remain regular at the surface .",
    "the reflection symmetry with respect to the equator divides the perturbation variables into two sets  @xcite .",
    "perturbations of the type  i parity class have @xmath64 even and @xmath65 odd .",
    "the opposite is true for perturbations of type ii .",
    "to complete the formulation of the superfluid oscillation problem we need to supply a suitable multi - parameter equation of state . in a truly realistic model , the equation of state",
    "should be obtained from a microscopic ( quantum ) analysis .",
    "it will completely specify not only the relation between pressure and density , but also the composition and the detailed superfluid energy gaps for neutrons and protons .",
    "moreover , it has to also provide the entrainment parameters .",
    "we do not yet have such a model , although recent developments in this direction are promising  @xcite . given this , and the fact that our main aim is to understand the oscillations of a rotating superfluid neutron star at the qualitative level",

    "these models , described in sections  [ sec : bgeos_1 ] and  [ sec : bgeos_2 ] below , are natural generalisations of the single fluid polytropes .",
    "the analytical models are particularly useful since they allow us to tune key parameters like entrainment and symmetry energy more or less freely .",
