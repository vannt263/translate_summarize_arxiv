    "the two - point correlator function of a classical dynamical system can be illustrated as a double sum over periodic orbits @xmath0 where @xmath1 abbreviates the average over the energy and over a small time window , @xmath2 denotes the heisenberg time and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the amplitude , the action , and the period of the orbit @xmath6 , respectively . as one is interested in the semiclassical limit @xmath7",
    ", it is expected that only orbit pairs @xmath8 such that @xmath9 or small .",
    "formulated in more mathematical terms , for a classical chaotic dynamical system the problem is to determine the periodic orbit pairs @xmath10 such that @xmath4 is close to @xmath11 , and then calculate .",
    "this was first considered by sieber and richter @xcite who predicted that a given periodic orbit with a small - angle self - crossing in configuration space will admit a partner orbit with almost the same action .",
    "the original orbit and its partner are called a sieber - richter pair . in phase space ,",
    "a sieber - richter pair contains a region where two stretches of each orbit are almost mutually time - reversed and one addresses this region as a _ @xmath12-encounter _ or , more strictly , a _ @xmath12-antiparallel encounter _ ; the ` 2 ' stands for two orbit stretches which are close in configuration space , and ` antiparallel ' means that the two stretches have opposite directions .",
    "the accuracy of sieber / richter s prediction was completely proven by huynh / kunze in @xcite . in that paper",
    "the authors considered the geodesic flow on compact factors of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a @xmath13-periodic orbit of the geodesic flow crossing itself in configuration space at a time @xmath14 has @xmath15-partner orbit and the action difference between them is approximately equal @xmath16 with the estimated error @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the crossing angle .",
    "periodic orbits with @xmath19-parallel encounters was investigated by mller et al . in @xcite .",
    "we speak of an _ @xmath19-encounter _ when @xmath19 stretches of a periodic orbit are mutually close to each other up to time reversal .",
    "in other words , all the @xmath19 stretches must intersect a small poincar section .",
    "mller et al . used combinatorics to count the number of partner orbits and provided an approximation for the action difference , but a construction of partner orbits and an error bound of the approximation had not been derived .",
    "then , huynh @xcite continued considering the hyperbolic dynamical system in @xcite to deal with the technically more involved higher - order encounters .",
    "the author proved that a given periodic orbit including an @xmath19-parallel encounter has @xmath20 partner orbits , constructed partner orbits and gave estimates for the action differences between orbit pairs .",
    "furthermore , mathematical definitions for ` encounters ' , ` partner orbits ' , etc . were also arrived in @xcite .    in the case of @xmath19-antiparallel encounter with general @xmath19 ,",
    "the problem is a very complicated and it is still open . in this paper , we only consider the problem for @xmath21 .",
    "we prove that a periodic orbit with @xmath12-antiparallel encounter has a partner orbit .",
