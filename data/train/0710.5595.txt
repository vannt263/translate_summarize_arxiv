    "the unilac at the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) produced its first heavy - ion beam in 1975 .",
    "today , the current gsi facility can provide quasi - continuous or pulsed beams of ions with practically any charge state , ranging up to u@xmath0 , with kinetic energies of several mev or gev per nucleon .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows schematically the present gsi accelerator facility .",
    "the ions are produced by penning , electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) and metal vapour vacuum arc ( mevva ) ion sources , and are then accelerated by a linear accelerator ( unilac ) , which is roughly 120 meters long , to the first range of kinetic energies , _",
    "i.e. _ up to several mev / u .",
    "after the first acceleration stage , the ions can be delivered to a series of low - energy experiments .",
    "one example is shiptrap , its name originating from the ship velocity filter that was used to discover six new elements : @xmath1bh ( bohrium , 1981 ) , @xmath2hs ( hassium , 1984 ) , @xmath3mt ( meitnerium , 1982 ) , @xmath4ds ( darmstadtium , 1994 ) , @xmath5rg ( rntgenium , 1994 ) , and @xmath6uub ( ununbium , 1996 ) .",
    "shiptrap is used to perform high - precision mass measurements of trapped ( unstable ) radionuclides with a relative mass uncertainty of @xmath7 .    in the heavy - ion synchrotron sis the ions are accelerated to kinetic energies of up to 2 gev per nucleon for atomic and nuclear physics experiments as well as heavy - ion tumor therapy .",
    "when using highly charged ions , ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) conditions are crucial in order to avoid charge changing collisions . in the unilac , where the ions charge states are not yet very high , pressures of around @xmath8 mbar are sufficient .",
    "however , in the heavy - ion synchrotron sis ( 216 m circumference ) and in the experimental storage ring esr ( 108 m circumference ) , for which the charge states are increased by shooting the highly - energetic ions through a stripper foil , the pressure is in the @xmath9 mbar regime .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig1 ] , the new trapping facility will be inserted into the re - injection channel between the esr and the sis .",
    "the new facility will broaden the current research field and open up several new ones , as indicated by the list in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the combination of high charge states and very low kinetic energies makes it possible to ( re)trap the ions in penning traps , where the ions themselves can be studied with high precision , or to collide them with gases and surfaces , in order to study their interaction with neutral matter @xcite .        in order to prepare the hitrap facility itself as well as the different experimental set - ups to be used at the hitrap facility with low - energy highly charged ions ,",
    "the hitrap rtd network was created , which was funded from 2001 through 2005 by the european union .",
    "within this project , there were different teams ( nine in total ) from different countries , each team preparing an experiment , ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , or providing theory .",
    "the goal of the hitrap network was _ the development of novel instrumentation for a broad spectrum of physics experiments with heavy highly charged ions ( up to u@xmath0 ) at low energies ( @xmath10 ev / u)_. within this project , instrumentation was developed for high - precision measurements of atomic and nuclear properties , mass and @xmath11-factor measurements , and ion - gas and ion - surface interaction studies .    the construction of the hitrap facility , which is being carried out in close collaboration between the gsi divisions for infrastructure , accelerators and atomic physics and the institute for applied physics at the university of frankfurt , started in the beginning of 2005 when appropriate funds were available .",
    "commissioning of the hitrap facility is planned for the first half of 2008 so that the experimental teams can start to perform their experiments in the second half of 2008 .    .participating teams in the hitrap eu rtd network .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    because the hitrap facility will not be able to continuously obtain the esr beam for testing the cooler trap and the experimental setups , it was decided to install an electron beam ion source ( ebis ) , which was available from the university of frankfurt , on the platform for off - line tests .",
    "this source ( maxebis ) is currently being tested and will be used to tune the low - energy beam line ( lebt ) towards the cooler trap , and for tests of the cooler trap itself . afterwards , the components will be moved to the hitrap facility . a more complete overview of the time planning for the construction of the hitrap facility is presented in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "since this publication is dedicated to ingvar lindgren on the occasion of his 75@xmath12 birthday , out of the many experiments becoming possible ( see inset of figure  [ fig2 ] ) , we discuss here only those which are very close to the heart of ingvar lindgren .",
    "these are the g - factor of the bound electron , the hyperfine structure , and the precision mass measurements .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy is discussed in a publication by t. sthlker",

    "quantum electrodynamics plays a dominant role , and the progress in atomic theory is essential .",
    "-factor versus nuclear charge @xmath13 . for heavy ions ,",
    "the situation is more difficult , but also more interesting , since the qed and nuclear size contributions become comparable.,width=226 ]      the precise measurement of the @xmath11-factor of the electron bound in a hydrogen - like ion is a sensitive test of bound - state qed at high fields .",
    "highly charged ions are ideal for such studies , because the electromagnetic fields existing close to the nucleus are much higher than those which can be created artificially in a laboratory .",
    "for example , the electric field strength close to the nucleus of u@xmath14 is of the order of @xmath15 v / cm , which is higher than those created by the strongest lasers available . at such high electromagnetic fields , perturbative qed calculations are no longer accurate , and",
    "higher - order terms need to be evaluated carefully .",
    "unfortunately , in this regime there is little or no experimental data to compare the non - perturbative codes to .",
    "this is precisely why @xmath11-factor experiments are important .    in relativistic dirac theory ,",
    "the @xmath11-factor of an electron bound to a h - like ion is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath13 is the nuclear charge and @xmath17 the fine structure constant .",
    "the ratio of the bound - electron ( @xmath18 ) to the free - electron @xmath11-factor ( @xmath19 ) can be expressed , to leading order in @xmath20 , as @xmath21    the first two terms in eq .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) it is clear that for @xmath13 larger or equal to @xmath22 , @xmath11 is undefined .",
    "already when @xmath23 is no longer valid , non - perturbative calculations have to be performed @xcite .",
    "corresponding first calculations were initiated by i. lindgren and g. soff .",
    "-factor measurements of the bound electron.,width=264 ]    the @xmath11-factor of the bound electron in @xmath24c@xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26o@xmath27 @xcite has been obtained via spin - flip measurements of a single cold ( 4 k ) ion .",
    "the setup was constructed in a gsi - mainz collaboration , and consists of two penning traps @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ a ` precision trap ' and an ` analysis trap ' , placed in one superconducting magnet .",
    "a schematic of the trap is shown in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the @xmath11-factor can be obtained from measurements of the cyclotron frequency @xmath28 and the larmor frequency @xmath29 , since it can be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mass and charge of the electron and the ion , respectively . using high - quality resonant circuits ,",
    "the oscillation frequencies of an ion inside a penning trap can be measured independently and with high accuracy . for these measurements ,",
    "the polarisation of the electron spin is 100% , because only one ion is used .",
    "the cyclotron frequency @xmath33 is determined inside the precision trap , and a spin - flip may be induced by microwave irradiation at a frequency close to the larmor frequency @xmath34 .",
    "detection of a spin - flip takes place after transporting the ion to the analysis trap . here",
    ", a significant inhomogeneity of the magnetic field , produced by a nickel ring , makes the @xmath35-motion of the ion sensitive to the spin direction .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath35-motion is detected via electronic detection ( based on image charges ) .",
    "after analyzing the spin direction , the ion is transported back to the precision trap for the next measurement cycle .",

    "the horizontal axis shows the ratio of the microwave frequency @xmath36 to the cyclotron frequency @xmath33 , from which the @xmath11-factor of the bound electron can be obtained .",
    "the experimental @xmath11-factors of the hydrogen - like ions @xmath24c@xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26o@xmath27 @xcite agree within the uncertainties , which are dominated by the accuracy of the electron mass , with the calculated values @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-factor of the @xmath37 electron thus enabled a test of bound - state qed at a level of 0.25% .",
    "accurate @xmath11-factor measurements also provide means to obtain better values for fundamental constants , such as the fine structure constant @xmath17 ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "for example , because of the good agreement with theory , the @xmath11-factor data led to a determination of the electron mass with a four times higher accuracy @xcite .",
    "the relative experimental accuracy @xmath38 of this measurement was as good as @xmath39 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) it can be seen that the @xmath11-factor is linked to @xmath17 , and it can easily be shown that the relative uncertainty in @xmath17 is correlated to that in @xmath11 via @xmath40 it is therefore most interesting to measure @xmath11 at the highest possible @xmath13 . succeeding the measurements in @xmath24c@xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26o@xmath27 @xcite , a measurement of the electronic @xmath11-factor in @xmath41ca@xmath42 @xcite is currently being prepared .",
    "when hitrap is operational , similar experiments on heavy systems like @xmath43u@xmath14 will be performed .",
    "it is expected that , from such a measurement , @xmath17 ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) can be obtained with an accuracy of @xmath44 @xcite . a combination of such measurements in h - like and b - like heavy ions can increase this accuracy significantly @xcite .",
    ": the evolution of the different measurements and their accuracies during the last 20 years is indicated.,width=321 ]      masses of stable or radioactive nuclides can be measured with very high accuracy and single - ion sensitivity , using penning traps @xcite . since the cyclotron frequency of a trapped ion increases with the charge state ,",
    "highly charged ions provide better resolution and potentially also higher accuracy than singly charged ions .",
    "the smiletrap group in stockholm has pioneered the use of highly charged ions in ion traps for mass spectrometry @xcite .",
    "they measured the masses of several ions , which are important for tests of qed or double - beta decay , with an uncertainty close to @xmath45 . using the mass of @xmath24c@xmath46 , van dyck _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in seattle measured the masses of stable singly charged ions with an accuracy of about @xmath45 .",
    "a similar accuracy was obtained for the proton - antiproton comparison at cern , measured by the group of gabrielse @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite at mit even had a mass spectrometer , which is now at florida state university @xcite , with an accuracy of about @xmath9 .",
    "the masses of singly charged radionuclides have been measured with an accuracy of @xmath47 to @xmath44 and better , by penning trap mass spectrometers installed at isolde / cern @xcite , argonne @xcite , jyvskyl @xcite , msu @xcite , and gsi @xcite .",
    "highly charged ions for mass spectrometry will be used at titan at isac / triumf , vancouver @xcite , lebit / msu @xcite , hitrap / gsi @xcite , isoltrap / isolde @xcite , mafftrap / munich @xcite , and at mats / gsi @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] shows a comparison between a mass measurement in a penning trap with a singly charged ion , and one with a highly charged ion .",
    "the numbers show that , for the same isotope , an ion with a charge of @xmath48 already leads to an improved mass resolution of nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "longer observation times ( for example , @xmath49 s ) and higher charge states ( _ i.e. _ @xmath50 for uranium ) can further improve the mass resolution . in principle , a mass measurement accuracy of @xmath9 or better can be reached .",
    "this would , for example , make it possible to ` weigh ' the @xmath37 lamb shift in u@xmath14 with an accuracy better than presently possible by x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 & @xmath52 mhz + @xmath53 s & @xmath54 hz + @xmath55 & @xmath7 +   + @xmath48 & @xmath56 mhz + @xmath53 s & @xmath54 hz + @xmath57 & @xmath58 +    [ tab3 ]      an experiment is being prepared to perform laser spectroscopy of ground state hyperfine structure in highly charged ions @xcite .",
    "normally , the hyperfine splitting wavelength in atoms and ions is in the microwave region .",
    "however , since the hyperfine splitting of hydrogen - like ions scales with the nuclear charge as @xmath59 , the hyperfine structure becomes measurable by laser spectroscopy above @xmath60 .",
    "this allows for accurate laser spectroscopy measurements of these hyperfine splittings and , in turn , for sensitive tests of corresponding calculations of transition energies and lifetimes .",
    "previous measurements were carried out for @xmath61 @xcite , @xmath62 @xcite , @xmath63 @xcite , @xmath64 @xcite , @xmath65 @xcite and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "these measurements suffered from the doppler width and shift of the transition , which were due to the relativistic velocities and velocity spreads of the ions in the esr . in the case of the measurements conducted in the ebit ( electron beam ion trap ) at livermore ,",
    "resonance transitions were broadened due to the high temperatures of the ions in the ebit .",
    "the new experiments will be performed in a penning trap with confined and cold highly charged ions at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "this strongly reduces the doppler effects and will lead to a measurement resolution of the order of @xmath47 .",
    "hence , these results will allow the determination of hyperfine anomalies which requires high precision .",
    "the trapped ions will be laser - excited along the trap axis , and fluorescence detection will take place perpendicular to the trap axis , through the transparent ring electrode ( see figure  [ fig10 ] ) .        furthermore , by use of a rotating wall technique @xcite , which radially compresses the ion cloud via a rotating dipole field applied to the segmented ring electrode , a high ion number density can be obtained .",
    "together with the localisation , this enhances the intensity of the measured fluorescence . for an ion cloud of @xmath67 highly charged ions at the space charge limit of the trap , we calculated fluorescence rates of several thousand counts per second on a background of a few hundred counts per second ( s / n @xmath68 50 ) @xcite .",
    "laser intensities of several tens of w / m@xmath69 are required to saturate the 10 mm@xmath69 ion cloud , which implies moderate laser powers of just a few mw @xcite .",
    "furthermore , measurements of hyperfine structure in h- and li - like ions can test quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) at high electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "such accurate measurements can be compared to corresponding calculations that include nuclear effects , such as the bohr - weisskopf and breit - schawlow effects , as well as ( higher - order ) qed effects . from a comparison of the hyperfine splitting in h- and li - like ions of the same isotope ,",
    "the nuclear effects cancel to a large extent , thus enabling a stringent test of the qed effects @xcite .",
    "the necessary experimental resolution for such a comparison is of the order of @xmath8 , which can relatively easily be met by laser spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in the more distant future , hitrap will be a component of the new international facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) @xcite .",
    "hitrap will thus , in addition to highly charged and radioactive ions , also produce low - energy antiprotons . furthermore , the fair facility will provide the highest intensities of both stable and radioactive ion beams with energies up to 34 gev per nucleon . at such energies ,",
    "the highly charged ions generate electric and magnetic fields of exceptional strength and ultra - short duration .",
    "the general layout of fair is shown in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "the new fair facility has key features that offer a range of new opportunities in atomic physics research and related fields , which will be exploited by the stored particle atomic research collaboration sparc @xcite .",
    "in particular , the superconducting fragment separator ( sfrs ) will provide a rich spectrum of radionuclides .",
    "the high intensity of secondary beams produced at the sfrs will make it possible to extract decelerated radioactive ion beams from the new experimental storage ring ( nesr ) and to decelerate them for trap experiments with sufficient intensity at hitrap .",
    "therefore , the physics program of hitrap can be extended to novel experiments with trapped radioactive ions and , of course , with trapped antiprotons .",
    "trapped radioactive ions in high charge states may reveal a completely new domain for fundamental interaction studies and for experiments on the borderline between atomic and nuclear physics .",
    "moreover , the manipulation of trapped radioactive ions with laser light opens up possibilities to study questions of the standard model . by optical pumping within the hyperfine levels of the ground state ,",
    "the nuclear spins of radioactive nuclides can be polarized with high efficiency .",
    "the detection of the asymmetry of beta decay , for example , will allow one to explore deviations from the vector / axial - vector ( va)-structure of the weak interaction and to set limits for the masses of heavy bosons , which are not included in the standard model .",
    "direct mass measurements on unstable nuclides with ultra - high accuracy ( up to @xmath70 ) will also be possible .",
    "such an accuracy would allow one to determine the binding energy of u@xmath14 with an accuracy of @xmath71 .",
    "if the qed calculations are found to be correct , nuclear charge radii of unstable nuclides can be determined .    for a general exploration of masses in the chart of nuclei , a mass resolution of @xmath72 to @xmath47",
    "is sufficient .",
    "this is also planned by isochronous or schottky mass spectrometry experiments at the new experimental storage ring ( nesr ) . however , in some cases , like double - beta decay or tests of the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , a much higher accuracy is required , which is possible by using trapped highly charged ions at hitrap @xcite and at mats @xcite",
    ".      the planned flair facility will be the most intense source of low - energy antiprotons world - wide @xcite .",
    "the beam intensity of extracted low - energy antiprotons will be two orders of magnitude higher than that of the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) at cern .",
    "we therefore anticipate that experiments with trapped antiprotons , which are currently impossible anywhere else ( due to insufficient intensities ) , will be performed at the flair facility .",
    "a possible highlight in the field of low - energy antimatter research would be the first direct experimental investigation of the gravitational interaction of antimatter , which has never been attempted up to now .",
    "such investigations could be performed on ultra - cold antihydrogen atoms @xcite which are produced by recombining trapped antiprotons with positrons in a so - called nested penning trap .",
    "the effect of gravity on antimatter is an important issue for the development of quantum theories of gravity .",
