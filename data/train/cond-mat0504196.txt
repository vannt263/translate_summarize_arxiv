    "( in what follows , we use terminology appropriate to microwave experiments . )",
    "beginning with the case of zero loss ( @xmath46 ) , we have that , in the goe case , the impedance matrix @xmath1 is described by the following statistical model @xcite , @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the wave number corresponding to the incoming frequency , @xmath49 is a vector whose elements are real , independent , zero mean , gaussian random variables of unit variance .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath50 are randomly chosen with statistics appropriate to goe .",
    "this is done by generating ensembles of eigenvalues of random matrices and then scaling them such that the mean spacing between adjacent eigenvalues near @xmath50 is @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath52 is given by the weyl formula for the mean eigenvalue spacing .",
    "for example , for the case of a 2d cavity @xmath52 is independent of @xmath48 , @xmath53 where @xmath26 is the area of the cavity .",
    "the system - dependent part of the coupling is characterized by the corresponding radiation impedance matrix @xmath54 .",
    "note also that , since @xmath55 depends only on local geometry near the entrances to the scattering region , its frequency dependence is much slower than that of @xmath1 which depends on the geometry of the scattering region assumed to be characterized by much longer length scales .",
    "the radiation impedance is the impedance seen at the reference plane of the input channel when waves that leave the channel propagate outward and are not reflected back to their input by the distant walls of the cavity .",
    "thus the radiation impedance is the impedance seen when the distant walls are removed to infinity , or ( as can be done in an experimental measurement @xcite ) when the distant walls are lined with absorber .",
    "hence the radiation impedance depends only on the local structure in the vicinity of the port coupling to the cavity and not on the shape or chaotic properties of the cavity . in the case of ports that are far apart ,",
    "e.g. , of the order of the cavity size , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath55 are small and will be neglected .",
    "thus we will take @xmath55 to be a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath56 . in the gue case ,",
    "the elements of @xmath49 in ( [ eq : zcav_paper2 ] ) are complex with real and imaginary parts each individually having gaussian statistics , @xmath57 in ( [ eq : zcav_paper2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 denotes the conjugate transpose ) , and the statistics of @xmath50 are now those appropriate to gue .",
    "equation ( [ eq : zcav_paper2 ] ) is derived in @xcite .",
    "it results from a formal series expansion of the solution for @xmath1 in terms of eigenfunctions of the closed cavity .",
    "the local structure of the eigenfunctions is then assumed to satisfy the so - called `` random plane wave hypothesis '' ; namely , that in the semi - classical limit ( @xmath60 is large compared to the typical dimensions of the structure ) , if ray trajectories in the closed cavity are chaotic , then eigenfunction @xmath61 is statistically similar to a random isotropic superposition of plane waves of wave number @xmath62 with magnitude@xmath63 .",
    "this gives eq .",
    "( [ eq : zcav_paper2 ] ) @xcite",

    "the universality of the result for @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1 ) can be shown from ( [ eq : zcav_paper2 ] ) as follows .",
    "the impedance matrix @xmath1 defined in ( [ eq : zcav_paper2 ] ) will have a mean and a fluctuating component .",
    "as shown in refs @xcite , the value of the mean is determined by all terms in the sum and thus depends on the slow @xmath48-dependence of @xmath65 and @xmath52 , while the fluctuating component of @xmath1 is determined by terms in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zcav_paper2 ] ) for which @xmath66 .",
    "thus if @xmath67 and @xmath51 are approximately constant over a range of @xmath50 values corresponding to many resonances , then the fluctuating part of @xmath1 will be universal after appropriate normalization .",
    "if we define @xmath68 to be the fluctuating part of @xmath1 , we have @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the eigenvalues of a goe random matrix , normalized to have unit mean spacing between adjacent eigenvalues near @xmath71 .",
    "thus @xmath72 is a universal normalized impedance matrix .",
    "if @xmath55 is diagonal , we have @xmath73 .",
    "hence the ratios @xmath2 defined by ( [ eq : vrz ] ) is the same for @xmath1 and @xmath72 , and is , therefore , universal .",
    "( we emphasize , however , that this conclusion relies on @xmath55 being diagonal . )    the effects of distributed loss , such as losses due to conducting walls or a lossy dielectric that fills the cavity , can be simply incorporated in eq .",
