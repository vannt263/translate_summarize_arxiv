    "two - dimensional condensed matters such as graphene @xmath6 and monolayer molybdenum disulfide ( ml - mds ) @xmath7 including dirac - like charge carriers can present itself as capable structures to observe distinct transport properties resulted from andreev reflection ( ar ) and klein transmission . by the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk @xmath8 formalism , the peculiar andreev process results in a finite conductance in a normal / superconductor junction at the electron excitations below the superconducting gap @xmath4 . another interesting feature of ar has been proposed by beenakker @xmath9 as specular ar , when a n / s proximity junction is realized in graphene , where an electron from the conduction band is reflected as a hole in the valence band , in which the reflection angle is inverted with respect to the incidence .",
    "this can be controlled by the bias voltage ( electron excitation ) dependence of the subgap andreev conductance .",
    "recently , the ar was studied at the interface of ml - mds superconductor / normal metal @xmath10 , where the authors show the p / n - doping effect ( the magnitude of the chemical potential in the normal region relative to superconductor region ) on the retro ar .",
    "this may gain more attention , since charge carriers exhibit either electron - like or hole - like quasiparticles belonging to two inequivalent nondegenerate @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys . comparing with graphene , such attention for ml - mds",
    "is highlighted by some distinct features of @xmath0 : i ) existence of direct band - gap in low - energy band structure in the visible frequency rang ( @xmath11 ) , ii ) strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) resulted from heavy metal atoms , iii ) breaking the valley degeneracy with a valley - contrasting spin splitting ( @xmath12 ) caused by inversion symmetry breaking @xmath13 . in this paper , firstly we , in particular , investigate the explicit dependence of andreev process on the electron incidence angle in the f / s and n / s junctions by determining the allowed chemical potential of ferromagnetic or normal region due to the significant spin - splitting of the valence band in @xmath0 . to do this ,",
    "we obtain the explicit expression of the ml - mds superconducting electron - hole excitations and corresponding fermi wavevectors , which enables us to find the exact and appropriate form of dirac - bogoliubov - de gennes ( dbdg ) spinors .",
    "we show that these spinors are fundamentally different from those obtained in the previous works @xmath14 , so that we are allowed to consider the difference of superconducting gap under electron - hole converting , taking place in the @xmath5-wave superconductivity @xmath15 . secondly , we focus on the f / s structure , because of the exchange splitting energy @xmath16 of f metal may induce a large spin - splitting of @xmath2 valley in the valence band , which results in a novel behavior of pseudo - relativistic klein tunneling giving rise to a tunneling conductance difference between spin - up and spin - down carriers and resulting magnetoresistance @xmath17 .",
    "the same structure with graphene was studied in @xmath18",
    ".    however , proximity - induced superconductivity and ferromagnetism in the @xmath0 can be experimentally achieved @xmath19 .",
    "recently , the physics of spin and valley coupling @xmath20 and ferromagnetic / superconductor / ferromagnetic @xmath21 junction have been studied in the ml - mds structures .",
    "further , the contribution of schrodinger - like terms ( topological and difference mass between electron and hole terms ) @xmath22 are taken into account to the dirac - like one - particle superconductor excitations .",
    "moreover , we investigate the effect of anisotropic @xmath5-wave pairing energy gap @xmath23 in the hamiltonian of ml - mds and the resulting ar , because the sign of pair potential @xmath24 may be changed by electron - hole conversion . this leads to form the zero - energy states in the similar josephson junction @xmath25 and corresponding zero - bias andreev conductance .",
    "obtained by us superconducting wavefunctions allow to explicitly exert this feature in the quasiparticle states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 is devoted to present the proposed model and formalism to obtain the exact form of @xmath0 superconducting dispersion energy and corresponding spinors .",
    "the normal and andreev reflection coefficients are found by matching the wavefunctions at the interface .",
    "the numerical results of ar and resulting tunneling conductance considering the strong spin - valley effect caused by ferromagnetic exchange field and also asymmetric superconducting order are presented , and their main characteristics are discussed in sections 3 and 4 . finally , we close with a brief summary in sec",
    "a typical @xmath26 structure on top of a ml - mds sheet is introduced with the configuration that the ferromagnetic and superconductor regions are extended from @xmath27 to @xmath28 and from @xmath28 to @xmath29 for all @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the low - energy band structure of ml - mds can be described by the modified dirac hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian in addition to the first order term of momentum for 2d massive fermions , contains the quadratic terms originated from the difference between electron and hole masses @xmath31 and also , topological characteristics @xmath32 .",
    "the strong spin - orbit coupling leads to distinct spin splitting at the valence band for different valleys . in the presence of an exchange field @xmath16 and superconducting gap induced by proximity effect , the dirac - bogoliubov - de gennes ( dbdg )",
    "hamiltonian is given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the spin - up and spin - down is labeled by @xmath36 , and valley index @xmath37 denotes the @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys .",
    "the bare electron mass is @xmath38 , and topological and mass difference band parameters are evaluated by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 is the direct band gap , @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the spin - orbit coupling and fermi velocity , respectively .",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath44 gives the relative shift of fermi energy in @xmath45 and @xmath46 regions .",
    "the superconducting gap is presented by @xmath4 , which in the @xmath5-wave order parameter case , as mentioned in the previous section it is parameterized by the electron incidence angle ( with respect to the perpendicular direction to the interface ) @xmath47 in s region and orbital rotated angle @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "taking the superconducting gap to be zero in f region and from the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the excitation energy ( relative to the fermi energy @xmath49 ) can be obtained as below : @xmath50 the electrostatic potential @xmath44 is determined to be zero in this region .",
    "fermi energy is determined by the magnitude of the chemical potential . as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the valence and conduction bands are characterized by two branches @xmath51 of the spectrum .",
    "filled circle indicates the electron excitations , while empty circle denotes the hole excitations .",
    "the corresponding fermi wavevector in ferromagnetic @xmath0 can be acquired from this eigenstates : @xmath52 where we define @xmath53 .",
    "the electron and hole excitations are indicated with states above and below the fermi level , respectively . for @xmath54 , the exchange field and electrostatic potential",
    "are taken to be zero and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "note that the mean - field conditions are satisfied as long as @xmath56 .",
    "the dispersion relation of dbdg for electron - hole excitations is given by solving the energy - momentum quartic equation , as follows : @xmath57 the wavevector and fermi energy of superconducting quasiparticles are defined by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the schematic of the above ml - mds superconducting dispersion is shown in fig .",
    "we observe that the dispersion energy is strongly sensitive to fermi energy for small values of wavevectors . for excitations below the superconducting gap there are no propagating waves in the superconductor .",

    "the incidence and reflected quasiparticle wavefunctions in the f section can be described by : @xmath62 @xmath63 where we define @xmath64 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath65 ensure that the particle current density of states is the same .",
    "the charge and current density of quasiparticles may be defined by nonrelativistic and relativistic terms based on the lorentz covariant continuity equation . using the modified dirac hamiltonian , continuity equation results in : @xmath66=0.\\ ] ] hence",
    ", the normalization factor is given by : @xmath67    inside the superconducting region , the solutions of the dbdg equation take the following more simple and accurate form : @xmath68 where the parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be expressed as : @xmath72^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath73 the coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspond to the transmission of electron and hole , respectively . by the subgap tunneling condition @xmath76 ,",
    "the amplitude of the electron - hole conversion @xmath61 and electron - electron normal reflection @xmath60 can be found by the boundary condition at the interface between f and s regions : @xmath77,\\ ] ] @xmath78 - 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 @xmath80 finally , the tunneling conductance @xmath81 passing through the @xmath26 ( or @xmath82 , for the exchange field @xmath16 being zero ) junction can now be calculated in terms of normal and andreev reflection coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the ballistic conductance of spin and valley - dependent transverse modes @xmath85 in a sheet of @xmath86 of width @xmath87 that @xmath88 denotes the bias voltage .",
    "the upper limit of integration in eq .",
    "( 10 ) needs to obtain exactly based on the fact that the incidence angle of electron - hole in the two regions must be less than @xmath89 , where we find the critical angle @xmath90 to take place the actual andreev reflection .",
    "first we consider the scattering process in n / s junction ( no ferromagnetic exchange field @xmath91 ) on top of ml - mds to obtain precisely the reflection of charge carriers versus incidence angle to the interface , since we may fix the range of chemical potential to remain in the valence band of either normal or ferromagnetic section .",
    "it confirms that the subgap transmission of electrons with excitations below the superconducting gap is forbidden ( note that , @xmath92 ) .",
    "we know that at the normal incidence , the andreev reflection happens with unit probability in dirac materials . in fig .",
    "2 , obviously , andreev and normal reflections of eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) versus incidence angle are demonstrated . the spin - valley polarized andreev reflection for incident electron from the left normal region with spin @xmath93 from valley",
    "@xmath94 extremely depends on the fermi level of valence band .",
    "therefore , our calculations should be done under the condition that the fermi energy of normal section satisfies the relation @xmath95 .",
    "the magnitude of fermi energy in this structure is determined by the incident electron from @xmath1 valley with spin - down @xmath96 . as expected ,",
    "the pure symmetric reflection curves of andreev and normal are found .",
    "considering the doping of superconducting section reveals that for both @xmath97 and @xmath98-doped cases , the electron - hole conversion happens with most efficiency at normal incidence .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "2 that the ar amplitude decreases slowly and goes to zero at @xmath99 for @xmath97-doped case , while in @xmath98-doped case the ar curve behaves as decreasing for smaller incidence angles .",
    "we obtain the unit ar at the normal incidence for @xmath97-doped case , which is not observed in the previous work @xmath10 . as long as the condition @xmath100 is satisfied",
    ", the magnitude of fermi energy in normal section affects the probability of ar .",
    "accordingly , we plot the @xmath101 dependence of ar in fig . 3 for different values of fermi energy of normal section .",
    "3 , by increasing the absolute fermi energy via chemical potential we can increase the ar probability .",
    "it is interesting that the electron - hole conversion with unit probability happens at maximum value of allowed absolute fermi energy of normal segment .    in the next step ,",
    "we investigate how the asymmetric @xmath5-wave superconducting gap can affect fundamentally the reflections behavior , which is shown in fig .",
    "4 . in this case , the magnitude of ar decreases comparing with those in the @xmath93-wave .",
    "this is a consequence of angular averaging in the unconventional pairing symmetry .",
    "importantly , relative to the superconducting orbital rotated angle @xmath102 $ ] , the ar suddenly falls for a specific incidence angle .",
    "so , the behavior of the andreev reflection is not a uniform curve in the presence of @xmath5-wave pairing potential .",
    "an interesting aspect is when an f metal is included in normal section .",
    "it is notable that in presence of exchange field @xmath103 , spin - splitting of valence band of @xmath0 strongly depends on the valley index . as the result ,",
    "an extra momentum change between andreev reflected electron and hole occurs , and actually it leads to decrease the amplitude of ar . by increasing the induced exchange field ,",
    "the separation between spin subbands decreases in @xmath1 valley , and reaches to zero for @xmath104 , whereas increases in @xmath2 valley .",
    "consequently , it needs to define the fermi energy ( chemical potential ) in the f / s structure .",
    "since , there are two inequivalent valleys in ml - mds , we have four critical fermi energy for different spin subbabnds of two valleys as ( @xmath105 ) , ( @xmath106 ) , ( @xmath107 ) and ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "actually , the spin - valley polarized andreev reflection occurs when we have such condition as @xmath109 .",
    "thus , similar to n / s structure , ar probability increases by increasing the absolute fermi energy .",
    "furthermore , only the incoming spin up quasiparticle from @xmath1 valley can be reflected as a hole state with opposite spin and different valley index .",
    "otherwise , there is no longer a hole state in the f region , and andreev process is suppressed . in the numerical results ,",
    "the exchange field is taken in units of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath110 .",
    "the resulting zero bias andreev and normal reflections curves are presented in figs .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) for two different magnitudes of exchange filed .",
    "the results of @xmath93-wave order parameter are displayed in fig .",
    "it is shown that under the effect of exchange energy , the ar amplitude decreases .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath5-wave superconducting gap it declines impressively .",
    "we now turn to a study of the tunneling conductance in the ml - mds @xmath82 and @xmath26 structures . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) as long as we have @xmath111 , the andreev reflected hole is in the valence band , and ar may be retro . from fig .",
    "6 , it can be seen that the magnitude of subgap andreev conductance versus bias voltage is sensitive to femi energy . depending on the magnitude of gate voltage ,",
    "the enhanced conductance can occur for subgap bias voltages .",
    "it is shown that the zero bias conductance increases with fermi energy of superconductor section @xmath112 .",
    "also , increasing the ar probability with @xmath49 leads to the increasing the resulting andreev conductance .",
    "this behavior can be exactly explained in the framework of the andreev process occurring in the previous section . in order to explain the behavior of the andreev conductance for different superconducting gap",
    ", we demonstrate the fermi energy dependence of the andreev conductance , see fig .",
    "7 . as a result ,",
    "the conductance - fermi energy relation for the @xmath93-wave and anisotropic @xmath5-wave is qualitatively the same , although its magnitude is reduced in @xmath5-wave gap , which is related to the effective weakening of the gap upon fermi surface averaging of its absolute value compared to the @xmath93-wave . as shown in fig .",
    "7 , for larger mismatch between electron and hole wavevectors , the difference between conductances of various order parameters is obvious .",
    "finally , we investigate how the magnetization of f region can affect the andreev conductance .",
    "the incoming quasiparticle from the f region can include various combinations of valley and spin indices .",
    "it is noticeable that only the incident electron with spin - up from valley @xmath1 can be reflected as hole . for other quasiparticles ,",
    "the ar process is suppressed .",
    "accordingly , the andreev conductance in ferromagnetic structure is significantly decreased .",
    "the behavior of zero bias conductance versus bias voltage for three different values of exchange field is presented in fig .",
    "8 . as seen from figs . 5 , in presence of exchange field the probability of ar diminishes in zero bias .",
    "so , the resulting andreev conductance decreases with @xmath16 .",
    "we find that the exchange energy can decline the subgap andreev conductance in @xmath86-based @xmath26 junction in contrast to the graphene - based junction .",
    "in summary , the andreev process and transport characteristics of monolayer @xmath0 @xmath26 junction have been studied . using the modified dirac hamiltonian , that in addition to the first order term of momentum contains the quadratic terms corresponding to the topological and difference mass between electron and hole terms , we have given the explicit form of electron - hole superconducting excitations and resulting dirac spinors .",
    "relative to the effective spin - orbit coupling strongly appeared in valence band of ferromagnetic ml - mds , the allowed values of chemical potential in order to have subgap conductance have been fixed .",
    "note that , the andreev reflection of an incidence electron from the left ferromagnetic region with spin number @xmath93 from valley @xmath94 extremely depends on its fermi level in the valence band .",
    "we have found the ar to exhibit a new behavior with respect to the ferromagnetic exchange field and superconducting order parameter .",
    "in particular , the unit value of ar for normal incidence has been obtained in both @xmath97- and @xmath98-doped superconductor @xmath0 . using the obtained compact form of superconducting states",
    ", we have investigated the role of singlet anisotropic superconducting gap in the andreev process and resulting subgap conductance .",
    "considering the dynamical feature of monolayer @xmath0 , the andreev - klein transmission between inequivalent valleys can happen only in the valence band , and resulting retro ar gives rise to decline the valley - resolved andreev conductance in the presence of exchange field .",
    "finally , the anisotropic @xmath5-wave superconducting gap causes the breaking of ar curve , and resulting zero bias conductance enhances with increasing the absolute of fermi energy controlled by the spin - valley polarized ar .",
