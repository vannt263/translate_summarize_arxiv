    "inference for graphical models is a topic of contemporary interest , and in this regard , various tools for inference have been proposed in the statistics literature , including establishing sufficient and/or necessary conditions for existence of high dimensional estimators .",
    "one important contribution in the area are the families of type i and type ii graphical wishart distributions introduced by letac and massam ( lm ) @xcite .",
    "the families of graphical wishart type distributions of letac - massam have the distinct advantage of being standard conjugate for gaussian graphical models , have attractive hyper markov properties , and have multiple shape parameters .",
    "this is in contrast with the classical wishart distribution which has just one shape parameter that is restricted to the one dimensional gindikin set - see .",
    "these multi - parameter graphical wishart distributions are therefore useful for flexible high dimensional inference @xcite , and have also been used as flat conjugate priors for objective bayesian inference . since the domain of integrability of these high dimensional priors are not fully identified , it is not clear when these distributions yield proper priors .",
    "the lm conjecture aims to address this question formally .",
    "the lm conjecture is also critical for understanding when these priors lead to well - defined bayes estimators , since this is not always guaranteed in high dimensional , sample starved settings . in this sense resolving the lm conjecture",
    "can be viewed as a bayesian analogue of the frequentist problem of identifying sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of the maximum likelihood estimator for gaussian graphical models .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is therefore to resolve a conjecture of letac and massam ( henceforth the lm conjecture ) which concerns identifying the parameter sets for the families of the so - called type i and type ii wishart distributions .",
    "a definitive solution to the lm conjecture has remained elusive to the graphical models community ever since it was formally posed by letac and massam about ten years ago .",
    "the conjecture also has deep and profound connections to gindikin s result @xcite on the region of integrability of the p - variate gamma function .",
    "this domain is referred to as the gindikin set and is given as follows : @xmath0    though the main goal of this paper is to resolve the lm conjecture , we note that understanding the domain of integrability of these graphical wishart distributions is important for two other reasons beyond bayesian inference and model selection : 1 ) these two classes of distributions also serve as statistical models in their own right for matrix - variate distributions defined on sparse subsets of the cone , and 2 ) the integrals of these graphical wishart densities are extensions of the gamma and multivariate gamma functions on sparse manifolds . thus understanding the domains of integrability of these graphical wishart distributions is of independent mathematical interest that is closely linked to generalizations of the gindikin set .    in what follows",
    "we shall employ the notation introduced in the work of letac and massam @xcite .",
    "the type i wishart and type ii wishart are defined , respectively , on the cones @xmath1 and @xmath2 associated with a decomposable graph @xmath3 , i.e. , an undirected graph that that has no induced cycle of length greater than or equal to four .",
    "these cones naturally arise as the set of covariance and inverse - covariance parameters for a gaussian undirected graph model over @xmath3 .",
    "i.e. , the family of multivariate gaussian distributions that obey the pairwise or global markov property with respect to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that if the vertices of @xmath3 are labeled @xmath4 , then a p - variate gaussian distribution @xmath5 obeys the global markov property with respect to @xmath3 if @xmath6 whenever there exists no edge between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this property gives a simple characterization of the associated inverse - covariance matrices , i.e. , the elements of the cone @xmath2 .",
    "the cone @xmath1 is the dual cone of @xmath2 and its elements are incomplete covariance matrices where only the entries along the edges of @xmath3 are specified , and the rest of the entries are unspecified .",
    "however , the specified entries are also the only functionally independent entries of the covariance matrix parameter , and uniquely determine the rest of the entries ( the unspecified entries that is ) .",
    "in particular , the space of covariance matrices for the gaussian inverse - covariance graph model over @xmath3 can be identified with the cone @xmath9 . when @xmath3 is complete , i.e. , in the full model , type i and type ii wishart distributions are identical to the classical wishart distribution .",
    "moreover by restricting the multi - parameters to a specific one dimensional space , these distributions reduce to the hyper wishart distribution introduced by dawid and lauritzen @xcite and the g - wishart defined by roverato in @xcite respectively ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "although having multiple shape parameters allow the type i wishart and type ii wishart distributions to be more flexible as prior distributions , there is a trade - off : the sets of multi - parameters are not completely identified .    in an attempt to identify the set of multi - parameterss of the type i wisharts , denoted by @xmath10 , and that of type ii wisharts , denoted by @xmath11 , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.3 ) letac and massam first consider the case when @xmath3 is homogeneous , i.e. , @xmath3 is decomposable and has no induced paths of length greater than or equal to 4 . when @xmath3 is homogeneous letac and massam are able to completely identify @xmath10 and @xmath11 and , furthermore , give algebraic expressions for the elements of both sets . if @xmath3 is non - homogeneous , however , in (",
    "* section 3.4 ) the authors are able to only partially identify the sets @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "more specifically , for each perfect order @xmath12 of @xmath3 , they identify a subset @xmath13 of @xmath10 and a subset @xmath14 of @xmath11 .",
    "the authors then proceed to conjecture that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are indeed the union of @xmath13 and @xmath14 over all perfect orders of the cliques of @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "they demonstrate that the conjecture holds when @xmath3 is the 4-path , the simplest non - homogeneous decomposable graph , @xmath16 .",
    "they note that a similar calculation for the 5-path appears insurmountable .    on a different route , but motivated by the recent work of letac and massam @xcite and rajaratnam et al .",
    "@xcite for concentration graph models , and khare and rajaratnam @xcite for covariance graph models , the authors of this paper undertook a parallel analysis in @xcite for directed acyclic graph models , abbreviated dag models , or bayesian networks . in @xcite",
    ", we introduce a new class of multi - parameter wishart type distributions , useful for bayesian inference for gaussian dag models .",
    "one of its advantages is that the framework in @xcite applies to all directed acyclic graph models and not just the narrower class of perfect dags .",
    "furthermore the normalizing constant for these dag wisharts is available in closed form for all dags .",
    "it is also well - known fact that the family of inverse - covariance graph model over a decomposable graph @xmath3 is markov equivalent to the family of dag models over a perfect dag version of @xmath3 . as we shall demonstrate later , this , in particular",
    ", implies that both the type ii wisharts of letac - massam in @xcite and the dag wisharts in @xcite are indeed defined on the same cone @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , a relevant question is how the functional form and the multi - parameter set of the type ii wishart density compare with those of the dag wishart .",
    "a similar comparison arises between the type i wisharts of letac - massam and the riez distributions for decomposable graphs introduced by andersson and klein in @xcite .",
    "such comparisons shed light on the lm conjecture since the domains of integrability of the dag wisharts are fully specified in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop tools which allows a careful comparison of these two types of wisharts on @xmath2 and @xmath1 , leading to counterexamples , which in turn can then be used to conclude that the lm conjecture does not hold in general .",
    "the primary key to resolving the part of the lm conjecture that concerns the type ii wishart is theorem [ thm : comparison ] of this paper . in this theorem",
    "we show that for any non - homogeneous decomposable graph @xmath15 there exists a perfect order @xmath17 and a perfect dag version of @xmath15 , associated with this order , such that the type ii wishart distribution on @xmath14 is a special case of the dag wishart distribution . using this observation , and depending on the perfect dag version of the underlying graph @xmath3",
    ", we derive a condition in proposition [ prop : b1 ] , which when satisfied , can lead to counterexamples to the lm conjecture .",
    "we then proceed to present two graphs ( with their respective perfect dag versions ) where the stated condition in proposition [ prop : b1 ] is satisfied and lead to counterexamples to the lm conjecture .",
    "the counterexample to the other part of the lm conjecture concerning the type i wishart distribution is given after proposition [ prop : a1 ] where we prove that the same condition as that in proposition [ prop : b1 ] can lead to resolving the lm conjecture .",
    "in addition to disproving the lm conjecture , we also prove that not only for non - homogeneous decomposable graphs , but also for homogeneous graphs , the family of type ii wisharts are a subclass of the family of dag wisharts .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  [",
    "sec : pre ] we recall some fundamental notation and concepts in graphical models and , in particular , for gaussian undirected graphical models . in ",

    "the main results of the paper are presented in the ensuing four sections . in ",
    "[ sub : comparison_non_hom ] and  [ sub : typeii_dag_wish_hom ] , we develop tools which enable a detailed comparison between type ii wisharts on one hand , and on the other hand , dag wisharts for the corresponding dag versions of the associated undirected graphs .",
    "moreover , tools are developed for comparisons of both decomposable and homogeneous type ii wisharts to their dag wishart counterparts . using the tools developed in ",

    "then @xmath474 for every @xmath475 such that @xmath476 now we show that for each @xmath153 that satisfies equation , not only equation is satisfied , but also equation is satisfied , i.e. , @xmath477 by equation and equation we have @xmath478 now similar to our computation in equation we can show @xmath479 therefore , we have @xmath480 this completes our first counterexample .",
    "[ ex : lm2_b ] let @xmath3 be the non - homogeneous graph given in [ fig : c2 ] and let @xmath62 be the dag given in [ fig : cd2 ] .",
    "one can readily check that @xmath62 is a dag version of @xmath3 induced by @xmath481 since there are @xmath472 cliques and @xmath255 separators @xmath482 and @xmath483 .",
    "therefore , the lm conjecture ( ii ) here implies that the dimension of @xmath11 is @xmath484 .",
    "now @xmath468 as the separators @xmath485 and @xmath486 are ancestral ( two other separators @xmath487 and @xmath488 are not ancestral ) . therefore , by proposition [ prop : b1 ] , equation is satisfied on a set of dimension greater than or equal to @xmath489 . we leave it to the reader to show that with a similar calculation as in example [ ex : lm2_a ] equation is satisfied on this set .",
    "thus the lm conjecture ( ii ) fails .",
    "note that in example [ ex : lm2_b ] the separator @xmath490 . therefore @xmath491 . by some calculations similar to those of example [ ex : lm2_a ]",
    ", we can show that the markov ratio present in the corresponding type ii wishart is @xmath492 where the exponents @xmath493 and @xmath224 are some linear functions of @xmath494 and @xmath495 . now using equation",
    "one can show that both equation and equation are satisfied for every @xmath496 subject to the constraint @xmath497 .",
    "this shows that the dimension of @xmath498 . on the other hand",
    ", we can see that for any dag version of @xmath3 always two of the separators will be be non - ancestral .",
    "therefore , although proposition [ prop : b1 ] identifies a subset of @xmath11 that is strictly larger than the subset identified by the lm conjecture ( ii ) it does not identify the whole set @xmath11 , since for any dag version of @xmath3 proposition [ prop : b1 ] will identify a subset of dimension @xmath499 .",
    "in this section we once more use the theory we had developed in previous sections to produce counterexample to part ( i ) of the lm conjecture .",
    "first we establish the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : mr ] suppose that @xmath62 is a perfect dag version of @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath500    we shall proceed by the method of mathematical induction .",
    "suppose this is true for any decomposable graph with number of vertices less than @xmath92 and we prove the lemma for @xmath189 .",
    "the equality trivially holds when @xmath501 .",
    "let us therefore assume that @xmath502 .",
    "as before , let @xmath503 be the number of the cliques and consider the following cases .",
    "* suppose that @xmath504 , i.e. , @xmath3 is complete .",
    "we write @xmath505 where the last equality uses the induction hypothesis for the induced graph @xmath506 . *",
    "suppose that @xmath507 .",
    "note that by lemma [ lem : combine ] we can assume that @xmath62 is induced by some perfect order @xmath285 . in particular , there exists a vertex in @xmath316 that has no child .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , assume that the vertices in @xmath62 are labeled such that @xmath508 .",
    "we now consider two cases : +  a )   if the residual @xmath509 , then @xmath510 and @xmath511 are , respectively , a perfect order of the cliques and a perfect dag version of @xmath512 . moreover , @xmath513 .",
    "now it follows that @xmath514  b )   if the residual @xmath316 has more than one element , then @xmath515 is a perfect order of the cliques of @xmath512 with associated separators @xmath516 . using the induction hypothesis",
    "we obtain @xmath517    the markov ratio in the right - hand - side of the equation is the squared root of the jacobian of the inverse mapping @xmath518 .",
    "it can be shown directly that the left - hand - side of the equation is also is the squared root of the jacobian of the inverse mapping @xmath519 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ we illustrate the result of lemma [ lem : mr ] for the decomposable graph @xmath3 and its perfect dag version @xmath62 given in figure [ fig : c1 ] and figure [ fig : cd1 ] , respectively .    by using the same perfect order of @xmath17 as in example [ ex :",
    "lm2_a ] the corresponding markov ratio becomes @xmath520    next we use lemma [ lem : mr ] to prove an analog of proposition [ prop : b1 ] for the letac - massam type i wisharts .",
    "[ prop : a1 ] let @xmath3 be a non - complete ( decomposable ) graph . assume that @xmath62 is a dag version of @xmath3 induced by @xmath17 such that @xmath290 is ancestral .",
    "let @xmath381 and @xmath383 be as those defined in definition [ def : ans ] .",
    "then the dimension of the set of @xmath141 that satisfies equation is greater than or equal to @xmath384 .    first note that by lemma [ lem : combine ] assuming the existence of a such @xmath62 is not vacuous .",
    "now using lemma [ lem : mr ] , we begin with rewriting the density of the type i wishart to obtain an expression in terms of relationships in the directed version @xmath62 .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "@xmath521 recall that in the proof of theorem [ thm : comparison ] it was showed that @xmath522 , @xmath523 for @xmath524 , and @xmath525 for each @xmath385 can be written as products of @xmath526 raised to some powers .",
    "now define @xmath527 clearly , for each @xmath528 the expression in equation reduces to @xmath529 where @xmath530 is an affine combination of the components of @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "the expression in equation is the non - normalized version of the density of the generalized riesz distribution on @xmath531 , defined in @xcite , and is integrable , by equation ( 18 ) in @xcite , if and only if @xmath532 for each @xmath533 .",
    "an important observation in proposition [ prop : a1 ] is that if @xmath3 is chosen such that @xmath389 , then part ( i ) of the lm conjecture may fail .",
    "in fact we can show that the same decomposable graphs given in figure [ fig : c1 ] and figure [ fig : c2 ] provide two counterexamples to part ( i ) of the lm conjecture .",
    "since the calculations are very similar , we provide details only for the second graph .",
    "+    consider the graph @xmath3 given in figure [ fig : c2 ] and its dag version given in figure [ fig : cd2 ] .",
    "note that the lm conjecture ( i ) implies that the dimension of the parameter set @xmath10 is @xmath484 since @xmath482 .",
    "now @xmath62 is induced by @xmath534 .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "@xmath535 let @xmath536 be the exponent of @xmath269 in equation for each @xmath537 .",
    "if we set @xmath538 , then we obtain @xmath539 the integrand in the right - hand - side of equation corresponds to the non - normalized density of the generalized riesz distribution on @xmath540 and has a finite integral if and only if @xmath541 for each @xmath537 . furthermore , under these conditions , we have @xmath542 see @xcite for details . on the other hand , by very similar calculations as those which lead to equation we can show that @xmath543 therefore , from equation , for any @xmath153 satisfying @xmath544 and @xmath538 we conclude that @xmath545 consequently , the dimension of @xmath10 is greater than or equal to @xmath546 . thus the lm conjecture ( i ) fails .",
    "in this paper we develop appropriate tools in order to carefully compare the wishart type ii distributions introduced by letac and massam in @xcite for decomposable graphs and the dag wisharts introduced by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the comparison is made when the dag wisharts are restricted to the class of perfect dags , that is where dags are markov equivalent to the class of decomposable graphs . by this comparison ,",
    "we establish the fact that in general , the family of type ii wisharts is a subfamily of that of dag wisharts when the multi - parameters are restricted to a well identified set @xmath14 . in case of homogeneous graphs we show that the latter restriction is not needed . in light of this result",
    "we are led to a condition on the structure of the graphs that yield counterexamples to the second part the lm conjecture . by taking a similar approach we are also able to reject the first part of the lm conjecture and",
    "therefore completely resolve the lm conjecture ."
