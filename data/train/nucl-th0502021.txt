    "three- and four - nucleon systems are the testing ground for studying the nuclear interaction .",
    "if modern nn potentials have reached a very high degree of accuracy in describing the two - nucleon data , they fail already to account for the binding energies of the lightest nuclei .",
    "the use of three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) is  with some exceptions @xcite  mandatory . by adjusting its parameters one can obtain a satisfactory description of nuclear binding energies up to a=10 @xcite .    apart the effect of rescaling nuclear thresholds , low energy three - nucleon scattering observables are quite insensitive to 3nf .",
    "furthermore , since 3n spectra does not contain any narrow resonances , three - nucleon dynamics is relatively rigid once deuteron and triton binding energies are fixed .",
    "the four nucleon continuum is a challenging few - body nuclear problem .",
    "its interest lies not only in the natural progression that it represents , towards a systematic description of nuclear systems with increasing complexity , but also in the richness of the @xmath1 nuclear chart itself ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_n4_en_chart ] ) .",
    "four nucleon problem , we believe , implies a qualitative jump in respect to the @xmath2 case .",
    "we use the faddeev - yakubovski ( fy ) equations in configuration space to tackle the four - particle problem .",
    "however in their original form these equations are applicable only for systems interacting via short - range pairwise forces . an elegant way to include 3nf into fy equations",
    "was suggested in @xcite for four identical particles .",
    "these equations reads : @xmath3 + v_{12,3}\\psi \\nonumber \\\\ \\left ( e - h_{0}-v_{12}\\right ) h_{12}^{34 } & = & v_{12}\\tilde{p}\\left [ ( 1+q)k_{12,3}^{4}+h_{12}^{34}\\right]\\label{fy1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 being permutation operators : @xmath8 and @xmath9 q(1+p^{+}+p^{-})k_{12,3}^{4}+(1+p^{+}+p^{-})(1+\\tilde{p})h_{12}^{34}\\ ] ] the total wave function .",
    "equation ( [ fy1 ] ) becomes however non appropriate once long range interaction , in particular coulomb , is present .",
    "in fact , fy components remain coupled even in far asymptotics , thus making the implementation of correct boundary conditions hardly possible . in order to circumvent this problem",
    "we have split coulomb potential ( @xmath10 ) into long ( @xmath11 ) and short ( @xmath12 ) range parts by means of some arbitrary cut - off function @xmath13 , similarly as it was done by merkuriev for 3-body equations @xcite : @xmath14 v_{c}(x)$\\end{tabular}\\ ] ] @xmath13 is a smooth function which equals 1 for small @xmath15 values or when @xmath16 and vanishes for @xmath17 then the 4-body fy equations can be rewritten in the form :    @xmath18+v_{12,3}\\psi \\nonumber \\\\ ( e - h_{0}-v_{12}^{(sh)}-\\sum v_{c}^{(l)})h_{12}^{34}&=&v_{12}^{(sh)}\\tilde{p}\\left [ ( 1+q)k_{12,3}^{4}+h_{12}^{34}\\right]\\label{mfy_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we use for short the following notations : @xmath19    in this form fy equations become assymptoticaly uncoupled and appropriate boundary conditions can be easily implemented .",
    "equations ( [ mfy_eq ] ) are solved by making partial wave decomposition of amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 :    @xmath22   \\\\ h_{i}(\\vec{x}_{i},\\vec{y}_{i},\\vec{z}_{i } ) & = & \\sum_{lst}\\frac{\\mathcal{h}_{i}^{lst}(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})}{x_{i}y_{i}z_{i}}\\left [ l(\\hat{x}_{i},\\hat{y}_{i},\\hat{z}_{i})\\otimes s_{i}\\otimes t_{i}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the partial components @xmath23 and @xmath24are expanded in the basis of three - dimensional splines .",
    "thus integro - differential equation ( [ mfy_eq ] ) is converted into system of linear equations . for detailed discussion on the equations and method used",
    "one can refer to @xcite .",
    "the elastic scattering of neutrons on tritium is the simplest 4n reaction .",
    "treatment of this system does nt require calculation of the costly integrals due to the coulomb terms in eq .",
    "( [ mfy_eq ] ) .",
    "nevertheless this system contains two , spin degenerated , narrow resonances at low energy ( @xmath25 mev ) .",
    "ability of nuclear interaction models to describe scattering cross sections in this resonance region is still an open question @xcite .",
    "semi - realistic mt i - iii potential was shown to be very successful in describing total as well as differential cross sections @xcite at the energies bellow",
    "n - n - d threshold .",
    "situation is less obvious for realistic potentials , which require much larger partial wave basis ( pwb ) to obtain converged results .",
    "recently we have managed to considerably enlarge our pwb compared to @xcite . despite of having some effect on the negative parity phase shifts , the total cross section near the resonance peak ( @xmath26 @xmath27 ) has not been improved ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_nt_total_cs ] ) .",
    "we should notice , however , that the @xmath28 phase shifts , the most relevant due to its statistical factor , are not fully converged yet .",
    "they still show some trend to increase , however we estimate that it can not suffice to reproduce the experimental data .    by including uix-3nf",
    "we have managed to reproduce the experimental zero - energy cross sections ( see table [ table:1 ] ) , which are overestimated by realistic nn interaction without 3nf .",
    "however their effect near the peak remains very small .",
    "other smaller discrepancy exists near the minima of total cross sections ( @xmath29 ) . in this region , determined by positive parity states , both mt i - iii and av.18+uix overestimate experimental data .",
    "this suggest that low energy parameters ( 0@xmath30 and 1@xmath30 scattering lengths and effective ranges ) are not described sufficiently well .",
    "this system is an isospin partner of n-@xmath0h . yet",
    "calculations were done uniquely with mt i - iii model , except of @xmath31 scattering lengths for which our av.18 and av.18+uix predictions agree very well with the results of pisa group @xcite . like in the n-@xmath32h case , mt i - iii was found to be successful in describing differential cross sections up to d+p+p threshold ( see fig . [ diff_cs_phe ] ) .",
    "@xmath33he continuum is the most complex 4n system , since its spectrum contains numerous resonances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_n4_en_chart ] ) .",
    "calculations of p+@xmath32h scattering are furthermore complicated by the existence of the first @xmath31 excitation of @xmath33he in its thresholds vicinity .",
    "this resonance located at @xmath34 @xmath27 above p+@xmath32h threshold covers with its width @xmath35 @xmath27 almost the entire region below n+@xmath32he . in order to separate n+@xmath32he and p+@xmath32h channels one should properly treat coulomb interaction , the task is being furthermore burden since both thresholds are described by the same isospin quantum numbers .",
    "when ignoring coulomb interaction , as was a case in the most of the calculations performed until now , n+@xmath32he and p+@xmath32h thresholds coincide .",
    "@xmath36 resonant state moves below the joint threshold and becomes a bound state for all nn potentials models we use .",
    "former fact is reflected in low energy scattering observables : on one hand n+nnn scattering length in @xmath36 state is found positive , on the other hand excitation function decreases smoothly with incident particles energy and does not show any resonant behavior .    by properly taking coulomb interaction into account , thus separating n+@xmath32he and p+@xmath32h thresholds , we have placed the @xmath37he virtual state in between .",
    "however unlike in the other 4n systems , mt i - iii predictions for p-@xmath32h singlet ( @xmath31 ) scattering length as well as the excitation function ",
    "@xmath38  are in disagreement with experimental data . in this model",
    "@xmath37he virtual state is obtained too close to the p-@xmath32h threshold and therefore has very small width . nevertheless out of resonance region the excitation function approaches experimental data points , which is not a case in the calculations without coulomb interaction considered .",
    "our calculations with realistic potentials are still limited in pwb .",
    "nevertheless , they provide very promising results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_pt_cross_av ] .",
    "pure 2nf models predict too large singlet scattering length , thus placing the virtual state too far from threshold . on the other hand , by implementing uix-3nf in conjunction with av.18 nn model one obtains singlet scattering length as well as the excitation function @xmath38 in agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of these calculations is in progress @xcite as well as their extension above the n-3he threshold .",
