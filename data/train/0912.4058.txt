    "the state of the molecular rydberg electron is determined by both long - range attraction to its parent ion as well as the short - range interaction with the nearby ground state atom .",
    "this vast length scale disparity poses considerable problems for current quantum chemistry approaches , which can be elegantly resolved through fermi s pseudopotential approximation @xcite .",
    "we first apply the born - oppenheimer approximation and a single - active particle treatment of the excited electron to obtain the following hamiltonian ( in atomic units ) @xmath1 of the molecular rydberg electron . here , @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the unperturbed rydberg atom , whose center is located at @xmath3 , and where the molecular axis @xmath3 also defines the quantization axis .",
    "@xmath4 accounts for the interaction of the rydberg electron with the perturbing ground state atom , which is described by a fermi - type pseudopotential for electron atom scattering @xcite , including the first two @xmath5 partial waves .    within the fermi model @xcite , the molecular interaction of low-@xmath6 rydberg states",
    "is commonly described by the simple first - order perturbative potential @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the unperturbed electronic rydberg wave function and @xmath9 is the energy dependent s(p)-wave scattering length .",
    "the electron momentum @xmath10 depends on the rydberg energy @xmath11 through the quasiclassical relation @xmath12 .",
    "this approach yields an intriguingly simple and intuitive description of the molecular interaction and is typically employed to describe molecules formed with energetically well isolated @xmath13 rydberg states @xcite . even for this case , however , eq.([fermi ] ) turns out to be inaccurate at the level of accuracy of the experimental data .",
    "hence , we performed non - perturbative green s function calculations @xcite of the molecular potentials ( see methods ) .",
    "as an example , we compare the calculated potential energy curves @xmath14 with the first - order perturbative potential @xmath15 for @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as is known for high-@xmath6 rydberg molecules , eq.([fermi ] ) fails in the vicinity of the p - wave shape resonance @xcite because the resonance leads to an avoided potential crossing .",
    "this curve crossing is crucial for determining the vibrational spectrum of the molecule found in our experiments .",
    "unexpectedly , @xmath17 also falls short of more accurate calculations around the outer potential well at @xmath18 .",
    "one can , nevertheless , obtain an approximate description of the strong molecular resonance , localized in the outermost minimum of the potential energy curve , by using an effective , properly adjusted s - wave scattering length @xmath19 with eq.([fermi ] ) ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding vibrational energy for all principal quantum numbers @xmath20 is well reproduced for an effective scattering length of @xmath21 . while this value is @xmath22 larger than the actual value of @xmath23 ( see sec .",
    "ii ) , it may serve as an effective parameter or characteristic of a given atomic species that yields the respective @xmath24-dependence of the strongest molecular resonance , based on the simple model potential eq.([fermi ] ) .",
    "to create the ultralong - range rydberg molecules , we prepare a cold sample of @xmath25 atoms in the ground state @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 rydberg state of principal quantum numbers , @xmath28 , is addressed by two narrow - band lasers ( see methods ) . the vibrational bound dimer and trimer states",
    "can be created directly via photoassociation if the detuning of the excitation light from the atomic rydberg state matches the molecular binding energy , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the molecular states appear in the spectra on the red side of the atomic rydberg line , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the uppermost graph ( a ) shows the full @xmath30 spectrum which consists of two atomic states @xmath31 and @xmath32 , separated by the zeeman splitting @xmath33 in the magnetic trap , and several molecular lines . due to the spin polarization in the magnetic trap @xmath34 , only the molecular triplet states",
    "are excited .",
    "the atomic state @xmath36 and the molecular state @xmath37 have the same zeeman shift ( see inset ) and thus the binding energy @xmath29 can be directly measured as the energy difference between the corresponding lines in the spectrum .",
    "note that in our previous work @xcite the binding energies @xmath29 were defined differently .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b)-(d ) show the @xmath38 to @xmath39 spectra at high resolution .",
    "after field ionization , we observe both an atomic ion signal corresponding to @xmath40 and a molecular ion signal corresponding to @xmath41 which can be clearly identified in the time - of - flight spectra .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 spectra predominantly show the same features but with different intensity distributions .",
    "a few deep bound states exclusively appear in the rb@xmath42 spectrum , but can be assigned as dimer states by our theoretical model .",
    "the fact that the strengths of the two ion signals are comparable for the molecular states is a clear indication that @xmath41 is the product of an additional decay that occurs for the molecular states . to obtain maximum spectral information",

    "[ tab1 ] ) are indicated by vertical lines . ]    to assign the observed lines based on the described potential calculations , we employ the ab - initio data of @xcite for the s - wave scattering phaseshift @xmath45 .",
    "since the available p - wave scattering data @xcite does not yield an accurate description of the measured spectra , we use the modified effective range expression @xcite for the corresponding phaseshift @xmath46 .",
    "this three - parameter fitting procedure allows the assignment of most of the observed lines and reproduces the resonance frequencies with a remarkable accuracy .",
    "the results of the calculation are included in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and compared to the measurements in tab .",
    "the strongest molecular line , labeled by @xmath47 , in each spectrum corresponds to the dimer state localized in the outermost potential well ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) which was assigned as vibrational ground state @xmath48 in @xcite .",
    "the present study allows to identify several additional lines as excited dimer states .",
    "in particular , the theory predicts a state which is even deeper bound than the state in the outermost potential well , @xmath47 .",
    "this state is localized around @xmath49 for 35s ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and is assigned in the measured spectra .",
    "in addition to the dimer lines , we observe two resonances at deeper binding energy in the experiment .",
    "the lowest one systematically appears at twice the binding energy of the outermost localized dimer state @xmath47 .",
    "our green s function calculations show that for such large internuclear separations , the binding energy for two simultaneously bound ground state atoms is approximately given by the sum of the two binding energies .",
    "this approximation is a result of the weak interaction between the ground state atoms and the large geometric phase space of the trimer molecule .",
    "the observed spectral feature provides clear evidence for the direct photoassociation of a long - range triatomic molecule @xcite , in which two ground state atoms are simultaneously bound to the rydberg atom via their interaction with the rydberg electron .",
    "the remaining unassigned lines may indicate that excited states of these exotic trimers are also formed in our experiments .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment confirms existing s - wave scattering data , predicting a zero energy s - wave scattering length of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the described fitting procedure allows to extract p - wave scattering parameters , and yields a zero energy scattering length of @xmath51 , which is well within the range of previous calculations .",
    "our extracted value for the shape resonance energy @xmath52 mev constitutes the first experimental determination of this quantity and agrees well with theoretical predictions @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "for a pure s - wave potential the outermost localized state @xmath53 , for @xmath16 at @xmath54mhz , constitutes the true vibrational ground state @xcite of the molecule .",
    "a more accurate determination of the molecular potential requires the inclusion of p - wave scattering and in particular the shape resonance in the p - wave scattering cross - section of rubidium @xcite has to be taken into account , which leads to an avoided crossing between adjacent molecular potential curves around @xmath55 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on the vibrational structure and results in additional molecular states that are delocalized over several @xmath56 with vibrational energy that lies above the potential maxima inside the attractive potential well .",
    "although energetically possible , these states have only negligible probability density at interatomic distances smaller than @xmath57 1000@xmath58 . as there exists no inner potential barrier that would facilitate a common molecular binding of these excited vibrational states , the binding has to arise from a fundamentally different mechanism .",
    "we show that molecular binding in this case originates from quantum reflection at the steep potential drop around @xmath55 .    due to the enormous potential drop and flat potential energy curve at the avoided crossing",
    ", the molecular wave function behaves in the inner region very much like that of a free particle with a relatively large kinetic energy compared to the outermost part of the potential curve .",
    "the large discontinuity leads to a dramatic change in kinetic energy over a small distance and the wavefunction is reflected at this point , similar to what happens at a large impedance mismatch in an electrical circuit , and the wavefunction piles up at large @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , the long - range molecular structure is largely unaffected by the details of the interaction at small distances , and inaccuracies in the shorter ranged energetically deeper parts of the interaction potential can safely be neglected .",
    "the small leakage into this region is treated as _ inward _ scattering - in analogy to standard _",
    "outward _ scattering problems - such that the molecular states can be obtained from a stabilization procedure @xcite .",
    "precisely , we place a reflecting boundary in the inner region of the potential well at @xmath60 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and record the energy eigenvalues as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "the observed energies are clearly visible in the resulting stabilization plot ( see fig.[fig3]a ) and appear as sharp maxima in the corresponding density of states ( see fig.[fig3]b ) .    within an alternative approach that underlines the crucial role of quantum reflection",
    ", we consider an outgoing plane wave injected at @xmath61 with an energy below the height of the innermost well .",
    "we study the complex reflection coefficient @xmath62 of reflection off the outer potential plateau at @xmath63 .",
    "the scattering phase @xmath64 can be related to the time delay @xmath65 between a scattered and a freely propagating particle @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) we show the phaseshift for the molecular curve of the @xmath16 rydberg state while its derivative is depicted by the right curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath66 exhibits a small background due to classical slow - down of the outgoing particle , moving up the potential hill . in perfect agreement with the calculated density of states ( left curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) we find an additional series of sharp resonances riding on top of this background .",
    "consequently , these resonances are of non - classical origin and mark the occurrence of a quasi - bound state .",
    "the resonance line shape is of breit - wigner type , and , according to wigner s time delay interpretation , yields the lifetime of the corresponding quasi - bound state , in this case the time the system spends in the innermost part of the potential well before penetrating into the outer part of the potential . adopting this to the vibrational states in the outer part , @xmath67 accords to the time the ground state atom spends in the outer region before entering the inner part of the potential .",
    "such quasi - bound states , occur , e.g. , in strong - field ionization of atoms and molecules @xcite and affect transport phenomena in multi - layered semiconductors @xcite , where localized states are confined inside a well by a high tunneling barrier .",
    "in contrast to these systems , the long - range vibrational states studied here arise nearly entirely from quantum reflection keeping the ground state atom outside the potential drop . to distinguish this purely quantum mechanics - based reflection from semiclassical phenomena , the spatial variation of the de broglie wavelength @xmath68}$ ] has to be considered @xcite .",
    "a a slow variation of @xmath69 defines the semiclassical region .",
    "depending on the vibrational energy , this condition is violated , i.e. @xmath70 , around the potential maxima in the outer plateau region .",
    "indeed the innermost of these badlands extends deep into the left of the sharp potential drop . to identify the dominant contributions of the molecular curve , we have adapted the method of @xcite to determine the reflection coefficient of the two inner potential maxima .",
    "we find , that even for the highest lying excited state for rb(35s ) , the reflection coefficient is a as high as @xmath71 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that these unique vibrational states arise from the special form of the interaction potential leading to quantum reflection near the deep abyss due to the avoided potential crossing that results from the p - wave scattering resonance .",
    "the remarkably good agreement between experiment and theory over a range of principal quantum numbers attests to the accuracy of fermi s original pseudopotential approach in describing interactions in highly excited multi - atom systems .",
    "a non - perturbative approach of these interactions is , however , necessary and leads to an unusual binding caused by internal quantum reflection .",
    "the latter is crucial for the existence of excited dimer states , since it prevents collapse to small interatomic distances , which would lead to fast decay of the molecule . since the molecular structure is found to be sensitive to the characteristics of both s - wave and p - wave scattering , long - range rydberg molecules are an accurate experimental platform to investigate electron - atom collision in a previously inaccessible ultralow - energy domain .",
    "the fact that these exotic molecules have huge bond length but nevertheless a vibrational spectrum with several states make a new type of ultracold rydberg chemistry feasible : larger polymers or even heteronuclear molecules can be realized , where the number of atoms , the constituent atomic elements and the addressed rydberg state allow for the precise selection of the properties of the long - range molecule .",
    "indeed , the three - body photoionization demonstrated in this work , may be regarded as an initiating step towards the production of larger and more complex polyatomic molecules . in particular",
    ", the high sensitivity of rydberg atoms to external fields provides an ideal starting point for coherent control and the investigation of molecular dynamics and reactions in a new regime .",
