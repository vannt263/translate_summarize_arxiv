    "the spin - orbit ( so ) interactions in semiconductor nanostructures are currently attracting much interest due to their central role in the characterization and control of spin properties of these systems @xcite .",
    "particular attention is devoted to the rashba interaction in two - dimensional quantum wells a so coupling stemming from the well inversion asymmetry in the growth direction whose intensity can be manipulated by electrical gating @xcite .",
    "the rashba interaction is also the underlying physical mechanism for the operation of the proposed spin transistor , one of the paradigms of spintronic device , exploiting the electron s spin to control the charge current between two ferromagnetic contacts @xcite .    in a quantum wire with _ uniform _ so interaction the energy subbands deviate from the simple parabolic behavior , with band splittings and anticrossings that yield a modified wire conductance and the possibility of spin - textured states @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider a wire with _ nonuniform _ rashba interaction , localized to a finite region acting as a spin scattering center ( a rashba dot ) that affects the wire conductance properties .",
    "it will be shown with numerical and analytical results that this geometry leads in a natural way to the appearance of fano resonance profiles in the energy dependence of the conductance that depend quite sensitively on the properties of the rashba dot , such as its dimensions and so intensity .",
    "we refer to this influence of the rashba so coupling on the wire conductance as the fano - rashba effect .",
    "fano resonances @xcite are a general phenomenon that has been observed in different fields , such as atomic physics @xcite , raman scattering @xcite and mesoscopic electron transport @xcite .",
    "fano - resonance physics appears wherever there is an interference between two paths , one corresponding to direct transmission and the other to the passage through a quasi - bound state lying nearby in energy . as a consequence ,",
    "characteristic asymmetric lineshapes appear in the most general case , with conductance dips in which transmission is greatly quenched .",
    "indeed , for the case of scattering centers that may be modelled as attractive potentials it was shown that an exact transmission zero should always be present @xcite . in our case of a rashba dot the existence of transmission zeros is not always guaranteed and only for some specific dimensions and intensities of so coupling the wire conductance vanishes at the dip position .    a useful theoretical framework to understand fano resonances is the coupled - channel model ( ccm ) . in this approach",
    "the wave function is approximated by the superposition of different channel components , each of them obeying an equation containing the channel background contribution and also the coupling with the other channels .",
    "we shall compare the prediction of ccm with the exact numerical solution obtained from a grid discretization of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the prediction of the ccm will be analyzed using the ansatz for the quasi - bound state channel proposed by nckel and stone @xcite , and also with a full numerical solution of the ccm equations . in this way",
    "we shall explicitly proof the validity of the ansatz .",
    "this analysis is an extension of our recent work @xcite and is also related to the study in ref .",

    "the inset to fig .",
    "1 shows a simple sketch of the physical system under consideration .",
    "we have obtained the linear conductance @xmath12 as a function of the electron energy ( fermi energy ) discretizing the @xmath13 plane in a uniform grid and using the quantum - transmitting - boundary algorithm @xcite .",
    "this method transforms the schrdinger equation into a complex linear system whose dimension is twice the number of grid points , due to the two spin components . in spite of the typically large dimension ,",
    "the system is highly sparse and it can be solved efficiently with standard numerical routines .",
    "this approach provides the exact wave function for the ballistic transport problem from which one obtains the transmission amplitudes and the wire s linear conductance .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical conductance curve for specific values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the usual staircase conductance is modified because of the rashba dot in two main aspects .",
    "first the initial part of the step is smoothed , a usual quantum behavior of scattering through potential wells .",
    "the second conspicuous feature is the existence of a pronounced conductance dip near the end of the conductance plateau .",
    "it was already mentioned that the existence of conductance dips is normally due to quasibound states . to proof it in the present context we show in fig .",
