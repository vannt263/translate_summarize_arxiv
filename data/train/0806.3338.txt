    "this work is devoted to the problem on a control of a nearly monochromatic weakly nonlinear dispersive wave with small amplitude in a strong nonlinear media .",
    "it is well - known that packets of nearly monochromatic waves propagate without changing of their shape when the envelope function of the packet is a soliton of the nonlinear schrdinger equation(nlse ) .",
    "the solitary packets of waves would be more suitable for communication in optical fibers on a large distance if one can control the parameters of the envelope function for such packets .",
    "the wave packets with a soliton - like shape form for sufficiently large range of initial data .",
    "the control of the shape is possible by a parametric perturbation of the system .",
    "here we propose a new approach for controlling of parameters of the solitary packets . in our approach",
    "the wave packets are controlled due to a slowly passage through a local parametric resonance .    in this paper",
    "we study the parametrically driven nonlinear klein - gordon equation .",
    "the frequency of the driver varies slowly .",
    "it is well - known that an envelope function of weak nonlinear wave is a solution of the nlse @xcite-@xcite . in general case this is valid proposition for the parametrically driven klein - gordon equation .",
    "but the small driving force plays a central role in narrow layers where the frequency passes through the resonant value . as a result",
    "fast and slow variables appear which define the behaviors of the solution . in these layers the envelope function of a primary parametric resonance equation instead of the nlse . in the slow variables the passage through the resonant layer looks as a jump of the envelope function .",

    "for parametric resonance the solution was studied in @xcite for the mathieu equation .",
    "they shown that the solution defines by parabolic cylinder functions . in our work",
    "we found that the parabolic cylinder equation also allows one to obtain the connection formulas for the small solutions of nonlinear klein - gordon equation .    in this work",
    "we use the singular perturbation theory and matching of different asymptotic expansions to obtain the connection formula .",
