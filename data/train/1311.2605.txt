    "the non - thermal radiation emitted in pulsar wind nebulae is commonly associated with ultra - relativistic electron - positron pairs injected by the pulsar and accelerated at the termination shock . in the crab nebula",
    ", the particle spectrum above @xmath2tev responsible for the x - ray to gamma - ray synchrotron emission is well modeled by a single power - law distribution of index @xmath3 , which is usually associated with first - order fermi acceleration at the shock front ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . since the detections of the first flares of high - energy gamma rays in 2010 and the following ones detected since then @xcite , we know that the crab nebula occasionally accelerates particles up to a few @xmath4  ev ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this discovery is very puzzling because the particles are accelerated to such energies within a few days , which corresponds to their larmor gyration time in the nebula .",
    "this is far too fast for fermi - type acceleration mechanisms which operate over multiple crossings of the particles through the shock ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the observed particle spectrum is very hard , which is not compatible with the steep power - law @xmath5 expected with diffuse shock - acceleration @xcite .",
    "even more surprising , the particles emit synchrotron radiation above the well - established radiation reaction limit photon energy of @xmath1mev @xcite .",
    "it implies that the particles must be subject to extreme synchrotron cooling over a sub - larmor timescale .",
    "hence , in principle , synchrotron cooling should prevent the acceleration of pairs to such high energies in the first place .",
    "fortunately , there is a simple way to circumvent these tight constraints on particle acceleration if there is a region of strong coherent electric field associated with a low magnetic field perpendicular to the particle motion , i.e. , if @xmath6 .",
    "this supposes that a non - ideal , dissipative magnetohydrodynamic process is at work somewhere in the nebula . using a simple semi - analytical approach , @xcite and @xcite showed that such extreme particle acceleration can occur within a sweet - parker - like reconnection layer , where the reversing reconnecting magnetic field traps and confines the highest energy particles deep inside the layer where @xmath6 .",
    "the reconnection electric field accelerates the particles almost linearly along a few light - day long layer .",
    "this solution solves the sub - larmor acceleration problem at the same time .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of relativistic pair plasma reconnection with radiation reaction force have confirmed and strengthened the viability of this scenario @xcite .",
    "these simulations can also explain the observed rapid intra - flare time variability of the @xmath7mev synchrotron flux , the apparent photon spectral shape , as well as the flux / cutoff energy correlation @xcite .",
    "although these 2d pic simulations provide a fairly complete assessment of extreme particle acceleration in reconnection layers , it is still a simplified picture of a truly three - dimensional process .",
    "we know from previous 3d reconnection studies @xcite that the reconnection layer is unstable to the relativistic tearing and kink modes , and a combination of these two into oblique modes .",
    "the kink ( and oblique ) instabilities , which can not arise in the 2d simulations of @xcite , can lead to significant deformation or even disruption of the reconnection layer in 3d simulations , subsequently suppressing particle acceleration .",
    "however , a moderate guide magnetic field can stabilize the layer @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the previous 2d study of @xcite by performing large 3d pic simulations of pair plasma reconnection with radiative feedback and with guide field , in the context of the crab flares . in the next section ,",
    "we first present the numerical techniques and the setup of the simulations chosen for this study .",
    "then , we investigate separately the effect of the tearing and the kink instabilities on the efficiency of particle acceleration , using a set of 2d simulations in section  [ results2d ] . in section  [ results3d ] , we establish the conditions for particle acceleration above the radiation reaction limit and emission of @xmath7mev synchrotron radiation in 3d reconnection .",
    "in addition , we report in this section on strong anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the highest - energy particles in 3d reconnection consistent with 2d results , and their important role in explaining the observed _ fermi_-lat gamma - ray flux of the crab flares .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results of this work in section  [ ccl ] .",
    "all the simulations presented in this work were performed with zeltron , a parallel three - dimensional electromagnetic pic code @xcite .",
    "zeltron solves self - consistently maxwell s equations using the yee finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) algorithm @xcite , and newton s equation following the boris fdtd algorithm @xcite .",
    "unlike most pic codes , zeltron includes the effect of the radiation reaction force in newton s equation ( or the so - called `` lorentz - abraham - dirac equation '' ) induced by the emission of radiation by the particles ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the ultra - relativistic regime , the radiation reaction force , @xmath8 , is akin to a continuous friction force , proportional to the radiative power and opposite to the particle s direction of motion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the expression of the radiation reaction force used in zeltron is given by @xmath9\\mathbf{u } , \\label{gforce}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 cm is the classical radius of the electron , @xmath11 is the lorentz factor of the particle , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electric and magnetic fields , and @xmath14 is the four - velocity divided by the speed of light .",
    "this formulation is valid if @xmath15 , where @xmath16 g is the quantum critical magnetic field .",
    "because of the relativistic effects , the typical frequency of the expected radiation is @xmath17 times the relativistic cyclotron frequency .",
    "hence , the radiation is not resolved by the grid and time step of the simulation .",
    "it must be calculated separately .",
    "zeltron computes the emitted optically thin radiation ( spectrum , and angular distributions ) assuming it is pure synchrotron radiation .",
    "this is valid if the change of the particle energy is small , @xmath18 , during the formation length of a synchrotron photon , given by the relativistic larmor radius divided by @xmath11 .",
    "we checked _",
    "a posteriori _ that this assumption is indeed correct .",
    "the code also models the inverse compton drag force on the particle motion in an imposed photon field , but this effect is negligible in the context of the crab flares @xcite , hence this capability will not be utilized in the following . to perform the large 3d simulations presented in this paper , zeltron ran on 97,200 cores on the kraken supercomputer with nearly perfect scaling .     with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "the box initially contains two flat , anti - parallel , relativistic harris layers in the @xmath19-plane centered at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , of some thickness @xmath22 .",

    "the computational domain is a rectangular box of dimensions @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively along the @xmath24- , @xmath42- and @xmath26-directions , with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "we set up the simulation with two flat anti - parallel relativistic harris current layers @xcite in the @xmath19-plane located at @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( figure  [ fig_config ] ) .",
    "having two current sheets is only a convenient numerical artifact that allows us to use periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath42-direction , but it does not have a physical meaning in the context of our model of the crab flares where only one reconnection layer is involved .",
    "the electric current , @xmath43 , flows in the @xmath44-directions , and is supported by electrons counter - streaming with positrons at a mildly relativistic drift velocity ( relative to the speed of light ) @xmath45 . the plasma ( electrons and positrons ) is spatially distributed throughout the domain , with the following density profile @xmath46^{-2}+0.1n_0 & \\mbox{if } & y < l_{\\rm y}/2\\\\ n_0\\left[\\cosh\\left(\\frac{y-3l_{\\rm y}/4}{\\delta}\\right)\\right]^{-2}+0.1n_0 & \\mbox{if } & y > l_{\\rm y}/2 \\end{array } \\right . . \\label{plasma_density}\\ ] ] the first term is the density of the drifting pairs carrying the initial current , concentrated within the layer half - thickness @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the relativistic debye length @xcite . this population is modeled with a uniform and isotropic ( in the co - moving frame ) distribution of macro - particles with variable weights to account for the density profile and to decrease the numerical noise in low - density regions .",
    "the second term is a uniform and isotropic background pair plasma at rest in the laboratory frame with a density chosen to be 10 times lower than at the center of the layers ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the drifting and the background particles are distributed in energy according to a relativistic maxwellian with the same temperature @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath52 is the rest mass of the electron . the temperature of the drifting particles is defined in the co - moving frame .",
    "this temperature models the ultra - relativistic plasma already present in the crab nebula , prior to reconnection , whose particles could have been accelerated at the wind termination shock or even by other reconnection events throughout the nebula .",
    "however , observations show that in reality the background plasma is distributed according to a broad and steep power - law , extending roughly between @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( responsible for the uv to 100 mev synchrotron spectrum ) .",
    "this large dynamic range of particle energies translates directly into an equally large dynamic range of relativistic larmor radii and hence of length scales that must be resolved in the simulation , which is beyond the reach of our numerical capabilities .",
    "the initial electromagnetic field configuration is @xmath55 where @xmath56 are unit vectors along the @xmath24- and @xmath26-directions .",
    "@xmath23 is the upstream reconnecting magnetic field and @xmath57 is a dimensionless parameter of the simulation that quantifies the strength of the guide field component @xmath58 in units of @xmath23 ( figure  [ fig_config ] ) .",

    "hence , the energy scale at which the radiation reaction force equals the electric force , assuming that @xmath63  mg , is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fundamental electric charge .",
    "below , we express lengths in units of the typical initial larmor radius of the particles in the simulations , i.e. , @xmath66 cm . in all the simulations ,",
    "the layer half - thickness is then @xmath67 and the relativistic collisionless electron skin - depth @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , timescales are given in units of the gyration time of the bulk of the particles in the plasma , i.e. , @xmath69s .",
    "the initial distribution of fields and plasma results in a low plasma-@xmath70 or high magnetization of the upstream plasma ( i.e. , outside the layers ) . here",
    ", the magnetization parameter is @xmath71 .",
    "the system is initially set at an equilibrium , i.e. , there is a force balance across the reconnection layers between the magnetic pressure and the drifting particle pressure .",
    "this equilibrium is unstable to two competing instabilities , namely the relativistic tearing and kink instabilities , as well as oblique modes that combine tearing and kink modes @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we choose here not to apply any initial perturbation in order to avoid any artificial enhancement of one type of instability over the other .",
    "instabilities are seeded with the numerical noise only .",
    "this choice has a direct computational cost because the lack of perturbation significantly delays the onset of reconnection ( see sections  [ evol ] ,  [ evol3d ] ) , but it enables a fair comparison between the growth rates of both instabilities ( sections  [ fou ] ,  [ fou3d ] ) .",
    "another important consequence of this choice specific to this study is the significant radiative cooling of the particles before reconnection can accelerate them ( section  [ spec2d ] ) .              in this work",
    ", we performed a series of @xmath72 simulations .",
    "this set includes @xmath73 2d simulations , and @xmath74 3d simulations .",
    "the 2d simulations are designed to study the effect of the guide field strength , @xmath75 and @xmath34 on the developments of instabilities ( kink and tearing ) and on particle acceleration / emission . to analyze the developments both instabilities separately ,",
    "we follow the same approach as @xcite , i.e. , we consider the dynamics of the harris current layers in the @xmath76-plane where the tearing modes alone develop similarly to our previous study in @xcite , and in the @xmath77-plane where the kink modes alone develop ( the kink and the tearing modes are perpendicular to each other ) . the box is square of size @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath28 cells and 16 particles per cell ( all species together ) . the spatial resolution is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the grid spacing in the @xmath24-direction ( @xmath82 ) , which ensures the conservation of the total energy to within @xmath83 error throughout the simulation . from this 2d scan",
    ", we identify the best / worst conditions for efficient particle acceleration and emission above the radiation reaction limit in 3d .",
    "the 3d box is cubical of size @xmath84 with @xmath37 grid cells and @xmath85 particles per cell ( all species together ) .",
    "the simulation time step is set at @xmath86 times the critical courant - friedrichs - lewy time step , @xmath87 in 2d and @xmath88 in 3d , in order to maintain satisfactory total energy conservation in the presence of strong radiative damping .",
    "table  [ tab_simu ] enumerates all the simulations presented here .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss the results of the 2d runs listed in table  [ tab_simu ] .",
    "after describing the overall time evolution of the reconnection layers in the @xmath76- and @xmath77-planes ( section  [ evol ] ) , we present a fourier analysis of the tearing and kink instabilities as a function of the guide field strength ( section  [ fou ] ) .",
    "then , we deduce from the particle and photon spectra the most / least favorable conditions for particle acceleration beyond @xmath89 and synchrotron emission @xmath7mev in 3d ( section  [ spec2d ] ) .      figure  [ fig_xy ] shows the time evolution of the total plasma density and field lines at four characteristic stages of 2d magnetic reconnection in the @xmath76-plane with @xmath90 ( run 2dxy0 ) . because there is no initial perturbation ,",
    "the layers remain static until @xmath91 when the layer tears apart into about 7 plasmoids per layer separated by x - points where field lines reconnect .",
    "the noise of the macro - particles in the pic code is sufficient to seed the tearing instability .",
    "the reconnection electric field @xmath92 is maximum at x - points and is responsible for most of particle acceleration .",
    "the high magnetic tension of freshly reconnected field lines pushes the plasma towards the @xmath93-directions and drives the large scale reconnection outflow that forces magnetic islands to merge with each other .",
    "reconnection proceeds until there is only one big island per layer remaining in the box . at the end of the simulation ( @xmath94 ) , about @xmath95 of the initial magnetic energy",
    "is dissipated in the form of particle kinetic energy .",
    "all the energy gained by the particles is then lost via the emission of synchrotron radiation . adding a guide field",
    "does not suppress the tearing instability , but it creates a charge separation across the layer that induces a strong @xmath96 electric field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_zy ] presents the time evolution of the 2d simulation in the @xmath77-plane with no guide field ( run 2dyz0 ) .",
    "the initial setup of fields and particles is identical to run 2dxy0 , except that the reconnecting field ( @xmath97 ) is now perpendicular to the simulation plane .",
    "hence , reconnection and tearing modes can not be captured by this simulation .",
    "instead , we observe the development of the kink instability as early as @xmath98 in the form of a small sinusoidal deformation of the current sheets with respect to the initial layer mid - plane .",
    "the sinusoidal deformation proceeds along the @xmath26-direction , with the deformation amplitude in the @xmath42-direction increasing rapidly up to about a quarter of the simulation box size ( about @xmath99 ) . at this stage ,",
    "the folded current layers are disrupted , leading to fast and efficient magnetic dissipation .",
    "about @xmath100 of the total magnetic energy is dissipated by the end of the simulation .",
    "the guide field has a dramatic influence on the stability of the layers .",
    "the amplitude of the deformation as well as the magnetic energy dissipated decreases with increasing guide field . for @xmath101 ,",
    "the layers remain flat during the entire duration of the simulation and no magnetic energy is dissipated . in this case , the only noticeable time evolution is a slight decrease of the layer thickness due to synchrotron cooling . to maintain pressure balance across the layers with the unchanged upstream magnetic field",
    ", the layer must compress to compensate for the radiative energy losses @xcite .",
    "we observed also a compression of the reconnection layer in the @xmath76-reconnection simulations .",
    "to compare the relative strength of the tearing instability versus the kink instability , we perform a spectral analysis of the fastest growing modes that develop in the simulations . to study the kink instability , we do a fast fourier transform ( fft ) along the @xmath26-direction of the small variations of the reconnecting magnetic field in the bottom layer mid - plane , @xmath102 , during the early phase of the 2d simulations in the @xmath77-plane .",
    "for the tearing modes , we follow the same procedure for the fluctuations in the reconnected field along the @xmath24-direction , @xmath103 , in the 2d simulations in the @xmath76-plane .",
    "we present in figure  [ fig_disp ] the time evolution of the fastest growing modes as well as the dispersion relations for the tearing and kink modes , with no guide field . in the linear regime ( @xmath104 ) , we infer the growth rates by fitting the amplitude of each mode with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the growth rate of the mode of wave - number @xmath51 .",
    "we find that the fastest growing tearing mode is at @xmath107 , which coincides with the analytical expectation of @xmath108 @xcite as found by @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of this mode is @xmath109 ; this explains the number of plasmoids formed in the early stages of reconnection ( see top right panel in figure  [ fig_xy ] ) .",
    "the fastest growing kink mode has a wavelength @xmath110 ( or @xmath111 ) which is consistent with the deformation of the current layers observed in figure  [ fig_zy ] , top right panel .",
    "the corresponding growth rate is @xmath112 , which is comparable with the fastest tearing growth rate , @xmath113 ( figure  [ fig_disp ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "this is expected for an ultra - relativistic plasma ( @xmath114 ) with a drift velocity @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the dispersion relations for both the kink and the tearing instabilities are not sharply peaked around the fastest growing modes ; a broad range of low - frequency modes is almost equally unstable ( i.e. , for @xmath115 ) .    in agreement with @xcite and",
    "as pointed out in section  [ evol ] , we find that the kink instability depends sensitively on the guide field strength .",
    "figure  [ fig_rate ] shows that the fastest growth rate decreases rapidly between @xmath116 and @xmath117 from @xmath112 to undetectable levels .",
    "thus , the guide field stabilizes the layer along the @xmath26-direction .",
    "in contrast , as mentioned earlier in section  [ evol ] , the tearing growth rate depends only mildly on @xmath57 ; we note a decrease from @xmath113 for @xmath90 to @xmath118 for @xmath119 . for @xmath120 ,",

    "from the previous section , we find that the tearing and kink modes grow at a similar rate and wavelength in our setup .",

    "the kink instability tends to disrupt the layer , which prevents non - thermal particle acceleration and emission above the standard radiation reaction limit .",
    "it is desirable to impose a moderate guide field to diminish the negative effect of the kink on particle acceleration , but too strong a guide field is not advantageous either , as it decreases the maximum energy reached by the particles and radiation .",

    "the initial stage where the layer remains apparently static lasts for about @xmath162 , i.e. , half of the whole simulation time . at @xmath163 , overdensities appear in the layers in the form of 7 - 8 tubes ( flux ropes ) elongated along the @xmath26-direction .",
    "these structures are generated by the tearing instability and are the 3d generalization of the magnetic islands observed in 2d reconnection .",
    "as the simulation proceeds into the non - linear regime , the flux ropes merge with each other creating bigger ones , as magnetic islands do in 2d reconnection .",
    "however , in 3d this process does not happen at the same time everywhere along the @xmath26-direction , which results in the formation of a network of interconnected flux ropes at intermediate times ( @xmath164 ) .    in parallel",
    "to this process , the kink instability deforms the two layers along the @xmath26-direction in the form of sine - like translation of the layers mid - planes in the @xmath165-directions . during the most active period of reconnection ( @xmath166 ) , the kink instability takes over and eventually destroys the flux ropes formed by the tearing modes ( see left bottom panel in figure  [ fig_3d ] ) .",
    "only a few coherent structures survive at the end of the simulation ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "in particular the reconnection electric field , which is strongest along the x - lines between two flux ropes , loses its initial coherence .",
    "this results in efficient particle heating but poor particle acceleration ( see below , section  [ spec3d ] ) . at the end of this run about @xmath168 of the total magnetic energy",

    "in contrast , the tearing instability seems undisturbed and breaks the layer into a network of 8 flux tubes . towards the end of the simulation ,",

    "the fastest tearing mode has a growth rate @xmath179 at @xmath180 and generates the @xmath181 initial flux ropes obtained in the simulation .",

    "the existence of these modes is reflected by the flux ropes being slightly tilted in the @xmath19-plane .",
    "adding an @xmath158 guide field decreases the amplitude of the low - frequency ( @xmath182 ) growth rates of the kink modes ( figure  [ fig_disp2d_guide ] ) .",
    "in particular , the growth rate of the fastest mode for @xmath90 , @xmath183 , decreases from @xmath184 to @xmath185 . as a result , the fastest growing kink mode is now at @xmath186 with a rate @xmath187 , while the fastest growing tearing modes is approximatively unchanged , in excellent agreement with the 2d runs ( figure  [ fig_disp2d_guide ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_spec_3d ] presents the particle and photon energy distributions averaged over all directions at @xmath188 , with no guide field .",
    "the distributions are remarkably similar to the 2d run 2dyz0 ones , and differ significantly from run 2dxy0 . the high - energy part of the particle spectrum peaks at @xmath189 which is the signature of particle heating via magnetic dissipation rather than particle acceleration through tearing - dominated reconnection ( section  [ spec2d ] , eq .  [ gmax_kink ] ) .",
    "we note that the spectrum extends to higher energy than the pure magnetic dissipation scenario , slightly above @xmath89 , suggesting that there is a non - thermal component as well . on the contrary , in the @xmath158 guide field case ( run 3dg050 , figure  [ fig_spec_3d_guide ] ) , things are closer to the pure tearing reconnection case of run 2dxy050 .",
    "the particle energy distribution is almost flat in the @xmath190 range , but barely reaches above @xmath89 as in the zero - guide field case .",
    "nevertheless , the synchrotron emission @xmath7mev is more intense than in the zero guide field case .",
    "even though there is clear evidence for particle acceleration above the radiation reaction limit , the effect remains slightly weaker than in 2d with no guide field .",
    "a bigger box size would help to improve the significance of this result .",
    "the angular distribution of the particles is of critical interest for determining the apparent isotropic radiation flux seen by a distant observer who probes one direction only . in 2d reconnection",
    ", we expect a pronounced beaming of the particles that increases rapidly with their energy @xcite .",
    "we confirm here that this phenomenon exists also in 3d , even with a finite guide field .",
    "figure  [ fig_anis ] presents energy - resolved maps of the angular distribution of the positrons ( left panels ) and their optically thin synchrotron radiation ( right panel ) in run 3d050 .",
    "the direction of motion of the particles is measured with two angles : the latitude , @xmath191 , varying between @xmath192 and @xmath193 , defined as @xmath194 and the longitude , @xmath195 , defined between @xmath196 and @xmath197 given by @xmath198 where @xmath199 , and @xmath200 are the components of the particle 4-velocity vector .",
    "we find that the low - energy particles ( @xmath201 ) nearly conserve the initially imposed isotropy , because they are still upstream and have not been energized by reconnection .",
    "in contrast , the high - energy particles ( @xmath202 ) are significantly beamed along the reconnection plane ( at x - lines and with flux ropes ) within @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "the @xmath204 angle is of special interest here because it coincides with the direction of the undisturbed magnetic field lines outside the reconnection layers for a @xmath158 guide field ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "the particles are accelerated along the @xmath26-direction by the reconnection electric field , and move back and forth across the layer mid - plane following relativistic speiser orbits @xcite . at the same time , the particles are deflected away by the reconnected field and the guide field creating a characteristic `` s '' shape in the angular maps . to a lesser extent , the zero - guide field case also presents some degree of anisotropy , but the deformation and then the disruption of the layer by the kink instability effectively broaden the beams .",
    "the synchrotron angular distribution closely follows the particle one , essentially because relativistic particles radiate along their direction of motion within a cone of semi - aperture angle @xmath206 .",
    "however , there is a noticeable offset between the distribution of the highest - energy particles with @xmath207 and the radiation above @xmath60  mev .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the different zones where particles accelerate and where particles radiate . in the accelerating zone",
    ", the electric field is intense and leads to linear particle acceleration along the @xmath26-axis , whereas the perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath208 , is weak deep inside the reconnection layers , yielding little synchrotron radiation .",

    "the particle spectrum in the ( @xmath214 ) direction is very hard , and peaks at @xmath215 with a total apparent isotropic energy @xmath216erg , which corresponds to about half the total magnetic energy dissipated by the end of the simulation , or about 10 times more energy than in the isotropic distribution . the photon spectrum in the ( @xmath211 ) direction peaks at about @xmath0mev but extends up to @xmath217gev .",
    "the resulting gamma - ray luminosity above 100  mev is @xmath218erg / s , which is about 40 times brighter than the isotropically averaged flux from the layer , and about 3 times brighter than the observed average ( quiescent ) luminosity of the crab nebula ( @xmath219erg / s , assuming a distance of 2  kpc between the nebula and the observer ) .",
    "thanks to beaming , the level of gamma rays expected from the model is consistent with the moderately bright flares , such as the february 2009 or september 2010 ones ( see figure  [ fig_spec_anis ] , bottom panel ) , but the simulation can not reproduce the flux of the brightest flares , such as the april 2011 event .",

    "shorter variability timescales may still exist in the simulation but our measurement is limited by the data dumping period set at @xmath229 .",
    "these synthetic lightcurves also clearly illustrate the effect of the particle beaming on the observed flux discussed in section  [ comp_obs ] . along the direction of the beam",

    "each time the beam crosses our line of sight , we see a rapid bright flare of the most energetic radiation emitted in the simulation .    the high - energy particles are strongly bunched within the magnetic flux ropes ( within magnetic islands in 2d , see @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the typical size of the emitting regions is comparable to the dimensions of the flux ropes , i.e. , of order @xmath232 along the @xmath24- and @xmath42-directions ( figure  [ fig_3d ] ) , which corresponds to about @xmath228  light - hours .",
    "we conclude that particle bunching is at the origin of the ultra - short time variability ( @xmath227-@xmath228 hours ) found in the reconstructed lightcurve ( figure  [ fig_lightcurve ] ) .",
    "particle bunching and anisotropy help to alleviate the severe energetic constraints imposed by the crab flares .",
    "we found that , unlike classical models of particle acceleration , 3d relativistic pair plasma reconnection can accelerate particles above the standard radiation reaction limit in the crab nebula .",
    "we also confirm the existence of a strong energy - dependent anisotropy of the particles and their radiation , resulting in an apparent boosting of the high - energy radiation observed when the beam crosses our line of sight . in this case , the simulated gamma - ray flux @xmath220mev exceeds the measured quiescent flux from the nebula by a factor 2 - 3 , and reproduces well the flux of moderately bright flares , such as the february 2009 or the september 2010 events . simulating brighter flares ( e.g. , the april 2011 flare ) may be achieved with a larger box size .",
    "in addition , the bunching of the energetic particles within the magnetic flux ropes results in rapid time variations of the observed gamma - ray flux ( @xmath233  hours ) .",
    "the results are consistent with observations of the crab flares and with our previous 2d simulations @xcite , although this extreme acceleration is less pronounced than in 2d due to the deformation of the layer by the kink instability in 3d .",
    "if there is no guide field , we found that the kink instability grows faster than the tearing instability , resulting in the disruption of the reconnection layers and significant particle heating rather than reconnection and non - thermal particle acceleration . in agreement with @xcite , we observe that a moderate guide field ( @xmath234 ) is enough to reduce the negative effect of the kink on the acceleration of particles . however , a strong guide field ( i.e. , @xmath235 ) quenches particle acceleration and the emission of high - energy emission because it deflects the particles away from the x - lines too rapidly .    applying a guide field",
    "is probably not the only way to suppress kink instability . in the harris configuration , an initial ultra - relativistic drifting particle flow ( with @xmath236 )",
    "is expected to foster tearing - dominated reconnection @xcite as observed by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , starting with an out - of - equilibrium layer could also drive a fast onset of reconnection @xcite . in real systems ,",
    "the reconnection layer is not likely to be smooth , flat , undisturbed , and in equilibrium .",
    "a small perturbation in the field lines , like a pre - existing x - point , can favor fast reconnection before the kink instability has time to grow .",
    "hence , while we have shown one set of conditions emitting @xmath7mev radiation , there may be other conditions allowing reconnection to produce similar results .",
    "the reconnection model could be refined if future multi - wavelength observations can pin down the location of the flares in the crab nebula ( so far there is nothing obvious , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one promising location for reconnection - powered flares could be within the jets in the polar regions where the plasma is expected to be highly magnetized ( i.e. , @xmath237 ) with stronger magnetic field close to the pulsar rotational axis @xcite . in addition , theoretical studies @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite , and possibly x - ray observations @xcite indicate that the jets are unstable to kink instabilities .",
    "the non - linear development of these instabilities could lead to the formation of current sheets , presumably with a non - zero guide field , and then to magnetic dissipation in the crab nebula in the form of powerful gamma - ray flares , which may contribute to solving the `` @xmath238-problem '' in pulsar wind nebulae @xcite .",
    "relativistic reconnection may also be at the origin of other astrophysical flares .",
    "most notably , tev gamma - ray flares observed in blazars ( e.g. , @xcite ) present challenges similar to the crab flares ( e.g. , ultra - short time variability , problematic energetics ) that could be solved by invoking relativistic reconnection in a highly magnetized jet @xcite .",
    "the physical conditions in blazar jets are quite different than in the crab nebula ( e.g. , composition , inverse compton drag , pair creation ) , which may change the dynamics of reconnection . the current sheet that forms beyond the light - cylinder in pulsars offers another interesting environment for studying relativistic reconnection subject to strong synchrotron cooling .",
    "pairs energized by reconnection may be at the origin of the gev pulsed emission in gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "we speculate that synchrotron radiation from the particles could even account for the recently reported @xmath220gev pulsed emission from the crab ( see , e.g. , ) if particle acceleration above the radiation reaction limit operates in this context .",
