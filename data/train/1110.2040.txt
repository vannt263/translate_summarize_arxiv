    "entanglement , being considered as the resource of quantum computation , quantum cryptography and quantum information processing , has been a major focus of research in quantum mechanics [ 1 ] .",
    "however , recent investigations have demonstrated that quantum entanglement is not the only kind of useful correlation present in quantum states .",
    "for instance , the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit does not require entanglement [ 2 ] .",
    "moreover , it has been shown both theoretically and experimentally that some separable states might also perform better than their classical counterparts for certain tasks [ 3 - 8 ] .",
    "many different correlation measures have been proposed to detect the nonclassical correlations that can not be captured by entanglement [ 9 - 12 ] . among them , quantum discord [ 9 ] , defined as the difference between quantum versions of two classically equivalent expressions for mutual information , has attracted considerable attention [ 13 - 22 ] .",
    "unfortunately , evaluation of quantum discord requires a potentially complex optimization procedure in general and analytical results have been obtained only in few restricted cases of qubit - qubit and qubit - qudit systems [ 23 - 33 ] . in order to overcome this difficulty , geometric measure of quantum discord",
    "has been introduced as an alternative to measure the nearest distance between a given state and the set of zero - discord states [ 34 - 37 ] .",
    "decoherence , the process through which quantum states lose their phase relations due to interactions with the environment , is crucial for understanding the emergence of classicality in quantum systems [ 38 ] .",
    "one of the most striking features of this unavoidable system - environment interaction on the dynamics of entanglement is the experimentally confirmed [ 39 ] phenomenon of the total loss of entanglement in finite time , which is termed as entanglement sudden death ( esd ) [ 39 - 47 ] . on the other hand , both markovian and non - markovian dynamics of more general quantum and classical correlations",
    "have been investigated extensively under various decoherence models [ 48 - 76 ] . under the conditions where entanglement exhibits a sudden death ,",
    "quantum discord has been shown to disappear instantaneously in non - markovian environments [ 48 - 50 ] and has been observed to resist sudden death in markovian environments [ 51 ] .",
    "another remarkable result first demonstrated in ref .",
    "[ 52 ] , is the existence of a sharp transition between classical and quantum loss of correlations , which has also been experimentally confirmed [ 53 ] .",
    "this sudden transition implies that there exists a finite time interval , in which only classical correlation is lost and quantum discord is unaffected by noisy environment .",
    "consequently , it has been suggested that quantum discord may be more robust than entanglement , and quantum computation models based on quantum discord correlations might be more relevant than those based on entanglement .    in this work ,",
    "we consider two different one - parameter families of qubit - qutrit states , interacting with a classical dephasing environment .",
    "we study the time evolution of correlations as quantified by negativity , quantum discord , geometric discord and classical correlation both for the cases of multilocal and global dephasing noise . by making a comparative analysis of these correlation measures ,",
    "we discuss the effects of initial conditions on the dynamics of the qubit - qutrit system . even for simple one - parameter classes of states ,",
    "we identify several fundamentally different types of dynamics , including the phenomenon of sudden transition between classical and quantum decoherence .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows . in section 2 , we introduce the decoherence model and its solution both for the cases of multilocal and collective dephasing noise . in section 3 , we give a review of the correlation measures used in our discussion . in section 4 , we analyze the dynamics of these correlation measures for certain qubit - qutrit state families .",
    "section 5 includes the summary of our results .",
    "we consider a composite system of uncoupled spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 objects , both of which are under the effect of stochastic environmental fluctuations .",
    "the model hamiltonian we use can be thought as the representative of the class of interactions generating a pure dephasing process [ 77,78 ] that is defined as @xmath2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we take @xmath3 .",
    "while @xmath4 is the usual pauli spin operator in z - direction , @xmath5 corresponds to z - component of the three level spin @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 are stochastic noise fields that lead to statistically independent markov processes satisfying @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for ensemble average , and @xmath13 is the damping rate associated with the stochastic field @xmath8 .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix of the system is given by @xmath14 where ensemble averages are evaluated over the three noise fields and the time evolution operator , @xmath15 , is obtained as @xmath16.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume that all the damping parameters are the same @xmath17 for the sake of simplicity . first , we focus our attention to the case of multilocal dephasing , i.e. , @xmath18 . in this",
    "setting , qubit and qutrit are only interacting with their own environments locally .",
    "the resulting time - evolved density matrix in the product basis @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the elements of the initial density matrix @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "second , we consider a global dephasing scenario where the spins are interacting with a shared environment collectively and local baths are absent , i.e. , @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", dynamics of the initial density matrix can be expressed in the same basis as @xmath25 we note that some elements of the initial density matrix @xmath22 are not affected by decoherence in collective dephasing setting , which is an indicator of the existence of decoherence - free subspaces .",
    "before starting to discuss the dynamics of quantum correlations , we review the correlation measures used in our investigation , namely , negativity , quantum discord and geometric measure of quantum discord .",
    "the quantification of entanglement is well understood for the case of two - qubits [ 79,80 ] , but little is known about its generalization to higher dimensional bipartite mixed states .",
    "negativity is an entanglement measure which can be easily calculated for any bipartite entangled state having negative partial transpose in all dimensions . although we can not conclude whether a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) state ( zero negativity state ) is entangled or separable in general , it has been shown that all ppt states of qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit systems are separable [ 81,82 ]",
    "thus , qubit - qutrit entanglement is fully characterized by negativity . for a given density matrix @xmath26",
    ", negativity can be defined as twice the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of partial transpose of @xmath26 with respect to the smaller dimensional system , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are all of the eigenvalues of @xmath29 .",
    "this definition ensures that negativity of maximally entangled qubit - qutrit states are normalized to one .",
    "the total amount of quantum and classical correlations in a qubit - qutrit state can be obtained without difficulty by evaluating the quantum mutual information which is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath26 and @xmath31 @xmath32 are the density matrix of the total system and reduced density matrix of subsystems , respectively , and @xmath33 is the von - neumann entropy . on the other hand , a measure of classical correlations contained in a quantum state is provided by [ 9,10 ] @xmath34 where @xmath35 defines a set of orthonormal projectors ( a von - neumann measurement ) , performed on subsystem @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the remaining state of subsystem @xmath38 after obtaining the outcome @xmath39 with the probability @xmath40 .",
    "we intend to evaluate @xmath41 for qubit - qutrit states assuming that the measurement is performed on the qubit part of the hybrid system .",
    "a von - neumann measurement @xmath42 can be represented by @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the usual pauli spin operators and @xmath45 is a unit vector on the bloch sphere with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "quantum discord [ 9 ] , which measures the amount of quantum correlations , is then defined as the difference between total and classical correlations @xmath48 it is possible to show that quantum discord is not a symmetric quantity in general , meaning its value depends on whether the measurement is performed on subsystem a or b. since the calculation of classical correlation involves a potentially complex optimization process , there exists no general analytical expression of discord even for the simplest case of two - qubit states . for the relatively simple qubit - qutrit mixed states used in our study , we will obtain the quantum discord via numerical optimization of the von - neumann measurements , which will include a minimization over two independent real parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    in order to overcome the difficulties experienced with the analytical calculation of quantum discord ,",
    "an alternative geometrized version called geometric measure of quantum discord has been proposed [ 34 ] .",
    "it measures the nearest distance between a given state and the set of zero - discord states .",
    "geometric discord can be mathematically defined as @xmath51 where the minimum is over the set of zero - discord states and the geometric quantity @xmath52 denotes the square of the hilbert - schmidt norm .",
    "a state @xmath53 on @xmath54 has vanishing discord if and only if it is a classical - quantum state , that is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a probability distribution , @xmath57 is an arbitrary orthonormal basis for @xmath58 and @xmath59 is a set of arbitrary density operators on @xmath60 .",
    "recently , an exact analytical formula has been obtained for the geometric discord of a bipartite state of @xmath61 dimensions [ 35,37 ] .",
    "since our discussion only involves qubit - qutrit states , we focus on the case of @xmath62 states .",
    "the density operators acting on a bipartite system @xmath54 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be represented as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the traceless hermitian generators of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , satisfying @xmath70 .",
    "the components of the local bloch vectors @xmath71 and the correlation matrix @xmath72 can be calculated as @xmath73 then , the exact formula for geometric discord of qubit - qutrit states can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the greatest eigenvalue of the matrix ( @xmath77 . since geometric discord is not normalized to one and its value for maximally entangled qubit - qutrit states are @xmath78 , we will consider the quantity @xmath79 as we compare the geometric discord with other correlation measures .",
    "in the following sections , we will investigate the correlation dynamics for two different one - parameter families of qubit - qutrit states : entangled @xmath80 and separable @xmath81 defined by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that the entangled family @xmath80 is separable only for @xmath85 .",
    "we first discuss the time evolution of correlations under multilocal classical dephasing noise .",

    "on the other hand , both of the families have non - vanishing geometric discord in general , which can be calculated as @xmath89,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath90.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    _ dynamics of the entangled family . _",
    "we start our investigation by considering @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "correlation dynamics of these two states are completely different from the other members of the family . for @xmath92 , fig .",
    "1(a ) displays that while classical correlation is not affected by external noise , all three quantum correlations decay in a monotonic fashion . in this case",
    ", negativity seems to be more robust than quantum and geometric discords . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath91 is a maximally entangled state and its general behavior is almost the same as @xmath92 except all of its correlations are one initially .",
    "dynamics of the correlations for the remaining members of the family are far more interesting . for all of the states corresponding to the regime @xmath93 ( excluding @xmath85 )",
    ", entanglement disappears in a finite time suffering esd .",
    "more important , we observe the sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence [ 52 ] , i.e , there exists a critical instant @xmath94 at which the quantum state stops losing classical correlation and starts losing quantum discord .",
    "geometric discord fails to keep up with quantum discord in the classical decoherence region , but its decay still suddenly hastens at the critical time @xmath94 .",
    "1(b ) shows an example of this behavior for @xmath95 . by choosing different initial states from this family ,",
    "it is possible to prolong the time interval in which quantum discord remains constant but there exists a trade - off between the initial magnitude of the quantum discord and its survival time .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "1(c ) illustrates the case for @xmath96 .",
    "although sudden changes of all correlation measures occur at the same time instant for all the initial states considered in our study , this is not a general feature of all quantum states .",
    "examples of states have been presented in ref . [ 73 ] for which evolutions of quantum and geometric discords are not affected by the discontinuities in each others dynamics .    _",
    "dynamics of the separable family .",
    "_ the two end points of this family , namely , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , are not particulary interesting since they do not contain any kind of quantum correlations . for",
    "the initial states corresponding to the interval @xmath99 , classical correlation does not feel the noise fields , whereas quantum and geometric discords decay monotonically .",
    "however , the regime @xmath100 is definitely more interesting , since we observe an analogue of the sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence . in this case , though quantum discord is not constant and decays together with the classical correlation , we notice that geometric discord is unaffected by environment for a finite time interval",
    ". in other words , there exists an instant of time @xmath101 at which the system stops losing classical correlation and starts losing geometric discord .",
    "an example is presented in fig .",
    "1(d ) , where @xmath102 and the critical time @xmath103 . note that the state keeps losing quantum discord throughout the dynamics but as soon as @xmath101 is reached , the decay rate of quantum discord hastens .",

    "the correlation dynamics of the entangled family under collective noise is a lot richer than its dynamics under multilocal noise .",
    "while all of the correlations hold unchanged for the maximally entangled state @xmath91 , correlation dynamics of the state @xmath92 is no different than what s described in fig .",
    "1(a ) except for the fact that correlations decay faster . in the regime @xmath112 ,",
    "quantum and geometric discords are both uniformly amplified and become stable after a certain point .",
    "negativity is conserved since this regime consists of disentanglement - free states .",
    "2(a ) displays an example of this case for @xmath96 .",
    "classical correlation , which can be greater or smaller than quantum discord , decreases monotonically and gets stable as well . for the regime @xmath113",
    ", behaviors of classical correlation and quantum discord are nt changed . on the other hand ,",
    "geometric discord acquires a minimum without a sudden change .",
    "although all other correlations survive the effects of the environment , negativity disappears in a finite time suffering sudden death .",
    "2(b ) illustrates the situation for @xmath114 .",
    "it is noteworthy that geometric discord can decrease as quantum discord increases .",
    "next , we examine the interval @xmath115 . whereas the states keep experiencing esd , all other correlations show sudden changes in their evolutions at the same instant .",
    "2(c ) gives an example this behavior for @xmath116 .",
    "note that geometric discord and classical correlation diminish as quantum discord gets amplified until a critical time is reached .",
    "after that instant , both quantum and geometric discords start to weaken until they reach a stable value , but classical correlation is not affected by noise at all .    _",
    "dynamics of the separable family .",
    "_ starting with @xmath98 , we immediately see that smooth amplification of both quantum and geometric discords is possible in this setting . in the regime @xmath99 , classical correlation",
    "is unaffected by noise but quantum and geometric discords decay in a monotonic way until they eventually become stable . in the interval @xmath117",
    ", all correlations start to evolve in a different fashion but they all become discontinuous simultaneously at a certain critical instant .",

    "in summary , we have analyzed the time evolution of negativity , quantum discord , geometric discord and classical correlation for two different one - parameter families of qubit - qutrit states , assuming that the states are in a classical dephasing environment .",
    "considering the cases of multilocal and collective dephasing separately , we have noticed that dynamics of correlations are strongly dependent on the initial conditions even for one - parameter families of states . under multilocal noise",
    ", we have demonstrated the phenomenon of sudden transition between classical and quantum decoherence for hybrid qubit - qutrit systems extending the results of ref . [",
    "in fact , this transition might be a generic feature existing in all bipartite quantum systems but a definitive demonstration would require an analytic expression for quantum discord in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "furthermore , for a class of separable states , we have observed an analogue of this phenomenon .",
    "namely , geometric discord remains constant for a finite time interval while classical correlation decreases , then when geometric discord starts to decay , classical correlation becomes constant . under global noise ,",
    "dynamics of correlations are quite diverse .",
    "we have shown that although quantum and geometric discords can evolve initially completely independent of each other for a certain time period , they tend to be eventually in accord . smooth amplification of quantum and geometric discords is also possible in this case . on the other hand , we have confirmed that entanglement as quantified by negativity can suffer sudden death for qubit - qutrit states both in global and multilocal dephasing settings .",
    "our findings clearly indicate that different measures of quantum correlations are conceptually different .",
    "lastly , it should be possible to prolong the survival time of correlations by considering non - markovian extensions such as ornstein - uhlenbeck type of noise models [ 65 ] .",
