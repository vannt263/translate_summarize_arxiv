    "the statistical mechanics of polymers has become a very prolific research area . during the last decades",
    ", many models have been proposed to describe the configurational properties of linear and branched polymers and a variety of methods have been employed to study these systems .",
    "the classic model for a linear polymer in dilute solution ( or at high temperature ) is the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , connected clusters ( lattice animals ) provided a good model for branched polymers in the dilute limit @xcite .",
    "the kinetic growth walk ( kgw ) was proposed as an alternative model to describe the irreversible growth of linear polymers [ 4 - 6 ] . like the saw",
    ", every kgw chain does not intercept itself .",
    "but whereas in a saw the next step is randomly chosen from among _ all _ nearest - neighbor sites ( excluding the previous one ) , in a kgw the choice is among the _ unvisited _ sites @xcite . therefore the kgw is less sensitive to attrition . besides , although both models span the same set of configurations , the n - step saw chains are _ all _ equally weighted while the statistical weights of the kgw chains can be different",
    "nevertheless , it was shown that both models present the same critical exponents @xcite .",
    "later , lucena _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite generalized the kgw in order to allow for branching as well as for impurities . this generalized model ( which became known as the branched polymer growth model - bpgm )",
    "was found to exhibit an interesting phase transition ( due to competition between hindrances and branching ) separating infinite from finite growth regimes @xcite . in the following years",
    ", several authors have studied the bpgm [ 8 - 15 ] .",
    "the topological and dynamical aspects of the model were investigated @xcite . besides , the system was shown to achieve the criticality through a self - organization growth mechanism @xcite and to exhibit a transition from rough to faceted boundaries for large values of the branching probability @xcite .",
    "the model was also studied through an exact enumeration of bond trees and ergodicity violation was discussed @xcite .",
    "the question of the universality class of the bpgm was also investigated .",
    "in contrast to the common belief that branched polymers belong to the universality class of lattice animals @xcite , the study of the growth process in chemical @xmath3space with estimates of structural exponents led to the proposal that the bpgm belongs to the universality class of percolation @xcite . on the bethe lattice , this proposal is based on analytical results @xcite .",
    "a further analysis using finite - size scaling techniques led to the conclusion that the bpgm is _ not _ in the same universality class of percolation in two dimensions @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we revisit the bpgm on the square lattice .",
    "we point out that , although the input parameter @xmath0 is named branching probability , it does not have effective control of the relative incidence of bifurcations ( branches ) in the simulated polymers .",
    "this seems to be an undesirable aspect of the model since the degree of branching is an important quantity that is usually measured in real ramified polymers .",
    "besides , according to the growth rules of the bpgm , a monomer which is chosen to bifurcate ( with probability @xmath4 ) but has only one empty nearest neighbor site is compelled to grow linearly thus changing its functionality from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . in real experiments this change is not allowed since the concentrations of polymers with different functionalities are fixed . in order to preserve the functionalities of the monomers as well as to recover the meaning of the branching probability @xmath0 , we propose a subtle modification in the dynamics of the bpgm .",
    "so this new version of the model aims to _ adapt _ it to a more realistic scenario and is called the _ adapted branched polymer growth model _ ( abpgm ) . in the following sections , we define the abpgm and",
    "present the phase diagram in the @xmath1 space .",
    "this diagram is found to exhibit a peculiar reentrance .",
    "we introduce the concept of _ frustration _ and compare the _ effective branching rate _",
    "@xmath7 with the input parameter @xmath0 for both the original and adapted models .",
    "our results concerning the abpgm are shown to be much closer to the ideal behavior @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we present a discussion based on the clusters topologies of both models .",
    "first of all , let us review the bpgm . consider a @xmath9 square lattice with a certain concentration @xmath2 of sites randomly filled by impurities .",
    "at the initial time @xmath10 , the polymer starts growing from a monomer seed located at the center of the lattice towards a random empty nearest - neighbor site . at time",
    "@xmath11 , this chosen site is occupied by a monomer ( growing tip ) which now _ may _ bifurcate or follow in one direction ( linear growth ) .",
    "the growth directions are randomly chosen among the available ones ( those which lead to empty neighbors ) in a clockwise way . at every time @xmath12 ( @xmath13 )",
    ", the process is repeated for all actual monomeric ends following the sequence of their appearances . if a polymer end has _ no _ empty nearest - neighbor site then it is trapped in a cul de sac  and stops growing ( it is then called a _",
    "dead end _ ) .",
    "if only one adjacent site is available then the linear growth is obligatory",
    ". if at least two adjacent sites are empty then the growing end bifurcates with probability @xmath0 or follows linearly with probability @xmath14 . in a particular experiment of the bpgm",
    ", the polymer growth is simulated according to the above rules . depending on the values of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2",
    ", the polymer can either grow indefinitely or stop growing ( _ die _ ) at a finite time if all its current tips are dead ends .",
    "the experiment is finished either when the polymer touches the frontier of the lattice ( _ infinite _ polymer ) or when it dies ( _ finite _ polymer ) .",
    "the ensemble over which averages are performed is constituted by a great number @xmath15 of experiments .",
    "each polymer configuration of the bpgm can be identified with a self - avoiding loopless graph ( _ bond tree _ ) although the reciprocal is not always true @xcite .",
    "thus the bpgm can be mapped into a particular _ subset _ of the ensemble of all possible bond trees .",
    "these tree graphs have been applied in models of branched polymers and can be classified by the number @xmath16 of bonds and the number @xmath17 of vertices with @xmath18 bonds @xcite . in a typical finite polymer configuration of the bpgm , one may find twofold and threefold sites representing monomers of functionalities @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the monomer seed and dead ends represent monofunctional monomers .",
    "tetrafunctional units are impossible in this model once trifurcations are not allowed . for a tree graph generated by the bpgm one has the following constraints @xcite :    @xmath19    and    @xmath20    the occurrence of bifurcations in the model",
    "determines the relative incidence of trifunctional monomers ( branches ) .",
    "this is basically the _ degree of branching _ of the polymer , an important quantity that is usually measured in real ramified polymers .",
    "however , although the parameter @xmath4 is named _ branching probability _ , we shall see that it does _ not _ have effective control of the relative amount of branches ( bifurcations ) in the bpgm .",
    "indeed , according to the rules of the bpgm , the parameter @xmath0 is not the probability that any tip bifurcates but instead it is the conditional probability that a tip _ with two or more empty nearest neighbors _ bifurcates .",
    "every tip with just one vacant nearest - neighbor site grows linearly with probability equal to one . from another viewpoint",
    ", it would also be desirable to consider that any monomer that is linking to the polymer has an effective probability @xmath0 of being a trifunctional unit .",
    "even if this were considered in the bpgm , a problem would become evident .",
    "any growing end chosen ( with probability @xmath0 ) as a trifunctional monomer would _ not _ be able to bifurcate if only one vacant site were available . in this case , the functionality of the monomer would not be respected since ( according to the bpgm ) the growing end would forcibly follow a linear growth like a bifunctional monomer .    in order to preserve the functionalities of the monomers",
    "we propose a modification in the dynamics of the bpgm .",
    "besides to make the model a little more realistic , our proposal turns the branching probability @xmath0 into an effective control parameter of the relative frequency of bifurcations .",
    "so it _ adapts _ the model to a scenario closer to reality and experimentation .",
    "we denominate it the _ adapted branched polymer growth model _ ( abpgm ) .",
    "the abpgm is defined just like the bpgm except for the following differences :    1 .   in the process of polymerization , let a _",
    "( a growing tip with at least one empty nearest - neighbor site ) be a trifunctional monomer with probability @xmath0 or a bifunctional monomer with probability @xmath14 .",
    "if the free end is a trifunctional monomer but there is only one empty nearest neighbor site then it stops growing and becomes a dead end .",
    "2 .   at every time unit",
    ", all current sites on the front of growth of the polymer are visited in a _",
    "random _ sequence .",
    "we remember that in the bpgm , a free end with _ just one _ empty nearest neighbor grows linear with probability one while in the abpgm , since bifurcation is impossible , the free end stops and becomes a _ frustrated _ dead end .",
    "this frustration seems to be preferable and more realistic than forcing a trifunctional monomer to turn into bifunctional monomer as it occurs in the bpgm .",
    "so , in our proposal , the relative incidence of bifunctional and trifunctional monomers does not depend on the topology of the cluster anymore and is only controlled by the branching probability parameter .",
    "the second difference is also important : in the bpgm all tips are _ sequentially _ visited in a clockwise manner following the sequence of births whereas in the abpgm they are visited in a _ random _ way .",
    "the sequential update of the growth front of the polymer ( in the bpgm ) simulates the formation of parallel chains in the infinite phase ( for high @xmath0  and low @xmath21 like in a crystallization process .",
    "this mechanism leads to a faceted - to - rough transition that has been already studied @xcite .",
    "figure 1a shows a typical bpgm configuration with faceted boundary generated with parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 ) ; the parallel ordering of chains is caused by the clockwise update of the growing tips . if we simulate the bpgm using the same set of parameters but with a random update instead of the clockwise update we get figure 1b . in this case , two subsequent growing tips are probably located far apart so that they can not produce parallel chains . the boundary is less faceted than before .",
    "recently it has been shown that any deterministic growth order is _ non - ergodic _ in the sense that it spans only a subset of the space of all possible configurations @xcite . moreover , for the present purposes , this clockwise update mechanism is undesirable since the development of parallel chains corresponds to an increasing incidence of bifunctional monomers due mainly to geometrical effects rather than to the probability @xmath14 itself .",
    "the relative incidence of bifurcations ( which will be defined as _ the effective branching rate _",
    "@xmath7 in section 4 ) is much smaller than input parameter @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , we anticipate that @xmath25  for the cluster of figure 1a whereas @xmath26 for the one of figure 1b ; so the last rate ( corresponding to a bpgm cluster generated with random update ) is closer to the input value @xmath27 .",
    "the effective branching rate gets still closer to the input value if we simulate the abpgm .",
    "figure 1c is a typical abpgm configuration ( generated with those same parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and presents @xmath28 ; the faceted front of growth seems to disappear and vacancies can be found inside the cluster .     with parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 according to the bpgm rules with clockwise update of growing tips * ( a ) * , bpgm with random update * ( b ) * and abpgm * ( c)*. the corresponding effective branching rates are @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath29 , respectively.,width=188 ]    the main feature of the bpgm is the phase transition separating finite from infinite growth regime .",
    "_ @xcite have defined a critical branching probability @xmath30 where the mean size of finite polymers diverges as @xmath31 .",
    "the critical value depends on the impurity concentration @xmath2 and separates the finite phase @xmath32 from the infinite one @xmath33 .",
    "the probability that a polymer grows indefinitely is null for small values of @xmath0 and increases abruptly in the region of @xmath34 .",
    "this probability was estimated through the _ fraction _",
    "@xmath35 _ _  of infinite polymers _ _ in the ensemble of configurations of the bpgm @xcite . in figure 2a",
    ", we reproduce typical plots of @xmath36 versus @xmath0 at different values of @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 experiments and @xmath39 ) for the bpgm . in figure 2b",
    ", we present plots of @xmath36 versus @xmath0 at some values of @xmath2 corresponding to simulations of the abpgm with @xmath40 experiments and @xmath41 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath42 is analogous to that of the bpgm but now the threshold is little bit higher ( @xmath43 for the abpgm while @xmath44 for the bpgm ) .",
    "this difference increases with @xmath2 .",
    "the most interesting characteristic of the present model may be observed when @xmath45 . for this value",
    ", the curve raises at @xmath46 , then presents a plateau ( where @xmath47 ) and finally falls ! by a finite - size scaling analysis",
    "we have verified that the height of the plateau does not change significatively in the limit @xmath48 for @xmath49 , the behavior of @xmath50 is gaussian shaped .",
    "this means that , for certain impurity concentrations , as @xmath0 increases the system goes from a finite to an infinite phase and then becomes finite again ! indeed ,",
    "this reentrance is confirmed in the next section when we determine the phase diagram of the abpgm through an analysis of the correlation length .     versus @xmath0 for the bpgm * ( a ) * and abpgm * ( b)*.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]   versus @xmath0 for the bpgm * ( a ) * and abpgm * ( b)*.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]",

    "for a fixed value of @xmath60 and as @xmath0 increases , the polymer is more likely to escape from steric hindrances and impurities so that the mean size grows to its highest value at some @xmath61 . above this point ,",
    "the system is defined to be in the infinite growth regime ( of course , the true critical point is obtained in the thermodynamic limit @xmath62 ) . as @xmath0 continues to increase , the fraction of infinite polymers grows and the finite polymers get smaller so that @xmath51 decreases . as higher impurity concentrations hindrance",

    ", there is a certain range of values of @xmath2 where it is very probable that all free ends become frustrated ( and stop growing ) for a sufficiently large @xmath0 so that the polymer growth is finite again .",

    "it prevents such a free end to continue its growth linearly like a bifunctional monomer ( as occurs in the bpgm ) and consequently controls the relative incidence of branches .     versus @xmath0 for increasing values of @xmath2 in the abpgm ( @xmath39 and @xmath74).,width=226 ]",

    "we denote by @xmath76 the number of frustrated dead ends . for the bpgm , @xmath77 since any free end never stops . in order to measure the relative incidence of frustrated ends among those free sites _ chosen _ as trifunctional monomers , we define the _ frustration rate _ as    @xmath78    where the average is performed over _ all _ experiments . for infinite polymers , the current sites on the front of growth",

    "this behavior is explained as follows : for small @xmath4 , self - avoidance is reduced so that most sites trying to bifurcate succeed ; but as @xmath0 increases , parallel linear chains ( like those of figure 1a ) are forcibly generated due to both the increasing excluded volume and the clockwise update . for higher values of @xmath2 ,",
