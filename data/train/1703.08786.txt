    "over the past decade there has been a resurgence of interest within the electronic structure community in the inclusion of van der waals ( vdw ) dispersion forces in _ ab initio _ calculations . as a result",
    ", a plethora of new approaches has been developed@xcite that allow van der waals forces ( more generally implemented as potentials ) to be included alongside conventional density functional approximations@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental progress on `` non - additivity '' of van der waals interactions@xcite has also seen a more fundamental shift in thinking about van der waals forces and the role they play in nanomaterials .",
    "this reinvigorated interest in vdw forces has both parallelled and been driven by increasing interest in layered `` 2d '' materials which are held together almost exclusively by weak dispersion ( vdw ) forces .",
    "without accurate models of vdw forces it is very difficult to predict even qualitatively correct properties of such layered systems - including lattice parameters , binding energies and elastic moduli .",
    "thus the inclusion of vdw effects is vital for the modeling of layered structures ; and layered systems provide an important test of their accuracy@xcite .",
    "some of the more popular approaches for including vdw forces are that of tkatchenko and scheffler@xcite ( ts ) ; related many - body dispersion ( ts - mbd ) schemes@xcite ; and self - consistent screening@xcite ( ts - scs ) schemes .",
    "these approaches allow vdw forces to be included in calculations via a point - dipole model , with excellent numerical efficiency and generally good qualitative results .",
    "the methodology behind these approaches can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "pre - calculate @xmath1 coefficients and static dipole polarizabilities @xmath2 for isolated atoms using high - level electronic structure theory .",
    "approximate dipole polarizability properties of a molecule or material as a superposition of polarizabilities of free - atoms centered on their nuclei .",
    "3 .   use the free - atom properties , appropriately rescaled by the effective volume of embedded atoms , to calculate a model frequency dependent ( dynamic ) polarizability ( see sec.s1 in the supporting information@xcite ) .",
    "4 .   use the model polarizability to calculate the dispersion energy .",
    "this is done either by summing over pairwise contributions , as in the original ts theory@xcite , or by solving a many - body screening equation that includes non - additive terms , as in many - body approaches@xcite .",
    "the ts , ts - mbd and ts - scs schemes have shown great success in improving the qualitative and quantitative accuracy of _ ab initio _ calculations of many systems@xcite .",
    "this reflects their ability to capture type - a ( dobson - a ) and many - body dobson - b effects , according to the classificiation of dobson@xcite .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .   that the ts and ts - scs schemes may perform poorly for ionic systems , due to their use of _ atomic _ rather than _ ionic _ volumes . as a solution ,",
    "an alternative to stage  3 was proposed@xcite that accounts for rescaled ( via the ratio of the effective embedded volume to the free atom volume ) densities of _ ions _ , rather than pure atoms .",
    "this was found to improve results in many ionic systems .",
    "however , while the improvements from the ionic rescaling go some way to improving results for ionic materials , it still fails to capture the full ionic physics of the systems , leading e.g. to poor dipole polarizabilities of ionic systems .    in this work",
    "we will go further than ref .   and take into account the effect of both _",
    "ionic charge and volume _ on the effective static polarizabilities @xmath2 and @xmath1 coefficients of the system .",
    "more precisely , we will take into account the effect of the ionic charge on the frequency - dependent dipole polarizibilities , drawing from a recently published ionic polarizability dataset produced by two of the authors of the present work@xcite .",
    "our new method thus modifies stages  1 , 3 and 4 of ts - derived schemes ( _ vide supra _ ) by including : a ) ionic charge in the high - level calculations in stage  1 , via a new ionic polarizability dataset@xcite ; b ) ionic ( rather than atomic ) volume scaling of the polarizabilities in stage  3 , and c ) a more accurate model of frequency - dependent polarizabilities in stages  3 and  4 .",
    "we will first develop a theory of embedded fractional ions by : i ) showing how a dataset of _ integer _ ions can be used to generate _",
    "fractional _ ions ; ii ) introducing a `` remapping '' correction to the mbd equations that corrects for rare , but sizeable , unphysical interactions in some materials .",
    "we will finally show that the explicit inclusion of fractional charge in the point - dipole model substantially improves results in various systems , especially in ionic ones .",
    "our new scheme is particularly important for ionic layered transition metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) systems , like mos@xmath0 where other schemes perform very poorly . in these systems",
    "the ionic scheme gives results on a par with sophisticated electron structure calculations using random - phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite .",
    "our new scheme is closely related to the work of tkatchenko and co - workers@xcite , as improved by buko _ _ et al__@xcite .",
    "notably , it employs the same iterative hirshfeld partitioning and the same effective volume scaling as ref .  .",
    "however , it _ differs crucially _ through the polarizability model it employs , because it incorporates fractionally ionic effects and uses a significantly improved screening .",
    "the new recipe thus becomes :    1 .",
    "pre - calculate dipole polarizabilities not only for free atoms , but also for non - interacting _ free ions _ using high - level electronic structure theory .",
    "2 .   approximate the dipole polarizability properties of a molecule or a material via non - interacting _ free - ion _ polarizabilities centered on the nuclei .",
    "3 .   use the free - ion polarizabilities to obtain _ fractional ionic ( fi ) _ polarizabilities @xmath3 , evaluated at the _ fractional _ electron number @xmath4 , and rescaled by the effective volume of the embedded charge , to calculate the effective fractional ionic polarizabilities ( see sec.s1 in the supporting information@xcite for further details ) : @xmath5 4 .   use the effective ,",
    "fractional ionic embedded polarizabilities distributed on the atomic sites to calculate the dispersion energy , either using the additive or many - body method with eigenvalue remapping ( discussed later ) .",
    "these items are treated in detail over the following sections .",
    "we first introduce the fractional ionic scheme [ sec .",
    "[ ssec : frac ] ] ; we then discuss the polarizability model used in the fractional ionic scheme [ sec .",
    "[ ssec : model ] ] ; and we finally explain a `` remapping '' scheme that ensures that the energy and forces behave reasonably even for some of the systems where the original scheme fails [ sec .",
    "[ ssec : rescale ] ] .      before introducing the details of the new method",
    ", we should first discuss here what is meant by `` fractional ions '' . in an embedded system",
    "this concept is fairly well defined , at least within partitioning schemes such as bader  @xcite , hirshfeld  @xcite , or iterative hirshfeld  @xcite atoms - in - molecules ( aim ) approaches : the `` fractional ion '' is defined as a sub - system of a larger molecule or material with an integral nuclear charge @xmath6 and a non - integer number of electrons @xmath7 , whose overall charge @xmath8 is thus non - integral in general .",
    "this is related to a representative free fractional ion with equal non - integer charge .",
    "the use of fractional ions raises interesting fundamental questions , whilst offering significant practical improvements .",
    "we thus dedicate the following part of this section to discuss the nature and practical consequences of using such fractional ions .",
    "any isolated system with non - integer electron number must be treated via a quantum state ensemble composed of wave functions with different integer electron numbers .",
    "this applies at the fully interacting and density functional theory levels@xcite . in an isolated _ atomic - like _ system , such as the interaction - free fractional ions that we will use , these states",
    "will all share the same form of nuclear potential @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , at low temperatures , the ensemble of non - interacting free ions with non - integer @xmath7 electrons will be formed only from states with @xmath10 and @xmath11 electrons ( i.e.  the largest integer smaller and the smallest integer larger than @xmath7 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "many ground state properties of such systems obey the well - established piecewise linear relationship@xcite @xmath12 examples include the energy @xmath13 , electron density @xmath14 , and atomic kinetic energy @xmath15@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 coefficient is not one of those properties .",
    "however , we will argue below that the dipole polarizability at non - integer @xmath7 _ is _ piecewise linear and thus does obey eq .  .",
    "if we then assume that the usual casimir - polder formula @xmath16 holds for fractional ions , this gives us a recipe for calculating @xmath1 coefficients in terms of the imaginary frequency polarizabilities @xmath17({{\\boldsymbol{r}}},{{\\boldsymbol{r}}{^{\\prime}}};i\\omega ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath18({{\\boldsymbol{r}}},{{\\boldsymbol{r}}{^{\\prime}}};i\\omega)$ ] is the density response of an @xmath7 electron atom ( where @xmath7 can be non - integer ) in potential @xmath19 .",
    "our argument is as follows : by definition of the density response @xmath20 , we know that @xmath7 electrons ( kept fixed ) in a potential @xmath21 with @xmath22 have a density @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the density with @xmath25 . in the case of a non - integer electron number ensemble",
    "we further know that the density @xmath26 is piecewise linear between the electron densities of the adjacent integer systems .",
    "but eq .   must hold also for any infinitesimally small change ( at least at zero frequency , but most likely at finite frequency too@xcite ) to the potential , provided we assume that symmetries are preserved or are correctly accounted for in any approximations employed .",
    "thus we see also @xmath27 and if @xmath28 is piecewise linear and @xmath29 is piecewise linear , it directly follows that the density response @xmath30 must be piecewise linear too , since @xmath31 . finally , using eq .  , we see that @xmath32 that is , the polarizability is piecewise linear in the electron number .",
    "this means that we only need to calculate polarizabilities for integer numbers of electrons , and interpolate to find the remaining fractional ionic values .",
    "this ability to interpolate from integer cases to non - integer cases is crucial for the success of our method as it keeps the amount of external data sourced from high - level calculations at a manageable size .      in the original work of tkatchenko and scheffler  @xcite",
    ", a simple relationship @xmath33 was assumed between the frequency dependent dipole polarizability , the @xmath1 coefficient and the static dipole polarizability of the isolated atom .",
    "this approximation is based on a one - pole model of the polarizability of an isolated atom , with @xmath34 set consistent with eq .  .",
    "in the present work we can no longer rely on eq .   due to the use of linear combinations of polarizabilities , each with a different value of @xmath34 . rather than generalizing eq .",
    ", we instead use the two - pole parameterizations of frequency dependent atomic and ionic polarizabilities recently published by two of us@xcite .",
    "these models are then combined , as per the piecewise linear formula , into a four - pole model for the fractional ions .",
    "this allows us to improve the accuracy of the integer atomic polarizabilities and ensure that our fractional ions are treated correctly .    for each atom and ion with integer electron number @xmath35",
    "we thus employ a polarizability model @xmath36 involving two lorentzian functions .",
    "then , using the piecewise linearity of @xmath37 , we extend this to arbitrary non - integer electron number @xmath7 using @xmath38 here we use the properties of systems with neighbouring integer electron numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and then linearly interpolate using the remaining fractional charge @xmath41 .",
    "the final model thus employs four lorentzian functions .",
    "the values of parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 used in this work are available for neutral atoms and ions of elements from the first six rows of periodic table in the supporting information of ref .  .",
    "finally , we can perform all integrals analytically in eq .   to derive the @xmath1 coefficient ( if needed ) between two fractionally charged ions @xmath44 and @xmath45 in terms of our pretabulated coefficients . alternatively , in the case of the many - body theory the direct calculation of @xmath1 is unnecessary , and instead we can use eq .   directly .",
    "free - standing ions can be very different to ions embedded in a larger system such as a molecule or a material .",
    "for example , the surrounding environment of an anion has a substantial effect on its outermost electron(s ) .",
    "they are only very weakly bound in the free - standing case , with an asymptotic effective potential going to zero as @xmath46 .",
    "when embedded , the presence of other electrons and nuclei should be represented by an effective confining potential , which can be approximated by a positive power law function of @xmath47 such as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an effective embedding radius and @xmath50 governs the sharpness of the embedding .",
    "the same electrons that are the most sensitive to the embedding environment , namely electrons in the outermost electronic shell(s ) , are the ones that contribute the most to the polarizability .",
    "thus the polarizability of an embedded system is highly sensitive to its environment and care must be taken in considering what `` ions '' we use in our high - level fractional ionic calculations .",
    "this is particularly pertinent for open shell systems which are likely to be the most sensitive to the environment .    to this end",
    "we use the model polarizabilities from the `` minimal chemistry '' database of ref .  .",
    "this provides _ ab initio _ dynamic polarizabilities for the first 6 rows of the periodic table that are specifically tailored to provide chemically plausible free anions , calculated as a combination of ensemble dft@xcite and time - dependent dft@xcite .",
    "it also allows for the evaluation of double anions , which are problematic in a self - consistent scheme . in short ,",
    "self - consistent results are included for neutral atoms , cations , and closed shell monoanions ; while non self - consistent data ( based on the relevant neutral atom ) is provided for the remaining anions .",
    "variants of the mbd method involve ( see e.g. discussion in refs .  ) the solution of the screening equation @xmath51\\ }    \\label{eqn : edispatlr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain dispersion energies . here",
    "@xmath52 is an atom - wise model of the dipole polarizability in the system which differs only in some details between different schemes ( like mbd@rsscs , and the new mbd@rsscs / fi model introduced here ) , and @xmath53 is the ( long - range ) dipole interaction tensor .",
    "calculations thus involve a tractable @xmath54 matrix equation , where @xmath55 is the number of atoms / ions in the system . in the case of a periodic system",
    "@xmath55 is the number of atoms / ions in the unit cell and we must also include a sum over @xmath56 points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "full details of ts - mbd variants , including the generalization of eq .   to periodic systems , can be found in ref .  .",

    "in these systems long - range and low - frequency dipole coupling can lead to some values of @xmath73 becoming less than @xmath80 due to inconsistencies in the _ model _ polarizability and screening equations .",
    "this problem is related to the well - known phenomenon of `` polarization catastrophe ''  @xcite and occurs when atoms are too close together - rendering the taylor expansion of the coulomb potential unstable .    to solve the system of self - consistent screening equations in these pathological cases we need to fix these unphysical eigenvalues . given the success of mbd in many systems , this fix must maintain its good properties in typical cases , but improve on it in the pathological cases .",
    "our solution involves `` remapping '' the eigenvalues of the system to avoid unphysical cases whilst maintaining continuity in energy and forces with respect to changes in the geometry .",

    "to expectation , the predicted properties of na and cl embedded in the interacting systems are more similar to those of neutral atoms than to those of ions .    in this case , the pairwise tkatchenko - scheffler method based on neutral atoms  @xcite leads to a strong overestimation of interaction between atoms in nacl and a strong underestimation of the lattice constant [ 5.34  ( ts ) vs. 5.57  ( exp.)]@xcite .",
    "the consequences for the mbd@rsscs scheme based on the same polarizability model are even more serious : the method suffers from numerical issues ( already discussed in sec .",

    "the computed results presented in tab .  [ tab : bulklayered ] are qualitatively consistent with our results for bilayers and the mbd@rsscs / fi results are reasonably close to the rpa reference . the standard mbd@rsscs method has the same numerical issues ( from the polarization catastrophe ) as in the case of bilayers . we thus can not calculate or report meaningful results from it .      in fluoride derivative of graphite , the fluorine atoms are covalently bound to carbon atoms , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cfstruct ] . in this work",
    "we use the mbd@rsscs approach to compute binding energy for the structure with the aa stacking of layers which has recently been identified as the most stable structural arrangement for this material  @xcite .",

    "before concluding , we discuss a few limitations of our fi approach which warrant study in future works . many of these limitations are shared by other van der waals functionals .",
    "firstly , the fi approach neglects quadropolar and higher order van der waals terms .",
    "this can possibly be remedied by approximating these terms@xcite or pre - calculating them directly in higher level theory as in ref .  .",
    "however , we note that in layered geometries the higher order contributions appear to be heavily screened in the near - contact regime@xcite , perhaps explaining the success of methods which neglect them .",
    "secondly , the lack of long - range fluctuations in the scheme means it can not properly capture dobson - c@xcite effects , a property it inherits from the mbd scheme .",
    "this is likely to be important in long - range forces from metallic systems@xcite and systems with unusual topological properties@xcite .",
    "however , there is some evidence ( e.g.  @xcite ) that some of these effects might be captured via the coupled fluctuating dipole model s inclusion of dobson - b terms , at least in the medium range .",
    "finally , the eigenvalue remapping scheme is somewhat _",
    "ad hoc_. further testing of how the polarization catastrophe behaves in exemplar ( non - remapped ) systems should shed light on how to include more physically intuitive corrections .",
    "work in this direction is being pursued .",
    "in this work we introduced a scheme ( mbd@rsscs / fi ) for calculating polarizabilities and dispersion forces in electronic systems .",
    "our approach uses the properties of _ fractional ions _ ( fis ) in a point - dipole dispersion approximation based on the mbd approach .",
    "key equations describing our approach are given in eqs .",
    "[ eqn : alphats2 ] , [ eqn : alpha ] and [ eqn : ereqn ] , and related discussion .",
    "our fractional ionic approach vastly improves results for ionic systems in bulk and layered materials , compared to related approaches@xcite .",
    "it is particularly successful in transition - metal dichalcogenides like mos@xmath0 , and in interactions of h@xmath0 with modified coronenes , systems of nanotechnological interest .",
    "it marginally outperforms similar schemes in most of the non - ionic system sets tested , and is of only marginally lower accuracy in the remainder .",
    "our approach is thus a suitable alternative to existing schemes in systems where they work , while offering substantial improvements in ionic systems where they do not .",

    "<S> by explicitly including _ fractionally ionic _ contributions to the polarizability of a many - component system we are able to significantly improve on previous atom - wise many - body van der waals approaches with essentially no extra numerical cost . for non - ionic systems our method is comparable in accuracy to existing approaches . </S>",
    "<S> however , it offers substantial improvements in ionic solids , e.g. producing better polarizabilities by over 65% in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> it has particular benefits for two - dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides , and interactions of h@xmath0 with modified coronenes - ionic systems of nanotechnological interest . </S>",
    "<S> it thus offers an efficient improvement on existing approaches , valid for a wide range of systems . </S>"
