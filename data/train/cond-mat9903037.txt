    "during the past 15 years an increasing interest in two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnets has developed .",
    "this is a result of ( i ) the investigation of a wide class of well - characterized quasi-2d magnetic materials which allow a detailed experimental study of their properties ( inelastic neutron scattering , nuclear magnetic resonance , etc . ) , and ( ii ) the availability of high - speed computers with the capabilities for simulations on large lattices .",
    "examples of these materials are ( 1 ) layered magnets @xcite , like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; ( 2 ) @xmath7 graphite intercalation compounds @xcite , ( 3 ) magnetic lipid layers @xcite , like @xmath8 . for the first class of these examples",
    "the ratio of inter- to intraplane magnetic coupling constants is typically @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the behavior is nearly two - dimensional as concerns the magnetic properties . for the second class ,",
    "the above ratio of the coupling constants can be tuned by choosing the number of intercalated graphite layers . for the third class ,",
    "even monolayers can be produced , using the langmuir - blodgett method .",
    "many of the above materials have an  easy - plane  or @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "this means that the spins prefer to be oriented in the @xmath0-plane which is defined as the plane in which the magnetic ions are situated .",
    "the simplest model for this symmetry is the 2d classical anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath11\\,.\\ ] ] @xmath12 labels nearest neighbors of a 2d lattice ; usually a square lattice is used .",
    "the subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for the components of the classical spin vector @xmath15 ; the spin length @xmath16 is set to unity by the redefinition @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the magnetic coupling constant , both ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials were investigated .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath19 lies in the range @xmath20 ; note that @xmath21 corresponds to the @xmath0-model , not to the so - called planar model where the spins are strictly confined to the @xmath0-plane ; this confinement is possible only if one is not interested in the dynamics . instead of",
    "the exchange anisotropy in the hamiltonian ( [ h = j ] ) , one can also use an on - site anisotropy term @xmath22 , which yields similar results .",
    "there are two kinds of excitations : spin waves which are solutions of the linearized equations of motion , and vortices which are topological collective structures .",
    "the vortices are responsible for a topological phase transition @xcite at the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath23 .",
    "below @xmath24 , vortex - antivortex pairs are thermally excited and destroyed ; above @xmath23 these bound pairs dissociate and the density of free vortices increases with temperature .",
    "it must be noted that an order - disorder phase transition is not possible according to the mermin - wagner - theorem @xcite ; the reason is that all long - range order is destroyed by the long - wave linear excitations in all 1d and 2d models with continuous symmetries .",
    "both theory @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite showed that @xmath23 is only very weakly dependent on the anisotropy @xmath19 , except for @xmath19 extremely close to @xmath25 , when @xmath26 .",
    "for the materials mentioned above , coupling constants were estimated from fits to spin - wave theory , and @xmath19 values are in the range @xmath27 , where @xmath23 is still close to its value for @xmath21 .",
    "however , the out - of - plane structure of the vortices ( i.  e. , the structure of the @xmath28 components ) depends crucially on @xmath19 , while the in - plane structure ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 components ) remains the same @xcite . for @xmath31 for a square lattice @xcite ) ,",
    "static vortices have null @xmath28 components , they are termed  in - plane  or planar vortices in the literature . for @xmath32",
    "there are  out - of - plane  or  non - planar  vortices which exhibit a localized structure of the @xmath28 components around the vortex center .",
    "this structure falls off exponentially with a characteristic length , the vortex core radius @xcite @xmath33 in units of the lattice constant @xmath34 . the core radius increases with diminishing @xmath19 , allowing a continuous crossover to the isotropic heisenberg model ( @xmath35 ) where the topological excitations are merons and instantons @xcite , rather than vortices .",
    "compared to the vortices in classical fluids @xcite and superfluids @xcite , there is an important difference : the vortices of the easy - plane heisenberg model carry _ two _ topological charges , instead of one : ( 1 ) the vorticity @xmath36 which is defined in the usual way : the sum of changes of the azimuthal angle @xmath37 on an arbitrary closed contour around the vortex center yields @xmath38 ; if the center is not inside the contour the sum is zero . in the following only the cases @xmath39 ( vortex ) and @xmath40 ( antivortex ) will be considered , the cases @xmath41 would be relevant only for high temperatures .",
    "( 2 ) the polarization or polarity @xmath42 : for the non - planar vortices @xmath43 indicates to which side of the @xmath0-plane the out - of - plane structure points , while @xmath44 for the planar vortices ( fig .",
    "[ vortexstruct ] ) .        both topological charges and @xmath45",
    "are @xmath46- and @xmath47-topological charges , respectively ; see ref .",
    "@xcite . ] are crucial for the vortex dynamics , which is governed by two different forces : ( 1 ) 2d coulomb - type forces @xmath48 , which are proportional to the product of the vorticities of two vortices and inversely proportional to their distance ( assuming that the distance is larger than @xmath49 , such that the out - of - plane structures do not overlap ) , ( 2 ) a  gyrocoupling  force @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the vortex velocity , and @xmath52 is the trajectory of the vortex center .    the force ( [ fg = x ] ) is formally equivalent to the magnus force in fluid dynamics and to the lorentz force on an electric charge .",
    "the gyrocoupling vector @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the unit vector in @xmath14-direction , does not represent an external field but is an intrinsic quantity , namely a kind of self - induced magnetic field which is produced by the localized @xmath28-structure and carried along by the vortex . for antiferromagnets",
    "@xmath55 vanishes .",
    "since the gyrovector ( [ g=2 ] ) contains the product of both topological charges , the dynamics of the two kinds of vortices is completely different : + ( 1 ) for planar vortices @xmath56 , therefore they have a newtonian dynamics @xmath57 where the vortex mass @xmath58 will be defined in section 2.2 .",
    "however , in the simulations the trajectories are not smooth due to strong discreteness effects @xcite .",
    "+ ( 2 ) non - planar vortices have smooth trajectories if the diameter @xmath59 of the out - of - plane structure is considerably larger than the lattice constant @xcite ; i.  e. , if @xmath19 is not close to @xmath60 . for steady state motion ,",
    "the dynamics is described by the thiele equation @xcite @xmath61 which was derived from the landau - lifshitz equation ( section 2 ) for the spin vector @xmath62 .",
    "this equation is identical to hamilton s equations with hamiltonian ( 1.1 ) .",
    "however , for arbitrary motion the thiele equation ( 1.5 ) is only an approximation because a rigid vortex shape was assumed in the derivation .",
    "if a velocity dependence of the shape is allowed @xcite , an inertial term @xmath63 appears on the l.  h.  s.  of eq .",
    "( [ xxg ] ) .",
    "however , this @xmath64-order equation could not be confirmed by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the reason will be discussed in section 2 ; in fact , a collective variable theory reveals that the dynamics of non - planar vortices can only be described by odd - order equations of motion .",
    "therefore the dynamics is _ non - newtonian_.    another interesting topic is the dynamics under the influence of thermal fluctuations ( section 3 ) . here",
    "white noise and damping are implemented in the landau - lifshitz equation .",
    "the same type of collective variable theory as in section 2 then yields stochastic equations of motion for the vortices .",
    "the stochastic forces on the vortices can be calculated and the solutions of the equations of motion are compared with langevin dynamics simulations . in this way , the diffusive vortex motion can be well understood .    for somewhat higher temperatures ( still below @xmath23 ) the thermal noise can induce transitions of non - planar vortices from one polarization to the opposite one .",
    "theoretical estimates of the transition rate are compared with langevin dynamics simulations ( section [ polartrans ] ) .",
    "for the temperature range above @xmath23 , so far only a phenomenological theory exists , the vortex - gas approach ( section  [ tempgtkt ] ) .",
    "it contains only two free parameters ( the density of free vortices and their r.m.s .",
    "velocity ) .",
    "the theory predicts  central peaks  in the dynamic form factors for both in - plane and out - of - plane spin correlations .",
    "such peaks are observed both in computer simulations and in inelastic neutron scattering experiments , and many of the predicted features are confirmed .",
    "however , a recent _ direct _ observation of the vortex motion in monte carlo simulations has revealed that a basic assumption of the theory , namely a _",
    "ballistic _ vortex motion , might not be valid .",
    "( in section [ tempgtkt ] we confine ourselves to the ferromagnetic case , although easy - plane antiferromagnets were also investigated ) .",
    "the spin dynamics is given by the landau - lifshitz equation , which is the classical limit of the heisenberg equation of motion for the spin operator @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the hamiltonian , in our case that of the anisotropic heisenberg model ( [ h = j ] ) .",
    "the meaning of eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) is that the spin vector @xmath65 precesses in a local magnetic field @xmath68 , with cartesian components @xmath69 . in spin dynamics simulations ( see below ) , the landau - lifshitz equation is integrated numerically for a large square lattice , typically with @xmath70 lattice points .",
    "as initial condition a vortex is placed on the lattice and the trajectory @xmath71 of the vortex center is monitored .",
    "this trajectory is then compared with theory , i.  e.  with the solution of an equation of motion for the vortex .",
    "the standard procedure to obtain this equation consists in taking the continuum limit @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a vector in the @xmath0 plane , and in developing a _ collective variable theory_. the simplest version makes the travelling wave ansatz @xcite @xmath74 where the functions @xmath75 on the r.  h.  s.  describe the vortex shape .",
    "( strictly speaking , these functions should bear an index to distinguish them from the functions on the l.  h.  s. )    as the equation of motion is expected to contain a force , the following operations are performed with eq .",

    "@xmath79 is inserted , with summation over repeated indices .",
    "integration over @xmath73 then yields the equation of motion @xmath80 with the force @xmath81 and the gyrocoupling tensor @xmath82 the expression on the right was obtained by introducing the two canonical fields @xmath83 instead of the three spin components @xmath75 with the constraint @xmath84 .",

    "interestingly , only the value @xmath42 of the @xmath28 component at the vortex _ center _ enters the final result @xcite , i.  e. , the out - of - plane vortex structure needs not to be explicitly known here .",
    "as @xmath55 is antisymmetric , eq .  ( [ gx = f ] ) is identical to the thiele equation ( [ xxg ] ) with gyrovector @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath44 and thus @xmath92 for planar vortices , the thiele equation is incomplete in this case . obviously there must be a non - vanishing term on the l.  h.  s. , this will be an inertial term ( section [ vortexmass ] ) .",
    "moreover , the ansatz ( [ srt ] ) , and thus the thiele equation , is only valid for steady - state motion when the vortex shape is rigid ( in the moving frame ) .",
    "this includes not only translational motion with constant velocity @xmath93 but also rotational motion with constant angular velocity @xmath94 .",
    "both types of motion can be obtained by considering  two non - planar vortices at a distance @xmath95 which drive each other by their coulomb force @xmath96 . for a certain velocity",
    "this force is compensated by the gyrocoupling force ( [ fg = x ] ) .",
    "in fact , since each vortex carries two charges , there are four physically different scenarios which represent stationary solutions of the thiele equation .",
    "they fall into two classes : if the gyrovectors of the two vortices are parallel ( i. e. , @xmath97 ) , a vortex - vortex or vortex - antivortex pair rotates with @xmath94 on a circle with radius @xmath98 around each other , where @xmath99 if the gyrovectors are antiparallel , the pair performs a parallel translational motion with velocity @xmath93 and distance @xmath95 , where @xmath100",
    ".    both kinds of scenarios also appear for vortices in ( super)fluids @xcite .",
    "however , in these contexts there are only two physically different situations : vortex - vortex rotation and vortex - antivortex translation .",
    "the above scenarios for magnetic vortices were not tested by computer simulations until 1994 , and the results were very surprising @xcite : using a square or circular system with free boundary conditions , two of the four scenarios ( vortex - vortex rotation and vortex - antivortex translation ) were confirmed , but not the two other ones : for vortex - antivortex rotation and vortex - vortex translation the observed trajectories showed pronounced oscillations around the trajectories predicted by the thiele equation ( [ xxg ] ) or ( [ gx = f ] ) , see fig .  [ trajectory ] .",
    "in fact , such oscillations had already been predicted @xcite by assuming that the vortex shape in the travelling wave ansatz ( [ srt ] ) depends explicitely on the velocity @xmath101 .",
    "this leads to an additional term @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ ds / dt ] ) and thus to an inertial term in the thiele equation @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the mass tensor @xmath105 this integral can be easily evaluated if the vortex is placed at the center of a circular system with radius @xmath106 and free boundary conditions .",
    "the dominant contribution stems from the outer region @xmath107 , with @xmath108 , where the velocity dependent parts of the vortex structure are @xcite @xmath109 @xmath110 together with the static parts @xmath111 from eq .",
    "( [ phi = q ] ) and @xmath112 , which falls off exponentially outside the core ( [ rv=1/2 ] ) , the rest mass @xmath58 is obtained @xmath113 the constant @xmath114 stems from the inner region @xmath115 , where the vortex structure is not well known due to the discreteness , but @xmath114 is not important for discussion .",
    "there is also a velocity dependent contribution to the mass which is negligible because the vortex velocities in the simulations are always much smaller than the spin wave velocity , which is the only characteristic velocity of the system .",
    "the above vortex mass is consistent with other results in the literature : generalizing the momentum of solitons in 1d magnets @xcite , the vortex momentum @xmath116 is defined and can be shown to be a generator of translations @xcite",
    ". then @xmath117 results , but @xmath118 is not a canonical momentum because the poisson bracket @xmath119 does not vanish . for the kinetic energy @xmath120",
    "is obtained @xcite , therefore this energy and the rest energy @xmath121 both show the same logarithmic dependence on the system size @xmath106 .    for a continuum model of a 2d ferromagnet with uniaxial symmetry and a magnetostatic field ,",
    "a slightly different vortex momentum was defined @xcite , namely @xmath122 where @xmath123 represents the gyrovector density , cf .",
    "( [ eq : gij ] ) which is related to the gyrovector as described below eq .",
    "( [ gij2 ] ) .",
    "the definition ( [ ppt ] ) depends on the choice of origin of the system and is not a generator of translations .",
    "nevertheless , if the time derivative of @xmath124 is set equal to the force @xmath48 on the vortex , the generalized thiele equation ( [ mx = gx ] ) is again obtained @xcite . therefore the vortex dynamics is qualitatively the same , as will be discussed now .",
    "( [ mx = gx ] ) has the same form as that for an electric charge @xmath125 in a plane with a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath126 and an in - plane electric field @xmath127 .",
    "i.  e. , the vortex motion is completely analogous to the hall effect : the trajectory is a cycloid with frequency @xmath128 cf .",
    "the cyclotron frequency @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the speed of light .",
    "it is possible to transform to a frame where the force @xmath131 vanishes and the vortex rotates ( i.  e. , guiding center coordinates @xcite ) .",

    "[ trajectory ] ) . moreover",
    ", the fact that oscillations are observed only for two of the four scenarios for two vortices ( see above ) can also be explained : a generalization of the ansatz ( [ srt ] ) to the case of two vortices yields two coupled equations of motion with a 2-vortex mass tensor @xcite . in the case of vortex - vortex rotation and vortex - antivortex translation",
    "there are cancellations in this mass tensor which prevent oscillations , in agreement with the simulations .    however , a _ quantitative _ comparison of eq .",

    "[ fourierspec ] ) . as @xmath135 and @xmath136",
    "are close to each other , a pronounced beat is observed in the trajectories ( fig .",
    "[ trajectory ] ) : the cycloidal frequency is @xmath137 , but the shape of the cycloids changes slowly with @xmath138 .",
    "both discrepancies have nothing to do with 2-vortex effects , because they also occur in 1-vortex simulations @xcite . here",
    "the vortex is driven by image forces , in analogy to electrostatics .",
    "the most convenient geometry is a circular system with radius @xmath106 and free boundaries . in this case",
    "there is only one image vortex which has opposite vorticity , but the same polarization @xcite . the radial coordinate of the image is @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the vortex coordinate .",
    "the vortex trajectory can be fitted very well to a superposition of two cycloids .",
    "this observation will be explained in the next section .",
    "recently a very general collective variable theory was developed for nonlinear coherent excitations in classical systems with _",

    " gyrotropic ",
    "excitations are governed by odd - order equations and thus do not have newtonian dynamics , e.  g.  galileo s law is not valid .  non - gyrotropic  excitations are so - to - speak the normal case , because they are described by even - order equations , i.  e.  by newton s equation in the first approximation",
    ".    examples of the latter class are kinks in 1d models like the nonlinear klein - gordon family and the planar vortices of the 2d anisotropic heisenberg model ( [ h = j ] ) .",

    "the dynamic in - plane structures @xmath156 and @xmath157 can not be clearly observed because it is difficult to subtract the static structure @xmath111 which varies drastically with the vortex position .",

    "as @xmath159 and @xmath157 depend linearly on @xmath161 and as @xmath151 contains derivatives with respect to @xmath161 , the leading contribution to @xmath151 is independent of velocity and acceleration .",

    "based on earlier work , this concept has very recently been carried through @xcite .",

    "analytical investigations were done for planar vortices in antiferromagnets @xcite and ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "these articles demonstrated nontrivial properties of the eigenmodes , e.  g. , the presence of quasi - local ( resonance type ) @xcite or truly local @xcite modes .",
    "moreover , the relevance of these modes for the vortex dynamics was shown , in particular the transition between planar and non - planar vortices was investigated @xcite .",
    "however , for non - planar vortices all this was based on numerical diagonalization .",
    "but very recently , a general theory of vortex - magnon coupling was developed for arbitrarily large systems with circular symmetry and general bc @xcite .",

    "there is a very good agreement between the frequencies of the two lowest quasi - local modes and the frequencies @xmath134 , which were observed for the vortex trajectories in spin dynamics simulations for the discrete system ( section ( [ vortexmass ] ) .",
    "the error is only 0.8 % for the mean frequency @xmath193 and 4 % for the splitting @xmath194 .",
    "this demonstrates very clearly that the _ cycloidal vortex motion _ is accompanied by certain magnon modes , namely by _ quasi - local modes_. these modes are both extended ( like the other magnon modes ) and local , because they exhibit a localized structure around the vortex center ( fig .",

    "this offers the possibility to develop an ab - initio theory for the dynamic form factors .",
    "this can be compared with the phenomenological vortex gas approach , which assumes , however , a ballistic motion ( section  [ tempgtkt ] ) .      in principle , the generalization of a collective variable theory to finite temperatures is a straightforward procedure consisting of 4 steps : + ( 1 ) thermal noise and damping ( because of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) are introduced into the microscopic equations .",

    "both major problems have been investigated in a preprint @xcite : additive noise in the hamilton equations yields a vortex diffusion constant @xmath219 which depends _ logarithmically _ on the system size , while in the multiplicative case @xmath219 is _ independent _ of the system size .",
    "additive noise in the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite yields a diffusion constant with the same logarithmic term as in the case of additive noise in the hamilton equations , but the small constants that appear in addition to the logarithmic term differ for the two cases because the vortex core gives different contributions .",
    "unfortunately , the additive noise in the landau - lifshitz equation has an unphysical feature , namely the spin length is not conserved . in the collective variable theory",
    "this problem is overcome by a constraint , while in the simulations a renormalization of the spin length is necessary after every time step .",
    "however , taking additive noise and using these little tricks is not really necessary , because there is a better noise term which eventually leads to the same results , but which is well motivated on physical grounds and which conserves the spin length @xcite : in the landau - lifshitz equation ( [ ds ] ) each spin @xmath65 precesses in a local magnetic field @xmath126 which is the gradient of the energy with respect to the spin compononts .",
    "this local field is the only way through which the spin @xmath65 can feel any changes in its environment . adding a thermal noise term to the local field thus accounts for the interaction of the spin with magnons , phonons and any other thermally generated excitations .",

    "this procedure eventually produces only a renormalization of the damping parameter @xmath224 in the order of @xmath226 . in the simulations values of @xmath224 in the order of @xmath9",

    "\\(2 ) _ out - of - plane correlations _ : in mc - sd simulations , @xmath315 exhibits a central peak only together with a spin wave peak which sits on its shoulder ( in contrast to @xmath316 where the spin waves are strongly softened for small @xmath265 ) .    for the xy - model ( @xmath303 ) , which bears planar vortices ,",
    "the intensity of the central peak is expected to be small ( see end of section [ vortexgas ] ) .",
    "early simulations with large statistical errors @xcite had difficulties to substract the spin wave peak and reported only upper bounds for the width @xmath317 and the intensity @xmath318 of the central peak .",
    "recent simulations with much better statistics investigated the range @xmath319 .",
    "some papers did not find a central peak @xcite others did @xcite .",
    "however , for the weakly anisotropic case ( @xmath304 ) with non - planar vortices a central peak was indeed found @xcite .",
    "experimentally , @xmath315 was first not accessible because of intensity problems .",
    "only the use of spin - polarized neutron beams made it possible to observe a central peak in @xmath320 and to distinguish it from the spin wave peak and from other contributions @xcite .",
    "the measured width is practically equal to the width of the gaussian ( [ szz ] ) .",
    "however , such a good agreement seems to be accidental because this material exhibits a breaking of the rotational symmetry in the xy - plane which is described by a more complicated hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "for the same reason it is not clear whether this material actually belongs to the case @xmath304 .",
    "the vortex gas approach assumes for single free vortices a diffusive @xcite or ballistic @xcite motion .",
    "very recently this was tested in mc - simulations by monitoring the position of each vortex in the system ( free or bound in a pair ) as a function of time @xcite .",
    "the surprising result is that a single vortex very seldom moves freely over a larger distance .",
    "normally the vortex travels only one or a few lattice spacings until it annihilates with the antivortex of a pair which meanwhile appeared spontaneously in the neighborhood .",
    "another possibility is that the single vortex docks on a pair or a cluster of pairs and after a while one of the vortices leaves the cluster .",
    "these results confirm suggestions that vortices can not move freely for more than a few lattice spacings , which were made by computing the vortex density - density correlation function @xcite .    however , the interpretation of these results is not clear at all .",
    "one possibility is that the vortex gas approach is not valid @xcite , but then the striking qualitative agreement with the central peaks in the simulations and experiments is not understood .",
    "we favour another possibility : probably only the _ effective _ vortex motion is important for the dynamic correlation function @xmath321 ( [ spinspincorr ] ) .",
    "this would mean that it does not matter if a vortex is annihilated with the antivortex of a pair in the considered time interval @xmath322 $ ] , because the vortex of that pair continues the travel instead of the original vortex .",
    "only effective lifetimes are seriously affected .",
    "this picture is strongly supported by the mechanism @xcite which yields the central peak @xmath323 in eq .",
    "( [ sxx ] ) : looking at the orientation of one particular spin in the xy - plane , one sees that its direction is _ reversed _ after the vortex center has gone over this spin or its neighborhood .",
    "thus @xmath29 and @xmath30 have _ changed their signs _ after the vortex is gone , and therefore @xmath324 here @xmath325 is the number of vortices which pass an arbitrary nonintersecting contour connecting @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",
    "obviously , it does not matter if those vortices are replaced by other vortices during their travel ( except maybe if the replacement happens just when the contour is passed ) .",
    "the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ sxx=-1^n ] ) leads to the central peak ( [ sxx ] ) @xcite .",
    "the vortex dynamics at zero temperature can be well understood by a collective variable theory : a generalized travelling wave ansatz which allows for deformations of the vortex shape due to velocity , acceleration etc .",
    ", leads to equations of motion . in the case of non - planar vortices ,",
    "the trajectories exhibit a superposition of cycloids which is fully confirmed by spin dynamics simulations .",
    "this collective variable theory can be generalized to finite temperatures which yields stochastic equations of motion .",
    "the vortex motion is diffusive and agrees well with langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "moreover , the rate of noise - induced transitions between vortex states with opposite polarization is calculated and agrees with the simulations .",
    "however , above the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature there is so far no theory which can fully explain the central peaks which were observed both in inelastic neutron scattering experiments and in combined monte - carlo and spin dynamics simulations .",
    "a qualitative agreement is achieved by a phenomenological vortex gas theory , but one of its assumptions , namely ballistic vortex motion , is questionable .",
    "probably , both the diffusive character of the vortex motion and annihilation and creation processes must be incorporated into a theory which can fully explain the above facts .",
    "it is likely that the situation is similar for all kosterlitz - thouless ( and many other ) phase transitions .",
