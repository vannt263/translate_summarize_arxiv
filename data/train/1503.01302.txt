    "we consider the asymptotic limit @xmath0 of the first discrete painlev equation ( dp@xmath1 ) @xmath2 and apply methods of exponential asymptotics to describe solutions which demonstrate asymptotically pole - free behaviour within certain sectors .",
    "this nonlinear equation also appears in the study of orthogonal polynomials , known there as the freud equation @xcite .",
    "previous studies @xcite considered the far - field behaviour of solutions to dp@xmath1 , finding the asymptotic solution in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "joshi @xcite and vereshchagin @xcite also determined discrete analogues of asymptotically pole - free solutions behaviours by boutroux for the continuous first painlev equation ( p@xmath1 ) . in this paper , we find the full formal series solutions including exponentially - small terms , study the influence of stokes phenomena on these solutions , and deduce their regions of validity .",
    "the resultant asymptotic solutions share several features with the asymptotically pole - free solutions to p@xmath3 known as tronque and tritronque solutions .",
    "equation tends to p@xmath3 in the scaling limit @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , as @xmath9 .",
    "p@xmath3 is one of the six painlev equations which play a key role in a range of physical problems , in particular arising as universal models in reductions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , the korteweg - de vries equation @xcite and the boussinesq equation @xcite , and appear as models in such diverse fields such as statistical mechanics @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , electrochemistry @xcite and plasma physics @xcite .",
    "the first discrete painlev equation also arises in physical applications , such as the study of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "motivated by these applications , the study of the painlev equations in asymptotic limits has been widely pursued .",
    "however , the corresponding study of discrete painlev equations remains sparse . in this paper , we apply techniques of exponential asymptotics for differential - difference and difference equations developed by king and chapman @xcite in their analysis of the frenkel - kontorova model for atomic lattices to dp@xmath3 , in order to obtain asymptotic approximations which are accurate up to exponentially - small correction terms .",
    "we note that there have been some previous investigations into exponential asymptotics for difference equations , such as that of @xcite .",
    "the study by olde daalhuis @xcite performed a borel - plane analysis to consider the behaviour of second - order linear difference equations and to determine exponentially - improved solutions in terms of an inverse factorial series .",
    "in fact , these borel - plane methods could be applied to the current investigation , and controlled error estimates for the asymptotics could be obtained in this fashion .",
    "the primary reason for using the stokes - smoothing technique described in @xcite is that the analysis may be performed directly on the nonlinear difference equation , rather than requiring the solution to be formulated in terms of an integral expression ; this feature permits the analysis to be easily extended to a wide range of more complicated problems .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the painlev equations was studied by boutroux @xcite , who considered the behaviour of the first painlev equation ( p@xmath1 ) , @xmath10 in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "boutroux identified special solutions which are asymptotically free of poles in particular sectors of the complex plane of angular width @xmath12 , and furthermore discovered five unique solutions that are pole - free in sectors of angular width @xmath13 .",
    "these solutions are known as _",
    "tronque _ and _ tritronque _ solutions respectively , and tend to @xmath14 as @xmath11 within the asymptotically pole - free sectors . in @xcite , the real tritronque solution was shown to have no poles on the whole semi - axis @xmath15 .",
    "several asymptotic studies of p@xmath1 have been carried out in @xcite .",
    "these asymptotic approximations have played essential roles in many of the physical problems described earlier @xcite .      in this study , we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the first discrete painlev equation .",
    "the discrete painlev equations are a set of integrable nonlinear difference equations , which tend to the ordinary painlev equations when the continuum limit is taken .",
    "the discrete painlev equations first appeared in the study of solutions to the continuous painlev equations .",
    "it was discovered that these equations possess bcklund transformations , which map one solution to another solution with different parameter values , or even to a solution of a different painlev equation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these transformations have been used to construct hierarchies of solutions to the painlev equations , often in terms of rational or special functions .",
    "it was noted by fokas , its and kitaev @xcite that dp@xmath3 arises in the study of bcklund transformations associated with the fourth painlev equation ( p@xmath16 ) .",
    "this equation has two parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and is given by @xmath19 if we associate a choice of parameters @xmath20 of p@xmath16 with a solution denoted by @xmath21 , a hierarchy of solutions may be found corresponding to parameter choices @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary complex - valued constant .",
    "the recurrence relation for @xmath24 is subsequently given by @xmath25 which is simply a version of dp@xmath3 with appropriately chosen parameters .",
    "a variant of this relationship was used by @xcite to describe hierarchies of solutions to p@xmath16 in terms of parabolic cylinder functions , as well as in @xcite to construct solutions in terms of rational functions , as well as okamoto and hermite polynomials . by studying the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete painlev equations , we are able to better understand the behaviour of these solution families .",
    "the first discrete painlev equation has also featured in the study of problems arising outside of the field of integrable systems , particularly relating to the study of orthogonal and orthonormal polynomials @xcite .",
    "a set of orthonormal polynomials @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , is defined with respect to some weight function @xmath28 as satisfying @xmath29 where @xmath30 if @xmath31 and is equal to zero otherwise . in general , these polynomials satisfy a recurrence relation @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 themselves satisfy particular recurrence relations , described for example in @xcite . in the case of orthonormal polynomials with respect to the freud weight , @xmath35 , we find that @xmath36 ( this holds for all even weight functions ) , and that @xmath37 satisfies @xmath38 which , again , is dp@xmath3 , with appropriately chosen parameters . by analyzing the solutions to dp@xmath3 , we can determine the behaviour of families of orthogonal polynomials , even in the limit that their degree becomes large .",
    "it is this relationship to orthonormal polynomials that underpins the appearance of dp@xmath3 in the study of quantum gravity models @xcite .",
    "we also note in passing that the variation of @xmath24 with respect to the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath23 can be computed directly from the fourth continuous painlev equation with appropriate choice of parameters @xcite , thus confirming the existence of another connection between dp@xmath3 and p@xmath16 .    in recent decades , however , discrete integrable systems such as dp@xmath3 have become an object of study in themselves . in part , this is due to these equations being convenient examples of nonlinear difference equations which , due to their integrability , are more tractable than many equations within this class .",
    "hence , they provide a useful testing ground for mathematical techniques intended for wider applicability .",
    "the primary motivation for studying these equations , however , is to better understand their solutions .",
    "these equations are important discretizations of the continuous painlev equations ; their particular significance is due to the fact that they retain the integrability property upon discretization . they arise as independent entities in applications and possess interesting solutions , whose properties permit us to understand the behaviour of classes of functions , such as the orthonormal polynomials described above . while addressing such questions about all solutions",
    "lies beyond the scope of the present study , it motivates our interest in understanding the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete painlev equations .",
    "the formal series we study in this paper are shown to be divergent ( see section [ dpi_geq0 ] ) and contain exponentially - small terms that are invisible to conventional asymptotic approaches .",
    "the central idea of exponential asymptotic methods is that a divergent asymptotic series , when truncated optimally , produces an error term that is exponentially small in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "the problem may then be rescaled to directly determine the behaviour of this remainder term , allowing the exponentially - small component of the solution to be determined separately to the asymptotic series itself .",
    "this idea was introduced by berry @xcite , and berry and howls @xcite , who used these methods to determine the behaviour of special functions such as the airy function .",
    "as we uncover this exponentially - small behaviour , we will discover two varieties of important curves , identified originally by stokes @xcite and known as _ stokes lines _ and _ anti - stokes lines_. these curves relate to the behaviour of exponentially - small components of the solutions . as stokes lines are crossed , the exponentially - small behaviour experiences a smooth , rapid change in value in the neighbourhood of the curve itself ; in many cases , the behaviour may switch off entirely on one side of the stokes line .",
    "hence , stokes lines allow us to determine which exponentially - small contributions may be present in certain regions of the plane .",
    "anti - stokes lines determine directions where exponentially - small behaviour changes to become exponentially large , and therefore mark the boundaries of the region in which the asymptotic series expression for the solution is valid .    in this investigation",
    ", we will apply an exponential asymptotic method developed by olde daalhuis _",
    "@xcite for linear differential equations , and extended by chapman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for application to nonlinear differential equations .",
    "we provide a brief outline of the process here , however more detailed explanation of the methodology may be found in these studies .    to optimally truncate an asymptotic series",
    ", we require a general form for the asymptotic series coefficients , which is often algebraically intractable . in singular perturbation problems , dingle @xcite noted that successive terms in the asymptotic series expansion are obtained by repeated differentiation of an earlier term in the series .",
    "hence , the late - order terms @xmath40 of the resultant asymptotic series typically diverge as the ratio between a factorial and the increasing power of a function @xmath41 , such as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the gamma function defined in @xcite , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath41 are functions that do not depend on @xmath46 . in particular , the _ singulant _ @xmath41 is equal to zero when the leading - order behaviour is singular , ensuring that this singularity is present in all higher - order terms .",
    "chapman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite therefore propose a factorial - over - power ansatz ( [ ch1:ansatz ] ) for the late - order terms , which may then be used to optimally truncate the asymptotic expansion .",
    "the next step , described by olde daalhuis _",
    "@xcite , is to substitute the truncated series expression back into the original problem , obtaining an equation for the exponentially - small remainder term after truncation .",
    "the positions of stokes lines are found by determining the curves along which the remainder term varies rapidly , and the behaviour of this remainder is found by solving the remainder equation in the neighbourhood of these stokes lines .",
    "away from the stokes line , the governing behavior is obtained by solving the homogenous version of the remainder equations , generally giving an expression of the form @xmath47 ( this is a consequence of the analysis in chapman _",
    "@xcite , although it is also shown as a part of the stokes smoothing analysis contained herein ) .",
    "stokes switching will occur when the switching exponential is maximally subdominant ; this occurs when the singulant is purely real and positive .",
    "anti - stokes lines may be found when the exponential term switches from being small to large ; this occurs when the singulant is purely imaginary .",
    "these are therefore convenient conditions to determine the possible location of stokes and anti - stokes lines , as observed by dingle @xcite , and we apply them to the series solutions of dp@xmath3 .      in section 2 , we find the full formal series expansions of the ( pole - free ) solutions of dp@xmath1 and provide recurrence relations for the coefficients .",
    "it is important to note that we find two types of series solutions , called type a and b solutions .",
    "we also describe the late - order terms in these series .",
    "we determine the stokes structures of the type a solutions in section 3 , which involves descriptions of the exponentially small terms in the solutions .",
    "these are used to find the regions in which the solutions are pole - free .",
    "we carry out the analysis of type b solutions in section 4 .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and conclusions of the paper in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we expand the solution as a power series in the limit @xmath0 , and determine a recurrence relation for the coefficients of the series . finally , we determine a general expression for the late - order terms of the series .",
    "consider the first discrete painlev equation : @xmath48 now , simply scaling into the far field requires the behaviour to be smooth in this limit , however we also wish to consider asymptotically pole - free solutions that allow for the odd and even terms to vary rapidly .",
    "hence , we consider separately the odd and even terms in the series , such that @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not necessarily have the same asymptotic behaviour as @xmath0 .",
    "equation ( [ 1:pl1a ] ) may now be represented as a system , giving    @xmath52    in subsequent analysis , we assume @xmath53 with iteration @xmath54 acting on domains , and takes an initial value as given by a function @xmath55 in a domain that includes the initial point .",
    "this is a standard interpretation @xcite , and underlies the theory of difference calculus .",
    "this allows us to analytically continue the solution in the complex @xmath56-plane .",
    "we now apply the method of multiple scales in terms of the fast variable @xmath56 , and a slow variable @xmath57 .",
    "we scale @xmath50 and @xmath51 and express them such that @xmath58 which gives the rescaled equations    @xmath59    we assume that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are analytic in the variable @xmath62 , and expand the solutions to ( [ 1:pl1scaleda])-([1:pl1scaledb ] ) as a taylor series in @xmath62 to give the system    @xmath63u(s,{\\epsilon } ) & = \\alpha s + { \\epsilon}\\beta + { \\epsilon}^{1/2 } \\gamma u(s,{\\epsilon}),\\\\ \\left[v(s,{\\epsilon } ) + \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty } \\frac{2{\\epsilon}^{2j } u^{(2j)}(s,{\\epsilon})}{(2j ) ! } \\right]v(s,{\\epsilon } ) & = \\alpha s + { \\epsilon}\\beta + { \\epsilon}^{1/2}\\gamma v(s,{\\epsilon } ) .",

    "the first of these is given by @xmath70 while the second is @xmath71 where the upper and lower choice of signs correspond . in subsequent analysis",
    ", we will refer to solutions with the leading - order behaviour given by ( [ 1:earlyordersa ] ) as type a , while those with leading - order behaviour given by ( [ 1:earlyordersb ] ) as type b.    we see that in both solution types , @xmath72 and @xmath73 contain a singularity at @xmath74 , and that this singularity increases in strength by one half in each subsequent term of the asymptotic series .",
    "consequently , we expect that the series will diverge , and exponentially - small stokes switching behaviour will be present in the solution .",
    "in general , we find    @xmath75    in order to determine the optimal truncation point , we must determine the form of the terms in the asymptotic series as @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore follow @xcite , and define a late - order ansatz in the limit @xmath0 : @xmath76 where @xmath41 is the singulant , satisfying @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the prefactors , and @xmath80 is a constant .    applying this ansatz to ( [ 1:orderna])-([1:ordernb ] ) and matching leading orders of @xmath46",
    "as @xmath81 gives    @xmath82    continuing to the subsequent order as @xmath81 , we find @xmath83 and @xmath84 for type a and b solutions respectively , which are always satisfied . at the next order",
    ", we find    @xmath85    to determine the behaviour of the prefactor and singulant terms , we must consider type a and b solutions separately , and solve ( [ 1:lot1a])-([1:lot1b ] ) to find the singulant @xmath86 , and then ( [ 1:lota2])-([1:lotb2 ] ) to find the prefactors @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "in this section , we solve the late - order term equations for type a solutions .",
    "we use the resultant expressions to determine the stokes structure , as well as the form of the exponentially - small components of the solution . from these results ,",
    "we determine the region of the complex plane which is asymptotically pole - free .",
    "the singulant equations given in ( [ 1:lot1a])-([1:lot1b ] ) reduce to @xmath89 recalling that we are considering the late - order terms in the limit @xmath81 , the leading - order behaviour of @xmath41 may be found by taking the series to be infinite , introducing error into the singulant behaviour that is only exponentially - small in this limit .",
    "this gives @xmath90 the solutions to this expression take the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is any integer . in general , the late - order behaviour of @xmath93 and @xmath94 will be the sum of terms associated with the singulants given in ( [ 2:singulant0 ] ) , with each term associated with a particular choice of sign and @xmath92 .",
    "however , in a similar fashion to the analysis carried out in @xcite , we note that this sum will be dominated in the @xmath0 limit by the two terms associated with @xmath95 .",
    "hence , we may restrict our attention to these components in our analysis .",
    "recalling that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are singular at @xmath74 , and hence that @xmath77 , we find that the relevant singulants are given by @xmath96    to find the prefactor associated with these singulants , we solve ( [ 1:lota2])-([1:lotb2 ] ) .",
    "we take the limit of the summation terms as @xmath0 .",
    "equation ( [ 1:lotb2 ] ) becomes @xmath97 applying the form of the singulant given in ( [ 2:singulant0 ] ) , we find that this reduces to @xmath98 .",
    "hence we set the prefactor @xmath99 , where @xmath100 takes constant value .",
    "recalling that there are two distinct singulant contributions , we conclude that there are two constants associated with @xmath78 , denoted as @xmath101 and @xmath102 . a similar analysis performed on ( [ 1:lota2 ] ) produces @xmath103 .",
    "hence , we find that there are also two constants associated with @xmath79 , which we will denote as @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "finally , we note that for the ansatz ( [ 1:ansatz ] ) to be consistent with the leading - order behaviour given in ( [ 1:earlyordersa ] ) , we must have @xmath106 .",
    "this gives a singularity of the appropriate strength in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "hence , the late - order terms are given by    @xmath108    the only component of the late - order terms that remains to be found is the value of the constants @xmath109 , which may be determined numerically .",
    "we illustrate this on an example problem in appendix [ a_typea ] .      having calculated @xmath110 and @xmath111 ,",
    "we recall from section [ method ] that the behaviour of the exponential term will be proportional to @xmath112 ; this is also demonstrated in the full stokes switching analysis contained within appendix [ a2 ] .",
    "this term will be exponentially small when @xmath113 , and exponentially large when @xmath114 .",
    "we also recall that stokes lines exist where @xmath115 and @xmath113 , while anti - stokes lines follow @xmath116 .",
    "figure [ stokes_dpia1 ] illustrates the behaviour of the singulants in each of the four quadrants within the complex @xmath62-plane .",

    "as the stokes lines are crossed , we note that the remainder term is of algebraic order along anti - stokes lines",
    ". however , this would make it comparable in size to the leading - order behaviour on the positive real axis , which is not possible .",
    "hence , we conclude that the remainder terms associated with @xmath110 and @xmath111 are not present along the real axis at all , and hence can not be active in the first or fourth quadrant .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the exponential contributions associated with @xmath110 and @xmath111 are present on the left - hand side of their stokes lines , but are switched off as they cross from the left to the right - hand side ( into the fourth and first quadrant respectively ) .",
    "figure [ stokes_dpia2 ] illustrates the regions in which the exponential contributions are active .",
    "importantly , we see that as the exponential contributions associated with @xmath110 and @xmath111 are present only in the third and second quadrants respectively , in which they are exponentially small ( as @xmath113 ) , they do not cause any difficulty for the validity of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "hence , the solutions satisfying ( [ 1:earlyordersa ] ) are valid on the entire complex plane , with the exception of the branch cut .",
    "we therefore conclude that the solutions are asymptotically pole - free in the entire far - field , aside from the negative real axis .    finally , now that we know the nature of the switching behaviour as the stokes lines are crossed , we are in a position to calculate the precise form of the remainder term associated with the late - order terms , and hence determine the exponentially - small contribution present in the problem .",
    "to determine the behaviour in the neighbourhood of the stokes line , we return to ( [ 1:pl1expandeda])-([1:pl1expandedb ] ) .",
    "now , we express @xmath117 and @xmath118 as asymptotic expansions truncated after @xmath119 terms , with remainder @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively , such that @xmath122 if @xmath119 is chosen so that the series are truncated after their smallest terms , the remainder terms will be exponentially small . by considering the behaviour of these remainder terms ,",
    "we can obtain the exponentially - small corrections to the asymptotic series , and use these to determine the region in which the asymptotic series provides a valid approximation of the exact solution .",
    "a full analysis of the remainder terms @xmath120 and @xmath121 is given in appendix [ a2 ] .",
    "this analysis is quite technical ; we therefore summarize the results in the remainder of this section .    from appendix",
    "[ a2 ] , we find that the optimal truncation point is given by @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is chosen so that @xmath119 is integer - valued .",
    "the remainder terms given in ( [ 4:rnout])-([4:rnout2 ] ) are shown to take the form @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the stokes - switching parameter that varies rapidly in the neighbourhood of stokes lines . from the analysis in appendix [ a2 ] , we find that the value of @xmath127 changes smoothly from @xmath128 to @xmath129 when crossing from the third to the fourth quadrant , and the value of @xmath130 changes smoothly from @xmath131 to @xmath132 when crossing from the second to the first quadrant . hence , the exponential behaviour of the asymptotic approximation has been completely determined , and is shown in figure [ stokes_dpia2](b ) .    consequently , the optimally - truncated asymptotic series for @xmath60 and @xmath61 takes the form @xmath133 where the leading orders of @xmath93 and @xmath94 are give in ( [ 1:earlyordersa ] ) , and the late - order behaviour is given in ( [ 2:lot ] ) .",
    "this expression is therefore an accurate asymptotic approximation up to exponentially - small terms , valid in the entire complex @xmath62-plane .",
    "in this section , we determine the late - order asymptotic terms associated with type b. these are then used to determine the exponentially - small contributions to the asymptotic solution , and subsequently the stokes structure . from these results ,",
    "we determine the region of validity for the general solution , and show that for particular choices of the two stokes - switching parameters , the region of validity may be extended .      when considering type b solutions , we find that the asymptotic series expansion for @xmath117 and @xmath118 are identical , and hence that @xmath134 for all values of @xmath46 .",
    "we therefore set @xmath135 .",
    "now , using ( [ 1:earlyordersb ] ) , both singulant equations ( [ 1:lot1a])-([1:lot1b ] ) reduce to @xmath136 where we have again taken the upper bound of the summation terms to be infinite . from the leading - order behaviour ( [ 1:earlyordersb ] ) , we know that the solution is singular at @xmath74 , and hence that @xmath137 at @xmath138 . solving ( [ 1:eikonal ] ) with this boundary condition gives @xmath139s.\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is some integer . as in type a solutions , the late - order behaviour for @xmath93 will take the form of an infinite sum of factorial - over - power ansatz terms , each associated with a unique choice of @xmath41 . however , at late orders , this sum will be dominated by the four terms associated with @xmath140 and @xmath141 , which have the smallest absolute value . hence , the four terms that contribute to the exponential behaviour of the solution are @xmath142 we observe that , unlike type a , there are four sets of late - order behaviour to be considered in order to understand the stokes structure of the associated solution . by solving ( [ 1:lota2])-([1:lotb2 ] ) , we again find that @xmath98 .",
    "however , in this case , there are four distinct singulant expressions , and hence four constants associated with the corresponding late - order terms ( denoted @xmath101 - @xmath105 ) .",
    "we also find that , as before , @xmath106 .",
    "hence , we find that the late - order terms may be expressed as @xmath143 where @xmath144 is associated with @xmath145 .    the numerical process to determine @xmath144 is more complicated than that demonstrated in appendix [ 1:2inner ] , as we must now compute four values of @xmath144 , rather than two . an example numerical calculation is illustrated in appendix [ a_typeb ] .",
    "having calculated the singulants , we may determine the stokes structure in a similar fashion to section [ 0:stokesstruct ] , noting that stokes lines follow curves on which @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and anti - stokes lines follow curves satisfying @xmath116 .",
    "the behaviour of the four different singulants is illustrated in figure [ stokes_dpiab ] .    from this figure",
    ", we see that the stokes structure of the solution is substantially more complicated than in type a solutions .",
    "not only are there four different exponential contributions to consider , but there are two different sets of stokes lines , each associated with two of the singulants",
    ".    there is , however , also a more interesting difference . from figure [ stokes_dpia1 ] , we were able to conclude that neither exponential contribution could be present on the positive real axis in type a solutions , as they would not be exponentially small . hence , as the jump across stokes lines is prescribed in ( [ 4:remainderr])-([4:remainders ] ) , the asymptotic behaviour is specified uniquely , with no free parameters . however , from figure [ stokes_dpiab ] , we see that this is no longer true for type b solutions . while we can see that @xmath111 and @xmath146 can not be present on the positive real axis , as they would be exponentially large in the asymptotic limit , the same can not be said about @xmath110 and @xmath147 . as @xmath148 on the positive real axis ,",
    "the associated exponential contribution is exponentially small , and the asymptotic series is still valid when such contributions are present .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath149 on the real axis may be freely specified , meaning that the solution contains two free parameters .",
    "consequently , we determine that the exponential contributions active in each region of the plane are those shown in figure [ stokes_dpiab2](a ) .",
    "we see that , assuming that @xmath149 is nonzero on the real axis , the region in which the asymptotic expansion associated with ( [ 1:earlyordersb ] ) is valid is a sector between the anti - stokes lines associated with @xmath150 and @xmath151 , in which the exponentials associated with @xmath111 and @xmath146 are inactive , and those associated with @xmath110 and @xmath147 are exponentially small .",
    "the angle between the edge of the sector and the real axis ( denoted by @xmath152 in figure [ stokes_dpiab2 ] ) is given by @xmath153    however , we note that it is possible to choose @xmath154 on the real axis .",
    "figure [ stokes_dpiab2](b ) illustrates this behaviour . in this case , the region in which the asymptotic expansion is valid is substantially larger than the general case shown in figure [ stokes_dpiab2](a ) ; there is no exponential contribution associated with @xmath110 or @xmath147 to become large as the anti - stokes lines are crossed . instead , the angle @xmath152 is now given by @xmath155      using a nearly identical analysis to section [ 2.4:smoothing ] , we are able to show that for type b solutions , the quantity switched across each stokes line takes the form @xmath156 where @xmath120 is again the exponential contribution to the solution , and @xmath157 is the stokes switching parameter .",
    "using matched asymptotic expansions , we find that @xmath158^+_- \\sim \\frac{6\\pi}{\\chi'\\sinh(-\\chi')}.\\ ] ] we note that @xmath159 hence , from ( [ 1:rng0 ] ) , the full exponential behaviour takes the form @xmath160 where @xmath161 switches rapidly across the relevant stokes line such that the difference is given by @xmath162^+_- \\sim \\frac{2\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{\\log(-2-\\sqrt{3})},\\qquad [ \\mathcal{s } _ { 3,4}]^+_- \\sim \\frac{-2\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{\\log(-2+\\sqrt{3})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also note for completion that @xmath163 and @xmath164 must equal zero on one side of the stokes line , and hence are uniquely determined , while this condition is not required for @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "however , if both @xmath167 and @xmath168 are zero , we obtain the special stokes structure illustrated in figure [ stokes_dpiab2](b ) .    consequently , the optimally - truncated asymptotic series for @xmath60 , and hence @xmath61 , is shown to take the form @xmath169 where the leading orders of @xmath93 are give in ( [ 1:earlyordersb ] ) , and the late - order behaviour is given in ( [ 4:lotcalc ] ) .",
    "this expression is an accurate asymptotic approximation up to exponentially - small terms . unlike the type a solution , however , this approximation of the type b solution is only valid within a wedge of the complex plane illustrated in figure [ stokes_dpiab2 ] .",
    "we also recall from section [ 1.3:structure ] that @xmath130 and @xmath170 are uniquely determined , while @xmath127 and @xmath171 contain a stokes - switching parameter that may be freely specified ; this behaviour is not present in the asymptotic approximation of type a solutions .",
    "in this paper , we used methods of exponential asymptotics to compute and investigate two types of asymptotic solutions to the first discrete painlev equation , associated with the leading order behaviours described in ( [ 1:earlyordersa ] ) and ( [ 1:earlyordersb ] ) .",
    "we identified the stokes structure of the solution for each type , and used this information to deduce the sectors displaying asymptotically pole - free behaviour in the far - field limit .",
    "these asymptotic solutions were given as the sum of a truncated asymptotic power series and an exponentially - subdominant remainder term , shown in ( [ 4:asymp1app])-([4:asymp1app2 ] ) for type a solutions , and ( [ 4:asymp2app ] ) for type b solutions .    in section [ casea ] , we showed that the asymptotic solution associated with ( [ 1:earlyordersa ] ) is a valid approximation in the far field of the entire complex plane , aside from a branch - cut along the negative real axis , and hence the solution is asymptotically pole - free .",
    "this solution has no exponentially - small behaviour on the positive real axis , although there is exponentially - small behaviour present in the left - half complex plane .",
    "this implies that this asymptotic behaviour is uniquely defined , with no free parameter present in the solution .",
    "the asymptotic solution associated with ( [ 1:earlyordersb ] ) , discussed in section [ caseb ] , is generally asymptotically pole - free within a narrow wedge in the complex plane containing the positive real axis , seen in figure [ stokes_dpiab2](a ) . unlike the first asymptotic solution , however , there are two free parameters in the asymptotic approximation , associated with stokes switching .",
    "if these parameters are chosen appropriately , we discover asymptotic solutions with larger ranges of validity , such as that shown in figure [ stokes_dpiab2](b ) . outside of the asymptotically pole - free regions ,",
    "the asymptotic series solution is no longer valid , and we instead see the elliptic function behaviour described by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the oscillatory behaviour that is present along anti - stokes lines is a degenerate form of this behaviour .",
    "we note with interest that the two classes of asymptotically pole - free solutions to dp@xmath3 , types a and b , demonstrate power series - type behaviour in the far field , however they differ in that type a solutions are uniquely specified with no free parameters , while type b solutions contain free parameters associated with the stokes multipliers in the solution .",
    "similar asymptotic behaviour is seen in the tritronque and tronque solutions to p@xmath3 , the former of which is uniquely specified , while the latter contains free parameters associated with stokes switching .",
    "consequently , the two classes of asymptotic behaviour described in this study may be regarded as corresponding to tritronque and tronque solutions of p@xmath3 respectively .",
    "the asymptotic solutions to dp@xmath3 also provide insight into the behaviour of solution hierarchies to the equations described in ( [ 0:p4dp1 ] ) and ( [ 0:pndpi ] ) .",
    "the first of these describes solution hierarchies to the fourth painlev equation .",
    "for example , type b solutions ( [ 1:earlyordersb ] ) correspond to solution families which grow as @xmath172 in the large-@xmath56 limit , with the parameters described in ( [ 0:p4par ] ) also growing appropriately .",
    "these solution hierarchies are of particular mathematical interest due to their power series dependence on @xmath56 in the asymptotic limit , which is particular to the asymptotic classes of dp@xmath3 solutions described in the present study .",
    "finally , we emphasize that this methodology may be applied to a wide range of difference equations , as it does not require the problem to be integrable , nor does it require that solution be expressed in terms of an integral equation .",
    "this is demonstrated in appendix [ a3 ] , where we outline how this procedure could be applied to determine the stokes switching behaviour of a non - integrable difference equation .",
    "consequently , although we applied the method to determine information about the exponentially - small components of the solution to dp@xmath3 , it could easily be adapted to analyze asymptotic solutions of broad classes of difference equations .",
    "one particular case of interest is the behaviour of orthonormal polynomials satisfying ( [ 0:pnw ] ) for a variety of different weight functions , such as the semi - classical weights described in @xcite . in general ,",
    "these polynomial families may be computed using non - integrable difference equations . however , as there is no aspect of the methodology which depends on the integrability of the equation , these difference equations are still amenable to the asymptotic methods described in the present study .",

    "this limit may be computed for different values of @xmath189 and @xmath190 , although convergence can be somewhat slow for some choices of parameters .",
    "finally , if we permit @xmath45 to take nonzero values , we must consider the late - term behaviour of @xmath174 and @xmath191 independently , and solve for the four values of @xmath144 separately .      when considering the more complicated form of the late - order terms for type b solutions given in ( [ 4:lotcalc ] ) , we must solve for four different values of @xmath144 . in this case , we write @xmath192 , and note the late - order terms may be rewritten as @xmath193 while this expression is not as simple as ( [ a : lot1 ] ) , we may still use it to determine the values of @xmath144 by taking four distinct values of @xmath46 and solving the resultant system of equations . as these values of @xmath46",
    "become large , the computed values for @xmath144 will converge to the appropriate values .",
    "we consider a numerical example , choosing @xmath194 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( ensuring that @xmath134 , and hence eliminating the need to consider @xmath191 separately ) .",
    "we begin with the leading - order solution @xmath181 and compute the behaviour of @xmath174 up to @xmath195 and use four consecutive even values of @xmath46 in ( [ a : lambda ] ) to generate the system of equations which is subsequently solved for @xmath144 .",
    "the computed values of @xmath101 and @xmath105 are shown in figure [ afig2 ] for a range of values of @xmath46 , and we see that they are converging to a constant value . by taking a system of equations using sufficiently large computed values of @xmath174 , we find that @xmath196 we have therefore determined the form of the late - order terms @xmath174 , and consequently @xmath191 . again , if we considered an example with @xmath197 , we would find that @xmath198 , and the values of @xmath144 associated with @xmath191 would need to be computed separately .",
    "to perform an exponential asymptotic analysis on the remainder terms in ( [ 4:seriesn ] ) , we must ensure that the asymptotic series is truncated optimally . to find the optimal truncation point , we follow the commonly - used strategy described by @xcite , in which the series is truncated at its smallest term ( and hence where consecutive terms have the same size ) .    by solving @xmath199 in the limit @xmath68 and @xmath200 ,",
    "we find that @xmath201 .",
    "hence , we will set @xmath202 where @xmath203 is chosen so that @xmath119 takes integer value ; the choice of the two in @xmath204 is one of algebraic convenience .    applying this series expression and using ( [ 1:orderna])-([1:ordernb ] ) to eliminate terms , recalling that @xmath205 ,",
    "gives    @xmath206    where the omitted terms will be smaller in the limit @xmath68 than those which have been retained .",

    "we apply a wkb ansatz to the homogenous version of ( [ 4:pl1b ] ) by setting @xmath207 .",
    "the solution away from the stokes line ( where the right - hand side not have any effect ) is therefore given by the homogenous version of ( [ 4:pl1b ] ) , and therefore to leading order as @xmath68 @xmath208 by comparing this to the singulant equation ( [ lot : sing ] ) , we see that we can write @xmath209 , where @xmath41 represents the value of the singulant under consideration ; here , the analysis will be performed in the general case , with the particular choice of @xmath41 made afterwards . continuing to the next order in @xmath67 , we will find that @xmath210 is given by a constant .",
    "hence , away from the stokes line , the exponentially - small remainder takes the form @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is a constant , which we will set to be the associated value for @xmath100 .",
    "knowing that the behaviour will switch rapidly in the neighbourhood of the stokes line , we set @xmath213 where @xmath157 is the stokes switching parameter that varies rapidly as the stokes line is crossed .",
    "the multiplier @xmath100 is chosen for subsequent algebraic convenience . applying this ansatz to ( [ 4:pl1a ] ) gives , after some cancellation ,",
    "@xmath214 as @xmath200 , the series may be taken to be infinite , introducing only exponential error .",
    "however , we have already discarded terms containing algebraic error , so this is not a concern .",
    "we therefore write @xmath215 noting the form of @xmath216 given in ( [ 1:ansatz ] ) , we write @xmath217    noting the form of the optimal truncation ( [ 4:nopt ] ) , we set @xmath218 and restrict ourselves to curves with @xmath219 fixed .",

    "we also recall that @xmath106 .",
    "hence , applying stirling s formula and simplifying eventually gives @xmath224 this is exponentially small , except in the neighbourhood of @xmath225 , which corresponds to the stokes line ( that is , @xmath41 being purely real and positive ) . to determine the local behaviour",

    "recalling that there are exponential contributions from the two singulants given in ( [ 2:singulant ] ) , we find a combined expression @xmath234 where @xmath127 changes rapidly from four to zero when crossing from the third to the fourth quadrant in the smooth manner described by ( [ 4:ajump ] ) , and @xmath130 changes from negative four to zero when crossing from the second to the first quadrant in the same way .",
    "a similar analysis shows that @xmath235",
    "to demonstrate the utility of this method , we consider a non - integrable variant of dp@xmath1 , and briefly outline the steps required to determine the late - order term behaviour , and hence the stokes structure of the solution .",
    "we begin with the equation presented in ( [ 0:dpi ] ) , and adjust the final term , giving @xmath236 representing this as a system of equations in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , defined as in ( [ 2:yz ] ) .",
    "we again using the method of multiple scales by considering the slow variation in terms of @xmath237 , and apply the transformation given in ( [ 1:scaling ] ) .",
    "hence the rescaled equations become ( after taylor expansion in @xmath62 )    @xmath238u(s,{\\epsilon } ) & = \\alpha s + { \\epsilon}\\beta + \\gamma u(s,{\\epsilon})^2,\\\\ \\left[v(s,{\\epsilon } ) + \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty } \\frac{2{\\epsilon}^{2j } u^{(2j)}(s,{\\epsilon})}{(2j ) ! } \\right]v(s,{\\epsilon } ) & = \\alpha s + { \\epsilon}\\beta + \\gamma v(s,{\\epsilon})^2 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we expand the solutions @xmath60 and @xmath61 as a formal series in powers of @xmath67 , rather than half - integer powers as in section [ dpi_geq0 ] , as there is no @xmath64 present in the rescaled equations .",
    "we denote the coefficients multiplying @xmath239 as @xmath174 and @xmath191 . as in the analysis of dp@xmath3 , there are two sets of solutions , associated with the leading - order behaviours @xmath240 which we again refer to as type a and type b solutions respectively .",
    "we find that the general relation for higher - order terms becomes        applying this ansatz to ( [ a : orderna])-([a : ordernb ] ) and matching leading orders of @xmath46 as @xmath81 gives new singulant and prefactor equations .",

    ", we may obtain new prefactor equations , and perform a stokes switching analysis in a similar fashion to the analysis performed on dp@xmath3 .",
    "we therefore see that , although the exponential asymptotic method described in this study may be used to study the stokes - switching behaviour of integrable equations such as the discrete painlev equations , it does not depend on the integrability of the problem , and hence may be applied to a much more broad class of equations without significant changes to the process .    9 duits m , kuijlaars abj .",
