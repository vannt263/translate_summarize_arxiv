    "is a faint blue star that was identified as the counterpart of a bright soft x - ray source @xcite .",
    "spectroscopically , it is a member of the pg1159 class but , within this class  is an extraordinary object .",
    "it was shown that it is not only hydrogen - deficient but also helium - deficient . from optical spectra",
    "it was concluded that the atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon and oxygen , by equal amounts @xcite .",
    "strong neon lines were detected in soft x - ray spectra taken with the _ euve _ satellite and in a keck spectrum , and a high abundance of neon was derived @xcite .",
    "the origin of this exotic surface chemistry ( c = 49% , o = 49% , ne = 2% , mass fractions ) is completely unclear .",
    "we have speculated that  represents the naked c  o core of a white dwarf .",
    "another , even more exciting possibility is that we see the eroded c  o envelope of a o  ne  mg white dwarf .",
    "this is corroborated by our analysis of a _",
    "chandra _ soft x - ray spectrum @xcite , which allowed the detection of magnesium",
    ".    turns out to be the hottest single wd ever analyzed with model atmospheres (  = 200000k @xmath0 20000k ,  = 8.0 @xmath0 0.5 ) , only rivaled by the hot do  ( see wassermann etal .  in these proceedings , and @xcite ) .",
    "because of this extremely high temperature , a unique photospheric absorption - line spectrum can be observed with _",
    "chandra - letg_. it shows a wealth of lines from highly ionized species ( ,  ,  ) .",
    "but the spectral analysis of the x - ray data is seriously hampered by heavy line blanketing of iron - group elements . in principle , we can account for this in our synthetic spectra , but two problems prevent a detailed quantitative analysis of relatively weak absorption lines from light metals within the fe - group forest .",
    "first , accurate line positions are unknown for the majority of the fe - group lines .",
    "second , the bulk of the fe - group lines from very high ionization stages ( a single uv line was recently discovered in a _ fuse _ spectrum , see werner , rauch , & kruk , these proceedings ; and @xcite ) are completely unknown . consequently , effects of fe - group line blending on other weak metal lines can not be calculated with sufficient precision .",
    "nevertheless , we have roughly estimated the mg abundance to about 1% , an amount similar to the ne abundance .",
    "if this strong overabundance ( 20 times solar ) can be confirmed , then that would strongly support the idea that  is a o  ne  mg wd .",
    "this means that  might had been one of the `` heavy - weight '' intermediate - mass stars ( 8m@xmath1 @xmath2  10m@xmath3 ) that form white dwarfs with electron - degenerate o ",
    " mg cores .",
    "evolutionary models @xcite predict strong ne and mg overabundances in the c / o envelope .",
    "another strong argument in favor of this idea would be the detection of sodium , which would be direct evidence for c - burning .",
    "the models predict that the @xmath4na abundance at the bottom of the c / o envelope is comparable to that of neon ( main isotope @xmath5ne ) and magnesium ( @xmath6 mg , see fig .",
    "34 in @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to detect na lines in the _ chandra _ spectrum beyond doubt because of , again , heavy metal - line blanketing .",
    "at present it is uncertain under which circumstances super - agb stars ( i.e. the massive counterparts of agb stars that ignite carbon but do not proceed to further stages of nuclear burning ) produce o  ne  mg wds or explode as electron - capture sne producing nss ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this uncertainty mainly arises from modeling uncertainties in mass - loss and mixing processes .",
    "the possibility that  is a o  ne  mg wd is remarkable , because evidence for the existence of such objects is rather scarce @xcite .",
    "evidence from single massive wds is weak , and the most convincing cases are wds in binary systems .",
    "strong ne overabundances are found in novae @xcite or in eroded wd cores in lmxbs @xcite . if we can prove high mg and na abundances in , then this would be the most compelling case for the existence of a single o  ne  mg wd , i.e. a post super - agb star .",
    "it is interesting to note that the recently discovered relatively cool white dwarfs (  @xmath7 20000k , see dufour et al . ,",
    "these proceedings , and @xcite ) with almost pure carbon atmospheres ( so - called hot dqs ) , as well as the o - rich white dwarfs ( he - dominated atmospheres with o / he@xmath70.01 and o@xmath8c , by number , and  around 10000k ) reported by gnsicke etal .",
    "( these proceedings , and @xcite ) , could be evolutionary linked to .",
    "the latter , in particular , could well be o  ne  mg white dwarfs .",
    "also challenges stellar evolution theory relevant for super - agb stars , because it can not explain how  has lost its h - rich and he - rich envelopes and why it exposes its metal - rich core .",
    "our detailed abundance determination of the h - deficient pg1159 stars has shown that the efficiency of convective overshoot during he - shell flashes is stronger than hitherto assumed in evolutionary calculations . in analogy , the determination of the strange surface chemistry of  challenges super - agb evolutionary models , which are unable to explain the observed helium - deficiency .        .",
    "our immediate motivation to perform new observations is the search for mg and na lines in the uv spectrum of  and to determine the respective abundances .",
    "the uv range is certainly free of iron - group lines .",
    "hot central stars of planetary nebulae (  @xmath7 100kk ) show iron lines of  in the uv .",
    "but  is so hot that the dominant ionization stages of the fe - group elements are ix and x. almost all respective lines are located in the euv and soft - x - ray regions .",
    "hence , we should be able to detect and analyze even very weak lines of light metals in the uv .",
    "we expect to see mg and na lines if these elements are abundant on the 1% level .",
    "there are three multiplets of and two multiplets of located in the 11501700    region .",
    "the _ cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) _ was installed at _ hst _ in may 2009 . on oct .  24 , 2009 , _",
    "hst _ recovered from a shutdown of its science data formatting ( sic&dh ) onboard computer , an event that spoiled our observations because they were performed shortly afterwards , on the same day .",
    "_ cos _ spectroscopy of  was performed with gratings g130",
    "m and g160 m during one orbit each .",
    "the wavelength range 11501760    was covered with about 0.1    resolution .",
    "data inspection revealed problems with the flux calibration , related to the recovery of sic&dh .",
    "it turned out that the _ cos _ detectors worked outside of their normal temperature range .",
    "as a consequence , image distortions were large enough to place stim pulses  required for the distortion correction  off the detector .",
    "our request for repetition of the observations was accepted .",
    "this repetition was performed on may 25 , 2010 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] displays the four _ cos _ spectral segments compared to a spectrum computed from a model with parameters found from our earlier multi - spectral analyses mentioned above .",
    "almost all prominent line features are from , , and , hence , elements ( and ions ) that were already identified in _ fuse _ spectra @xcite .",
    "new identifications are lines from , , and .",
    "it is remarkable that , without fine - tuning , our model fits the  1371  line very well ( figs.[fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] ) , indicating that , in conjunction with the fit to lines ,  is now known to an accuracy of about 3% @xcite .    a close inspection of the data reveals about 70 unidentified photospheric lines .",
    "many of them are probably multiplets , but the problem is that their positions are rather uncertain ( within several  ) .",
    "this seriously hampers the identification of other species .",
    "in particular , the identification of will be very difficult .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the regions around the three multiplets in more detail .",
    "it is not obvious that the predicted lines have counterparts in the observation .",
    "the two strongest predicted lines are shown in even more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( top panel ) .",
    "no lines are visible at the nist wavelength positions . like for , the line positions are uncertain",
    ". it could well be , that some of the unidentified features in fig.[fig4 ] are lines .",
    "for example , shifting the computed lines by 5.5  ( lower panel ) puts them in place of two observed lines .",
    "a systematic analysis of and level energies will be necessary in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "a number of other line features are from the following potential candidates ( but often we face again problems with line position accuracy ) : , , , , , and .",
    "the reality of many features is confirmed by the presence of similar features in a high - resolution , high - s / n _ hst / stis _ e140h archival spectrum of the pg1159-type central star of ngc246 ( = 150000k , = 5.7 @xcite ) ."
