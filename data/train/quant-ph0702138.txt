    "social needs for secure communications to prevent eavesdropping , impersonation , falsification , and denial of service have increased dramatically in recent years accompanying the expansion of the service industry on the internet .",
    "communication protocols based on quantum entanglement with non - local correlation have been the focus of intensive research as a possible means of providing secure communications @xcite .",
    "such protocols often require prior sharing of entangled photons @xcite or entangled atomic systems @xcite among more than two nodes .",
    "however , there is a practical difficulty in sharing entangled photons between distal nodes , since the photons are usually transmitted over lossy communication channels @xcite . in such situations , photons entangled at the input of the channel",
    "can readily become a useless mixture of vacuum and photons at the output . to address this problem ,",
    "it is necessary to purify the final mixture by removing the vacuum component @xcite .",
    "quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements , by which the arrival of a signal photon is detected without affecting the qubit state ( encoded into the polarization mode ) , may be very suitable for this purpose @xcite . in this study , a new scheme for qnd measurement that can be applied in cases involving the mixture of vacuum and photons is proposed .",

    "the mixed state composed of vacuum and one - photon states at @xmath3 is thus purified into a one - photon state at the output port @xmath4 after filtering by filter f , which allows the signal photon to pass through the filter only when the detector d1 detects the ancillary photon . when there is no photon at @xmath3 , ancillary photons appear at the reflection port @xmath5 .",
    "it is necessary to compose the corresponding realizations for the above scheme such that the qubit state of the signal photon is unchanged .",
    "figure  [ fig : qnd](b ) shows the proposed qnd scheme for the case that the qubit state is encoded into the polarization mode of the signal photon .",
    "when the signal photon appears at @xmath3 , the photon is transmitted or reflected at the polarization beam splitter pbs1 depending on the polarization mode .",
    "the polarization of the transmitted photon is orthogonal to that of the reflected photon . after passing through pbs1",

    "for the same purpose , the input state at each ancillary input port @xmath0 in fig .  [ fig : qnd](b ) must be a superposition of vacuum and one - photon states .",
    "in particular , when the input state at each @xmath0 is a one - photon state , the wave - packet component at each ancillary reflection port @xmath5 must be detected by the same procedure as for the wave - packet component at each ancillary output port @xmath2 .",

    "the functionality of sqnd has been proposed and demonstrated based on a @xmath6 material for modulating the phase of the ancillary photon only when a signal photon passes through the material @xcite .",
    "the phase change is then detected by a single - photon self - interference measurement after separating the ancillary photon from the signal photon , which are orthogonally polarized , by pbs .",
    "however , phase modulation by a single photon is very small @xcite , and the interference related to phase modulation will be suppressed due to entanglement between the signal photon and the ancillary photon , which changes the pulse shape of the ancillary photon .",
    "the self - interference effect is thus reduced , degrading the efficiency of sqnd . to avoid the use of weak @xmath6 nonlinearities , a single - photon qnd device composed of linear optics and projective measurements has been proposed .",
    "however , such a scheme requires strict mode - matching between the signal photon and the probe photon as one of a maximally entangled photon pair @xcite .",
    "the qnd measurement scheme is implemented in the present study by a simple and efficient method involving a two - sided atom - cavity system consisting of two identical mirrors and an atom coupled with a single mode of a cavity .",
    "figure  [ fig : qnd](c ) shows a schematic of the proposed implementation for sqnd .",

    "the ancillary photons are considered to be totally reflected by the atom cavity when there is no signal photon at the input .",
    "this is realizable as suggested by the experiments of turchette and coworkers @xcite .",
    "when a signal photon arrives at the input , reflection of ancillary photons at the atom cavity is suppressed by saturation of the atomic transition due to the absorption of signal photons .",
    "detection of the ancillary photon at d2 and d3 thus implies the arrival of the signal photon .    in the scheme shown in fig .",

    "one of the promising candidates for experimental realization of the two - sided atom - cavity is a single quantum dot exciton system coupled with the cavity mode of a photonic crystal @xcite .",
    "such a system provides design capabilities for temporal stability and reproductivity of the dipole coupling with the cavity mode . for a transition frequency and oscillator strength of the exciton of @xmath178  ghz ( @xmath179  ev ) and @xmath180 ,",

    "the maximal efficiency for the qnd is @xmath188 and the success probability is @xmath189 in the symmetric case . as there is little difference between the symmetric and asymmetric cases in terms of efficiency and success probability , the corresponding values for the asymmetric case should be similar .",
    "note that the efficiency of @xmath188 is a maximum , since the temporal evolution of a single exciton dipole under interaction with phonons , driven by weak coherent light with pulse duration of @xmath187  ps or more is unknown .",

    "it will also be necessary to conduct detailed theoretical analyses of the decoherence time by phonons beyond the independent boson model @xcite in order to discuss efficiencies of greater than @xmath168 .",
    "a qnd measurement scheme involving a two - sided atom - cavity system for the detection of photon arrival in entanglement sharing was proposed .",
    "the efficiency and success probability of the scheme were estimated by analyzing the responses of the two - sided atom - cavity system for one- and two - photon input over a range of input pulse duration .",
    "the conditions for improved qnd performance were also examined .",

    "was obtained . in the case of signal photons with pulse duration of @xmath167 and ancilliary photons with pulse duration of @xmath159 ,",
    "the obtained success probability was @xmath166 .",
    "the success probability can be increased to @xmath191 by returning the signal photon to the input when no ancillary photon is detected on the right side of the cavity .",
    "decoherence on the signal wave - packet after detection of the ancillary photon is suppressed by choosing signal and ancillary photon pulse durations much larger than the radiative relaxation time of the atom - cavity , in which case the pulse shape of the signal photon is approximated by the wave function @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is a normalization factor .",
    "the proposed qnd scheme functions correctly even if the ancillary photon is replaced with weak light described by the superposition of vacuum and one - photon states .",
    "therefore , the proposal is applicable not only for entanglement sharing but also for general purification of a single photon state . realization of the proposal scheme is therefore expected to drive substantial progress in photon manipulation technology .",
    "in the temporal evolution under the total hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : exthamiltonian ] ) , the initial number of energy quanta is always preserved .",
    "for example , the number of energy quanta for a two - photon input is two , and this number is always preserved even upon interaction with the atom - cavity system .",
    "the possible states in the interaction of the v - type three - level system with two distinguishable photons photon1 and photon2 are thus @xmath194 the state @xmath195 denotes a state in which the cavity mode @xmath196 and all modes of the `` rm field '' @xmath197 are in the vacuum state , and one mode of the `` lm field '' @xmath198 is in the first excited state , with the remaining states being the vacuum state .",
    "the state @xmath199 denotes a state in which the cavity mode @xmath196 and all modes of the `` rm field '' @xmath197 and the `` lm field '' @xmath198 are in the vacuum state .",

    "the two two - level atomic systems in the double excited state ( @xmath206 ) emit two photons simultaneously .",
    "this difference implies that the quantum state of the v - type system should be expressed as a quantum state in the subspace spanned by the basis except for the double excited state @xmath206 of the two two - level atomic systems .",
    "the ground state of the v - type atomic system @xmath101 corresponds to the ground state of the two two - level atomic systems @xmath121 . from the view - point of single photon",
    "resonant transition processes , the allowed transition to and from either of the two excited states @xmath99 and @xmath100 correspond to the transition to and from either of the two excited states @xmath122 and @xmath123 . using these correspondences , the operator @xmath207 in eq .",
