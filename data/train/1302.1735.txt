    "the currently accepted standard model ( sm ) prediction of the muon magnetic anomaly is @xcite @xmath5 where the first error is from the lowest order hadronic contribution , @xmath6 , the second from all other hadronic pieces , and the third is due to all non - hadronic terms .",
    "in contrast , the average experimental value is @xcite @xmath7 leading to a discrepancy between experiment and theory @xmath8 which is a @xmath9 effect .",
    "another independent analysis of the lowest - order hadronic contribution @xcite gives @xmath10 , which corresponds to a @xmath11 discrepancy between experiment and theory .",
    "+ given that the largest uncertainty in the sm prediction comes from @xmath12 , and that the cross - section data from @xmath13 is used to evaluate this contribution , it is natural to wonder whether the discrepancy @xmath14 could be ( partly ) due to some issue with the @xmath15 data .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact on @xmath6 if the contribution from the @xmath15 data is quenched by including theoretical input in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "this procedure reduces the discrepancy @xmath14 to @xmath4 , i.e. without increasing the error . in the process of following this procedure",
    "it will be shown that there is a clear discrepancy between the ope based approach and the ( unquenched ) @xmath15 data .",
    "these conclusions depend on two assumptions , viz .",
    "( a ) the validity of ( global ) quark - hadron duality , and ( b ) the dimension @xmath16 term in the ope is entirely due to quark mass insertions .",
    "the validity of these assumptions will be critically discussed .",
    "their impact on the hadronic contribution to the running qed coupling , and hence the sm fitted higgs boson mass , will be investigated in the appendix .",
    "we begin by defining the light - quark electromagnetic current correlator @xmath17 , @xmath18 where the electromagnetic current is @xmath19 , with the sum running over the light quarks @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the quark charges . @xmath17",
    "is analytic in the entire complex squared energy @xmath22-plane , except for a branch cut along the positive real axis .",
    "unitarity implies the optical theorem @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the normalized @xmath15 cross - section . the lowest order hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon",
    "is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a well - known weight function .",
    "about @xmath27 of the contribution to eq .",
    "comes from the low - energy region below @xmath28 .",
    "here perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is not valid , and cross - section data from @xmath15 experiments is normally used to perform the integration , followed by pqcd above @xmath28 @xcite and up to the charm - quark threshold .",
    "regarding the heavy - quark contribution , it is even possible to calculate it entirely in pqcd as shown recently @xcite .",
    "therefore we shall concentrate on the low energy region @xmath29 , and discuss how the ope could be used to quench the contribution of the @xmath15 data .",
    "+ we begin by considering cauchy s theorem in the complex @xmath22-plane @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary analytic function .",
    "next , we invoke quark - hadron duality to replace @xmath17 by @xmath32 in the integral around the circle , where @xmath32 is the correlator in the framework of the ope .",
    "one can write the low energy piece of eq . , @xmath33 , as @xmath34r(s)\\,ds\\nonumber\\\\ & + 6\\pi i\\oint_{|s|=s_0}p(s)\\pi_{\\text{ope}}(s)\\,ds   \\;.\\label{eq : fesr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the low energy contribution written in this form , one can choose a suitable @xmath31 to quench the contribution of the @xmath15 data , for the price of having to perform a contour integral .",
    "there are a number of relevant considerations in choosing @xmath31 .",
    "first , each power @xmath35 present in @xmath31 will involve a dimension @xmath36 term in the ope . as all terms beyond dimension @xmath37",
    "are currently poorly known , one should avoid them by considering only kernels of the form @xmath38 , thus implying contributions from only dimension @xmath39 condensates .",
    "higher dimensional terms would only contribute through logarithmic terms at order @xmath40 , which are expected to be heavily suppressed @xcite .",
    "the second consideration is to note that the data in the range @xmath41 is particularly badly known .",
    "the data in this region have the largest uncertainties , and some of the channels have not even been measured yet ( for example the process @xmath42 ) , and their contributions must be estimated using isospin relations .",
    "therefore , we shall fix the constants @xmath43 in @xmath31 by demanding that the contribution in the region @xmath41 be minimized .",
    "in particular , that the quantity @xmath44 be minimized .",
    "this uniquely fixes @xmath31 as @xmath45 one can appreciate from fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] that with this choice of @xmath31 all the data in the interval @xmath46 is suppressed by a factor of * at least * 2.5 .",
    "it should be stressed that our final results are highly insensitive to the use of other fitting methods , e.g. least - square fits . as a final comment on the choice of @xmath31 , and in connection with the region @xmath47 , the kernel @xmath26 is approximately proportional to @xmath48 , implying that @xmath26 gets flatter with increasing @xmath22 .",
    "the flatter the kernel , the wider the range in @xmath22 allowing for a linear fit . quenching data at @xmath49 over a sufficiently wide range is not feasible .",
    "the other issue with attempting to suppress the @xmath50 region is that @xmath51 will be larger than @xmath26 in the poorly known region @xmath52 , thus emphasizing these data",

    "it turns out that the uncertainty in the gluon condensate by far dominates over that of the second term in eq.(13 ) .",

    "systematic errors from the same experimental group were conservatively taken to be 100% correlated .",

    "for instance , using the kernel of @xcite gives @xmath97 , which has a different sign from the leading - order contribution .",
    "using the same procedure as above , we find the following difference between results from the modified kernel approach , @xmath98 , and the standard approach , @xmath99 , @xmath100 where no error is given , as it is not significant given the uncertainty in eq . .",
    "adding this next - to - leading order result to eq . and recalculating the discrepancy , eq . , gives @xmath101 which is a lower @xmath102 effect .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the method followed here to determine the leading hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly relies on two basic assumptions , i.e. ( a ) ( global ) quark - hadron duality , and ( b ) the absence of a dimension @xmath16 term in the ope , beyond well known pqcd quark mass corrections .",
    "we discuss their validity in this section .",
    "the ope beyond perturbation theory in the deep euclidean region , involving a parameterization of confinement in terms of quark and gluon vacuum condensates , is one of the two pillars of the qcd sum rule method .",
    "this allows for analytic determinations of hadronic parameters , as well as of quark masses and the strong coupling @xcite .",
    "however , the contour integral in eq . involves an integration of the ope expression for the correlator near the minkowski axis , a potential source of difficulties as first pointed out in the pioneering paper @xcite .",

    "these data lie slightly above the pqcd prediction for @xmath117 ( see fig.8 in @xcite ) .",
    "since our modified integration kernel emphasizes , instead of quenching the impact of data in this energy range , the result for @xmath116 increases .",
