    "in a recent study @xcite it was observed that the properties of a solid that is confined in a narrow channel can change drastically for small changes in applied external strain .",
    "this was related to structural changes at the microscopic level such as a change in the number of layers of atoms in the confining direction .",
    "these effects occur basically as a result of the small ( few atomic layers in one direction ) dimensions of the system considered and confinement along some direction . a similar layering transition , in which the number of smectic layers in a confined liquid changes in discrete steps with increase in the wall - to - wall separation , was noted in @xcite . both @xcite",
    "look at equilibrium properties while @xcite looks at changes in the dynamical properties .",
    "an interesting question is , how are transport properties , such as electrical and thermal conductivity , affected for these nanoscale systems under strain ?",
    "this question is also important to address in view of the current interest in the properties of nanosystems , both from the point of view of fundamentals and applications @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of strain on the heat current across a two - dimensional ( 2d ) `` solid '' formed by a few layers of interacting atoms confined in a long narrow channel .",
    "we note here that , in the thermodynamic limit it is expected that there can be no true solid phase in this quasi - one - dimensional system .",
    "however for a long but finite channel , which is our interest here , and at a high packing fraction the fluctuations are small and the system behaves like a solid . we will use the word `` solid '' in this sense .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the anomalous failure , under strain , of a narrow strip of a 2d solid formed by hard disks confined within hard walls [  see fig .",
    "[ cartoon ]  ] was studied .",
    "sharp jumps in the stress vs strain plots were observed .",
    "these were related to structural changes in the system which underwent transitions from solid - to - smectic - to - modulated liquid phases @xcite . in the present paper we study changes in the thermal conductance of this system as it undergoes elastic deformation and failure through a layering transition caused by external elongational strains applied in different directions .    the calculation of heat conductivity in a many body system is a difficult problem . the kubo formula and boltzmann kinetic theory provide formal expressions for the thermal conductivity . in practice",
    "these are usually difficult to evaluate without making drastic approximations .",
    "more importantly a large number of recent studies @xcite indicate that the heat conductivity of low - dimensional systems infact diverge .",
    "it is then more sensible to calculate directly the heat current or the conductance of the system rather than the heat conductivity . in this paper",
    "we propose a simple - minded calculation of the heat current which can be expected to be good for a hard disk ( or hard spheres in the three dimensional case ) system in the solid phase .",
    "this reproduces some qualitative features of the simulations and gives values for the current which are of the correct order of magnitude .",

    "the hard walls of the channel are located at @xmath9 and @xmath0 and we take periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath10direction . the length of the channel along the @xmath10direction is @xmath11 and the area is @xmath12 .",
    "the confining walls are maintained at two different temperatures ( @xmath13 at @xmath9 and @xmath14 at @xmath0 ) so that the temperature difference @xmath15 gives rise to a heat current in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "initially we start with channel dimensions @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that the system is in a phase corresponding to a unstrained solid with a triangular lattice structure .",
    "we then study the heat current in this system when it is strained ( a ) along the @xmath10direction and ( b ) along the @xmath18direction .",
    "we perform an event - driven collision time dynamics @xcite simulation of the hard disk system .",
    "the upper and lower walls are maintained at temperatures @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( in arbitrary units ) respectively by imposing maxwell boundary condition @xcite at the two confining walls .",
