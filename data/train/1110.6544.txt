    "in most of the developed world neonatal care has been organized into networks of cooperating hospitals ( units ) in order to provide better and more efficient care for the local population . a neonatal or perinatal network in the uk offers all ranges of neonatal care referred to as intensive , high dependency and special care through level @xmath0 to level @xmath1 units .",
    "recent studies show that perinatal networks in the uk have been struggling with severe capacity crisis @xcite .",
    "expanding capacity by number of beds in the unit , in general , is not an option since neonatal care is an unusually expensive therapy .",
    "reducing capacity is not an option either , as this would risk sick neonates being denied admission to the unit or released prematurely .",
    "consequently , determining cot capacity has become a major concern for perinatal network managers in the uk .",
    "queueing models having zero buffer also referred to as ` loss models ' @xmath2 have been widely applied in hospital systems and intensive care in particular ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite proposed an m / m / c/0 loss model for capacity management in an operating theatre - intensive care unit .",
    "@xcite developed an overflow model with loss framework for capacity planning in intensive care units while @xcite developed a loss network model for a neonatal unit , and extended the model framework to a perinatal network in @xcite .",
    "these models assume that inter - arrival times and length of stay follow exponential distributions .",
    "queueing models with exponential inter - arrival and service times are easiest to study , since such processes are markov chains .",
    "however , length of stay distribution in intensive care may be highly skewed @xcite .",
    "performance measures of a queueing system with non - zero buffer are insensitive to service time distribution provided that the arrival process is poisson @xcite .",
    "this insensitivity property is , in general , no longer valid in the case of zero buffer or loss systems @xcite .",
    "many approaches have been found towards generalizing such processes since erlang introduced the m / m / c/0 model for a simple telephone network and derived the well - known loss formula that carries his name in 1917 @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the loss system with general arrival pattern ( gi / m / c/0 ) through laplace transform .",
    "nowadays there has been a growing interest in loss systems where both arrival and service patterns are generalized ( gi / g / c/0 ) .",
    "the theoretical investigation of the gi / g / c/0 loss model through the theory of random point processes has attracted many researchers .",
    "@xcite gave a method for approximating the gi / gi / c/0 queue by means of the gi / gi/@xmath3 queue , while @xcite applied a similar approximation under heavy traffic .",
    "@xcite examined the continuity property of the model , and established an equivalence between arrival and departure probability .",
    "@xcite gave an approximation method for the batch - arrival gi@xmath4}$]/g / c / n queue which is applicable when the traffic intensity is less than one .",
    "the m / g / c / n and the gi / g / c / n queue have also been studied widely ; for a comparison of methods , see @xcite .",
    "although many studies have been found in the literature , no simple expression for the steady state distribution is available for a gi / g / c/0 system .",
    "@xcite provided the exact solution for the gi / gi / c/0 system expressing the inter - arrival and service time by matrix exponential distribution .",
    "the method is computationally intensive and often includes imaginary components in the expression ( which are unrealistic ) .",
    "diffusion approximations , which require complicated laplace transforms have also been used for analyzing gi / g / c / n queues ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite derived a transform - free expression for the analysis of the gi / g/1/n queue through the decomposed little s formula .",
    "a two - moment approximation was proposed to estimate the steady state queue length distribution . using the same approximation , @xcite extended the system for the multi - server finite buffer queue based on the system equations derived by @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed a heuristic approach for the numerical analysis of gi / g / c/0 queueing systems with examples of the two - phase coxian distribution .    in this paper",
    "we derive a generalized loss network model with overflow for a network of neonatal hospitals extending the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "since some model parameters can not be computed practically , a two - moment based approximation method is applied for the steady state analysis as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the model is then applied to the north central london perinatal network , one of the busiest network in the uk .",
    "data obtained from each hospital ( neonatal unit ) of the network have been used to check the performance of the model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we first discuss a typical perinatal network and then develop a generalized loss model with overflow for the network . the steady state distribution and expression for rejection and overflow probabilities",
    "have been derived for each level of care of the neonatal units .",
    "application of the model and numerical results are presented in section [ section4 ] .",

    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the typical patient flow in a level @xmath0 unit .",
    "a level @xmath0 unit may also have an intensive therapy unit ( itu ) which provides short - term intensive care to neonates , and the unit may then be referred to as ` level @xmath0 unit with itu ' .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the structure of a level @xmath0 unit with itu .",
    "level @xmath5 units consist of a scbu and a hdu where neonates can receive high dependency care such as breathing via continuous positive airway pressure or intravenous feeding .",
    "these units may also provide short - term intensive care .",
    "a level @xmath1 unit provides all ranges of neonatal care and consists of an scbu , an hdu and an nicu where neonates will often be on a ventilator and need constant care to be kept alive . level @xmath5 and level @xmath1 units may also have some transitional care ( tc ) cots , which may be used to tackle overflow and rejection from scbu .",
    "although level @xmath5 and level @xmath1 units have similar structures level @xmath5 units might not have sufficient clinician support for the nicu . nicu are hdu are often merged in level @xmath5 and level @xmath1 units for higher utilization of cots . in level @xmath5 or level @xmath1 units ,",
    "nicu - hdu neonates are sometimes initially cared at scbu when all nicu cots are occupied .",
    "similarly scbu neonates are cared at nicu - hdu or tc , depending upon the availability of cots , staff and circumstances .",
    "this temporary care is provided by staffing a cot with appropriate nurse and equipment resources , and will be referred to as ` overflow ' .",
    "rejection occurs only when all cots are occupied ; in such cases neonates are transferred to another neonatal unit .",
    "patient flows in a typical level @xmath1 or level @xmath5 unit are depicted in figure [ fig4 ] . unlike for level @xmath1/level @xmath5 units",
    ", overflow does not occur in level @xmath0 units with itu .    the underlying admission , discharge and transfer policies of a perinatal network are described below .    1 .",
    "all mothers expecting birth @xmath6 week of gestational age or all neonates with @xmath6 week of gestational age are transferred to a level @xmath1 unit .",
    "mothers expecting birth @xmath7 but @xmath8 week of gestational age or all neonates of the same gestational age are transferred to a level @xmath5 unit depending upon the booked place of delivery .",
    "all neonatal units accept neonates for special care booked at the same unit .",
    "neonates admitted into units other than their booked place of delivery are transferred back to their respective neonatal unit receiving after the required level of care .",
    "now we shall develop a generalized loss network framework for a perinatal network with level @xmath0 , level @xmath5 and level @xmath1 units . to obtain the steady state behavior of the network ,",
    "we first decompose the whole network into a set of subnetworks ( i.e. , each neonatal units ) due to higher dimensionality , then we derive the steady state solution and expression of rejection probability for each of the units . when analyzing a particular sub - network in isolation , back transfers are combined with new arrivals to specifically take into account the dependencies between units .",
    "cot capacity for the neonatal units may be determined based on the rejection probabilities at each level of care and overflow to temporary care of the units .",
    "a level @xmath0 unit consists typically of a scbu . therefore , assuming no waiting space and first come first served ( fcfs ) discipline , a level @xmath0 unit can be modelled as a gi / g / c/0 system .",

    "adding back transfers , we can easily obtain the steady state distribution for a level @xmath5 unit .",
    "we apply the model to the case of a perinatal network in london which is the north central london perinatal network ( nclpn ) .",
    "the network consists of five neonatal units : uclh ( level @xmath1 ) , barnet ( level @xmath5 ) , whittington ( level @xmath5 ) , royal free ( level @xmath0 with itu ) and chase farm ( level @xmath0 ) .",
    "the underlying aim of the network is to achieve capacity so that 95% women and neonates may be cared for within the network .",
    "data on admission and length of stay were provided by each of the units . since the data did not contain the actual arrival rate and the rejection probability for the units we estimated the actual arrival rates using simul8^^ @xcite , a computer simulation package designed to model and measure performances of a stochastic service system .",
    "table [ tab1 ] presents mean length of stay and estimated mean inter - arrival times for each level of care at uclh , barnet , whittington , royal free and chase farm neonatal units for the year @xmath104 .",
    "then we also use simulation ( simul8 ) to estimate the rejection probabilities for each level of care of the units for various arrival and discharge patterns .",
    "we refer to these estimates as ` observed ' rejection probabilities .      in this section rejection probabilities",
    "are estimated for all five units in the nclpn through the application of the model formulae in section [ section3 ] .",
    "an extensive numerical investigation has been carried out for a variety of inter - arrival and length of stay distributions to test the performance of the model and the approximation method .",
    "table [ tab2 ] compares the ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities at each level of care for uclh , barnet , whittington , royal free and chase farm neonatal units for various combinations of inter - arrival time and length of stay distributions .",
    "namely , exponential ( m ) , two - phase hyper - exponential ( h@xmath105 ) and two - phase erlang ( e@xmath105 ) distributions are considered . to compare ` observed ' rejection probabilities with estimated rejection probabilities when one of these probabilities are @xmath106 or more , we define ` absolute percentage error ' ( ape ) as the absolute deviation between ` observed ' and estimated rejection probability divided by ` observed ' rejection probability and then multiplied by 100 .",
    "rejection probabilities below @xmath106 are normally considered statisfactor . for this reason",
    "we have not reported the ape when both ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities are less than @xmath106 .    the ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities are close for the uclh unit . at nicu - hdu ,",
    "the highest ` observed ' rejection probability is occurred for e@xmath105/e@xmath105/c/0 , and the estimated rejected probability is also highest for the same arrival and discharge patterns with an absolute percentage error ( ape ) @xmath107 . the lowest ` observed ' rejection probability is @xmath108 for the h@xmath105/e@xmath105/c/0 while the estimated rejection probability is @xmath109 with an ape @xmath110 . at scbu for e@xmath105/m / c/0 ,",
    "the ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities are @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively , with an ape @xmath113 . at barnet nicu - hdu , the ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities are close with a varying apes from @xmath114@xmath115 .",
    "for barnet scbu the ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities are all less than @xmath106 and relatively close to each other . both the uclh nicu - hdu and scbu and barnet nicu - hdu would require additional cots to keep the rejection level low and achieve a @xmath106 target .",
    "rejection probabilities from both nicu - hdu and scbu at the whittington neonatal unit are below @xmath106 regardless of the combination of inter - arrival time and length of stay distributions , which indicates that the neonatal unit is performaing well with 12 nicu , 16 scbu and 5 tc cots .",
    "the ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities at royal free itu and scbu and chase farm scbu are close to each other .",
    "the results in table [ tab2 ] suggest that royal free itu and scbu and chase farm scbu require extra cots to decrease the rejection level .    through our extensive numerical investigations",
    "we observe that the rejection probability often varies greatly according to arrival and discharge patterns .",
    "the number of cots required will also vary depending upon arrival and discharge patterns .",
    "therefore , one should take into account the actual arrival and discharge patterns for accurate capacity planning of neonatal units rather than approximating by markovian arrival and discharge patterns . to achieve a ` 95% ' admission acceptance target uclh nicu - hdu and scbu",
    ", barnet nicu - hdu , royal free itu and scbu , and chase farm scbu need to increase their number of cots .",
    "we have also observed that performance of the proposed generalized capacity planning model improves as the squared coefficient of variation values of inter - arrival and length of stay get closer to @xmath0 ( recall that our approximation is exact for the markovian inter - arrival and length of stay case in which squared coefficient of variation values of inter - arrival and length of stay are both @xmath0 ) and as @xmath116 gets larger ( i.e. , under heavy traffic ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that as @xmath116 gets larger , the period during which all the cots are busy tends to get longer .",
    "as such a busy period gets longer , arrival and departure points of arrivals tend to become more and more like arbitrary points in time . as such",
    ", the approximation is likely to get more accurate .",
    "planning capacity accurately has been an important issue in the neonatal sector because of the high cost of care , in particular .",
    "markovian arrival and length of stay can provide only approximate estimates which may often underestimate or overestimate the required capacity .",
    "the underestimation of cots may increase the rejection level , which in turn may be life - threatening or cause expensive transfers for high risk neonates , hence increase risk for vulnerable babies . on the other hand , overestimation may cause under - utilization of cots , and potential waste of resources .    in this paper a generalized framework for determining cot capacity of a perinatal network was derived .",
    "after decomposing the whole network into neonatal units , each unit was analyzed separately .",
    "expressions for the stationary distribution and for rejection probabilities were derived for each neonatal unit .",
    "an approximation method was suggested to obtain the steady state rejection probabilities .",
    "the model formulation was then applied to the neonatal units in the nclpn .",
    "a variety of inter - arrival and length of stay distributions in the neonatal units has been considered for numerical experimentation .",
    "the ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities were close ( ape typically less than 20% ) for all hospital units when rejection probabilities were @xmath106 or more . when ` observed ' rejection probabilities were less than @xmath106 , as for the barnet scbu and both the whittington nicu - hdu and scbu , the ape increased rapidly to beyond 50%",
    ". however , since these values are less than or close to 0.05 , they do not have an impact on management decisions regarding the number of cots .",
    "in contrast , when ` observed ' rejection probabilities are high , then the estimated values become close to each other .",
    "the ` observed ' and estimated rejection probabilities were , in general , close for high traffic intensities .",
    "as traffic intensity drops the absolute percent error increases quickly . in most cases ,",
    "the absolute percent error becomes small for markovian arrival and length of stay patterns .",
    "we know that service time distribution is insensitive for delay systems if the arrival process is poisson .",
    "however , the property is no longer valid for loss systems .",
    "the model results as seen in table [ tab2 ] also confirm this sensitivity property .",
    "the main advantage of the model framework is that arrival and discharge pattern do not need to hold the markov property .",
    "the model is based on the first two moments and requires no distributional assumption .",
    "this two - moment approximation techniques performs reasonably well in terms of accuracy ( ape ) and is fast .",
    "the method is exactly markovian for equal mean and variance .",
    "the numerical results show that the model can be used as a capacity planning tool for perinatal networks for non - markovian arrival and discharge patterns as well as markovian patterns .",
    "if good estimates of the first two moments are available , then the generalized model can be used to determine the required cot capacity in a perinatal network for given level of rejection probabilities .",
