    "the modeled dems , which have a narrow distribution , are plotted as red dots with a similar temperature offset .",
    "since there are heating events occurring almost continuously compared to the cooling time of the strands , the loop has no time to cool down completely and the temperature stays steady , with small fluctuations . because of this reason , all the emission comes from a narrow distribution of temperatures , which is reflected in the modeled results .",

    "the model produces a well constrained dem that is higher than the observed dem , although the observations are less constrained at those temperatures .",

    "the level of fluctuations and the short term trend in the red curve are higher than what is seen in the observations .",
    "furthermore , if the number of heating events are fewer than what is considered here ( five ) , but with stronger impulses , the fluctuations now become noticeably large , and the observations should reveal these features .      for cases 1 and 2",
    "we adjusted the model parameters such that the dem - weighted temperature ( @xmath23 ) roughly matches the observed temperature for region 1 .",
    "however , we find that the overall structure and features of the predicted dem(@xmath1 ) does not match the dem(@xmath1 ) derived from aia observations . therefore ,",
    "neither of these models are fruitful in describing the @xmath10 mk emerging loops in the quiet sun .",
    "we suggest that the heating events may have a broad range , and/ or a population of different heating amplitudes , influencing different strands .    from the observational point of view , each strand in the loop is dynamically evolving and the lifetime of this unit is not clearly known .",
    "new strands emerge with the photospheric flux and replace the older ones in the loop .",
    "to investigate this problem further , a hybrid heating model ( case 3 ) has been considered . in this model , we start with a simple assumption that 20% of the strands are rapidly heated with an excess amount of average heating rate of fifty times more than the remaining 80% of the loops .",

    "the fairly well reproduced quantities from this model suggest that a coronal loop , which has a bundle of many strands , can be heated by considering different amplitudes of medium frequency heating events .",
    "this is certainly a plausible assumption because , these emerging bipoles evolve continuously , and various reasons can contribute to different heating episodes .",
    ".[dem3aa],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    alternatively , we can also assume that each strand spends 20% of its time being heated to higher values ( similar to the 20% strands case described previously ) , and the remaining time to lower values .",

    "the dems and @xmath1 are plotted in figure  [ dem3b ] . the way we consider the volume expansion is that , each strand slowly expands for about 350 minutes and then the expansion saturates to a constant value .",
    "this constant value matches with the length , and radius of the strand chosen in all the cases . it is observed that for a slowly expanding loop , the adiabatic cooling effect can be negligible .",
    "there are two competing effects here .",
    "under equilibrium conditions , the temperature of the loop increases with the length . in our slowly expanding loop ,",
    "the cooling is compensated for with the length increase .",
    "but in reality , the rate of volume expansion can be entirely different , and more rapid than what we considered here .",
    "these effects become important when changes in the loop pressure and density due to expansion alone , and heating are comparable .      in the above ebtel - based models",
    "the emission is assumed to come from the coronal portion of the loop .",
    "ebtel also predicts the emission from the transition region ( tr ) to model the lower temperatures .",
    "however , the predicted tr emission is strong and rather flat relative to the corona .",
    "inclusion of up to @xmath41 of the tr emission will not affect the results , but adding more contribution from the tr requires stronger heating to match the observed emission weighted temperature .",
    "this results in a strong emission from the higher temperature , which is not observed .",
    "one possible reason for the strong tr dems produced by ebtel is that the model assumes a constant cross - section over the length of the loop , whereas the loops on the sun have significant expansion factors ( @xmath42 ) between the loop footpoints in the tr and the loop top in the corona .",
    "potential field modeling of active regions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates @xmath43 , depending on height , and similar expansion factors may occur on the quiet sun .",
    "when the cross - sectional area @xmath44 of a loop increases with height , the volume of plasma at coronal temperatures is increased relative to that at tr temperatures , so the slope of the dem(@xmath1 ) curve becomes steeper and more consistent with observations .    to demonstrate this effect",
    ", we developed a simple loop model for the case that the cross - section @xmath44 varies along the loop .",
    "the heating is assumed to be steady in time .",
    "the model is described in appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] .",
    "it allows us to compute the dem(@xmath1 ) for a single loop with a given expansion factor @xmath42 , half - length @xmath45 , and peak temperature @xmath46 ( we use @xmath47 mm ) .",
    "we repeat the calculation for different peak temperatures ( @xmath48 ) and compute the average dem(@xmath1 ) . in figure  [ expan ]",
    "we plot the dem results for @xmath49 ( left panel ) and @xmath50 ( right panel ) .",
    "note that for a loop with uniform cross - section ( @xmath49 ) , dem(@xmath1 ) is flat for @xmath51 k , similar to the dems predicted with the ebtel code  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , for @xmath50 the peak value of the dem in the corona is about 8 times its value in the tr , similar to the observed dems ( see figure  [ 4dems ] ) .",
    "these results suggest that the overall shape of the observed dem can be very well reproduced with a collection of hot loops ( @xmath52 1 mk ) that have significant expansion factors ( @xmath53 5 -10 ) . however , the peak value of the dem as predicted by the model is larger than the observed value by a factor of about 100",
    ". therefore , the loops must fill only a small fraction of the coronal volume ( filling factor @xmath54 % ) .",

    "there is no clear relation between the two quantities , suggesting that , for these small emerging bipoles , the surrounding regions in photosphere and higher atmosphere play an important role in the loop evolution .    to estimate the energetics involved in the formation of these loops we use a hydrodynamic loop model ( ebtel ) to simulate the dems and emission weighted temperatures .",
    "we assume that a loop is a bundle of one hundred strands , each having a length of about 18 mm , and a uniform radius of 0.1 mm .",
    "furthermore , each strand is randomly heated and the average effect describes the properties of the observed loop . to this end",
    ", we tested three simple heating events with varied heating frequencies as described in sections  [ sec : case1 ] ,  [ sec : case2 ] ,  [ sec : case3a ] , and  [ sec : case3b ] .",
    "the average heating input in our study ( @xmath59 10@xmath60 ergs cm@xmath39 s@xmath14 ) is in close agreement with the approximate energy losses observed in the quiet sun .",
    "the @xmath62 values of the fluctuations in @xmath23 ( mk ) are about 0.25 , 0.16 , 0.55 , and 0.24 for the observations , cases 1 , 2 , and 3(a ) respectively .    in case 3 , we tested the following sub - cases : ( a ) 20% of the strands are heated to high heating values all the time , and the remaining strands are heated to low heating values ( section  [ sec : case3a ] ) , ( b ) all strands are heated to high heating values 20% of their time ( section  [ sec : case3a ] ) , ( c ) similar to case 3(a ) , but for expanding strands to account for the adiabatic cooling effects ( section  [ sec : case3b ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the cases 3(a ) , and 3(b ) are equivalent and match the observations fairly well .",
    "this suggests that there may be a range of heating events operating in the loops at a given time . in the cases 2 and 3(b ) , though there are only a few large heating events , the essential difference between the two cases is that , unlike in case 2 , the duration of a single high heating phase in case 3(b ) itself is longer compared to typical plasma cooling time ( making case 3(b ) statistically a steady heating model ) .",
    "this allows case 3(b ) to find a dem peak at higher temperatures .",
    "the model described in case 3 is the best model we could obtained with in the scope of the present work . mixing low and medium heating at various proportions with different average heating rates",
    "show discrepancy , and do not fit observations completely .",
    "these results are based on the assumption that the emitting plasma has coronal origin .",
    "alternatively , we also argued that to include tr emission in the model , it is important to consider an expansion of the loop from tr to corona . in this scenario , a steady heating model for loops with loop apex temperature @xmath63",
    "k can well reproduce the observed dems , assuming @xmath64 1% plasma filling factor .    reliability of aia dems is a matter of debate",
    ".   studied the contribution of spectral lines and continuum emission to the aia euv channels using chianti atomic database .",
    "they emphasize that the contribution of particular spectral lines and continuum emission can affect the interpretation of the observed features , when aia channels are used to observe regions other than those for which the channels were designed .",
    "compared aia dems with the _",
    "hinode_/eis observations of active regions .",
    "they found discrepancies between the derived dems .",
    "this is mainly due to the multi - thermal nature of aia response curves , which have contributions from cooler components .",
    "the cooler emission below 6.0 ( in log @xmath1 ) , seen in our observations could be due to the double - peaked nature of aia responses as suggested by  .",
    "empirically modified filter response curves for aia are derived to address some of these issues however , the role of this possible contamination in a already cool loop ( like the one originating from a small bipole in the quiet sun ) , as compared to the warm loops in the hotter active region has to be further examined .",
    "the models presented in this work assume that the strands are heated uniformly over their entire length .",
    "alternatively , the strand can be heated in a non - uniform manner with localized and concentrated heat sources . if the heating is concentrated at the loop footpoints , this may lead to the loss of equilibrium in the energy balancing terms , as the radiative losses in the coronal section dominate the downward conductive flux .",
    "this will trigger the runaway cooling due to strong radiative losses and a condensation is formed in the coronal loops  .",
    "this is a well studied phenomenon in the formation of solar prominences  @xcite .",
    "recently , based upon the observed properties of the hot , and warm loops in active regions ,  @xcite have argued that the high concentration of heating low in the corona , and the steady or quasi - steady heating models ( leading to thermal nonequilibrium ) can be ruled out .",
    "however ,   claim that a steady supply of energy is required even in the events of condensation in the corona , to keep the coronal pressure .",
    "they also suggested that thermal non - equilibrium can be a valuable tool in investigating the plasma dynamics and heat input in the regions where condensation forms .",
    "the studies on the role and importance of the thermal non - equilibrium in the formation of condensation in the short quiet sun loops are not extensive .  ,",
    "discussed in detail the numerical simulations of condensation and catastrophic cooling of short tr 10 mm loops , and longer 100 mm coronal loops , respectively .",
    "they considered heating that has exponential height dependence along the loop , and further suggested that the catastrophic cooling is initiated by the loss of equilibrium at the loop apex due to concentration of heating at the footpoints , but not due to a drastic decrease of the total loop heating .",
    "note that the strands in a loop may interact in a very complex manner , and their response to the condensation is the key objective to be addressed .",
    "further work is necessary to get a better picture of the nature and location of the heating , observational signatures of condensation , and finally the role of magnetic field in this whole process .",
    "a complete set of answers for these questions is still elusive and we need more observational constraints to narrow down the possibilities .",
