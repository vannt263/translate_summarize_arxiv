    "when calculating the various ground state properties of fermionic systems , it is important to have fast and accurate ways of evaluating the density matrix . for non - interacting fermions ,",

    ", @xmath1 is either of empirical nature , or the result of a self - consistent calculation .",
    "the standard method for computing the density matrix requires diagonalizing @xmath1 , an operation whose computational complexity scales cubically with the number of electronic degrees of freedom @xmath2 . having a linear scaling scheme to obtain this quantity is a key step for modeling larger systems , thus making possible the computational study of a vast class of problems ,",
    "whose behavior can not be described by smaller models .",
    "areas in which such a technique would have a major impact include nanotechnology and biochemistry , to name but a couple .",
    "several methods have been proposed to circumvent diagonalization@xcite .",
    "these methods are based on the nearsightedness principle@xcite , which guarantees that in the @xmath3 limit the matrices needed to compute the fermi operator will become sparse . among the different approaches that have been proposed",
    ", we might cite divide - and - conquer schemes@xcite , density - matrix minimization@xcite , green s function@xcite , maximally localized orbitals@xcite and penalty functions methods@xcite .",
    "the use of sparse matrix algebra eventually leads to linear scaling .",
    "a second class of methods , on which we shall focus here , uses the finite - temperature fermi operator . due to the finite temperature ,",
    "the singularity at the chemical potential @xmath4 is smoothed , thus allowing for an expansion in simpler functions of @xmath1 . since orbital localization is not explicitly exploited",
    ", this class of methods can also be applied to metals .",
    "the earliest attempts in this direction were based on an expansion in chebyshev polynomials@xcite .",
    "the computational cost of this method has been analyzed by baer and head - gordon@xcite , who found that the order @xmath5 of the polynomial needed to achieve a @xmath6 accuracy depends linearly on the width of the hamiltonian spectrum @xmath7 and the electronic temperature @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "this obviously raises some problems when considering hamiltonians with large @xmath7 , such as those arising from dft calculations using plane wave basis sets , or when low temperatures are required .",
    "recently it has been suggested@xcite that fast polynomial summation methods , requiring a number of multiplications @xmath10 , can be applied to fermi operator expansion , leading to the more favorable scaling @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    "we revisit a particular form for the expansion of the fermi operator , which is based on the grand - canonical formalism and developed in a series of recent papers@xcite .",
    "the grand - canonical potential for independent fermions is split into a sum of @xmath12 terms , containing @xmath13 . as a consequence of this decomposition",
    ", the fermi operator can be written exactly as a sum of @xmath12 terms .",
    "the larger the number of terms , the easier the evaluation of the exponential : this implies a tradeoff between the size of @xmath12 and the accuracy of the results . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the analytical properties of this decomposition , finding that a large number of terms are almost ideally conditioned , and that their contribution to the fermi operator can be easily and effectively computed in a single shot with a polynomial expansion .",
    "the remaining few are tackled via a newton - like iterative inversion scheme , which needs to be applied to each term individually but is very efficient in dealing with large @xmath14 . with this hybrid approach",
    ", large values of @xmath12 can be reached at a cost that is modest and independent of the system size .",
    "this result can improve significantly the prefactor of other methods using similar decompositions@xcite .",
    "moreover , using this approach , we achieve a scaling of the operations count with @xmath14 that is sublinear , and competitive with the result of ref.@xcite if their fast summation technique is used . in this way , accurate , low - temperature calculations can be performed .",
    "we use an expansion of the fermi operator based on grand - canonical formalism , which has been developed and employed in several recent works@xcite .",

    "the grand - canonical potential can be written in compact form as @xmath23 .",
    "the observables of interest for the system can be obtained as derivatives of the grand - canonical potential . in particular , the grand - canonical density matrix reads : @xmath24    the decomposition  ( [ eq : density - matrix ] ) is exact for any value of @xmath12 . as @xmath12 increases ,",
    "the exponential @xmath25 is easier to approximate .",
    "however , the number of @xmath18s which have to be inverted increases .",
    "previous works using this approach had to find the best compromise between the length of the expansion and the errors introduced by an approximate evaluation of the matrix exponential , therefore losing the advantage of an exact expansion . in order to find a solution to this problem , it is useful to analyze the properties of the @xmath18s in the large @xmath12 limit .",
    "it turns out that matrices with small @xmath26 are much more difficult to handle than those having a higher index .",
