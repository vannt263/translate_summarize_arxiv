    "graphene  @xcite has now been investigated intensively both theoretically and experimentally to gain a clearer understanding of its properties to see how it can be employed in nanoelectronic device applications .",
    "several review articles have drawn together many aspects of graphene with regard to the role which many - body effects have on their electron transport and optical response properties  @xcite .",
    "however , we still need to explore in greater detail the energy loss when a beam of electrons travels near a single layer or double layers of graphene .",
    "generally , inelastic interactions include phonon excitations , inter and intra - band transitions , plasmon excitations , inner shell ionizations , and cerenkov radiation .",
    "this is a non - trivial challenge which we investigate by considering a model which accounts for only plasma losses and those due to intra - band and inter - band transitions .",
    "the beam of incident electrons is assumed to be focused in a narrow angle with a known , small range of kinetic energies .",
    "some initial work has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite for gapless graphene . in this manuscript ,",
    "our interest is to investigate how the stopping power is affected when a gap opens up between the valence and conduction bands , as may occur , for instance , when graphene is radiated by a circularly polarized electric field ( cpef ) .",
    "electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) has been considered for many systems dating back to ritchie s classic paper@xcite for a slab of dielectric material in the local limit and subsequently generalized to a non - local dielectric function by gumbs and horing  @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality was included in ref .",
    "@xcite through the screening of the electron - electron interaction produced by single - particle excitations and plasmon modes .",

    "@xcite recently adopted the formalism of horing , et al.@xcite for a 2d electron gas and gumbs and balassis  @xcite for a nanotube to the case of gapless graphene with the aid of the polarization function calculated by wunsch , et al .",
    "@xcite for conventional dirac electrons .",
    "there have been several recent papers which considered the effects which a cpef  @xcite , spin - orbit interaction ( soi )  @xcite in suspended graphene or the sublattice symmetry breaking ( ssb ) by an underlying polar substrate  @xcite in epitaxial graphene may have on the energy band structure and plasma excitations  @xcite of a graphene sheet . under these conditions",
    ", there is a gap between the valence and conduction bands as well as between the intra - band and inter - band electron - hole continuum of the otherwise semimetal dirac system .",
    "@xcite additionally , the interplay between the single - particle excitations in the long wavelength limit results in dielectric screening of the coulomb interaction which produces an undamped plasmon mode which appears in the gap separating the two types of electron - hole modes forming a continuum . by this , we mean that a self - sustained collective plasma mode is not supported by exciting _",
    "either _ the intra - band or inter - band single - particle modes only .",
    "furthermore , although the dirac electrons near the @xmath1-points now acquire a non - zero effective mass with a cpef , one still can not produce a long wavelength plasmon mode as it is possible in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) by intra - band excitations only .",
    "these properties of the plasma modes give rise to noticeable differences in the behavior of the stopping power of gapped graphene compared with conventional graphene .",
    "a dynamic energy gap produced by the cpef may be comparable with that induced by a polar substrate .",
    "however , unlike the latter , the gap produced by a cpef is highly tunable .",
    "additionally , those two gap - opening mechanisms may take effect simultaneously .",
    "whenever this occurs , the circular polarization of the electromagnetic field may no longer be required provided that it is in resonance with the ssb gap .",
    "electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) may be employed to ascertain the plasmon frequencies in single and double layer graphene .",
    "this setup comprises an electron / photon mixed pump - probe , with the electron beam being the probe effected by the polarized light whose role is to open the gap .",
    "the raman shift of the scattered electrons provides both particle - hole and plasmon excitation frequencies , which are usually characterized by their spectral weight , a quantity that depends on the transferred energy @xmath2 and momentum @xmath3 .",

    "the central mc mode is characterized by associated energy @xmath5 , with the mode being tuned with the substrate induced gap . here , @xmath6 is the average number of photons in the mode , and depends on specifics of the excitation method .",
    "for example , if the mode is thermally excited then @xmath7 for small thermal energy @xmath8 .",
    "another method of excitation is to use an external circularly polarized laser beam making @xmath6 a function of the external pump intensity .",
    "this dressing method is suitable for gapless free standing graphene . in our formalism , specific details of the method of excitation",

    "a few words must be said about the effective chemical potential for the floquet states , which separates the occupied ( hole - like ) from the unoccupied ( electron - like ) states in quasi - equilibrium .",
    "its role is played by the `` mean '' energy ( see eq.(13 ) in ref.@xcite ) , which depends on the frequency of the light .",
    "it will be used in the next section to define the distribution of the floquet states ( dressed dirac electrons ) .    in conventional semiconductors the optically induced side - bands are responsible for effects such as photon - assisted tunneling@xcite , generation of excitons@xcite , stark@xcite and dynamical frantz - keldish phenomena@xcite . in graphene ,",

    "the shorter wave length plasmon frequency become available in the window , and may be accommodated by smaller energy loss sector .",
    "furthermore , the plasmon branch decreases in frequency as @xmath68 is increased , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , thereby making it more likely to excite plasmons even when the charged particle speed is low , and making gapped graphene to have a higher stopping power than conventional gapless graphene .",
    "on the other hand , the plasmon contribution reaches its maximum for smaller velocities as and the role these collective and particle - hole plasma excitations play in the energy loss are reversed in the high - velocity limit . in this regime where the particle - hole excitations should dominate the window makes the stopping power of gapped graphene being less than when there is no gap .",
