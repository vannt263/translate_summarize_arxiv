    "the high energy behaviour of the total cross sections for the scattering of any two high energy particles has been a subject of great theoretical interest over many decades , beginning from heisenberg  @xcite .",
    "the various bounds one obtains on the rate of the rise of these cross sections are based just on the analyticity properties of scattering amplitudes and do not use any knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the interaction responsible for the scattering .",
    "the most important of all these has been the froissart bound  @xcite , which states that at high energies , the total cross section for a scattering process @xmath1",
    "( @xmath2any final state ) has an upper bound @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the centre of mass energy and @xmath5 is an energy scale .",
    "since the bound can be derived from very general physical arguments , such as the unitarity of the @xmath6 matrix and certain analytical properties of the scattering amplitude , it has to be true in any quantum field theory .",
    "however , to derive this in the context of theories of strong interactions , like qcd , one requires to handle the theory in the non - perturbative regime . as a result , there exist only models and these usually try to incorporate known properties of qcd , the modelling aspect involving assumptions and ansaetze about the non - perturbative regime  @xcite .",
    "in fact , analyses of  @xcite in the framework of the bloch - nordsiek improved eikonalised mini jet model  @xcite indicate a direct relationship between the froissart bound at high energy and the dynamics of ultra soft gluons , i.e. , the behaviour of qcd in the far infrared . an analysis of the high energy behaviour of the available data on total hadronic cross sections , while being completely consistent with the bound , seems to need in the fits the presence of a subleading @xmath0 term to the froissart bound .",
    "various qcd ( inspired ) models use such a subleading term , though there is no theory with a proper explanation of this subleading behaviour  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we attempt to seek a theoretical understanding of this subleading behaviour shown by the data on total cross sections at high energies , using the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the leading term ( froissart bound ) can be derived using ads / cft  @xcite .",
    "the model based on  @xcite describes high energy scattering in a large-@xmath7,large-@xmath8 gauge theory with broken conformal symmetry which is achieved by putting a cut - off in the infra - red ( ir ) . here",
    "@xmath7 is the number of colours and @xmath8 is the t hooft coupling .",
    "when a point mass @xmath9 is placed on the ir boundary , the perturbations in the ads space can be big enough to create a black hole .",
    "the geometrical cross section of such a black hole , whose radius is equal to the ads radius , is the gravity dual of the maximum possible scattering cross section in the field theory . in order to have a more realistic model , which takes into account finite coupling corrections ( in @xmath10 and @xmath11 )",
    ", we can incorporate higher curvature corrections in the dual gravity description .",
    "if we are working perturbatively in the couplings , then the leading correction of this type will be at four derivative order  @xcite .",
    "such terms can be redefined into a single gauss - bonnet term whose coefficient describes a @xmath10 correction  see eg .",
    "@xcite for the dictionary relating the field theory and gravity in such a theory . as we will argue below",
    ", this result will in fact hold for any higher curvature gravity dual based on the results in  @xcite . in  @xcite it",
    "is argued that the corrections due to string modes are exponentially small , so here we will ignore them from the onset .",
    "however it is important to take into account @xmath10 and @xmath11 corrections to ensure that the behaviour of the subleading terms arising from einstein gravity as additional contributions to the froissart bound do not get significantly modified .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider subleading corrections to the froissart bound that arise from such an analysis using the results of  @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of the higher curvature terms in the dual gravity will enable us to see what the finite coupling effects are .",
    "we show that the subleading term in that cross section is indeed @xmath0 , as seems to be required by the fits .",
    "our ads / cft analysis predicts that the coefficient of this subleading term should be negative .",
    "further , if we consider the subleading term coming in the dual impact parameter from einstein gravity , in the dual field theory there is an additional correction to the froissart bound of the form @xmath12 .",
    "a recent work  @xcite also found the same subleading term as a correction to the maximal impact parameter . at high energies",
    ", we expect that the general structure of the subleading terms that we find from ads / cft will be useful in getting better fits to experimental data .",
    "this is precisely what we find .",
    "finally , we use all available data ( including lhc and cosmic ray data ) to conclude that the @xmath0 term significantly improves the fit ( the @xmath13 test is used ) .",
    "also , the data always chooses the coefficient of the @xmath0 term to be negative , confirming our prediction from holography .",
    "in this section , we will review and redo the analysis in  @xcite relating the gravity calculations to the froissart bound in order to find the effects of finite coupling .",
    "a more careful analysis of this can be performed using the results in  @xcite .",
    "since the functional form of the transcendental equation which gives the maximal impact parameter is similar to what we will use , we do not expect that the conclusions we arrive at would change significantly in this case .",

    "indices with latin alphabets ( @xmath48 ) include the radial coordinate @xmath42 as well and are raised ( lowered ) with @xmath49 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the background metric @xmath40 satisfies the einstein s field equations with a negative cosmological constant @xmath50 : @xmath51    we redefine the perturbations to a convenient form @xmath52 and assume that the perturbations are small enough to set @xmath53 we further assume that @xmath54 therefore we are left with ten nonzero components of @xmath55 .",
    "but there are 15 equations of motion and hence we have the freedom to choose the traceless - transverse gauge @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the covariant derivative in the ads@xmath39 background .    the equations of motion for the perturbation can be derived from ( [ eomweyl ] ) using ( [ adseom ] ) . in the traceless - transverse gauge , the linearised equations of motion for @xmath58 are @xmath59 where @xmath60 , using the unperturbed metric .",
    "thus the effect of the @xmath10 correction will be to simply rescale the newton constant .",
    "ads / cft arguments suggest that @xmath61 and so , @xmath62  @xcite , although @xmath63 can not be ruled out .",
    "moreover , in this theory , the first @xmath11 correction arises at eight derivative order through @xmath64 corrections ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) , the result of which from the gravity side will be further subleading .",
    "since we are treating the curvature corrections perturbatively , we can in fact give a stronger argument for the generality of our result based on  @xcite .",
    "notice that in the arguments above , we need to find the linearised equations around ads . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that a very general higher curvature action can be rewritten in the form of a background field expansion around ads .",
    "when this is done , the linearised equations of motion will only be sensitive to the quadratic curvature terms in the background expanded action .",
    "since we are working perturbatively , we can use field redefinitions to get back the gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "hence our claim above will work quite generally with the coefficient @xmath65 related to the two point function of the stress tensors in the field theory . in the general case ,",
    "@xmath65 can be either @xmath66 or @xmath67 so long as it is positive , which is demanded by unitarity of the field theory .",
    "the rest of the analysis thus parallels  @xcite , which we will review below in order to understand the systematics of the subleading terms in the froissart bound .",
    "we are interested in solving for the linearised perturbations @xmath58 which satisfy ( [ eomlinhhat ] ) with a point mass @xmath9 on the ir boundary @xmath43 .",
    "this point mass is a source and its contribution in the action is accounted for by adding a suitable @xmath68 .",
    "the addition of this mass leads to a stress tensor with only one non - zero component @xmath69 but such a @xmath70 is not traceless @xmath71 and hence is not compatible with the equation of motion ( [ eomlinhhat ] ) . in order to make it traceless",
    ", we also add an incompressible gas on the brane , which only generates a pressure @xmath72 and no shear stress ( @xmath73 for @xmath74 ) .",
    "the resultant traceless stress - energy tensor is @xmath75 with this source , the only non - trivial equations of motion are @xmath76    but before we solve ( [ tteom ] ) , we need to specify the boundary conditions . as the @xmath58 s",

    "thus the main conclusions from our analysis are that the structure of the subleading terms which arise from the einstein dual are not altered at finite @xmath10 , @xmath11 and that the subleading term @xmath182 should come with a negative coefficient . notice that in order to reach this conclusion we just needed @xmath183 to be less than the scale @xmath184 arising naturally in the ads / cft calculation and the finite coupling effects ( in @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) to contribute perturbatively ( so that @xmath185 does not become drastically small for instance ) .",
    "we have two predictions from ads / cft .",
    "first that the sign of the @xmath182 is negative and second that the ratio  @xcite between the coefficients of the @xmath186 term to the @xmath12 term is @xmath187 .",
    "we will now confront experimental data with these predictions .",
    "the experimentally measured total hadronic cross section for @xmath188 and @xmath189 scattering events @xmath190 shows an initial decrease and a later rise with the centre of mass energy @xmath4 .",
    "an understanding of this form is beyond the scope of perturbative qcd .",
    "the theory of analyticity of the @xmath6 matrix demands that the hadronic amplitudes be analytic functions in the complex angular momentum @xmath191 . in this plane , the singularities do not depend on the scattering hadrons .",
    "unitarity of partial waves and boundedness of the absorptive part within the lehman ellipse lead to the froissart ( upper ) bound on @xmath190 . also , regge trajectory exchanges and a pomeron exchange seem to play an important role in the description of @xmath190 .",
    "the behaviour of the total cross section was first successfully parametrised by donnachie and landschoff ( dl )  @xcite . using regge - pomeron theory , they proposed a sum of two powers to describe the then available data : @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are parameters and @xmath195 should be equal for @xmath196 and @xmath197 . but as new data in a higher energy regime became available , the dl parameterisation became insufficient .",
    "arguments from crossing symmetry , analyticity and unitarity have since been used to modify the dl parameterisation and provide a satisfactory description of the data ( for example , see  @xcite ) .",
    "an understanding of @xmath188 and @xmath189 scattering is not only intrinsically interesting , but also leads to important insights into @xmath198 and @xmath199 ( @xmath21 = photon ) scattering processes ( eg .  @xcite ) .",
    "it is obvious that ( [ shortsigma ] ) will be a better fit to experimental data than just the @xmath200 term , because of the bigger parameter space available .",
    "but the question one should ask is whether the improvement to the fit is just because there are more parameters in the theory or whether the inclusion of the correction terms is really necessary to improve the fit .",
    "the answer to this question can be given by figuring out whether the terms are statistically significant in the @xmath13 test .",
    "a good parametrisation of the data separates the cross section into two parts : a piece which saturates to a constant value and a piece which accounts for the rise  @xcite .",
    "the first piece contains a constant term due to the pomeron and a regge term decreasing as @xmath201 .",
    "two such regge terms are required , representing the @xmath65-even and @xmath65-odd exchanges .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath202  @xcite .",
    "the second piece comes from a triple pole at @xmath203 , which produces @xmath204 and @xmath0 terms in the total cross section  @xcite . at large energies",
    ", the regge terms do not contribute .",
    "the above mentioned logarithmic piece certainly dominates asymptotically , but plays an important role at all energy values .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fitted functional form has to describe the early fall of the cross section with the energy as well as the common ( for @xmath188 and @xmath205 ) constant value from where the high energy rise begins .",
    "recently , the determination of the energy scale of the logarithmic terms has been shown to further contribute a @xmath12 term to the total hadronic cross section  @xcite  .",
    "consequently , we have simultaneously fitted @xmath190 experimental data points to the following functional form : @xmath206 where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are fitting parameters   is sometimes set to @xmath209 ( for example in  @xcite . ) . here",
    "we do not assume @xmath209 , but rather we show from the fits that @xmath210 ( see table [ paramtable ] ) . ] .",
    "a single set of these parameters accounts for both @xmath188 and @xmath189 data .",
    "it is important to note that the term @xmath211 in ( [ fit1 ] ) plays a fundamental role in the simultaneous description of @xmath188 and @xmath189 scattering .",
    "this term accounts for the difference between @xmath188 and @xmath189 scattering in the low energy region while ensuring that a unique set of parameters is used in the high energy region , where there is little difference between the two sets of data   and @xmath189 data without @xmath211 lead to different values of the parameters @xmath212 relevant to the description of the data at high energies in the two cases .",
    "since we want to describe both @xmath188 and @xmath213 data with the _ same _ high energy parameters , we do not perform such separate fits .",
    "it should be stated however , that the conclusion about the sign of the @xmath214 term that we draw in the end is unchanged even then . ] .",
    "we also consider simpler fits by constraining the value of some of these fitting parameters : @xmath215 the analyticity of these @xmath216 s enforces the constraint  @xcite @xmath217    the fit ( [ fit1 ] ) takes the functional form used by  @xcite and adds the term @xmath218 to it .",
    "the fits ( [ fit2])- ( [ fit4 ] ) are required to study whether correction terms found from gauge / gravity duality in the previous section ( see equation ( [ shortsigma ] ) ) lead to a better description of the data .",
    "setting @xmath219 gev allows us to exploit the rich sample of low energy data just above the resonance region .",
    "the goodness of the fits has been estimated with the chi - squared value per degree of freedom : @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the number of data points considered and @xmath222 is the number of parameters in the fit . the chi - squared value @xmath223 has been taken to be @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the total cross section given by the fit , @xmath226 is the experimentally measured total cross section and @xmath227 is the error in the experimental total cross section .",

    "the fit ( [ fit4 ] ) is the simplest of all : it can be obtained from ( [ fit1])-([fit3 ] ) by setting @xmath234 or @xmath235 or both .",

    "one can compare a pair of models which are nested by taking one of them to be the null hypothesis ( the model with fewer parameters ) and the other one as the alternative hypothesis ( the model with more parameters ) .",
    "it is obvious that the alternative hypothesis will almost always have a smaller @xmath237 , due to the bigger parameter space available . in order to determine if such an improvement in @xmath237 is significant , the @xmath13 test needs to be used ( for a review of the @xmath13 test , see  @xcite ) .    in a @xmath13 test , the @xmath223 and @xmath238 values of the null and alternative hypotheses",

    "indeed , in the energy range where data are available , this term behaves almost as a constant and is subleading to the @xmath182 term for the values of @xmath252 found in @xmath247 ( see table [ paramtable ] ) .",
    "more and better data from air shower experiments may be the only possibility of ever addressing the issue from the point of view of achieving any further discrimination .",
    "the high energy behaviour of the total hadronic cross sections was first analysed in  @xcite , where the bound on the rise of the cross section was shown to arise from the finite range of the interaction . in the case of qcd",
    ", this short range arises from the properties of the theory in the infrared .",
    "this indicates that it is the behaviour of the theory of strong interactions in the ir that decides the high energy behaviour of the cross section .",
    "arguments from analyticity and unitarity lead to the froissart ( upper ) bound on such total cross sections . in a bloch - nordsiek",
    "improved eikonalised mini jet model  @xcite , the froissart bound seems to be directly related to the behaviour of qcd in the far ir .",
    "phenomenological fits usually include a subleading logarithmic term as well .",
    "a logarithmic subleading term is often used to fit data , but lacks a theoretical explanation .",
    "it is just a phenomenological observation .    ideally , one would like to understand such a subleading term in the context of qcd .",
    "the understanding of the behaviour of total hadronic cross sections lies in the realm of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "although there has been a lot of interest in the subject and many efforts have been made , the tools required for handling non - perturbative qcd are still being developed .",
    "however , using the ads / cft correspondence , one can map a problem in a strongly coupled gauge theory to a problem in a weakly coupled gravity theory .",
    "hence , we have mapped the high energy behaviour of the total hadronic cross section to a gravity toy model and investigated what the correction terms to the froissart bound are in this simplified scenario .",
    "we have shown that the extension of the holographic arguments in  @xcite generates a subleading @xmath182 term to the froissart bound in the dual field theory .",
    "the duality predicts that the coefficient of such a subleading term is negative if the finite coupling corrections are small . in other words ,",
    "the prediction from an einstein dual together with a perturbative @xmath253 correction through higher curvature corrections is that the coefficient of @xmath171 is negative .",
    "therefore ( since it reduces the upper bound ) , it is an improvement to the froissart bound .",
    "further , we have used all available data to demonstrate that such a @xmath0 term indeed significantly improves the fits .",
    "also , the prediction about the negative coefficient for the subleading term is confirmed from the fits .",
    "presumably , the @xmath0 term reflects the nature of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "while one of course can not claim that the holographic theory is modelling qcd , it is quite remarkable that the general structure arising from holography for the subleading terms in the froissart bound as well as the sign of the first subleading term agree so well with data .",
    "hence , it is possible that the gravity toy model here considered captures certain important aspects of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "while the argument from ads / cft leading to the negative coefficient for the @xmath0 term seems reasonable , another prediction from our ads / cft analysis is that the relative coefficient between the @xmath204 term and the @xmath12 term is -1/4",
    ". it would be interesting if this was borne out by the data , but it seems unlikely to happen in the near future .",
