    "capacity characterization of multi - source networks is one of the fundamental problems in network information theory .",
    "however the capacity is not fully characterized even for the simplest setting of the two - user interference channel @xcite that leads to surging interests and demands on approximate capacity characterization .",
    "recently there has been a series of significant progress on approximate capacity characterization @xcite .",
    "the capacity region of the two - user gaussian interference channel was characterized by etkin , tse , and wang within one bit precision @xcite and the sum capacity @xmath5 of the @xmath0-user time - varying gaussian interference channel was characterized as @xmath6 by cadambe and jafar @xcite , where @xmath7 denotes the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "that is , the degrees of freedom ( dof ) or capacity pre - log term of the @xmath0-user interference channel is given by @xmath8 . to achieve @xmath8 dof ,",
    "a new interference management technique called the interference alignment was used , which minimizes the dimensions occupied by interference at destinations by aligning the interference from multiple unintended sources .",
    "the interference alignment can also be used to compute achievable dof of some other channels such as the @xmath0-user multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channel @xcite , the deterministic @xmath0-user interference channel @xcite , and the @xmath9-network @xcite in which each of @xmath10 sources has messages for @xmath11 destinations , i.e. , total of @xmath12 message sets .    in this paper , we consider relay networks consisting of multiple sources , multiple corresponding destinations , and multiple relays .",
    "relays have been traditionally used for extending coverage in wireless environments , e.g. , amplify - and - forward ( af ) based relays .",
    "although the dof is upper bounded by @xmath13 for fully connected @xmath0-user interference channels  @xcite , with help of relays it may be possible to improve the dof also .",
    "the work @xcite has applied their @xmath9 network results to a two - hop network with @xmath10 sources @xmath11 destinations with @xmath2 relays between them . assuming @xmath14 , they showed that @xmath15 dof is achievable .",
    "notice that whereas a trivial upper bound assuming perfect cooperation between relays is @xmath0 if @xmath16 , the achievable dof of @xmath15 converges to @xmath0 only if @xmath17 .",
    "hence one of the basic questions about relay networks is the minimum number of required relays for achieving the optimal @xmath0 dof .",
    "the works @xcite have addressed similar questions and shown that with @xmath0 fixed the sum rate of @xmath18 is achievable if @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are the follows .    * for @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath0 networks ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath3-hop network with @xmath2 relays , we show that @xmath19 dof is achievable .",
    "hence the optimal @xmath0 dof is achievable if @xmath20 . to show the achievability , interference alignment combined with distributed interference cancellation using multiple relays",
    "is used over multiple symbols ( symbol extension ) to utilize more diversity provided by time - varying channels . a similar interference cancellation technique",
    "called interference neutralization was used for deterministic and non - fading gaussian @xmath3-user @xmath3-hop networks  @xcite , where multiple relays are cooperatively used to cancel interference . in our case , such distributed interference cancellation is combined with symbol extension in a more general network . * for @xmath0-hop networks with @xmath0 relays in each layer ,",
    "we show that the optimal @xmath0 dof is achievable if @xmath0 is even and the probability of channel matrix is a function of its frobenius norm only .",
    "we apply a new technique called opportunistic interference cancellation where the relays in each layer delay - amplify - and - forward their received signal vector by waiting for an appropriate channel instance in the next hop such that the overall channel matrix from the sources to destinations become a scaled identity matrix .",
    "hence @xmath0 source  destination ( s  d ) pairs can communicate concurrently without interference .",
    "this is related to the opportunistic interference cancellation for finite - field networks  @xcite , but our scheme for gaussian relay networks in this paper works differently . for both cases , opportunistic interference cancellation is applied and the optimal dof of gaussian networks and the optimal sum rate of finite - field networks are achieved in certain cases .",
    "notice that @xmath21 relays are again required to obtain @xmath0 dof .",
    "the concept of opportunistic channel pairing can be found in @xcite for the finite - field interference channel and in @xcite for the gaussian interference channel , which it was called ergodic interference alignment .",
    "for the multi - hop case , opportunistic interference cancellation was applied for finite - field networks in @xcite .",
    "throughout the paper , we use notations @xmath22 and @xmath23 to denote a matrix and a vector , respectively .",
    "the transpose , conjugate transpose , and frobenius norm of @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) are denoted by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) , respectively .",
