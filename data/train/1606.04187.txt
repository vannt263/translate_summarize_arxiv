    "the purpose of this article is to give a new proof of the classification of the simple modules of the @xmath0 superconformal minimal model vertex operator superalgebras @xmath1 in the neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors . the rationality in both sectors is also established .",
    "the proof of this classification makes use of a deep connection between the theory of symmetric functions and free field realisations .",
    "moreover , the method of proof in both sectors is essentially the same .",
    "this method has previously been applied to classify the simple modules of the virasoro minimal models @xcite , the admissible level affine @xmath2{2}}$ ] models @xcite and the triplet algebras @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be integers satisfying @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive integers .",
    "additionally , let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the simple highest - weight modules over the neveu - schwarz and ramond algebras , respectively , whose highest - weight vectors have conformal weight @xmath13 , central charge @xmath14 and even parity .",
    "then , we can state the main result as follows ( referring to [ sec : n=1vosa ] for our conventions concerning modules and the notion of parity reversal ) .",
    "the @xmath0 superconformal minimal model vertex operator superalgebra @xmath1 is rational in both the neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors , that is , both sectors have finitely many simple @xmath15-graded modules and every @xmath15-graded module is semisimple .    1 .   up to isomorphism , the simple @xmath1-modules in the neveu - schwarz sector are given by the @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and their parity reversals .",
    "2 .   up to isomorphism",
    ", the simple @xmath1-modules in the ramond sector are given by the @xmath20 , with , @xmath18 and @xmath21 , and , if @xmath3 is even , the parity reversal of @xmath22 ( the other simple ramond modules being isomorphic to their parity - reversed counterparts ) .",
    "the ( non - rigorous ) classification of the simple modules appearing in the @xmath0 minimal models was , of course , very well known to physicists @xcite and the celebrated coset construction confirmed their results for the unitary minimal models @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , rigorous proofs that included the non - unitary models remained elusive . following wang s explicit identification of zhu s algebra for the virasoro minimal models @xcite , kac and wang conjectured the corresponding result for the @xmath0 minimal models @xcite , but were unable to provide a proof for the non - unitary cases .",
    "subsequently , adamovi @xcite extended the coset proof to the non - unitary cases as a simple consequence of his classification @xcite , obtained with milas , of the simple modules of the admissible level @xmath2{2}}$ ] models .",
    "however , he only determined which @xmath0 modules appeared in the neveu - schwarz sector .",
    "the coset construction also produces the simple modules in the ramond sector , but they were not considered because zhu s algebra can not be used to determine whether one has indeed found them all .",
    "the appropriate generalisation of zhu s algebra appeared shortly thereafter @xcite , but it seems that a complete proof for the ramond classification did not appear until @xcite .",
    "our classification proof applies to both neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors and is not contingent on a coset construction . as noted above , it instead relies on embedding the @xmath0 vertex operator superalgebra into a free field vertex operator superalgebra and using tools from the theory of symmetric polynomials to calculate within the latter .",
    "this connection between symmetric polynomials and free field realisations originated in the work of wakimoto and yamada @xcite and was continued in @xcite , where it was used to derive compact formulae for singular vectors of various vertex operator algebras in terms of their free field realisations .",
    "however , the actual utilisation of these singular vector formulae for classifying irreducible modules appears to be new .",
    "recently , there has been a resurgence of interest in using symmetric polynomials to construct singular vectors , particularly for the @xmath0 superconformal vertex operator superalgebras , thanks to the agt conjectures @xcite .",
    "in particular , there have been two parallel developments that are closely related to the work reported here .",
    "one approach @xcite uses a basis of symmetric polynomials called uglov polynomials @xcite , a specialisation of macdonald polynomials that are similar to jack polynomials , and leads to singular vector formulae involving a single uglov polynomial .",
    "however , this has thus far only been studied in the neveu - schwarz sector .",
    "the other approach @xcite instead works with superspace analogues of jack polynomials , called jack superpolynomials , that directly incorporate anticommuting ( grassmann ) variables .",
    "singular vector formulae have been conjectured in both the neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors @xcite and similar results have recently been rigorously proved @xcite .",
    "however , these formulae involve linear combinations of jack superpolynomials .",
    "our work differs from these approaches in that we are not interested in explicit singular vector formulae themselves .",
    "rather , the point is to instead use implicit formulae for singular vectors to explicitly identify zhu s algebras for the @xmath0 superconformal minimal models and thereby classify the irreducible representations in the neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors .",
    "a simple corollary of this is the rationality of these minimal models .",
    "moreover , we do not employ uglov polynomials nor jack superpolynomials in proving the classification theorem , but instead find that the standard jack symmetric polynomials are sufficient .",
    "this does require some more sophisticated tools .",
    "in particular , our proofs rely on the theory of negative parameter jack polynomials associated to admissible partitions that was introduced by feigin , jimbo , miwa and mukhin @xcite .",
    "this aside , many of the arguments are still significantly more involved than one would expect given the elegance of the arguments for the ( non - super ) virasoro minimal models @xcite . it will be very interesting to determine whether our pure - jack formalism can be generalised to accommodate uglov and/or jack superpolynomials and thereby recover this expected elegance .",
    "we mention that the recent results of @xcite show that the non - trivial singular vector in the vacuum module can be expressed in terms of jack superpolynomials .",
    "however , the calculations that connect this expression to zhu s algebras turn out to be independent of the superspace construction ( the anticommuting variables ) and reduce to those reported here .",
    "this article is organised as follows .",
    "[ sec : n=1 ] begins with a review of the @xmath0 universal vertex operator superalgebras and their simple quotients , the @xmath0 superconformal minimal model vertex operator superalgebras .",
    "this is followed by a description of their standard free field realisations and an outline of the construction of screening operators , essential for the singular vector computations to come .",
    "the section concludes with derivations of explicit formulae for certain correlation functions , particularly those involving free fermions .",
    "most of this material is standard , but is included for completeness as well as to fix notation and conventions .",
    "the main topic of [ sec : jack ] is an important ideal of the ring of symmetric polynomials that is intimately connected to jack polynomials that are labelled by a given negative parameter and the so - called admissible partitions .",
    "this is actually a special case of a much more general picture that was introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "we begin by collecting a few combinatorial results concerning admissible partitions that will be used in the calculations that follow .",
    "the main goal is to express the free fermion correlation functions of the previous section in terms of jack polynomials for certain admissible partitions .",
    "the results are very elegant for the neveu - schwarz correlators , but their ramond analogues are ( perhaps unsurprisingly ) somewhat more complicated .",
    "[ sec : zhu ] then combines these expressions for the fermion correlators with the symmetric polynomial theory detailed in @xcite to identify zhu s algebra and its twisted generalisation for any @xmath0 superconformal minimal model .",
    "these identifications quickly yield the desired classification and rationality of the corresponding vertex operator superalgebras in the neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors , respectively . generalising the point of view of (",
    "b ) , we explain in [ sec : twistedzhu ] that the definition of twisted and untwisted zhu algebras is nothing but an abstraction of the action of zero modes on ground states .",
    "we also emphasise that a field only induces an element of a given zhu algebra if it has a zero mode when acting in the corresponding sector .",
    "it seems that this point of view is rarely made explicit in the literature . in our opinion , this greatly obscures the underlying simplicity and utility of zhu theory .",
    "the actual calculation of the twisted and untwisted zhu algebras for the @xmath0 minimal models first notes that these algebras are quotients of polynomial rings in a single variable .",
    "the goal therefore reduces to computing a single polynomial for each .",
    "these polynomials may , in turn , be determined by studying which highest - weight vectors are annihilated by the zero mode of a single ( carefully chosen ) null field .",
    "our first result is that this null field may be constructed in the free field realisation .",
    "the proof uses the jack polynomial technology developed in [ sec : jack ] .",
    "our second result is that the corresponding polynomials are in fact non - zero .",
    "this follows in the untwisted case from a quite general argument , but the twisted version of this is considerably more involved and is instead proven as a corollary to the identification of the untwisted polynomial .",
    "these results then allow us to attend to our main result , the actual identification of these polynomials ( which also requires the free field realisation and jack technology ) .",
    "the calculations are notable for the fact that the methodology does not appear to allow these polynomials to be computed directly , unlike the cases detailed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to determine sufficiently many zeroes that complete identifications can be made by appealing to an obvious symmetry property . it would be very interesting to determine whether these polynomials may be directly determined by generalising to uglov or jack superpolynomials .",

    "in this section , we recall several well known results concerning the @xmath0 vertex operator superalgebras and their free field realisations .",
    "this also serves to settle notation and conventions for the sections that follow .",
    "the @xmath0 superconformal algebras are a pair of infinite - dimensional complex lie superalgebras parametrised by a label @xmath24 : @xmath25 this defines a vector space direct sum decomposition into an even ( bosonic ) subspace , spanned by the @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and an odd ( fermionic ) subspace , spanned by the @xmath28 .",

    ", we shall require that all superalgebra modules are @xmath15-graded , meaning that they admit a vector space direct sum decomposition into an even and an odd subspace .",
    "this decomposition must be compatible with that of the superalgebra so that the action of an even superalgebra element preserves the even and odd subspaces of the module , while the action of an odd element maps between these two subspaces .",
    "it follows that there is an ambiguity in imposing this structure on a given indecomposable module over the superalgebra , even once the vector space decomposition has been agreed upon , because we may swap the even and odd subspaces with impunity . in general , each indecomposable superalgebra module therefore comes in two flavours , isomorphic as modules but not as @xmath15-graded modules , which only differ in the global choice of parity . given a superalgebra module",
    ", we shall refer to the module obtained by swapping its even and odd subspaces as its _",
    "parity reversal_. of course , it may happen that a module and its parity reversal are isomorphic as @xmath15-graded modules .",
    "recall the standard triangular decomposition of the neveu - schwarz algebra : @xmath34 writing @xmath35 , the neveu - schwarz verma module @xmath36 is induced from the @xmath37-dimensional @xmath38-module @xmath39 characterised by the parity of the generating vector @xmath40 being even and @xmath41 there are , in addition , parity - reversed neveu - schwarz verma modules that are induced from an odd vector .",
    "note that neveu - schwarz verma modules are never isomorphic ( as @xmath15-graded modules ) to their parity - reversed counterparts . by the structure theory of these modules @xcite",
    ", this also holds true for neveu - schwarz highest - weight modules .",
    "the construction of ramond verma modules is slightly different as the decomposition @xmath42 is not a triangular decomposition of the ramond algebra , because @xmath43 is not abelian .",
    "however , we may proceed instead via _ generalised _ verma modules which are induced from an arbitrary simple @xmath43-module .",
    "the following classification follows easily from the fact that @xmath44 ( in the universal enveloping algebra ) .",
    "the finite - dimensional , @xmath15-graded , simple @xmath43-modules are classified by the unique eigenvalues @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath45 and @xmath27 , respectively , and the global parity .    *",

    "<S> the classification proofs concentrate on explicitly identifying zhu s algebra and its twisted analogue . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these identifications do not use an explicit expression for the non - trivial vacuum singular vector . while the latter is known to be expressible in terms of an uglov symmetric polynomial or a linear combination of jack superpolynomials , it turns out that standard jack polynomials ( and functions ) suffice to prove the classification .    </S>",
