    "in contrast , our method of ` irrational decomposition ' requires no such device as the proper faces of the cones we use contain no integral points .",

    "cutting @xmath55 with the hyperplane @xmath57 , we obtain a copy of @xmath58 , cutting with @xmath59 gives a copy of @xmath60 , etc .",
    "hence @xmath61 since @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath63    a nice application of theorem [ stanrec ] is the following reciprocity theorem , which was conjectured ( and partially proved ) by ehrhart @xcite and proved by macdonald @xcite .",

    "we remark that the same technique gives a similarly elementary and subtraction - free proof of brion s theorem  @xcite .",

    "any cone has a triangulation into _ simplicial cones _ which are cones with a minimal number of boundary hyperplanes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the starting point for our proof , which differs from other proofs that use such a decomposition .",
    "the decomposition that we use is , from the view of integer points , non - overlapping , and thus we need only apply elementary ( as in elementary  school ) counting arguments , sidestepping any hint of inclusion - exclusion .",
    "triangulate @xmath1 into simplicial rational cones @xmath66 , all having the same dimension as @xmath1 .",
    "now there exists a vector @xmath67 such that @xmath68 and @xmath69 in fact , @xmath70 may be any vector in the relative interior of some cone @xmath71 for which @xmath72 is short enough such that holds .",
    "this means , in particular , that there are no lattice points on the boundary of @xmath73 , and so implies @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , because of , @xmath75 and @xmath76 the result now follows from reciprocity for simplicial cones , which is lemma [ simpleconereciprocity ] below .    despite our title",

    ", @xmath84 contains no integer points on its boundary , and so we may replace @xmath6 by its closure . note that @xmath90 , so we have the identity @xmath91    in terms of generating functions , implies that @xmath92 whence @xmath93    lemma  [ simpleconereciprocity ] is essentially due to ehrhart .",
    "the new idea here is our ` irrational ' decomposition .",
    "as before , triangulate @xmath94 into simple rational cones @xmath95 , each of whose generators are among the generators @xmath96 of @xmath55 .",
    "( such a triangulation always exists ; see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "again there exists a vector @xmath97 such that @xmath98 and no facet of any cone @xmath99 contains any integral points .",
    "thus every integral point in @xmath100 belongs to exactly one simplicial cone @xmath101 , and we have @xmath102 and this union is _ disjoint_. we obtain the identity of generating functions , @xmath103 but now we recall from the introduction that @xmath104 so it suffices to show that the rational generating functions @xmath105 for the _ simplicial _ cones @xmath101 have nonnegative numerators and denominators of the form @xmath106 .    in this case , the cone @xmath101 has integral generators of the form @xmath107 , for some vertices @xmath108 of the polytope @xmath6 , where @xmath32 is a positive integer such that @xmath33 is integral .",
    "substituting @xmath109 into the concrete form of the rational generating function , gives denominator @xmath106 and numerator the generating function for the integer points in the parallelepiped which is generated by @xmath110 and shifted by @xmath70 , where the coefficient @xmath111 of @xmath112 counts points with first coordinate @xmath113 .",
    "suppose first that @xmath114 .",
    "as in the previous proof , suppose that @xmath95 triangulate @xmath55 into simplicial rational cones , each of whose generators are among the generators @xmath96 of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we may extend this to a triangulation @xmath115 of @xmath116 , where the additional simplicial cones have generators from the given generators @xmath96 of @xmath55 and @xmath117 of @xmath116 .",
    "the generators of each cone @xmath118 and the irrational shift vector @xmath70 together give a parallelepiped with no lattice points on its boundary , and the coefficient of @xmath119 in @xmath8 is the number of integer points with last coordinate @xmath120 in the union of these parallelepipeds for @xmath121 .",
    "the result follows as the coefficient of @xmath119 in @xmath43 is the number of integer points with last coordinate @xmath120 in the parallelepipeds for @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "if however , @xmath124 , then the triangulation @xmath95 of @xmath55 extends to a triangulation @xmath125 of @xmath116 , where now the simplicial cones @xmath118 are @xmath38-faces of the simplicial cones @xmath126 . note that the irrational decomposition @xmath127 , @xmath128 restricts to an irrational decomposition of @xmath55 given by some vector @xmath129 .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath130 there is a unique @xmath131 with @xmath132 such that @xmath133 .",
    "the same is true for the parallelepipeds generated by the vectors @xmath134 along the rays of these cones , and also for their shifts by @xmath135 and @xmath70 .",
    "then the result follows by the same argument as before once we interpret the coefficients of @xmath119 in @xmath8 and @xmath43 as the number of points with second coordinate @xmath120 in the union of these parallelepipeds .                            , _ decompositions of rational convex polytopes _ , ann . discrete math .",
