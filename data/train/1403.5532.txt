    "in this paper we develop a laplace s method to deal with series whose summand is sharply peaked about its maximum .",
    "more precisely , the main object of the paper is the asymptotic evaluation of the series @xmath0 with the particular aim of providing a mathematical foundation to the wkb ( semiclassical ) analysis of epidemiological models .",
    "the series @xmath1 is actually a riemann sum , with respect to a homogeneous partition of the positive semi - axis into subintervals of length @xmath2 , of the integral @xmath3 and the asymptotic behavior of the latter integral can be computed by the ( standard ) laplace s method provided it applies , see e.g. @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "one can expect the series to have the same asymptotic behavior as that of the integral if the partition is fine enough , that is for @xmath4 big , while under a certain threshold the effects of the discretization can not be neglected .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "depending on the local nature of the global minimum of @xmath5 , there is an @xmath6 below which the asymptotics of the series and of the integral do not coincide , and the series is oscillatory and even exponentially small with respect to the integral - a pictorial representation of this phenomenon can be found in figures [ fig : i25 ] and [ fig : iunterzo ] at the end of section [ sec : laplaces ] .",
    "for example , we will show that if @xmath5 has a single global minimum point @xmath7 such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 then ( we refer to theorem [ thm : laplacealpha ] and corollary [ cor : fullasymptotic ] for the precise hypotheses and statement )    * if @xmath10 , @xmath11 * if @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the third jacobi theta - function @xcite * if @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the positive triangular wave of height @xmath18 and period @xmath19 .",
    "the reader may wonder whether such a seemingly natural object like @xmath1 had not already been studied and well - understood in the literature .",
    "contrary to our expectations we found few mathematical works devoted to it , the most recent being @xcite @xcite .",
    "paper @xcite deals with the case @xmath12 ( in our notation ) and its application to _ q - polynomials _ while @xcite is devoted to the study of a class of hypergeometric functions defined by series that fall in the case @xmath20 .",
    "the thorough discussion of the existing literature contained in @xcite shows that the series @xmath1 was never considered in the general and simple form we do here .",
    "contrary to the existing works on the subject , our interest does not stem from the asymptotic theory of special functions , but from a branch of applied mathematics in rapid evolution , the semiclassical limit of continuous time markov process , in particular processes related to epidemiological models such as sis and sirs models @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical limit of continuous time markov process originated from the paper @xcite , where it was noticed that many models of population biology ( or more in general skip - free continuous time markov chains ) can be solved by a method similar to the wkb method for quantum mechanics in the _ semiclassical _ asymptotic regime , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for more recent developments .",
    "the semiclassical regime arises when we consider a population of large size @xmath21 and we assume that either the probability distribution @xmath22 is semiclassical , i.e. @xmath23 for some @xmath24 \\to { \\mathbb { r } } $ ] or the generating function is semiclassical , i.e. @xmath25 for some @xmath26 . if one of the two hypotheses holds then , accordingly , either @xmath27 or @xmath28 evolve according to a pair of pdes of the classical mechanics , a hamilton - jacobi equation and a related transport equation .",
    "for example , in the sis model we consider below , these pairs of equations are either equations ( [ eq : hj],[eq : transport ] ) or equations ( [ eq : genhj],[eq : gentransport ] ) .",
    "both approaches have been used with success and it turns out that the generating function plays the role of the momentum representation in quantum mechanics @xcite,@xcite @xcite .",
    "however , it was not at all clear whether the two semiclassical asymptotic regimes coincide , whether a semiclassical probability distribution implies or not a semiclassical generating function .    we will be able to answer this and other related questions analyzing the generating function by means of the laplace s method we will have developed . in fact , if @xmath29 is real and positive then the generating function is a series of the kind @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath32}$ ] is the characteristic function of the unit interval .",
    "the laplace s method will then allow us to show that if the probability distribution is semiclassical then the generating function is semiclassical too .",
    "it will moreover allow us to compute explicitly @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "for example @xmath33 turns out to be the ( restricted ) legendre - fenchel transform of @xmath35 , namely @xmath36}\\lbrace -s(x ) + x \\ln z \\rbrace$ ] . among the various consequences of these computations -",
    "see section [ section : sis ] below -",
    "the most important is probably the equivalence , under some reasonable assumptions , of the two approaches to the semiclassical limit of sis model .",
    "this situation should be compared with the analogous situation in quantum mechanics : in quantum mechanics the wave functions in the momentum and position representations are related by the fourier transform , and in the semiclassical limit the phases of the two wave functions are one the legendre transform of the other @xcite .",
    "the paper is divided into two main sections . in section [ sec : laplaces ] we develop the laplace s method for the series @xmath1 while section [ section : sis ] is devoted to the application of laplace s method ( in the case @xmath20 ) to the semiclassical limit of the sis model . in section [ section :",

    "we have analyzed the series @xmath1 and shown that its asymptotic behavior can be effectively computed for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "most of the proofs we have given are based on the comparison of the given series with a standard exponential or gaussian series . on the other hand , we showed in the proof of theorem [ thm : laplace1 ] that it is possible to compute the asymptotic behavior of the series by comparing it with the integral @xmath118 .",
    "we did that by means of the euler - mclaurin summation formula .",
    "as a consequence , we obtained two different ways of dealing with the series @xmath1 .",
    "the same methods we use allow to deal with a number of variations of the original problem .",
    "for example , in this work we have chosen to consider only functions @xmath5 such that the global minimum is not - degenerate , that is either @xmath259 or @xmath41 . however , degenerate cases can be easily dealt along the lines of this work .      for what concerns the application to the semiclassical limit of population biology , we stick to the sis model .",
    "as it was already noticed , our results in this respect can be extended with few or no modifications at all to many other models of population biology admitting a semiclassical limit .    in the impossibility of tackling the seemingly endless possible variations of the laplace s method and its applications , we believe we have furnished the interested reader enough instruments to tackle some of the possible generalizations      the first problem is the asymptotic behaviour of the generating function for @xmath29 not real and positive . for any @xmath43 , the generating function can be cast into a series of the kind @xmath30 @xmath425 but if @xmath29 is not positive , @xmath426 is not real . since the leading contributions are the ones close to the global maximum of @xmath427 , that is close to the minimum point @xmath358 of @xmath428 , we are led to approximate @xmath347 by the following gaussian series with an imaginary linear term @xmath429 the latter result stems from the poisson summation formula applied to the series .",
    "if @xmath430 is not real and positive , the latter series is thus exponentially small and even smaller than ( the estimate of ) the error term generated by neglecting contribution outside the maximum of @xmath431 , which is - after the proof of theorem [ thm : laplacealpha]- @xmath432 , for any @xmath433 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that @xmath347 is exponentially small relative to @xmath434 if @xmath435 , but we do not know its precise asymptotic behavior .    the second problem , which is related to the first one in case @xmath43 are analytic , is the steepest - descent method for the series @xmath46",
    "let in fact @xmath43 be analytic ( not real ) functions and suppose @xmath436 can be deformed into a path of steepest descent for @xmath5 .",
    "we can then compute @xmath437 by the method of steepest descent .",
    "however , does @xmath438 if @xmath48 is computed by deforming the integration path ?",
    "unfortunately , the euler - mclaurin formula ( [ eq : eulermclaurin ] ) we use to estimate the difference between the series and the integral , does not allow to consider deformations of the integration contour because the bernoulli functions are * not * analytic .",
    "finally the most relevant open problem concerns the global - in - time semiclassical analysis of epidemiological models .",
    "this issue has been recently addressed in @xcite for some particular cases , but it still lacks a general solution .",
    "the obstacle to a global - in - time semiclassical analysis arises from the solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ eq : hj ] ) .",
    "in fact , for quite general initial data the hamilton - jacobi equation develops a singularity in a finite time after which classical solutions become multi - valued .",
    "therefore after this time the probability distribution can not be described in the form @xmath439 for some smooth solutions @xmath27 of the hamilton - jacobi and transport equation ( [ eq : hj],[eq : transport ] ) . in quantum mechanics",
    "this problem can be overcome @xcite by considering the superposition of the different classical solutions , namely a wave function of the form @xmath440 where @xmath441 are the different values of @xmath35 at @xmath442 and @xmath443 some locally constant phases .",
    "however , the superposition principle does not apply in the case of epidemiological models simply because @xmath444 where @xmath445 .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the underlying differential equations ( the markov chain ) are essentially dissipative .",
