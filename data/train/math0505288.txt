    "here we consider aspects of the question of the distortion of infinitely - related groups as subgroups of finitely - presented groups .",
    "higman @xcite showed that every recursively - presentable group occurs as a subgroup of a finitely - presented group , but it is not clear in general what happens to the geometry of the group since this embedding uses complicated algebraic methods and methods from recursive function theory which may affect the geometry of the group severely .",
    "olshanski @xcite constructs isometric embeddings of recursively presentable groups into finitely presented groups using difficult methods that do not lead to easily constructed examples . in the particular concrete cases here",
    ", we consider concrete embeddings of one of the simplest finitely - generated but not finitely - presentable groups , @xmath0 .",
    "we consider two embeddings of @xmath0 into finitely presented groups .",
    "the first is as a subgroup of thompson s group @xmath1 and the second is as subgroup of baumslag s remarkable finitely presented metabelian group which contains @xmath0 and thus a free abelian subgroup of infinite rank .",
    "the distortion of the metric of @xmath0 is linear in thompson s group @xmath1 but is exponential in baumslag s group .",
    "we construct the wreath product in the standard manner , as special case of a semi - direct product . given two groups @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we form the wreath product @xmath4 by taking the direct product of @xmath5 copies of @xmath2 with copy of @xmath2 indexed by an element of @xmath3 .",
    "the generators of @xmath2 act on the conjugate copies of @xmath2 , while generators of @xmath3 act on the coordinates to determine to which of these conjugate copies of @xmath2 the generators of @xmath2 will be applied .",
    "two of the simplest infinite wreath products are the lamplighter group @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "cleary and taback @xcite analyzed aspects of the metric geometry of those groups and other wreath products .",
    "there are natural normal forms for elements in these groups which lead to geodesic words for elements in these groups with respect to their standard generating sets .    for @xmath0 , we consider the standard presentation :    @xmath7 ,   \\mbox { for } i , j \\in { \\mathbb z}>\\ ] ]    where we denote the conjugate @xmath8 of @xmath9 by @xmath10 as @xmath11 and the commutator @xmath12 by @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "geometrically , we can think about this wreath product as a set of parallel copies of @xmath14 strung together along their respective origins .",
    "we can think of this as a string of counters , arranged from left to right with one counter distinguished as the origin .",
    "as in the lamplighter group , we imagine a cursor which moves along the string of counters and will point to a particular one of these counters as being of current interest .",
    "the generator @xmath9 acts as a generator of @xmath14 in the factor to which the cursor currently points and increases the counter in that factor , and the generator @xmath15 moves the cursor to the right to the next counter .",
    "a typical such word is illustrated in figure [ fig : wreathpic ] .",
    "the starting configuration of these counters , corresponding to the identity element in @xmath0 , is with all of the counters at zero and the cursor resting at the counter designated at the origin .",
    "we consider a word in these generators as a sequence of instructions to move the cursor and change the counter in the current factor .",
    "after application of a long string of the generators , we will be in a state where a finite number of counters are non - zero and the cursor points at a particular counter , called the `` final position '' of the cursor for that word .",
    "we define @xmath16 and note that @xmath17 is a generator of the conjugate copy of @xmath14 indexed by @xmath18 .",
    "these @xmath17 commute and we can put any word in the generators into one of two normal forms , ` right - first ' and ` left - first ' , as described by cleary and taback in @xcite :    @xmath19 or @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the final resting position of the cursor is easily seen to be @xmath24 from either of these normal forms , and we can see that the leftmost non - zero counter is in position @xmath25 and the rightmost non - zero counter is in position @xmath26 .    in the ` right - first ' form , @xmath27 , the cursor moves first to the right from the origin , changing the counters in the appropriate factors as the cursor moves to the right .",
    "then the cursor moves back to the origin not affecting any of the counters until passing the origin .",
    "past the origin , the cursor continues to works leftwards , again changing the counters in the appropriate factors .",
    "finally , the cursor moves to its ending location from the leftmost nonzero counter to the left of the origin .",
    "the ` left - first ' form is similar , but instead of initially moving to the right , the cursor begins by moving toward the left .",
    "at least one of these normal forms will lead to minimal - length representation for @xmath28 , depending upon the final location of the cursor .",
    "if @xmath24 is non - negative , then the left - first normal form will lead to a geodesic representative , and if @xmath24 is non - positive , the right - first normal form will lead to a geodesic representative , as described in @xcite , which gives the following measurement of length :    if a word @xmath29 is in either normal form given above , we measure the word length of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath30 and have @xmath31    the first two terms are the minimum number of applications of @xmath32 needed to put all of the counters into their desired states and the last term is the minimum possible amount of movement required to visit the left- and right - most non - zero counters and then the final position of the cursor , counting the required applications of @xmath33 .    .",
    "the origin in the wreath product direction is indicated by a vertical line , empty circles denote counters which are zero , and the final cursor position is indicated by the arrow .",
    "[ fig : wreathpic],width=336 ]    the word @xmath34 pictured in figure [ fig : wreathpic ] has geodesic representatives in right - first normal form since the final position of the cursor is to the left of the origin .",
    "one such minimal representative is @xmath35 of length 20 .",
    "thompson s group @xmath1 is a remarkable , finitely - generated , finitely - presented group which can be understood via a wide range of perspectives .",
    "cannon , floyd , and parry @xcite give an excellent overview of the properties of @xmath1 .",
    "the standard infinite presentation of @xmath1 is given by :    @xmath36    since @xmath37 and so on , @xmath1 is generated by the first two generators and we can define @xmath38 to express all generators and thus all group elements in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . furthermore , all of these infinitely many relations are consequences of the first two non - trivial relations , so we have the standard finite presentation : @xmath41    thompson s group @xmath1 can be described in terms of rooted tree pair diagrams , and there is a natural method of converting between words in a normal form with respect to the infinite generating set and tree pair diagrams , via the method of leaf exponents , as described in cannon , floyd and parry @xcite .",
    "there is a natural notion of a reduced tree pair diagram described there and there are efficient means to convert between the unique normal form for an element of @xmath1 and the unique reduced tree pair diagram for that word .",
    "we consider a rooted binary tree with @xmath18 leaves as being constructed of @xmath42``carets , '' which are interior nodes of the tree together with the two downward directed edges from that node .",
    "the `` left side '' of a tree consists of nodes and edges which are connected to the root by a path consisting only of left edges , and similarly the `` right side '' of a tree consists of nodes and edges which are connected to the root by a path consisting only of right edges .",
    "a tree pair diagram @xmath43 is made up of a ` positive ' tree @xmath44 and a ` negative ' tree @xmath45 .     with carets and leaves numbered .",
    "[ fig : treepairexample],width=336 ]     and @xmath40 of @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : x0x1],title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] +    the reduced tree pair diagrams for @xmath39 and @xmath40 and a typical word in normal form are pictured in figures [ fig : treepairexample ] and [ fig : x0x1 ] .",
    "to understand the metric properties of @xmath1 , we consider expressing words with respect to the finite generating set .",
    "burillo , cleary and stein @xcite estimated the word length in terms of the number of carets and showed that the number of carets is quasi - isometric to the word length .",
    "fordham @xcite developed a remarkable method using tree pair diagrams to efficiently compute exact word length and find minimal length representatives of words .",
    "we can understand word length of elements represented as tree pair diagrams by understanding the how the generators change the tree pair diagram for @xmath28 to that for @xmath46 for the generators , as described in fordham @xcite and in cleary and taback @xcite .",
    "the right actions of the generators can be described as ` rotations ' which change the tree .    , the image of @xmath9 under @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig : h],width=336 ]    the wreath product @xmath0 is a subgroup of @xmath1 and can be realized in many different ways .",
    "perhaps the simplest is as the subgroup @xmath3 generated by @xmath39 and @xmath48 , pictured in figure [ fig : h ] .",
    "the isomorphism between this subgroup and @xmath0 is given by the homomorphism @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the isomorphism is readily established after we see that @xmath39 conjugates @xmath52 and its powers to elements that commute and that there are no other relations .    to understand the distortion of the subgroup @xmath3 in @xmath1",
    ", we compare the word length of an element @xmath53 with its image in @xmath1 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath3 isomorphic to @xmath0 in @xmath1 generated by @xmath54 and @xmath55 is undistorted .",
    "* proof : * we count the number of carets of the image of a word @xmath28 .",
    "first , we consider the case when @xmath56 and then the cases where @xmath24 is nonzero .    * case @xmath56 : * here , the image of the word as a tree pair diagram has a characteristic form where the root of the positive tree is paired with the root of the negative tree , such as that shown in figure [ fig : typicalm ] . in the general case where both @xmath57 and @xmath58 are positive , we have the following carets :    * a single root caret * @xmath59 right carets * @xmath60 interior carets below the right arm of the tree * @xmath61 left carets * @xmath62 interior carets below the left arm of the tree    this gives a total @xmath63 carets in the image of @xmath28 . by burillo , cleary and stein @xcite ,",
    "the number of carets is quasi - isometric to the word length in @xmath1 with respect to @xmath64 and since the length of @xmath28 in @xmath0 is @xmath65 , we see that these lengths are quasi - isometric .     of a word @xmath66 with @xmath15 exponent sum 0 and all positive exponents for @xmath67.[fig : typicalm],title=\"fig:\",width=528 ] +    the image of a typical word with all @xmath68 and @xmath69 positive",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : typicalm ] , corresponding to a series of rightward rotations at nodes distance one from the sides of the tree .    * case @xmath70 : *    in this case , we start with the same tree pair diagram for the @xmath56 case and apply @xmath39 on the right @xmath24 times . each application of @xmath39 will change the negative tree by moving the root caret to a right caret and the topmost left caret to the root , if there is a left caret .",
    "if there is no left caret , a new caret will need to be added for each such application .",
    "for each application of @xmath39 which requires a new caret , in the negative tree , that new caret will become the root caret and in the positive tree , the new caret will be added as the left child of the leftmost caret .",
    "since there are @xmath61 left carets , if @xmath71 , we do not need to add any carets and the number of carets is @xmath72 as before .",
    "if @xmath73 , we will need to add @xmath74 new carets and will have @xmath75 carets .",
    "again , these quantities give lengths which are comparable to word length in @xmath0 .",
    "* case @xmath76 : *    again , we start with the same tree pair diagram for the @xmath56 case and apply @xmath77 on the right @xmath24 times",
    ". each application of @xmath77 will change the negative tree by moving the root caret to become a left caret and the topmost right caret to the root , if there is a right caret .",
    "if there is no right caret , a new caret will need to be added for each such application .",
    "since there are @xmath26 left carets , if @xmath78 , we have that the number of carets is @xmath72 as before .",
    "if @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 carets .",
    "thus in all cases @xmath47 does not distort distances more than linearly , so the subgroup @xmath3 isomorphic to @xmath0 is undistorted in @xmath1 .    .",
    "we can obtain more precise estimates of the quasi - isometry constants using fordham s method @xcite for computing exact lengths in @xmath1 .",
    "we can keep track of the particular caret pairings and their weights and we find that the caret pairings that occur are easily computed .",
    "caret pairing types are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case where @xmath56 and both @xmath58 and @xmath57 are positive , we note that we have the following caret pairs :    * one caret pair of type @xmath81 from the leftmost carets , contributing no weight . *",
    "@xmath61 caret pairs of type @xmath82 from the left side and root , contributing weight @xmath83 .",
    "* @xmath84 caret pairs of types @xmath85 not of type @xmath86 , contributing weight @xmath87 . *",
    "one caret pair of type @xmath86 from the rightmost carets , contributing no weight .",
    "* for each @xmath88 , there will be a single pairing of type @xmath89 contributing weight 2 and @xmath90 pairings of type @xmath91 , contributing weight @xmath92 .",
    "* for each @xmath93 , there will be a single pairing of type @xmath89 contributing weight 2 and @xmath94 pairings of type @xmath95 , contributing weight @xmath96 .",
    "* similarly , for the interior carets from the left side of the tree , we have for each @xmath69 , there will be a single pairing of type @xmath89 contributing weight 2 and @xmath97 pairings of type @xmath91 or @xmath95 , contributing weight @xmath98",
    ".    these will give a total weight of @xmath99= @xmath100 in the case when @xmath56 , which compares to the corresponding length in @xmath0 of @xmath101 .",
    "again , these give lengths which are comparable to word length in @xmath0 .",
    "after similar analysis for other cases , we have that for a word @xmath28 in @xmath0 , we have : @xmath102",
    "baumslag @xcite introduced the group @xmath103 , [ a^t , a ] , a^s = a a^t>$ ] to show that a finitely presented metabelian group can contain free abelian subgroups of infinite rank .",
    "this group in fact contains @xmath0  all relators of the form @xmath104 $ ] are consequences of these three , so the subgroup @xmath3 generated by @xmath9 and @xmath15 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .              in terms of the notation described above",
