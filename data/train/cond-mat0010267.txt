    "<S> we compare the low frequency ( @xmath0  khz ) anelastic spectra of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 and la@xmath4ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 at @xmath5 0.03 and 0.06 in the temperature region where the freezing into the cluster spin - glass ( csg ) phase occurs and is accompanied by an increase of the acoustic absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the amplitude of the anelastic relaxation on doping is explained in terms of movement of the domain walls ( dw ) in the csg phase between the sr ( ba ) pinning points . </S>",
    "<S> the lbco sample at @xmath6 transforms into the ltt structure below 40  k and the amplitude of the anelastic anomaly is 7 times smaller than expected , indicating pinning of the dw which run parallel to the ltt modulation . </S>",
    "<S> such dw can be identified with the stripes of high hole density , and the present measurements show that they are mobile between the sr ( ba ) pinning points down to few kelvin , but become static in the presence of ltt modulation also far from the condition @xmath7 for commensurability between stripe and lattice periodicities .    </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) are a rich source of studies on different aspects of condensed matter theories , including strong electron - electron interactions and magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> soon after the discovery of htsc , it was pointed out @xcite that la@xmath8cuo@xmath3 was the first experimental realization of a model @xmath9 quantum ( q ) 2-dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg ( h ) antiferromagnet ( af ) . </S>",
    "<S> htsc are obtained from 2dqhafs by injecting holes into the cu - o planes . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of doping in 2dqhafs has been widely studied ( for a review see e.g. ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it has been shown that in la@xmath1m@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , by substituting m = sr@xmath10 or ba@xmath10 for la@xmath11 , the long range af order is rapidly destroyed and @xmath12 decreases from 325@xmath13k to practically 0@xmath13k around @xmath14 . when cooling below 30  k , the holes tend to be localized over the cu - o square plaquette near the sr@xmath10 impurities,@xcite allowing for the freezing of the spin degrees of freedom . for @xmath15 , a freezing of the in - plane spin distortions generated by localized carriers </S>",
    "<S> is observed below @xmath16 , corresponding to the onset of a spin - glass ( sg ) state,@xcite while for @xmath17 the freezing into a cluster spin - glass ( csg ) phase is proposed below@xcite @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the sg state corresponds to local distortions of the spin texture in af background , while in the csg phase there are af nanodomains separated by hole - rich domain walls ( dw ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sg and csg states have been investigated by various experimental techniques , such as nqr,@xcite @xmath19sr,@xcite magnetic susceptibility,@xcite and recently anelastic spectroscopy.@xcite gooding _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite have shown that , starting from a 2d heisenberg hamiltonian and taking into account the role of dopant disorder , at sufficiently low temperature the ground state of the system is a cluster spin - glass . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of doping on the magnetic properties of htsc , which are good representatives of 2dqaf s , have been mainly restricted to the study of la@xmath8cuo@xmath3 doped by sr or zn atoms . only recently @xcite it has been shown that a common magnetic phase diagram as a function of the hole concentration @xmath20 in the cuo@xmath8 sheets can be drawn for la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 and y@xmath21ca@xmath2ba@xmath8cu@xmath22o@xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> closely connected with these phenomena is the formation of charged stripes , which can be identified with the walls separating the hole - poor af domains.@xcite in lsco the ordering of the spins and consequently of the charges into parallel stripes is dynamic and incommensurate with the lattice , with a modulation wave vector shifted from the af wave vector @xmath24 by @xmath25 ( in the tetragonal notation ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a linear relationship between incommensurability @xmath26 and doping is found to hold for @xmath27 , while @xmath26 remains locked at @xmath28 at higher doping.@xcite the magnetic modulation is parallel to the modulation of the cuo@xmath8 plane in the lto structure ( at 45@xmath29 with the cu - o bonds ) for @xmath30 , but becomes parallel to the cu - o bonds across the metal - insulator transition , @xmath31 ( ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> these magnetic neutron diffraction peaks have been recently reported to be elastic,@xcite although they could actually be quasielastic and therefore correspond to fluctuating correlations which are observable only by fast probes like neutrons.@xcite these correlations are considered to be static in samples where the substitution of la with both sr ( @xmath32 ) and nd stabilizes the low - temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) structure , with lattice modulation parallel to the stripes;@xcite at such doping levels the stripe wave vector is also close to the commensurate value @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to obtain further insight in this complex interplay of dynamic magnetic and charge ordering and pinning by the lattice , we extended the acoustic spectroscopy measurements of the csg state in lsco ( ref . ) to la@xmath1ba@xmath34cuo@xmath3 ( lbco ) , which has greater tendency to form a stable ltt phase . </S>",
    "<S> the present study demonstrates that the domain walls of the csg phase ( which can be identified as the hole stripes)become static within the ltt structure of lbco even for doping at which the stripe spacing is not commensurate with the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> two la@xmath1ba@xmath34cuo@xmath3  samples and two la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath35  samples with @xmath36  and @xmath6  were prepared by standard solid state reaction as described in ref .   and cut in bars approximately @xmath37  </S>",
    "<S> mm@xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the complex young s modulus @xmath39 , whose reciprocal is the elastic compliance @xmath40 , was measured as a function of temperature by electrostatically exciting the lowest three odd flexural modes and detecting the vibration amplitude by a frequency modulation technique . </S>",
    "<S> the vibration frequency , @xmath41 , is proportional to @xmath42 , while the elastic energy loss coefficient ( or reciprocal of the mechanical @xmath43 ) is given by@xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 , and was measured by the decay of the free oscillations or the width of the resonance peak . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath47 is related to the spectral density @xmath48 @xmath49 of the macroscopic strain @xmath50 through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath51 @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin dynamics can affect @xmath53 through magnetoelastic coupling,@xcite namely an anisotropic strain with principal axes oriented according to the spin orientation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it has recently been shown@xcite that in lsco the freezing into the csg state is accompanied by a step - like increase of the acoustic absorption and a rise of the elastic modulus ; the data of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 with @xmath36 and 0.06 are shown in figs . 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly is observed around or slightly below @xmath54 , as reported in the literature@xcite ( @xmath55  k and @xmath56  k ) and deduced from the maxima in the @xmath57la nqr relaxation rate measured on the same samples.@xcite the nqr and @xmath19sr experiments measure the spectral density @xmath58 of the spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> if the fluctuations occur with a rate @xmath59 , then @xmath60 $ ] is peaked at the temperature at which @xmath61 and the sharp peaks in the nqr and @xmath19sr relaxation rates indicate the slowing of the spin fluctuations below the measuring angular frequency @xmath62  ( @xmath63 @xmath64  hz in those experiments ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same peak , shifted to lower temperature because of the lower frequency ( @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67  hz ) , could in principle appear also in @xmath53 thanks to the magnetoelastic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> however , the step - like @xmath68 curves  of fig . 1 can not be easily identified with the sharp peaks in the nqr  rate,@xcite and can be attributed to the movement of domain walls separating the antiferromagnetically correlated domains.@xcite in this case , the steep rise of the absorption with lowering temperature is determined by the formation of the clusters with frozen af spin correlations , while the broader shape at lower temperature is due to the wide distribution of the relaxation rates of domain walls with different lengths and mobilities .    to our knowledge , the low - doping and low- temperature region of the magnetic phase diagram of lbco has not been investigated , but the close similarity between the anelastic spectra of lbco and lsco in figs . 1 and 2 </S>",
    "<S> indicate that also in lbco  the spins undergo the same freezing processes at practically the same temperatures as in lsco . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalies in the imaginary ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 )  and real parts ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) of the dynamic elastic response attributed to the appearance of the csg state appear below 7  k for @xmath36 in both samples and below 4  k ( 3  k ) for @xmath6 in lsco ( lbco ) . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity between the spectra at @xmath36 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , where both the absorption and real parts of the dynamic response of lsco and lbco are plotted together ( in all figures the young s modulus @xmath69 is normalized to the extrapolated @xmath70 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data of lsco practically overlap with those of lbco if multiplied by 1.45 , indicating that the rise of the elastic modulus is determined by the same mechanism producing the absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath71 can be ascribed to a greater magnetoelastic coupling in the ba compound , possibly resulting from the slightly different atomic sizes and distances .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to the dependence of the amplitude of the anelastic effect on doping . for lsco , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude is a decreasing function of doping , as shown by the open circles of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , which includes also data from ref . . </S>",
    "<S> we want to show that this trend is in agreement with the proposed mechanism of dissipation ( and consequent dispersion in the real part of the modulus@xcite ) due to the stress - induced change of the sizes of domains with differently oriented axes of staggered magnetization.@xcite since the sr dopants act as pinning points for the dw , their concentration affects not only the density @xmath72 of dw but also their mean length @xmath73 between pinning points . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation strength @xmath74 is expected to be of the form @xmath75 with @xmath76 , similarly to the case of the motion of dislocations pinned by impurities,@xcite or with @xmath77 , as proposed for the susceptibility due to the motion of dw between ferromagnetic domains.@xcite    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 the relaxation strength measured with lsco is compared with @xmath78 calculated assuming that the sr atoms above and below a cuo@xmath8 plane form a square lattice with spacing @xmath79 in units of the lattice constant @xmath80 , and that the dw form a square lattice passing through the sr atoms ; the mean number of free atoms along a dw segment is then @xmath81 , since the two extrema at the sr pinning points are fixed . in this manner </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath82 , which reproduces reasonably well the experimental data of lsco with @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the dw run only parallel to one direction , as expected from parallel stripes , then @xmath84 is halved , but the dependence on @xmath85 remains the same . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the dependence of the relaxation magnitude on doping is in agreement with what expected from the motion of dw pinned by the sr atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of lbco at @xmath6 is different , since the amplitude of the step at @xmath86  k is 4.8 times smaller than for lsco ( both in the absorption and real parts ) , and the onset temperature is also slightly lower ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . considering the difference in magnetoelastic coupling , it turns out that the amplitude of the effect in lbco at @xmath6 is 7 times smaller than expected . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction appears clearly in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , where all the data are normalized at @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the depression of the absorption step in lbco with @xmath6 has to be attributed to the transformation into the ltt structure below @xmath87  k , which is observed in the anelastic spectrum ( figs . 1 and 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lto - ltt transition has been mainly studied on samples with @xmath88,@xcite in view of the strong decrease of @xmath89  around that doping . </S>",
    "<S> to our@xmath13knowledge no data are available for @xmath90 in lbco , but our observation of @xmath87  k at @xmath91 is in agreement with the available data@xcite of @xmath92  k for @xmath93  and @xmath94  k for @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the lto - ltt transition on the acoustic properties of lbco has been identified@xcite in a small sound attenuation peak and lattice stiffening below @xmath96  on lbco samples with @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the stiffening,@xmath98 ,  below @xmath99  is strongly doping dependent , with a maximum of 0.05 around @xmath100,@xcite and already lowered to 0.01 at @xmath101 ; the value of 0.004 which we find at @xmath6  is consistent with this trend . </S>",
    "<S> _  _ therefore , we identify the increase of @xmath102  below @xmath103  k with the onset of the transformation to the ltt structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the anelastic relaxation due to the dw motion in the ltt structure of lbco is 7 times smaller than in the lto one of lsco is a clear indication of pinning of the dw motion within the ltt phase . </S>",
    "<S> the pinning of the dw can be attributed to the ltt lattice modulation , with rows of inequivalent o atoms in the cuo@xmath8 plane ( within or out of the plane ) along the direction of the cu - o bonds , irrespective of commensuration effects . </S>",
    "<S> only the walls parallel or nearly parallel to this modulation should be affected , and therefore from the reduction factor @xmath104 we deduce that about 87% of the dw are parallel to the direction of the cu - o bonds in the ltt phase ( in the assumption of a complete transition to the ltt structure ) , in agreement with the direction of the magnetic modulation observed by neutron scattering for @xmath105.@xcite    the pinning of the dw of the csg phase within the ltt structure is not unexpected , since the pinning of the dynamic charge and spin fluctuations into static stripe modulations is well documented for samples with ba or mixed nd and sr substitution with @xmath106 , with modulation wave vector close to the commensurate value @xmath33 and parallel to the ltt lattice modulation.@xcite in the present case , however , @xmath6 is far from the condition of commensurability between stripes and lattice . </S>",
    "<S> also , we emphasize that the suppression of the acoustic absorption from the dw motion implies that the pinned dw are static over a time scale longer than @xmath107  s , which is a much more stringent condition than that for the observation of elastic / quasielastic neutron diffraction peaks.@xcite    in conclusion , we compared the anelastic spectra of sr- and ba - substituted la cuprate in the temperature region where the freezing into the cluster spin - glass phase is observed , at doping 0.03 and 0.06 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the magnitude of the anelastic anomaly on the concentration of sr has been quantitatively explained in terms of motion of dw which are pinned by the sr substitutional atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the anelastic spectra at @xmath36 , with both lsco and lbco having lto  structure , completely overlap with a scaling factor of 1.45 , attributed to greater magnetoelastic coupling strength with ba substitution . </S>",
    "<S> instead , at @xmath6 lbco transforms into the ltt structure and the acoustic absorption due to the motion of the af domain walls in the csg phase is strongly reduced , indicating nearly complete pinning of the magnetic domain walls within the ltt structure . </S>",
    "<S> the dw between different af spin clusters are identified with stripes of high hole density , and the rows of inequivalent o atoms in the lttstructure would provide a modulated potential which pins the charge stripes parallel to this modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the present measurements show that this clamping effect is strong also in the absence of commensuration between stripe and lattice periodicities .    </S>",
