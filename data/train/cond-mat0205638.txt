    "recent developments of laser trapping and cooling of atomic gases , which realized the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) for alkali atoms @xcite , have opened up new interests for condensed atomic gases with multi - components : multi - component bec @xcite and fermi degenerate ( fd ) gas @xcite , and also bose - fermi mixed gas in trapped potentials @xcite .",
    "one of interesting physics in such systems is the phase structures in the ground states . in general ,",
    "multi - component systems show a variety of phase structures and phase transitions between them .",
    "a typical example is seen in the superfluid @xmath0he ( a system with @xmath1 components of orbital and spin angular momenta ) , where there exist more than two condensed phases resulted from different combinations of condensed components @xcite .    in the condensed system of trapped atomic gases with multi - components ,",
    "several studies have been done about new phases and phase transitions : the bcs states in attractive two - component fermi gas @xcite , a transition to the superfluid states in the crossover region between bcs and bec theories @xcite , phase separations of different components in the bec @xcite , fermi gas @xcite and bose - fermi mixed system @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the trapped fermi - degenerate atomic gas with two - components : @xmath2 ( magnetic quantum number ) states of spin-@xmath3 atoms , or two of the hyperfine states of fermionic atoms with larger total spin ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , we denote these components as spin degrees of freedom ( up and down components , or up and down atoms ) in this paper .",
    "when the interaction between different spin components is weak , the stable ground state of the system has a symmetric state in spin - component distributions at @xmath5 where equal number of up and down atoms make similar fermi - degenerate distributions so that the total spin of the whole system vanishes ( paramagnetic state ) .",
    "however , for sufficiently strong interactions between components , an asymmetric state with unequal numbers of up / down atoms can be stable because it can be energetically favorable to increase the fermi energy of one component rather than the increase of the interaction energy between up - down components .",
    "( the interaction energy between up - up / down - down components can be neglected due to the pauli blocking effects . )",
    "we call it `` collective ferromagnetic state '' of two - component fermi gas .    as the terms `` paramagnetic '' and `` ferromagnetic '' suggest , this theory is related with a mechanism of the metallic magnetism , originally proposed by bloch and developed by stoner et.al .",
    "@xcite , where fermi particles are the electrons in conductive bands .",
    "it should be noted that , in the theory of metallic magnetism , a role of @xmath6 is done by the hartree - fock exchange energy .",
    "studies of `` collective ferromagnetic states '' of atom gas are also interesting as experimental testing grounds of theoretical ideas in magnetism .",
    "recently , such ferromagnetism aroused new interests in neutron - star physics as a mechanism of the magnetar ( neutron stars with strong magnetic fields ) @xcite .    in the uniform system",
    ", such ferromagnetic states have been discussed for the atom gas of @xmath7li in relation with the stability of the bcs states  @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic states have also been discussed on the trapped bec where the interactions between different spin components are the origin of the asymmetry @xcite . in this paper , we treat the ferromagnetic states in the trapped and finite fermion system .    in the next section of this paper ,",
    "we formulate a set of equations for the two - component fermi gas at @xmath5 and the stability condition of its solutions in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximations . in section [ sec : solution ] , solutions of the tf - equations are analyzed algebraically , and a critical condition for the collective ferromagnetic states is obtained . in section [ sec :",

    "also the validity of the approximation can be estimated from the smoothness of the mean - field potential : @xmath22 . as a parameter that represent its smoothness",

    "accordingly , in @xmath75 , we should say that the system has no stable solutions in `` equilibrium '' .",

    "[ fig : energy](a ) ( dot - dashed line ) , the amounts of which are almost @xmath120 of @xmath110",
    ".    however , to evaluate the scale of the energy difference , we should compare it with an one - particle excitation energy at the fermi surface , which can be estimated from the scaled chemical potential @xmath41 defined in ( [ eqea ] ) . in case of @xmath30k with the harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath121 ( for other parameters ,",

    "when @xmath123 ( @xmath124 from fig .",
    "[ fig : chemi ] ) , the ratio @xmath125 becomes @xmath126 .",
    "thus , we should say that the energy difference between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states are fairly large .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetry ] , we show the fermion number asymmetry @xmath127 against the total fermion number @xmath37 .",
    "we discussed the possibility of transition to ferromagnetic states in the two - component fermi gas using the thomas - fermi approximation from theoretical points of view . based on the results that we obtained ,",
    "let s discuss experimental conditions and also difficulties to observe ferromagnetic ground states in the trapped atomic gas .",
    "we hope that these difficulties are overcome in future developments in experimental technics .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the ferromagnetic ground states become stable when @xmath128 ; using eq .",
    "( [ eqe ] ) , the unscaled critical number @xmath129 becomes @xmath130 as an example , we take the @xmath30k atoms ( mass @xmath131 ) trapped in the harmonic oscillator potential with @xmath121 . for the scattering length , we take the value @xmath132 ( @xmath133 : bohr radius ) given in @xcite . using these parameters ,",
    "we obtain @xmath134 . in recent experiments ,",
    "the trapped fermi - degenerate gas has been performed up to @xmath135 atoms , so that the larger trapping potential are necessary for realization of the ferromagnetic ground state than currently used one . in addition , because of the high central density ( @xmath136 ) for @xmath137 atoms , the inelastic / multi - body scattering processes in them becomes important , which might destroy the trapped atoms before they reach the required density",
    ".    there can be several possibilities for the reduction of @xmath129 .",
    "for example , if the scattering length can be increased by the feshbach resonance for @xmath30k , which has been observed experimentally @xcite , the value of @xmath129 decreases and the ferromagnetic ground states can be obtained in small fermion number : simple estimation gives , @xmath138 for @xmath139 and @xmath140 for @xmath141 . however , in current experiments , the tuning into feshbach resonances is done by applying the magnetic field , which should make the energy difference between the up and down states and makes the ferromagnetic transition into a crossover in the spin asymmetry .",
    "the ways to tune feshbach resonances by non - magnetic external forces ( e.g. electric fields ) are preferred for the present purpose .        1 .",
    "the experiment starts with the magnetic field in some direction which makes the spin asymmetry ( e.g. @xmath142 ) .",
    "then , the magnetic field is switched off adiabatically in the cooling process . when the number of the remaining atoms is enough large , it shows the ferromagnetic states .",
    "the experiment starts with the symmetric trap ( @xmath143 ) , and , after some relaxation time elapses , the atoms release their spin angular momenta and become the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the case a ) is similar with a standard processe for observing the phase transition in the ferromagnetic materials . in case",
    "b ) , the spin relaxation time is considered to be the same order with that of clusterization , so that it might be difficult to observe the ferromagnetic transition within the lifetime of the atomic gas .    finally , we comment on the spacially phase - separated states in the trapped fermionic gas in the case of the large particle number and interaction strength  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to the phase separation in the uniform system ( two - phase coexistent region ) , discussed in @xcite .",
    "the naive tf calculations give smaller energy for the ferromagnetic states , but the energy difference is very small . the competition / coexistence of these states should be an interesting problem in future .      99 for review ,",
