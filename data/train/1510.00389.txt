    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) is well established from observations of galaxies and galactic clusters , and the cosmic microwave background , although its identity remains elusive . in the context of particle physics , dm is often interpreted as weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with cross sections and masses not far from the electroweak scale .",
    "the number density of dm particles is fixed at thermal decoupling in the canonical freeze - out scenario at high redshift .",
    "the leftover dm species permeate our universe , inducing potential signatures in deep underground experiments , colliders and astronomical telescopes / satellites .",
    "+ dm particles do not have to be absolutely stable but simply long - lived , as happens in many well motivated theories ( for an excellent review , we refer to @xcite ) . in general the longevity of particles is attributed to the conservation of quantum numbers .",
    "for instance , in the case of standard model particles the non - observation of proton decay @xmath5 , electron decay @xmath6 , and neutrino decay @xmath7 are attributed to the conservation of baryon number , electric charge and angular momentum , respectively . in the case of dm particles",
    ", there is no such correspondence based on fundamental symmetries .",
    "therefore dm particles can well be stable on cosmological distance scales , with lifetimes much longer than the age of the universe ( 13.8 gyr @xmath8sec ) ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "such a general requirement should be quantified with no prejudice to current observations , as it has been in the context of extragalactic background radiation ( egrb ) @xcite , galaxy clusters @xcite , anti - proton @xcite and x - ray data @xcite , the cosmic microwave background @xcite and optimized targets using _",
    "fermi_-lat data @xcite .",
    "these datasets have also been used for dm annihilations .    in this paper , we set constraining limits on the dm lifetime using _",
    "fermi_-lat gamma - ray data from the observation of dsphs .",
    "dsphs that are proximate to the milky way are special targets for indirect detection of dm signals for several reasons : ( i ) their gravitational dynamics indicate that they are dm - dominated objects ; ( ii ) they are generally located at moderate or high galactic latitudes and therefore are subject to low diffuse gamma - ray foregrounds ; ( iii ) their lack of unambiguously discernible astrophysical gamma - ray emission ; ( iv ) they possess relatively small uncertainties on the dm profile .",
    "thus , it is fruitful to derive bounds on dm properties using dsphs observations .",
    "a first offering of dsphs constraints on dm lifetimes was made in @xcite using around one year of _",
    "fermi_-lat observations .",
    "yet greater emphasis in the literature has been on constraining dm annihilation cross sections . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors focused on how to distinguish a signal coming from dm annihilation and/or decay using dsphs observations from gamma - ray experiments , whereas in @xcite a multi - wavelength approach was performed for annihilating dm , and in @xcite the impact of hosting intermediate massive black holes was investigated .",
    "various aspects of dm annihilation in these contexts were explored in @xcite .",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration has invested extensive effort in increasing the sensitivity to potential dm signals @xcite , including updates to their point source catalog , and upgrades to the event reconstruction and foreground / background subtraction afforded by the new pass 8 analysis tool .",
    "these have resulted in stringent bounds on the annihilation cross section @xcite . + for dark matter decay , here we extend and complement previous works by including six years of lat data and also employing the new pass8 event class . moreover , for the first time in the literature for decay studies , we stack a larger pool of 15 dsphs using a bin - by - bin maximum likelihood method , treating the astrophyiscal @xmath9-factor of the dsphs as nuisance parameters .",
    "this protocol renders our conclusions robust , and less sensitive to systematics and statistical uncertainties .",
    "the baseline conclusion is that herein we raise the decay liftetime lower bounds of @xcite by factors of around 3 - 10 .",
    "+ for our focus on dark matter decays , the gamma - ray flux ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : flux ] ] ) from any dm congregation is linearly proportional to the j - factor @xmath10 ( see eq .  [ [ eq : jfac_def ] ] ) for the volume - integrated dm content of a galaxy .",
    "the j - factors for dsphs are fairly accurately estimated : recent measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion and half - light radius have led to better determinations of these j - factors @xcite , and such improvements are exploited here to define more accurate bounds on dm properties .",
    "+    we combine these updated @xmath10 values with extensive datasets from six years of observations of dsphs using _ fermi_-lat .",
    "several dsphs observed by _",
    "fermi_-lat do not have their j - factor estimated and are removed from our analysis . for a similar reason we are not including the new dsphs observed by dark energy survey and panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system @xcite .",
    "+    we gather six years of _ fermi_-lat gamma - ray data belonging to the @xmath11 instrument response function , dating since august 4 , 2008 , for the 19 dsphs shown in the main portion of table i. the energy bins range from @xmath12  mev to @xmath12  gev .",
    "we use the pass-8 event class which contains an improved point - spread function ( psf ) and increased telescope effective area compared to previous _ fermi_-lat analysis protocols .",
    "we also employ data from the new point source _ fermi - lat _ catalog , 3fgl .",
    "the lower energy bound is chosen to avoid systematics due to the leakage of photons coming from the earth limb due to poor / broad psf at energies lower than 500 mev . + as aforementioned , we show the 19 dsphs of interest plus reticulum ii with their respective positions , distances and j - factors in table i. within @xmath13 , the dm profile of all dsphs are well described by a nfw profile ( see table iv of @xcite ) .",
    "we singled out these 19 dsphs because several dsphs , namely bootes ii , bootes iii , canis major , pisces ii , and sagittarius , have j - factors that are either poorly constrained , or are not determined at all .",
    "they are thus excluded from our study . moreover , in our stacked analysis , canes venatici i and leo i were left out because their regions of interest ( rois ) in the sky overlap with canes venatici ii and segue 1 that have larger j - factors",
    ". furthermore the roi of ursa major i overlaps with that of wilman 1 , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , wilman 1 is omitted here since @xcite did not report its j - factor .",
    "those choices concur with those from fermi - lat collaboration in @xcite .",
    "hence , to avoid statistical interference and follow the procedure in @xcite , we use 15 dsphs , namely bootes i , canes venatici ii , carina , coma berenices , draco , fornax , hercules , leo ii , leo iv , sculptor , segue 1 , sextans , ursa major i , ursa major ii , and ursa minor in the stacked analysis . + as usual , we reject events with rocking angle larger than @xmath14 to minimize contamination from the bright limb of the earth as well as events during periods when the rocking angle of the lat instrument was larger than @xmath15 using the _ gtmktime _ tool of _ fermi_-lat software . after defining the roi as in @xcite with @xmath16 pixels and 24 energy bins logarithmically separated using _ gtltcube _ and _ gtexpcube2 _ tools , we model the diffuse and isotropic background emission using the galactic and extragalactic models provided in @xcite .",
    "+ we perform a bin - by - bin likelihood analysis of the gamma - ray emission within @xmath17 of each dsph galaxy s center , which set the normalizations of the diffuse sources and the normalizations of point - like background sources within @xmath17 of each dsph center as in @xcite .",
    "for each dsph , the spatial dm distribution is modeled by a nfw dark matter profile with a j - factor ( @xmath10 ) defined as @xmath18 where the dm density @xmath19 is integrated along lines of sight elements @xmath20 for different directions within the roi solid angle @xmath21 .",
    "values for @xmath10 for our dsphs sample are listed in table i , taken from @xcite ; these are proportional to the expected intensity of @xmath22-ray emission from dm decay in a given roi assuming a spherically symmetric nfw dm density distribution , @xmath23where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the characteristic density and scale radius , which are determined dynamically from the maximum circular velocity @xmath26 and the enclosed mass contained up to the radius of maximum @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "+ we emphasize that within @xmath27 the integrated j - factor is rather insensitive to the choice of the dm density profile for slopes not steeper than 1.2 @xcite .",
    "the integrated j - factors of our selected dsphs were obtained over a cone of radius @xmath28 , i.e. , accounting for @xmath29 of the total dm emission , which is a conservative approach .",
    "if we had instead used the larger value @xmath30 from @xcite , our limits would be raised by a factor of two or so .",
    "we then compute the likelihood of an individual target i , + @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the parameters of the dm model , i.e. the product of the dark matter lifetime and mass as we shall see further , @xmath33 is the set of nuisance parameters that includes both nuisance parameters from the lat analysis ( @xmath34 ) and the dsph j - factor @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the gamma - ray data .",
    "notice that we incorporated a likelihood j - factor term as an attempt to account for statistical uncertainties on j - factors of each dsphs which is defined as , + @xmath37 where @xmath35 is the true value of the j - factor of a dsphs @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the measured j - factor with error @xmath40 .",
    "we later join the likelihood functions , @xmath41    notice that this procedure , which matches the one adopted in @xcite , is independent of the dm energy spectrum in each energy bin , since it corresponds to an upper limit on the energy flux .",
    "we now evaluate the test statistic ( ts ) defined as @xmath42 , and require a change in the profile log - likelihood of @xmath43 from its maximum corresponding to 95% c.l .",

    "the characteristic mass dependence of the limit curves for each individual dsph can be explained by comparing the shape of the upper flux limit curve and the energy spectrum of the final decay state , in this case @xmath52 .",

    "plus , the upper limit on the flux of each individual dsph differs , which results in different limits on the dark matter lifetime .",
    "in other words , for a given final state , the shape of the limit curve differs from galaxy to galaxy , as can be seen in fig.1 .",
    "therefore , stacking a large sample of dsphs makes our combined limit less sensitive to a peculiar dwarf galaxy , i.e. more broadly representative .",
    "the use of an individual dsph to place constraints on dm properties might bias bounds , since the dark matter distribution of each of the dsphs does not have to be precisely the same .",
    "plus , the upper limit on the flux of each individual dsph differs , which results in different limits on the dark matter lifetime . in other words , for a given final state , the shape of the limit curve differs from galaxy to galaxy , as can be seen in fig.1 .",
    "therefore , stacking a large sample of dsphs makes our combined limit less sensitive to a peculiar dwarf galaxy , yet more broadly representative . for these reasons we performed a maximum likelihood analysis of a stack of 15 dsphs treating the j - factors as nuisance parameters , as described in the previous section , and obtained stringent constraints on the dm lifetime shown in fig.2 for the decay modes : @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath68 includes decays into all light quarks .",
    "these decay channels encompass both fermionic and bosonic dm , making our bounds applicable to a plethora of dm models . + as expected , after properly stacking the bin - by - bin likelihood functions of each dsphs , our combined limit gets stronger and less sensitive to systematic and statistical uncertainties .",
    "we conclusively exclude decay lifetimes up to @xmath69  sec into @xmath52 and @xmath70  sec into @xmath53 .",
    "most of the final states have a kinematic cut - off prohibiting existence of limits for certain masses . for sufficiently small dm masses",
    "most of the photons appear outside the energy window of interest ( i.e. below 500 mev ) , thereby defining the sharp drop for channels such as @xmath71 and @xmath51 .",
    "+ for instance , for fermionic dm , such as the gravitino in supersymmetry @xcite , decays into @xmath57 , @xmath56 , @xmath72 are limited to lifetimes larger than @xmath73  sec . in the context of supersymmetric grand unification ,",
    "six dimension mass operators may lead to dm decay with a lifetime @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "for decay into bb , we bound the scale of unification ( @xmath75 ) to be larger than @xmath76 for a @xmath65  gev ( @xmath1  tev ) dm particle .",
    "+    these findings demonstrate that stacked studies of dsphs provide robust and restrictive lower limits for the dm lifetime . to provide context for our study",

    "our bounds improve upon previous results for dark matter masses below 30 gev or so , whereas for decays into @xmath3 , our constraints are the most restrictive for masses below @xmath77   gev .",
    "one should keep in mind that @xcite used older data and fermi - lat software , therefore an improvement on their limit is expected when updating the data / analysis specially for the bb final state , though it is beyond the scope of our manuscript to compute it . here , we simply quote their results .",
    "we stress that antiproton ( positron fraction ) data may provide stronger limits @xcite on dm decaying into @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , but since these are subject to rather large uncertainties we left them out , and focused our comparison among gamma - ray searches .",
    "moreover , we neglected existing limits from planck data @xcite , super - k and icecube @xcite on @xmath3 since they are much weaker .",
    "+ we point out that recently a @xmath22-ray excess has been claimed for a newly discovered dwarf galaxy reticulum ii @xcite .",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration has independently performed a similar analysis that indicates that the excess above @xmath78 mev is merely a statistical fluctuation of the background , since no surplus of photons is observed in the remaining dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the origin of this @xmath22-ray emission is unclear , especially because the two groups used different datasets , and their conclusion concerning the chance of a background fluctuation mimicking the potential dark matter signal differs . for these reasons",
    "we have omitted reticulum ii from the stacked analysis , but as a contextual note we obtained the limits on the dark matter lifetime , exhibited in fig.[limitsreti ] , stemming from reticulum ii using the upper flux reported in @xcite with the j - factor presented in the table i.    it is clear that there is anomalous behavior for @xmath52 , which provides a very good fit to the excess seen in @xcite for dm masses around dozens of gev .",
    "the limit arising from reticulum - ii is still weaker than our combined one .",
    "similar to the other dsphs , the shapes of the limit curves result from a combination of the shape of the energy spectrum of the final state , and the upper flux reported in @xcite .",
    "+    in this paper , we have used 500mev-500gev gamma - ray data from the _ fermi_-lat observation of milky way satellite dsphs to place stringent and robust lower bounds to the dm lifetime .",
    "we derived individual and stacked limits for several channels for the first time in the literature .",
    "we further compared our results with others from different search strategies , conclude that among gamma - ray searches dsphs are the leading ones for dark matter masses below @xmath79  gev and @xmath80  gev for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 final states , respectively .",
