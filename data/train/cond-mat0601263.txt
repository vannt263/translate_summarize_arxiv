    "traditional experiments on biological molecules are carried out on large groups of molecules .",
    "such groups of molecules are macroscopic thermodynamic systems which can be interpreted using conventional thermodynamics .",
    "recently , it became possible to experimentally manipulate individual molecules .",
    "such single molecules are investigated for several reasons , some of which are mentioned below .",
    "the mechanical properties of single molecules are important in processes like polymer folding @xcite and dna strand separation @xcite .",
    "biophysicists study small motors that are responsible for converting chemical energy to useful forms of work .",
    "these biological machines work under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the working principles are poorly understood .",
    "many biomolecules can function as such motors .",
    "so the study of single molecules can help to understand the properties of biological machines @xcite .",
    "the experiments @xcite of interest for the present paper combine results obtained under varying thermodynamic circumstances . in one type of experiment ,",
    "the two ends of a single linear molecule are held at fixed positions and the exerted forces are measured . in the other type of experiment , the force exerted on the ends is constant and the position of the end points is measured .",
    "the corresponding ensembles differ because in one case the end positions are fluctuating quantities while they are kept constant in the other case .",
    "nevertheless , the outcomes of the two experiments should be related , as argued in @xcite . in general , results of statistical physics",
    "do not depend on the choice of ensemble .",
    "this equivalence of ensembles has been proven for large classes of systems .",
    "however , it may fail in case of single molecule experiments for at least two reasons .",
    "the proof of ensemble equivalence relies on the thermodynamic limit , while here the number of degrees of freedom is limited .",
    "it may also break down because long range interactions , in particular those due to excluded volume , are important .",
    "the present paper is based on the model studied in @xcite .",
    "this model is simple enough so that statements can be made which do not depend on the assumption of a large number of degrees of freedom .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the ensemble dependence of measurements on single molecules in more detail . in section [ model ]",
    "we give a short review of the results obtained in @xcite and we show how this results can be applied on single molecules . in sections [ isotensial ] and [ isometric ]",
    "we derive expressions for the force - extension relation for two different ensembles , the canonical and the grand canonical ensemble . in section [ compa ]",
    "we compare the force - extension relations of both experiments .",
    "the final section gives a short discussion of the results .",
    "in the next two paragraphs we discuss two types of experiment , first from experimental and then from theoretical point of view .",
    "the first experiment is the ideal isotensional experiment where the forces on the end points of the molecule are kept constant and the fluctuating end - to - end distance is measured .",
    "the second experiment is the ideal isometric experiment where the end points of the molecule are held fixed and the fluctuating force is measured . a clear description of a possible experimental setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "the outcome of both experiments is a force - extension curve . in the isotensional experiment ,",
    "one obtains the average end - to - end distance @xmath0 as a function of the applied force @xmath1 . in the isometric experiment ,",
    "one obtains the average force @xmath2 as a function of the fixed end - to - end distance @xmath3 .",
    "inverting @xmath0 results in @xmath4 .",
    "an interesting question is whether @xmath2 and @xmath4 should coincide .    from a thermodynamic point of view , the end - to - end distance @xmath3 is a ( non - conserved ) observable and the force @xmath1 is the corresponding control parameter ( just like temperature is the control parameter of the energy ) . by measurement of the average value of the observables",
    "one can estimate the value of the corresponding control parameters .",
    "in this view , the canonical ensemble is a one parameter family .",
    "such family has only one fluctuating observable ( mostly the energy ) and one control parameter ( mostly temperature ) .",
    "hence , the isometric experiment is described by a canonical ensemble because only the energy fluctuates .",
    "the isotensional experiment requires a grand canonical ensemble because both the energy and the end - to - end distance fluctuate .",
    "one can derive expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath4 in both ensembles .",
    "whether the expressions are equal or not , boils down to a question of equivalence of a canonical and a grand canonical ensemble .    in @xcite keller",
    "investigate the ensemble dependence of single molecule measurements .",
    "they replace the familiar thermodynamic potentials ( gibbs or helmholtz free energy ) by appropriate potentials of mean force .",
    "keller find that the two experiments should be related by a laplace transform . in the thermodynamic limit ( infinite long chain ) the laplace transform is dominated by it s saddle point value and the two experiments",
    "are then related by a legendre transform @xcite . following this reasoning ,",
    "the force - extension relations of both experiments coincide . however , in general the saddle point approximation is not valid .",
    "therefore the experimentally obtained force - extension relations are distinct .",
    "in @xcite we have studied a non - markovian random walk in one dimension .",
    "it depends on two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the probabilities to go straight on when walking to the right , respectively to the left .",
    "we have calculated the joint probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "this is the probability to end in position @xmath3 with @xmath8 reversals of direction after @xmath9 steps .",
    "the random walk can be used as a simple model of a polymer with @xmath9 atoms .",
    "energy @xmath10 is proportional to the number of kinks @xmath8 and is given by @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the polymer is totally folded at zero temperature .",
    "the position of the end point @xmath3 measures the effect of an external force applied to the end point .    in @xcite",
    "we have calculated an exact expression for @xmath7 .",
    "it is the product of two contributions @xmath12 the function @xmath13 counts the number of walks which start in the origin and end in @xmath3 after @xmath9 steps with @xmath8 kinks .",
    "this function only depends on the final values of @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "the probability that an @xmath9-step walk ends in @xmath3 and has @xmath8 kinks is denoted @xmath14 .",
    "this probability depends on the values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the initial conditions .",
    "see figure [ example : prob ] for an example of a walk with @xmath15 steps and @xmath16 kinks , ending in @xmath17 and starting to the right .",
    "there are two possible configurations @xmath18 .",

    "we will show that the parameter @xmath33 is the inverse temperature and @xmath1 is the applied external force .",
    "the model depends on two parameters , the probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( or the inverse temperature @xmath33 and the applied external force @xmath1 ) .",
    "hence measurement of two observables is needed to estimate the values of all parameters of the model . in @xcite",

    "we proceed with the isometric experiment , which is described in the canonical ensemble , with fixed end - to - end distance @xmath3 . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath54 .",
    "the probability distribution is the conditional distribution obtained from @xmath29 by requiring that @xmath3 has a given value @xmath55 with @xmath56 the canonical partition function .",
    "the entropy is @xmath57 the free energy is @xmath58 the mean force can be obtained by taking the derivative of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is a discrete variable , so the force becomes @xmath59 we can not calculate this discrete derivative in closed form . in the next section",
    "we proceed by assuming that @xmath8 and @xmath3 are continuous variables . under this assumption",
    "an explicit expression for @xmath2 can be obtained . the differences between this expression and expression ( [ fkanex ] )",
    "will be discussed in detail .",
    "see also fig.[fig : fcondis]a .",
    "assuming that @xmath8 and @xmath3 are continuous variables ( @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath3 large ) , one can replace summations by integrations . in [ app1 ]",
    "we derive under this assumption following expression for the force @xmath60 in the continuum approximation , the force consists of two contributions .",
    "the first contribution is due to the change of entropy , the second is a finite size effect ( this term disappears in the limit @xmath61 ) .",
    "expressions ( [ fkanex ] ) and ( [ fkanco ] ) differ in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , the limiting value of expression ( [ fkanex ] ) is @xmath63 the limiting value of expression ( [ fkanco ] ) is @xmath64 .",
    "the force vanishes in the limit @xmath61 because an infinite chain implies that the average number of kinks is infinite , independently of the end - to - end distance .",
    "this has the immediate consequence that for low temperatures the force equals zero .",
    "mathematically , the origin of the difference between the force for a finite or an infinite chain , is the order of taking the limit @xmath61 and performing the derivative with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "this can be seen by taking the limit @xmath61 of expression ( [ dfff ] ) @xmath65 we conclude that the order of taking limits influences the result for the force . to illustrate this we plotted expressions ( [ fkanex ] ) and ( [ fkanco ] ) as functions of @xmath33 ( with @xmath9 and @xmath3 large ) in figure [ fig : fcondis]a .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the continuum approximation holds for small values of @xmath33 , but not for large values of @xmath33 , because of the different limiting values .",
    "if the experiment is carried out fast enough , the entropy is constant and does not contribute to the adiabatic force , which is given by @xmath66 .",
    "the results obtained in this case are found in [ app2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : fcondis]b shows expressions ( [ isoentropic_fdis ] ) and ( [ isoentropic_fcon ] ) as functions of @xmath33 .",
    "again , the continuum approximation holds for small values of @xmath33 , but not for large values of @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ fig : fcondis]b shows also that the discrete force is an increasing function of @xmath33 .",
    "we can understand this by following reasoning .    in the limit @xmath62 , the isometric experiment and the adiabatic experiment",
    "coincide , because in this limit the free energy is equal to the energy .",
    "the average number of kinks equals the maximum that is allowed under the constraint of the fixed end - to - end distance @xmath3 . extending the chain with @xmath67 , results in a decrease of the average number of kinks by @xmath68 .",
    "so the force becomes @xmath69 . for lower values of @xmath33 the average number of kinks decreases .",
    "then an extension of the chain by @xmath67 can still be compensated by a decrease of the number of kinks , but also by a rearrangement of the kinks , without changing their number .",
    "so the decrease of the average number of kinks is smaller than @xmath68 and the force is smaller than @xmath69 .",
    "the difference between the isometric and the adiabatic force can most clearly be seen in the limit @xmath70 .",
    "figures [ fig : fcondis]a and [ fig : fcondis]b demonstrate that the isometric force diverges in the high temperature limit , while the adiabatic force converges to a constant . this limiting behaviour can be calculated in closed form using the original , non - approximated expressions for @xmath71 as defined in @xcite .",
    "the high temperature limit of the number of kinks is @xmath72.\\ ] ] the high temperature limit of the adiabatic force is @xmath73 while the limiting value of the isometric force is @xmath74 stirling s approximation and the continuum approximation have been used to obtain the last expression .",
    "figure [ fig : fgrootkano]a shows the exact force - extension relations for the grand canonical ( [ fbetagroot ] ) and canonical ( [ fkanex ] ) ensembles . as can be seen , they differ . in certain limits",
    "however the two force - extension relations do coincide .",
    "assume that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "then one can approximate the grand canonical force by @xmath77 with @xmath78 defined by @xmath79 figure [ fig : fgrootkano]b shows the quotient @xmath80 . from this figure",
    "it is obvious that the canonical force and @xmath81 are approximately the same for most values of @xmath51 .",
    "the grand canonical force equals @xmath81 up to a term proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "so the force - extension relations of the grand canonical ensemble and the canonical ensemble are equivalent if @xmath82 .",
    "this inequality holds when @xmath75 and @xmath76 .      in the grand canonical ensemble",
    ", one can calculate the average value @xmath0 of the end - to - end distance for any given temperature @xmath45 and external force @xmath1 , using the probability distribution @xmath29 .",
    "in general , this average value does not coincide with the most probable value @xmath83 of the end - to - end distance . in @xcite ,",
    "keller argue that the difference between the two experiments is a consequence of the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath83 .",
    "we will follow the lines of @xcite to prove this statement for our model .",
    "first consider the isotensial experiment . with a fixed force and a given temperature",
    "one can calculate @xmath0 .",
    "after inverting this relation one obtains @xmath4 .",
    "the most probable value of the end - to - end distance can be calculated by solving the equation @xmath84 based on numerical evidence , we assume that this equation has only one solution .    next consider the isometric experiment , with fixed end - to - end distance taken equal to @xmath83 .",
    "using formula ( [ fkanex ] ) one obtains for the average force @xmath85 in the continuum approximation following equation holds @xmath86 this is the same result as that obtained by keller @xcite .",
    "it means that the average force @xmath87 measured in an isometric experiment equals to the fixed force @xmath1 of the isotential experiment provided that the fixed extension of the isometric experiment is @xmath83 instead of the average end - to - end distance of the isotential experiment @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the force - extension relations of the isometric and isotential experiment coincide only when @xmath88 .",
    "this is the case in the limit of large @xmath9 , when fluctuations are negligible .",
    "in this paper we study two polymer stretching experiments . the theoretical description involves two different ensembles , one canonical , the other grand canonical .",
    "we have derived expressions for the force - extension relations in both ensembles using a simple model .",
    "the model is a one - dimensional random walk depending on two parameters .",
    "we showed in @xcite that the probability distribution of the walk is approximately a gibbs distribution , see ( [ probgroot ] ) . in the present paper",
    "we ignore the small deviations from the gibbs distribution .",
    "the model represents a polymer which has @xmath8 kinks and end - to - end distance @xmath3 .",
    "the averages @xmath35 and @xmath36 , or the corresponding control parameters external force @xmath1 and temperature @xmath45 , are used to determine the two model parameters .    in the grand - canonical description",
    "the two observables @xmath8 and @xmath3 both fluctuate .",
    "the external force @xmath1 is modelled as usual by adding a term @xmath89 to the hamiltonian .",
    "the force @xmath4 as function of the average end - to - end distance is obtained by inversion of @xmath35 as a function of @xmath1 . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the end - to - end distance @xmath3 is fixed .",
    "the probability distribution for this experiment is obtained from the grand canonical distribution by conditioning on @xmath3 .",
    "the average force @xmath87 is then obtained as minus the gradient of the free energy ( or of the energy in the adiabatic case ) . in this way one",
    "obtains the average force @xmath2 as function of the fixed end - to - end distance @xmath3 .",
    "a peculiarity is that the result depends slightly on the order of taking the continuum limit and calculating the gradient .",
    "in general the two force - extension relations @xmath4 and @xmath2 are different , which can clearly be seen in figure [ fig : fgrootkano]a . in @xcite ,",
    "keller argue that the difference between the experiments is due to the difference between the average end - to - end distance calculated in the grand canonical ensemble and the most probable end - to - end distance of the grand canonical distribution .",
    "our calculations confirm this point of view .",
    "but we find additional effects due to finiteness of the polymer chain .",
    "all these effects disappear in the limit of infinite long chains , so that the two experiments coincide in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is highly desirable to extend our work to two or three dimensions because the role of entropy is too limited in @xmath90 .",
    "this is the reason why the present model does not exhibit a folding transition .",
    "assume that @xmath3 and @xmath8 are continuous variables",
