    "the subject of this paper is the coulomb sum rule ( csr ) for inelastic electron scattering  @xcite , in a reformulation which extends its validity to relativistic momentum transfers @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the three - momentum transfer to the target nucleus , and @xmath4 is the nucleon mass . the purpose of this work is to provide practical methods for the analysis of the longitudinal @xmath5 response of nuclear targets , at the higher energies now available at the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) and other electron accelerators . in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we derived a relativistic coulomb sum rule ( rcsr ) which incorporates the relativistic effects of nucleon recoil at large @xmath1 , as well as of fermi motion . in the present work we extend this theoretical approach to include the effects of nuclear interactions on the rcsr .    in our recent article",
    ", we discussed in detail the assumptions under which a rcsr could be derived .",
    "the basic approximation is that only nucleon , i.e. , as opposed to antinucleon , degrees of freedom enter the coulomb response in the spacelike regime accessible by @xmath5 experiments .",
    "we call this the `` nucleons - only '' approximation ; it ignores effects of antinucleons , but includes fully the relativity of the nucleons . following conventional treatments",
    ", we adopt an impulse approximation which ignores explicit contributions from the exchange of charged mesons .",
    "we include nucleon anomalous moments and elastic form factors , which are important at higher energies .",
    "the final assumption is less conventional , but absolutely necessary . in order to derive a _",
    "non - energy - weighted _ sum rule , it must be possible to factor _ all _ dependence on the photon energy @xmath6 from the current matrix element , otherwise dynamical effects enter into the coulomb response function and complicate the isolation of correlation effects .",
    "in this paper , we restrict our attention to form factor models which have factorable dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "we define the nuclear coulomb sum in terms of the coulomb response function @xmath7 and the proton electric form factor @xmath8 :    @xmath9    where the lower limit @xmath10 excludes the quasielastic peak , and the upper limit @xmath1 restricts the integration to spacelike four - momenta . under the assumptions of ref .",
    "@xcite mentioned above , we obtain a rcsr which can be expressed in terms of one- and two - body contributions :    @xmath11    where the one - body contribution is of the form    @xmath12    @xmath13 includes two - body correlation information in momentum space , and @xmath14 is the uncorrelated two - body part which is related to the square of the nuclear elastic form factor , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the one - body term ( [ ac ] ) , @xmath15 is the nucleon momentum distribution function for isospin projection @xmath16 and one spin projection , and @xmath17 is a kinematic factor which arises due to relativistic nucleon recoil and fermi motion in the target . in the nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath18 ) , we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which leads to @xmath21 ; then the sum rule ( [ ab ] ) is the result of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic effects are all in the functions @xmath17 , representing recoil of the struck nucleon and fermi motion in the target ground state . in ref .",
    "@xcite we further showed that ( [ ac ] ) does not depend strongly on the details of @xmath15 , but only on the lowest momentum moments , e.g. , @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to a method of evaluating ( [ ac ] ) accurately in a weakly model - dependent manner , and in principle permits the extraction of the correlation function @xmath13 from the the experimentally measured coulomb sum ( [ aa ] ) , using ( [ ab ] ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate what changes are required in the sum rule when the coulomb sum @xmath23 is modified by relativistic two - body interactions .",
    "we study the effect of the average interaction in the nucleus using the mean field approach of quantum hadrodynamics , a relativistic field theory for nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider qhd - i , which includes vector and scalar isoscalar mesons only .",
    "we then reformulate the coulomb sum rule of ref .",
    "@xcite so that results ( [ aa])([ac ] ) have a similar structure , but with modifications reflecting the mean - field effects of these relativistic interactions .",
    "these modifications have two main effects on the rcsr : first , there are kinematical effects resulting from mean - field interactions of the nucleons , which are represented in qhd - i by a reduction in the effective nucleon mass @xmath0 in the medium .",
    "consequences of a reduced effective nucleon mass @xmath0 for the coulomb sum have been considered previously in a fermi gas model  @xcite .",
    "these calculations include interactions of both initial and final plane - wave nucleon states with the mean fields , through the effective mass @xmath0 , which can be interpreted as binding in the initial state , and final state interactions of the ejected nucleon with the nucleus .",
    "chinn , picklesimer and van orden  @xcite have studied the effects of final state interactions on the coulomb response of a fermi gas , using more realistic interactions , and have seen similar effects to those seen due to @xmath24 .",
    "second , the electromagnetic coupling of the nucleon in medium may be modified by the mean fields , entering through the off - shell behavior of the nucleon elastic form factors .",
    "both modifications introduce a degree of model - dependence in the rcsr which is not present in the nonrelativistic formulation , nor in the relativistic formulation of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we show how these features can be incorporated into the theory to allow the evaluation of the one - body contribution @xmath25 , and the subsequent extraction of the two - body correlation function @xmath13 from the measured coulomb response .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the basic formalism to include relativistic mean - field effects in the coulomb sum rule ( rcsr ) .",
    "we introduce two models ( f and g ) for the electromagnetic charge operator , and investigate the resulting behavior connected to different off - shell assumptions for the nucleon elastic form factors . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive a modified version of the rcsr ( [ aa])([ac ] ) , concentrating on the explicit changes to the one - body term @xmath25 in off - shell models f and g. in section 4 , we illustrate the operation of the sum rule in a simple nuclear system : uniform nuclear matter treated in the mean - field approximation , with nuclear binding effects incorporated using qhd - i .",
    "we examine the sensitivity of the rcsr to @xmath0 and to the choice of off - shell models ( f and g ) , focussing on the convergence of the moment expansion in each case .",
    "we further demonstrate that the particular form of the rcsr given here is applicable to _ both _ models , and argue that the same form should also be valid for a broad class of form factor models . in section 5 , we draw conclusions , give guidelines for the application of the rcsr to data , and indicate important directions for future work .",
    "in this section , we review the formalism for electron scattering from nuclei , as it pertains to our development of relativistic coulomb sum rules . we first give some standard results of the plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , which is used for the analysis of @xmath5 experiments on nuclei , in a single - particle basis which accounts for the vector and scalar interactions of qhd - i .",
    "we then give two models for the nucleon form factors off shell , which will be used in the next section to illustrate the sensitivity of the sum rule to different off - shell assumptions .",
    "we begin with the differential cross section for the scattering of ultrarelativistic electrons from nuclear targets , which is commonly written in the form    @xmath26,\\label{ba}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the four - momentum transferred from the electron to the nucleus via virtual photon exchange , and @xmath28 .",
    "the longitudinal contribution in ( [ ba ] ) has been expressed in terms of the coulomb response function    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote initial . ] and final nuclear many - body states , respectively .    in general",
    ", the electromagnetic current density operator @xmath32 may include contributions from both nucleons and charged mesons .",
    "meson exchange current ( mec ) contributions have been considered by schiavilla et .",
    "@xcite , for example , but are not included here . including only nucleons with electromagnetic form factors , the current density operator can be written in the form    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the ( schrdinger picture ) field operator for a point dirac nucleon , and @xmath35 represents the electromagnetic coupling at the @xmath36 vertex .",
    "there is also a sum over proton and neutron isospin projections , which will be suppressed until needed .",
    "any effects of charged mesons not included in the current operator ( [ bc ] ) may be interpreted as two - body effects , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to proceed to a relativistic sum rule",
    ", we shall expand the field operators @xmath34 of ( [ bc ] ) in a plane wave basis , i.e. , in a pwia . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we took this to be the free basis , i.e. , the momentum eigenstates of the free dirac equation . in the present paper",
    ", we shall instead expand the field operators in a basis of plane waves moving in the presence of uniform ( isoscalar ) lorentz scalar and vector potentials , such as would be generated by scalar and vector mesons in a relativistic field theory of nuclei , e.g. , qhd - i . with this modification ,",
    "the theoretical development is formally similar to that of ref .",
    "the consequences of the change of basis show up after the nucleons - only approximation , in which antinucleon degrees of freedom are removed approximately from the spacelike coulomb response . in the following ,",
    "nucleons - only will refer to nucleons in the presence of scalar and vector potentials in the target .",
    "the effect of this modification is to include efficiently the effects of these mean - field potentials in both the initial and final target states .",
    "we therefore use the plane - wave solutions of the dirac equation    @xmath37          \\psi(x)=0,\\label{bd}\\ ] ]    where the scalar and vector potentials are written in the forms @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , corresponding to the scalar and vector fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the associated coupling constants . here , as in the mean - field solution for uniform nuclear matter at rest , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and @xmath40 are constants . the solutions to ( [ bd ] )",
    "are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of uniform fields , the energy eigenvalues of ( [ bd ] ) take the simple form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and the effective nucleon mass is defined @xmath46 . with the nucleons - only approximation ,",
    "we need only consider positive - energy solutions to ( [ bd ] ) .",
    "these are plane wave solutions of momentum @xmath47 , which obey the equation    @xmath48u_s({\\bf p})=0.\\label{be}\\ ] ]    explicit forms for the interacting solutions @xmath49 can be obtained directly from the free solutions , given in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite , by making the replacement @xmath50 .",
    "since the vector potential @xmath51 appears additively in the nucleon eigenenergy , it does not appear in ( [ be ] ) or its plane - wave spinor solutions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we argued that the coulomb response function ( [ bb ] ) for spacelike ( @xmath52 ) photon exchange is dominated by nucleon ( @xmath53 ) contributions to the current matrix elements , and that antinucleon ( @xmath54 ) and pair ( @xmath55 ) terms could be neglected .",
    "this is an exact result for a uniform free fermi gas , and leads to the nucleons - only approximation for interacting nuclear systems .",
    "the presence of a strong scalar field in the nucleus induces mixing of free @xmath56 and @xmath57 states , particularly for nucleons of high momentum , as in the final states of ( [ bb ] ) .",
    "however , transforming to the plane - wave basis formed from the solutions of ( [ be ] ) , hereafter referred to as the `` @xmath0-basis '' , removes this mixing by the potentials .",
    "the nucleons - only approximation is again adopted for interacting nuclei , but here refers to nucleons of mass @xmath0 .",
    "this use of the @xmath0-basis for final states implies substantial interaction of excited ( ejected ) nucleons before leaving the target , and is probably a better assumption for large nuclei than for small .",
    "then the electromagnetic current operator takes the form    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and is a creation operator for a nucleon with spin projection @xmath60 and momentum @xmath47 .",
    "the energy denominators in ( [ bf ] ) reflect the normalization of the plane - wave spinors to @xmath61 particles / volume .",
    "the formal derivation of the rcsr now follows closely that of ref .",
    "@xcite , once we have discussed the form of the electromagnetic vertex operator @xmath62 .",
    "it is conventional to express the @xmath36 vertex operator in the form    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath4 is the free nucleon mass , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the dirac and anomalous form factors , respectively . in general ,",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 are scalar functions of @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath1 .",
    "this form is sufficiently general for matrix elements between nucleon states ( antinucleons excluded ) as in the nucleons - only pwia . since the tensor @xmath69 is antisymmetric , only the three - momentum * q * enters explicitly the coulomb operator @xmath70 .",
    "any remaining dependence the photon energy @xmath6 enters @xmath70 _ only _ through the form factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    for scattering from a free nucleon ,",
    "the form factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 depend only on the scalar @xmath71 . to ensure the correct charge and magnetic moments for free nucleons , they are normalized at @xmath72 according to @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the form factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 are obtained from @xmath5 scattering data , usually in terms of the more convenient sachs electric and magnetic form factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , i.e. , the photon four - momentum is determined by the four - momentum transfer at the @xmath80 vertex . for a single nucleon in free space ,",
    "both energy and momentum are conserved at the @xmath36 vertex as well , and we have @xmath81 .",
    "see appendix a for an alternative form of ( 2.7 ) which is expressed in terms of the sachs form factors .",
    "we use the standard parameterization of the sachs form factors , along with the assumption @xmath82 , as discussed in ref .",
    "this choice has the convenient feature that all sachs form factors are proportional , which satisfies a condition assumed in our derivation of a _ non - energy - weighted _ sum rule in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for interacting nucleons in a nucleus",
    ", one needs information about the form factors off their free mass shell , which is simply not known .",
    "this leaves considerable freedom to extrapolate off shell from the known on - shell forms .",
    "given no other information , a common approach has been to assume that the dependence on @xmath71 of the form factors @xmath83 and @xmath84 does not change off shell from that for a free nucleon .",
    "this implies , at least in part , a separation of the dynamics of the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon from that of the nucleus .",
    "however , even this assumption does not uniquely specify the off - shell form factors , because of the freedom to transform @xmath62 using the gordon identity to other operators with other form factors , each of which are equivalent on shell , but not off shell .",
    "this issue has been considered by de  forest  @xcite , and by chinn and picklesimer  @xcite , who have given examples of possible choices of extrapolation , and studied the sensitivity of the response functions and of the coulomb sum to those choices .",
    "our method is similar in principle , but is based specifically on the gordon transformation which relates @xmath65 and @xmath66 to the free sachs form factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 , given in ( [ bh ] ) for free nucleons .",
    "we consider two possibilities : that the functional dependence on @xmath71 of the functions @xmath83 , @xmath84 is unchanged off shell ( model f ) , or alternatively , that the functional dependence on @xmath71 of the functions @xmath85 , @xmath86 is unchanged off shell ( model g ) .",
    "other choices are possible . for example , in principle , the vector field @xmath43 may also enter the current operator .",
    "we restrict our attention to models f and g , which illustrate the important issues and do not depend on @xmath43 .",
    "the first choice , model f , is the most common ; here it is simply assumed that the dirac and anomalous form factors @xmath83 and @xmath84 are unchanged in the nuclear environment , i.e. , that they are given by ( [ bh ] ) where both the sachs form factors and the kinematic variable @xmath78 are evaluated at the actual momentum transfer of the experiment , i.e. , at the momentum @xmath87 found at the electron vertex .",
    "this is in some sense a minimal assumption , in that the effects of the scalar field enter explicitly the current operator @xmath88 _ only _ through the nucleon field operators . in spite of its apparent simplicity",
    ", this model has the peculiar feature that the dirac and anomalous magnetic moments are treated differently in the nuclear medium .",
    "this follows since the dirac moment ( @xmath89 ) scales with the nucleon mass @xmath0 , as can be seen from the solution of ( [ bd ] ) for a nucleon at rest in the presence of a uniform magnetic field , while the anomalous moment ( @xmath90 ) is unchanged in the medium .",
    "this behavior is possible for a theory with point dirac nucleons dressed by charged meson fields , such as qhd - ii  @xcite , since the anomalous moments in such a theory are typically included explicitly by hand , following a solution of the many - body problem using point nucleons .",
    "however , this behavior is not likely for a theory with internal nucleon electromagnetic structure , such as qcd , since there one expects that the dirac and anomalous magnetic moments may have similar origins , and therefore may respond in a similar manner to the nuclear environment .",
    "an alternative assumption , which we call model g , is that the sachs electric and magnetic form factors @xmath85 and @xmath86 are unchanged in the nuclear medium . to express @xmath62 in the form ( [ bg ] )",
    ", the transformation ( [ bh ] ) is now performed in the @xmath0-basis : the off - shell forms of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are now given in terms of the free sachs form factors by    @xmath91    where the new variable @xmath92/4{m^*}^2 $ ] .",
    "in contrast to model f described above , the off - shell choice ( [ bi ] ) leads to a total nucleon magnetic moment equal to @xmath93 . in particular , the effective dirac and anomalous magnetic moments behave similarly in the nuclear medium .",
    "( note that the factor @xmath94 , appearing on the right - hand side of @xmath66 in ( [ bi ] ) , has the effect of replacing @xmath95 by @xmath96 in ( [ bg ] ) . ) also , since @xmath97 depends _ only _ on the momenta @xmath47 and @xmath98 , the photon energy @xmath6 now enters the form factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 _ only _ through the sachs form factors @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this can be seen by expressing @xmath70 in the alternate form given in ( a5 ) of appendix a. in the next section , we will see that model g leads to relativistic coulomb sum rule which is the direct analog of that derived in the free pwia , but with @xmath50 .",
    "the derivation of a rcsr based on the interacting pwia of section 2 is formally similar to that based on the free pwia of ref .",
    "we begin with the coulomb response function ( [ bb ] ) , and formally evaluate the spacelike coulomb sum ( [ aa ] ) by integration over the photon energy @xmath6 . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , to arrive at a _ non - energy - weighted _ sum rule it must be possible to factor _ all _ dependence on @xmath6 ( which here enters through @xmath71 ) from the current matrix element in ( [ bb ] ) .",
    "this can be accomplished by requiring that the ratio @xmath99 be independent of @xmath6 , since the plane - wave spinors appearing in ( [ bc ] ) are functions only of the 3-momenta * p * and * q*. for a system of dirac protons , for which @xmath100 , this is satisfied trivially . in model g , it is satisfied by explicit construction , using the assumption of proportional sachs form factors . for more complicated off - shell models , such as model f , which do involve explicit dependence on @xmath6 ,",
    "the derivation of a rcsr may require further assumptions . in this article",
    ", we will assume that the above condition is satisfied , and outline the remaining steps which lead to a rcsr .",
    "we next use closure to perform the sum over final states in the squared matrix element . in the nonrelativistic coulomb sum rule ,",
    "in which the integration is over all @xmath6 , the use of closure here is exact . in the relativistic case ,",
    "the use of closure over the spacelike states alone requires certain assumptions about the spacelike nuclear excitation spectrum , as discussed in ref .",
    "these arguments were based primarily on the example of a fermi gas .",
    "we make similar arguments here , and assume that the spacelike spectrum is saturated by the nucleons - only response , where now `` nucleons - only '' refers to positive - energy baryons of mass @xmath0 . after performing the sum over final states @xmath31 ,",
    "the momentum - space anticommutation relations are used to separate one- and two - body terms , as in ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "the relativistic recoil function which appears in ( [ ac ] ) is of the form    @xmath101    where the matrix element is defined by    @xmath102    and @xmath103 represents a nucleon with momentum * p * , spin @xmath60 and isospin projection @xmath16 .",
    "the above expressions are identical in form to those obtained in the free pwia of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with the replacement @xmath50 .",
    "although the one - body term , evaluated using ( [ rjpq ] ) and ( [ jpq ] ) would account _ exactly _ for the relativistic effects of nucleon recoil and fermi motion , it requires knowledge of the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath15 in the target ground state , which is not normally known precisely .",
    "we therefore expand the recoil factor @xmath17 in powers of the nucleon momentum * p * , as in ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming spherical symmetry ,",
    "the one - body term takes the form . ]",
    "@xmath104    where the momentum moments are defined    @xmath105    and @xmath106 for @xmath107 , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we explained that only the first few moments are required to obtain an accurate result for the one - body term . in the next section , we will study how the convergence properties of this moment expansion depend on the parameter @xmath0 , and on the particular choice of off - shell model .",
    "we now give the precise forms of the recoil factor @xmath108 in models f and g.      we first consider model g , in which we assume that the medium dependence of the nucleon electromagnetic coupling is described by the off - shell form factors ( [ bi ] ) . by construction",
    "the form factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 depend on @xmath71 only through their linear dependence on the free sachs form factors , which are assumed to be proportional .",
    "this ensures that the ratio @xmath109 is independent of the photon energy @xmath6 . with this condition satisfied , and",
    "since the baryon spinors are also independent of @xmath6 , the matrix element @xmath110 is a function only of three - momenta and the separation of one- and two - body terms in @xmath23 proceeds as described above , leading to ( [ ac ] ) .    using the form factors ( [ bi ] ) in ( [ bg ] ) to evaluate the matrix element @xmath110 we obtain    @xmath111    where we have defined the electric ( e ) and magnetic ( m ) recoil functions :    @xmath112    and    @xmath113    the functional forms of @xmath114 and @xmath115 can alternatively be obtained by writing @xmath35 of ( 2.7 ) in terms of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as explained in appendix a. in ( [ rg ] ) we have also defined the nucleon electric charge @xmath116 ( in units of the proton charge ) and the total magnetic moment @xmath117 ( in nuclear magnetons ) :    @xmath118    the functional form of the recoil function ( [ rg ] ) is identical to that obtained in the free pwia of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with @xmath50 .",
    "this was ensured by choosing to include the factor @xmath94 in ( [ bi ] ) .",
    "as described above , we expand @xmath17 in powers of the nucleon momentum * p * , which with ( [ ac ] ) , leads to an expression for the one - body term @xmath25 , as in ( [ momexp ] ) .",
    "the expansion coefficients are given in appendix b , and are identical to those obtained in the free pwia of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with @xmath50 . in this model ,",
    "therefore , we can include the relativistic effects of a strong scalar field , in a straightforward extension of the rcsr derived in the free pwia .",
    "we now return to model f , in which we assume that the nucleon form factors are given by ( [ bh ] ) .",
    "now the photon energy @xmath6 enters not only through @xmath71 , which appears in the free sachs form factors , but also through @xmath78 , which enters in the transformation ( [ bh ] ) .",
    "this additional dependence on @xmath6 can _ not _ be removed by simply dividing by an overall factor @xmath119 , as in model g , without some further approximation .    in order to proceed , we will first calculate the matrix element appearing in ( [ rjpq ] ) , using the vertex operator ( [ bg ] ) and the form factors ( [ bh ] ) .",
    "since division by @xmath119 is not sufficient to render the matrix element a function only of the momenta * p * and * q * , this function will not yet lead to the one - body term of the coulomb sum rule .",
    "however , it does serve as a useful starting point to illustrate the important issues .",
    "we obtain    @xmath120 ^ 2\\ r_e({\\bf p},{\\bf q } )      + \\biggl[{{g_{m\\sigma}^*}(q^2,\\tilde\\tau^ * )      \\over g_{ep}(q^2)}\\biggr]^2\\ r_m({\\bf p},{\\bf q } ) ,      \\label{rf}\\ ] ]    where we have emphasized explicitly the dependence on @xmath71 .",
    "the form of ( [ rf ] ) is similar to ( 3.5 ) for model g , but with `` effective '' sachs electric and magnetic form factors , defined by :    @xmath121    which reduce to the free sachs form factors if @xmath122 .",
    "inserting @xmath83 , @xmath84 of ( [ bh ] ) into ( [ gsdef ] ) , we have    @xmath123+\\mu_\\sigma\\ \\biggl[{\\tau-{m^*\\over m}\\tilde      \\tau^*\\over1+\\tau}\\biggr]\\nonumber\\\\&&\\label{gsofg}\\\\      { g_{m\\sigma}^*(q^2,\\tilde\\tau^*)\\over g_{ep}(q^2)}&= &      \\epsilon_\\sigma\\ \\biggl[{1-{m^*\\over m}\\over1+\\tau}\\biggr ]      + \\mu_\\sigma\\ \\biggl[{\\tau+{m^*\\over m}\\over1+\\tau}\\biggr ] ,      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which illustrates of `` mixing '' of ( free ) electric and magnetic contributions in this model .",
    "this mixing enters as a result of the reduced effective nucleon mass , and is distinct from the usual lorentz mixing which occurs for a moving particle .",
    "effective form factors of the sort ( 3.11 ) can also be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "to continue the derivation of a _ non - energy - weighted _ sum rule , we must make some assumption about the remaining @xmath6-dependence , which arises through the variable @xmath124 in ( 3.11 ) .",
    "a simple method is based on the excitation energy of a uniform fermi gas in qhd - i , which is expressible simply in terms of the three - momenta * p * and * q * : @xmath125 .",
    "we therefore make the replacement in ( 3.11 ) :    @xmath126    to obtain energy - independent effective form factors .",
    "the factor @xmath127 arises directly from the definition of @xmath124 following ( 2.8 ) . with the replacement ( [ tau ] ) in ( 3.11 ) ,",
    "the recoil function ( 3.9 ) is now independent of the photon energy @xmath6 , and the derivation of a non - energy - weighted coulomb sum rule for model f proceeds as for model g.    at this point , it is possible to expand ( 3.9 ) about @xmath128 and obtain a moment expansion for @xmath25 , as in ( [ momexp ] ) .",

    "note that the moment expansion converges more slowly for smaller @xmath0 , as can be seen by comparing @xmath169 in figures 3a and 3b . still , the rcsr to @xmath168 is reasonably accurate , even for @xmath177 .",

    "we emphasize that in both models f and g , the rcsr was evaluated using the _ same _ moment expansion coefficients ( those in appendix b ) , but in model f the effective charges and magnetic moments depend on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this simplification requires using a factored moment expansion , in which fermi motion effects entering though the effective form factors @xmath186 , @xmath187 are ignored . in the cases studied",
    "this is an excellent approximation , as explained further below .",
    "one can understand the results just presented by looking individually at the electric and magnetic recoil functions @xmath114 and @xmath115 , defined in ( [ repq ] ) and ( [ rmpq ] ) , as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall look at the variations of @xmath188 and @xmath189 of ( 3.14 ) in model f , compared to @xmath116 and @xmath117 in model g. we are especially interested in the factored moment expansion in model f. we shall examine the reasons for its success , and under what conditions such an approach may be expected to work for other off - shell assumptions .",
    "we argue that a factored moment expansion , like that adopted here , should be accurate in a large class of off - shell form factor models .    in figures 5a and 5b ,",
    "we show the electric and magnetic recoil functions : @xmath129 of ( [ repq ] ) and @xmath130 of ( [ rmpq ] ) , for two values of @xmath0 . in both figures , the solid curve represents the electric term @xmath190 , which dominates the coulomb response for a system of dirac nucleons .",
    "the magnetic term @xmath191 , as can be seen from the second equality in ( [ rmpq ] ) .",

    "these limits are independent of @xmath0 , however , for smaller @xmath0 , @xmath190 decreases more rapidly with @xmath1 , since it is a monotonic function of @xmath195 .",
    "this increased suppression is easily accommodated by using an appropriate value for @xmath0 , as discussed for the dirac case in figure 1 .",
    "the corrections for fermi motion to @xmath114 and @xmath115 are also shown in figures 5a and 5b , and are denoted by @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively .",

    "@xmath198 and @xmath199 enter the response with equal weighting .",
    "we noted in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath162 that this leads to a nearly exact cancellation over the entire momentum range , and ensures that the lowest - order sum rule , rcsr - i , is accurate to within @xmath164 .",
    "note that this cancellation persists to @xmath164 accuracy for @xmath24 , although _ both _ @xmath198 and @xmath199 nearly triple for @xmath177 , as in the mft example .    for nucleons with anomalous magnetic moments ,",
    "this near cancellation of @xmath196 and @xmath197 no longer occurs , since these function are multiplied by different factors : @xmath200 , @xmath201 of ( 3.8 ) for model g , or @xmath202 , @xmath203 of ( 3.14 ) for model f. in model g , @xmath197 is multiplied by the constant factor @xmath167 , while @xmath204 . for @xmath162 , this gives a 1020% increase in the coulomb sum @xmath23 , as was discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath205 decreases , the enhanced effect of @xmath197 increases further : for @xmath206 , the fermi motion correction increases with @xmath1 about as quickly as @xmath190 decreases , as shown in fig .",
    "this leads to the behavior of @xmath23 for this value of @xmath0 , shown in fig .",
    "3b , and remarked on earlier , i.e. , @xmath207 .",
    "as @xmath0 is decreased to the mft value , this increase in @xmath199 effectively triples the importance of higher moments .",
    "this accounts for the decreased accuracy of the rcsr at @xmath168 , compared to that applied to free nucleons .",
    "model f has qualitatively similar behavior , as we saw in figs .",
    "4a and 4b . here , however , @xmath23 is modified by the effective charges and moments ( 3.14 ) , which are shown in fig .",
    "6 ( solid curves ) . for this case",

    "3a and 3b , and the upturn with increasing @xmath1 in fig .",
    "we have seen that the convergence properties of the rcsr in model f are similar to those in model g , in spite of the use of a factored moment expansion that ignores certain fermi motion effects , which would enter through the effective form factors ( 3.11 ) . in order to understand this result , we first examine the effective form factors themselves . in figure 6",
    ", we show these in the form in which they enter the recoil function @xmath210 in model f , i.e. , @xmath211 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath212 ^ 2 $ ] .",

    "we see that the fermi motion corrections to the ratios @xmath184 ^ 2 $ ] are small compared to the ratios themselves .",

    "( terms @xmath214 vanish upon angle - integration with spherical symmetry , and therefore do not contribute to the results in figure 6 . )    to understand the success of the factored moment expansion , consider the second - order sum rule , @xmath169 .",
    "it omits two types of fermi corrections : 1 ) @xmath168 terms which come from a moment expansion of the effective form factors and multiply @xmath190 and @xmath215 , and 2 ) products of linear terms involving @xmath216 , one term from the effective form factors , and one from the recoil factors @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the first of these make at most @xmath185 correction to the electric contribution , and less than @xmath164 correction to the magnetic , as can be seen from figure 6 .",
    "these terms can therefore be neglected to a good approximation .",
    "linear terms do not enter the magnetic contribution , as can be seen from the @xmath217 factor in ( [ rmpq ] ) .",
    "linear terms have been omitted from the electric contribution , and could in principle have been appreciable .",
    "in fact , these terms taken together result in less than a @xmath218 error in the rcsr , as can be seen by comparing the dashed and dot - dashed curves for @xmath169 in figures 4a and 4b .",
    "thus the success of the factored moment expansion in model f can be attributed to the smallness of fermi corrections in the effective form factors themselves , and in part to the complete absence of linear terms in the magnetic contribution .",
    "we believe that the success of the factored moment expansion in model f may also occur for a much wider variety of off - shell models than we have considered here .",
    "the basis for this claim is that fermi corrections tend to be small in general , representing effects of order @xmath219 .",
    "the main exception is the magnetic correction , which is substantial because of two properties : @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "the magnetic contribution @xmath199 is small , but is then enhanced by roughly an order of magnitude by the anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "no such enhancement occurs for @xmath198 .",
    "thus in model f , the further corrections due to * p*-dependence in @xmath211 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath212 ^ 2 $ ] are negligible . in other off - shell models ,",
    "for which @xmath17 is expressible in the form ( 3.9 ) , we expect fermi motion effects in the corresponding effective form factors also to be small .",
    "we therefore propose that a factored moment expansion , like that employed here in model f , may also be accurate for the evaluation of fermi motion effects a wide variety of off - shell models .",
    "this allows one to evaluate the rcsr using the expansion coefficients given in appendix b.

    "the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows : the effects of nuclear binding in the mean - field approximation enter the coulomb response function @xmath7 and the coulomb sum @xmath23 in a way that can be characterized by a reduced effective mass @xmath0 .",

    "since the rcsr has been derived in momentum space , such a modification is relatively straightforward . as a first approximation ,",
    "which is consistent with our conclusion that fermi motion effects tend to be small , it seems reasonable to use @xmath233 for initial states and @xmath234 for final states .",
    "this prescription preserves the basic structure of the rcsr , in that no further dependence on @xmath47 is introduced",
    ". this would require the initial- and final - state masses to be treated distinctly , however , and would complicate the form of the coefficients in appendix b.    we are currently investigating the effects of virtual @xmath55 pairs ( of mass @xmath0 ) on the rcsr , as they enter intermediate excited states in the random phase approximation .",
    "these were considered previously by horowitz  @xcite , and appear to be significant .",
    "we are also interested in how energy dependent terms , which can enter in off - shell models where a substitution of the form ( 3.12 ) is not appropriate , affect the rcsr .",
