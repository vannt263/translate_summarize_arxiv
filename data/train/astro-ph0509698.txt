    "research by helmholtz , kelvin and others throughout the second half of the 19th century made it clear that neither gravity nor any other then known energy source could account for the geologically determined age of the sun and solar system .",
    "enlightened by rutherford s 1911 discovery of the atomic nucleus , eddington and others suggested that nuclear transmutations might be the remedy to this quandary . with the burgeoning knowledge of the properties of nuclei and",
    "nuclear reactions in the 1930s , 1940s and 1950s came a growing understanding of the role that individual nuclear reaction played in the synthesis of the elements . in 1957 ,",
    "burbidge , burbidge , fowler & hoyle @xcite and cameron @xcite wove these threads into a cohesive theory of nucleosynthesis , and demonstrated how the solar isotopic abundances bore the fingerprints of their astrophysical origins . today , investigations refine our answers to these same two questions ; how are the elements we see on earth and throughout the universe formed , and how do these nuclear transmutations , and the energy they release , affect their astrophysical hosts ?    in this article , we will review the numerical methods used to study these questions .",
    "two basic numerical methods are at the heart of the study of thermonuclear kinetics in astrophysics , the tracking of nuclear transmutations via rate equations and via equilibria .",
    "we will also briefly discuss work which seeks to meld these methods together in order to overcome the limitations of each .",
    "additionally we will discuss the issues encountered when coupling the nuclear evolution to hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "composed of a system of first order differential equations , the nuclear reaction network has sink and source terms representing each of the many nuclear reactions involved . prior to discussing the numerical difficulties posed by the nuclear reaction network ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the sets of equations we are attempting to solve . to this end",
    ", we present a brief overview of the thermonuclear reaction rates of interest and how these rates are assembled into the differential equations that must ultimately be solved . for more detailed information ,",
    "we refer the reader to several textbooks covering this subjects @xcite .",
    "we will end this section by briefly discussing the coupling of nucleosynthesis with hydrodynamics .",
    "there are a large number of types of nuclear reactions which are of astrophysical interest .",
    "in addition to the emission or absorption of nuclei and nucleons , nuclear reactions can involve the emission or absorption of photons ( @xmath0-rays ) and leptons ( electrons , neutrinos , and their anti - particles ) . as a result ,",
    "nuclear reactions involve three of the four fundamental forces , the nuclear strong , electromagnetic and nuclear weak forces .",
    "reactions involving leptons ( termed weak interactions ) proceed much more slowly than those involving only nucleons and photons ; however , these reactions are important because only weak interactions can change the global ratio of protons to neutrons .    the most basic piece of information about any nuclear reaction is the nuclear cross section .",
    "the cross section for a reaction between target @xmath1 and projectile @xmath2 is defined by @xmath3 the second equality holds when the relative velocity between targets of number density @xmath4 and projectiles of number density @xmath5 is constant and has the value @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath7 , the number of reactions per @xmath8  and sec , can be expressed as @xmath9 .",
    "more generally , the targets and projectiles have distributions of velocities , in which case @xmath7 is given by @xmath10 the evaluation of this integral depends on the types of particles and distributions which are involved . for nuclei @xmath1 and @xmath2 in an astrophysical plasma ,",
    "maxwell - boltzmann statistics generally apply ; thus , @xmath11    allowing @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be moved outside of the integral .",
    ".  [ eq : rate ] can then be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13  is the velocity integrated cross section .",
    "equivalently , one can express the reaction rate in terms of a mean lifetime of particle @xmath1 against destruction by particle @xmath2 , @xmath14 for thermonuclear reactions , these integrated cross sections have the form @xcite",
    "@xmath15    where @xmath16 denotes the reduced mass of the target - projectile system , @xmath17 the center of mass energy , @xmath18 the temperature and @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for these reaction rates provide the data input necessary to study astrophysical thermonuclear kinetics .",
    "while detailed discussion of individual rates is beyond the scope of this article , the interested reader is directed to the following reviews , in this volume and elsewhere .",
    "experimental nuclear rates and the methodology for measuring them have been reviewed in detail by @xcite .",
    "a number of articles in this volume review the charged particle reaction rates which are important in the sun @xcite , in later stages of stellar evolution @xcite , and for explosive burning on compact objects @xcite . experimental neutron capture cross sections",
    "are also summarized @xcite .",
    "theoretical modeling of these rates @xcite is vitally important to provide the many rates for which experimental information is incomplete or non - existant . beyond measuring or calculating these rates , progress in nuclear astrophysics also requires the compilation and dissemination ( in a usable form ) of this hard - earned nuclear data to the broadest astrophysical community @xcite .    when particle @xmath2 in eq .",
    "[ eq : rate ] is a photon , the distribution @xmath20 is given by the plank distribution .",
    "furthermore , the relative velocity is always @xmath21 and thus the integral is separable , simplifying to @xmath22 in practice it is not usually necessary to directly evaluate the photodisintegration cross sections ( see , however , @xcite for exceptions ) , because they can be expressed by detailed balance in terms of the capture cross sections for the inverse reaction , @xmath23 @xcite . @xmath24",
    "this expression depends on the partition functions , @xmath25 ( which account for the populations of the excited states of the nucleus ) , the mass numbers , @xmath26 , the temperature @xmath18 , the inverse reaction rate @xmath27 , and the reaction @xmath28-value ( the energy released by the reaction ) , @xmath29 .",
    "since photodisintegrations are endoergic , their rates are vanishingly small until sufficient photons exist in the high energy tail of the planck distribution with energies @xmath30 . as a rule of thumb",
    "this requires @xmath18@xmath31@xmath32 .    in practice , these experimental and theoretical reaction rates are determined for bare nuclei , while in astrophysical plasmas , these reactions occur among a background of other nuclei and electrons . as a result of this background , the reacting nuclei experience a coulomb repulsion modified from that of bare nuclei . for high densities and/or low temperatures ,",
    "the effects of this screening of reactions becomes very important .",
    "under most conditions ( with non - vanishing temperatures ) the generalized reaction rate integral can be separated into the traditional expression without screening [ eq .",
    "[ eq : sigv ] ] and a screening factor , @xmath33 this screening factor is dependent on the charge of the involved particles , the density , temperature , and the composition of the plasma . for more details on the form of @xmath34 ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . at high densities and low temperatures screening factors",
    "can enhance reactions by many orders of magnitude and lead to _",
    "pycnonuclear ignition_. in the extreme case of very low temperatures , where reactions are only possible via ground state oscillations of the nuclei in a coulomb lattice , eq .",
    "[ eq : screen ] breaks down , because it was derived under the assumption of a boltzmann distribution @xcite .    in stellar plasmas , target nuclei",
    "also do not exist solely in their ground states .",
    "this complicates the rate expression in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigv ] , which now must take into account the cross sections for capture out of the different excited states and properly weight them according to their probability of occurrence in the ensemble of target nuclei . because the timescales for transitions between excited states of a nucleus are typically much shorter than other reaction timescales , it is usually valid to assume that the nuclei are internally equilibrated and a given excited state is populated in the ensemble by the usual boltzmann factor @xmath35 , where @xmath17 now is the excitation energy of that state . from this , one may derive a factor , called the _ stellar enhancement factor _ ( sef ) , to correct the ground - state reaction rate for the population of excited states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "interesting complications to this prescription arise when the internal equilibration timescale for a nucleus exceeds the other reaction timescales in the problem .",
    "this usually occurs when a large spin difference between the ground state of an isotope and its first excited state prevents them from communicating directly via internal transitions .",
    "the isotope @xmath36al is the prototypical example , with a ground and isomeric state of spin and parity @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "when these two states equilibrate , it is not through a direct transition between the states  that simply takes too long .",
    "rather the equilibration occurs through transitions to higher - lying levels that communicate effectively with both levels .",
    "this problem has been studied in detail ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the most straightforward way of dealing with this is to assume that the higher - lying levels are in a steady state since their destruction timescales are so rapid .",
    "when this is done , the population of the target nucleus break up into two ensembles , one tied to the ground state and one tied to the isomer @xcite .",
    "these may then be treated as separate species in the network , each with its own rates to and from other isotopes and with effective rates for transitions between the two ensembles .",
    "fortunately , the number of nuclei requiring such treatment is small and does not add much computational burden to running the nuclear reaction network .    a procedure similar to that used to derive eq .",
    "[ eq : phrate ] applies to captures of electrons by nuclei . because the electron is 1836 times less massive than a nucleon , the velocity of the nucleus @xmath1 in the center of mass system is negligible in comparison to the electron velocity ( @xmath39 ) . in the neutral , completely ionized plasmas typical of the astrophysical sites of nucleosynthesis , the electron number density , @xmath40 ,",
    "is equal to the total density of protons in nuclei , @xmath41 .",
    "however in many of these astrophysical settings the electrons are at least partially degenerate , therefore the electron distribution can not be assumed to be maxwellian . instead the capture cross section may be integrated over a boltzmann , partially degenerate , or degenerate fermi distribution of electrons , depending on the astrophysical conditions .",
    "the resulting electron capture rates are functions of @xmath18 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 similar equations apply for the capture of positrons which are in thermal equilibrium with photons , electrons , and nuclei .",
    "electron and positron capture calculations have been performed for a large variety of nuclei with mass numbers between a=20 and a=100 ( see @xcite for more information ) . for normal decays , like beta or alpha decays , with a characteristic half - life @xmath44 , eq .",
    "[ eq : phrate ] also applies , with the decay constant @xmath45 .",
    "in addition to innumerable experimental half - life determinations , beta - decay half - lives for a wide range of unstable nuclei have been predicted ( see @xcite ) .    even though the size of the neutrino scattering cross section on nuclei and electrons is very small , at high densities ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "enough scattering events occur to thermalize the neutrino distribution . under such conditions",
    "the inverse process to electron capture ( neutrino capture ) can occur in significant numbers and the neutrino capture rate can be expressed in a form similar to eqs .",
    "[ eq : phrate ] by integrating over the thermal neutrino distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "inelastic neutrino scattering on nuclei can also be expressed in this form .",
    "the latter can cause particle emission , similar to photodisintegration .",
    "in this volume , see @xcite for more complete discussion of the interactions of neutrinos with matter",
    ". the calculation of these rates can be further complicated by the neutrinos being out of thermal equilibrium with the local environment .",
    "when thermal equilibrium among neutrinos was established at a different location , then the neutrino distribution might be characterized by a chemical potential and a temperature different from the local values .",
    "otherwise , the neutrino distribution must be evolved in detail ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the large number of reaction types discussed in  [ sect : reacrate ] can be divided into 3 functional categories based on the number of reactants which are nuclei .",
    "the reactions involving a single nucleus , which include decays , electron and positron captures , photodisintegrations , and neutrino induced reactions , depend on the number density of only the target species .",
    "for reaction involving two nuclei , the reaction rate depends on the number densities of both target and projectile nuclei .",
    "there are also a few important three - particle process ( like the triple-@xmath47  process , see  [ sect : hyb ] ) which are commonly successive captures with an intermediate unstable target ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . using an equilibrium abundance for the unstable intermediate , the contributions of these reactions are commonly written in the form of a three - particle processes , depending on a trio of number densities .",
    "grouping reactions by these 3 functional categories , the time derivatives of the number densities of each nuclear species in an astrophysical plasma can be written in terms of the reaction rates , @xmath7 , as @xmath48 where the three sums are over reactions which produce or destroy a nucleus of species @xmath49 with 1 , 2 & 3 reactant nuclei , respectively .",
    "the @xmath50  s provide for proper accounting of numbers of nuclei and are given by : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 can be positive or negative numbers that specify how many particles of species @xmath49 are created or destroyed in a reaction , while the denominators , including factorials , run over the @xmath55 or @xmath56 different species destroyed in the reaction and avoid double counting of the number of reactions when identical particles react with each other ( for example in the @xmath57 + @xmath57 or the triple-@xmath47  reactions ; for details see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to nuclear reactions , expansion or contraction of the plasma can also produce changes in the number densities @xmath58 .",
    "to separate the nuclear changes in composition from these hydrodynamic effects , the nuclear abundance @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is avogadro s number , is commonly used . for a nucleus with atomic weight @xmath61",
    ", @xmath62 represents the mass fraction of this nucleus , therefore @xmath63 .",
    "likewise , the equation of charge conservation becomes @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the electron abundance ( also termed the electron fraction ) . by recasting eq .",
    "[ eq : ndot ] in terms of nuclear abundances @xmath66 , a set of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of @xmath67 results which depends only on nuclear reactions . in terms of the reaction cross sections introduced in  [ sect : reacrate ] , this reaction network is described by the following set of differential equations @xmath68      as we touched on in the previous section , nuclear processes are tightly linked to the hydrodynamic behavior of the bulk medium .",
    "thermonuclear processes release ( or absorb ) energy , which alters the pressure and causes hydrodynamic motions . these motions may disperse the thermonuclear ash and bring a continued supply of fuel to support the thermonuclear flame .",
    "the compositional changes caused by thermonuclear reactions can also change the equation of state and opacity , further impacting the hydrodynamic behavior . for purposes of this review of thermonuclear kinetics methods , which generally assume that thermonuclear and hydrodynamic changes in local composition can be successfully decoupled ( or treated in an operator split fashion ) ,",
    "we include only a brief description of how this decoupling is best achieved .",
    "mller @xcite provides an authoritative overview and discusses the difficulties ( and open issues ) involved when including nucleosynthesis within hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the coupling between thermonuclear processes and hydrodynamic changes can be divided into two categories by considering the spatial extent of the coupling .",
    "nucleosynthetic changes in composition and the resultant energy release produce _",
    "local _ changes in hydrodynamic quantities like pressure and temperature .",
    "the strongest of these local couplings is the release ( or absorption ) of energy and the resultant change in temperature .",
    "changes in temperature are particularly important because of the exponential nature of the temperature dependence of thermonuclear reaction rates .",
    "since the nuclear energy release is uniquely determined by the abundance changes , the rate of thermonuclear energy release , @xmath69 , is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the rest mass energy of species @xmath49 in @xmath72 .",
    "since all reactions conserve nucleon number , the atomic mass excess @xmath73",
    "( @xmath74 is the atomic mass unit ) can be used in place of the mass @xmath75 in eq .",
    "[ eq : edot ] ( see @xcite for a recent compilation of mass excesses ) .",
    "the use of atomic mass units has the added benefit that electron conservation is correctly accounted for in the case of @xmath76 decays and @xmath77 captures , though reactions involving positrons require careful treatment . in general , the nuclear energy release is deposited locally , so the rate of thermonuclear energy release is equal to the nuclear portion of the hydrodynamic heating rate .",
    "however , there are instances where nuclear products do not deposit their energy locally . escaping neutrinos can carry away a portion of the thermonuclear energy release . in the rarefied environment of supernova ejecta at late times , positrons and gamma rays released by @xmath78 decays",
    "are not completely trapped . in most such cases ,",
    "the escaping particles stream freely from the reaction site , allowing adoption of a simple loss term analogous to eq .",
    "[ eq : edot ] with @xmath71 replaced by an averaged energy loss term . for this reason , weak reaction rate tabulations provide averaged neutrino losses . from these",
    "we can construct @xmath79 where we consider only those contributions to @xmath80 due to neutrino producing reactions . in some cases , like supernovae",
    ", subsequent interactions between the escaping leptons or gamma rays and matter require more complete transport to be considered .",
    "other important quantities which are impacted by nucleosynthesis , like @xmath81 , can be obtained by appropriate sums over the abundances and also need not be evolved separately .",
    "implicit solution methods require the calculation of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the nuclear timestep , which in turn requires knowledge of @xmath84 .",
    "one could write a differential equation for the energy release analogous to eq .",
    "[ eq : ydot ] , with the @xmath50s replaced by the reaction @xmath28-values , and thereby evolve the energy release ( and calculate temperature changes ) as an additional equation within the network solution .",
    "mller @xcite has shown that such a scheme can help avoid instabilities in the case of a physically isolated zone entering or leaving nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "in general , however , use of this additional equation is made unnecessary by the relative slowness with which the temperature changes .",
    "the timescale on which the temperature changes is given by @xmath85 and is often called the _",
    "ignition timescale_. the timescale on which an individual abundance changes is its _ burning time _ , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] . in general @xmath88 differs from @xmath89 of the principle fuel by the ratio of thermal energy content to the energy released by the reaction . for degenerate matter",
    "this ratio can approach zero , allowing for explosive burning .",
    "in contrast , accurate prediction of less abundant , but still important , species requires that the reaction network timestep @xmath83 be chosen to be the burning timescale of a less abundant species , typically with an abundance of @xmath90 or smaller @xcite . since the dominant fuel is most often one of the more abundant constituents and the burning timescales are proportional to the abundance , @xmath88 is typically an order of magnitude or more larger than the reaction network timestep ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to calculate the energy gain at the end of a timestep via equation  [ eq : edot ] , modified as discussed above , and approximate @xmath91 or to extrapolate based on @xmath92(t ) .",
    "since other locally coupled quantities have characteristic timescales much longer than @xmath83 , they too can be decoupled in a similar fashion . for the remainder of this review",
    ", we will consider only the equations governing changes in isotopic abundances , remembering that additional equations can easily be constructed for those special circumstances where they are necessary .",
    "spatial coupling , particularly the modification of the composition by hydrodynamic movements such as diffusion , convective mixing and advection ( in the case of eulerian hydrodynamics methods ) , represents a more difficult challenge . by necessity",
    ", an individual nucleosynthesis calculation examines the abundance changes in a locality of uniform composition .",
    "the difficulties associated with strong spatial coupling of the composition occur because this nucleosynthetic calculation is spread over an entire hydrodynamic zone .",
    "convection can result in strong abundance gradients across a single hydrodynamic zone , which with the assumption of compositional uniformity , can result in very different outcomes as a function of the fineness of the hydrodynamic grid .",
    "thermonuclear supernovae , where the thickness of the flame front can be billionths of the radius of the white dwarf @xcite , present an extreme example of microscopic nuclear inhomogeneity .",
    "eulerian advection of compositional boundaries can also have extremely unphysical consequences .",
    "fryxell  @xcite demonstrated how this artificial mixing can produce an unphysical detonation in a shock tube calculation by mixing cold unburnt fuel into the hot burnt region .",
    "a related problem is the conservation of species .",
    "hydrodynamic schemes must carefully conserve the abundances ( or partial densities ) of all species @xcite , lest they provide unphysical abundances to the nucleosynthesis calculations , which must assume conservation , and thereby produce unphysical results .",
    "because of these problems , hydrodynamic methods with excellent capture of shocks and contact or compositional discontinuities are best suited to nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "the relative size of the burning timescales , when compared to the relevant diffusion , sound crossing or convective timescale , dictates how these problems must be addressed .",
    "if all of the burning timescales are much shorter than the timescale on which the hydrodynamics changes the composition , then the assumption of uniform composition is satisfied and the nucleosynthesis of each hydrodynamic zone can be treated independently .",
    "if all of the burning timescales are much larger than , for example , the convective timescale , then the composition of the entire convective zone can be treated as uniform and slowly evolving .",
    "the greatest complexity occurs when the timescales on which the hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis change the composition are similar .",
    "oxygen shell burning represents an excellent example of this as the sound travel , convective turnover and nuclear burning timescales are all of the same order as the evolutionary time .",
    "the results of 2d simulations @xcite demonstrate convective overshooting , highly non - uniform burning and a velocity structure dominated by convective plumes .",
    "in section [ sect : sparse ] we will briefly discuss the numerical challenges posed by fully coupling nucleosynthesis and nuclear mixing .",
    "silicon burning represents a different challenge @xcite , as the timescales for the transformation of silicon to iron are much slower than the convective turnover time , but the burning timescales for the free neutrons , protons and @xmath93-particles which maintain qse are much faster , providing a strong motivation for the hybrid reaction networks we will discuss in  [ sect : hyb ] .",
    "in principle , the initial value problem presented by the nuclear reaction network can be solved by any of a large number of methods discussed in the literature . however the physical nature of the problem , reflected in the @xmath94 s and @xmath13 s , greatly restricts the optimal choice .",
    "the large number of reactions display a wide range of reaction timescales , @xmath95 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "numerical systems whose solutions depend on a wide range of timescales are termed _",
    "stiff_. gear @xcite demonstrated that even a single equation can be stiff if it has both rapidly and slowly varying components .",
    "practically , stiffness occurs when the limitation of the timestep size is due to numerical stability rather than accuracy .",
    "a more rigorous definition @xcite is that a system of equations @xmath96 is stiff if the eigenvalues @xmath97 of the jacobian @xmath98 obey the criterion that for negative @xmath99 ( the real part of the eigenvalues @xmath100 ) @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "as we will explain in this section , @xmath103 is not uncommon in astrophysics .",
    "astrophysical calculations of nucleosynthesis belong to the general field of reactive flows , and therefore share some characteristics with related terrestrial fields .",
    "in particular , chemical kinetics , the study of the evolution of chemical abundances , is an important part of atmospheric and combustion physics and produces sets of equations much like eq .",
    "[ eq : ndot ] ( see @xcite for a through introduction ) .",
    "these chemical kinetics systems are known for their stiffness and a great deal of effort has been expended on developing methods to solve these equations .",
    "many of the considerations for the choice of solution method for chemical kinetics also apply to thermonuclear kinetics . in both cases , temporal integration of the reaction rate equations",
    "is broken up into short intervals because of the need to update the hydrodynamics variables .",
    "this favors one step , self starting algorithms .",
    "because abundances must be tracked for a large number of computational cells ( hundreds to thousands for one dimensional models , millions to billions for the coming generation of three dimensional models ) , memory storage concerns favor low order methods since they do nt require the storage of as much data from prior steps . in any event , both the errors in fluid dynamics and in the reaction rates are typically a few percent or more , so the greater precision of these higher order methods often does not result in greater accuracy .",
    "note that these statements do not in general apply to calculations of big bang nucleosynthesis ( at least those that assume homogeniety ) . as a result quite different methods are employed in these calculations @xcite    because of the wide range in timescales between strong , electromagnetic and weak reactions , nuclear reaction networks are extraordinarily stiff .",
    "pp chain nucleosynthesis , responsible for the energy output of the sun , offers an excellent example of the difficulties .",
    "the first reaction of the pp1 chain is @xmath104 , the fusion of two protons to form deuterium .",
    "this is a weak reaction , requiring the conversion of a proton into a neutron , and releasing a positron and a neutrino . as a result ,",
    "the reaction timescale @xmath105 is very long , billions of years for conditions like those in the solar interior .",
    "the second reaction of the pp1 chain is the capture of a proton on the newly formed deuteron , @xmath106 . for conditions like those in the solar interior , the characteristic timescale",
    ", @xmath107 is a few seconds .",
    "thus the timescales for two of the most important reactions for hydrogen burning in stars like our sun differ by more than 17 orders of magnitude ( see @xcite for a more complete discussion of the pp chain ) .",
    "this disparity results not from a lack of @xmath108 + @xmath108 collisions ( which occur at a rate @xmath109 times more often than @xmath108 + @xmath110 collisions ) , but from the rarity of the transformation of a proton to a neutron .",
    "while the presence of weak reactions among the dominant energy producing reactions is unique to hydrogen burning , most nucleosynthesis calculations are similarly stiff , in part because of the need to include weak interactions but also the potential for neutron capture reactions , which occur very rapidly even at low temperature , following any release of free neutrons .",
    "the nature of the nuclear reaction network equations has thus far limited the astrophysical usefulness of the most sophisticated methods to solve stiff equations developed for chemical kinetics .",
    "however work to harness this resource continues .",
    "for example , timmes @xcite has examined higher order kaps - rentrop and bader - deuflhard semi - implicit time integration algorithms while mott  @xcite have studied asymptotic and quasi - steady state methods , which do not require a matrix solution .    for a set of nuclear abundances @xmath111",

    "this is especially a problem near equilibrium , where both destruction and the balancing production timescales are very short in comparison to the preferred timestep size , resulting in differences close to the numerical accuracy ( i.e. 14 or more orders of magnitude ) . in such cases , the term @xmath129 is numerically neglected , leading to numerically singular matrices .",
    "one approach to avoiding this problem is to artificially scale these short , equilibrium timescales by a factor which brings their timescale closer to @xmath83 , but leaves them small enough to ensure equilibrium .",
    "while this approach has been used successfully , the ad hoc nature of this artificial scaling renders these methods fragile .",
    "a more promising approach is to make directly use of equilibrium expressions for abundances , which , as we will discuss in ",
    "[ sect : hyb ] , also ensures the economical use of computer resources .      for larger nuclear reaction networks ,",
    "the newton - raphson method requires solution of a moderately large ( @xmath132 ) matrix equation for each zone .",
    "since general solution of a dense matrix scales as @xmath133 , this can make these large networks progressively much more expensive .",
    "while in principal , every species reacts with each of the hundreds of others , resulting in a dense jacobian matrix , in practice it is possible to neglect most of these reactions . because of the @xmath134 dependence of the repulsive coulomb term in the nuclear potential , captures of free neutrons and isotopes of h and he on heavy nuclei occur much faster than fusions of heavier nuclei . furthermore , with the exception of the big bang nucleosynthesis and pp - chains , reactions involving secondary isotopes of h ( deuterium and tritium ) and he are neglectable .",
    "likewise , photodisintegrations tend to eject free nucleons or @xmath47-particles .",
    "thus , with a few important exceptions , for each nucleus we need only consider twelve reactions linking it to its nuclear neighbors by the capture of an @xmath135 or @xmath0 and release a different one of these four .",
    "the exceptions to this rule are the few heavy ion reactions important for burning stages like carbon and oxygen burning where the dearth of light nuclei cause the heavy ion collisions to dominate .",
    "[ fig : sparse ] demonstrates the sparseness of the resulting jacobian matrix , for a 300 nuclei network chosen to handle all the energy generating stages in the life of a massive star .",
    "the nuclei are indexed in order of increasing z and then a. of the 90,000 matrix elements , fewer than 5,000 are non - zero . in terms of the standard forms for sparse matrices ,",
    "this jacobian is best described as doubly bordered , band diagonal . with a border width , @xmath136 , of 45 necessary to include the heavy ion reactions among @xmath57 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 along with the free neutrons , protons and @xmath47-particles and a band diagonal width , @xmath139 , of 54 , even this sparse form includes almost 50,000 elements . with solution of the matrix equation consuming 90+% of the computational time , there is clearly a need for custom tailored solvers which take better advantage of the sparseness of the jacobian @xcite .",
    "to date best results for small ( n@xmath140100 ) matrices are obtained with machine optimized dense solvers ( e.g.  lapack ) or matrix specific solvers generated by symbolic processing @xcite . for large matrices , generalized sparse solvers ,",
    "both custom built and from software libraries , are used ( see , @xcite ) .    thus far in this section",
    "we have considered thermonuclear kinetics in the limit where the hydrodynamics is treated separately by operator - splitting . however , as we discussed in  [ sect : hydro ] , this is approach is not always viable , so we conclude this section with some remarks on the additional challenges encountered in recent efforts to solve coupled nucleosynthesis and hydrodynamical mixing .",
    "because these calculations must also be finite differenced with an implicit scheme , they too require matrix solutions and all zones must be solved concurrently .",
    "the resulting matrices are quite large : without consideration of matrix sparseness , one would need to store @xmath141 numbers , where @xmath142 is the number of species in each zone and @xmath143 is the number of zones . fortunately , however , the resulting matrices are quite sparse since they are block diagonal ( each block is similar in form to that shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sparse ] ) with bands linking adjacent spatial zones .",
    "such large sparse matrices are typically solved by iterative techniques , such as biconjugate gradient which requires only matrix multiplies and , thus , only storage of the non - zero matrix elements .",
    "to date , computation of @xmath144 , @xmath145 problems ( that is , @xmath146 matrices ) can be fairly routinely handled on a single processor .",
    "this approach to solving coupled nucleosynthesis and nuclear mixing is necessary in cases where operator splitting is suspect , and we expect to see it finding greater use in future calculations .      often from a physical understanding one can specialize the general solution method and thereby greatly reduce the computational cost . as an example , we briefly discuss the r - process approximation described in @xcite . for nuclei with @xmath147 ,",
    "charged particle captures ( proton and @xmath47 ) as well as their reverse photodisintegrations virtually cease when @xmath148 .",
    "this leaves only neutron captures and their reverse photodisintegration reactions , as well as @xmath78-decays , which can also lead to the emission of delayed neutrons . in this case , eq .",
    "[ eq : ydot ] greatly simplifies , leaving @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the velocity integrated neutron capture cross section and the photodisintegration rate for the nucleus @xmath152 , while @xmath153 is the decay constant for the @xmath154 decay of @xmath152 , with @xmath1 delayed neutrons ( up to a maximum of j ) .",
    "the assumption is made that the neutron abundance @xmath155 varies slowly enough that it may be evolved explicitly .",
    "one can see that in eq .",
    "[ eq : rproc ] , with @xmath156 thereby fixed , the time derivatives of each species have a linear dependence on only the abundances of their neighbors in the same isotopic chain ( nuclei with the same @xmath157 ) , or that with one less proton @xmath158 .",
    "one can then divide the network into separate pieces for each isotopic chain , and solve them sequentially , beginning with the lowest z. the `` boundary '' terms for this lowest @xmath157 chain can be supplied by a previously run or concurrently running full network calculation which need extend only to this @xmath157 .",
    "this reduces the solution of a matrix with more than a thousand rows to the solution of roughly 30 smaller matrices .",
    "furthermore each of these smaller matrices is also tridiagonal increasing speed further .",
    "freiburghaus  @xcite tested the assumption of slow variation in the neutron abundance and have demonstrated the usefulness of this method in r - process simulations , achieving a large decrease in computational cost .",
    "a similar treatment has been successfully applied to explosive hydrogen burning based on the assumption of slowly varying proton and alpha abundances @xcite . as we will discuss in ",
    "[ sect : hyb ] , for other burning stages there also exist physically motivated simplifications to the general network solution method .",
    "an isolated thermodynamic system tends to evolve towards an equilibrium state , and whether the system reaches that equilibrium depends on the competition between the timescale for equilibration and the other relevant timescales .",
    "for example , the reaction - rate expression found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigv ] ) assumed a local thermal equilibrium in the plasma such that the velocities of the interacting particles are well described by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which is determined by a single parameter , the local temperature .",
    "this is valid because the timescale to achieve this equilibrium is much shorter than the other interaction timescales in the plasma .",
    "similarly , as discussed in ",
    "[ sect : reacrate ] , it is usually assumed in nuclear astrophysics that the internal states of a nucleus are also in equilibrium so that the probability of finding a nucleus in particular excited state is proportional to the boltzmann factor for that state , which , as before , is determined by the temperature and the ( presumably known ) excitation energy of the state .",
    "again this is generally a valid assumption because the transitions within the nucleus are typically much faster than other interactions , although interesting challenges arise when this assumption is not valid ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    at conditions of high temperature and density , the thermonuclear reaction rates themselves may be sufficiently rapid to achieve equilibrium within the timescale set by the hydrodynamics of the astrophysical setting .",
    "this permits considerable simplification of the calculation of the nuclear abundances . in most such cases ,",
    "the fast strong and electromagnetic reactions reach equilibrium while those involving the weak nuclear force do not . since the weak reactions are not equilibrated , the resulting _ nuclear statistical equilibrium _ ( nse )",
    "requires monitoring of weak reaction activity .",
    "even with this stricture , nse offers many advantages , since hundreds of abundances are uniquely defined by the thermodynamic conditions and a single measure of the weak interaction history or the degree of neutronization .",
    "computationally , this reduction in the number of independent variables greatly reduces the cost of nuclear abundance evolution . because there are fewer variables to follow within a hydrodynamic model , the memory footprint of the nuclear abundances is also reduced , an issue of importance in modern multi - dimensional models . finally , the equilibrium abundance calculations depend on binding energies and partition functions , quantities which are better known than many reaction rates .",
    "this is particularly true for unstable nuclei and for conditions where the mass density approaches that of the nucleus itself , resulting in exotic nuclear structures .",
    "the expression for nse is commonly derived using either chemical potentials or detailed balance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for a nucleus @xmath159 , composed of @xmath157 protons and @xmath160 neutrons , in equilibrium with these free nucleons ,",
    "the chemical potential of @xmath159 can be expressed in terms of the chemical potentials of the free nucleons @xmath161 substituting the expression for the boltzmann chemical potential ( including rest mass ) into eq .",
    "[ eq : muaz ] allows derivation of an expression for the abundance of every nuclear species in terms of the abundances of the free protons ( @xmath162 ) and neutrons ( @xmath163 ) , @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the partition function and binding energy of the nucleus @xmath159 , @xmath167 is avagadro s number , @xmath168 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath169 and @xmath18 are the density and temperature of the plasma , and @xmath170 .",
    "abundances of all nuclear species can therefore be expressed as functions of two quantities .",
    "nucleon number conservation @xmath171 provides one constraint .",
    "the second constraint is the amount of weak reaction activity , often expressed in terms of the total proton abundance , @xmath172 , which charge conservation requires equal the electron abundance , @xmath81 .",
    "thus the nuclear abundances are uniquely determined for a given @xmath173 .",
    "alternately , the weak interaction history is sometimes expressed in terms of the neutron excess @xmath174 .",
    "figure  [ fig : abarnse ] displays the temperature and density dependence of @xmath175 , the average nuclear mass of the nse distribution . at high temperatures ,",
    "free nucleons are favored , hence @xmath176 . for intermediate temperatures",

    "density can be seen to scale the placement of these divisions between high , intermediate and low temperature and increase the average mass at low temperature .",
    "variations in @xmath81  do not strongly affect figure  [ fig : abarnse ] . at high temperatures",
    ", it simply effects the ratio of @xmath180 . at low temperatures , variation in @xmath81  changes which fe - peak isotopes dominate .",
    "for example , though @xmath181 is less tightly bound than @xmath182 , it is more tightly bound than @xmath182 + 2 @xmath108 , which would be required by charge conservation if @xmath183",
    ". thus @xmath184 for low @xmath18 with @xmath185 , but @xmath186 for smaller @xmath81 . in general ,",
    "the most abundant nuclei at low temperatures are the most bound nuclei for which @xmath187 .    as with any equilibrium distribution , there are limitations on the applicability of nse . for nse to provide a good estimate of the nuclear abundances",
    "the temperature must be sufficient for the endoergic reaction of each reaction pair to occur .",
    "since for all particle - stable nuclei between the proton and neutron drip lines ( with the exception of nuclei unstable against alpha decay ) , the photodisintegrations are endoergic , with typical q - values among ( @xmath78 ) stable nuclei of 8 - 12 @xmath72 , by eq .",
    "[ eq : detbal ] this requirement reduces to @xmath188 .",
    "while this requirement is necessary , it is not sufficient . in the case of hydrostatic silicon burning , even when this condition is met , appreciable time",
    "is required to convert si to fe - peak elements . in the case of explosive silicon burning ,",
    "the adiabatic cooling on timescales of seconds can cause conditions to change more rapidly than nse can follow , breaking down nse first between @xmath177 and @xmath57 , at @xmath189 @xcite and later between the species near silicon and the fe - peak nuclei , at @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "thus it is clear that in the face of sufficiently rapid thermodynamic variations , nse provides a problematic estimate of abundances .",
    "it is important to note that , in spite of the breakdown of the global nse , many nuclei under these conditions do obey local equilibrium relations with their neighbors .",
    "in spite of the limitations on the applicability of nse , the reduced computational cost provides a strong motivation to maximize the use of equilibria .",
    "the use of equilibrium expressions for single abundances is , in fact , common in nuclear reaction networks , typically to track the abundances of short - lived unstable intermediates in `` three - particle '' processes .",

    ", a number of attempts have been made to take advantage of these partial equilibria ( termed quasi - equilibria or qse ) to reduce the number of independent variables evolved via rate equations and thereby reduce the computational cost of modeling these burning stages . to evolve the abundances of every member of a qse group , it is sufficient to evolve the abundance of any single group member along with the abundances of the free nucleons .",
    "one can thereby reduce the number of abundances that are evolved , while still calculating , from qse relations , the abundances of all members of a qse group and the resultant reaction rates , including the electron and neutrino capture reactions responsible for changes in the neutronization .",
    "the result is a more computationally efficient method that retains the accuracy of the full network and yields abundances for all nuclei found in the full network .",
