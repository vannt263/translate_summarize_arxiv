    "we found cross sections of order 0.1 to 50  pb for the radiative higgs - boson production at the tevatron energy @xmath89tev .",
    "but only for rather light higgs bosons the cross section exceeds 1  pb ; see fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath85  tev to be reached at the lhc we predict large cross sections even for rather heavy higgs bosons .",
    "for instance for higgs - boson masses @xmath90 of about 400  gev we get cross sections exceeding 1  pb . for an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath91 at lhc this corresponds to at least 100,000 higgs bosons being either produced radiatively or being produced and then decaying radiatively . even if one order of magnitude of this number of higgs bosons is lost due to the separation of the signal from the background this is still a sizable number which should be detectable at the lhc .",
    "let us note that recently experimental results for process were published by the d0 collaboration at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "this collaboration observes an excess over the qcd expectation for the cross section @xmath92 for photons with a transverse momentum exceeding 70  gev .",

    "thus , the effect may well go away with further measurements .",
    "but , for the sake of argument , let us take the observed charm jet excess seriously and try to see if it could have anything to to with the mcpm .",
    "the excess cross section @xmath81 which one can deduce from table  i of  @xcite is of the order of 0.02  pb@xmath95gev for @xmath96  70 to 90  gev . comparing with our figs .",
    "[ fign4 ] and [ fign5 ] we see that we find cross sections of this level only for @xmath97 ( 10 )  gev for a higgs - boson mass of 100  ( 200 )  gev .",
    "thus , our calculated cross sections seems too low compared to the findings of  @xcite .",
    "but we have to keep in mind several points before we can draw definite conclusions .",
    "we used different cuts in our calculations compared to the experiments .",
    "we would invite the experimentalists to use our formulas as given in the appendix and to include the processes studied in this paper into their monte carlo programs .",
    "then all their experimental cuts can be implemented appropriately .    in the mcpm",
    "there are also further mechanisms which will contribute to the process  .",
    "we have higher order qcd corrections to the drell  yan production of the higgs bosons , see fig .",
    "[ fig10a ] .",
    "these processes are suppressed by a factor @xmath83 relative to the leading order drell  yan process .",
    "but , clearly , diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10a ] will lead to higgs bosons produced at substantial values of @xmath98 .",
    "then , the radiative decay of these higgs bosons will lead to photons of much higher @xmath82 than from the leading order process .",
    "furthermore there is the possibility of a sort of higgs - strahlung process in @xmath72 collisions .",
    "an example in shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10b ] .",
    "since the coupling of the @xmath2 quark to @xmath6 and @xmath7 is of order 1 the rates for such processes could be quite large .",
    "clearly , for such processes there are the analogous radiative production ones which will also contribute to  .",
    "+ in summary we can say the following concerning the findings of  @xcite .",
    "if the charm excess seen is real and confirmed by further experiments it is not excluded that it may have something to do with higgs - boson production in the mcpm .",
    "our calculations of the cross sections and the @xmath82 distributions for the processes   and must be considered as giving only lower limits for these quantities in the mcpm .",
    "we have identified above various channels which will also contribute but still have to be calculated theoretically .",
    "nonetheless we can say that - at least to us - the magnitude of the effects calculated so far looks interesting for the tevatron experiments .",
