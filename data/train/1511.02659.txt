    "solving an elliptic partial derivative equation under dirichlet or neumann data is a classical problem but trying to impose both dirichlet and neumann data leads to a so called overdetermined elliptic problem ( oep ) and solutions should be very rare .",
    "for example , consider the following problem in a domain ( open and connected ) @xmath8 of @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the unit outward normal vector along @xmath12 .",
    "a domain where the oep   can be solved is called a @xmath13-extremal domain . if @xmath8 is bounded and @xmath14 , serrin  @xcite proved that the ball is the only domain where the above problem admits a solution @xmath3 ( this was generalized later to any lipschitz function @xmath13 ) .",
    "the proof of serrin uses the moving plane method that was introduced by alexandrov in @xcite in order to prove that round spheres are the only constant mean curvature embedded hypersurfaces in @xmath9 .    in @xcite , berestycki , caffarelli and nirenberg",
    "considered the above problem for unbounded domains in @xmath9 and proved that , under some additional hypotheses on @xmath13 , the only @xmath13-extremal domain that is an epigraph is a halfspace .",
    "moreover , they stated the following conjecture .    * bcn conjecture . * if @xmath13 is lipschitz , and @xmath8 is a smooth connected domain with @xmath15 connected where the oep   admits a bounded solution , then @xmath8 is either a ball , a halfspace , a cylinder @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is a ball of @xmath18 or the complement of one of them .",
    "this conjecture is also motivated by the work of reichel  @xcite concerning exterior domains .",
    "besides it has inspired many interesting results : for example , the works of farina and valdinoci  @xcite about epigraphs or the one of ros and sicbaldi  @xcite concerning planar domains . actually , in @xcite , sicbaldi gave a counterexample to bcn conjecture in @xmath9 for @xmath19 .",
    "but understanding the geometry of @xmath13-extremal domains is still an interesting question and one of the main point is the similarity of the geometry of these domains with the one of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces . exploiting this similarity , ros , ruiz and sicbaldi @xcite proved that in dimension",
    "@xmath20 the bcn conjecture is true for unbounded domains whose complement is unbounded : it has to be a halfplane .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for the study of overdetermined elliptic problems on a complete , non - compact riemannian manifold without boundary and with non - negative ricci tensor .    in this paper , we are interested in the geometry of @xmath13-extremal unbounded domains in the hyperbolic space .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath21 be a domain ( open and connected ) whose boundary , if not empty , is of class @xmath2 and consider the following oep @xmath22where @xmath23 is the inner product on @xmath0 induced by the hyperbolic metric , @xmath24 the hyperbolic distance , @xmath25 the unit outward normal vector along the boundary @xmath26 ( we will also use the notation @xmath27 for @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 a non - positive constant .",
    "the function @xmath13 will be subject to the following assumptions : @xmath30 hypothesis   corresponds to the one in the bcn conjecture and is made all along the paper so it would not be mentioned in the statements of the results .",
    "concerning hypothesis  , it will not be assumed in some results of section  [ sec : dim2 ] , so we will precise when it is assumed .",
    "the study of @xmath13-extremal domains in @xmath0 already appears in the work of espinar and mao  @xcite .",
    "they use the fact that the hyperbolic space can be compactified by its ideal boundary @xmath31 ; so @xmath13-extremal domains can be studied in terms of their trace on @xmath32 , one of their results states that a @xmath13-extremal domain whose trace on @xmath31 is at most one point is either a geodesic ball or a horoball ( hypothesis   is not need in this result ) , this generalizes , to any @xmath13 , results by molzon  @xcite and sa earp and toubiana  @xcite .    here , our study looks at @xmath13-extremal domains whose trace on @xmath31 is larger , for example we prove that a @xmath13-extremal domain whose complement is bounded is the complement of a geodesic ball .",
    "this result is similar to the one of reichel  @xcite in the euclidean case .",
    "we also give a characterization of the complement of a horoball .",
    "we also prove that if the trace on @xmath31 of @xmath12 ( with @xmath8 is a @xmath13-extremal domains ) is some asymptotic equator ( see section  [ sec : hypgeo ] for a precise definition ) then @xmath8 has to be invariant by a big subgroup of hyperbolic isometries .",
    "this result can be compared with the result of berestycki , caffarelli and nirenberg concerning epigraphs .    as mentioned above",
    ", the geometry of @xmath13-extremal domains seems to imitate the geometry of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces .",
    "so it is interesting to compare our results with the ones obtained by do  carmo and lawson in  @xcite and levitt and rosenberg in @xcite where constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in @xmath0 are characterized by their trace on @xmath31 .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : hypgeo ] , we recall some aspects of hyperbolic geometry and fix some notations used in the following sections .",
    "section  [ sec : mpm ] is devoted to the study of exterior domains . in section  [ sec : inv ] , we prove a result concerning the invariance by hyperbolic translations of @xmath13-extremal domains . in the last section , we study @xmath13 extremal domains @xmath8 in @xmath33 without hypothesis  , the main point is to understand the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath12 when it is connected .",
    "in this section , we will give an exposition of some aspects of the hyperbolic space for the reader convenience .",
    "the hyperbolic space @xmath0 ( @xmath34 ) is ( up to isometry ) the only simply connected manifold of constant sectional curvature @xmath35 .",
    "it is well known that the cut locus of any point on @xmath0 is empty , which implies that for any two points on @xmath0 there is a unique geodesic joining them .",
    "therefore , the concept of geodesic convexity can be naturally defined for subsets of @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 is an element of the unit tangent bundle @xmath38 , we define the half geodesic starting from @xmath39 with initial speed @xmath40 as the geodesic @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we say that two half geodesics @xmath44 and @xmath45 are _ asymptotic _ if there exists a constant @xmath46 such that the distance @xmath47 is less than @xmath46 for all @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , two unit vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 are asymptotic if the corresponding geodesics @xmath51 , @xmath52 have this property .",
    "it is easy to find that being asymptotic is an equivalence relation on the set of unit - speed half geodesics or on the set of unit vectors on @xmath0 .",
    "each equivalence class is called a point at infinity .",
    "denote by @xmath53 the set of points at infinity , and denote by @xmath54 or @xmath55 the equivalence class of the corresponding geodesic @xmath56 or unit vector @xmath40 .",
    "it is called the end - point of @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath58 is a unit speed geodesic line , we denote by @xmath59 the equivalence class of @xmath60 .",
    "it is well - known that for two asymptotic half geodesics @xmath44 and @xmath45 in @xmath0 , the distances @xmath61 and @xmath62 goes to zero as @xmath63 . besides , for any @xmath64 , there exists a unique oriented unit speed geodesic @xmath57 such that @xmath65 and @xmath66 ; this geodesic will be denoted by @xmath67 .    for any point @xmath68",
    ", there exists a bijective correspondence between unit vectors at @xmath39 and @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , for a point @xmath68 and a point @xmath69 , there exists a unique oriented unit speed geodesic @xmath57 such that @xmath70 and @xmath65 .",
    "equivalently , the unit vector @xmath40 at the point @xmath39 is mapped to the point at infinity @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 is bijective to a unit sphere , i.e. , @xmath72 . for @xmath73 and @xmath74 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath75 the half geodesic starting at @xmath39 with end - point @xmath76 .",
    "set @xmath77 . for a point @xmath68 , @xmath78 an open subset of the unit sphere of the tangent space @xmath79 and @xmath80 , define @xmath81 then there is a unique topology @xmath82 on @xmath83 with the following properties : open subsets of @xmath0 are open subsets of @xmath82 and the sets @xmath84 containing a point @xmath85 form an open neighborhood basis at @xmath76 .",
    "this topology is called the _ ideal topology _ of @xmath83 .",
    "clearly , the ideal topology @xmath82 satisfies the following properties :    ( a1 ) @xmath86 coincides with the topology induced by the riemannian distance ;    ( a2 ) for any @xmath68 and any homeomorphism @xmath87\\rightarrow[0,+\\infty]$ ] , the function @xmath88 , from the closed unit ball of @xmath79 to @xmath83 , given by @xmath89 is a homeomorphism .",
    "moreover , @xmath88 identifies @xmath71 with the unit sphere ;    ( a3 ) for a point @xmath68 , the mapping @xmath90 is a homeomorphism from the unit sphere of @xmath79 onto @xmath71 .",
    "( a4 ) with this topology , @xmath83 is a compactification of @xmath0 @xcite .    using this topology",
    ", one can define the boundary at infinity of a subset @xmath91 of @xmath0 .",
    "actually , we denote @xmath92 the closure in @xmath83 with the ideal topology .",
    "then @xmath93 denotes the boundary at infinity of @xmath91 , that is , @xmath94 .",
    "also , denote by @xmath95 the interior of a given set of points .",
    "there are several models for the hyperbolic space . among them",
    ", the poincar ball model is very interesting to visualize the hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the poincar ball model is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the euclidean unit ball in @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the poincar metric , which is given at a point @xmath100 by @xmath101here @xmath102 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "it is well known that , in this model , the compactification @xmath103 identified with the closed unit ball and its ideal boundary corresponds to @xmath104    in this model , the geodesics are circle arcs ( or segment ) in @xmath105 orthogonal to @xmath106 . as a consequence ,",
    "totally geodesic submanifolds are given by spherical caps ( or planar caps ) meeting orthogonally the boundary of @xmath107 .",
    "actually , more generally , totally umbilical submanifolds of @xmath0 are given by the intersection of totally umbilical submanifolds in @xmath9 with @xmath107 .",
    "for example , one can observe that for any point @xmath108 there exists a unique sphere @xmath109 , whose radius is given by @xmath110 , that meet orthogonally @xmath111 .",
    "hence , @xmath112 is a totally geodesic hyperplane .",
    "from , one can see that the isometry group of @xmath0 is given by the group of conformal transformations of @xmath9 that preserves @xmath113 .",
    "in particular , linear isometries are isometries of the model .",
    "euclidean reflections through hyperplanes containing the origin or inversions through spheres meeting orthogonally the boundary of @xmath113 are then reflections with respect to totally geodesic hyperplanes .    before we continue , let us recall the relation between isometries of the hyperbolic space @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and conformal diffeomorphisms on the sphere at infinity @xmath116 , @xmath117 . using the poincar ball model ,",
    "an isometry @xmath118 induces a unique conformal diffeomorphism @xmath119 ; actually this map is bijective .",
    "another useful model is the halfspace model : it is @xmath120 endowed with the metric @xmath121    let @xmath122 then the map @xmath123 is conformal and realizes a bijection from @xmath107 onto @xmath120 .",
    "actually @xmath124 is an isometry between the poincar ball model and the halfspace model .",
    "so properties of this model can be deduced from the preceding one using @xmath124 .",
    "for example , the ideal boundary @xmath32 is identified with @xmath125 where @xmath126 is some point added in order to compactify @xmath127 . @xmath126",
    "correspond to @xmath128 through @xmath124 .",
    "a totally geodesic hyperplane can be characterized by its boundary at infinity .",
    "if @xmath129 is such a totally geodesic hyperplane , the set @xmath130 is called an asymptotic equator and for any asymptotic equator @xmath131 there is a unique totally geodesic hyperplane @xmath129 with @xmath132 .    in the poincar ball model ,",
    "the asymptotic equators are the hyperspheres of @xmath133 : that is , given any point @xmath134 and radius @xmath135 , the submanifold @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the geodesic ball in @xmath116 centered at @xmath76 of radius @xmath138 .",
    "in particular , a classical equator centered at @xmath76 , @xmath139 , appearing when @xmath140 is an asymptotic equator .",
    "when @xmath76 is the north pole @xmath141 , the hyperplane @xmath129 associated to @xmath139 is given by @xmath142    the equidistant hypersurfaces at distance @xmath46 to some totally geodesic hyperplane @xmath129 are given by @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the exponential map in @xmath0 and @xmath145 is the unit normal along @xmath129 .",
    "each @xmath146 is totally umbilic with constant principal curvatures @xmath147 , that is , @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 denote the first and second fundamental form respectively . here the orientation for @xmath146 is the one given to be coherent with the normal @xmath145 on @xmath151 .",
    "actually , these equidistant hypersurfaces are the umbilic hypersurfaces of @xmath0 with principal curvatures in the interval @xmath152 .",
    "since @xmath146 is at a bounded distance from @xmath129 , it implies that @xmath153 .",
    "now , based on the above brief introduction , we can define busemann functions and then horospheres . given a unit vector @xmath154 in @xmath155 ,",
    "let @xmath156 be the oriented geodesic on @xmath0 satisfying @xmath157 , then the busemann function @xmath158 , associated to @xmath40 , is defined by @xmath159    it is not difficult to see that this function has the following properties ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    ( b1 ) @xmath160 is a @xmath2 convex function on @xmath0 ;    ( b2 ) the gradient @xmath161 is the unique unit vector @xmath162 at @xmath39 such that @xmath163 ;    ( b3 ) if @xmath164 is a unit vector such that @xmath163 , then @xmath165 is a constant function on @xmath0 .",
    "given a unit vector @xmath40 in @xmath166 , denote by @xmath76 the point @xmath167 .",
    "the horospheres based or centered at @xmath76 are defined to be the _ level sets _ of the busemann function @xmath160 . by ( b3 ) , the horospheres at @xmath76 do not depend on the choice of @xmath40 .",
    "the horoballs based at @xmath76 are defined to be the _ sublevel sets _ of the busemann function : @xmath168 .",
    "the horospheres at @xmath76 give a foliation of @xmath0 , and by ( b1 ) , we know that each element of this foliation bounds a convex domain in @xmath0 which is a horoball . by ( b2 ) , the intersection between a geodesic @xmath57 and a horosphere based at @xmath54 is always orthogonal .",
    "the horospheres are the umbilic hypersurfaces of @xmath0 with constant principal curvatures equal to @xmath169 or @xmath35 depending one the choice of orientation .",
    "moreover , the induced metric on each horosphere is flat so they are isometric to @xmath170",
    ".    in the poincar ball model , horospheres at @xmath171 are given by spheres internally tangent to @xmath172 at @xmath76 .",
    "the tangency point @xmath76 is the unique point at infinity of the horosphere .    in the halfspace model ,",
    "the horosphere based at @xmath126 are the horizontal hyperplanes @xmath173 for @xmath174 .      here",
    ", we will recall some important properties of the isometry group of @xmath0 .",
    "we already know that this group acts as the group of conformal transformations of @xmath9 that preserves @xmath107 .",
    "so one important fact is that @xmath175 acts simply transitively on the space of orthonormal bases of @xmath166 ; more precisely , if @xmath176 and @xmath177 are orthonormal bases of @xmath178 and @xmath179 respectively , then there is one and only one isometry of @xmath0 sending @xmath39 to @xmath180 and @xmath176 to @xmath177 .",
    "this property tells that , in a model , we can often assume that we are in some standard position .",
    "for example , if @xmath129 is a totally geodesic hyperplane , we can assume that it is @xmath181 in the poincar ball model .",
    "let @xmath129 be a totally geodesic hyperplane of @xmath182 with unit normal @xmath145 .",

    "it is important to remark that the group @xmath115 is generated by reflections .",
    "let @xmath4 be a ( bounded or unbounded ) connected domain in @xmath0 and @xmath187 be the reflection through @xmath129 .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the geometry and the topology of unbounded domains in the hyperbolic space @xmath0 supporting a bounded positive solution to an overdetermined elliptic problem .    under suitable conditions on the elliptic problem and the behaviour of the bounded solution at infinity , we are able to show that symmetries of the boundary at infinity imply symmetries on the domain itself .    in dimension two , we can strengthen our results proving that a connected domain @xmath1 with @xmath2 boundary whose complement is connected and supports a bounded positive solution @xmath3 to an overdetermined problem , assuming natural conditions on the equation and the behaviour at infinity of the solution , must be either a geodesic ball or , a horodisk or , a half - space determined by a complete equidistant curve or , the complement of any of the above example . </S>",
