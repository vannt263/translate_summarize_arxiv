    "the study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has received an exceptional boost thanks to the _ swift _ mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) , which has enabled rapid follow - up radio to x - ray observations of grbs .",
    "however , despite a very large number of such fast follow - up observations performed by this spacecraft and by ground observatories , the characteristics of the  central engine \" that produces the grb are still unclear . the prevailing model ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen 1999 , 2001 ; thompson 2007 ) predicts the formation of a compact object , either a black hole or a magnetar , surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "the compact object is the result of the core collapse of a very massive star or the final merger of two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) or ns - black hole binary . under the correct conditions of angular momentum and magnetic field ,",
    "such a system would launch a collimated , ultra - relativistic jet ( e.g. via the blanford - znajek mechanism ; blandford & znajek 1977 ) . within these jets , one or more",
    " internal dissipation \" processes take place ( for a review , see zhang 2011 ) , converting part of the kinetic and/or magnetic energy into radiation",
    ". a burst of gamma - rays will then be visible if the observer is placed within the opening angle of the outflow .    following the prompt gamma - ray emission , long - lived afterglow emission",
    "is detected in several energy bands ( radio , optical , x - ray and probably high - energy gamma - rays ) .",
    "the consensus is that the afterglow radiation is emitted when ultra - relativistic ejecta interact with the circumburst medium , driving a forward shock ( fs ) , which moves into the medium , and a reverse shock ( rs ) , which propagates backwards through the ejecta . in particular , the emission due to the fs can in principle last indefinitely .",
    "a hallmark of rs and fs afterglow emission is that the flux density @xmath4 behaves as a power - law both in time and frequency , being described as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the time from the grb trigger ( kobayashi & zhang 2007 ) and @xmath7 is the frequency .",
    "+ however , _ swift _ observations have produced evidence of more complex phenomena during the afterglow phase , such as x - ray and optical flares ( falcone et al .",
    "2006 ; margutti et al 2011 ; swenson et al . 2013 ) , that can not be attributed to the fs due to their fast temporal variability .",
    "for a few kiloseconds ( ks ) after the trigger , the afterglow flux often decays in a slow fashion ( phase ii of the canonical xrt light - curve , also known as  plateau \" ; o  brien et al . 2006 , nousek et al . 2006 ; racusin et al . 2009",
    "; margutti et al . 2010 ) which can not be understood if the fireball follows an adiabatic evolution ; a process of energy injection ( zhang et al . 2006 ) into the fireball is usually invoked to explain such a feature .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that the grb central engine is still active , and produces energy and/or a relativistic outflow .    in a small subset of _ swift _ grb afterglows , observations",
    "have shown slow decline phases of the x - ray flux which terminate with an abrupt fall in the emission , with slopes @xmath8 , sometimes approaching @xmath9 ( troja et al .",
    "2007 , liang et al .",
    "2007 , lyons et al .",
    "2010 , rowlinson et al . 2013 ; l & zhang 2014 ) .",
    "again , the fs model does not predict such behaviour . instead",
    ", such steep decay can be expected when the central engine is a newly born magnetar , which emits a very high luminosity outflow due to the spin - down process ( usov 1992 , zhang & meszaros 2001 , zhang & meszaros 2002 , dallosso et al .",
    "2011 ) , which in turn produces emission we can directly observe in the x - ray .",
    "a very energetic outflow could also be produced by a newly formed stellar mass black hole surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "the electromagnetic luminosity is expected to fall rapidly after the time - scale @xmath10 of the spin - down process , if the magnetar collapses into a black hole , or accretion onto the black hole stops .",
    "the outflow produced by the spin - down process should generate emission via the synchrotron process .",
    "this kind of emission seems to be produced mostly in the x - ray band , while it is not usually detected at lower frequencies such as the optical ( see troja et al .",
    "2007 , zhang et al .",
    "2009 , rowlinson et al . 2013",
    "; however see cano et al .",
    "2014 for grb130215a ) , perhaps because the optical band is at or below the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ( zhang 2009 ; see also shen & zhang 2009 ) . at low frequencies",
    ", the dominant emission mechanism seems to be the standard fs , with its power - law decays and slow flux variations .",
    "fs emission , however , is still expected to be present even in the x - ray band , and it should emerge once the x - ray emission from the outflow produced by the magnetar or the black hole drops . so far ,",
    "this has been seen clearly in the case of the long grb 070110 ( troja et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this event , the x - ray light - curve showed a plateau lasting for  20 ks , after which the flux fell quickly with a slope of @xmath11 , and then resumed a power - law decay with a much shallower slope of @xmath12 .",
    "such a late slope appears in most grb afterglows and is likely produced by the fs .    in this paper , we present the well - sampled x - ray , uv / optical and nir observations of the afterglow of grb 130831a , and show that its behaviour can be interpreted as a superposition of fs emission and  internal emission \" , the latter of which suddenly ceases at @xmath13  ks .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we present the observations taken by different instruments and observing facilities , and show how the data were reduced and analyzed .",
    "we recall the results of the observations taken by other groups on grb130831a as well . in sect .",

    "( 2008 ) , before translating to flux densities .",

    "duffell & macfadyen ( 2014 ) explored the possibility that the plateaux we see in grb afterglows are produced by a jetted outflow before deceleration , followed by a steeper decay , which flags the blandford & mckee deceleration of the ejecta .",
    "however , such a decay in their model does not reach a value as steep as @xmath227 detected in grb 130831a between 100 and 200  ks .    by assuming that the steep decay is due to the curvature effect ( kumar & panaitescu 2000",
    "; see also uhm & zhang 2014 ) , we followed liang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to test the internal origin of x - ray emission up to the steep break .",
    "we found that to satisfy the @xmath228 condition of the curvature effect , the zero time @xmath229 of this emission needs to be @xmath230 ks after the trigger , slightly before the beginning of the flux drop . the very steep decay component",
    "therefore strongly suggests that the x - ray emission up to 100 ks is of internal origin , since @xmath229 is allowed to occur at large time intervals from the initial prompt emission in this case ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; liang et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in a more general study of the curvature effect emission ( uhm & zhang 2014 ) , the emitting ejecta are assumed to accelerate or decelerate while producing the radiation .",
    "if the ejecta are accelerating , which may be the case for the magnetically dominated jet of the icmart model ( zhang & yan 2011 ) , the decay index may temporarily reach a value of @xmath231 we observe even assuming @xmath229 as the trigger of the prompt emission and @xmath232 .",
    "a magnetically dominated jet thus appears to be a reasonable solution for the grb at hand .",
    "however , whichever solution applies , one would always have to assume that the emission is produced inside the ejecta and not in the medium surrounding the explosion as in the case of the fs scenario .",
    "finally , in the previous section we made it clear that the final part of the x - ray light - curve , after the end of the steep decay , appears to be fs emission .    _ we conclude that the x - ray emission up to the 100  ks break is not produced by the external , circumburst medium energized by the fs , but it is instead of  internal origin \" , generated directly within the explosion outflow .",
    "this component stops abruptly and the x - ray flux drops rapidly , until the fs emission in the x - ray band prevails . _",

    ", we shall discuss the possible origins of the high - energy emission between the end of the prompt emission and the fall of the x - ray flux at 100  ks .",
    "the nature of the x - ray afterglow and the nature of the central engine are two of the many open questions in the contemporary field of grbs ( see zhang 2011 for a review ) , even more so because this grb shows that we may be misinterpreting the behaviour of other x - ray light - curves solely or primarily attributed to fs .",
    "for example , if we had not observed the steep drop at 100  ks for 130831a , we might have easily mistaken the relatively ordinary decay and spectral slopes as being produced by the standard fs - emission .",
    "the core of the stellar progenitor of grb 130831a may have collapsed into a magnetar ( see for example thompson et al .",
    "the rotational kinetic energy @xmath233 of such objects is    @xmath234    where @xmath235 , @xmath59 and @xmath236 are the mass , radius and period in ms of the object , respectively . assuming unitary values for the parameters above , @xmath237 erg , which is enough to power the supernova explosion and ultra - relativistic outflow .",
    "if the mass m is closer to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff limit , which is thought to be slightly larger than @xmath238 ( antoniadis et al .",
    "2013 ) , the parameter @xmath239 might be slightly different ( metzger et al . 2015 ) .    in a simple scenario ,",
    "the magnetar would initially tap into rotational energy and produce a very energetic outflow , likely roughly collimated into bi - polar jets .",
    "such a wind would be produced through the process of dipole spin - down .",
    "the energy of the outflow is initially imparted to the stellar envelope , causing , or at least contributing to , the supernova explosion . moreover , the magnetar outflow may be long - lived , and produce radiation that we observe ( see below ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the luminosity @xmath240 of the magnetar could be roughly constant , even for a relatively long timescale @xmath10 ( zhang & mszros 2002 ) , depending on physical parameters .",
    "after @xmath10 , or if the magnetar collapses into a black hole , the light - curve would show a flux drop . this magnetar model is relevant for a few grbs that show a plateau with approximately constant flux , with @xmath241 , followed by the steep slope segment ( see cases studied by liang et al .",
    "2007 , l & zhang 2014 , cano et al .",
    "2014 , bernardini et al .",
    "2014 , l et al .",
    "2015 ) . however , the early decay slope of 130831a is @xmath242 , which is in contrast to the aforementioned cases , and requires a more complicated model to explain our observations .",
    "+      in the simple spin - down calculation above , one assumes that the magnetic field @xmath60 is constant and independent of the period of the magnetar @xmath236 .",
    "metzger et al . ( 2011 ) , however , assume that @xmath60 is linked to @xmath236 , taking into account that the magnetic field is generated from the energy available in differential rotation .",
    "they thus estimate @xmath243    under this assumption , @xmath60 decreases with increasing @xmath236 , i.e. , with increasing time since the explosion . in such conditions , the jet luminosity @xmath244 is not constant . as shown in figures 2 and 5 of metzger et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , @xmath244 decreases with time , scaling approximately as @xmath245 from 1001000 s to tens of ks after the collapse for reasonable values of parameters at the beginning of the spin - down , such as @xmath246 g and @xmath247  ms . the predicted luminosity of the jet seems to be in the right range to explain the x - ray emission of grb 130831a during the slow decay phase , too .",
    "for the values quoted above , metzger et al .",
    "( 2011 ) predict a few @xmath248 erg s@xmath18 at 10 ks ; at the same epoch , grb 130831a had a luminosity of @xmath249 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "we note that a jet luminosity @xmath250 does not convert immediately into x - ray luminosity @xmath251 ; one has to take into account that the radiation mechanism will have a certain efficiency .",
    "moreover , we have not yet considered that grb emission is beamed .",
    "we can write @xmath252    where @xmath253 and @xmath254 are the efficiency in converting the jet luminosity into x - ray radiation and the correction for the beaming , respectively .    according to metzger et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , at late epochs ( @xmath255  s after the collapse ) , the magnetar outflow is highly relativistic and poynting - flux dominated ; in such conditions , internal shocks and reconnections within the jet itself are not possible .",
    "forced reconnection , however , can occur at large radii , when the outflow collides with the circumburst medium and/or the previous ejecta , and convert the jet energy into x - ray emission .",
    "assuming that the efficiency of this process is similar to the one which generates the prompt emission , and the correction for beaming is 10 times lower than that during the prompt emission , metzger et al .",
    "( 2011 ) find that they can explain the observed @xmath251 and plateau durations of several grbs similar to grb 130831a .",
    "the newly born magnetar may also provide a large energy input in the exploding progenitor , powering an energetic and luminous supernova explosion .",
    "this is in agreement with observations of cano et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who find a kinetic energy for the ( non - relativistic ) ejecta of sn 2013fu of @xmath256 erg and a peak absolute magnitude @xmath257 .",
    "we note that greiner et al .",
    "2015 found @xmath258 erg for sn2011  kl , a very bright supernova associated with grb 111209a , whose properties can be explained by the energy injection of a newly born magnetar .",
    "in addition , the energetics of sn2013fu is quite typical of other sne associated with grbs ( cano et al .",
    "2015 ) .    as for the abrupt end of the x - ray emission of  internal origin \" , with a very steep slope , we may attribute it to the delayed collapse of the magnetar into a black hole ( vietri & stella 1998 , lyons et al .",
    "2010 , rowlinson et al .",
    "once the magnetar has lost much of its rotational energy to power the jet , the weakened centrifugal forces may not be able to avoid the collapse .",
    "the timescale of such event , for a neutron star mass of @xmath259 , initial period of @xmath260 s and magnetic field of @xmath261 gauss would be @xmath262  s ( vietri & stella 1998 , their eq .",
    "1 ) , comparable to the epoch of the steep drop in the x - ray light curve of grb 130831a . such a collapse should be relatively quick , and rapidly stop energy emission from the central object .",
    "if a magnetar collapsing into a black - hole is the right model , grb  130831a might be a candidate for the production of fast - radio bursts ( frbs ) , as described in zhang ( 2014 ) , as thus a target for observational campaigns in radio aimed at understanding the origin of frbs .",
    "another possibility we consider is that the central engine of this grb could be a stellar black hole with a fall - back accretion disk ( kumar et al .",
    "2008 ) . basically , in the supernova explosion associated with the grb , the innermost part of the star collapses into a black hole",
    "a continued fall - back of matter - directly from the progenitor envelope or from supernova ejecta that failed to reach escape velocity - occurs at the centre .",
    "some of this material does not accrete directly onto the black hole , but creates an accretion disk around it . depending on the fall - back rate and the accretion time @xmath263 onto the black hole",
    ", the material of this disk can power relativistic ejecta from the black hole for a long time , which may produce both the prompt emission and a long - lived , slowly decaying x - ray flux .    for the latter , kumar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) envisage a few possibilities .",
    "one is that the accreting disk has a low viscosity .",
    "it will thus take a long time , of the order of @xmath264  s , for the all the disk material to accrete onto the black hole and power the jet .",
    "this model explains a long - lived plateau , but it predicts a flux decay with slope @xmath265 at the end of this phase , which is not observed in grb 130831a and other grbs with similar features .",
    "another possibility is that the disk has high viscosity .",
    "then @xmath263 is much less than the fall - back time , and the emission basically traces the rate of the matter falling back onto the accretion disk .",
    "however , such a scenario can not explain why the fall - back rate is less steep than expected : on theoretical grounds , we expect a fall - back rate to vary as @xmath266 ( chevalier 1989 ) .",
    "secondly , the plateau slope and the sudden cut - off can be explained only by a particular density and angular momentum profile of the matter of the progenitor .",
    "a luminosity that evolves close to @xmath267 , as in the case of grb 130831a , might be explained if the density profile of the stellar envelope has a profile of approximately @xmath268 , where @xmath50 is the radius from the centre of the star .",
    "a steep drop at the end of the plateau might be achieved if the material of the stellar envelope , which is the last to be accreted , has a relatively small angular momentum : this will cause the matter to fall rapidly onto the black hole and shut off the emission . such a peculiar configuration , however , seems somewhat contrived and at odds with models of stellar progenitors ( e.g. woosley et al .",
    "moreover , to support accretion for @xmath269  s , the disk should be unusually large and massive , leaving little mass for ejecta .",
    "cano et al . (",
    "2014 ) find instead that the sn  2013fu , associated with grb 130831a , has an ejecta mass of @xmath270 @xmath271 , which is typical of other grb - sne ( e.g. cano 2013 ) .    for the model discussed",
    ", the jet luminosity is expected to be in the range of @xmath272 erg s@xmath18 at the end of the plateau , which is similar to the x - ray luminosity of the grb 130831a afterglow at the end of the shallow decline phase .",
    "barkov & komissarov ( 2010 ) conceive another scenario in which a black hole might power a grb and long - lived outflow ( see also komissarov & barkov , 2009 ) . if a compact object and a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star form a very close binary , such a system can go through a common envelope phase in which the compact object spirals in and can accrete the matter of the companion .",
    "the common envelope matter will have very high angular momentum and can take a long time to accrete . according to barkov & kommisarov ,",
    "the accretion timescale of such a system is :    @xmath273    where @xmath274 represents the viscosity , @xmath275 and @xmath276 the radius and mass of the wr star , and @xmath277 is the mass of the compact object . for massive compact objects ,",
    "an accretion timescale of several tens of ks is not impossible is valid if @xmath277 is considerably smaller than @xmath276 .",
    "however , if they become comparable , e.g. when we have a black hole of 10 @xmath271 and wolf - rayet star of similar mass , one has to find a different method to estimate @xmath278 . ] . according to barkov & kommisarov ( 2010 ) ,",
    "during accretion the compact object will produce jets via the blandford - znajek mechanism , and the jet luminosity will be in the range of @xmath279 erg s@xmath18 , more than enough to explain the luminosity during the slow decline phase .",
    "nonetheless , this scenario might suffer from the same problems as the previous one .",
    "if the viscosity of the accretion disc is low , which is required to keep the material around the black hole for @xmath280  day , then the flux should not decrease quickly at the end of the plateau .",
    "the binary origin scenario could not reproduce the steep x - ray flux drop and/or it would require a peculiar structure of the wr star to explain the temporal dependence of the luminosity .",
    "we note , however , that in their papers , barkov and kommissarov do not discuss what happens at the end of the plateau , so we can only postulate .",
    "finally , we remark that this binary origin model can predict a supernova , like the one associated with grb 130831a .",
    "we have shown that the fs scenario ( or any refreshed shock scenario ) can not explain the x - ray emission of grb 130831a between the end of prompt emission and @xmath13  ks , since such a model can not entail the steep decay of the flux at that epoch .",
    "we have investigated whether such early x - ray emission can be attributed to dissipation processes occurring in the outflow of a newly born magnetar , produced via spin - down energy extraction of the compact object .",
    "we have found that the simplest model can not explain the observations , because it predicts a flat x - ray light - curve followed by a steep drop . in the case of grb 130831a ,",
    "the decay slope before the break is @xmath281 , which is much steeper than what we expect in this model .",
    "however , a more elaborate model of the magnetar spin - down , in which the magnetic field is expected to decay as the rotation time increases , predicts a luminosity decay more consistent with observations and a duration that can extend up to tens of ks .",
    "moreover , the anticipated x - ray luminosity is in the right range .",
    "the assumed initial parameters - initial period @xmath236 and magnetic field @xmath60 - for the newly born magnetar that would produce such a x - ray light - curve are @xmath282  ms and @xmath283 g , which are expected on theoretical grounds for such an object .",
    "we have also discussed whether the compact object could be a black hole rather than a magnetar . in order to power emission for such a long time , the black hole should be surrounded by an extended disk , perhaps produced by fall - back material of the supernova associated with the grb .",
    "while this model still may predict the right luminosity and duration for the  internal \" x - ray emission , it would require an anomalous distribution of angular momentum in the progenitor star , and peculiar fall - back rates .",
    "similar advantages and disadvantages may be present in a model in which the compact object forms a binary with a wr star and spirals in , blowing up the star into a massive disk .",
    "all in all , we deem the magnetar model with a decaying magnetic field the most plausible of those presented so far to explain the properties of grb 130831a .",
    "in the cosmological rest frame , the x - ray internal emission begins no later than @xmath284  s and lasts until @xmath285  s. taking into account cosmological corrections , the 0.310 kev luminosity at 135 s is @xmath286  erg s@xmath18 ; we assume that from this epoch the luminosity decreases as @xmath287 up to 66.4  ks .",
    "we subtract the amount of x - ray emission produced by the fs ( see section [ early ] ) , and we obtain a total energy @xmath288 erg . such a value represents @xmath289 of the energy emitted during the prompt phase , and only @xmath290 of the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta producing the fs emission .",
    "we note , however , that the internal emission may extend below 0.3 kev and above 10 kev .",
    "thus , @xmath291 and the percentage we have determined represent a lower limit . +      we know that the kinetic energy of the ejecta of sn 2013fu , the supernova associated with grb 130831a , is @xmath292 erg ( cano et al .",
    "this is a factor @xmath293 lower than the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta and comparable to the energy emitted during the prompt emission , and @xmath294 times higher than the energy associated with the x - ray emission of  internal origin \" .",
    "we do caution , however , that the estimated sn kinetic energy is _ isotropic _ , while the energy of the relativistic ejecta , the prompt and the early x - ray energetics must be corrected for an unknown beaming factor .",
    "grb 130831a does not show the signature of a jet break ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) within our observations , so we can not derive the beaming angle @xmath295 of the ejecta and thus the beaming factor .",
    "however , we can set limits .",
    "the detection of the x - ray afterglow by _ chandra _ at 1430 ks",
    "after the trigger indicates that the fs x - ray afterglow had a decay slope of @xmath3 up to that epoch and no jet break had yet occurred .",
    "+ following zhang et al .",
    "2009 , the beaming angle of the ejecta in a medium with constant density can be estimated as    @xmath296    where @xmath297 is the jet break time in days . our first _",
    "observation took place 16.6 days after the trigger and we adopt the values @xmath178 and @xmath181 determined from our modeling ; we note that the exact value of @xmath295 depends only weakly on the value of these parameters anyway .",
    "we infer that @xmath298  rad ; thus the lower limit on the beaming factor is @xmath299 . by definition ,",
    "the maximum value for the beaming factor is @xmath300 when the source is isotropic .",
    "+ if the beaming factor of grb 130831a emission were @xmath301 , the total energy budget of this event and its supernova would be @xmath302 erg .",
    "the prompt energy @xmath214 , the energy emitted in x - rays up to 100 ks @xmath291 , and the kinetic energy @xmath303 of the relativistic ejecta would be @xmath304 , @xmath305 and @xmath306 of the total energy budget . if , as an extreme and unlikely case , grb 130831a were isotropic , its total energy budget would be @xmath307 erg ; the above percentages would become @xmath308 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta is _ at least _",
    "@xmath306 of the total energy produced by the grb and the sn . moreover , the fraction of energy going into the  internal emission \" x - rays is always rather small , being substantially less than @xmath311 in both cases .",
    "+ if grb 130831a and its sn are powered by a magnetar , the total energy budget can not be @xmath312 erg ( see section [ origin ] ) . to not exceed this limit , the beaming factor of the grb",
    "must be @xmath313 .",
    "if @xmath314 , @xmath214 , @xmath291 , and @xmath303 represent @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath317 of the total energy . in reality , we should expect these percentages to be between those of the @xmath314 and  @xmath318 cases if grb 130831a is actually powered by a magnetar .",
    "the breakdown is presented again in table [ breakdown ] .      in our analysis , we have focused on the afterglow emission between 15 and 230 ks .",
    "it is worth exploring whether our model can explain the interesting features of the early afterglow , especially the optical band .    the initial flare peaks at 730  s. it takes place both in the x - ray and optical bands , but it is very pronounced in the latter .",
    "its rapid temporal evolution ( the optical flux increased by a factor of @xmath124 between 400 and 800 s after the trigger ) suggests that it could be explained in the context of internal dissipation processes which occurred in the outflow , when the lorentz factor is very high and relativistic effects cause rapid variations of the observed flux .",
    "thus , grb 130831a may show a clear example of internal dissipation that produces strong emission in the optical other than in the x - ray .",
    "alternatively , the optical flare might flag the onset of fs emission .",
    "however , if this were the case , the decay slope after the flare peak would be consistent with the decay slope of the late optical afterglow @xmath166 .",
    "instead , the decay rate after the flare peak is @xmath319 , which is inconsistent with @xmath320 found later . after the flare",
    ", the early optical emission shows a plateau up to a few ks ( see section [ lcseds ] ) .",
    "typically , an early slow optical decay is interpreted as energy injection , which ends at the time of the break . however",
    ", this interpretation might be difficult in our scenario , because the energy injection would have to stop at @xmath321 ks while , according to our analysis , the grb outflow is still active at @xmath13 ks .",
    "a possibility is that the optical plateau basically results from the combination of the decaying optical flare and the rising of the fs peak , which has been shown for a number of _ swift _ bursts for which early optical light - curves are available ( oates et al .",
    "the peak lorentz factor @xmath322 of the ejecta then can be calculated ( molinari et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) as @xmath323 for a deceleration time @xmath324  s and adopting the values of energy and density we have determined above , the resulting peak lorentz factor would be @xmath325 , which is within the overall distribution of lorentz factors for grb afterglows ( oates et al .",
    "the reason for such a late deceleration , in our model , comes naturally given the low density of the circumburst medium . +",
    "the late emission , which we attribute to fs in our modeling , seems to have a relatively steep decay slope .",
    "so one may wonder whether it could give some important contribution to the x - ray flux as well at an earlier epoch .",
    "if we extrapolate the late x - ray flux to earlier epochs using a decay slope of @xmath326 , it would become comparable to or even higher than the observed x - ray flux at the end of the first orbit ( at @xmath117  s ) and the shape of the x - ray light - curve would differ from what we see . however , if the fs onset occurs at @xmath327  s , this problem is avoided . as for the observations from @xmath328  ks ( i.e. the beginning of the second orbit ) onwards , at 10 ks the flux by fs emission is @xmath329 erg @xmath32 s@xmath18 @xmath330 erg @xmath32 s@xmath18 , which is @xmath331 times weaker than the observed x - ray flux .",
    "afterwards , the fs flux decreases faster than that of  internal origin \" that we see , which decays with a slope of @xmath332 .",
    "similarly , for a @xmath160 and flux density in the r band ( @xmath333  hz ) of @xmath334 @xmath75jy at 10  ks , the expected x - ray 0.3 - 10 kev flux is @xmath335 erg @xmath32 s@xmath18 .",
    "this is again @xmath331 times lower than the x - ray flux observed at 10 ks .",
    "thus , the x - ray flux from 9 ks up to the steep drop is not predominantly produced by the fs .",
    "we have discussed the case of the long _ swift _ grb 130831a .",
    "the x - ray afterglow of this burst initially shows a shallow decay .",
    "however , at @xmath13 ks the x - ray light - curve breaks to an unusually steep decay slope @xmath336 , which can not be explained by the standard fs model .",
    "late xrt and especially _ chandra _ observations show that the x - ray afterglow has a successive break to a more sedate decay with a slope @xmath337 .",
    "the well - sampled optical afterglow shows no change of slope concurrent with the steep break in the x - ray band , which we interpret as arising from a different mechanism . by means of data taken by _ swift _ , _",
    "chandra _ and several ground - based observatories , we have shown that both the optical and late x - ray emissions , after @xmath338  ks after the trigger , have the typical decay and spectral slopes of grb afterglows explained by the fs model .",
    "we have interpreted the x - ray and optical afterglow as the superposition of two emission components .",
    "one component is of  internal \" origin , generated within a relativistic outflow and responsible for the early x - ray emission up to @xmath13  ks ; the outflow is produced by either the spin - down of a newly formed magnetar or a black hole feeding on fall - back matter .",
    "a second component , responsible for the late x - ray and optical from a few ks after the trigger , is the typical fs emission .",
    "when the magnetar has lost much of its rotational energy or the black hole does not accrete and does not power the outflow any longer , the first component dies off and we see the steep x - ray decay that lasts until the standard fs emission emerges .",
    "we believe that the magnetar model is favoured , since the other scenario would require a rather peculiar stellar progenitor structure and fall - back process .    modeling the late optical and x - ray afterglow ,",
    "we have inferred the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta and thus an efficiency @xmath339 of the  central engine \" of this grb to produce @xmath340-ray emission .",
    "this efficiency is smaller than that of other bursts that show emission of internal origin ( l & zhang 2014 ; although these were examined in the x - ray band only ) , and more typical of those grbs in which no internal emission is clearly visible .",
    "thus , grb 130831a may represent a  trait dunion \" between grbs with different dominant emission processes .    more importantly , gathering the information on the kinetic energy of the supernova associated with 130831a , we have provided a breakdown of the energetics of the grb and its associated supernova .",
    "we have found that , regardless of the nature of the central engine and unknown collimation of the ejecta , at least @xmath306 of the total energy of the event is coupled with relativistic ejecta ; and less ( probably significantly less ) than @xmath341 of the energy goes into x - ray emission of  internal origin \" lasting up to 100 ks in our case ; this component produces a factor @xmath342 less energy than that released in @xmath340-ray during the prompt emission .",
