    "bottomonium mesons , the bound states of bottom quark - antiquark pairs , play an important role in the study of the strong interactions .",
    "the spectrum of bottomonium is known very well from experiment and there are many different approaches to calculating it theoretically .",
    "lattice qcd provides a model - independent and accurate way of doing this .",
    "one of the most important steps toward realistic lattice qcd calculations was the inclusion of dynamical light ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) sea quarks . for many quantities of phenomenological interest ,",
    "lattice qcd now allows reliable non - perturbative calculations that were previously impossible . in order to further control systematic errors and increase the confidence in lattice results ,",
    "it is crucial to consider several different lattice actions and thereby test universality .",
    "the rbc and ukqcd collaborations have recently started large - scale lattice qcd calculations @xcite with dynamical domain wall fermions and renormalization - group - improved gauge actions .",
    "the domain wall fermion action @xcite has an approximate chiral symmetry that becomes exact , even at finite lattice spacing , when the extent @xmath8 of the auxiliary fifth dimension is taken to infinity .",
    "this leads to better control over the renormalization of operators , a reduction of discretization errors and more reliable chiral extrapolations .",
    "the gauge configurations created by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations have been made publicly available . in this work ,",
    "the ensembles of size @xmath9 , @xmath10 described in detail in @xcite were used to compute the spectrum of bottomonium .",
    "chiral symmetry is not as important for bottomonium as it is for light hadrons , but the calculations presented here nevertheless provide useful tests of the recent lattice calculations by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations . in particular , they provide an independent determination of the lattice spacing and a good way of tuning the @xmath2 quark mass . the value of the bare @xmath2 quark mass obtained here can also be used in lattice qcd calculations for heavy - light hadrons such as @xmath11 mesons , which are of considerable importance for the phenomenology of weak decays and tests of the standard model .",
    "the @xmath2 quark has a mass larger than the inverse lattice spacing , so that the standard lattice actions as used for light quarks are not suitable to describe it .",
    "a preliminary calculation of the bottomonium spectrum on the rbc / ukqcd gauge configurations using a relativistic heavy - quark action was presented in @xcite . here ,",
    "improved non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite is employed instead , following closely the methods used in the calculation of the bottomonium spectrum on the milc gauge configurations in @xcite ( these configurations use an improved staggered fermion action for the sea quarks and a one - loop symanzik - improved gluon action ) .",
    "the lattice calculation and analysis methods are described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice_calculation ] .",
    "the results for the tuning of the @xmath2 quark mass and tests of the dispersion relation are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass_tuning ] and [ sec : speed_of_light ] , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec : radial_orbital_splittings ] , the results for the radial and orbital energy splittings as well as the lattice spacing are presented , followed by the fine and hyperfine structure in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin_dep_splittings ] .",
    "the details of the domain wall fermion and iwasaki gauge actions as used by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations are given in @xcite . here , the gauge configurations of size @xmath9 as described in @xcite were used .",
    "these have @xmath10 , @xmath12 and the strange quark mass is @xmath13 .",
    "there are ensembles with four different values for the degenerate light ( up and down ) quark mass @xmath14 , as shown in table [ tab : lattices ] .",
    ".[tab : lattices]the ensembles of rbc / ukqcd gauge configurations used here . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      figure [ fig : s_wave_hyperfine ] shows a plot of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 energy splittings , where the previous lattice spacing determinations from the @xmath18 splittings were used to convert to physical units .",
    "s - wave hyperfine splittings ( energies relative to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 states , respectively ) compared to experiment .",
    "errors are statistical / fitting only and include the uncertainty in the determination of the lattice spacing , which enters with a factor of 2 .",
    "large systematic errors are expected as discussed in the text . ]",
    "the errors shown are statistical / fitting only but include the uncertainty in the determination of the lattice spacing .",
    "the latter in fact enters with a factor of 2 here , as discussed in @xcite , due to the resulting uncertainty in the physical heavy quark mass ( the hyperfine splitting is approximately proportional to the inverse of that mass ) . the statistical error in the @xmath21 hyperfine splitting",
    "is then dominated by far by this uncertainty , while the @xmath22 hyperfine splitting has an intrinsically higher statistical error as the state is radially excited .",
    "the @xmath16 splitting has recently been measured by the babar collaboration @xcite , who found @xmath23 mev .",
    "this value is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_wave_hyperfine ] .",
    "the lattice result in physical units for the @xmath24 ensemble is @xmath25 mev , which is too small by about 25% , in line with the large systematic errors expected . similarly to the radial and orbital splittings , little dependence on the light sea quark mass is seen , which is expected for the same reason as discussed there",
    ".    note that in @xcite and @xcite a significant dependence on the lattice spacing was found , with the result increasing toward finer lattices , indicating that a substantial part of the deviation is due to discretization errors .",
    "the hyperfine splitting is indeed expected to be sensitive to very short distances , as the spin - spin interaction potentials in simple models contain a delta function at the origin ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , note that in @xcite , where a relativistic heavy - quark action was used , the @xmath16 splitting on the same rbc / ukqcd gauge configurations was found to be only @xmath26 mev , a much larger deviation to experiment than found here .      a plot of the @xmath28 spin - dependent splittings , converted to physical units using the previous @xmath18 lattice spacing results , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_wave_spin_splittings ] .     p - wave spin splittings ( energies relative to the spin - average of the @xmath29 states ) compared to experiment .",

    "it shows the energy differences of the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 states to the spin - average of the triplet @xmath34 .",
    "the experimental results @xcite for the triplet states are also indicated in the plot ; the @xmath35 states have not yet been observed .",
    "the lattice results are found to be in relatively good agreement with experiment , even within the purely statistical / fitting errors shown in the plot ( those include the uncertainty in the lattice spacing ) .",
    "this indicates that discretization errors may be smaller than for the @xmath15-wave hyperfine splittings .",
    "note that in simple potential models the wave function at the origin is zero ( cf .",
    "the smearing functions in table [ tab : smear_funcs ] ) and hence the @xmath27-wave spin splittings are expected to be not as sensitive to very short distances as the @xmath15-wave hyperfine splittings .",
    "the result for the experimentally unknown @xmath36 splitting on the @xmath24 ensemble is @xmath37 mev , where the error quoted is statistical / fitting only and includes the uncertainty from the determination of the lattice spacing .      here",
    ", only the @xmath39 splitting was calculated using the @xmath40 and @xmath41 representations , as these two states do not mix and can be computed from the same heavy - quark propagators .",
    "the lattice results for the different ensembles are listed in table [ tab : spin_splittings ] . on the @xmath24 ensemble , the splitting in physical units is found to be @xmath42 mev where the error given is statistical / fitting only and includes the uncertainty from the determination of the lattice spacing .",
    "no experimental results are available .",
    "in this paper , a comprehensive calculation of the bottomonium spectrum with improved lattice nrqcd on the rbc / ukqcd @xmath9 , @xmath10 gauge configurations with 2 + 1 flavors of dynamical domain wall fermions was presented .",
    "the results are similar to those obtained in @xcite with the same heavy - quark action from the `` coarse '' milc gauge configurations , which use the asqtad fermion action and the lscher - weisz gluon action .",
    "in particular , good agreement with experiment was found for the radial and orbital energy splittings , for which systematic errors due to the nrqcd action are small .",
    "furthermore , no significant deviations of the `` speed of light '' from 1 in the @xmath43 dispersion relation were found within the small statistical errors .",
    "the calculations in this work provide further evidence for the good properties of the domain wall and iwasaki actions employed by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations . by comparing the @xmath18 radial energy splitting to experiment , independent determinations of the lattice spacings",
    "were performed , giving @xmath44 gev for the most chiral ensemble .",
    "the results for the fine and hyperfine structure are expected to have larger systematic errors due to missing radiative and relativistic corrections in the nrqcd action as well as discretization errors .",
    "nevertheless , relatively good agreement with experiment was seen for the @xmath27-wave fine structure , and the deviation to experiment in the @xmath21 hyperfine splitting was found to be much smaller than for the previous result obtained from a relativistic heavy quark action in @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here are only for one lattice spacing .",
    "a more systematic analysis of discretization errors will be performed once new ensembles with a finer lattice spacing are made available by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations .",
    "having obtained the bottomonium spectrum and the bare heavy quark mass in this work , the next step is to perform calculations for heavy - light systems .",
    "results for the spectrum of heavy - light baryons and mesons with domain wall valence quarks but with _ static _",
    "heavy quarks were recently presented in @xcite .",
    "heavy - light computations with nrqcd heavy- and domain wall light valence quarks on the same rbc / ukqcd gauge field ensembles are currently underway .",
    "the author would like to thank matthew wingate for initially suggesting this project , for many valuable discussions and for reading the manuscript .",
    "thanks also go to christine davies and ron horgan for helpful discussions .",
    "the author is indebted to the rbc and ukqcd collaborations for making their gauge configurations publicly available .",
    "the gauge configurations were fixed to coulomb / landau gauge using the chroma software @xcite .",
