    "observations of redshifted @xmath10 radiation from the large scale distribution of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) are perceived as one of the most promising future probes of the universe at high redshifts ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "observational evidence from quasar absorption spectra @xcite and the cmbr @xcite together imply that the hi was reionized over an extended period spanning the redshift range @xmath11 ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "determining how and when the universe was reionized is one of the most important issues that will be addressed by future @xmath12 observations .",
    "the giant meter wave radio telescope ( gmrt ; @xcite ) , currently functioning at several frequency bands in the range @xmath13 to @xmath14 is very well suited for carrying out initial investigations towards detecting the reionization hi signal .",
    "there are several upcoming low - frequency instruments such as lofar , mwa , 21cmapast/ ] and ska which are being built specifically with these observations in view .",
    "it is currently perceived that a statistical analysis of the fluctuations in the redshifted @xmath0 signal holds the greatest potential for observing hi at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "correlations among the visibilities measured in radio - interferometric observations directly probe the hi power spectrum at the epoch where the radiation originated . the reionization visibility signal at the gmrt is expected to be @xmath15 and smaller ( @xcite ) .",
    "this hi signal is present as a minute component of the background in all low frequency observations , and it is buried in foreground radiation from other astrophysical sources whose contribution is @xmath16 to @xmath17 orders of magnitude larger . extracting the hi signal from the foregrounds is a major challenge .    individual sources can be identified and removed from the image at a flux level which depends on the sensitivity . the contribution from the remaining discrete sources could be large enough to overwhelm the hi signal @xcite .",
    "the diffuse synchrotron emission from our galaxy @xcite is another important component .",
    "foreground sources include free - free emission from ionizing halos @xcite , faint radio loud quasars @xcite and synchrotron emission from low redshift galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the foregrounds are expected to have a continuum spectra , and the contribution at two different frequencies separated by @xmath18 are expected to be highly correlated .",
    "the hi signal is expected to be uncorrelated at such a frequency separation and this holds the promise of allowing us to separate the signal from the foregrounds .",
    "a possible approach is to subtract a best fit continuum spectra for each line of sight @xcite and then use the residuals to determine the hi power spectrum .",
    "an alternate approach is to first determine the statistical properties of the total radiation and then subtract out the smooth @xmath19 dependent part to extract the hi signal @xcite .",
    "the issue of foreground removal has also been studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is crucial to accurately characterize the foregrounds in order to be able to detect the hi signal in future observations . in this paper",
    "we used gmrt observations to characterize the foregrounds at @xmath20 which corresponds to an hi signal from @xmath21 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to directly characterize the foregrounds at angular scales ( @xmath22 to sub - arcminute ) and frequency coverage ( @xmath23 with @xmath24 resolution ) relevant for detecting the reionization hi signal .",
    "we next present a brief outline of the paper . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction while in section 3 we present `` visibility - correlations '' which we use to quantify the statistical properties of our radio - interferometric data .",
    "section 4 presents the predictions of existing foreground models , and in section 5 we present our results and discuss their implications .",
    "the gmrt has a hybrid configuration ( @xcite ) where @xmath25 of the @xmath26 antennas are randomly distributed in a central square @xmath27 in extent .",
    "these provide the @xmath28 coverage at small baselines . here",
    "baseline refers to the antenna separation , and we use the two dimensional vector @xmath29 to denote the component perpendicular to the direction of observation . note that @xmath29 has cartesian components @xmath30 and is dimensionless being in units of the observing wavelength .",
    "the shortest baseline at the gmrt is @xmath31 which comes down to around @xmath32 with projection effects .",
    "the rest of the antennas in the gmrt lie along three arms in an approximately y configuration .",
    "these provide @xmath28 coverage at long baselines ( the longest baseline is @xmath33 ) .",
    "the diameter of each gmrt antenna is @xmath34 .",
    "the hybrid configuration gives reasonably good sensitivity for both compact and extended sources .",

    "here @xmath30 are the antenna separations in wavelength units at the observing frequency @xmath20.,width=283 ]    on @xmath35 june , @xmath36 we observed a field centered on upsilon andromedae ( which is an extra - solar planetary system system at @xmath37 for a total of 14 hours ( including calibration ) .",
    "no emission that could be attributed to the planet was detected in our observations .",
    "the galactic co - ordinates are @xmath38 . from the 408 mhz @xcite map",
    "the sky temperature at this location is @xmath39  k ( at 408  mhz ) , and there is no structure visible at the angular resolution of the map .",
    "the observational set up used a total of @xmath40 frequency channels spanning @xmath41 centered at @xmath20 .",
    "each frequency channel is @xmath42 wide .",
    "a @xmath23 wide band - pass filter was introduced in the if stage to exclude known strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , hence only @xmath43 of the central channels contain astronomical signals .",
    "the integration time was 16 seconds , and visibilities were recorded for two orthogonal circular polarizations .",
    "the visibility data were analyzed using the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) .",
    "the calibrator source 3c48 was used for flux , phase and bandpass calibration .",
    "the calibrator was observed every half hour so as to correct for temporal variations in the system gain .",
    "standard aips tasks were used to flag all data that could be visually identified as being bad .",
    "we then made a high resolution image of the source using only a single channel ( channel 35 ) .",
    "the synthesized beam has a fwhm of @xmath44 and the rms .",
    "noise in the cleaned image is @xmath45 .",
    "all sources with flux density more than @xmath46 were fitted with clean components ( cc ) , these components were merged and the visibilities corresponding to components with flux more than @xmath47 were subtracted from the multi - channel @xmath28 data using uvsub . the value @xmath47 was chosen because we find predominantly positive clean components above this flux level whereas positive and negative components are equally abundant below this .",
    "the resultant @xmath28 data is now expected to be dominated by noise and residual rfi , since the majority of the point sources have been removed . visually inspecting the data using the aips tasks vplot and uvhgm",
    ", we decided to clip the data at @xmath48 whereby visibilities with amplitude greater than @xmath48 were discarded .",
    "the clipping amplitude is in principle crucial since one would like to ensure that all baselines with rfi contributions have been discarded , without throwing away any good baselines . in practice we found that the exact clipping value does not make a substantial difference in our subsequent analysis .",
    "after this we added back the visibilities corresponding to all the cc components that we had subtracted . to first order , one could expected that at this stage all strong rfi has been removed .",
    "the large field of view ( @xmath49 ) of the gmrt at @xmath50 lead to considerable errors if the non - planar nature of the gmrt antenna distribution is not taken into account .",
    "we use the three dimensional ( 3d ) imaging feature ( e.g.,@xcite ) in the aips task imagr in which the entire field of view is divided into multiple subfields ( facets ) each of which is imaged separately . here a @xmath51 field of view was imaged using @xmath52 facets .",
    "we first collapsed @xmath53 adjacent channels ( channels @xmath26 to @xmath54 ) to make a single channel which was used to make a cleaned image .",
    "this channel s frequency width @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) which is sufficiently small so as to avoid bandwidth smearing .",
    "the synthesized beam has fwhm @xmath57 and the cleaned image has rms noise @xmath58 .",
    "the presence of a large number of sources in the field allows us to do self calibration loops to improve the image quality .",
    "the data went through @xmath16 rounds of phase self calibration and a @xmath17 th round where self calibration was done for both amplitude and phase .",
    "the time interval for the gain correction was chosen as @xmath59 and @xmath60 minutes for the successive self calibration loops .",
    "noise in the final cleaned image was @xmath61 and the image quality had improved considerably . the final gain table was applied to all @xmath40 frequency channels .",
    "channels @xmath62 to @xmath63 of this data were then collapsed into 8 channels , each containing @xmath53 of the original frequency channels .",
    "we use these to make a continuum image of the entire field .",
    "some more data was flagged at this stage , and we then applied a final phase self calibration loop .",
    "this calibrated data was used to make the final cleaned image which is shown in figure [ fig : a2 ] .",

    "noise level of @xmath65 .",
    "note that several of the extended features like the one at @xmath66 are actually imaging artifacts around the brightest point sources .",
    "the brightest sources are also found to be accompanied by a region of negative flux density , these are presumably the results if residual phase errors which were not corrected for in our self calibration process .",
    "the maximum and minimum flux density in the final image are @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "recall that for this experiment , the sources visible in the final continuum image ( figure [ fig : a2 ] ) are contaminants which have to be removed .",
    "pixels with flux density above @xmath69 which were visually identified as sources and not imaging artifacts were fitted with clean components .",
    "the clean components were merged and the visibilities corresponding to these clean components were subtracted from the original full frequency resolution @xmath28 data using the aips task uvsub .",
    "it is expected that at this stage most of the genuine sources in figure [ fig : a2 ] have been removed from the data .",

    "the subsequent analysis was done using the visibility data .",
    "we have analyzed the data both before and after the sources were subtracted , and we shall refer to these as * data i * ( initial - before source subtraction ) and * data r * ( residual - after source subtraction ) respectively .",
    "the final data contains @xmath72 baselines , each of which has visibilities for @xmath60 circular polarizations and @xmath73 frequency channels , of which we have used only the first @xmath74 channels for the subsequent analysis .",
    "the visibilities from the two polarizations were combined for the subsequent analysis .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the resulting visibilities have a mean value @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively , and rms of @xmath77 for both in * data i*. for * data r * the real and imaginary parts of the visibilities have a mean @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively whereas the rms is @xmath80 for both .    in the subsequent analysis it is often convenient to assume that the visibilities have a gaussian distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : h1 ] shows the distribution of the real part of the visibilities for * data r*. we find that a gaussian gives a reasonably good fit to the data within @xmath81 which contains the bulk of the data .",
    "the number counts predicted by the gaussian falls much faster than the data at large visibility values @xmath82 .",
    "deviation from gaussian statistics is expected to mainly affect the error estimate on the visibility correlation .",
    "we expect this effect to be small , since only a small fraction of visibilities are discrepant . the imaginary part of of * data r * , and the real and imaginary parts of * data i * all show a similar behaviour .",
    "the visibility @xmath83 measured in a radio - interferometric observation is the sum of three different contributions @xmath84 the hi signal @xmath85 , astrophysical foregrounds @xmath86 and system noise @xmath87 .",
    "we treat all three of these contributions as uncorrelated random variables with zero mean .",
    "the statistical properties of the visibility can be quantified through the two visibility correlation ( henceforth the visibility correlation )    @xmath88    and @xmath89    where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively refer to the signal , foreground and noise contributions to the visibility correlation .    the contribution from the hi signal @xmath90",

    "this is negligible compared to the expected foregrounds and noise contributions in our observations , and hence we ignore it in our further analysis .",

    "the convolution with the primary beam pattern ( eq . ( [ eq : a4 ] ) ) becomes important .",
    "we have not included this , and the actual model predictions would possibly be somewhat smaller if this were included . as noted in section 4 .",
    ", the amplitude of the synchrotron contribution is very sensitive to the value of the spectral index",
    ". the amplitude decreases by a factor of @xmath224 if @xmath225 instead of the value @xmath192 used here .",
    "this changes the total foreground contribution only at small baselines ( @xmath226 ) where the model then becomes consistent with our observations .",
    "the limiting flux for source subtraction is @xmath227 , and hence we use @xmath228 for * data r*. the model prediction is dominated by galactic synchrotron radiation at @xmath229 , point source clustering in the range @xmath230 and point source poisson fluctuations at @xmath231 .",
    "the model predictions fall short of the observations at all baselines except the smallest @xmath123 value where it overshoots the observations .",
    "since the model prediction for @xmath232 falls very much short of the observations , we also consider @xmath233 where the dominant contribution is galactic synchrotron at @xmath234 , point source clustering in the range @xmath235 and point source poisson fluctuations at @xmath236 .",
    "we find that the observations are slightly above the @xmath213 error - bars at baselines @xmath237 , whereas they exceed the model predictions at baselines @xmath238 .",
    "a point to note is that at the smallest baseline the prediction for the galactic synchrotron radiation exceeds the observation .",
    "this may be a consequence of the possibility that the background radiation is relatively low in the direction of our observation .",
    "estimates from the @xcite map at @xmath239 show a relatively low brightness temperature of @xmath240 towards the direction of our observation .",
    "we quantify the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath205 using @xmath7 which is defined as @xmath241    we expect the visibilities @xmath83 and @xmath242 to get decorrelated as @xmath19 is increased , and hence we expect @xmath243 . figure [ fig : r3 ] shows @xmath7 for different values of @xmath123 .",
    "the foreground models predict a smooth @xmath19 dependence for @xmath7 .",
    "the departure from @xmath244 is predicted to be less than @xmath8 for @xmath245 .",
    "the observed behavior of @xmath7 is quite different from the model predictions . at the small baselines @xmath246",
    "we find that @xmath7 falls sharply within the first three channels . in the @xmath247 bin",
    "@xmath7 fluctuates at large @xmath248 whereas it remains roughly constant at @xmath249 .",
    "in both cases this value of @xmath7 is smaller for * data r * as compared to * data i*. at @xmath250 , for * data i * @xmath7 falls gradually with increasing @xmath19 , and the visibilities are uncorrelated ( @xmath251 ) by @xmath252 .",
    "interestingly , for * data r * we find that @xmath7 shows a sudden increase to @xmath253 at very small @xmath19 ( @xmath254 ) , after which @xmath7 falls and becomes negative by @xmath255 .",
    "it appears that in this @xmath123 bin our source subtraction procedure has introduced excess correlations between the visibilities at small @xmath19 and introduces anti correlations at large @xmath19 . at @xmath256 , for * data i * the value of @xmath7 oscillates with increasing @xmath248 . at large @xmath19 * data r * also shows a similar behavior except that the @xmath7 values are smaller .",
    "the behavior of * data r * is quite different from that of * data i * at very small @xmath19 where there are two small oscillations that cross @xmath257 .",
    "the first point that emerges from our results is that the observed visibility correlations @xmath258 is consistent with the predictions of the existing foreground models at all baselines except the smallest one which probes angular scales @xmath259 .",
    "the observations are in excess of the model prediction at the smallest baseline .",
    "the second point is that @xmath205 shows considerable @xmath19 dependence , there being changes of order unity within @xmath260 .",
    "this rapid change in the visibilities @xmath261 across frequency channels is contrary to the foreground models which predict changes less than @xmath8 .",
    "it is well appreciated that accurate subtraction of the foreground emission requires very exacting calibration .",
    "in contrast , we have followed fairly standard calibration procedures . as such it seems likely that",
    "the discrepancy between our observations and existing predictions is probably not genuine ; indeed there are a several purely instrument related possibilities that may account for the discrepancies between our observational findings and existing models for the foreground emission .",
    "we take up first the issue of calibration error which will introduce phase and amplitude errors in the visibilities .",
    "the fact that the values of @xmath7 are generally smaller for * data r * as compared to * data i * may be interpreted as indicating that the visibilities @xmath262 are a combination of two parts , a correlated part which arises from for e.g. the effect of calibration errors on discrete sources , and another whose contribution to different channels is uncorrelated .",
    "the `` halos '' that we see around the bright sources is a clear indication that calibration problems exist in our data .",
    "phase errors which vary with channel would cause decorrelation of the visibilities across different frequencies .",
    "further , one would expect that the phase errors increase with increasing baseline length , which is qualitatively consistent with what we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : r3 ] .",
    "in contrast to the situation for @xmath7 , the contribution from the source subtraction residuals to @xmath6 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : r2 ] ) can be estimated to be small as follows .",
    "there are only @xmath263 imaging artifacts with absolute value of flux @xmath264  mjy ( * data r * , figure [ fig : a3 ] ) , while about 10,000 such sources would be needed to produce the observed visibility correlation of @xmath265jy@xmath266 ( * data r * , figure [ fig : r2 ] ) .",
    "the 2d fourier relation between the sky brightness and the visibilities assumed in section  3 is not strictly valid for gmrt s large field of view @xmath267 ) .",
    "in addition to @xmath268 which are the components of the baseline in the plane normal to the direction of observation , it is also necessary to consider @xmath269 the component along the observing direction .",
    "this is a possible source of error in our visibility correlation analysis . to asses the impact of the @xmath269 term we have repeated the analysis using only a limited range of baselines for which @xmath270 .",
    "we find that limiting the maximum @xmath269 value does not make any qualitative change in our results .",
    "the conclusions are unchanged even if we impose @xmath271 .    residual rfi is another possibility .",
    "the visibilities were clipped at @xmath48 ( section 2 . ) and this is expected to remove the strong rfi , but weak rfi contributions will persist in the data . the rfi electric fields at any two antennas is correlated with a time delay @xmath272 which depends on position of the rfi source relative to the antennas and the direction of observation .",
    "the rfi contribution behaves like the system noise if @xmath272 is greater than @xmath273 the coherence time of the rfi signal . in this case",
    "the rfi effectively increases @xmath274 the rms .",
    "fluctuations of the visibilities .",
    "this only changes the error estimates , and does not affect the expected visibility correlations .",
    "rfi sources for which @xmath275 are expected to affect the visibility correlations .",
    "this contribution will depend on the distribution of the time delays @xmath272s and the frequency spectrum of the rfi sources .",
    "the analysis of this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "work is currently underway at the gmrt to implement more sophisticated real time as well as offline rfi mitigation schemes .",
    "future observations will help assess the improvement that these schemes as well as better calibration procedures make on the problem of foreground subtraction .",
    "polarization leakage is another important issue that we plan to take up in future work .",

    "the data used in this paper were obtained using gmrt .",
