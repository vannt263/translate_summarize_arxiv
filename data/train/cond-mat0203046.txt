    "stochastic dynamics of stock prices is commonly described by a geometric ( multiplicative ) brownian motion , which gives a log - normal probability distribution function ( pdf ) for stock price changes ( returns ) @xcite .",
    "however , numerous observations show that the tails of the pdf decay slower than the log - normal distribution predicts ( the so - called `` fat - tails '' effect ) @xcite .",
    "particularly , much attention was devoted to the power - law tails @xcite .",
    "the geometric brownian motion model has two parameters : the drift @xmath0 , which characterizes the average growth rate , and the volatility @xmath1 , which characterizes the noisiness of the process .",
    "there is empirical evidence and a set of stylized facts indicating that volatility , instead of being a constant parameter , is driven by a mean - reverting stochastic process @xcite .",
    "various mathematical models with stochastic volatility have been discussed in literature @xcite .    in this paper , we study a particular stochastic volatility model , called the heston model @xcite , where the square of the stock - price volatility , called the variance @xmath2 , follows a random process known in financial literature as the cox - ingersoll - ross process and in mathematical statistics as the feller process @xcite . using the fourier and",
    "laplace transforms @xcite , we solve the fokker - planck equation for this model exactly and find the joint pdf of returns and variance as a function of time , conditional on the initial value of variance .",
    "while returns are readily known from a financial time - series data , variance is not given directly , so it acts as a hidden stochastic variable .",
    "thus , we integrate the joint pdf over variance and obtain the marginal probability distribution function of returns _ _",
    "un__conditional on variance .",
    "the latter pdf can be directly compared with financial data .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between our results and the dow - jones data for the 20-years period of 19822001 .",
    "using only four fitting parameters , our equations very well reproduce the pdf of returns for time lags between 1 and 250 trading days .",
    "in contrast , in arch , garch , egarch , tarch , and similar models , the number of fitting parameters can easily go to a few tens @xcite .",
    "our result for the pdf of returns has the form of a one - dimensional fourier integral , which is easily calculated numerically or , in certain asymptotical limits , analytically . for large returns , we find that the pdf is exponential in log - returns , which implies a power - law distribution for returns , and we calculate the time dependence of the corresponding exponents . in the limit of long times ,",
    "the pdf exhibits scaling , i.e.  it becomes a function of a single combination of return and time , with the scaling function expressed in terms of a bessel function .",
    "the dow - jones data follow the predicted scaling function for seven orders of magnitude .",
    "the original paper @xcite solved the problem of option pricing for the heston model .",
    "numerous subsequent studies @xcite compared option pricing derived from this model and its extensions with the empirical data on option pricing .",
    "they found that the heston model describes the empirical option prices much better than the black - scholes theory , and modifications of the heston model , such as adding discontinuous jumps , further improve the agreement .",
    "however , these papers did not address the fundamental question whether the stock market actually follows the heston stochastic process or not . obviously , if the answer is negative , then using the heston model for option pricing would not make much sense .",
    "the stock - market time series was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite jointly with option prices , but the focus was just on extracting the effective parameters of the heston model .",
    "in contrast , we present a comprehensive comparison of the stock market returns distribution with the predictions of the heston model . using a single set of four parameters",
    ", we fit the whole family of pdf curves for a wide variety of time lags . in order to keep the model as simple as possible with the minimal number of fitting parameters",
    ", we use the original heston model and do not include later modifications proposed in literature , such as jumps , multiple relaxation time , etc .",

    "the latter term is the only source of asymmetry in @xmath30 of @xmath80 when @xmath89 .",
    "however , in practice , the asymmetry of the slopes @xmath217 is quite small ( about 2.7% ) compared with the average slope @xmath218 .    by fitting the dow - jones data to our formula",
    ", we implicitly assumed that the parameters of the stochastic process ( @xmath14 , @xmath13 , @xmath16 , @xmath0 ) do not change in time . while this assumption may be reasonable for a limited time interval , the parameters generally could change in time .",
    "the time interval of our fit , 19822001 , includes the crash of 1987 , so one might expect that the parameters of the fit would change if we use a different interval . to verify this conjecture , in figs .",
    "[ fig : data ] and [ fig : bessel ] , we also compare the data points for the time interval 19902001 with the theoretical curves produced using the same values for the parameters as shown in table [ paramval ] .",

    "an alternative point of view in literature is that the time evolution of volatility is not characterized by a single relaxation rate .",
    "as shown in appendix [ sec : correlation ] , the variance correlation function @xmath220 ( [ cv - t ] ) in the heston model has a simple exponential decay in time .",

    "@xcite argues that volatility relaxation is multifractal and has no characteristic time .",

    "@xcite and @xcite shows , the main drop of @xmath220 takes place within a reasonably well - defined and relatively short time , whereas residual relaxation is stretched over a very long time .",
    "in this situation , a simple exponential time dependence , while not exact , may account for the main part of relaxation and give a reasonable approximation for the purposes of our study . alternatively , it is possible to generalize the heston model by incorporating more than one relaxation times @xcite .    as fig .",

    "there were numerous attempts in literature to reconstruct the probability distribution of volatility from the time - series data @xcite .",
    "generally , these papers agree that the central part of the distribution is well described by a log - normal distribution , but opinions vary on the fitting of the tails .",
    "particularly , ref .",
    "@xcite performed a fit with an alternative probability distribution of volatility described in ref .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately , none of these papers attempted to fit the data using eq .",
    "( [ pi_s ] ) , so we do not have a quantitative comparison . taking into account that we only need the integral ( [ dv_i ] ) , the exact shape of @xmath222 may be not so important , and eq.([pi_v ] ) may give a reasonably good approximation for our purposes , even if it does not fit the tails very precisely .",
    "although we tested our model for the dow - jones index , there is nothing specific in the model which indicates that it applies only to stock market data .",
    "it would be interesting to see how the model performs when applied to other time series , for example , the foreign exchange data @xcite , which also seem to exhibit exponential tails .",
    "the study @xcite indicates that our @xmath80 also works very well for the s&p 500 and nasdaq indices for 1980s and 1990s .",
