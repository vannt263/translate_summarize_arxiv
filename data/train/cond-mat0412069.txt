    "the research on vortex dynamics in high-@xmath3 superconductors ( hts ) is important since it has close connection with the potential applications in the future .",
    "it is known that the vortex system of the strong anisotropic cuprate superconductors , such as @xmath4 or @xmath0 , is very complicated because of high transition temperature and very short coherent length , and the vortex dynamics is particularly rich when a tilted field is applied .",
    "many puzzling experimental phenomena have been observed in the case of tilted vortices for high anisotropic superconductors , for example , one - dimensional chain state of vortex matter observed by hall probe microscopy@xcite and bitter decoration@xcite , stepwise behavior of vortex - lattice melting transition in tilted magnetic fields@xcite , suppression of irreversible magnetization by in - plane field@xcite , etc .",
    "the vortex dynamics has been studied extensively@xcite when the magnetic field is applied along @xmath2-axis of @xmath0 , however , the combined vortex lattice phases still remain largely unexplored in the tilted vortices scenario .    in this paper",
    ", we present the resistance of two @xmath0 thin film samples in flux flow region under tilted magnetic fields when the angle between the applied fields and the @xmath1-plane of the thin film is changed continuously .",
    "one of the measured thin film is grown on @xmath5 @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) substrate , and another is grown on a tilted @xmath7 substrate with the surface plane about 20@xmath8 away from the @xmath5 plane . the resistance as a function of angle demonstrates self - consistency . moreover",
    ", the resistance at the same fixed temperature can be well scaled versus the @xmath2-axis component of the applied magnetic fields . in addition , the measurement of resistance in this way may offer a complementary method to determine the growth orientation of the highly anisotropic superconductors , and it is a very convenient method to identify the tilt angle of the tilted - growth thin films .",
    "the @xmath0 films were deposited onto @xmath7 substrates using the dc magnetron sputtering method .",
    "one of which was @xmath2-axis - oriented film ( denoted as @xmath9-@xmath2 ) , and another ( denoted as @xmath9-@xmath10 ) was deposited on the substrate with surface cut at an angle about 20@xmath8 with respect to the @xmath5 basal plane ( see fig . 1 ( c ) ) .",
    "the details about the preparation of samples can be found in other literatures@xcite .",
    "the thickness of the thin film is about 3000  .",
    "the size of @xmath9-@xmath2 is about 5@xmath110.5 @xmath12 , and @xmath9-@xmath10 is patterned into a micro - bridge of 3 @xmath13 in length and 3 @xmath13 in width using photolithography and ion beam etching techniques .",
    "the resistance measurement was done with standard four - probe technique . in the case of sample @xmath9-@xmath10 ,",
    "the gold leads were attached by silver paste to the gold pads deposited onto the surface of the film .",
    "the contact resistance between the electrodes and sample was below 1 @xmath14 .",

    "the inset for @xmath9-@xmath2 thin film.,width=264 ]    the measurement of resistance was carried out on an oxford cryogenic maglab system ( maglab12exa ) with magnetic field up to 12 tesla and temperature ranging from 1.5 @xmath16 to 400 @xmath16 .",
    "the resistance was measured by bipolar mode , so each data point was the average of the measured results for the positive and negative transport current . because the sample platform can be rotated from 0@xmath8 to 360@xmath8 by a controlled step motor during the measurement , the angle between the sample and the magnetic field",
    "can be changed from 0@xmath8 to 360 @xmath8 continuously .",
    "so the @xmath1-plane ( or @xmath2-axis ) of the film can be coordinated exactly by the minimum ( or maximum ) of the resistance during the rotation of the film under applied field at fixed temperatures in the mixed state .",
    "the magnitude of the field and its direction can be varied precisely ( error bar 0.1@xmath8 ) and freely , which is particularly helpful and indispensable for the measurement of the tilted film . in the measurement process",
    ", the dc current i , goes through the film along the surface of the film , and the angle between the applied field and the film surface @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 , @xmath23 ) is changed continuously ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . here , @xmath17 is defined by the angle between the field and the @xmath1-plane when @xmath24 is always perpendicular to the @xmath25 ( fig.1 ( a ) ) , @xmath18 is the angle between @xmath24 and @xmath1-plane when @xmath24 is always in the plane of @xmath2-axis and @xmath25 ( fig . 1 ( b ) ) .",
    "for the 20@xmath26 tilted film @xmath9-@xmath10 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , here @xmath23 is the angle between @xmath24 and the surface of substrate ( fig . 1 ( c ) ) .",
    "for the film @xmath9-@xmath2 , we have carefully measured the resistance under various fields at different fixed temperatures in mixed state when @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) is changed from 0@xmath26 to 195@xmath26 continuously . for clarity , we only show some typical results here . the resistance under",

    "moreover , it is found that all curves at the same temperature can merge to a common one when we draw @xmath20 as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "the resistivity of an anisotropic superconductor in the mixed state is dominated by the effective field @xmath32 which can be expressed in the formula@xcite @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "our results of @xmath20 can be scaled with @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) perfectly , the anisotropy parameter @xmath34 of @xmath38 - 2212 must be very large .",
    "this is consistent with the reported large values of @xmath34 and the nearly two - dimensional limit for tl - based system@xcite .    in order to understand this 2@xmath39",
    "scaling law from vortex dynamics , we assume the following simplified phenomenological model based on the fact that the anisotropy parameter @xmath34 of @xmath38 - 2212 is very large . given a @xmath24 , we can simply decompose it into two parts for the case of angle @xmath17 : @xmath2-axis component @xmath30 and @xmath1-plane component @xmath40 . as we know , @xmath2-axis component of field ( @xmath30 ) generates small size pancake vortices ( pvs ) resident in the @xmath1-panes , which causes dissipation due to the easy motion of pvs driven by in - plane lorentz force . on the other hand , josephson vortices ( jvs ) with density proportional to @xmath40 ,",
    "are formed with the in - plane component of @xmath24 and subjected to the @xmath2-axis lorentz driving force , however it is much difficult for the jvs to move across the @xmath1-planes due to the strong intrinsic pinning of high anisotropic hts . as a result , the contribution of jvs to @xmath20 is negligible compared to that of pvs . for the case of angle @xmath18 ,",
    "the only @xmath2-axis - component field dependence of @xmath20 is mainly due to the absence of lorentz force for josephson vortex lines , because @xmath25 is parallel to the in - plane component of field @xmath41 .",
