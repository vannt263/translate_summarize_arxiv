    "some time ago it was suggested to study certain systems on lattices with trivial first homotopy group @xcite .",
    "the d - dimensional boundaries of ( d+1)-dimensional hypercubes have this property , being homotopic to @xmath4 . here",
    "we give a brief summary of recent results obtained by various subgroups of the present authors for such studies for compact @xmath2 pure gauge theory with mixed action @xcite , for the 2d ising model @xcite and for the 2d potts model @xcite .",
    "the original motivation was to check the possible relevance of periodic boundary conditions for the dynamics of looplike excitations ( like monopole loops in compact u(1 ) gauge theory ) . in the thermodynamic limit at the critical point",
    "the manifold becomes flat and should lead to a universal field theory independent of the details of the boundary conditions .",
    "other 2d studies on similar lattices include random as well as tetrahedral lattices @xcite and a recent investigation of the 7-vertex model ( the strong coupling schwinger model ) for a pillow - like topology @xcite .",
    "we studied the following lattices :    @xmath5}$ ]  : :    periodic b.c .",
    ", i.e. torus topology for the @xmath6    hypercubic lattice @xmath7}$ ]  : :    the surface of a @xmath8-dimensional @xmath9    hypercube , or its dual lattice @xmath10 ( where points of    @xmath11 are identified with    @xmath12dimensional objects of @xmath10 etc . ) @xmath13}$ ]  : :    like @xmath11 but with weight factors correcting for a    spherelike , smooth distribution of the curvature over the lattice @xmath14}$ ]  : :    a pillow - like shape , like the surface of a @xmath15    hypercube ; may be visualized as two copies of a @xmath6    hypercube glued together at their boundaries    in the finite size scaling ( fss ) analyses we use @xmath16 as the generic lattice size parameter , where the volume @xmath17 denotes the number of sites or plaquettes on 2d or 4d lattices , respectively .",
    "the monte carlo updating details depend on the studied system and are discussed below . in all cases",
    "bulk quantities were obtained at various values of the coupling and combined with the multihistogram method @xcite , giving @xmath18 this allows us to obtain continuous curves for the observables and to determine the complex positions of the partition function zeroes .",
    "also the combined data for the `` multihistogram '' provides for a reliable identification of possible 2-state signals in the distribution .",
    "we studied the peak positions ( pseudocritical couplings @xmath19 ) and peak values of the cumulants @xmath20 and the positions @xmath21 of the fisher zeroes closest to the real axis .    for 1@xmath22 order transitions",
    "one expects the fss behaviour @xmath23 with `` surface '' corrections of @xmath24 due to the inhomogeneities of the boundary ( curvature ) ; in @xmath25 this is the leading term @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 in ( [ pscfss ] ) depends on the considered cumulant .    for 2@xmath27 order transitions we expect @xmath28 with josephson s law @xmath29 ( for gaussian systems @xmath30 ; for a discontinuous transition @xmath31 ) . again in @xmath19 one expects `` surface '' corrections of @xmath24 .",
    "this was studied in @xcite in order to identify the fss effects of the new topology in more detail .",
    "we used lattices of various size and of type @xmath32 ( where there exists an analytic solution ) , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the updating was with the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm with typically @xmath36 measured configurations ( with an autocorrelation time @xmath37 ) per lattice size .",
    "the results were typical for the other systems as well . since @xmath38 one expects a leading fss behaviour @xmath39 .",
    "the pseudocritical points for the spherelike topologies are  compared to the torus values  very close to their thermodynamic values and exhibited a _ very small _",
    "contribution @xmath39 ; the scaling behaviour is dominated by the non - leading term @xmath40 which we interpret as coming from the boundary or curvature , respectively .",
    "this holds also for the real part of the closest fisher zero .",
    "both , the peak value of @xmath41 as well as @xmath42 , however , show scaling in perfect agreement with @xmath38 . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we find , that for the spherelike topology the zeroes approach the real axis in the complex coupling constant plane almost perpendicularly .",
    "thus the real part ( related to the pseudocritical points derived from the cumulants ) is always very close to the thermodynamic value with its scaling behaviour dominated by the @xmath40 term .",
    "in @xcite the @xmath43-state potts model for @xmath44 at the ( for @xmath45 extremely weak ) 1@xmath22 order transition is studied with multicanonical updating @xcite , typically @xmath36 updates for each lattice size .",
    "the lattices were of type @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "even for the weak signal of the @xmath45 model the histogram for the energy distribution exhibits a clear double peak structure ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus the spherical lattices do no `` wash out '' weak 2-state signals , as might be suspected .",
    "note that there is only one interface as compared to two for the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this difference may be of some technical advantage in the determination of the interface tension .",
    "the study @xcite of compact @xmath2 pure gauge action in the wilson formulation with an additional adjoint term ( coupling @xmath49 ) has been continued@xcite .",
    "for @xmath50 , studies for torus geometry find consistently stable 2-state signals , reconfirmed by the recent results of @xcite and @xcite ( who in particular emphasized the rle of monopole clusters for the phase transition ) . already in 1985 a careful study of this action at positive @xmath49 hinted at a tricritical point ( tcp ) @xcite near @xmath51 .",
    "however , 2-state signals have been observed even below that value @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "studies for spherelike topology show no 2-state signals in the energy distribution at @xmath52 @xcite for the studied lattices @xmath53 ( although they do show 2 states at e.g. @xmath54 ) .      in order to respond to a possible criticism of our original investigation of the model on @xmath11-lattices  where the curvature was concentrated on the edges and corners of the hypercubic lattice  we have continued work on an `` almost smooth sphere '' @xmath55 .",
    "there we project sites , links and plaquettes of @xmath56 or @xmath57 ( dual ) onto the surface of 4d spheres and introduce weight factors similar to those used by @xcite in their study of random triangulated lattices , @xmath58\\;.\\ ] ] here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the areas of the corresponding plaquette ( and its dual , respectively ) of the projected lattice .",
    "more technical details of the simulation have been discussed @xcite and will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . we have worked with lattices @xmath55 for @xmath61 ranging between 4 and 12 .",
    "the couplings were chosen in the immediate neighbourhood of the critical values of @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "since we never observed 2-state signals we did not implement multi - canonical updating . for each lattice size",
    "we typically accumulated @xmath64 updates ( 3-hit metropolis , for @xmath50 with an additional overrelaxation step ) .",
    "close to the phase transition we found quite large autocorrelation lengths ( 300 - 2000 ) .",
    "we find no indication of 2-state signals in the multi - histogram distributions .",
    "the values of the cumulants at their respective extrema are compatible with a continuous phase transition . like for the ising model , also here we observe in general smaller fs corrections than for the torus geometry ( periodic b.c . ) .",
    "the leading behaviour seems to be dominated again by the boundary or curvature term , i.e. suppressed by @xmath40 , which at first sight can not be distinguished from a leading scaling behaviour for @xmath65 .",
    "the peak values of @xmath41 show power law behaviour and in the table we give the range of values for @xmath66 ( and the resulting @xmath67 , if we use josephson s law ) from fits to data for all lattice sizes or without the largest and/or smallest lattices . these values appear to depend on @xmath49 .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that the fss law used for this fit is asymptotic and that there is a regular contribution to the value of @xmath41 which may be non - negligible for the lattice sizes entering the fit .",
    "if we study the closest fisher zeroes ( in the complex @xmath62-plane ) , we find a behaviour reminiscent to the discussed ising results .",
    "[ fig3 ] exhibits fss consistent with @xmath69 for all three values of @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "the results of the fit in table [ tabfit ] ) .",
    "once again @xmath68 gives the cleanest and most consistent result .",
    "we should mention , that this value of @xmath67 is compatible with neither the gaussian value 0.5 nor the `` discontinuity '' value 0.25 ; it is compatible with results obtained in the mid-80s with mcrg methods .",
    "more detailed analyses with improved statistics will be presented elsewhere @xcite ."
