    " t hooft s large @xmath1 expansion @xcite is an attractive possibility for understanding gauge theories . in this limit",
    "the gauge theory diagrams look like riemann surfaces with boundaries and handles .",
    "it is therefore natural to attempt to map the large @xmath1 expansion of gauge theories to some kind of string world - sheet expansion .",
    "the first concrete example of such a map was given by witten @xcite for the case of three dimensional chern - simons gauge theory where the boundaries of the string world - sheet are `` topological '' d - branes .",
    "recently the map between the large @xmath1 expansion and string expansion has been made precise @xcite in the context of type ii string theory . the idea of @xcite is to consider type iib string theory with a large number @xmath1 of d3-branes and take a limit where @xmath0 while keeping @xmath10 fixed , where @xmath11 is the type iib string coupling . in this setup",
    "we have four dimensional gauge theories with unitary gauge groups .",
    "a world - sheet with @xmath12 boundaries and @xmath13 handles is weighted with @xmath14 upon identification @xmath15 , this precisely maps to  t hooft s large @xmath1 expansion .",
    "this expansion is valid in the limit where @xmath16 and the effective coupling @xmath17 is fixed at a weak coupling value .    in @xcite the above idea",
    "was applied to prove that four dimensional gauge theories ( including the cases with no supersymmetry ) considered in @xcite are conformal to all orders in perturbation theory in the large @xmath1 limit . in particular , the corresponding gauge theories were obtained from type iib string theory with d3-branes imbedded in orbifolded space - time .",
    "the ultraviolet finiteness of string theory ( that is , one - loop tadpole cancellation conditions ) was shown to imply that the resulting ( non - abelian ) gauge theories where conformal in the large @xmath1 limit ( in all loop orders ) . moreover , in @xcite it was also proven that computation of any correlation function in these theories in the large @xmath1 limit reduces to the corresponding computation in the parent @xmath5 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "the all - order proofs in @xcite were possible due to the fact that the power of string perturbation techniques was utilized .",
    "in particular , string theory perturbation expansion is a very efficient way of summing up various field theory diagrams .",
    "thus , often a large number of field theory feynman diagrams in a given order of perturbation theory corresponds to a single string theory diagram with certain topology .",
    "this has been successfully exploited to compute tree and loop level scattering processes in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "( for a recent discussion , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite . )",
    "the all - order proofs in @xcite crucially depended on the fact that the string world - sheet expansion was self - consistent .",
    "in particular , the arguments in @xcite would not go through if the tadpoles were not cancelled .",
    "the tadpole cancellation conditions , however , ultimately produced theories which were ( super)conformal in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "in particular , the one - loop @xmath6-functions ( for non - abelian gauge groups ) in all of those theories were zero ( even at finite @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there exists a consistent string theory setup similar to that of @xcite which can produce : ( _ i _ ) finite gauge theories with gauge groups other than unitary ( in particular , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , and with matter other than bi - fundamentals ; ( _ ii _ ) non - finite gauge theories such that string theory perturbation techniques can be applied to learn about the gauge theories in the large @xmath1 limit . in this paper",
    "we consider precisely such a setup which is a generalization of the work in @xcite . here",
    "we will consider type iib string theory with d3-branes as well as orientifold planes .",
    "( in certain cases string consistency will also require presence of d7-branes . )",
    "that is , we are going to study gauge theories that arise from type iib orientifolds . in this framework",
    "we can expect appearance of @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge groups as well as matter other than bi - fundamentals ( in the product gauge groups ) .",
    "moreover , as we will see later , non - finite gauge theories can also be obtained within a consistent perturbative string theory framework . however , in all such theories obtained via orientifolds the running of the gauge couplings is suppressed in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "( in this sense these theories are `` finite '' in the large @xmath1 limit ) .",
    "introduction of orientifold planes changes the possible topologies of the world - sheet .",
    "now we can have a world - sheet with @xmath12 boundaries ( corresponding to d - branes ) , @xmath18 cross - caps ( corresponding to orientifold planes ) , and @xmath13 handles .",
    "such a world - sheet is weighted with @xmath19 note that addition of a cross - cap results in a diagram suppressed by an additional power of @xmath1 , so that in the large @xmath1 limit we can hope for simplifications ( or , rather , we can hope to avoid complications with unoriented world - sheets , at least in some cases ) .",
    "in fact , we will show that for string vacua which are perturbatively consistent ( that is , the tadpoles cancel ) calculations of correlation functions in @xmath20 gauge theories reduce to the corresponding calculations in the parent @xmath5 _ oriented _ theory .",
    "this holds not only for finite ( in the large @xmath1 limit ) gauge theories but also for the gauge theories which are not conformal .",
    "we will prove that certain @xmath21 gauge theories obtained this way are superconformal to all orders in perturbation theory in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "we will also discuss possible extensions to non - supersymmetric cases .",
    "it is very satisfying to observe that in the large @xmath1 limit using the power of string theory perturbation techniques we can reduce very non - trivial calculations in gauge theories with lower supersymmetries to calculations in @xmath5 gauge theories .",
    "in particular , this applies to multi - point correlators in gauge theory .",
    "here we note that the correspondence between ",
    "t hooft s large @xmath1 expansion and string world - sheet expansion is expected to hold only in the regime where the effective coupling @xmath17 is small .",
    "if @xmath17 is large one expects an effective supergravity description to take over .",
    "this domain has been recently studied in several papers @xcite as well as in various related works @xcite .",
    "the supergravity picture has , in particular , led to the conjectures in @xcite as well as in @xcite about finiteness of certain gauge theories .",
    "however , proofs of those conjectures ( in the large @xmath1 limit ) presented in @xcite were given in the _ weakly _ coupled region .",
    "also , @xmath22 corrections can only be reliably computed in this region but not in the strong coupling regime where _ a priori _ there is no world - sheet expansion nor ",
    "t hooft s expansion is valid .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the arguments of @xcite for the cases without the orientifold planes . in section",
    "iii we generalize these arguments to the orientifold cases . in particular , we prove various vanishing theorems in the large @xmath1 limit , and give the relation between various correlators in @xmath20 gauge theories to those in the parent @xmath5 theory . in section",
    "iv we construct some explicit @xmath23 examples .",
    "all of these examples turn out to be superconformal .",
    "in section v we construct an example of @xmath21 gauge theory with @xmath24 gauge group . this gauge theory is superconformal in the large @xmath1 limit to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we also discuss some examples of non - finite @xmath21 gauge theories .",
    "in this section we review the discussion in @xcite for the cases without orientifold planes .",
    "we will generalize these arguments to the orientifold cases in section [ finite1 ] .      consider type iib string theory with @xmath1 parallel d3-branes where the space transverse to the d - branes is @xmath25 .",
    "the orbifold group @xmath26 . if @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , we have @xmath21 ( @xmath23 ) unbroken supersymmetry , and @xmath3 , otherwise .",
    "let us confine our attention to the cases where type iib on @xmath29 is a modular invariant theory",
    ". for the non - supersymmetric cases this is also true provided that @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 , then modular invariance requires that the set of points in @xmath32 fixed under the @xmath33 twist has real dimension 2 . ] .",
    "the action of the orbifold on the coordinates @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) on @xmath29 can be described in terms of @xmath36 matrices : @xmath37 .",
    "we need to specify the action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton charges carried by the d3-branes .",
    "it is described by @xmath38 matrices @xmath39 that form a representation of @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath41 is an identity matrix and @xmath42 .",
    "the d - brane sector of the theory is described by an _ oriented _",
    "open string theory .",
    "in particular , the world - sheet expansion corresponds to summing over oriented riemann surfaces with arbitrary genus @xmath13 and arbitrary number of boundaries @xmath12 , where the boundaries of the world - sheet correspond to the d3-branes .",
    "for example , consider one - loop vacuum amplitude ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "the corresponding graph is an annulus whose boundaries lie on d3-branes .",
    "the one - loop partition function in the light - cone gauge is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fermion number operator , @xmath47 is the real modular parameter of the annulus , and the trace includes sum over the chan - paton factors .",
    "the orbifold group @xmath40 acts on both ends of the open strings .",
    "the action of @xmath48 on chan - paton charges is given by @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the individual terms in the sum in ( [ partition ] ) have the following form : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are characters corresponding to the world - sheet degrees of freedom .",
    "the `` untwisted '' character @xmath52 is the same as in the @xmath5 theory for which @xmath53 .",
    "the information about the fact that the orbifold theory has reduced supersymmetry is encoded in the `` twisted '' characters @xmath51 , @xmath54 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the one - loop massless ( and , in non - supersymmetric cases , tachyonic ) tadpole cancellation conditions require that @xmath55 it was also shown that this condition implies that the chan - paton matrices @xmath39 form an @xmath56-fold copy of the _ regular _ representation of @xmath40 .",
    "the regular representation decomposes into a direct sum of all irreducible representations @xmath57 of @xmath40 with degeneracy factors @xmath58 .",
    "the gauge group is ( @xmath59 ) @xmath60 the matter consists of weyl fermions ( and scalars ) transforming in bi - fundamentals @xmath61 according to the decomposition of the tensor product of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) of @xmath64 with the corresponding representation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the gauge group in the theories we are considering here is @xmath65 . in the following",
    "we will ignore the @xmath66 factors ( for which the gauge couplings do run for @xmath20 as there are matter fields charged under them ) and consider @xmath67 . in this subsection",
    "we review the arguments of @xcite which show that in the large @xmath1 limit this non - abelian gauge theory is conformal factors does not alter the conclusions as their effect is subleading in the @xmath22 expansion @xcite . ] .",
    "there are two classes of diagrams we need to consider : ( _ i _ ) diagrams without handles ; ( _ ii _ ) diagrams with handles . the latter correspond to closed string loops and are subleading in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the diagrams without handles can be divided into two classes : ( _ i _ ) planar diagrams where all the external lines are attached to the same boundary ; ( _ ii _ ) non - planar diagrams where the external lines are attached to at least two different boundaries .",
    "the latter are subleading in the large @xmath1 limit .    in the case of planar diagrams we have @xmath12 boundaries with all @xmath4 external lines attached to the same boundary ( which without loss of generality can be chosen to be the outer boundary ) as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "we need to sum over all possible twisted boundary conditions for the boundaries .",
    "the boundary conditions must satisfy the requirement that @xmath68 where @xmath69 corresponds to the outer boundary ( to which we have attached the external lines ) , and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) correspond to the inner boundaries ( with no external lines ) .",
    "here we have chosen the convention ( consistent with the corresponding choice made for the annulus amplitude in ( [ partition ] ) ) that the outer and inner boundaries have opposite orientations .",
    "then the above condition is simply the statement that only the states invariant under the action of the orbifold group contribute into the amplitude .    if all the twisted boundary conditions are trivial ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath72 for all @xmath73 ) then the corresponding amplitude is the same as in the @xmath74 case ( modulo factors of @xmath75 coming from the difference in normalizations of the corresponding d - brane boundary states in the cases with @xmath5 ( where @xmath76 ) and @xmath20 ( where @xmath77 ) ) .",
    "therefore , such amplitudes do not contribute to the gauge coupling running ( for which we would have @xmath78 gauge bosons attached to the outer boundary ) since the latter is not renormalized in @xmath5 gauge theories due to supersymmetry .",
    "let us now consider contributions with non - trivial twisted boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath79 , @xmath80 , be the chan - paton matrices corresponding to the external lines .",
    "then the planar diagram with @xmath12 boundaries has the following chan - paton group - theoretic dependence : @xmath81 where the sum involves all possible distributions of @xmath70 twists ( that satisfy the condition ( [ mono ] ) ) as well as permutations of @xmath79 factors ( note that the @xmath17 s here are the states which are kept after the orbifold projection , and so they commute with the action of @xmath82 s ) . the important point here",
    "is that unless all twists @xmath70 are trivial for @xmath71 , the above diagram vanishes by the virtue of ( [ pole ] ) .",
    "but then from ( [ mono ] ) it follows that @xmath69 must be trivial as well .",
    "this implies that the only planar diagrams that contribute are those with trivial boundary conditions which ( up to numerical factors ) are the same as in the parent @xmath5 gauge theory .",
    "this establishes that computation of any @xmath4-point correlation faction in the large @xmath1 limit reduces to the corresponding @xmath5 calculation , and that these gauge theories are ( super)conformal in this limit .",
    "here we should mention that the models of @xcite are perturbatively consistent string theories at all energy scales .",
    "in particular , the abelian factors ( that run in the low energy effective theory and decouple in the infrared ) are not problematic from the string theory viewpoint ( although in the field theory context they would have landau poles in the ultraviolet ) .",
    "in this section we generalize the approach of @xcite to theories with orientifold planes . here",
    "we will mostly concentrate on supersymmetric cases , and briefly discuss possible generalizations to non - supersymmetric cases at the end of this section .      consider type iib string theory on @xmath83 where @xmath27 so that the resulting theory has some number of unbroken supersymmetries . consider the @xmath84 orientifold of this theory , where @xmath85 is the world - sheet parity reversal , and",
    "@xmath86 is a @xmath33 element ( @xmath87 ) acting on the complex coordinates @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) on @xmath90 such that the set of points in @xmath90 fixed under the action of @xmath86 has real dimension @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath91 then we have an orientifold 3-plane .",
    "if @xmath40 has a @xmath33 subgroup , then we also have an orientifold 7-plane .",
    "if @xmath93 then we have an orientifold 7-plane .",
    "we may also have an orientifold 3-plane depending on whether @xmath40 has an appropriate @xmath33 subgroup . regardless of whether we have an orientifold 3-plane , we can _ a priori _ introduce an arbitrary number of d3-branes ( as the corresponding tadpoles vanish due to the fact that the space transverse to the d3-branes is non - compact ) . on the other hand , if we have an orientifold 7-plane we must introduce 8 of the corresponding d7-branes to cancel the r - r charge appropriately .",
    "( the number 8 of d7-branes is required by the corresponding tadpole cancellation conditions . )",
    "we need to specify the action of @xmath40 on the chan - paton factors corresponding to the d3- and/or d7-branes . just as in the previous section ,",
    "these are given by chan - paton matrices which we collectively refer to as @xmath94 , where the superscript @xmath95 refers to the corresponding d3- or d7-branes .",
    "note that @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of d - branes labelled by @xmath95 .",
    "at one - loop level there are three different sources for massless tadpoles : the klein bottle , annulus , and mbius strip amplitudes depicted in fig.2 .",
    "the klein bottle amplitude corresponds to the contribution of unoriented closed strings into one - loop vacuum diagram .",
    "it can be alternatively viewed as a tree - level closed string amplitude where the closed strings propagate between two cross - caps .",
    "the latter are ( coherent type iib ) states that describe the familiar orientifold planes .",
    "the annulus amplitude corresponds to the contribution of open strings stretched between two d - branes into one - loop vacuum amplitude .",
    "it can also be viewed as a tree - channel closed string amplitude where the closed strings propagate between two d - branes .",
    "finally , the mbius strip amplitude corresponds to the contribution of unoriented open strings into one - loop vacuum diagram .",
    "it can be viewed as a tree - channel closed string amplitude where the closed strings propagate between a d - brane and an orientifold plane .",
    "note that there are no chan - paton matrices associated with the klein bottle amplitude since it corresponds to closed strings propagating between two cross - caps which do not carry chan - paton charges .",
    "the mbius strip has only one boundary .",
    "this implies that the individual terms ( corresponding to twists @xmath48 ) in the mbius strip amplitude are proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "the annulus amplitude is the same ( up to an overall factor of @xmath99 due to the orientation reversal projection ) as in the oriented case discussed in the previous section .",
    "thus , the individual terms ( corresponding to twists @xmath48 ) in the annulus amplitude are proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the tadpoles can be written as @xmath101 here terms with @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 correspond to the contributions of the klein bottle , mbius strip and annulus amplitudes , respectively .",
    "in fact , the factorization property of string theory implies that the klein bottle amplitude should factorize into two cross - caps connected via a long thin tube .",
    "the mbius strip amplitude should factorize into a cross - cap and a disc connected via a long thin tube .",
    "similarly , the annulus amplitude should factorize into two discs connected via a long thin tube .",
    "these factorizations are depicted in fig.3 .",
    "the implication of this for the tadpoles is that they too factorize into a sum of perfect squares @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the tadpole cancellation conditions read : @xmath109 note that @xmath110 in the next subsection we will see that if this condition is satisfied then the corresponding ( non - abelian ) gauge theories are superconformal in the large @xmath1 limit . on the other hand , if not all @xmath102 with @xmath54 are zero , then some of the chan - paton matrices @xmath94 with @xmath54 must have non - zero traces .",
    "this will generically lead to theories with non - vanishing one - loop @xmath6-functions .",
    "in this subsection we extend the arguments reviewed in section [ finite ] to the cases with orientifold planes .",
    "in particular , we will study the large @xmath1 behavior of @xmath4-point correlators of fields charged under the gauge group that arises from the d3-branes . in the following",
    "we will ignore the @xmath66 factors ( if any ) in the d3-brane gauge group .",
    "there are two classes of diagrams we need to consider : ( _ i _ ) diagrams without handles and cross - caps ; ( _ ii _ ) diagrams with handles and/or cross - caps .",
    "the latter are subleading in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the diagrams without handles and cross - caps can be divided into two classes : ( _ i _ ) planar diagrams where all the external lines are attached to the same boundary ; ( _ ii _ ) non - planar diagrams where the external lines are attached to at least two different boundaries .",
    "the latter are subleading in the large @xmath1 limit .    in the case of planar diagrams we have @xmath12 boundaries corresponding to d3- and/or d7-branes",
    ". we will attach @xmath4 external lines to the outer boundary as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "we need to sum over all possible twisted boundary conditions for the boundaries .",
    "the boundary conditions must satisfy the requirement that @xmath111 where @xmath112 corresponds to the outer boundary , and @xmath113 ( @xmath71 ) correspond to the inner boundaries .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath5 theories for which the orbifold group @xmath40 is trivial .",
    "( note that in this case we can only have d3-branes as introduction of d7-branes would break some number of supersymmetries . )",
    "the computation of any correlation function in the orientifold theory ( with @xmath114 or @xmath24 gauge group ) is reduced to the corresponding computation in the oriented @xmath5 theory ( with @xmath115 gauge group ) up to factors of @xmath116 ( coming from the difference in normalizations of the corresponding d - brane boundary states in the oriented and unoriented cases ) .",
    "such a simplification is due to the fact that the unoriented world - sheets with cross - caps give contributions suppressed by extra powers of @xmath22 .",
    "next , consider cases where @xmath40 is non - trivial ( and hence supersymmetry is reduced ) . if all the twisted boundary conditions are trivial ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath72 for all @xmath73 ) then the corresponding amplitude is the same as in the @xmath74 case ( modulo factors of @xmath75 ) .",
    "therefore , such amplitudes do not contribute to the gauge coupling running ( for which we would have @xmath78 gauge bosons attached to the outer boundary ) since the latter is not renormalized in @xmath5 gauge theories due to supersymmetry .",
    "let us now consider contributions with non - trivial twisted boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath79 , @xmath80 , be the chan - paton matrices corresponding to the external lines .",
    "then the planar diagram with @xmath12 boundaries has the following chan - paton group - theoretic dependence : @xmath117 where the sum involves all possible distributions of @xmath70 twists ( that satisfy the condition ( [ mono ] ) ) as well as permutations of @xmath79 factors . if the condition ( [ klein ] ) is satisfied , _ i.e. _ , if all the twisted chan - paton matrices are traceless , then the situation is analogous to that in the oriented cases .",
    "that is , the only planar diagrams that contribute are those with trivial boundary conditions .",
    "such diagrams with all the boundaries corresponding to d3-branes ( up to numerical factors ) are the same as in the parent @xmath5 gauge theory .",
    "the diagrams with trivial boundary conditions but with some boundaries corresponding to d7-branes are subleading in the large @xmath1 limit as the numbers of d7-branes ( that is , the traces @xmath118 corresponding to d7-branes ) are of order one .",
    "this establishes that computation of any @xmath4-point correlation faction in the large @xmath1 limit reduces to the corresponding @xmath5 calculation in _ oriented _ theory , and that these gauge theories are superconformal in this limit .",
    "now consider the cases where some of the twisted chan - paton matrices are _ not _ traceless .",
    "then there are going to be corrections to the @xmath4-point correlators coming from planar diagrams with non - trivial twisted boundary conditions .",
    "these diagrams are subleading in the large @xmath1 limit as the corresponding traces are always of order one .",
    "this follows from the tadpole cancellation conditions ( [ tad ] ) where the coefficients @xmath119 and @xmath120 are of order one , so for @xmath54 we have @xmath121 .",
    "this implies that even for non - finite theories computation of the correlation functions reduces to the corresponding computation in the parent @xmath5 oriented theory .",
    "here we should point out that `` non - finiteness '' of such theories is a subleading effect in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "this is because the @xmath6-function coefficients grow as @xmath122 instead of @xmath123 ( as in , say , pure @xmath124 gauge theory ) .",
    "this can be seen by considering planar diagrams with @xmath78 external lines corresponding to gauge bosons .",
    "note that in string theory running of the gauge couplings in the low energy effective field theory is due to infrared divergences corresponding to massless modes @xcite .",
    "the diagrams with all the boundaries corresponding to d3-branes and with all the boundary conditions corresponding to the identity element of @xmath40 are the same ( up to overall numerical factors ) as in the parent @xmath5 theory . such diagrams , therefore , do not contain infrared divergencies , and thus do not contribute the gauge coupling running .",
    "( that is , their contributions to the @xmath6-function coefficients @xmath125 vanish . )",
    "therefore , the only diagrams that can contribute to the @xmath6-function coefficients @xmath125 are those with some boundaries corresponding to d7-branes and/or having twisted boundary conditions with @xmath126 .",
    "these are , however , suppressed at least by one power of @xmath1 since the numbers of d7-branes are of order one , and also such @xmath121 .",
    "this establishes ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "note that the estimates for the @xmath6-function coefficients in ( [ beta ] ) for @xmath127 are non - trivial from the field theory point of view as they imply infinitely many cancellations between couplings ( such as yukawas ) in the gauge theory . on the other hand , within string perturbation expansion",
    "these statements become obvious once we carefully consider twisted boundary conditions and tadpole cancellation .      here",
    "we would like to comment on some issues concerning the discussion in the previous subsections .",
    "first , note that the entire argument in the previous subsection crucially depends on the assumption that there is a well defined world - sheet description of the orientifold theories at hand .",
    "naively , it might seem that orientifolds of type iib on @xmath128 should have such world - sheet descriptions for any @xmath40 which is a subgroup of @xmath64 .",
    "this is , however , not the case @xcite . in particular , there are certain cases where perturbative description is inadequate as there are additional states present in the corresponding orientifolds such that they are non - perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint @xcite . in section [ n1 ]",
    "we will give an explicit example of this .",
    "for further details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the second comment is on possible extensions of the above results to @xmath3 theories .",
    "note that in the cases without orientifold planes @xcite the tadpole cancellation conditions for both @xmath3 and supersymmetric theories are given by ( [ pole ] ) for which there always exists a solution for any choice of @xmath40 .",
    "the situation in the cases with orientifold planes might not be so simple : the tadpoles are of the form ( [ kma ] ) , and the coefficients @xmath129 may be different for the massless and tachyonic tadpoles .",
    "( the latter are absent in the supersymmetric cases but are generically present for @xmath3 . )",
    "it is _ a priori _ unclear whether the massless and tachyonic tadpole cancellation conditions are compatible .",
    "however , if they have a solution in a given model , then the statements about the correlation functions in subsection b persist for such @xmath3 models in the large @xmath1 limit . it would therefore be interesting to construct @xmath3 models in which all the tadpoles cancel .",
    "in this section we construct four dimensional @xmath23 superconformal gauge theories form type iib orientifolds .",
    "we start from type iib string theory on @xmath29= @xmath128 , where @xmath130 is the orbifold group whose action on the complex coordinates @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) on @xmath90 is given by @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "next , we consider an orientifold of this theory where the orientifold action is given by @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 is the world - sheet parity reversal , and @xmath86 acts on @xmath88 as @xmath135 .",
    "the orientifold group is given by @xmath136 .",

    "thus , it might appear surprising that they are still finite . apparently , some subtle cancellation has taken place in these models supersymmetry . ] .",
    "we can understand the origin of this `` accidental '' cancellation in the light of recent results obtained in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the six dimensional orientifold of type iib on @xmath197 is on the same moduli as the orientifold of type iib on @xmath198 with an ( untwisted ) ns - ns antisymmetric tensor background .",
    "the twisted sector chan - paton matrices in the @xmath33 model are traceless ( for turning on the untwisted ns - ns @xmath199-field does not affect the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions @xcite ) . since the four dimensional orientifolds we are considering here are related to the six dimensional ones ( upon compactifying on @xmath200 , t - dualizing and taking the dimensions of the dual @xmath160 to infinity ) , it is not surprising that the @xmath194 model is finite ( that is , this explains the `` accidental '' cancellation mentioned above ) .",
    "the finiteness of the @xmath195 model then follows as @xmath201 , and the @xmath33 model is finite due to tracelessness of the twisted chan - paton matrices .",
    "here we should mention that there are other @xmath23 models which are not superconformal .",
    "one way of constructing such models is to consider the @xmath202 orientifold of type iib on @xmath83 , where @xmath203 has odd order ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "note that in these models there is an orientifold 7-plane ( which requires presence of 8 d7-branes ) but no orientifold 3-plane .",
    "nonetheless , we can introduce an arbitrary number of d3-branes .",
    "the gauge group coming from the d3-branes is ( generically ) a product of unitary subgroups , and contains bi - fundamental matter just as in @xcite .",
    "however , there is additional matter coming from the 37 open string sector ( which gives fundamentals in the 33 gauge group which also transform as fundamentals under the 77 gauge group ) .",
    "the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions are given by ( [ odd ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to show that in these models ( the non - abelian part of ) the 33 gauge theory is not superconformal ( and , in particular , the corresponding one - loop @xmath6-functions are non - vanishing ) .",
    "note that this is in accord with expectations in section [ finite1 ] .",
    "( the `` accidental '' finiteness of the gauge theories discussed in the previous subsections is therefore a special feature of those models . )",
    "it would be interesting to study these non - finite gauge theories further in the present string theory framework for they may bring additional insight relevant for understanding more general non - conformal gauge theories .",
