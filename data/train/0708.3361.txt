    "the disadvantage of the realistic dft - calculations come from their strong material dependence  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they do not explain the basic physics of disordered local - moment systems in a simple way .",
    "but , it is known that a disordered klm hamiltonian can be mapped onto an random heisenberg model(shown in the text ) , so , in this respect better results can be obtained from its model study .    a special challenge when treating the random kondo - lattice model arises with the fact that both the electron and the spin subsystem have to be considered simultaneously and on the same level .",
    "most of the klm investigations are focused on the electronic @xcite or magnetic  @xcite subsystem only .",
    "a special goal of our study is the homologous treatment of the electronic and magnetic properties of the random klm , which mutually effect each other and , therefore , should be determined self - consistently .    nevertheless , we are forced to apply different methods to study the influence of the disorder and dilution of the magnetic moments subsystem on the properties of these two aforementioned subsystems . in this paper for the itinerant electron system a proper alloy analogy with the respective coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite is used . for the random spin system ,",
    "for which the situation is not so clear , an equivalent ansatz must be found . as it was done successfully for the periodic klm  @xcite ( @xmath7 ) one can map the klm - interband exchange on an effective and random heisenberg model .",

    "<S> we propose a self - consistent approximate solution of the disordered kondo - lattice model ( klm ) to get the interconnected electronic and magnetic properties of local - moment systems like diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> aiming at @xmath0 compounds , where magnetic ( m ) and non - magnetic ( a ) atoms distributed randomly over a crystal lattice , we present a theory which treats the subsystems of itinerant charge carriers and localized magnetic moments in a homologous manner . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the localized moments due to the itinerant electrons ( holes ) is treated by a modified rkky - theory which maps the klm onto an effective heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange integrals turn out to be functionals of the electronic selfenergy guaranteeing selfconsistency of our theory . </S>",
    "<S> the disordered electronic and magnetic moment systems are both treated by cpa - type methods .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the dependencies of the key - terms such as the long range and oscillating effectice exchange integrals , the local - moment magnetization , the electron spin polarization , the curie temperature as well as the electronic and magnonic quasiparticle densities of states on the concentration @xmath1 of magnetic ions , the carrier concentration @xmath2 , the exchange coupling @xmath3 , and the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the shape and the effective range of the exchange integrals turn out to be strongly @xmath1-dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder causes anomalies in the spin spectrum especially in the low - dilution regime , which are not observed in the mean field approximation . </S>"
