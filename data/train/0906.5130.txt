    "entanglement is one of the most important concepts and resources in quantum information theory .",
    "however , the quantification of the entanglement of a given quantum state is quite difficult except for bipartite pure state , where the distance - like measure of the entanglement ( _ relative entropy of entanglement_)@xcite @xcite and the operational measures of entanglement ( _  entanglement of formation , distillable entanglement _ ) @xciteare all equal to the entropy of the reduced state obtained by tracing out one part of the pure state . in bipartite system ,",
    "apart from pure state , the entanglement of a mixed state is not easy to calculate in general if not impossible .",
    "the situation becomes even worse for multipartite system where the basic states corresponding to bell basis are not clearly recognized @xcite@xcite .",
    "thus the extension of operational entanglement measures to multipartite system is not available .",
    "nevertheless , a variety of different entanglement measure have been proposed for multipartite setting . among them",
    "are the _ ( global ) robustness of entanglement _",
    "@xcite _ _  , _ _ the _ relative entropy of entanglement , _ and _ the geometric measure _ @xcite__. _ _ the robustness measures the minimal noise ( arbitrary state ) that we need to added to make the state separable .",
    "the geometric measure is the distance of state to the closest product state in terms of the fidelity .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement is a valid entanglement measure for multipartite state , it is the relative entropy of the state under consideration to the closest fully separable state .",
    "the quantification of multipartite entanglement is usually very difficult as most measures are defined as the solutions to difficult variational problems . even for pure multipartite state ,",
    "the entanglement can only be obtained for some special scenario .",
    "fortunately , due to the inequality on the logarithmic robustness , relative entropy of entanglement and geometric measure of entanglement@xcite @xcite @xcite , these entanglement measures are all equal for stabilizer states @xcite .",
    "thus for stabilizer state @xmath0 , the entanglement can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the separable pure state .",
    "the entanglement is upper bounded by the local operation and classical communication ( locc ) bound @xmath3 , and lower bounded by some bipartite entanglement deduced from the state , that is , the matching bound @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that all graph states are stabilizer states , so the inequality for the entanglement of a graph state is @xmath5 if the lower bound coincides with the upper bound , the the entanglement of the graph state can be obtained .",
    "this is the case for two - colorable graph states such as multipartite ghz states , steane code , cluster state , and state of ring graph with even vertices . for a state of ring graph with odd @xmath6 vertices",
    ", we have @xmath7 @xcite@xmath8    we in this paper will concern with the entanglement of a graph state whose graph is not  two - colorable  . a new upper bound based directly on the definition of graph state",
    "is proposed .",
    "the symmetry of the graph is utilized to further reduce the upper bounds for some highly symmetric graph states , including the five vertices ring and peterson graph .",
    "a graph @xmath9 is composed of a set @xmath10 of @xmath11 vertices and a set of edges specified by the adjacency matrix @xmath12 , which is an @xmath13 symmetric matrix with vanishing diagonal entries and @xmath14 @xmath15 if vertices @xmath16 are connected and @xmath14 @xmath17 otherwise . the neighborhood of a vertex @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath19 @xmath20 , i.e , the set of all the vertices that are connected to @xmath21 .",
    "graph states @xcite @xcite ] are useful multipartite entangled states that are essential resources for the one - way computing @xcite and can be experimentally demonstrated @xcite@xcite . to associate the graph state to the underlying graph",
    ", we assign each vertex with a qubit , each edge represents the interaction between the corresponding two qubits . more physically , the interaction may be ising interaction of spin qubits .",
    "let us denote the pauli matrices at the qubit @xmath18 by @xmath22 and identity by @xmath23 .",
    "the graph state related to graph @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the joint eigenstate of pauli operators @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) with eigenvalues @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the joint + 1 eigenstate of pauli operators @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 in the @xmath35 basis ) is the controlled phase gate between qubits @xmath18 and @xmath36 .",
    "graph state can also be viewed as the result of successively performing 2-qubit control - z operations @xmath33 to the initially unconnected @xmath11 qubit state @xmath37 .",
    "it can be shown that graph state is the joint @xmath38 eigenstate of the @xmath39 vertices stabilizers @xmath40 meanwhile , the graph state basis are @xmath41 @xmath42 with @xmath43 since all of the graph basis states are local unitary equivalent , they all have equal entanglement , so we only need to determine the entanglement of graph state @xmath44 .",
    "once the entanglement of a graph state is obtained , the entanglement of all the graph basis states are obtained .",
    "the fidelity @xmath45plays a crucial rule in calculating the entanglement . for a graph state , we have @xmath46 denote @xmath47 as the fidelity between the graph state and the closest pure separable state .",
    "one of the ways to obtain the upper bound the entanglement is to relax the maximization . for two - colorable graph ,",
    "the set with majority vertices is colored with amber , the set with minority vertices is colored with blue . without loss of generality",
    ", the amber colored vertices are labelled as @xmath48 the blue vertices are labelled as @xmath49 .",
    "since all amber vertices are not adjacent with each other , we can perform @xmath31 ( @xmath50 ) measurements to all amber qubits simultaneously . and applying @xmath51 ( @xmath49 ) measurements to all blue qubits at the same time .",
    "thus all amber stabilizers @xmath52 can be measured simultaneously by locc .",
    "the maximal number of states that can be discriminated by locc then is @xmath53 according to the theory of graph state basis @xcite .",
    "applying the inequality on the relationship of locc discrimination of states and the entanglement@xcite , one has @xmath54 that is , @xmath55 this upper bound of locc may be extended to graphs that are not two - colorable by some modification .",
    "however , it is possible to obtain the upper bound without the locc state discrimination .",
    "we will obtain the upper bound of the entanglement with the definition of the graph state .",
    "the graph state may not be two - colorable .",
    "suppose the maximal non - adjacent vertices set @xmath56 has @xmath57 vertices .",
    "as before , we label these vertices with @xmath58 .",
    "the other vertices are in the set @xmath59 the vertices are labelled with @xmath60 note that the vertices within set @xmath61 may connect with each other , for the graph may not be two - colorable .",

    "the upper bound of the entanglement is @xmath87 where @xmath57 is the maximal number of non - adjacent vertices of the graph .",
    "note that we obtain the upper bound without the knowledge of locc , and the result can be applied to any graph state .    as an application",
    ", we consider the graph in fig.1 ( a ) .",
    "the stabilizer code based on this graph is [ [ 6,1,3 ] ] quantum error correction code .",
    "the maximal number of non - adjacent vertices of the graph is @xmath88 ( i.e. vertices @xmath89 or vertices @xmath90 ) .",
    "thus we have the entanglement upper bound @xmath91 meanwhile , the lower matching bound @xcite is also @xmath92 this is due to the fact that multipartite entanglement is no less than the corresponding bipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath93 the lower bound @xmath4 is obtained with a bipartition of the graph into subgraph @xmath94 and @xmath95with @xmath96 and @xmath97 removing the local edges in both parties by local control - z operations , we obtain @xmath88 bell pairs between the two parties .",
    "so @xmath98 the detail process is to apply @xmath99 and @xmath100 operations which are local in subgraph @xmath101 , and apply @xmath102 operation which is local in subgraph @xmath103 the edges of the remain graph are @xmath104 and @xmath105 the upper bound and the lower bound coincide , thus the entanglement of the graph state is @xmath88 .",
    "for a graph state of a ring graph with odd @xmath11 vertices , we have @xmath106 the upper bound is obtained by locc and also by our non - adjacent vertices set method .",
    "we will show that this upper bound can be further improved for five vertices ring graph state by making use of the symmetry of the graph .",
    "our symmetrical consideration also shows that the peterson graph @xcite state has entanglement upper bound of @xmath107 , while locc and non - adjacent vertices set method can only give the upper bound of @xmath108 .      the graph of five vertices ring is the underlying graph of the famous [ [ 5,1,3 ] ] stabilizer code .",
