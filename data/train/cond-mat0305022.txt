    "the universal features of fermi liquids and their physical consequences continue to attract the attention of the condensed - matter community for almost 50 years after the fermi - liquid theory was developed by landau  @xcite . a search for stability conditions of a fermi liquid and deviations from a fermi - liquid behavior  @xcite , particularly near quantum critical points , intensified in recent years mostly due to the non - fermi - liquid features of the normal state of high @xmath13 superconductors  @xcite and other materials .    in a generic fermi liquid ,",
    "the imaginary part of the retarded fermionic self - energy @xmath14 on the mass shell is determined solely by fermions in a narrow @xmath15 ) energy range around the fermi surface and behaves as  @xcite @xmath16 simultaneously , the real part of the self - energy scales as @xmath17 , at small energies ( kramers - kronig relations relate constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 via an ultraviolet energy cutoff @xmath20 ) . a regular form of the self - energy has a profound effect on observable quantities such as the specific heat and static spin and charge susceptibilities , which have the same functional dependences as for free fermions , e.g. , specific heat @xmath21 is linear in @xmath22 , while the susceptibilities @xmath23 and @xmath24 both approach constant values at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a regular behavior of the fermionic self - energy is also in line with a general reasoning that turning on the interaction in @xmath27 should not affect drastically the low - energy properties of an electronic system , unless special circumstances , e.g. , proximity to a quantum phase transition , interfere  @xcite .",
    "the subject of this paper is the analysis of the non - analytic , _ universal _ corrections to the fermi - liquid behavior that should be present in a generic fermi liquid .",
    "it has been known for some time that the subleading terms in the @xmath28 and @xmath8 expansions of the fermionic self - energy do not form regular , analytic series in @xmath29 or @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath31 , etc . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , etc . for @xmath34 )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xmath35 , the power counting shows the first subleading term in the ( retarded ) on - shell self - energy at @xmath26 is  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is real . for a generic @xmath38",
    ", this subleading term behaves as @xmath39 . in 2d , it is again logarithmic   @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is real . from a formal perspective",
    ", the @xmath42 form of the correction term in 2d implies that at @xmath43 it dominates over a fermi - liquid , @xmath29 -term , i.e. , a conventional fermi - liquid reasoning breaks down .",
    "this is true also for @xmath44 , as the correction term scales again as @xmath39 .",
    "however , as long as @xmath27 , @xmath45 is asymptotically larger at low frequencies than @xmath46 , i.e. , fermionic excitations remain well - defined . for a complete set of references on this problem see ref .",

    "belitz , kirkpatrick and vojta ( bkv ) argued  @xcite that the singularity in the fermionic self - energy should also affect spin susceptibility and give rise to a singular momentum expansion of the static @xmath55 .",
    "a similar idea was expressed by misawa  @xcite . indeed , the susceptibility is a convolution of the two fermionic green s functions ( a particle - hole bubble ) . for non - interacting fermions , @xmath56",
    "is given by the lindhard function which is analytic in @xmath3 for small @xmath3 in all @xmath57 .",
    "the corrections to the lindhard form are obtained by self - energy and vertex - correction insertions into the particle - hole bubble ( see fig . [",
    "fig : diag ] ) . the diagrams with self - energy insertions can be viewed as convolutions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "substituting the self - energy and expanding in @xmath61 and in @xmath3 , we obtain @xmath62 substituting the singular part of @xmath63 into ( [ i2 ] ) and just counting powers , we find @xmath64 for @xmath35 , and @xmath65 for smaller @xmath57 .",
    "( for @xmath66 , a more accurate estimate yields @xmath67 ) .",
    "to verify this reasoning , bkv explicitly computed @xmath68 in 3d to second order in the interaction , and indeed demonstrated  @xcite that @xmath64 , in agreement with power counting . based on this agreement ,",
    "bkv conjectured that power counting should be valid for all @xmath27 , i.e. , the fully renormalized spin susceptibility should scale with momenta as @xmath4 .    another non - analytic behavior was discovered in the analysis of the temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility in @xmath69 .",
    "baranov , kagan and marenko ( bkm )  @xcite estimated @xmath70 using a relation between the uniform susceptibility and the quasiparticle interaction function  @xcite , and argued that @xmath71 is linear in @xmath22 in 2d .",
    "chitov and millis ( cm ) @xcite later used the same approach , but went beyond estimates and performed a detailed analysis of the quasiparticle interaction function and the susceptibility .",
    "they also found a linear - in-@xmath22 dependence .",
    "another example of non - analyticity in the leading corrections to a fermi - liquid behavior is linear - in-@xmath22 corrections to the impurity scattering time in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "a general treatment of this situation @xcite shows that the correction to the residual conductivity of a dirty fermi liquid depends linearly on the temperature in the ballistic regime , i.e. , when @xmath22 is much larger than the level width due to impurity scattering . unlike the familiar @xmath72 -dependence of the conductivity in the diffusive regime @xcite",
    ", this linear @xmath8 dependence originates from the singular behavior of the response functions of a clean fermi liquid in 2d .",
    "our intension to pursue a further study on singular corrections to the fermi - liquid behavior is stimulated by several factors .",
    "first , we want to clarify what actually causes the singularities in the fermionic self - energy , specific heat and spin susceptibility .",
    "to illustrate the importance of understanding this issue , we note that power counting arguments are not rigorous and can lead to incorrect results .",
    "indeed , let s apply power counting to the susceptibility of noninteracting fermions , which , we know , is a lindhard function .",
    "each green s function of free fermions @xmath73^{-1}$ ] scales as one inverse power of momentum and energy ( the corresponding dynamical exponent @xmath74 ) , so the convolution of the two green s functions contributes two powers of @xmath75 in the denominator of the integrand for @xmath76 . expanding up to @xmath77 ,",
    "one then adds two extra powers .",
    "the frequency integration eliminates one , so there are three powers of momentum left in the denominator .",
    "the prefactor for @xmath77 should then scale as @xmath78 where @xmath79 the lower limit of the integration is of order @xmath3 , the upper limit is of order @xmath80 .",
    "the integral is infrared divergent for @xmath81 , scales as @xmath82 for @xmath35 , as @xmath83 for @xmath84 , and as @xmath85 for @xmath66 .",
    "we see that a power counting predicts a singular momentum dependence of the lindhard function .",
    "the true lindhard function obviously does not obey this behavior  it is analytic near @xmath25 for all @xmath57 . in 3d",
    "@xcite , @xmath86 where @xmath87 . in 2d",
    ", it is just a constant for @xmath88  @xcite , @xmath89 where @xmath90 . in 1d @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "the failure of power counting arguments to reproduce the behavior of the lindhard function clearly calls for understanding under which conditions they do work .",
    "the same problem holds also for the self - energy , as the singular forms of eqs .",
    "( [ ya ] ) and ( [ ya1 ] ) are obtained by power counting , and there is no guarantee that the coefficients are nonzero .",
    "in fact , cm computed the leading correction to the real part of the self - energy in 2d and argued that it _ vanishes_. this would imply that the coefficient @xmath41 in ( [ ya1 ] ) vanishes , and thus the @xmath93 in @xmath94 is absent",
    ". our result will be different ( see below ) - we will find that @xmath41 is finite .",
    "another reason to look more deeply into the physics of singularities is the discrepancy between momentum and temperature dependences of the susceptibility .",
    "the fact that dynamical exponent @xmath74 would normally imply that a non - analytic dependence @xmath95 should be paralleled by a non - analytic dependence of @xmath96 . in 3d , this analogy would mean that @xmath97 .",
    "misawa @xcite did find a @xmath98 term in his calculations in early 70s .",
    "later carneiro and pethick   @xcite , and recently bkv  @xcite argued that the @xmath98 term is actually absent in 3d .",
    "several explanations have been put forward to explain this discrepancy .",
    "bkv suggested that the absence of the @xmath98 dependence in 3d is accidental and should not be regarded as a failure of power counting arguments .",
    "they conjectured that for a generic @xmath99 , the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath71 should hold .",
    "this conjecture was verified numerically by hirashima and takahashi  @xcite for @xmath100 , but no definite conclusion has been drawn because of numerical difficulties .",
    "as we already said , bkm  @xcite and cm @xcite considered @xmath101 in 2d analytically and argued that the linear - in-@xmath22 term is present .",
    "both groups argued that @xmath102 comes from @xmath103 effects ( our results are in full agreement with this ) .",
    "bkm also argued that a @xmath8 dependence is caused by the singular behavior of the quasiparticle interaction function for fermions away from the fermi surface ( in equivalent diagrammatic language - by the singular frequency dependence of the particle hole bubble near @xmath103 ) .",
    "cm found that the linear - in-@xmath22 behavior is caused not only by this effect , but also by the non - analytic temperature behavior of the quasiparticle interaction function for fermions at the fermi surface ( in diagrammatic language , by the singular @xmath22 dependence of the static particle - hole near @xmath103 ) .",
    "the relation between the singularity in the particle hole bubble and non - analyticity of @xmath71 follows from the fact that a generic diagram for for the correction to a fermi - liquid susceptibility , e.g. , diagram 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] , contains a combination @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the fermionic propagator . at @xmath26 ,",
    "a static particle - hole polarization bubble @xmath106 in @xmath100 has an asymmetric square root singularity at @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "a finite @xmath22 or finite @xmath108 soften the singularity and yield @xmath109 in the momentum range @xmath110  @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation shows that fermions which contribute to @xmath111 have energies of order @xmath112 and are located in a narrow angular range where the angle @xmath113 between vectors @xmath114 and @xmath115 is almost @xmath116 @xmath117 . using this and assembling the powers , one obtains that @xmath118    in 3d , an analogous reasoning yields the @xmath98 behavior .",
    "cm suggested   @xcite that previous computations in 3d might have missed the crucial @xmath103 effects and hinted that misawa may be right in that the @xmath98 term may actually be present in 3d .    in the present communication ,",
    "we analyze in detail the physical origin of the non - analytic corrections to the fermi liquid and clarify the discrepancy between earlier papers .",
    "we obtain explicit results in @xmath100 for the fermionic self - energy , the effective mass , the specific heat , and for spin and charge susceptibilities at finite @xmath3 and @xmath26 , and at finite @xmath22 and @xmath25 .",
    "we also verify earlier results for @xmath35 .",
    "we argue that a proper treatment of non - analyticities in the fermionic self - energy and in @xmath56 requires the knowledge of the _ dynamical _ particle - hole response function .",
    "we show explicitly that the non - analyticity in the static lindhard function near @xmath103 does not give rise to a non - analytic behavior of the self - energy due to extra cancelations . for the spin susceptibility , the computation with the static lindhard function does yield linear in @xmath119 and @xmath22-terms , due to @xmath103 effects , but with incorrect prefactors .",
    "we also demonstrate that non - analytic terms in the self - energy and the spin susceptibility can be viewed equivalently as coming either from the non - analyticity in the dynamical particle - hole bubble near @xmath5 , _ or _",
    "@xmath120 , _ or _ from the non - analyticity in the dynamical particle - particle bubble near zero total momentum",
    ". our results do agree with that of bkv who formally considered only @xmath5 contributions .",
    "however , we show explicitly that they indeed computed all possible non - analytic contributions to the static susceptibility , including @xmath103 effects , but just used an unconventional labeling of internal momenta in the diagrams . as an essential step beyond the bkv work ,",
    "we show explicitly that the non - analytic terms in all diagrams for @xmath56 come exclusively from the vertices in which the transferred momentum is either @xmath121 or @xmath103 , and _ simultaneously _ the total momentum is @xmath122 there are only such vertices .",
    "they can be viewed as two parts of the scattering amplitude with zero momentum transfer _ and _ zero total momentum : @xmath123 this restriction to just one scattering amplitude is rather non - trivial , as it implies that non - analytic terms in all diagrams for the susceptibility depend only on @xmath124 and @xmath125 but not on averaged interactions over the fermi surface , as in the bkv analysis .",
    "a similar result has been obtained recently for the conductivity in the ballistic regime in 2d@xcite : for a short - range interaction , the conductivity has a non - analytic @xmath8 dependent piece , whose prefactor depends only on @xmath124 and @xmath125 rather than on the interaction averaged over the fermi surface .",
    "some of the results and conclusions of this paper have recently been announced in a short communication @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review three known non - analyticities in the response functions of a fermi liquid . in the next four sessions we consider a fermionic system with a contact , i.e. , @xmath126independent interaction . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the leading corrections to the self - energy for interacting fermions in 2d .",
    "we show that the on - shell self - energy has the form of eq .",
    "( [ ya1 ] ) with a nonzero @xmath41 , and this gives rise to a linear - in-@xmath22 correction to the effective mass , and to @xmath30 correction to the specific heat .",
    "we show that a correction to the effective mass is not observable in a magneto - oscillations experiment due to a peculiar cancelation between two @xmath8 dependent terms in the self - energy .",
    "we also briefly discuss self - energy corrections for @xmath35 .    in sec .",
    "iv - vi we consider in detail a non - analytic perturbation theory for the charge- and spin - susceptibilities .",
    "we use the self - energy calculated in sec .",
    "ii along with the dynamical lindhard functions near @xmath5 and @xmath120 and the dynamical particle - hole bubble near the zero total momentum as building blocks , and obtain analytic expressions for charge- and spin - susceptibilities . more specifically , in sec .",
    "iv we present , for completeness , the expressions for the spin susceptibility of noninteracting fermions ( the lindhard function ) for various @xmath57 . in sec .",
    "v we consider the susceptibility at @xmath26 and finite @xmath3 .",
    "we present the first analytic calculation of @xmath56 in 2d .",
    "we explicitly show that it scales as @xmath119 and compute the prefactor .",
    "these 2d calculations require substantially more effort than in 3d since the internal momenta in the diagrams are all of order @xmath3 , and one can not simply expand in @xmath77 and then cut the infrared divergence of the prefactor by @xmath127 because in @xmath69 the divergence is power law rather than logarithmic .",
    "we then discuss the 3d case for which we reproduce in a novel way the result of bkv that @xmath128 .",
    "we explicitly verify that non - analytic ( @xmath129 terms obtained either via a `` conventional '' approach to treat @xmath130 contributions and the technique invented by bkv are the same .",
    "we also discuss briefly the @xmath131 case .    in sec .",
    "vi we consider the static susceptibility at finite @xmath22 .",
    "we show that in 2d , @xmath71 scales as @xmath22 with a universal prefactor . we also show that the linear - in-@xmath22 dependence come from two effects : from the thermal smearing of the _ static _ lindhard function for particles at the fermi surface , and from the frequency dependence of the dynamical lindhard function ( i.e. , from particles outside the fermi surface ) .",
    "in particular , we show that the linear - in-@xmath22 piece is present in all diagrams for @xmath132 , including the ones for which the momentum transfer in the lindhard function is near @xmath5 ( the linear - in-@xmath22 terms coming from near @xmath5 and @xmath120 are equal ) . near @xmath5 ,",
    "the static lindhard function is analytic , and a linear - in-@xmath22 susceptibility comes entirely from the non - analyticity in the dynamical part of the lindhard function .",
    "bkm considered only the second source of the @xmath133 behavior , cm included both effects .",
    "our result differs by a factor of 2 compared to that of cm  we could not detect the reason for the discrepancy .",
    "we further analyze in detail the physical origin for the linear - in-@xmath22 term in @xmath69 ( and @xmath1 for a general @xmath81 ) , and discuss to which extent it is related to @xmath134 term in @xmath135 .",
    "we show that the physics behind @xmath1 term in @xmath136 and @xmath134 term in @xmath56 is , in fact , different .",
    "we discuss how the non - analytic term in @xmath132 @xmath22 evolves with @xmath57 , and show that for @xmath35 , @xmath137 without an extra logarithmic factor .",
    "this agrees with carneiro and pethick  @xcite and bkv results that @xmath71 in 3d is free from non - analyticities to order @xmath30 .",
    "we also show that although @xmath71 goes smoothly through @xmath100 , the @xmath69 case is still somewhat special .",
    "finally , we analyzed charge susceptibility and found that non - analytic terms in @xmath24 are all cancelled out , i.e. , the first corrections to the fermi - liquid form for the charge susceptibility are all analytic . for a @xmath69 case ,",
    "this result fully agrees with cm .    in sec .",
    "vii we consider the case of a finite - range interaction with @xmath126dependent @xmath138 .",
    "we demonstrate that non - analytic terms appear in a way similar to anomalies in quantum field theory , and depend _ only _ on @xmath139 and @xmath125 , not on the momentum - averaged interaction .",
    "we show that at both @xmath26 and finite @xmath22 , the non - analytic correction to the self - energy depends on @xmath140 , while the total non - analytic correction to @xmath141 depends only on @xmath142 .",
    "we show that the charge susceptibility does not have a non - trivial @xmath3 dependence  all non - analytic terms from individual diagrams cancel out even when @xmath143 .    in sec .",
    "viii we present our conclusions .",
    "appendices a - d show details of some calculations .",
    "we will demonstrate in this paper that the non - analytic corrections to the fermi - liquid theory are universally related to the _ fermi - liquid _ non - analyticities in the dynamical bosonic response functions . to set the stage , we review briefly these non - analyticities .",
    "there are three physically distinct bosonic non - analyticities in a generic fermi liquid at @xmath26  @xcite .",

    "the non - analyticity in the particle - hole bubble at small momenta introduces the dependence of @xmath149 on the ratio @xmath150 , and eventually gives rise to the emergence of a zero - sound collective mode in a fermi liquid  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath103 non - analyticity gives rise to long - range friedel oscillations of electron density in a fermi liquid  @xcite and eventually accounts for @xmath157wave pairing in electron systems with short - range repulsive interaction   @xcite .",

    ", the instability occurs at only exponentially small frequencies , and we will neglect it , assuming that the system remains normal down to @xmath26 . still , as we will see , a non - analytic dependence on the ratio @xmath161 in @xmath162 will give rise to a non - analyticity in the self - energy and susceptibility .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we show that these non - analyticities give rise to universal subleading terms in the fermionic self - energy , effective mass , specific heat , and static spin susceptibility .",
    "in this section we obtain non - analytic corrections to the fermionic self - energy and consider how they affect observable quantities such as the effective mass and the specific heat .",
    "we will mostly focus on @xmath100 , but for the sake of completeness will also discuss the situation in @xmath35 and @xmath66 .",
    "we also assume for simplicity that the interaction is a contact one , i.e. , its fourier transform is independent of momentum .",
    "we will restore the momentum dependence of @xmath163 in sec .",
    "the ( matsubara ) fermionic self - energy is related to the green s function via @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 the two nontrivial second - order diagrams for @xmath167 are presented in fig . [ fig1 ] .",

    "if we assume that the prefactors depend on @xmath3 in a regular way , we obtain higher powers of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath203 . as we already mentioned , this form of @xmath204 yields , upon kramers - kronig transformation , a regular frequency expansion of the real part @xmath205 , where the prefactors are regular functions of @xmath30 .",
    "of particular importance here is the absence of @xmath206 term that would result in a linear - in-@xmath22 renormalization of the effective mass .",
    "it then follows that non - analytic corrections to @xmath207 can only emerge if the regular expansion of @xmath208 breaks down for typical momenta that contribute to @xmath203 .",
