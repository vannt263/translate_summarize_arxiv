    "the sources of uncertainty in the absolute cross - section measurements ( length , pressure and temperature ) are estimated to a total error of 6@xmath91 , which has to be added to the statistical error due to the noise at each recorded point  @xcite .",
    "the ly-@xmath47 and ion detection efficiencies depend on the geometry and the detectors used , but are independent of the wavelength .",

    "the fluorescence signal has been recorded undispersedly by a visible sensitive photomultiplier .",
    "therefore this signal can not be calibrated to absolute cross sections , since the spectral quantum efficiency of the multiplier varies with varying wavelengths , i.e. from one level to the other .",
    "quantitative information on the fluorescence cross sections is obtained by subtracting the dissociation and ionization spectra from the absorption spectrum  @xcite @xmath93 and is referred to as the difference spectrum .",
    "the @xmath94 levels radiate and therefore appear in the fluorescence spectrum , which is less congested and has a better signal to noise ratio than the absorption spectrum .",
    "their dissociation and ionization rates are below 5@xmath91 and they are hardly visible in the dissociation or ionization spectra .",
    "the difference spectrum thus reproduces the absorption spectrum for these transitions , within an uncertainty of 15 - 20@xmath91 and represents a relatively sparse spectrum from which several absolute cross sections are determined for the @xmath94 states  @xcite .",
