    "the exact eigenspectra and eigenstates of a spin-2 condensate are derived @xcite , which shows that the ground state is in general fragmented .",

    "( [ geigenequations ] ) . @xmath219 and @xmath220 are used for numerical calculations , together with the intra- and inter - species spin - dependent parameters @xmath152 , @xmath209 , and @xmath217 .",

    "[ fig7 ] , we present all bogoliubov excitation spectra , from which one can easily verify the three gapless goldstone modes .",
    "in conclusion , we construct the ground state phase diagram for a binary mixture of two spin-1 condensates under an external weak b - field .",
    "our results show that the phase diagram can be classified into two categories : the axisymmetry preserved and broken phases . the first one is shown to contain the ff , aa , @xmath114 , @xmath145 , @xmath153 , and nn phases , while the second one contains only single phase : the ba phase , which appears only when the inter - species anti - ferromagnetic spin - exchange interaction is sufficiently large when compared to the intra - species spin - exchange and linear zeeman shifts .",
    "furthermore , according to the number of the gapless goldstone modes , the ground state phases can be classified into four classes : two- , three- , four- , and six - component class , respectively accompanied by two , three , four , and three gapless goldstone modes .",
    "we calculate all the bogoliubov excitation spectra with both analytical or numerical techniques , and confirm our arguments given above .",
    "since the interspecies s - wave interaction parameters between two spin-1 atoms , such as between @xmath2rb and @xmath3na atoms , are not precisely known , we can not conclude which of the above discussed phases can be realized experimentally within presently available experimental technologies .",

    "in this appendix , we give the detail discussion on how to clarify all possible ground state phases for a binary mixture of spin-1 condensates under an external weak b - field .",
    "first , we assume that spontaneous axisymmetry breaking doest not occur in either species , which results in @xmath221 . for species one",
    ", we then have @xmath222 for the ground state . without loss of generality",
    ", an unitary transformation can be affected to set @xmath223 as a real number . as a result",
    ", there left only two solutions for eq .",
    "( [ f1peq0 ] ) : @xmath224 or @xmath225 . for the latter case",
    ", we infer that @xmath226 and @xmath69 , which is a state degenerate with @xmath227 , with arbitrary angles @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "therefore the ground states is limited to the subspace with @xmath224 .",
    "for the second species , an analogous reduction gives a similar subspace with @xmath230 .",
    "summarizing , without spontaneous axisymmetry breaking , the ground states of the energy functional for a binary mixture of two spin-1 condensates , eq .",
    "( [ sdenergy ] ) , can be chosen as @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "next , we consider the structure of all possible spontaneous axisymmetry breaking ground states . for a single spin-1 condensate , the linear zeeman shift does not induce ba phase .",
    "if a spontaneous ba phase arises in a mixture , both species must break axisymmetry .",
    "we therefore search for the ground states of the ba phase in the subspace of @xmath233 and @xmath234 , with @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "since @xmath30 , the ba phase appears for anti - ferromagnetic interspecies spin - exchange interaction with @xmath216 . in the ground states ,",
    "the transverse magnetization of the two species must align along opposite directions .",
    "the order parameter for the ba phase can be found from the following equations @xmath237 the solution of the above equations for the ba phase is given by @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "we can calculate the first derivatives of the spin - dependent energy function @xmath240 with respect to @xmath241 and @xmath242 at the ba phase , and the results are @xmath243 we therefore conclude that the ba phase is possiblely exist only when @xmath244 . because the first derivatives are both independent of @xmath241 and @xmath242 , the ground states of the ba phase will have @xmath245",
    ".    the actual ground state is found through a comparison of the ground state energies for two types of phases : with / without broken - axisymmetry .",
    "in addition , the results found here are subsequently affirmed with the numerical ones from the use of simulated annealing method @xcite to minimize the spin - dependent energy functional .",
