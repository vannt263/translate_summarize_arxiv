    "more than a century after thompson s considerations about the organization of repulsive charged particles in spherical shells  @xcite , the problem of ordering and minimum - energy configurations of particles on curved surfaces has attracted renewed interest  @xcite .",
    "a theory has recently been proposed which derives ground - state particle configurations on 2-dimensional ( 2d ) curved manifolds from the effective free - energy of relevant interacting topological defects , disclinations and dislocations  @xcite .",
    "it has been mainly applied to `` spherical crystals '' , _",
    "i.e. _ defected triangular tilings on the surface of a sphere , for which it predicts the appearance of stable `` grain boundary scars '' formed by strings of dislocations emanating from an irreducible curvature - induced disclination and terminating in the crystal .",
    "such defect structures are energically forbidden in flat ( euclidean ) space and result from the nonzero curvature of space .",
    "this prediction , as well as more specific ones concerning either the structure or the dynamics of the defects , have been confirmed in both simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite on spherical crystals .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to test the theoretical predictions on 2d manifolds of constant _ negative _ curvature .",
    "negative curvature brings in new features compared to the more familiar positive curvature of spherical geometry .",
    "first , a homogeneous space of constant negative curvature can be of infinite extent : in 2d , this is the hyperbolic plane @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "a thermodynamic limit and _ bona fide _ phase transitions may be envisaged , contrary to what occurs on a sphere .",
    "secondly , the hyperbolic plane as a whole can not be embedded in 3d euclidean space so that physical realizations of negatively curved manifolds in soft and hard condensed matter do not have constant curvature .",
    "they can be negatively curved locally , in the form of a saddle point , or in a more extended way , as on the inner wall of a torus  @xcite .",
    "they can also be of arbitrary spatial extent with a negative gaussian curvature only on average , such as the `` minimal surfaces '' found for example in bicontinuous phases of amphiphilic bilayers  @xcite .    here , we consider an equilibrium system of atoms interacting with a circularly symmetric pair potential on the hyperbolic plane , which we investigate through molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "this model has been introduced and already studied in the frustration - based approach of glasses  @xcite , of supercooled liquids and the glass transition  @xcite , and of jamming  @xcite . in the present context of low - energy configurations of particles and associated topological defects , we focus on the model at low temperature , in a regime where the spatial extension of the local hexagonal / hexatic order characteristic of the liquid has saturated due to the frustrating effect of space curvature  @xcite .",
    "we find that the atomic configurations consist of rare defect structures in an otherwise 6-fold coordinated background . at the temperatures at",
    "which equilibration is still possible on the simulation time scale , the system is disordered at long length scales and appears as a very slowly relaxing `` glassy '' liquid .",
    "interestingly , the defect structures are organized much like what has been found in spherical geometry and predicted by the continuum theory of defects  @xcite .",
    "they form grain boundary scars emanating from an irreducible number of disclinations forced in the medium by the topology of the embedding manifold . by changing the magnitude of the curvature , we also confirm , at least in a semi - quantitative way , several predictions of the theory .    the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the atomistic model and we shortly describe basic notions and specific features coming with the hyperbolic geometry as well as the way we handle them in the computer simulations . in section iii",
    ", we review the continuum theory of defects and apply it to negatively curved 2d manifolds .",
    "section iv is devoted to the simulation results and their comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , we give some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "we consider a one - component atomic liquid embedded in the hyperbolic plane @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is a homogeneous surface of constant negative curvature @xmath1 , the associated hyperbolic metric being obtained from @xmath2 with @xmath3 the appropriate polar coordinates  @xcite .",
    "the atoms interact through the lennard - jones potential @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the geodesic distance between atom centers .",
    "we have investigated this model by means of molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "the simulations have been performed at fixed density @xmath6 in the nve ensemble , and several curvature magnitudes , parametrized by @xmath7 , have been considered .",
    "we have restricted our study to `` small '' curvatures ( @xmath8 ) for which the local arrangement of the atoms is the same as in flat ( euclidean ) space , _ i.e. _ hexagonal .",
    "due to the curvature - induced frustration , hexagonal tiling of the whole plane is however forbidden and an irreducible density of defects must be present . for larger curvatures ( @xmath9 ) , local heptagonal , octagonal , etc ... , atomic arrangements become preferred in the liquid and , for specific ranges of values , this may lead to unfrustrated ( quasi ) long - range ordering in regular lattices with coordination numbers @xmath10 at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic geometry requires extending the usual methods and algorithms used in euclidean space in order to account for boundary effects ( which are never negligible compared to bulk contributions ) , parallel transport of vectors ( which is not globally defined on curved manifolds ) , and visualization ( since @xmath0 can not be embedded in @xmath11 euclidean space ) .",
    "details on the procedures are given elsewhere  @xcite . we just mention here that , to study bulk behavior , we have implemented periodic boundary conditions  @xcite . quite generally , periodic boundary conditions can be envisaged from both a `` geometrical '' and a `` topological '' perspective . from a geometrical point of view , a periodic boundary condition amounts to replicating a primitive cell containing the system of interest in order to generate a tiling of the whole space . from a topological one",
    ", a periodic boundary condition implies providing a rule to pair the edges of the primitive cell , which leads , after identification of the paired edges , to a `` quotient space '' that can be represented as a multi - connected compact manifold .",
    "the primitive cell together with the edge pairing rule define a `` fundamental polygon ''  @xcite . on the hyperbolic plane",
    ", there is an infinite number of possibilities .",
    "a given fundamental polygon is then characterized by an area , or equivalently by the genus of the associated compact manifold ( see below eq .  ) , a number of sides , which for regular polygons and for a given genus fixes the associated tiling , and a pairing of its sides . in the present study , we have used two different boundary conditions .",
    "the first one corresponds to an octagonal primitive cell whose quotient space can be topologically described as a compact manifold of genus @xmath12 ( a `` 2-hole torus '' ) ; the associated tiling of the hyperbolic plane @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath13 , meaning that @xmath14 octagons meet at each vertex ( more generally , the schlfli notation @xmath15 denotes a tiling in which @xmath16 regular polygons with @xmath17 edges meet at each vertex ) .",
    "the other periodic boundary condition is based on a a polygonal cell with @xmath18 edges and a quotient space with genus @xmath19 ( `` a 3-hole torus '' ) ; the associated tiling of @xmath0 is a @xmath20 one .",
    "choosing these two different conditions allows us to check that the observed behavior of the liquid does correspond to bulk behavior with negligible finite - size effect : the area of the @xmath18-gon is indeed twice bigger than the area of the octagon whereas , as will be shown below , the measured quantities are essentially identical in both cases .",
    "visualization , on the other hand , is obtained through the poincar disk model  @xcite .",
    "this is a projection of the whole hyperbolic plane @xmath0 onto a unit disk .",
    "the projection is conformal ( angles are preserved ) but not isometric ( distances are deformed and shrink as one reaches the disk boundary ) .",
    "others representations of @xmath0 exist , each having its own advantages : the poincar half - plane , the klein model , the hyperboloid of revolution endowed with the lorentz metric ( @xmath21 )  @xcite .",
    "an often used way to represent @xmath0 in real space is the so - called pseudosphere : it does not need any projection , has a constant negative curvature , and is of infinite extent .",
    "its shape is defined by the surface of revolution of a tractrix  @xcite around its asymptote and can be roughly seen as a trumpet horn of infinite height .",
    "we have however chosen the poincar disk model because it is well suited for the visualization of particles and defects .    in 2d space ,",
    "topological defects are point - like .",
    "a microscopic definition of the elementary defects , which are disclinations in a reference hexagonal crystal , is possible through a delaunay triangulation of the atomic configurations .",
    "the procedure can be generalized to the hyperbolic plane , for which it has been shown to be unique when the ensemble of points formed by the atomic centers is dense enough  @xcite , a condition always satisfied in our system . from the delaunay construction ,",
    "one can then determine the coordination number of each atom in the liquid .",
    "when @xmath8 and at low temperature @xmath22 , most atoms are @xmath23-fold coordinated , which corresponds to a local hexagonal arrangement , and defects are located on atoms whose coordination number differs from @xmath23 : for instance , a @xmath24-fold coordinated atom corresponds to a negative disclination of topological charge @xmath25 whereas a @xmath26-fold one corresponds to a positive disclination of charge @xmath27 ; disclinations of higher charges @xmath28 with an integer @xmath29 are very rare at low @xmath22 . for illustration ,",
    "two configurations at high @xmath22 ( above the ordering transition @xmath30 in flat space ) and low @xmath22 ( significantly below @xmath30 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atomicconfs ] . in this work ,",
    "we only focus on defect structures at low temperature , when the spatial extension of the local hexagonal order ( which grows as @xmath22 decreases ) has saturated as a result of curvature - induced frustration  @xcite .    in 2d space ,",
    "there are two important identities , the euler - poincar relation and the gauss - bonnet theorem  @xcite .",
    "the former only involves topology and for @xmath31 points on a compact surface that is triangulated via the delaunay construction , it reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average coordination number of the points and where we have used the definition of the euler characteristic of the surface in terms of the genus , @xmath34 . on the other hand , for a surface @xmath35 of total area @xmath36 embedded in the hyperbolic plane @xmath0 of curvature @xmath1 ,",
    "the gauss - bonnet theorem states that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the determinant of the metric tensor at point @xmath39 , which in polar coordinates is simply equal to @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the curvature being constant , eq .",
    "( [ eq_gauss_bonnet ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath41 which combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq_euler_poincare ] ) gives the deviation from @xmath23 of the average coordination number in terms of the density of particles @xmath42 and the curvature : @xmath43 one can apply eqs .   and to the elementary cell of the tiling of @xmath0 generated by the periodic boundary conditions ( this cell corresponds to the fundamental polygon defining the periodic boundary condition ,",
    "see section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "( [ eq_euler_poincare ] ) shows that , neglecting disclinations of charge magnitude higher than @xmath27  , as the energy of a free disclination is proportional to its charge magnitude . for the system studied here , in the range of temperatures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : defectsdensity ] and for all curvatures , the total density of disclinations with charge magnitude strictly larger than @xmath27 is always less than @xmath44 , whereas the density of @xmath26-fold and @xmath24-fold disclinations is roughly two orders of magnitude bigger .",
    "] , _ i.e. _ particles with coordination number @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the cell must contain an _ excess _ of exactly @xmath47 negative @xmath24-fold disclinations ( the remaining @xmath24-fold disclinations exactly compensate the number of @xmath26-fold disclinations ) .",
    "thus , an excess of @xmath48 such disclinations is present for the octagonal cell ( @xmath12 ) and of @xmath49 for the @xmath18-gonal cell ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the result on a sphere where an excess of @xmath48 positive @xmath26-fold disclinations is required .",
    "in addition , eq .  ( [ eq_gauss_bonnet2 ] ) shows that the area of the elementary cell depends on both the curvature and the type of boundary condition ( through the genus @xmath50 ) . note",
    "then that the excess density of @xmath24-fold disclinations is independent of the specific fundamental polygon chosen for the periodic boundary condition and only depends on the curvature .",
    "it is indeed equal to @xmath51=3\\kappa^2/\\pi$ ] .",
    "in this section , we summarize the continuum theory developed in refs .",
    "we more specifically apply it to negatively curved manifolds , which is appropriate for our atomic model on @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the formalism directly deals with defect degrees of freedom and starts with the elementary ones , the disclinations , from which all other topological defects can subsequently be built .",
    "six - coordinated particles are treated using continuum elastic theory  @xcite . at low temperature ,",
    "the elastic free energy of an arbitrary disclination density on a 2d manifold @xmath35 of constant negative curvature @xmath52 is given by  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the young modulus of the hexagonal crystal in flat space , @xmath55 is the inverse laplacian - squared operator , and @xmath56 the disclination density , defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( i.e. , all integers except zero ) is the reduced topological charge of the @xmath59th disclination located at @xmath60 ( in practice at low @xmath22 , we only need to consider @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 is the total number of disclinations in @xmath35 ; finally , @xmath63 is a disclination core ( free ) energy , renormalized by thermal fluctuations  @xcite . note that in the present problem , eq .  ( [ eq_continuum_f_disclin ] ) is the free energy for the elementary cell of the tiling of @xmath0 associated with the periodic boundary condition",
    ". provided interactions between cells are weak , the total free energy of the whole system is just this quantity multiplied by the ( macroscopic ) number of cells .",
    "this is of course different from spherical geometry where the whole system is finite .",
    "the disclination density must therefore satisfy a `` topological '' generalization of the electroneutrality constraint , namely , @xmath64 even at finite temperature . by using eq .",
    "( [ eq_disclin_density ] ) and the gauss - bonnet theorem , eq .",
    "( [ eq_gauss_bonnet2 ] ) , the above expression leads to a sum rule on the total topological charge , namely @xmath65 not surprisingly , one then obtains the same result as previously derived on the basis of the euler - poincar relation : there must be an excess of @xmath47 disclinations with elementary charge @xmath66 ( per elementary cell ) at low @xmath22 .",
    "the presence of the @xmath47 _ localized _ irreducible defects only imperfectly screens the curvature which is _ uniform _ throughout space .",
    "the resulting elastic strain energy could then potentially be reduced by introducing dislocations that represent tightly bound pairs of @xmath67 and @xmath68 disclinations .",
    "the amplitude of the stress generated by one of the irreducible , unpaired , @xmath68 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath24-fold ) disclinations is controlled by an effective disclination charge at a geodesic distance @xmath5 of the disclination center .",

    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for spherical geometries that there is a range of dimensionless curvatures @xmath7 for which the strain energy associated with the stress field generated by the irreducible disclinations is minimized by the presence of strings of dislocations that radiate from each of the irreducible disclinations .",
    "this can easily be transposed to hyperbolic geometry .",
    "these strings of dislocations , whose burgers vector is perpendicular to the string axis , terminate in the crystalline background at a distance of the order of the critical radius @xmath71 .",
    "these structures have been dubbed `` grain boundary scars ''  @xcite .",
    "the typical number of dislocations per irreducible disclination can be estimated at zero temperature by assuming that a scar contains @xmath72 strings aligned along geodesics emanating from the disclination center .",
    "it has then been argued  @xcite that dislocations along a geodesic are roughly separated by a distance @xmath73 , so that the number of dislocations per irreducible disclination is given by @xmath74 ( \\kappa \\sigma)^{-1}\\\\ & \\simeq - cst + 0.3998 \\ , ( \\kappa \\sigma)^{-1 } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 denotes a constant coming from subdominant terms which depend on microscopic details ( such as the young modulus and the core energies ) .",
    "in contrast , the contribution proportional to @xmath76 is universal for a given geometry and underlying type of crystalline order .",

    "the glide motion takes place along the burgers vector as indicated by the arrow.,width=302 ]    we now turn to the dynamics of the defects at low temperatures .",
    "we focus on the structural relaxation time @xmath85 at low but finite @xmath22 .",
    "we again consider a situation in which there are @xmath47 noninteracting grain boundary scars .",
    "a simple estimate of the structural relaxation time is provided by the time scale for the diffusion of the most loosely bound dislocation in a scar to another scar .",
    "climb motion being energetically prohibitive , the motion of a dislocation proceeds via thermally activated glide motion ( _ i.e. _ parallel to the burgers vector ) .",
    "this takes place in a potential energy that combines the peierls potential due to the underlying lattice and the interaction potential with both the central disclination and the other dislocations of the scar  @xcite .",
    "the main contribution to the activation energy barrier along the dislocation motion is due to the disclination - dislocation interaction .",
    "the latter increases as the distance between the outermost dislocation and the central disclination increases along the glide direction ( which , we recall , is perpendicular to the average direction of the string : see fig .",
    "[ fig : scarsketch ] ) . a crude estimate for the barrier",
    "is obtained from a harmonic approximation to @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_disclin_disloc ] ) for a _ transverse _ displacement of the dislocation . for small curvature magnitude @xmath7 and after taking into account that the outermost dislocation is originally at a distance @xmath87 of the central disclination , this leads to @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a constant of order unity and @xmath90 is the distance along the geodesic that is perpendicular to the string at the position of the chosen dislocation ( _ e.g. _ , along the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : scarsketch ] ) . to relax the underlying translational order ,",
    "the dislocation should move a distance of order @xmath82 ( which corresponds to the typical distance between grain boundary scars ) .",
    "this involves an energy barrier whose order of magnitude estimated from eq .",

    "the final estimate for the structural relaxation time is thus @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a `` bare '' glide diffusion constant ( _ i.e. _ describing small displacements of a free dislocation  @xcite ) , @xmath94 is the energy barrier due to the peierls potential and other subdominant terms , and @xmath95 corresponds to the barrier estimated above .",
    "these predictions will be compared with simulation results below .",
    "the above arguments have been directly adapted from the theory of spherical crystals , with the necessary changes coming from the negative curvature .",
    "however , there may be a more serious difference between spherical and hyperbolic geometries due to the fact that the atomic system is of finite extent in the former and possibly of infinite extent in the latter ( with periodic boundary conditions , a proper thermodynamic limit can be taken ) .",
    "as mentioned above , _ bona fide _ thermodynamic phase transitions are possible in the hyperbolic plane @xmath0 , but not on the sphere .",
    "strictly speaking , freezing of the @xmath48 irreducible @xmath26-fold disclinations on a sphere in an icosahedral superlattice only occurs at zero temperature . at finite temperature , provided of course",
    "that one waits long enough for equilibrium to be achieved , the @xmath48 defects can move distances of the order of the sphere radius and the whole system continuously reorganizes . on @xmath0 on the other hand",
    ", one can envisage a crystal of defects formed by a periodic arrangement of the irreducible @xmath24-fold disclinations ( with or without associated grain boundary scars ) on a @xmath96 lattice .",
    "the latter lattice is the only one that is compatible with a predominance of 6-fold coordination numbers .",
    "indeed , in the hyperbolic plane , each possible lattice possesses a uniquely determined lattice spacing ( for a given curvature ) , which is characteristic of its symmetry .",
    "thus , there exists only one possible lattice compatible with the density of irreducible defects . long range or quasi - long range order",
    "could then be achieved through a finite - temperature phase transition , much like the formation of an abrikosov - like lattice of vortices in a uniformly frustrated @xmath97 spin model in 2d flat space  @xcite . checking",
    "this possibility in simulations of our atomic liquid model is however very hard for two reasons : the difficult equilibration of the system at low temperature in the `` glassy '' liquid regime on one hand and the constraint due to the periodic boundary condition on the other .",
    "the latter constraint comes from the fact that the elementary cell of the periodic boundary condition procedure , with its @xmath47 irreducible disclinations , should be compatible with the @xmath96 tiling of the hyperbolic plane with vertices centered on the irreducible defects   tiling and deduce from it the associated density of vertices .",
