    "this analysis , however , used a `` square '' algorithm , utilizing photon data over the range @xmath11  kev to derive the electron spectrum in the same energy range ; because of the flatness of the spectrum in this event , they were forced to utilize an extrapolation of the electron spectrum above 160  kev by a power - law tail to adequately account for the ( significant ) contribution of electrons at energies @xmath12  kev to the photon emission in the @xmath13 $ ]  kev range .    as pointed out in the companion paper ( kontar et al .",

    "rhessi ( lin et al . , 2002 ) has nine detectors , each designed to have a 1kev resolution in photon energy . in practice",
    "however , detectors 2 and 7 have a poorer resolution than intended ( smith et al . , 2002 ) and",
    "so all results presented here are based only on the seven fully functional front segments .",
    "we used 1 kev energy bins and time bins equal to rhessi s rotation period ( as given for the time of the flare ) .",
    "this ensured that background and analysis intervals were multiples of the rotation period eliminating any modulation from the imaging grids .",
    "the top left panel of figure  [ results_zero ] shows the photon spectrum for the second time interval ( 10:26:20 - 10:26:40  ut ) , up to a maximum photon energy @xmath23  kev for this time intervals . in the spectrum at energies higher than 160  kev , the uncertainties are comparable to the signal itself and thus has been ignored ( maximum energy in photon spectrum changes from spectrum to spectrum ) .",
    "the photon data used extended over the range @xmath24  kev , while the electron energy band used in the non - square inversion algorithm extended from @xmath25  kev ( above 480  kev the solution becomes uncertain ) .",
    "the results are shown as a confidence interval , i.e. a series of realizations of @xmath0 , each corresponding to a different noise realization of the photon spectrum , with the noise level determined by the uncertainty in each photon energy bin .    the photon spectrum reconstructed from the mean of this confidence strip",
    "is shown overlaid on the data in the top left panel of figure  [ results_zero ] , while the top right panel of that figure shows the residuals ( data  reconstructed spectrum ) , normalized to the standard deviation at each energy .",
    "the lower right panel of figure  [ results_zero ] shows that the cumulative residuals ( paper i ) mostly fall within the bound , indicating that the recovered mean source electron spectrum @xmath0 reproduces the observed photon spectrum well , with no systematic differences between the forward - fitted spectrum and the original data .",
    "figure  [ results_one ] shows the same quantities as figure  [ results_zero ] , for the same photon spectrum , but now using a _ first_-order regularization algorithm",
    "( see appendix  a of paper  i ) . since first - order regularization techniques seek to minimize the norm of the _ derivatives _ ( rather than the amplitude ) of @xmath0 , the form of @xmath0 is `` smoother '' than that of @xmath0 , particularly where the slope of @xmath0 changes somewhat abruptly ( e.g. , at the transition from `` thermal '' to `` non - thermal '' form at around 30  kev ) .",
    "the residuals are similarly well - behaved to those for the zero order regularization ( figure  [ results_zero ] ) .",
    "figure  [ results_two ] shows the same quantities , but the spectrum is smoother in some ranges and is not for other regions .",
    "the lack of smoothness in the solution indicates difficulties to approximate an electron spectrum with differentiable functions in that region of energies .    note , that the error bars ( paper i ) in all the figures are at @xmath20 level ( 65% confidence ) .",
    "therefore , the errors do not allow us conclude that the feature near 20 kev seen in figure  [ results_zero ] and figure  [ results_two ] is real .",
    "the mean electron spectrum using zero order regularization @xmath0 for the time interval ( 10:26:20 - 10:26:40  ut ) is shown in the figure ( [ results_zero ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the high - energy cutoffs revealed by this analysis are all at an energy well above the maximum photon energy sampled .",
    "inversions of the same data set using a binned matrix method ( johns & lin 1992 ) yield similar results ( with much coarser energy resolution ) for the mean source electron spectrum below 200  kev ( johns - krull , personal communication ) but , by the intrinsic nature of the matrix inversion method , it can not provide unbiased information on the electron spectrum above @xmath26 .",
    "we note that both zero order and first order @xmath0 curves become much smoother above @xmath16 , because of the lack of ( noisy ) data at such high energies .",
    "this result illustrates convincingly the power of the regularization technique to use subtle features in the photon spectrum to provide valuable information on the source electron spectrum over a wide range of energies ( paper i ) .",
    "the spectra @xmath0 defined by equation  ( [ def ] ) are _ mean source electron spectra _ , and so represent ( density - weighted ) averages of the electron flux spectra over the entire source ( brown , emslie , & kontar 2003 ) .",
    "emslie ( 2003 ) has provided a formula ( his equation [ 5 ] ) linking the _ injected _ electron spectrum @xmath2 to @xmath0 , for a given energy loss model for the electrons .",
    "if we approximate the target by a fully ionized `` cold '' target , then we recover emslie s equation ( 6 ) , viz .",
    "( see brown & emslie 1988 )    @xmath27    the appearance of the derivative @xmath28 in this expression means that in calculating injected electron spectra @xmath2 , it is important to accurately estimate not only @xmath0 , but also its logarithmic slope .",
    "hence regularized solutions that seek to minimize variations in this slope from point to point will produce smoother forms of @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ delta ] shows the variation of the local spectral index @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "because the second - order regularization method is specifically designed to minimize fluctuations in the second derivative , the variation of the first derivative ( and so @xmath31 ) is much smoother than for the other two orders of regularization .",
    "we therefore expect that a second - order regularization method will produce the smoothest forms of the injected electron spectrum @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ dyn_inj ] shows the forms of the injected spectrum @xmath2 in arbitrary units for all five time interval using first order regularization methods .",
    "as expected , the second order solution @xmath2 shows the most `` reasonable '' behavior .",
    "not surprisingly , the injected electron spectra show high - energy cutoffs at values similar to that of the corresponding mean source electron spectra .",
    "the most important result of this study is that hard x - ray spectra over a finite range of photon energies still carry vital information on the responsible electron spectrum at electron energies substantially higher than the maximum photon energy observed , and that this information can be extracted quantitatively using a non - square tikhonov regularization technique ( paper i ) .",
    "further , use of higher - order regularization techniques can produce mean source electron spectra with forms suitable for further analysis , such as the calculation of the electron spectrum , injected into a collisional thick target , that produces the inferred mean source electron spectrum .",
    "application of this technique to a flare on february 26 , 2002 has shown that the maximum accelerated electron energy rises and falls with time after the peak of the event , concurrent with a growing low - energy thermal component of the hard x - ray emission .",
    "this reduction in the maximum accelerated electron energy may be associated with the changing atmospheric conditions evidenced by the enhanced thermal emission at these later times ; the increase in soft x - ray emission may be connected with a larger coronal density which may act to suppress electron acceleration to high energies .",
    "electrons subjected to an applied electric field @xmath32 obey the equation of motion      where @xmath34 is the magnitude of the electronic charge , @xmath35 is the electron thermal velocity and @xmath36 ( v  cm@xmath4 ) is the dreicer field ( dreicer , 1959 ) .",
    "they therefore suffer runaway accleration above a critical velocity      the electrons that suffer runaway acceleration emerge from an acceleration region of length @xmath39 with an energy given by the solution of equation  ( [ motion ] ) . as the density @xmath40 increases ,",
    "commensurate with the increased emission measure evidenced by the enhanced thermal emission at later time intervals ( figure  [ dyn_mean ] ) , the value of the dreicer field is correspondingly increased , the ratio @xmath41 increases and , by equation  ( [ motion ] ) , the net force on each electron , and hence its emergent energy ( `` injection energy '' ) is decreased ."
