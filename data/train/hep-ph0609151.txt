    "the use of techniques and concepts from effective field theories ( eft s ) has lead to an encouraging record of achievements for the description of nonrelativistic fermion - antifermion systems .",
    "the formulation of a nonrelativistic eft for such systems has gone through a number of important conceptual states  @xcite .",
    "bodwin , braaten and lepage  @xcite initially formulated a method for separating fluctuations at short distances of order the heavy particle mass @xmath2 from those at long distances related to the nonrelativistic momentum and energy , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the relative velocity ) and the hadronic scale @xmath6 .",
    "subsequent work helped to clarify the power counting in @xmath5 , and the relevant degrees of freedom needed to construct an eft .",
    "for very heavy quarkonium systems , characterized by the scale hierarchy @xmath7 the formulation has reached a mature state . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was realized that it is necessary to distinguish soft ( @xmath8 ) and ultrasoft ( @xmath9 ) fluctuations and in ref .",
    "@xcite that the original nrqcd action  @xcite is problematic concerning the simultaneous power counting of soft and ultrasoft terms . in particular , the lagrangian needs to be multipole - expanded in the presence of ultrasoft gluons  @xcite .",
    "technically this can be formulated by introducing soft as well as ultrasoft gluons in the theory  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , based on the hierarchy @xmath10 , it was suggested to employ a series of eft s , one for the scales @xmath11 and one for @xmath12 , called pnrqcd ( `` potential '' nrqcd ) .",
    "the pnrqcd is derived in a two - step matching procedure where the intermediate soft matching scale and the pnrqcd renormalization scale are independent at the field theoretic level .",
    "this is appropriate e.g. for static quarks where the momentum is fixed by the quark separation @xmath13 and not correlated with the dynamical energy fluctuations @xmath14 .",
    "the potential interactions are generated from integrating out soft fluctuations at the soft matching scale .    in ref .",
    "@xcite is was pointed out that for dynamical heavy quarkonium systems the dispersive correlation between ultrasoft energy and soft momentum scales , @xmath15 , can be implemented systematically at the field theoretic level by matching to the proper eft directly at the hard scale @xmath16 ( one - step matching ) .",
    "the eft , called vnrqcd ( `` velocity '' nrqcd ) has a strict power counting in @xmath5 .",
    "it contains soft and ultrasoft degrees of freedom as well as soft and ultrasoft renormalization scales , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . through the different velocity counting of soft and ultrasoft fields",
    "they are correlated as @xmath19 , where usually the constant of proportionality is set to @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 . the renormalization group running of the theory is then conveniently expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 .",
    "the matching is carried out at the hard scale @xmath23 and the theory is evolved to @xmath24 of order of the relative velocity of the two - body system for computations of matrix elements .",
    "the running properly sums logarithms of the momentum and the energy scale at the same time  @xcite and is referred to as the velocity renormalization group ( vrg )  @xcite . within dimensional regularization the powers of @xmath25 and @xmath26 multiplying the operators of the lagrangian",
    "are uniquely determined by the @xmath5 counting and the dimension of the operators in @xmath27 dimensions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a three - loop renormalization of quark - antiquark vertex diagrams was carried out for fermion - antifermion s - wave states , is was demonstrated that the one - step matching principle , upon which vnrqcd is based , is consistent under renormalization at the subleading order level , when subdivergences need to be subtracted and when uv divergences from heavy quark - antiquark loops and from soft or ultrasoft gluons appear simultaneously in single diagrams . up to now",
    "there is no analogous demonstration for the two - step matching principle .    with the vrg",
    ", the running of potentials relevant for the next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) description of the nonrelativistic dynamics of pairs of heavy quarks and colored scalars has been determined in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the nll running of leading ( in the @xmath5 expansion ) s - wave currents for heavy quark - antiquark production and of the leading s- and p - wave currents for pairs of colored scalars were determined in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "corresponding work in the pnrqcd formalism for heavy quarks was carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these computations , diagrams which simultaneously contain both uv divergences from heavy quark - antiquark loops and from soft or ultrasoft gluon loops do not arise .",
    "the final results based on the vrg and on pnrqcd agree , after the scale correlations from the one - step matching procedure of vnrqcd are imposed in pnrqcd . concerning the nnll running of the production currents ,",
    "only the contributions from three - loop vertex diagrams for the leading currents describing quark - antiquark pair production in an s - wave configuration  @xcite are known at this time in vnrqcd . for the nnll contributions that arise from the subleading order evolution of the coefficients that appears in the nll anomalous dimension of the current at present only the results for the coulomb potential  @xcite , the spin - dependent @xmath28 potentials  @xcite and from ultrasoft quark loops  @xcite",
    "have been determined .",
    "the main phenomenological application of the nonrelativistic eft for the situation @xmath29 is top quark pair production close to threshold at a future linear collider  @xcite . here",
    "the summation of logarithms of @xmath5 is crucial to control the large normalization uncertainties  @xcite that arise in fixed - order nonrelativistic computations that only account for the summation of coulomb potential insertions  @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the summation of logarithms of the velocity is also important for the description of squark pair production at threshold  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was also found that it is crucial to apply the eft for predictions of the @xmath30 cross section at @xmath31  gev  @xcite since here the @xmath32 final state interactions are dominated by nonrelativistic dynamics .    in this work",
    "we address the form and construction of non - relativistic interpolating currents for production and annihilation of a color singlet heavy particle - antiparticle pair with general quantum numbers @xmath1 in @xmath33 dimensions for quarks and colored scalars within nrqcd . in general , the interpolating currents for a specific @xmath1 state",
    "are associated to irreducible tensor representations of the so(n ) rotation group that can be built from the particle - antiparticle relative momentum and the bilinear covariants of the particle - antiparticle field operators . while in three dimensions the basis of interpolating currents for the different @xmath1 states is , by construction , unique , in general @xmath34 dimensions for fermions there exist evanescent operator structures that make the choice of basis for the interpolating currents ambiguous .",
    "this is because the structure of irreducible so(n ) representations for @xmath34 is inherently different and in general richer than in three dimensions .",
    "technically the ambiguity is related to the number of sigma matrices that generate the so(n ) rotations for the spinor wave functions . for explicit computations",
    "a specific choice of basis has to be made , which is associated to a specific choice of a renormalization scheme .",
    "a very similar problem has been treated systematically already some time ago in the framework of relativistic qcd and the effective weak hamiltonian  @xcite , and much of the statements that apply for the relativistic case can be directly transferred to the nonrelativistic theory . however , due to the nonrelativistic power counting some even more specific statements , can be made .",
    "in particular , the nll order matching conditions and anomalous dimensions of the @xmath1 interpolating currents that are leading in the nonrelativistic expansion are scheme independent .    using the explicit form of the interpolating currents obtained in this work we also determine the nll anomalous dimensions of the leading ( in the @xmath5 expansion ) currents describing color singlet heavy quark - antiquark and squark - antisquark pair production for arbitrary spin and angular momentum @xmath1 configurations .",
    "the results for low angular momentum states ( s , p , d ) are e.g. relevant for angular distributions at the threshold or for production and decay rates of squark - antisquark resonances in certain supersymmetric scenarios where squarks can have a very long lifetime .",
    "the results also shed some light on the importance of summing logarithms of @xmath5 for the production and annihilation rates of high angular momentum states . in this respect",
    "our results help to complete analogous higher order considerations in previous literature for the energy levels  @xcite and the wave - functions  @xcite .    for the presentations in this work",
    "we employ the notations from vnrqcd based on a label formalism for soft fields and the heavy quarks ( or scalars )  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that most of the results obtained in this work are applicable to nrqcd in general .",
    "in particular , the nll order anomalous dimensions obtained here are also valid in pnrqcd once the vnrqcd scale correlations from the one - step matching are imposed .",
