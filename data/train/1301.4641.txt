    "based on the measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels the atlas and cms collaborations have independently provided compelling evidence for a bosonic resonance around 125 - 126 gev @xcite .",
    "this is a great triumph for particle physics , but it also leads to a host of new questions about the nature of the boson .",
    "so far there exist large uncertainties in determining the rates of the two channels , and meanwhile , observation of the boson through other signals such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 channels is still far away from becoming significant@xcite .",
    "so although the preliminary data of the lhc indicate that the boson closely resembles the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) , the deficiencies of the sm itself such as gauge hierarchy problem suggest new physics explanation of the boson . obviously , in order to decide the right underlying theory , the lhc should exhaust its potential to measure the decay channels of the boson as accurately as possible in its high luminosity phase .    among the decay modes of the higgs - like boson @xmath12 ,",
    "the diphoton channel plays a very important role in determining its mass , spin and parity@xcite . at the same time , since the diphoton channel is mediated by loops of charged particles , it also acts as a sensitive probe to new physics .",
    "in fact , this feature has been widely utilized to explain the results of the atlas and cms collaborations on the inclusive diphoton signal in 2012@xcite , which were @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively for the signal rate normalized by its sm prediction @xcite . in this note , we concentrate on another decay mode @xmath15 . in the sm ,",
    "the branching ratio of this decay is about two thirds of that for the diphoton decay , and just like the diphoton signal , it can provide a clean final - state topology in determining the properties of the boson , such as its mass , spin and parity@xcite .",
    "moreover , since new charged particles affecting the diphoton decay can also contribute to the @xmath5 decay , the two decay modes should be correlated , and therefore studying them in a joint way can reveal more details about the underlying physics .",
    "albeit the advantages , in contrast to the diphoton decay which has been intensively studied , the @xmath5 decay was paid little attention in the past . for example , since the discovery of the boson only several works have been devoted to this decay in new physics models such as the type - ii seesaw model@xcite , the georgi - machacek model@xcite , the extensions of the sm by charged scalars in different @xmath16 representations@xcite and the sm with extra colored scalars@xcite , and until very recently have the cms and atlas collaborations set an upper limit on the ratio @xmath17 @xcite . note that although the @xmath5 signal suffers from a large irreducible background at the lhc @xcite , the higgs event from the process @xmath18 can be easily reconstructed at the next generation linear collider with the center of mass energy around 250 gev @xcite , which is very helpful in suppressing the background for such a signal .",
    "so there is a good prospect to precisely measure this decay in the future .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath19 decay channel of the sm - like higgs boson @xmath12 in low energy supersymmetric models such as the constrained mimimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm)@xcite , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm)@xcite and the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm)@xcite .",
    "we investigate the @xmath2 signal of the higgs production at the lhc and future @xmath4 linear colliders , and especially , we study its correlations with the @xmath3 signal",
    ". as we will show below , the @xmath5 signal rate may be either enhanced or suppressed in susy , and its correlation behavior is so model - dependent that it may be utilized to distinguish the models in high luminosity phase of the lhc .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the basic features of the susy models and present some formulae relevant to our calculation . in section iii",
    "we first discuss the effects of new charged susy particles on the partial decay widths of @xmath20 , then we study in a comparative way the @xmath2 and @xmath3 signal rates of the higgs production at different colliders .",
    "finally , we draw the conclusions in section iv .",
    "various couplings used in the calculation are given in the appendix .",
    "in a low energy supersymmetric gauge theory , the explicit form of its lagrangian is determined by the gauge symmetry , superpotential and also soft breaking terms . as for the four models considered in this work",
    ", their differences mainly come from the superpotential , which is the source for the yukawa interactions of fermions and self interactions of scalars .",
    "@xmath21 the mssm@xcite contain two higgs doublets @xmath22 and it predict five physical higgs bosons , of which two are cp - even , one is cp - odd and two are charged .",
    "its superpotential takes following form @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the yukawa interaction , and its form is given by @xmath25 after considering appropriate soft breaking terms , one can write down the higgs potential as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are all soft parameters with mass dimension , terms proportional to @xmath30 come from the @xmath31-term of the superpotential , and the last term comes from gauge symmetry ( so called @xmath32-term ) .",
    "this potential indicates that , after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath33-parameter is related to the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and so it should be @xmath34 .",
    "but on the other hand , since @xmath33 as the only parameter with mass dimension appears in the superpotential , its value should naturally take susy - preserving scale .",
    "such a tremendously large scale gap is usually referred as the @xmath33-problem @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework of the cmssm@xcite is exactly same as that of the mssm , and the only difference between them comes from the fact that in the general mssm , all soft breaking parameters are independent@xcite , while in the cmssm they are correlated . explicitly speaking",
    ", the cmssm assumes following universal soft breaking parameters at susy breaking scale ( usually chosen at the grand unification scale)@xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 denoting gaugino mass , scalar mass and trilinear interaction coefficient respectively , and evolves the four parameters down to weak scale to get all the soft breaking parameters of the mssm . in this sense",
    ", the parameter space of the cmssm should be considered as a subset of that for the mssm , and so is its phenomenology .",
    "@xmath39 in order to solve the @xmath33-problem in the mssm , various singlet extensions of the mssm were proposed in history , and among them the most well known models include the nmssm and the nmssm .",
    "the superpotentials of these two models are respectively given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are dimensionless parameters of order 1 , and the dimensionful parameter @xmath44 may be naturally fixed at weak scale in certain basic frameworks where the parameter is generated at a high loop level@xcite",
    ". one attractive feature of both the models comes from the fact that , after the real scalar component of @xmath45 develops a vev @xmath46 , an effective @xmath33 parameter is generated by @xmath47 , and its value may be as low as about @xmath48 without conflicting with current experiments @xcite ( in contrast , the @xmath33 parameter in the mssm must be larger than about @xmath49@xcite ) .",
    "another attractive feature of the models is that the z boson mass may be obtained with less fine tuning than the mssm@xcite . in the susy models , after the minimization of the higgs potential , the @xmath50 boson mass is given by@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the soft susy breaking masses of the higgs fields , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 arise from the radiative corrections to the higgs potential with dominant contribution to @xmath54 given by @xmath56 these two equations indicate that , if the individual terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ minimization ] ) are comparable in magnitude so that the observed value of @xmath57 is obtained without resorting to large cancelations , relatively light stops and @xmath33 of @xmath34 are preferred .",
    "as far as the nmssm and the nmssm are concerned , due to the higgs self interactions , the squared mass of the sm - like higgs boson gets an additional contribution @xmath58 ( compared with its mssm expression ) , and further it can be enhanced by the doublet - singlet mixing @xcite .",
    "consequently , predicting a @xmath59 higgs boson does not necessarily require heavy scalar top quarks@xcite .",
    "this is very helpful in reducing the tuning .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the fine tuning parameter @xmath60 , which is defined by @xmath61 with @xmath62 denoting susy parameter at gut scale @xcite ) , may be as low as 4 in the two models , while in the mssm it usually exceeds 100 @xcite .",
    "about the nmssm , one should note that the tadpole term in eq.([nmssm ] ) only affects the higgs masses and the minima of the scalar potential , so the interactions in the higgs and neutralino sectors of the nmssm are identical to those in the nmssm with @xmath63 .",
    "this enables us to modify the package @xmath64 @xcite and use it to study the phenomenology of the nmssm @xcite .",
    "also note that the singlino mass vanishes at tree level and the lightest neutralino as the dark matter candidate acquires its mass through the mixing of the singlino with higgsinos and gauginos . in this case , the dark matter is light and singlino dominated , and it must annihilate through exchanging a resonant light cp - odd higgs boson to get the correct relic density@xcite . as a result , the sm - like higgs boson will decay dominantly into light neutralinos or other light higgs bosons so that the branching fractions of the visible decay channels like @xmath65 are suppressed@xcite .",
    "this is strongly disfavored by current lhc data as shown in@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we only take the nmssm as an example to show its peculiar behaviors in higgs physics ( in comparison with other new susy models ) .",
    "* formula in calculation : * in order to study the @xmath66 decay and its correlation with the @xmath67 decay in susy , we define following normalized rates at the lhc and the international linear collider ( ilc)@xcite as @xmath68 where the higgs production at the lhc is dominated by the gluon fusion process , while at the ilc with @xmath69 , it is dominated by the @xmath70 associated production . here",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are the couplings of the higgs boson to gluons and @xmath50s respectively , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the partial widths for the decays @xmath0 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively . in getting these formulae",
    ", we neglect susy radiative corrections to the signals .",
    "those corrections are expected to be few percent given that heavy sparticles are preferred by current lhc experiments .    in susy ,",
    "the decays @xmath78 and @xmath79 get new contributions from the loops mediated by charged higgs bosons , sfermions ( including stops , sbottoms and staus ) as well as charginos .",
    "consequently , the formula of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are modified by @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) denote the contribution from particle @xmath85 mediated loops , and their explicit expressions are listed in the appendix .",
    "note that our expressions differ from those presented in @xcite in two aspects .",
    "one is that we have an overall minus sign for the new contributions @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and an additional factor 2 for the sfermion contributions .",
    "this sign difference was also observed recently in @xcite .",
    "the other difference is that we have included in a neat way the contributions from the loops with two particles ( such as @xmath89 and @xmath90 or @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) running in them .",
    "such contributions were considered to be negligibly small @xcite , but our results indicate that sometimes they may play a role . also note that in the susy package @xmath93 @xcite , the decay @xmath15 is not calculated . in the package @xmath64 @xcite , this decay is calculated only by considering the contributions from the sm particles and the charged higgs boson .",
    "we improve these packages by inserting our codes for @xmath15 .",
    "in our calculation , we first perform a random scan over the parameter space of each model by considering various experimental constraints",
    ". then for the surviving samples we investigate the @xmath94 and @xmath1 decays . since for each unconstrained susy model , there are too many free parameters involved in the calculation we make some assumptions to simplify our analysis .",
    "our treatment of the mssm and the nmssm is as follows    * firstly , we note that the first two generation squarks change little the properties of the higgs boson , and the lhc search for susy particles implies that they should be very heavy .",
    "so in our scan , we fix all soft masses and the trilinear parameters in this sector to be 2 tev .",
    "we checked that our conclusions are not affected by such specific choice .",
    "* secondly , since the third generation squarks affect the higgs sector significantly , we set free all soft parameters in this sector except that we assume @xmath95 and @xmath96 to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "* thirdly , considering that the muon anomalous magnetic moment is sensitive to the spectrum of scalar muons and the decay @xmath94 may get significant contribution from scalar tau ( stau ) sector , we assume @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and treat @xmath100 and @xmath101 as free parameters .",
    "we checked that for our considered cases , the decay @xmath15 is insensitive to @xmath102 . * finally , since our results are insensitive to gluino mass , we fix it at 2 tev .",
    "we also assume the grand unification relation @xmath103 for electroweak gaugino masses .",
    "to sum up , for the mssm we scan the parameters in the following regions @xmath104 note that in actual calculation @xmath41 and @xmath105 in the nmssm are usually treated as independent input parameters , and for any given value of @xmath105 the phenomenology of the nmssm is identical to that of the mssm with @xmath106 in the limit @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "this enables us to use the package nmssmtools @xcite , which calculates various observables and also considers various experimental constraints in the framework of the nmssm , to study the phenomenology of the mssm ( note that the validity of this method has been justified by the authors of the nmssmtools @xcite ) . in our calculation",
    "we use the package nmssmtools-3.2.4 to perform the scan for the mssm by setting @xmath108 and @xmath109 . here",
    "the value of @xmath110 is actually irrelevant to our calculation for the mssm as long as it is negative and satisfies @xmath111 ( in order to guarantee the squared masses of the singlet scalars to be positive ) @xcite .    for the nmssm",
    ", we use the package nmssmtools-3.2.4 to scan the region in eq.([mssmscan ] ) and also following ranges for additional parameters @xmath112 note that in our scan , we only consider a relatively large @xmath41 .",
    "the reason is in the nmssm , the properties of the sm - like higgs boson are expected to deviate significantly from the mssm prediction only for a sizable @xmath41 @xcite , and in particular , as far as @xmath113 is concerned , the higgs mass at tree level is maximized at @xmath114 , instead of at large @xmath115 in the mssm .    as for the nmssm , our assumptions are same as those for the mssm except that , in order to explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment at @xmath116 level ,",
    "we assume all soft susy breaking parameters in slepton sector to be 100 gev @xcite . such a slepton mass is allowed by the lep ii bounds , which are 99.9 gev for the first two generations and 93.2 gev for the third generation @xcite .",
    "although the lhc also gave a bound on slepton mass by searching for the decay @xmath117 @xcite , it is not applicable to the nmssm .",
    "the reason is that in the nmssm , the lsp is singlino - like and the nlsp is usually a bino - like neutralino @xmath118 . as a result ,",
    "the dominant decay chain of a slepton is @xmath119@xcite .",
    "other parameters in this model are scanned in the following ranges @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the soft breaking mass for the singlet higgs field . in our calculation",
    ", we adapt the code of the nmssmtools to the nmssm case as done in@xcite .    for the cmssm",

    "since in the cmssm different soft breaking parameters at electroweak scale are correlated , it is expected that its phenomenology cmssm is only a subset of the mssm .    in our scan",
    "we have considered various constraints on the models , which are from vacuum stability , the lep and lhc searches for susy particles and higgs bosons , the electroweak observables @xmath125 and @xmath126 , b physics observables such as the branching ratio of @xmath127 and the mass difference @xmath128 , the dark matter relic density and its direct detection experiments . when imposing the constraint from a certain observable which has experimental central value , we require susy to explain the observable at @xmath116 level . these constraints are described in detail in @xcite and have been implemented in the package nmssmtools-3.2.4 @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the dark matter relic density is calculated by the package @xcite , which now acts as an important component of the nmssmtools .",

    "we also show the cms bound on the rate in the figure @xcite . from the left panel",
    "we see that compared with its sm prediction , the @xmath5 rate in the mssm and the nmssm can be either enhanced or suppressed with the maximal deviation reaching @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "in contrast , as shown in the right panel , the @xmath5 rate is always slightly suppressed ( less than @xmath144 ) in the cmssm and severely suppressed ( more than @xmath130 ) in the nmssm .",
    "we checked that for the cmssm and the mssm , the suppression is mainly due to the increase of @xmath145 partial width @xcite .",
    "for the nmssm , however , it is due to the open up of new decays @xmath146 ( @xmath147 and @xmath148 denote the dark matter and lightest cp - odd higgs boson respectively ) , which significantly enlarges the total width of the higgs boson and leads to severe suppression for all visible decay channels .",
    "for the samples shown in fig.[fig1 ] , we also compare their predictions on the @xmath6 and @xmath149 signal rates of the higgs boson with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "we find that for most of the samples in the mssm and the nmssm and for all the samples in the cmssm , their theoretical predictions on the @xmath6 and @xmath149 rates agree with the corresponding data at @xmath150 level , while for the samples in the nmssm , their predictions always lie outside the @xmath151 regions ( see fig.1 and fig.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we checked that the branching ratio of @xmath145 in the mssm , nmssm and cmssm varies in the ranges [ @xmath152 , @xmath153 , [ @xmath154 , @xmath155 and [ @xmath143 , @xmath156 , respectively ( in the sm its value is about @xmath152 for @xmath157 ) , and the signal strength for the process @xmath158 normalized by its sm value varies from 0.97 to 1.12 , 0.55 to 1.05 and 1.00 to 1.02 , respectively .",
    "considering that so far the only way to detect the @xmath145 decay at the lhc is through the @xmath159 associated production , whose signal strength @xmath160 is @xmath161 from atlas result @xcite and @xmath162 from cms result @xcite , one can conclude that such alterations of @xmath10 signal rates are allowed by the current experimental data at @xmath116 level .     in the mssm and nmssm .",
    "the magenta bullets and blue triangles represent the samples with @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively.,width=604 ]    next we focus on the mssm and the nmssm . in fig.2",
    "we exhibit the contributions of different sparticles to the amplitude of the @xmath66 decay .",
    "since the sbottoms and charged higgs bosons have little effect on the amplitude , we do not show their contributions .",
    "this figure shows following features :    * in the mssm , the potentially largest contribution comes from the stau loops , which can alter the sm amplitude by about @xmath165 .",
    "in contrast , the stop contribution is small , which usually changes the amplitude by less than @xmath166 .",
    "this feature can be well understood by the formulae listed in appendix .",
    "explicitly speaking , in order to get a significant sfermion contribution , one necessary condition is @xmath167 should be as large as possible , where @xmath168 denotes the chiral flipping coupling of higgs to sfermions , @xmath169 is the chiral mixing angle and @xmath170 represents the lighter sfermion mass . as far as the stop sector is concerned , a relatively light @xmath171 is always accompanied by a heavy @xmath172 in order to predict @xmath173 . although @xmath174 in this case may be very large , the chiral mixing angle @xmath175 is usually small and consequently , the stop contribution can never get significantly enhanced . in the stau sector , however , both the parameters @xmath176 and @xmath177 are unlimited , and one can choose light staus and an appropriate @xmath178 to maximize the contribution . in this process , the value of @xmath179 and the splitting between @xmath176 and @xmath177 play an important role .",
    "it is worth noting that a light stau with mass close to dark matter may co - annihilate with the dark matter , which is helpful to avoid the overabundance of the dark matter in today s universe@xcite .",
    "* in the mssm , the chargino contribution is small and can only reach @xmath166 and @xmath180 for @xmath181 case and @xmath182 case respectively .",
    "the reason is that in the mssm , the @xmath183 coupling is induced by the @xmath184 interaction ( @xmath185 and @xmath186 and @xmath187 denote higgsino and wino respectively ) , and this coupling strength is maximized when both the higgsino and wino components of @xmath188 are sizable .",
    "we checked that , for most of the @xmath182 samples , @xmath189 and @xmath190 ( a large @xmath33 is needed for the stau contribution to enhance the diphoton rate @xcite ) so that @xmath188 is basically wino - like .",
    "consequently , its coupling to the higgs boson is weak .",
    "* in the nmssm , the largest susy contribution to the @xmath5 decay comes from the chargino loops with the correction reaching @xmath191 in optimal case , while the magnitude of the stau contribution is always smaller than @xmath192 .",
    "this is because in the nmssm with a large @xmath41 , @xmath33 is preferred to vary from 100 gev to 250 gev and @xmath115 is usually smaller than 10 @xcite . as a result , the @xmath193 coupling is relatively large , while the @xmath194 coupling can not be pushed up by the moderate @xmath195 . due to the singlet component of @xmath12 in the nmssm ,",
    "the @xmath196 coupling can be greatly suppressed ( reaching @xmath197 by our results ) so that the total width of @xmath12 is reduced by about @xmath198 in extreme case@xcite . consequently",
    ", even when the susy contributions to the decay width are small , @xmath199 can still be quite large .",
    "as we mentioned before , such a suppressed @xmath196 coupling can reduce the normalized strength of the process @xmath158 down to 0.55 , which , however , is still compatible with the current lhc data due to the large uncertainty of the measured signal strength ( @xmath200 from atlas result @xcite and @xmath201 from cms result @xcite ) .",
    "channel with that to @xmath202 channel.,width=661 ]    in fig.[fig3 ] , we show the correlation of the amplitudes for @xmath203 and @xmath1 .",
    "this figure indicates that in both the mssm and the nmssm , the top squark contribution to the amplitude of @xmath203 correlates roughly in a linear way with that of @xmath76 , and so is the chargino contribution . fig.[fig3 ] also indicates that the correlation is spoiled for the stau contribution in the mssm .",
    "we checked that this is because @xmath204 in the mssm can vary over a broad range and the dependence of the two amplitudes on @xmath204 are quite different .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath205 , @xmath206 and both @xmath207 and @xmath208 couplings approach zero by accidental cancelation . as a result ,",
    "the stau contribution to the decay @xmath15 is suppressed .",

    "the left panel indicates that for almost all mssm samples the @xmath19 partial width and the total width of the sm - like higgs boson is larger than the corresponding sm predictions .",
    "these features originate from the constructive contributions of the susy particles to @xmath15 and the enhanced width of @xmath216 respectively .",
    "interestingly , the largest increase of @xmath80 occurs when @xmath217 .",

    "we have following conclusions :    * in the mssm , although the partial width of @xmath15 can be enhanced by @xmath142 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) , due to the increase of the higgs total width and also the suppression of the @xmath222 coupling @xcite , the maximal value of @xmath199 is only 1.1 ( in comparison , @xmath218 may be as large as 2 . ) , and only when @xmath223 can @xmath224 be possible . among the sparticle contributions to @xmath199 and @xmath225 , the stau loops play the dominant role .",
    "the difference between the two signals comes from their dependence on @xmath204 , i.e. @xmath226 @xmath218 is maximized while @xmath199 is suppressed .",
    "our numerical results also indicate that , for the surviving samples of the mssm , the branching ratio of the invisible decay @xmath227 is usually smaller than @xmath191 and @xmath166 for @xmath181 and @xmath228 case , respectively , and the branching ratio of @xmath145 varies from @xmath152 to @xmath229 . * in the nmssm with a large @xmath41 , the sparticle corrections to the amplitudes of @xmath203 and @xmath76 are usually below @xmath165 , and the main mechanism to alter @xmath199 and @xmath218 is through the suppression of the @xmath196 and @xmath230 couplings by the singlet component of @xmath12 . as a result , @xmath199 and @xmath218",
    "are highly correlated and both of them vary from 0.2 to 2 .",
    "we checked that the branching ratios of the exotic decays @xmath146 may reach @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively ( these extreme cases correspond to some of the squared points in fig.5 of @xcite ) , and the branching ratio of the decay @xmath145 varies in a large range , from @xmath154 to @xmath233 .",
    "* in the cmssm and nmssm , @xmath199 and @xmath218 are slightly and strongly suppressed respectively . as discussed before ,",
    "in the cmssm the suppression is due to the increase of @xmath77 partial width , while in nmssm it is due to the open up of the exotic decay channels @xmath234 .",
    "note that the open up of the exotic decays @xmath146 will generally lead to the suppression of visible signal rates such as @xmath218 and @xmath235 , and as analyzed in @xcite , the latest higgs data require that the total branching ratio of the exotic decays should be less than @xmath236 at @xmath237 c.l .. this conclusion again indicates that the nmssm and also some samples of the nmssm are disfavored by the current higgs data ( about this conclusion , one may also see the squared points in fig.5 of @xcite ) . for the decay @xmath238 in the nmssm",
    ", we checked that @xmath239 varies from about @xmath240 to @xmath241 , and @xmath148 mainly decays to @xmath10 ( with a branching ratio at about @xmath130 ) and @xmath242 ( with the branching ratio at about @xmath243 ) .",
    "so in this case , the decay product of the higgs boson is four @xmath244-jets , or four @xmath245 leptons or two @xmath244-jets plus two @xmath245 leptons , which is an interesting but challenging signal in higgs search at the lhc@xcite .",
    "since @xmath239 is usually heavier than @xmath246 , the constraint from the decay @xmath247 @xcite is irrelevant here .",
    "also note that generally speaking , the constrained model such as cmssm tends to predict strong correlations among observables due to the unified nature of its parameters .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig.[fig5 ] for the cmssm in comparison with the other three models .     and",
    "@xmath248 in the four models.,width=661 ]    since the @xmath4 collider at @xmath249 provides a clean environment to detect the decays @xmath0 and @xmath250 , we also investigate their rates at the ilc defined in eq.([ilc1 ] ) and eq.([ilc2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "this figure exhibits following features    * in the mssm , a suppressed @xmath5 signal ( compared with its sm prediction ) tends to correspond to an enhanced @xmath10 signal , and an enhanced @xmath5 signal requires the @xmath10 signal rates to be roughly at its sm prediction . in any case , the enhancement factor for the two signals are less than 1.2 .",
    "note that there exist a few cases where the @xmath10 signal rate is slightly suppressed .",
    "* in the nmssm with a large @xmath41 , the normalized @xmath10 signal rate is less than 1.1 , and in some cases it may be significantly suppressed .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath5 signal rate can be either greatly enhanced or severely suppressed . in the enhancement case , the @xmath10 signal rate is usually less than its sm prediction , and the greater enhancement corresponds to the stronger suppression .",
    "* in the cmssm , both the signal rates are roughly equal to their sm predictions . in the nmssm ,",
    "however , both the rates are strongly suppressed .",
    "moreover , we checked that the @xmath3 signal rate at the ilc has similar dependence on the @xmath10 rate for the four models .",
    "in this work , we investigate the rare decay of the sm - like higgs boson , @xmath20 , and study its correlation with @xmath202 in the mssm , the nmssm , the nmssm and the cmssm .",
    "we perform a scan over the parameter space of each model by considering various experimental constraints and present our results on various planes .",
    "we have following observations :    * in the susy models , the sparticle correction to the rare decay @xmath203 is usually several times smaller than that to @xmath1 .",
    "* in the mssm , the net susy contribution to the amplitude of @xmath20 is constructive with the corresponding sm amplitude and can enhance the sm prediction by at most @xmath165 . as a result",
    ", the @xmath5 signal rates at the lhc and the ilc can be enhanced by @xmath142 at most . as a comparison",
    ", the @xmath3 rate can be enhanced by a factor of 2 due to the large stau contributions . * in the cmssm , due to the slightly enhanced total width of the sm - like higgs bson , the @xmath2 signal rates at the lhc and the ilc are both slightly below their sm predictions , and so is the @xmath8 signal .",
    "* in the nmssm with a large @xmath41 , the susy corrections to the amplitudes for the decays @xmath15 and @xmath251 are at most @xmath165 , and to get significant deviation of the two rates from their sm values , the total width of the sm - like higgs boson must be moderately suppressed by the singlet component of @xmath12 . in this model ,",
    "the two rates are highly correlated and vary from 0.2 to 2 . * in the nmssm , the signal rates of @xmath20 and @xmath202 are both greatly suppressed due to the open up of the exotic decay @xmath252 .    finally , we note that some strategies have been proposed in the literature to discriminate the considered models , e.g. , via the correlations between the higgs couplings @xcite , via the enhanced higgs pair productions at the lhc @xcite and the ilc @xcite , or via the direct dark matter detection @xcite . compared with these existing strategies , the loop - induced @xmath5 and @xmath3 decay modes of the higgs boson seem to be more sensitive to the nature of the models ( some non - susy models predict rather different correlation behavior @xcite ) .",
    "so the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath3 rates analyzed in this work may play a complementary role to discriminate new physics models in the future .    _",
    "note added :  _ after we finished this work , both the atlas and cms collaborations updated their higgs search results @xcite . among these new results ,",
    "the cms data on the diphoton signal rate is changed significantly @xcite .",
    "since in our analysis we did not use the diphoton data as a constraint ( instead we just displayed the predictions for the diphoton signal rate in different susy models ) , our results and conclusions are not affected by the new data .",
