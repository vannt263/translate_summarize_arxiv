    "scaling to large numbers of quantum bits ( qubits ) is important for the development of a future quantum information processor .",
    "several pathways toward this goal have been proposed based on using trapped atomic ions as qubits  @xcite .",
    "one particular approach envisions processing , transporting , and sympathetic cooling of ions inside a large array of traps  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with various trap architectures have demonstrated the key ingredients for scalable ion loading , trapping , processing , and transport  @xcite .",
    "current implementations of quantum information processors require a reduction of gate errors to be efficiently scalable  @xcite , necessitating stringent qubit control . in most trapped - ion quantum information experiments ,",
    "control is accomplished via laser - based techniques  @xcite , but other approaches are being investigated , e.g. , those based on magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "these methods reduce the required laser overhead and may enable a higher level of control and integration than laser - based control .",
    "while the highest entangled - state fidelity is currently obtained with laser - based operations  @xcite , magnetic - field based control may eventually provide sufficiently low errors for fault tolerant operations  @xcite .",
    "for single - qubit operations performed with microwave magnetic near fields , errors per computational gate of @xmath3 and better have been reported  @xcite .",
    "although the theoretical threshold for fault tolerance depends strongly on the assumptions of the model under study , an operational error of 10@xmath4 or below may be a reasonable starting point in a future fault - tolerant architecture .",
    "reaching this level of precision for two - qubit operations requires improvements on the state - of - the - art errors by approximately two orders of magnitude .    as with conventional computers , microfabrication may be advantageous in realizing a future quantum processor , such as those based on surface - electrode ion traps  @xcite ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to reducing the overall volume of a processor for a given number of qubits , a reduction in scale could allow for tighter confinement with trap frequencies scaling approximately as @xmath5 if all other parameters are held constant . here",
    "@xmath6 denotes a characteristic length scale of the trap , often characterized by the smallest ion - electrode distance .",
    "higher trap frequencies can enable shorter durations for transport , separation and recombination , and two - qubit operations mediated by ion motion . in the last two decades , typical trap length scales have been reduced from centimeters to tens of micrometers .",
    "this increases the oscillating magnetic near - fields ( scaling as @xmath7 ) , originating from oscillating currents running in one or multiple trap electrodes .",
    "fast and precise single - qubit rotations ( carrier transitions ) have been demonstrated in this way  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the corresponding field gradients ( proportional to @xmath5 ) can become large enough to couple the ions spin with their motional state ( sideband transitions ) on experimentally accessible timescales  @xcite . for trapped ions close to their motional ground states ,",
    "the ratio of sideband - transition rates to carrier - transition rates driven by oscillating near fields and their corresponding field gradients is on the order of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the harmonic - oscillator ground - state extent  @xcite . for typical experimental parameters",
    ", @xmath9 is on the order of @xmath10  nm , and therefore @xmath8 ranges between @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the smallest traps today .",
    "further reduction in trap size would increase this ratio , enabling faster spin - motional entanglement .",
    "for the same reason , near - field gradients are typically not useful for larger ( @xmath13 m ) trap structures .",
    "the main practical limitation to size reduction has been `` anomalous '' motional heating , caused by electric - field noise at the positions of the ions in excess of johnson noise from the resistances of the electrodes and of their filters  @xcite .",
    "anomalous noise fields have been phenomenologically modeled as originating from potential fluctuations of surface patches or dipoles with typical dimensions much smaller than @xmath6 , which yields a noise spectral density that scales as @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath6 is decreased , the resulting heating grows faster than trap frequencies , oscillating near fields , and their corresponding gradients .",
    "consequently , this form of heating appears to prevent scaling to even smaller trap dimensions .",
    "however , recent studies have demonstrated a substantial reduction of anomalous heating by cooling the electrodes  @xcite and by treatment of the electrode surfaces  @xcite .",
    "such methods may enable the further reduction in trap size .    in the experiments described here ,",
    "we investigate building blocks for oscillating magnetic near - field quantum control of trapped ions  @xcite ; a similar approach is pursued in  @xcite . to test the basic scheme , we integrated three microwave current - carrying electrodes into a room - temperature surface - electrode trap with @xmath15 m . frequencies of the microwave currents are tuned to near resonance with hyperfine transitions in @xmath0mg@xmath1 ( nuclear spin @xmath16 ) .",
    "the resulting magnetic field at the position of the ions determine the carrier coupling , while the magnetic - field gradient couples the hyperfine levels ( spin states ) to the motional degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "we previously reported on fast - carrier transitions and generation of two - ion entanglement  @xcite ; the entanglement was produced with a two - qubit gate operation  @xcite suitable for scalable quantum information processing . in this report , we give a more detailed account of our experimental setup and the procedures for calibrating and optimizing the operation of the system .    in sec .",

    "the stray potential might be caused by work function variations on the electrode surface  @xcite ( e.g. , from varying mg contamination ) or stray charges localized in the central region of the trap chip .",
    "one way of modeling modeling the stray effects is a rectangular patch with size @xmath260 m and @xmath261 m located on the chip surface , whose center is displaced by @xmath262 m , @xmath263 m relative to the trap center and that is biased to @xmath264  v ( typical work function differences can exceed one volt ) .",
