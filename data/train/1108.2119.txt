    "macroscopic phase coherence is one of the key properties of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , and has been a topic of longstanding interest .",
    "almost as soon as becs were created in the lab , this astounding property was demonstrated and investigated with respect to both spatial and temporal phase coherence @xcite .",
    "understanding phase evolution is key to the development of applications such as interferometry using condensates , and a great deal of work has been done in this area , see for example @xcite .",
    "in addition , probing dynamic correlation functions by bragg scattering is by now a mature technology @xcite .",
    "while much progress has been made , fundamental questions still remain over the nature of phase fluctuations with regard to the role of geometry and finite - temperature interactions @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a harmonic trapping potential adds complexity to the theoretical description of the gas , and the geometry of the trap dramatically alters the phase coherence properties @xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "phase coherence can be spatially extensive and long - lived , even at finite temperatures @xcite ; in a tightly confined trap within the one dimensional limit , however , long range coherence is lost over the length of the condensate , and quasicondensates of length shorter than the system form . in this regime",
    ", theory has been developed @xcite to calculate the coherence time of the system , and has seen good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "the cross - over regime between the 1d and 3d limits is significantly more complex at finite temperature , and formalism is required that can accurately describe the full - dimensional trapped cloud , and capture the interactions in the system exactly .",
    "one appropriate class of formalisms are the so - called c - field methods , which have already had much success in calculating correlations within the finite temperature bec @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the transition region between the 1d and 3d limits .",
    "we make analytical calculations in the two extremes , and then develop formalism with the projected gross pitaevskii equation ( pgpe ) @xcite to numerically study the cross - over region and compare with our analytic results .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : system ] with our system and correlation definitions .",

    "our system is described by the second quantized hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the single particle hamiltonian , @xmath2 is the quantum bose field operator , and @xmath3 is the interaction strength , with @xmath4 the s - wave scattering length . the trap potential is given as @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the trap frequencies .    in this work",
    "we will study the phase correlations within a system with respect to time .",
    "the phase correlation function between two points @xmath7 and two times @xmath8 is given as @xmath9 where the average is taken over realizations of field configurations .",
    "we also define a spatially averaged autocorrelation function , @xmath10 where the points @xmath11 are chosen to lie in the interior of the cloud where the density is high .",
    "this autocorrelation function gives the phase correlation of a single point in the system with respect to time , and we indicate this with the subscript @xmath12. we also define the two point autocorrelation function @xmath13 where both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are taken at interior points of system 1 and system 2 , where the respective densities are high .",

    ", we define the asymmetry parameter @xmath19 and the oscillator lengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we assume first @xmath22 , so that the excitation of normal modes in the perpendicular direction can be neglected .",
    "for the case we consider , it is assumed that the interaction energy is high enough that the condensate occupies several trap modes , which enables us in the analytical calculations to treat the condensate wave function in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and finally @xmath25    the calculation of autocorrelation functions for a bose gas in the bogoliubov approximation was outlined in refs .",

    "to contrast , we now treat analytically the case of a spherical condensate , with @xmath52 .",
    "the excitation spectrum is given by @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 are positive integers .",

    "motivated by the need to develop tractable theory to describe experimentally realistic systems , we now move to a system intermediary to the quasi 1d and spherical 3d systems , that is to say , the elongated bose gas .",
    "we develop the pgpe method to calculate temporal phase correlations in a three dimensional bose gas at finite temperature . in this particular work",
    ", we note that it has a key advantage over bogoliubov methods : the ease with which this method can accurately calculate temporal correlations for a wide variety of physical applications .",
    "we demonstrate this later in section [ sec : results ] by calculating results for differing trap aspect ratios and temperatures .",
    "in what follows , we give an overview of the pgpe method , and our sampling method for studying data .",
    "more details on the pgpe and c - field methods can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the key aspect of this formalism is that the bose field operator is separated into two parts , dependent on the mean occupation of modes in the system .",
    "this splitting is written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the coherent region c - field   and @xmath61 is the incoherent field operator @xcite .",
    "these fields are defined as the low and high energy projections of the full quantum field operator , separated by the energy @xmath62 . in our theory",
    "this cutoff is implemented in terms of the harmonic oscillator eigenstates @xmath63 of the time - independent single particle hamiltonian i.e. @xmath64 , with @xmath65 the respective eigenvalues .    in general , the applicability of the pgpe approach to describing the finite temperature gas relies on an appropriate choice for @xmath62 , so that the modes at the cutoff have an average occupation of order unity .",
    "this choice means that all the modes in @xmath66 are appreciably occupied , justifying the use of a classical field for these modes .",
    "in contrast the @xmath67 region contains many sparsely occupied modes that are particle - like and would be poorly described using a classical field approximation .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath60 is the pgpe @xmath68 where the projection operator @xmath69 formalises our basis set restriction of @xmath60 to the @xmath66 region .",
    "the main approximation used to arrive at the pgpe is to neglect dynamical couplings to the incoherent region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66 and @xmath67 regions are then treated as independent systems in thermal and diffusive equilibrium .",
    "an important feature of eq .",
    "( [ pgpe ] ) is that it is ergodic , so that the microstates the classical field @xmath60 evolves through in time form a sample of the equilibrium microstates , and time - averaging can be used to obtain macroscopic equilibrium properties .",
    "the procedure for finding equilibrium states including detail on using appropriate input states is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here , we focus on the method necessary for studying time correlations in the system .",
    "we define the temporal correlation function for the coherent region as @xmath70 i.e. we replace the full bose field operator with the coherent region c - field .",
    "analogues of @xmath71 and @xmath72 follow from this , as previously .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite it was shown that the contribution to the spatial phase correlation function by the incoherent region was negligible , as any contribution was due only to thermal atoms and existed over very short range . here",
    "we neglect the incoherent region when calculating phase correlations .",
    "contribution from purely thermal atoms are of course already in the coherent region , via the higher energy modes included there .",
    "we approximate the average in eq .",
    "[ g1_classical ] with an ensemble average .",
    "our procedure for calculating phase correlations within the pgpe is as follows :    * create an ensemble of 40 input states each with different random fluctuations , and evolve these within the pgpe * at equilibrium , calculate @xmath73 for each of the 40 simulations * perform the average over the ensemble of 40 simulations to calculate @xmath74 .",
    "in this section we present the results of the application of our pgpe formalism to a cold bose gas .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath75na atoms in the elongated traps with frequencies @xmath76hz and @xmath77hz .",
    "we study two temperatures at each trap , corresponding to condensate fractions 45@xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) and 10@xmath78 ( @xmath80 ) . as the condensate is responsible for any long - time coherence in the system , we keep the condensate number similar between the two trap symmetries , with @xmath81 for the cooler system , and @xmath82 for the hotter .",
    "we begin with a general discussion of the properties of the densities of our four different systems .",
    "a density slice in the @xmath83 plane is shown for each in fig [ density ] ( see caption ) .",
    "the density graphs show one instance of the distribution as it evolves in time .",
    "the three dimensional pgpe is ergodic , and as such , each simulation evolves through the set of allowable microstates . in this way , a single shot from a pgpe simulation can be likened to a single shot from an experiment - i.e. , it gives a microstate rather than an equilibrium average .",
    "this dynamic quality can easily be seen in the four microstates shown in fig . [ density ] , where the density for each is highly irregular .    ,",

    "this is perhaps most striking in fig [ density]b , where high temperature and high aspect ratio cause the density to form discrete high density clumps , as seen in the separated circular features approximately halfway down the figure .",
    "the autocorrelation is calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ g1_classical ] ) , and the results are presented in fig [ auto_fig ] for our four systems ( see caption ) .",
    "the autocorrelation for all cases comprises of three distinct parts : an initial sharp decay , subsequent larger decay , and long - term quasiperiodic behaviour .     for four systems of study : variables given in figure.,width=336 ]",
    "the initial sharp decay occurs on a timescale @xmath56 for all systems , and represents the initial loss of coherence over short timescales by the thermal modes of the system .",
    "this is due to the significant proportion of the thermal cloud included in the pgpe description .",
    "the subsequent decay in autocorrelation is due to the changing phase of the condensate in each system with respect to time , and it is this feature of the autocorrelation that differs so markedly between each system .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the proportion of condensate present in a system affects how quickly it will decohere , as can be seen by comparing curves of different temperature and same trap ( see caption ) .",
    "perhaps more surprising is the marked difference that the aspect ratio of the trap makes to the decay in coherence . for simulations with similar condensate fraction and number , but different aspect ratios ,",
    "the tighter trap leads to a much more rapid decoherence , as can be seen by comparing simulations of similar temperature and different aspect ratio .",
    "for the two @xmath79 systems ( figure ( 2 ) , top two curves ) the @xmath85 system has @xmath86 at @xmath87s , while the @xmath84 system has @xmath88 .",
    "this is a large difference for the very modest changes in aspect ratio we simulate .",
    "this more rapid phase decoherence is due to the lack of a spatially extensive condensate in the @xmath84 case causing greater phase fluctuation along the system length .    following this decay",
    ", there is quasiperiodic behaviour in the system , shown as a period of revival and further decays of the autocorrelation function , on the timescale @xmath89 .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction from our bogoliubov anaylsis results .",
    "there can also be seen on both curves a fine structure noise .",
    "this occurs at a frequency of @xmath90 , and is due to fluctuations in the tight dimensions of the trap .",
    "we note that the pgpe description includes the effects and interactions of all appreciably occupied modes , and for these systems , there are several modes in the tight direction that are occupied .",
    "since we are interested only in coherence along the long axis , we made no further analysis of these fluctuations .    in order to make a quantitative comparison of our results with those of section [ sec : bog ] , we plot @xmath91 against @xmath92 , and extract the gradient from the line of best fit .",
    "results are given in table [ tab : allfits ] , both for very short times @xmath93 and short times @xmath94 .",
    "comparing our results , we see that at very short times , all results correspond approximately to @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath47 as expected . for @xmath96 , however , it is found that the exponent is different for each case . from bogoliubov analysis ,",
    "the expected result for the exponent of the decay is @xmath97 for the 3d case , and @xmath98 for the 1d case .",
    "the results for aspect ratio @xmath85 trap confirm that this system is still well within the 3d regime . for aspect ratio @xmath84",
    "however , it can be seen that the results are intermediary to the two predictions .",
    "this can be explained in terms of the relative temperature to tight aspect ratio in our simulations . for aspect ratio 10 ,",
    "the temperature required for excitations in the tight trap direction is @xmath99nk , and the temperature of the cooler system is ten times this , and shows clear excitation of the axial modes . with an aspect ratio 20 , @xmath100nk , and",
    "the simulation presented here has a temperature 8 times this value . in this case",
    ", it can be seen that more of the axial modes are frozen out , and the fitting of the exponent gives a result intermediary to the 1d and 3d limits , as expected .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it can also be seen in the fitted results that the exponent at times @xmath96 decreases with increasing temperature , leading to a faster decay in @xmath101 .",

    ", we calculate the frequency spectrum of the system from the autocorrelation function as @xmath102 the corresponding power spectra for the four systems are shown in figure [ fourier ] . for @xmath85 , at low temperature we see a set of well defined peaks close to the 1d bogoliubov frequencies given in eq .",

    "the finite temperature bose gas is a nontrivial system displaying complex properties of phase coherence .",

    "we develop formalism based on the pgpe to numerically study these symmetries , and compare this to our results from bogoliubov analysis of the 1d and spherical limits .",
    "it is found that systems with aspect ratio 10 and 20 both give exponents for the decay of the correlation time that are intermediate to the 1d and 3d limits .",
    "this can be explained in terms of the finite temperature of the system causing excitations to be present in the tight directions of the trap , placing our systems of study deeply within the 1d to 3d crossover region .    for experimental studies of the phase evolution of the systems studied here , a splitting and recombination method @xcite would be impractical , since with reasonably high temperatures , splitting and recombining in real space is too slow to capture the initial decay of phase coherence . in this case",
