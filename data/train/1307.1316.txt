    "although a substantial fraction of the total angular momentum should be lost during the collapse , the stars that are formed inherit angular momentum , and rotation is a natural feature among their characteristics ( see p. hennebelle and a. belloche in this volume ) .",
    "+ this fact being established conceptually and observationally ( see   [ s - obs ] ) , the question that remains is whether rotation significantly affects the structure , evolution and nucleosynthesis of stars , and if so , how and to what extent .",
    "+ these are the questions within the scope of this lecture , where i will briefly summarize the observational evidences of stellar rotation (   [ s - obs ] ) , review the expected effects on the stellar structure and how they can be taken into account in stellar evolution modelling (   [ s - struc ] ) .",
    "i will also describe the main transport mechanisms that could be driven by rotation in stellar interiors (   [ s - transport ] ) and how angular momentum evolution can be followed in stellar evolution codes (   [ s - rotmod ] ) . in the last part (   [ s - evolution ] ) , i will present some key results obtained with rotating stellar evolution models .",
    "the rotation of stars was first evidenced by galileo galilei ( @xcite ) in the case of the sun , and in the late nineteenth - early twentieth century , the development of spectroscopy allowed astronomers to first envision to measure the rotation of stars by studying the broadening of the spectral lines that should result from it ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ direct measurements of the rotation rate of stars are accessible via    * _ photometry _ light curve modulation by rotation allows to derive rotation periods p@xmath0 ; * _ spectroscopy _ spectral lines broadening is partly due to surface rotation and an estimation of the projected surface velocity on the line of sight , @xmath1 can be obtained from spectral analysis ; * _ spectropolarimetry and doppler imaging _ modulation of the polarized signal by rotation allowing to derive rotation periods p@xmath0 and surface latitudinal differential rotation @xmath2 ; * _ asteroseismology _ splitting of oscillation modes due to rotation allows the reconstruction of the rotation profile of some stars in addition to the sun ; * _ interferometry _ direct imaging of rapidly rotating non - spherical stellar surfaces allows to estimate the mean rotation rate as a fraction of the break - up velocity .            for some types of stars",
    "it is very difficult to actually derive a rotation rate , either because the spectral lines broadening is dominated by another process , as surface convection , which is the case of red giants and supergiants , or because the actual stellar surface is not accessible to observation , as it is the case for wolf - rayet stars , in which the dense winds yield the formation of spectral lines in the wind and not in the hydrostatic regions that could define an actual stellar surface , preventing any measurement of stellar rotation .",
    "+ the rotational study of stars based on these measurements allows us to draw some sort of rotational hr diagram :      @xmath1 measurements in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds indicate that these are rapidly rotating stars , with a mean projected velocity of about 130 km.s@xmath3 for b - type stars ( @xcite ) , and about 110 km.s@xmath3 for o - type stars ( @xcite ) . some stars in the on subtype ( with nitrogen enrichment ) can reach projected velocities of about 420 km.s@xmath3 ( @xcite ) but the number of these very rapid rotators is actually limited .      a large survey of a and f type stars allowed royer and collaborators ( see @xcite and references therein ) to establish a good statistic for their typical rotation .",
    "these are generally rapid rotators , @xmath4 km.s@xmath3 , although the velocity distribution is more complex when going into more details for each subtype .",
    "for instance , a significant fraction of late a - type stars rotate at more than 50% of their break - up velocity",
    ". actually part of the fast rotating stars imaged with interferometry and rotating near the break - up limit are a - type stars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "red giant stars are generally slow rotators , with surface velocities lower than about 10 km.s@xmath3 ( @xcite ) . however , some of them present unusually higher projected velocities ( @xmath5 km.s@xmath3 ) as evidenced by @xcite . also evidenced from asteroseismic data ,",
    "they have been interpreted as the result of some peculiar events that may occur during this phase .",
    "a large effort has been dedicated to measure rotation periods via photometric surveys of open clusters sampling a wide range of ages ( see monitor project for instance , and j. bouvier this volume for more details ) .",
    "these studies show that from an essentially bi - modal distribution of p@xmath0 at young ages , the rotation converges to a single low p@xmath0 ( for solar - type stars ) or high p@xmath0 ( for very low - mass stars - m - type ) at the age of the hyades .",
    "+ these direct measurements testify the stellar rotation and indicate in some cases as those shown in fig .",
    "[ f - gravdark ] , that it can lead to significant departures from the spherical symmetry .",
    "they also show that the stellar angular velocity ( and angular momentum ) differs according to spectral type , and thus stellar mass but also time , and that it evolves with time along the stellar life .",
    "thanks to helioseismic data from the soho satellite ( @xcite ) and much more recently to the instruments on - board the corot and kepler satellites ( @xcite ) , an insight to the _ internal rotation profile _ of the sun and of a large number of red giant stars has become available .",
    "this opens a completely new road for our understanding of stellar structure and angular momentum distribution and constitutes extremely valuable constraints to stellar models .",
    "+ solar - like oscillations are due to the trapping of sound waves excited by convection . assuming a spherical star , such oscillations appear as a discrete spectrum of degenerate modes characterized by their radial order @xmath6 and their spherical harmonic degree @xmath7 .",
    "the azimuthal number @xmath8 is degenerated , a degeneracy that is completely lifted by rotation as well as other aspherical perturbations .",
    "+ in the sun , the pressure modes ( @xmath9-modes ) are trapped in relatively superficial cavities and probe the convective envelope and part of the underlying radiative interior , the solar core remaining unprobed .",
    "gravity modes on the other hand ( @xmath10-modes ) are generally confined to inner cavities , and scarcely appear at the surface .",
    "they could probe the solar core but do not appear at the solar surface and are extremely difficult to detect : after 14 years of soho data integration , only @xmath10-mode candidates have been tentatively identified ( @xcite ) . in red giant stars , the situation was discovered to be unexpectedly simpler , since mixed gravity / pressure modes have been detected .",
    "these modes correspond to the coupling of gravity waves in the interior to pressure waves in the envelope and give unprecedented insight on the internal properties of red giant stars . + figure  [ f - astero ] displays the inverted radial rotation profile of the sun ( @xcite ) and of a subgiant in the kepler field ( @xcite ) , as well as a core rotation period - asteroseismic stellar radius plot for a sample of about 300 red giants from the kepler field ( @xcite ) .",
    "red giants appear to experience differential rotation in their interior , and hints exist that a similar behaviour could exist in the solar central regions as can be seen from panels a ) and b ) .",
    "+ another important point coming out of these data is a clear distinction between clump ( e.g. core helium burning stars ) and red giant stars ( e.g. shell hydrogen burning stars ) in terms of core rotation period ( panel d ) ) .",
    "this provides a new powerful tool to discriminate between stars belonging to these very different evolutionary phases that occupy overlapping regions in the hertzsprung - russell diagram and are thus very difficult to distinguish from classical surface parameters as temperature or magnitude .       in stars of the hyades ( _ from @xcite",
    "_ ) ; * c * number population of two types of wolf - rayet stars as a function of metallicity traced by the oxygen abundance ( _ from @xcite _ ) ; * d * he overabundances in o - type stars of the magellanic clouds ( _ from @xcite _ ) ; * e * li abundances as a function of t@xmath11 for a sample of dwarfs and subgiants in the galaxy ( _ from @xcite _ ) ; * f * nitrogen abundances in o - type stars of the smc ( _ from @xcite _ ) ]    in addition to the direct measurements , the analysis of the surface chemical properties of stars may constitute a set of evidences for transport processes occurring inside the stars , some of them being attributed to rotation - driven processes .",
    "+ `` _ abundance anomalies _ '' , e.g. departures from the predictions of classical stellar evolution models are powerful diagnostic tools to probe the efficiency of transport processes that pollute the stellar atmosphere .",
    "such transport can be of internal origin and connect regions with efficient nucleosynthesis to the surface , or from an external source when material of different chemical composition is accreted onto the star . + as all stars rotate",
    ", it is natural to first look for rotation - induced transport processes to explain the discrepancies between abundance observations and predictions of classical and standard stellar evolution models .",
    "one should nevertheless bear in mind that a degeneracy exists concerning the nature of the transport processes itself , and that if rotation - driven mechanisms can be found to be dominant in some cases , they are certainly not the only ones acting .",
    "+ those abundance variations observed at the surface of stars that reflect nucleosynthetic processes that are known to occur inside these very same stars can be considered as evidences for transport / mixing processes connecting the surface to the regions where the nucleosynthesis occurs .",
    "indeed , the abundances of the products of hydrogen burning via the pp - chains and the _ extended _ cno cycle ( including nena- and mgal- chains ) can be used to trace internal mixing when variations are observed at evolutionary phases where they are not expected from standard stellar evolution models . in red giant stars ,",
    "the presence of @xmath12-process - process is a nucleosynthesis path that involves the production of heavy elements by slow neutron captures ( @xcite ) .",
    "] at the surface may also be considered as evidence for internal mixing .",
    "figure  [ f - obsabund ] presents a set of observed abundance patterns that are used as indirect probes for internal ( rotational ) mixing : +    * lithium depletion during phases where no convective dredge - up is expected @xmath13 in low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xcite@xcite ) * lithium enrichment @xmath13 in low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xcite ) * boron and beryllium depletion @xmath13 in low- , intermediate - mass , and massive stars ( @xcite ) * carbon depletion and carbon isotopic ratio decrease @xmath13 in low - mass red giant stars , in main sequence and post main sequence massive stars ( @xcite ) * nitrogen enrichment @xmath13 in low - mass red giant stars , in main sequence and post main sequence massive stars ( @xcite ) * helium enrichment @xmath13 in massive o - type stars at low metallicity ( @xcite ) * s - process elements enrichment @xmath13 in intermediate - mass agb stars    the fact that abundance anomalies increase with decreasing metallicity may also be viewed as an evidence for rotation - driven transport inside the stars , as some of these mechanisms are expected to be more efficient as stars become more compact and bluer at low metallicity .",
    "+ population counts , in particular for the subtypes of massive stars at different evolutionary phases ( subtypes of supergiants , of wolf - rayet and o and b type stars ) can also be used as indirect probes of internal mixing ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ figure  [ f - obsabund ] presents a set of observed abundance patterns that are used as indirect probes for internal ( rotational ) mixing .",
    "+ in   [ s - evolution ] we will show how stellar evolution models of rotating stars confront to direct and indirect probes .",
    "it appears from observations that rotation may actually modify the shape of stars , their lifetimes , their surface parameters and abundances .",
    "these evidences constitute a strong incitement to actually include rotation and associated physical processes in stellar evolution modelling .",
    "+ in this section , i present the different approaches , prescriptions and techniques that are used in stellar evolution codes to account for the direct effects of rotation on the stellar structure and evolution , leaving rotation - induced transport of angular momentum and nuclides for   [ s - transport ] .      a star is a continuous plasma that should be described by fully tri - dimensional hydrodynamical equations :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the density ; @xmath16 is the macroscopic velocity ; p is the total pressure ( given by the equation of state ) ; @xmath17 is the gravitational potential derived from the poisson equation @xmath18 ; @xmath12 is the specific entropy ( defined by the second principle of thermodynamics ) ; t is the local temperature ; @xmath19 is the energy production rate par unit mass and time ; @xmath20 is the heat flux ; @xmath21 is the thermal conductivity tensor ; @xmath22 is the volumetric abundance of chemical species @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the microscopic velocity of particles of species @xmath23 ; @xmath25 is the rate of destruction ( if @xmath26 or @xmath7 are equal to @xmath23 ) or production of species @xmath23 by unit volume and time for a particle of species @xmath23 .    when studying a non - rotating , weakly or non - magnetic single star , pressure and gravity are the only forces acting on a mass element .",
    "the resulting spherically symmetric configuration allows to reduce the problem of stellar evolution to the resolution of a set of equations that only depend on time and one spatial coordinate .",
    "+ instead of the natural eulerian formulation that would derive from expressing the above listed equations as a function of the radius @xmath27 only , the lagrangian formulation is normally preferred .",
    "the spatial coordinate is now the mass @xmath8 associated to a radius @xmath27 and the resulting set of stellar structure equations is the following :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the lagrangian derivative equal to @xmath30 ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the nuclear , neutrinic , and gravitational energies resp . ;",

    "+ these equations need to be complemented by ( 1 ) an equation of state @xmath44 , ( 2 ) an expression for the mean rosseland opacity of the plasma , @xmath45 ( in most stellar evolution codes , opacities are tabulated ) , ( 3 ) a network of nuclear reactions rates @xmath46 , ( 4 ) an equation for energy production / losses by neutrinos @xmath47 and ( 5 ) a description of the energy transport by convection to obtain @xmath48 .",
    "+ the convective flux , hence the temperature gradient @xmath49 , is generally derived from the mixing length theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the formulation by kippenhahn & weigert ( 1970 ) gives : @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the pressure scale height .",
    "@xmath52 is the so - called `` _ mixing length _ '' over which a fluid elements dissolves completely into its surroundings , with @xmath53 a parameter of order unity that is calibrated by having a 1 m@xmath54 model reproducing the sun s radius , luminosity and temperature at the age of the sun .",
    "@xmath55 is the temperature gradient of the fluid element .",
    "the mechanical equilibrium of a star is modified when rotation is taken into account , because the rotating star is not spherical any more .",
    "this departure from spherical symmetry translates into    * the deformation of the equipotential surfaces ; * the reduction of the effective gravity away from the rotation axis by centrifugal forces ; * the variation of the radiative flux on equipotential surfaces ( von zeipel effect ) .",
    "this list reveals immediately that rotation calls for a multi - dimensional description of the stellar structure .",
    "however , this is a real challenge for stellar evolution modelling , stellar evolution being meant here as the _ integration of all evolutionary phases from birth to final stages_. the difficulty arises from the huge variety of spatial and temporal scales involved ( about 10@xmath56 and 10@xmath57 orders of magnitude for spatial and temporal scales respectively for solar - type star if microscopic processes and convection are to be treated properly ) .",
    "+ although great efforts are devoted to move from the 1d picture to a 2d ( see also rieutord this volume , and @xcite ) or 3d modelling ( @xcite ) , the stellar evolution models presently in use to interpret most of observations are the result of 1d modelling    [ ]      two families of historical approaches exist to evaluate the shape of a rotating fluid : the _ maclaurin s spheroids _ , which assume that the rotating fluid , e.g. the star , is a body of constant density and uniform angular velocity , and the _ roche equipotentials _ which assume that the gravitational potential @xmath17 is the same as if the total mass of the star were concentrated at the centre .",
    "+ in each of these families , the total potential writes as the sum of the gravitational potential and of the potential from which the centrifugal acceleration derives when the star is _",
    "barotropic_.    although none of these visions are correct , the roche model is much more appropriated to model a star and is very commonly used .",
    "+ for a barotropic star , the centrifugal acceleration derives from a potential @xmath58 @xmath59 with @xmath12 the distance from the rotation axis , and @xmath60 the angular velocity .",
    "+ on the other hand , the gravitational potential is defined by @xmath61 and is spherically symmetric in the roche approximation so that @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the gravitational constant and @xmath8 is the mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath27 .    in the roche approximation ,",
    "the total potential thus writes @xmath64    the stellar surface is an equipotential , @xmath65 const . as the centrifugal force vanishes at the poles ,",
    "the following equation can thus be used to define the stellar surface :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the total mass and radius of the star , and @xmath69 is the polar radius .",
    "its critical value , obtained where the gravity exactly compensates the centrifugal acceleration in the equatorial plane is : @xmath70    figure  [ f - roche ] represents the stellar surface in reduced radius units for different rotation rates as indicated on the graph .",
    "we can see that up to @xmath71 , the equatorial radius increase is lower than 10% , and only for the very rapid rotators should we expect a strong distortion .",
    "this remark is important as it justifies a perturbative approach to model the evolution of most rotating stars .",
    "noticing that pressure @xmath72 and density @xmath15 are constant on equipotentials if the potential is conservative , kippenhahn & thomas ( 1970 ) propose to re - write the stellar structure equations on these equipotentials , that can be distorted and thus account for the spherical symmetry departure induced by rotation .",
    "+ so let s @xmath73 be a conservative potential , and equipotentials be defined as surfaces where @xmath65 const . for the potential to be conservative ,",

    "these temperatures are reached when the star is still fully convective , so that the destruction of lithium in the core regions immediately shows up at the surface .",
    "when the radiative core appears , li burning may still be going on but in the absence of any transport mechanisms in the radiative interior to connect the now receding convective envelope , li surface abundance is expected to remain constant . when rotational mixing is taken into account , mendes ( 1999 ) , eggenberger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and marques & goupil ( 2013 ) obtain an additional surface li depletion ( as expected if the rotational mixing is efficient ) that remains marginal ( does not exceed 0.25 dex according to @xcite ) .",
    "+ an important point made by marques & goupil ( 2013 ) is that despite the small effect on the pms , rotation may significantly affect the evolution of the lithium abundance further at the zams and beyond , depending on the initial conditions and particularly on the assumed rotation period during the ctt ( disc - locking ) phase .",
    "this effect is seemingly due to the gradients of angular velocity hence the amount of shear that can develop in the radiative regions where li is being processed .",
    "it is thus crucial to properly account for rotation - induced transport during the early phases .",
    "+ surface angular velocity + the surface angular velocity evolution during the pms of solar - type stars is first controlled by the so - called _ disc - locking _ , and the rotation period is imposed in stellar evolution codes so as to best fit the data from young open clusters .",
    "the duration of this phase is not completely established and could vary between 3 and 6 to 9 myrs for solar - type stars according to the initial velocity ( see @xcite ) . during that time , the _ surface angular velocity @xmath354 _ is maintained constant while the star rapidly contracts .",
    "models indicate that for longer disc - locking phases , the angular velocity at the zams is slower .",
    "once the disc - locking phase is over , the constant surface angular velocity constrain is released , the surface of the star is spun up due to the global reduction of the stellar radius and to the now quasi - conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the later the disc - decoupling occurs , the less contraction is expected and so the less spin up . on the other hand , the magnetized winds ( see   [ s - wind ] ) will also act during this phase and prior to the arrival on the zams , and limit the spin - up of the surface .",
    "+ the evolution of the surface angular velocity from the disc decoupling to the zams is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - rotprof1msun ] where we show the internal rotation profiles at different ages for models only including rotation hydrostatic effects and rotation - driven transport and for models additionally including the transport by igw ( @xcite ) . + internal rotation profile",
    "+ when the transport by igw in the radiative interior is neglected ( which should not be done as we shall show below ) , the meridional circulation and the hydrostatic terms control the transport of angular momentum and build up of differential rotation with a negative gradient of angular velocity ( the core rotates faster than the surface ) . when the surface constrain is released after disc decoupling , the surface",
    "is spun up but the transport and the core contraction are efficient enough to maintain and even exacerbate the differential rotation as can be seen on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f - rotprof1msun ] .",
    "+ according now to what has been explained in   [ s - igw ] , igw are likely to be efficient to transport angular momentum during the pms evolution , and it is actually the case as soon as the radiative core appears in the star and the waves have a radiative region to propagate and dissipate into . the low - degree , low - frequency waves are those experiencing the largest doppler shift due to differential rotation and they penetrate deep in the core regions where they deposit negative angular momentum , thus efficiently spinning down these regions as can be seen on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f - rotprof1msun ] . on the other hand , closer to the surface the angular velocity gradient",
    "is not modified so that the effect of igw can not be detected by confronting rotation periods .",
    "+ such rotation profiles however will imply a radically different evolution for the further evolution beyond the zams , in particular when the effect of the magnetized winds will be at its maximum .",
