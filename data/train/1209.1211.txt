    "the discovery of superconductivity in the lnfeaso ( ln = la , ce , pr , sm ) family of compounds with critical temperatures ( @xmath2 ) up to 56  k @xcite promoted an intense search for novel fe - based superconductors with similar crystal structure . within a few months , several new superconducting phases were discovered . among them , tetragonal fese has the nominally simplest crystal structure .",
    "it has no charge reservoir layer separating the fe@xmath9se@xmath9 layers and , hence , is considered as parent compound to all the fe - based pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors.@xcite the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath2 ) is found to be extremely sensitive to the fe : se ratio , and the highest @xmath10  k at ambient pressure is observed when the compound is closest to the stoichiometric composition.@xcite nevertheless , application of pressure to fese raises @xmath2 as high as @xmath11  k.@xcite by substituting te for se , @xmath2 is enhanced to @xmath12  k for about 50% te doping.@xcite the end member fe@xmath0te is non - superconducting and exhibits an incommensurate antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order , coupled to a structural distortion near 67  k.@xcite the incommensurability @xmath13 in fe@xmath0te can be easily tuned by the value of @xmath14 , and the afm order becomes commensurate for the samples close to the stoichiometric composition ( i.e. , @xmath15 0).@xcite in mixed fe@xmath0te@xmath16se@xmath17 , the magnetic order is found to survive as short - range correlations for the samples with 0.25 @xmath18 0.49 even in the superconducting state.@xcite more recently , pressure - induced static magnetic order is observed in superconducting fese.@xcite density functional theory ( dft ) calculations@xcite on the stoichiometric end members fese and fete indicate fermi surface ( fs ) structures very similar to those in fe - pnictides , where a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ground state is obtained due to fs nesting .",
    "in contrast to the dft predictions , recent neutron diffraction studies demonstrate a composition - tunable ( @xmath19 , @xmath19 ) afm order , which propagates along the diagonal direction of the fe - square lattice in the @xmath20-plane.@xcite this is unlike fe - pnictides , where the propagation vector of the sdw - type afm order is along the ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) edge of the fe - square lattice.@xcite in fact , a sdw gap was not observed in fe@xmath0te , @xcite and fs nesting is not considered as the origin of magnetic order .",
    "alternatively , a fluctuating - local - moment scenario has been invoked in order to explain the unusual magnetic properties of fe@xmath0te.@xcite    at this point , it is worthwhile to mention that the phase diagram of the fe chalcogenides is extremely complex . in the case of fese , non - superconducting phases such as fe@xmath23se@xmath24 , fe@xmath25se@xmath26 , and hexagonal fese form in close proximity in the temperature - composition phase diagram.@xcite hence , the tetragonal superconducting phase might contain these secondary phases in small quantities .",
    "further , the synthesis procedure is prone to oxygen contamination and thus producing unwanted phases such as fe@xmath9o@xmath23 and fe@xmath23o@xmath24 .",
    "all these phases are magnetic and detrimental to superconductivity .",
    "another crucial issue in the case of fese superconductors is the role played by excess of fe .",
    "it is exceedingly difficult to obtain perfectly stoichiometric fe chalcogenides , and excess of fe appears to be always present in synthesized compounds.@xcite the excess fe ions randomly occupy interstitial sites ( designated as fe(2 ) sites ) in the chalcogenide layer.@xcite dft calculations @xcite focusing on fe@xmath0te indicate that the excess of fe occurs in the + 1 valence state with each fe@xmath27 donating approximately one carrier to the fete layer .",
    "further , fe@xmath27 is found to be strongly magnetic with a local moment of 2.4 @xmath28 .",
    "these moments can be expected to couple with the magnetism of the fete sublattice resulting in a more complex magnetic order .",
    "it is predicted that , when fete is doped with se , magnetism of interstitial fe persists and results in a pair - breaking effect in the superconducting state.@xcite indeed , recent experimental results clearly show suppression of superconductivity @xcite and localization effects @xcite induced by excess fe .",
    "here we present resistivity , magnetization , linear and non - linear response of the ac - susceptibility of nominal fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath1 single crystals for two different values of @xmath14 .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate that fe - excess causes a broadening of the superconducting transition , a phase separation in the superconducting state , and a localization of the charge - carrier in the normal state .",

    "the ampoules were kept inside the bridgman setup and the precursors were melted together at 950  @xmath36c .",
    "homogenization was done for 48 h by rotation of the melt in alternating clockwise and anticlockwise direction .",
    "after homogenization the furnace was translated at a rate of 9.2 mm / h so that a temperature gradient of 60  @xmath36c / cm swept through the ampoule .",
