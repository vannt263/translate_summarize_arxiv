    "the casimir effect can be viewed as the reflection of vacuum fluctuations by mirrors .",
    "the presence of a reflecting boundary alters the modes of a quantized field , and results in shifts in the vacuum expectation values of quantities quadratic in the field , such as the energy density .",
    "typically , casimir effects for massless fields may be estimated by dimensional analysis .",
    "if @xmath0 is the distance to the nearest boundary , then the casimir energy density is typically of order @xmath1 times a dimensionless constant .",
    "this constant is usually of order @xmath2 in four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "it is of course possible to find a much smaller result due to special cancellations .",
    "for example , the casimir energy density for a single , perfectly conducting plate is zero , even though the mean squared electric and mean squared magnetic fields are separately nonzero .",
    "these typical results arise from calculations of specific geometries , not from any general theorem .",
    "this leaves the possibility of exceptions , where the energy density is much larger than would be expected on dimensional grounds . indeed , one possible mechanism for amplification of vacuum fluctuations has already been proposed @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is based on the fact that the contribution of various parts of the frequency spectrum to the casimir effect is a highly oscillatory function @xcite .",
    "the contributions of different ranges of frequency almost , but not quite , completely cancel one another .",
    "the possibility that one can enhance the magnitude of the effect by altering the reflectivity of the boundary in selected frequency ranges was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we wish to propose a different mechanism for amplification of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "this is the use of parabolic mirrors to create anomalously large effects near the mirror s focus .",
    "it is well known in classical physics that a parabolic mirror can focus incident rays which are parallel to the mirror s axis .",
    "this means that a particular plane wave mode becomes singular at the focus .",
    "one might wonder whether this classical focusing effect of modes can produce large vacuum fluctuations near the focus .",
    "we will argue that the answer to this question is yes .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , the essential formalism needed to compute mean squared field averages in the geometric optics approximation will be developed .",
    "it will be argued that the dominant contributions will come from interference terms between different reflected rays . in particular ,",
    "expressions will be given for the case of two reflected rays from a single incident ray in terms of the path length difference of the two reflected rays .",
    "in sect .  [ sec : para ] the specific case of parabolic mirrors will be studied , and the condition for the existence of multiply reflected rays given .",
    "it will be shown here that there is a minimum size required for a parabolic mirror to produce large vacuum fluctuation focusing .",
    "section  [ sec : tech ] deals with a couple of technical issues , including the treatment of the apparently singular integrals which arise . in sect .",
    "[ sec : slightly ] , we give explicit results in an approximation in which the mirror is only slightly larger than the minimum size needed to focus vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the possible experimental tests of these results are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : final ] .",
    "units in which @xmath3 will be used throughout this paper .",
    "electromagnetic quantites will be in lorentz - heaviside units .",
    "the approach which will be adopted in this paper is a geometric optics approximation .",
    "this approximation assumes that the dominant contribution to the quantities which we calculate comes from modes whose wavelengths are short compared to the goemetric length scales of the system .",
    "the justification of the approximation will lie in a self - consistent calculation leading to large contributions from short wavelength modes . at first sight",
    ", it might seem that this approximation would always fail , and that only modes whose wavelengths are of the order of the goemetric length scales will contribute significantly to quantities such casimir energy densities .",
    "however , there is a circumstance in which this intuition can fail .",
    "this is when there are two or more reflected rays produced by the same incident beam .",
    "it then becomes possible to have an anomalously large interference term between these rays , as will be illustrated below .",
    "let us first consider the case of a massless scalar field , @xmath4 .",
    "let the field operator be expanded in term of normal modes as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath8 are the mode functions .",
    "the formal vacuum expectation value of @xmath9 becomes @xmath10 in the absence of a boundary , the modes @xmath8 are simply plane waves . in the presence of the boundary , there are both incident and possibly one or more reflected waves for each wave vector @xmath11 . write the mode function as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the incident wave and the @xmath14 are the reflected waves .",
    "( note that here @xmath11 denotes the incident wavevector . )",
    "we may take all of these waves to be plane waves with box normalization in a volume @xmath15 , in which case @xmath16 the @xmath14 take the same form , but with @xmath11 replaced by the appropriate wavevector for the reflected wave .",
    "if we now insert eq .",
    "( [ eq : mode ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : phisq ] ) , we obtain a sum involving both the absolute squares of the incident and the reflected waves , and the various possible cross terms between the different waves : @xmath17 \\,.\\ ] ] this quantity is divergent and needs to be renormalized by subtraction of the corresponding quantity in the absence of boundaries .",
    "we will argue in sect .",
    "[ sec : segments ] that this is given by the above sum without the cross terms : @xmath18 the renormalized expectation value is then given by the sum of cross terms @xmath19 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : phisqren}\\ ] ] the renormalization which we employ is the usual one of defining the renormalized quantity to be the difference between the formal expectation value with the mirror and that without it .",
    "another way of expressing the same prescription is to say that quantities such as @xmath20 are only defined up to an additive constant , and we choose the constant so that @xmath21 at infinite distances from the mirror .",
    "let us examine a particular cross term : @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are both of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : plane ] ) , except with @xmath11 replaced by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these might be two reflected waves , both corresponding to the same incident wavevector @xmath11 , but different reflected wavevectors , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . only the direction , not the frequency changes upon reflection , so @xmath27 we can now write @xmath28}{\\omega } \\,,\\ ] ] where the infinite volume limit has been taken .",
    "the argument of the cosine function is proportional to the difference in optical path lengths of the two rays , @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 and hence @xmath31    note that the integral in the above expression will diverge as @xmath32 in the limit that @xmath33 .",
    "thus within the geometric optics approximation , we can obtain an anomalously large contribution if there are two distinct reflected rays with nearly the same optical path length .",
    "if this is the case , it provides the self - consistent justification of the approximation .",
    "the dominant contribution to the integral will come from modes with wavelength of the order of @xmath29 ; if this is small compared to all other length scales in the problem , then the use of geometric optics should be a good approximation .",
    "normally one would expect casimir effects to arise from modes whose wavelengths are of the order of the length scales defined by the boundaries , typically the distance to the nearest boundary . in this case",
    ", one would not expect geometric optics to be a good approximation .",
    "nonetheless , schaden and spruch @xcite have argued that one can often obtain reasonable results from a semiclassical approximation involing a sum over periodic classical orbits .",
    "our use and justification of a geometric optics approximation is perhaps more akin to that of hawking @xcite in his derivation of black hole evaporation .",
    "there the modes which give the dominant contribution to the hawking radiation have very high frequencies when they propagate through a collapsing star , and hence are accurately described by geometric optics .    in this paper",
    ", we will examine the case of parabolic mirrors and show that for points near the focus , there can be two reflected rays with nearly the same path length .",
    "their path lengths differ finitely from that of the incident ray . in this case ,",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath20 comes from a single term of the form of @xmath34 , and we can write @xmath35 note that the interference terms between the incident and the reflected rays give a much smaller contribution because the @xmath36 is much larger for these terms",
    ". we can also now write down expressions for several other quantities of interest .",
    "these include @xmath37 , where the dot denotes a time derivative , as well as the scalar field energy density @xmath38 in the last step we used the fact that @xmath39 for plane wave modes .",
    "we can also obtain renormalized expectation values for electromagnetic field quantities , such as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , or the electromagnetic energy density @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the quantized electric and magnetic field operators , respectively .",

    "in this subsection , we examine the problem of the reflection of rays from a pair of attached line segments , as illustrated in fig .  4 .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is twofold : first , it will lead to the justification of the renormalization prescription used in writing down eq .",
    "( [ eq : phisqab ] ) .",
    "second , it will reveal that integrals such as those in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phisqren ] ) and ( [ eq : esqren ] ) should involve an integration over @xmath50 , the angle of the reflected wave , rather than @xmath49 , the angle of the incident wave .",

    "this conclusion will continue to hold if we have more than two straight line segments .",
    "we can approximate any curve by a sequence of line segments .",
    "in general , the angle @xmath119 subtended by the curve differs from the range of angle of incident rays , @xmath120 , and if the curve is convex toward the point of interest , @xmath121 . at first sight",
    ", one might think that an emmeration of the independent modes should involve an integration over @xmath49 .",
    "this , however , fails to account for the multiple reflected rays , which are correctly counted if we instead integrate on @xmath50 .",
    "as we vary @xmath49 through its range of @xmath122 ( note that here @xmath49 increases in the clockwise direction . )",
    ", we have six possibilities : @xmath123 in the latter case the incident ray fails to reach the point of interest because it is blocked by the mirror .",
    "note , however , that the reflected rays exactly compensate for the missing incident rays in the sense that if we add up a weighted sum of the angle ranges with reflected rays , it is equal to the range with no rays .",
    "this observation is the justification for eq .",
    "( [ eq : phisqab ] ) .",
    "the number of incident plus reflected rays in the presence of the boundary is the same as the number of incident rays in its absence .    one might ask whether it is important also to include the interference terms between the multiply refelcted rays . after all , the dominant contribution near the focus of a parabolic mirror comes from such an interference term .",
    "it is indeed true that if one wishes to compute a quantity such as @xmath40 in the geometry of fig .  4",
    ", we would need to include the interference terms .",
    "however , one should not expect to obtain an anomalously large result , but rather one of order @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the distance to the nearest boundary .",
    "this follows from the fact that the formula for @xmath29 , the analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltal ] ) will be of the form of a product of @xmath0 times a dimensionless angular dependent function .",
    "we have derived expressions , such as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phisqren3 ] ) and ( [ eq : esqren3 ] ) , for renormalized quantities near the focus of a parabolic mirror .",
    "recall that we are dealing with a situation where there are two reflected rays for a single incident ray . here",
    "@xmath124 is the angle of one of these rays , and the angle of the other , @xmath125 is understood to be a function of @xmath124 .",
    "however , the integrals in question are singular at the point that @xmath126",
    ". the singularity may be removed by an integration by parts @xcite .",
    "we rewrite the integrand using relations such as @xmath127 and @xmath128 next we perform repeated integrations by parts until we have only an integral with a logarithmic singularity in the integrand , plus possible surface terms .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath129 and @xmath130 provided that the function @xmath131 is regular at @xmath132 and the surface terms vanish .",
    "this procedure is a generalization of the notion of a principal value to cases of higher order poles .    in our case ,",
    "the integration on @xmath124 ranges over those values of @xmath133 for which there are multiple reflected rays . within the geometric optics approximation",
    ", the integrand would seem to drop precipitously to zero at the end point of this interval .",
    "if one were to go beyond this approximation , the sudden drop would be smeared out over an interval corrresponding to about one wavelength .",
    "thus we can think of our integrand as being an approximation to a function which , along with its derivatives , vanishes smoothly at the endpoints .",
    "if so , then we can ignore the surface terms . in any case",
    ", we will here make the assumption that the surface terms can be ignored .",
    "the integrand falling smoothly to zero can arise from more than one physical cause .",
    "one is diffraction effects at the edge of the mirror , as noted above .",
    "another way to enforce this behavior is to consider a mirror in which the reflectivity falls smoothly from near unity to zero as the edge of the mirror is approached .",
    "as we found above ( see fig .  2 .",
    ") , there is a critical size which a parabolic mirror must have before we find large vacuum effects near the focus .",
    "the critical case is that of a mirror which subtends an angle of @xmath69 in either direction from the axis of symmetry ( the @xmath51-axis in fig .  1 ) .",

    "if one equates the force on atom at a distance @xmath161 from the focus to its weight , the result can be expressed as @xmath183^\\frac{1}{5 } \\,.\\ ] ] given that this formula applies for @xmath184 and that @xmath185 for many metals , it seems possible that levitation near the focus is possible .",
    "of course , atoms will only be trapped if their temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "the required temperature can be estimated by setting the thermal energy @xmath186 equal to the magnitude of the potential energy @xmath15 .",
    "the result is @xmath187 thus for @xmath161 of the order of a few times @xmath188 , the required temperature is larger than the temperatures of the order of @xmath189 which have already been achieved for laser cooled atoms @xcite .",
    "another possibility might be the use of atom interferometry .",
    "atoms traveling for a time @xmath175 parallel to and near the focus of a parabolic cylinder will acquire a phase shift of @xmath190 if it is possible to localize the atoms to within a few @xmath191 of the focus , then the accumulated phase shift for reasonable flight times would seem to be within the currently attainable sensitivities of the order of @xmath192 radians @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have argued that a parabolic mirror is capable of focusing the vacuum modes of the quantized electromagnetic field and creating large physical effects near the mirror s focus . just as the mirror can focus a beam of light , it can focus something even in the absence of incoming light .",
    "this might be dubbed `` focusing a beam of dark '' @xcite .",
    "the manifestation of this focusing is a growth in the energy density and mean squared electric field as the focus is approached . in the idealized case of a perfectly reflecting mirror ,",
    "these quantities diverge as the inverse fourth power of the distance from the focus . for a real mirror",
    ", the growth is expected to saturate at distances of the order of the plasma wavelength of the mirror .",
    "the most readily observable consequence of the focused vacuum fluctuations is enhanced casimir forces on atoms or other particles near the focus .",
    "the sign of the force is such as to draw particles into the vicinity of the focus .",
    "estimates given in the previous section indicate that the magnitude of this effect may be large enough to be observable .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper were based on the geometric optics approximation in which only short wavelenth modes are considered .",
    "the justification of this approximation is self - consistency : the large effects near the focus can only come from the short wavelength modes for which the approximation should be a good one . nonetheless , in future work it will be of interest to go beyond the geometric optics approximation .",
    "this should allow one to check the validity of the assumption made in sect .",
    "[ sec : sing ] that the surface terms can be ignored .    in order to simplify the calculations",
    ", we made two restrictions on the geometry .",
    "the first is that we have assumed that the point at which the mean squared field quantites are measured lies on the symmetry axis of the parabola ( the @xmath51-axis ) .",
    "the second is that the mirror be only slightly larger than the critical angle of @xmath69 at which vacuum focusing begins .",
    "( this is the assumption that @xmath135 , made in sect .",
    "[ sec : slightly ] . )",
    "it is of interest to remove both of these restriction , which we hope to do in a future work ."
