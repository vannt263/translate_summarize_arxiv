    "the last three years have seen a torrent of new milky way ( mw ) satellites being discovered in the northern hemisphere , almost doubling the number known prior to 2005 : botes ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006a ) , canes venatici ( zucker et al .",
    "2006a ) , willman 1 ( willman er al .",
    "2005a ) , ursa major ( willman et al .",
    "2005b ) , ursa major ii ( zucker et al .  2006a ) , hercules , coma berenices , segue 1 , canes venatici ii , leo iv ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006b ) , and leo t ( irwin et al .  2007 ) .",
    "eight of these new objects are consistent in size and luminosity with dwarf spheroidal satellites while willman 1 and segue 1 straddle the intersection of dwarfs and globular clusters .",
    "coma berenices falls in an apparent void of objects spanning the @xmath7pc range ( see fig 1 .",
    "gilmore et al .",
    "these objects were all initially detected as overdensities of resolved stars in the photometric data of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) and , with the exception of leo iv , subsequently confirmed with follow - up observations .",
    "the numerous discoveries of extremely low surface brightness dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) in the  1/4 of the sky covered by sdss strongly suggests that there are many more yet undiscovered . a significant new population of dwarf",
    "satellite galaxies would go a long way to reconcile the current discrepancy between lambda cold dark matter theory predictions ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) and actual observed dsph numbers .",
    "the next few years will see the advent of digital surveys that will enable all - sky searches for milky way satellites ( e.g. panstarrs , kaiser et al .",
    "we intend to blindly scan the entire southern sky ( 20,000 square degrees ) for new mw dwarf satellites with the upcoming southern sky survey performed with the 1.3 meter anu skymapper telescope at siding spring ( keller et al .",
    "the final combined @xmath8 tb catalog of the survey is estimated to reach a signal - to - noise of 5 at @xmath9 , 1.0 mag deeper than sdss . in preparation for this survey we are testing sensitive data mining algorithms and search strategies using the freely available sdss data release 5 ( dr5 , adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) . a full overview",
    ", results and a detailed discussion will be presented in a subsequent paper ( walsh et al . in prep ) .",
    "our software test on sdss data has yielded several promising candidates , the most prominent of which we present here . while follow - up observations will reveal the candidate s true nature in more detail , its size and luminosity are consistent with those of the other recent detections that have been labeled dwarfs spheroidals .",
    "we thus follow convention and designate it botes ii .",
    "dr5 includes a five color photometric catalogue covering 8000 square degrees around the north galactic pole ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "we have searched this publicly available data for concentrations of old stars at various distance intervals out to the galactic virial radius of 250kpc .",
    "we use a method similar to that described in willman et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and willman ( 2003 ) , and described in full in walsh et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "we use a complicated set of cuts to identify all stellar sources in fields of @xmath10 height in declination and of arbitrary width in right ascension that are consistent in @xmath11 parameter space with that of a dsph at a desired distance ( red giant branch , blue horizontal branch and main - sequence turnoff ) .",
    "we then convolve the binned spatial positions of these sources with an exponential surface brightness profile and subtract the @xmath12 running mean from each @xmath13 pixel . a density threshold in standard deviations above the local mean",
    "is defined as a function of the background stellar density for each pixel , allowing us to search over fields with stellar density gradients .",
    "the process is repeated for different magnitude bins to change sensitivity with distance .    applying this method to dr5 we recovered all of the recently reported dsphs , as well as many previously known objects such as globular clusters and background galaxy clusters .",
    "the detection significance of the faintest dwarfs , quantified by the parameter @xmath14 ( maximum level above threshold density times area above threshold ) , are shown in fig.[fig : hist ] , along with the result for the new object .",
    "the solid line shows the number of `` detections '' in thirty - nine 1000 square degree randomized stellar fields each of varying stellar density to determine foreground contamination from random clustering .",
    "the newly discovered satellites ( minus segue 1 which fell outside the analyzed area ) as well as the botesii overdensity are all well above the threshold @xmath15 above which our detection algorithm statistically yields less than one false positive detection over the entire area of dr5 .",
    "the botes ii overdensity is not associated with any known galactic or extragalactic object and is consistent in @xmath11 and size - luminosity space with a new dwarf . figure [ fig : pair ] shows the position of botesii relative to botes .",
    "fig [ fig : boo2 ] shows our detections of coma berenices , botesii and botes .",
    "the contours represent the level above the threshold density , which is then multiplied by the detection area to give @xmath14 .",
    "coma berenices and botesiipeak at higher densities because they are more concentrated than botes , but the latter s spatial extent means that it is still a stronger detection .",
    "the detection of botesii is consistent in all respects with the detections of the other galactic satellites , albeit much fainter .",
    "we use sdss data to extract as much information as possible and estimate preliminary parameters for botesii . the overdensity is visible even before smoothing and the lack of a concentration of background galaxies ( figure [ fig : fits ] ) allows to exclude a galaxy cluster as an origin .",
    "looking at the cmd in figure [ fig : boo2 ] reveals a weak red giant branch and blue horizontal branch ( or red clump ) at a distance modulus apparently identical to that of botes , and similar to the coma berenices dwarf ( @xmath16 , belokurov et al .",
    "the cmd features become even more prominent in the associated area - normalized field - subtracted hess diagram .",
    "overplotted is the isochrone of a metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath17 ) , old ( 12gyr ) stellar population ( girardi et al .",
    "2004 ) to illustrate the consistency of our object with an old stellar population . using the assumed distance modulus of @xmath18 ( 60kpc ) which is the same heliocentric distance of the botes dwarf ,",
    "botesii would lie at a spatial distance of only @xmath19kpc from botes .",
    "this hints at a physical connection between the two systems , although a further discussion of this idea is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "figure [ fig : sb ] presents the azimuthally averaged stellar density profile generated from all stars with @xmath20 and @xmath21 centered on botesii .",
    "these data were then fitted with a plummer profile ( dotted line ) plus a constant ( dashed line ) , the latter to account for the foreground screen of galactic stars .",
    "the best - fitting profile has a half - light radius of @xmath22arcmin , approximately one third of the physical size of botes .",
    "alternatively , fitting an exponential profile to the data gives a half - light radius of @xmath23arcmin .",
    "we use two methods to empirically derive the total magnitude of our object .",
    "firstly we use sdss coverage of the draco dsph to calculate the flux ratio of the integrated luminosity functions .",
    "we derive a flux ratio @xmath24 .",
    "this converts into a magnitude difference of @xmath25mag and a total absolute magnitude of @xmath26mag for botesii , adopting @xmath27mag for draco ( grebel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) .",
    "the same analysis yields @xmath28 for botes , 0.7mag brighter than @xmath29 given by belokurov et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "secondly , we use the integrated surface brightness profiles of botes and botesii .",
    "the flux ratio from this method gives @xmath30 .",
    "using @xmath29 for botes gives @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore adopt a result of @xmath32 .",
    "we report a new galactic satellite called botesii , only @xmath33 degrees away from the botes dwarf .",
    "this object was discovered as a resolved stellar overdensity in an automated search of sdss dr5 .",
    "any object that is detected by our algorithm will fall in one of the following categories : random foreground clustering , galaxy clusters , stellar associations of partially resolved nearby galaxies , globular clusters , or galactic dwarf spheroidals .",
    "random clustering at this level is extremely unlikely with @xmath34 such false objects occuring in the entire dr5 area ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "the cmd shows an apparent mst and rgb structure that is unlikely to be associated with a distant galaxy cluster and no evidence is found of a suspicious accumulation of background galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ) .",
    "the combined evidences from cmd , surface brightness profile and the good agreement with the size - luminosity relationship of other mw satellites leads us to conclude this object is a previously undiscovered companion to the milky way at a tentative distance of @xmath2kpc . but is it a gc or a dsph ? traditionally , these objects are distinguished by their differing physical size ; dark matter dominated dsphs are more extended than a purely stellar system of equal luminosity .",
    "equipped with the two parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36mag for botesii we add our object to the other recently discovered dwarfs in the size - luminosity plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lr ] ) .",
    "the distinction between dsphs and gcs is blurred in the low luminosity regime as was emphasized by the discovery of willman 1 ( willman et al .",
    "botesii falls alongside coma berenices in the 40100pc region devoid of other objects , between globular clusters and dwarfs .",
    "botesii is of comparable luminosity to segue 1 , but is a factor of @xmath37 larger .    with a physical half - light size that is an order of mag larger than most gcs but similar to those of dsphs",
    ", we are inclined to designate botesii a dwarf galaxy . however , without kinematic data , it is not possible to say for certain whether or not botesii formed inside of a dark matter halo , which would confirm it as such .",
    "it is also not possible with the current data to determine the extent to which tidal effects may have shaped the observed size and luminosity of botesii .",
    "a combination of follow - up spectroscopy and deep imaging will not only enable a more robust evaluation of the dark matter content of this object , but will also enable an evaluation of a possible physical relationship between botes and botesii .",
    "funding for the sdss and sdss - ii has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national science foundation , the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the national aeronautics and space administration , the japanese monbukagakusho , the max planck society , and the higher education funding council for england .",
