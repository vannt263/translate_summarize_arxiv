    "motivated by the dark energy problem , there have been numerous attempts to modify general relativity ( gr ) at large distances ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . generally , such modifications give rise to new degrees of freedom associated with the breaking of gauge symmetries of gr . in @xmath0 gravity , for example , the lagrangian including the non - linear terms of the ricci scalar @xmath1 brings a scalar degree of freedom called `` scalarons '' in the gravitational sector @xcite .",
    "those scalar degrees of freedom can freely propagate to mediate a long - range fifth force with baryonic matter .",
    "since the gravitational experiments within the solar system agree with gr in high precision , we need to screen the fifth force at small distances while realizing the cosmic acceleration on large scales .    in modified gravitational theories",
    "there are several different ways to recover the general relativistic behavior in local regions .",
    "one is the so - called chameleon mechanism @xcite , under which the effective mass @xmath2 of a scalar field @xmath3 is different depending on the surrounding matter density . in the regions of high density with large @xmath2",
    ", a spherically symmetric body can have a thin - shell to suppress the coupling between the field and non - relativistic matter outside the body .",
    "in fact , the chameleon mechanism was applied to dark energy models based on @xmath0 theories @xcite and brans - dicke theories @xcite .",
    "there exists a similar screening scenario called the symmetron mechanism @xcite .",
    "the choices of the field potential and the matter coupling for symmetrons are different from those for chameleons .",
    "unfortunately , the energy scale of the simplest potential of symmetrons is too small to act for dark energy .",
    "while the existence of the field potentials is crucial for the success of the chameleon and symmetron mechanisms , there is another screening scenario called the vainshtein mechanism @xcite based on derivative self - interactions of a scalar degree of freedom .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism was originally discovered in the context of massive gravity ( spin-2 pauli - fierz theory @xcite ) .",
    "the helicity-0 mode of massive gravitons does not decouple from matter in a linear approximation @xcite , but the derivative self - interactions of the helicity-0 mode allow to suppress the matter coupling @xcite .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism can be at work in the dvail - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model @xcite where the cosmic acceleration is realized by a gravitational leakage to the extra dimension . in the dgp model",
    ", a non - linear field self - interaction of the form @xmath4 , which arises due to the mixture of the longitudinal and transverse gravitons , can lead to the recovery of gr within the so - called vainshtein radius @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "if we consider a probe brane embedded in a five - dimensional minkowski bulk , all the non - linear self - interactions of galileons naturally arise from the brane tension , induced curvature , and the gibbons - hawking - york boundary terms of the bulk contributions @xcite . moreover , the coupling to gravity is straightforward by taking the induced metric on the brane in the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an arbitrary four - dimensional metric . in the non - relativistic limit",
    "this approach nicely recovers the lagrangian of covariant galileons derived in refs .",

    "<S> we study how the vainshtein mechanism operates in the most general scalar - tensor theories with second - order equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the field equations of motion , which can be also applicable to most of other screening scenarios proposed in literature , are generally derived in a spherically symmetric space - time with a matter source . in the presence of a field coupling to the ricci scalar , we clarify conditions under which the vainshtein mechanism is at work in a weak gravitational background . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the solutions of the field equation inside a spherically symmetric body and show how they can be connected to exterior solutions that accommodate the vainshtein mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our general results to a number of concrete models such as the covariant / extended galileons and the dbi galileons with gauss - bonnet and other terms . in these models </S>",
    "<S> the fifth force can be suppressed to be compatible with solar - system constraints , provided that non - linear field kinetic terms coupled to the einstein tensor do not dominate over other non - linear field self - interactions . </S>"
