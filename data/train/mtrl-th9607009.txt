    "in comparison with the widely accepted and extensively applied local density functional technique ( lda ) , the quantum monte carlo methods ( qmc ) represent rather new developments for the ground - state determination of solids . @xcite especially the variational quantum monte carlo method ( vqmc ) is attractive , because the quality of the approximation is controlled by the property of yielding an upper bound , i.e. , by the simple rule : the lower the energy the better the wave function .",
    "the statistical error of an expectation value can be safely estimated .",
    "it behaves favorably near an eigenvalue where the variance should vanish .",
    "thus this method is really _ ab initio _ , not relying on any uncontrolled quantity , such as an unknown correlation functional in the case of lda .",
    "this aspect seems to be actually important , because the detailed results of the density functional theory ( dft ) in fact depend sensitively on the choice of this functional.@xcite furthermore , in the past the role of monte carlo simulations for homogeneous systems was to determine the correlation energy to be adapted as functional for inhomogeneous lda calculations.@xcite thus today s qmc calculations on inhomogeneous systems may also be valued by the dft as it may lead to an improved functional .",
    "the first paper to apply vqmc to a solid of nonlight elements was presented by fahy , wang , and louie@xcite dealing with the ground - state determination of diamond , graphite , and silicon .",
    "they proved that such a calculation is feasible if one relies on a pseudopotential to replace the inner shells contribution .",
    "different from the low atomic number systems , @xcite an uncertainty thereby enters into this technique by the construction of the pseudopotential itself . in order to treat the system on an equal footing with lda , it is adequate to use the nonlocal _ ab initio _ potential developed by hamann.@xcite    in this paper",
    "we apply the vqmc method to the compound semiconductor gaas to calculate the ground - state properties .",
    "we closely rely on our former paper on lithium @xcite in treating the solid by simulating a finite system and in treating various other calculational details .",
    "atomic simulations are carried through to obtain the binding energy with respect to these reference values .",
    "hartree - fock calculations have been peformed to extract the correlation energy .",
    "the inner shell electrons are included within a nonlocal pseudopotential for the valence electrons .    in sec .",
    "[ method ] we briefly expose the theoretical method used by vqmc .",
    "the results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm calculates expectation values of the form @xmath0 where the integration variable @xmath1 denotes typically several hundred single variables .",
    "the error is of purely statistical nature and depends on the number of simulation points as well as on the variance and the autocorrelation function of @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum mechanical expectation value of an observable @xmath3 is calculated by setting @xmath4 the smaller the variance of @xmath5 , the smaller the statistical error of the calculation , which can be taken as a measure for the many - body wave function @xmath6 to be an eigenfunction of @xmath3 .    in the present approach we simulated @xmath7 valence electrons in a supercell containing a limited number of crystal unit cells .",
    "we sampled systems of 4 and 32 gaas unit cells to test for convergence . only the results for the large system with 256 electrons",
    "are described here . to model the solid ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed , which affect the hamiltonian and the wave function as well .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath8 consists of the kinetic energy @xmath9 , the coulomb energy @xmath10 , and the local part @xmath11 as well as the nonlocal part @xmath12 of the additional electron - ion pseudopotential , which is a generalized norm - conserving _ ab initio _ atomic pseudopotential.@xcite the coulomb energy includes the nucleon - nucleon , the electron - ion , and the electron - electron part .",
    "it is calculated by means of the ewald summation technique.@xcite the local part of the pseudopotential can be decomposed into a sum over atoms @xmath13 at site @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the position relative to @xmath14 of the @xmath17th electron of spin @xmath18 .",
    "the respective sum for the nonlocal pseudopotential contains a summation over angular momenta @xmath19 , upon which the wave function is projected : + @xmath20 the spherical angle @xmath21 is referred to the direction of @xmath22 in an arbitrary but fixed polar coordinate system .",
    "the projection operator demanding high numerical efforts needs only to be calculated where the radial pseudopotential @xmath23 is nonzero , i.e. , when @xmath16 lies within the radius of the atomic pseudopotential .",
    "the integration is done as a sum over a grid of four points on the sphere that is exact for @xmath24.@xcite    the wave function consists of a product of two slater determinants and a jastrow factor : @xmath25 the exponent of the jastrow factor is chosen in the usual form for solids : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a variational parameter . for a given @xmath27 the value of @xmath28",
    "is fixed by the cusp condition , which removes the coulomb singularity .",
    "the slater determinants @xmath29 consist of parametrized hybrid bonds in the tetrahedral directions @xmath30 from the arsenic ion @xmath31     + \\sum_i { \\tau}_i { \\phi}_{p_i}^{\\rm as }              [ ( { \\bf r}-{\\bf r}_{\\rm as})/\\zeta_{p}^{\\rm as } ]     \\text { , } \\\\    \\phi_{\\rm hyb}^{\\rm ga}({\\bf r } ) & = &        \\gamma^{\\rm ga } \\phi_{s}^{\\rm ga }          [ ( { \\bf r}-{\\bf r}_{\\rm ga})/\\zeta_{s}^{\\rm ga } ] %   \\nonumber \\\\ & &      - \\sum_i { \\tau}_i { \\phi}_{p_i}^{\\rm ga }          [ ( { \\bf r}-{\\bf r}_{\\rm ga})/\\zeta_{p}^{\\rm ga } ] \\text{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are variational parameters and @xmath17 runs over the cartesian components @xmath35 .",
    "the quantities @xmath34 describe the contraction of the wave functions as usual for atomic orbitals in solids and reduce the additional extent introduced by the jastrow factor .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath32 represent the adjustable parameters for building hybrid bonds .",
    "the wave function is automatically normalized within the qmc formalism .    for the ratios @xmath36 of the random walk and in the projection operator as well as in the parts contributing to the kinetic energy , the inverse matrices of the slater matrices",
    "are conveniently determined numerically by the sherman - morrison - woodbury formula.the periodic boundary conditions with respect to the wave functions are controlled by green s relation @xmath37 .",
    "the minimization over the huge parameter space is done as follows .",
    "several hundreds of parameter sets in the region of the guessed minimum are chosen from a multidimensional gaussian distribution .",
    "the total - energy expectation values weighted with their reciprocal statistical errors are fit into a multidimensional quadratic function .",
    "if the minimum of the fit lies within the region of the chosen statistical ensemble , a few parameter sets are selected along the minimum line of the fit with an increased number of simulation points .",
    "this calculation along the minimum line is statistically independent of the prior calculation with the large number of parameter sets and therefore not biased as it would be , if the absolute minima of several calculations were explicitly taken .",
    "at first , a minimization for the ground - state energies of the gallium and the arsenic atom has been carried through .",
    "table [ atoms ] gives an overview of the obtained quantities .",
    "the total energies are lower than the experimental values , which are the sums of the ionization potentials of the valence electrons .",
    "only the valence electrons have been simulated in this approach .",
    "the differences are supposed to indicate the error from the frozen - core approximation using pseudopotentials , also apparent in the first ionization potentials .",
    "as expected , the @xmath34 parameters all result in @xmath38 from the minimization of the hartree - fock approach . introducing the jastrow factor",
    "we observe compression of the atomic orbitals even in the free atom . to deduce the constituents of the total energy , we made a hartree - fock simulation .",
    "the first ionization potentials are obtained from the approximation that the wave function is represented by the same parametrization scheme , i.e. , by that of the neutral atom .",

    "the pseudopotentials give excellent results in this approach of parametrized linear combination of atomic orbitals wave functions even with the semilocal approximation .",
    "differences in the cohesive energy originate from underestimating the atomic total energies of as and ga owing to deficiencies of the pseudopotential in the atomic calculation .",
    "the lattice constant agrees very well with the experimental value , although this quantity statistically arises with a somewhat larger uncertainty than the total energy .",
    "the respective error given in table [ gaas ] is an upper bound estimated by just considering the fit in fig .",
    "[ etot256 ] .",
    "the bulk modulus is obtained slightly too high , which indicates that lattice constants in the far neighborhood of the minimum are treated worse in the minimization procedure than those in the close neighborhood .",
    "this may be understood by observing that the minimum line is the result of the multidimensional quadratic fit , i.e. , a straight line through the parameter space . in the far neighborhood of the global minimum",
    "this restriction could yield nonminimum parameters .",
    "the parts the total energy is composed of , as given in table [ gaas ] , are calculated in the minimum of the hartree - fock approach .",
    "the minimization was more difficult in this case , because the coulomb cusp leads to a larger variance in the total energy .",
    "the difference between the results of the hartree - fock ansatz and the jastrow - slater ansatz , which defines the correlation energy , shows no statistically significant behavior in the simulated range of the lattice constant .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath42  ev per unit cell does not vary much near the ground - state density .",
    "the statistical data set for the correlation yields a straight regression line , the energy increasing with decreasing electron density with a slope of @xmath43  ev per @xmath44 .",
    "a measure for the ionicity is obtained by counting the electron visits to specific voronoi polyhedra during a run .",
    "the polyhedra are constructed according to a partition of the crystal in which lattice sites are added at the empty tetrahedral positions and at the cube center , the so - called empty spheres positions in zinc - blende muffin - tin calculations . as a result",
    "the occupied as , occupied ga , unoccupied as , and unoccupied ga sites show charges of 3.9 , 2.2 , 0.9 , and 1.0 electrons , respectively .",
    "thus , both ions are positively charged the separated electrons extending into the interstitial space .",
    "the covalent bond charge was estimated by placing the centers of voronoi polyhedra upon the bonds of the above lattice so that the polyhedra cover the bond region between sites that are occupied or empty .",
    "a slight charge accumulation appears on the occupied ga - as bond of 0.13 electron per bond in addition to the charge which arises by the spherically symmetric electron distribution of the neutral atoms .    summarizing the obtained results ,",
    "the good agreement with experiment puts the variational quantum monte carlo method into competition with current density functional techniques as far as the absolute ground - state quantities , calculated here , are concerned .",
    "the minimum principle guarantees an additional reliability absent in dft , which in contrast bears an uncertainty because of the , in some respects , arbitrary choice of the density functional .",
    "as the latter is able to treat more complicated solids , the comparison with qmc calculations on the basis of simple systems may lead to a selection and adjustment of suitable functionals .",
