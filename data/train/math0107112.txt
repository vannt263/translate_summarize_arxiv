    "the starting point for this investigation was the wish to develop a representation theory for the star product algebras as they arise in deformation quantization @xcite , see @xcite for recent reviews as well as daniel sternheimer s contribution in this proceedings .",
    "in deformation quantization the main emphasis lies on the construction of the _ observable algebra _ out of the classical data .",
    "the observables are understood to be the _ primary object _ as opposed to other quantization schemes based on particular operator representations on hilbert spaces .",
    "more specifically , one deforms the classical poisson algebra of observables , modeled by smooth complex - valued functions @xmath2 on a classical phase space @xmath3 , into the direction of the poisson bracket determined by the symplectic or poisson structure of @xmath3 .",
    "this new non - commutative product is understood to be the multiplication law for the quantum observables .",
    "usually , formal associative deformations in the sense of gerstenhaber @xcite are considered , yielding the notion of ( formal ) _",
    "star products_. the @xmath1-involution of star products as well as the order structure of real formal power series allow for an _ intrinsic _ definition of _ states _ as positive linear functionals of the observable algebra .",
    "it turns out that many of the well - known ` quantizations ' can be recovered as gns representations induced by certain particular states @xcite .",
    "the reader will certainly notice that this line of arguments reminds very much the haag - kastler formulation of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the motivation and conceptual advantages for such an approach to quantization : first the states are known automatically ( and even in some functorial way ) once the observable algebra is known . secondly , and",
    "even more important , one can consider _ different _ representations of one observable algebra .",
    "this corresponds to the same system in _ different _ physical situations .",
    "here one has various examples like thermodynamical equilibrium at different temperatures , modeled e.g.   by kms states @xcite in order to study phase transitions , as well as super selection rules and topological effects like the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "a further example is the re - interpretation of dirac s quantization condition for magnetic charges of magnetic monopoles as a condition for morita equivalence of the quantization with and without magnetic field . in particular , the whole categories of @xmath1-representations are equivalent when dirac s condition is fulfilled @xcite .",
    "these examples show the need for a good understanding of what the representation theory of deformation quantization looks like .",
    "thus we shall give here an overview over the recent developments and discuss various examples .",
    "we shall focus on the ideas and motivations rather than on the detailed proofs as they can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we also give a quite extensive ( though certainly incomplete ) guide to the literature .",

    "hence @xmath421 and @xmath422 if classically @xmath321 . moreover , in this case @xmath423 will do the job , i.e.   @xmath424 gives a simple description of the @xmath301-right linear endomorphisms and we have @xmath425 surprisingly , in this case the center @xmath2 of the undeformed algebra @xmath281 is still a _ sub - algebra _ with respect to @xmath15",

    "there is a simple ech cohomological construction of @xmath433 .",
    "we again use the good cover as before . then on @xmath315 the star products @xmath15 and @xmath5 are equivalent via some @xmath434 , i.e.@xmath435 , since @xmath315 is contractible . on overlaps it follows that @xmath436 is a @xmath5-automorphism starting with the identity .",
    "hence it is an inner automorphism @xmath437 } ( f )      = { \\operatorname{\\mathrm exp}}(t_{\\alpha\\beta } ) \\star f \\star { \\operatorname{\\mathrm exp}}(-t_{\\alpha\\beta})\\ ] ] with some function @xmath438 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath439 denotes the @xmath5-exponential , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath440 satisfy the ` cocycle condition ' @xmath441 whence @xmath442 has to be a central element and thus _ constant _ on the triple overlap . since for the star exponential one has a bch formula denoted by @xmath443",
    "we find that @xmath444\\ ] ] has to be _ constant _ on @xmath445 as well .",

    "now let us turn to ( strong ) morita equivalence of star products .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath15 are morita equivalent by some equivalence bimodule , then it has to be a finitely generated and projective @xmath5-right module .",

    "moreover , we can choose within the _ isomorphism _ class of @xmath15 a representative such that we have a bimodule deformation .",
    "this corresponds to the distinguished _ equivalence _ class as discussed in theorem  [ theorem : defprojmod ] .",
    "the subtle point here is the fact that an isomorphism of star products starts in zeroth order with the pull - back by some diffeomorphism which is not local . at the moment",
    "we want to exclude this non - locality and consider this additional freedom later . for such @xmath15 we know from section  [ sec : ltog ] that we can find _ local _ operators @xmath454 \\to      c^\\infty(\\mathcal{o}_\\alpha)[[\\lambda]]\\ ] ] such that @xmath455 is the local matrix of a global @xmath301-right linear endomorphism @xmath456 of the deformed line bundle .",

    "on the other hand , from we know @xmath458 up to now we have not yet used that @xmath5 was a symplectic star product .",
    "thus we have the following statement , which is non - trivial in the poisson case :    [ lemma : localequiv ] let @xmath5 and @xmath15 be morita equivalent star products on a poisson manifold with a deformed equivalence bimodule",
    ". then @xmath5 and @xmath15 are locally equivalent .",
    "in particular , they deform the same poisson bracket , see also ( * ? ? ? *",
    "3.4 )    since @xmath456 is a global @xmath301-right linear endomorphism we conclude with that @xmath459 since in zeroth order @xmath344 is just @xmath345 we can write them as star exponentials @xmath460 with some @xmath461 , where @xmath462 . thus in the symplectic case the relative class of @xmath15 and @xmath5 is given by the class @xmath463 $ ] coming form these @xmath464 as in . on the other hand ,",
    "this class can be computed explicitly .",

    "but this shows that it coincides with its classical limit which is given by @xmath467 . since the @xmath468 where just the logarithms of the transitions functions @xmath345 of the undeformed line bundle we conclude that @xmath469 yields the _ chern class _ of @xmath470 . on the other hand , if @xmath433 is a _ @xmath471-integral class _ then there exists a line bundle with fiber metric which we can deform",
    ". then theorem  [ theorem : defprojmod ] together with lemma  [ lemma : deffull ] and theorem  [ theorem : strongylfull ] shows that @xmath5 and @xmath15 are strongly morita equivalent in this case .",
    "thus we have the following characterization ( * ? ? ?",

    "two star products @xmath5 and @xmath473 are strongly morita equivalent if and only if there exists a diffeomorphic star product @xmath15 to @xmath473 such that @xmath474      there exists also a characterization of morita equivalent star products in the poisson case . if one formally ` inverts ' the condition @xmath476 one obtains a geometric series for the relation between the corresponding poisson structures @xmath118 and @xmath477 . here",
    "one has to observe that @xmath430 starts in order @xmath478 with the symplectic form @xmath104 .",
    "thus one obtains a relation between the formal deformations of the original poisson bracket in kontsevich s sense @xcite , which are known to classify star products in the poisson case .",
    "that this heuristic reasoning is actually correct is a result of juro , schupp , and wess @xcite .    in the above construction",
    "the inner products only played a minor role .",
    "indeed , we can also consider the morita equivalence of star products from a purely ring - theoretical point of view .",
    "it turns out that for hermitian star products this notion of morita equivalence _ coincides _ with the strong morita equivalence as @xmath1-algebras over @xmath6 $ ] , see also the discussion in @xcite .",
    "we have emphasized here the aspect of strong morita equivalence since this implies the equivalence of the categories of @xmath1-representations on pre - hilbert spaces , which from a physical point of view is the most interesting consequence of morita equivalence .",
    "nevertheless , there are also several other consequences .",
    "recall that the _ picard group _ @xmath479 of an algebra is the group of equivalence classes of self - morita equivalences . in the classical case",

    "one knows that the picard group @xmath479 acts canonically on the moduli space of equivalence classes of deformations of @xmath82 .",
    "thus theorem  [ theorem : mestars ] can also be understood as an explicit computation of this group action : for the star products on a symplectic manifold the picard group acts on the equivalence classes just by adding the @xmath481-multiple of the chern class of the corresponding line bundle in the zeroth order of @xmath48 to the characteristic class .",

    "we can also compute the picard group of @xmath5 , since in this case the additional diffeomorphism in does not spoil the argument .      1",

    "2 .   @xmath486 admits a @xmath5-bimodule structure deforming the classical one if and only if @xmath470 is flat , i.e.   @xmath487 .    [",
    "remark : dirac ] a very explicit physical interpretation of the above characterization of morita equivalent star products can be achieved in the case of star products on cotangent bundles @xmath488 .",
    "here one explicitly knows various star products , in particular a star product @xmath489 as quantization of a charged particle in presence of a magnetic field @xmath490 on the configuration space @xmath491 . as usual @xmath490",
