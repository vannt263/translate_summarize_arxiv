    "the french electricity company , lectricit de france ( edf ) , uses extensively the customer class load profiles in distribution network calculation .",
    "load profiles are also used to predict future loads in distribution network planning or to estimate the daily load curve of a new customer .",
    "the customer data usually includes information about the type of the electricity connection , the customer class , the consumption type and some other additional information .",
    "the combination of the individual customer informations and the class load profiles allows us to estimate its load curve .    at edf",
    ", the mean profile is used as an indicator of the electricity consumption of the customers .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that the mean is highly sensitive to the presence of outliers , for instance consumers with high level of consumption . as small ( 1990 ) states ,  it suffices to have only one customer contaminating a data set and going off to infinity to send the mean curve to infinity as well .",
    "by contrast , at least 50% of the data must be moved to infinity to force the median curve to do the same  .",
    "more precisely , the median is robust to punctually extreme electricity consumptions of some customers and from a practical point of view , this can help to manage the electricity supply .",
    "moreover , in the context of the electricity open market , new customers join the edf company while other ones leave it and it is important to know the amount of electricity demand . since the load profiles are not known for new customers , it is more difficult to predict their impact on the global electricity demand",
    ". based on individual customer information , new customers will belong to a specific class and will be allowed the synthetic profile that describes the consumption behavior of its class . in these situations ,",
    "robust profiles should be used and this is why , we suggest using the median profile besides the mean curve as a robust indicator for analyzing the population of electricity load curves . the median of a sample of univariate observations is a natural and useful characteristic of central position .",
    "multivariate data , on the other hand , have no natural ordering .",
    "there are several ways to generalize the univariate median to multivariate data and they all have their advantages and disadvantages ( see small , 1990 for a survey of multidimentional medians ) .",
    "first uses of the multivariate median were limited to two - dimentional vectors and were motivated mainly by problems of quantitative geography ( namely , of centro - graphical analysis ) which were dealt with by the u.s.a .",
    "bureau of census in the late 19th and early 20th century .",
    "we focus here on the @xmath0-median , also called the geometric or spatial median",
    ". early work on the spatial median is due to hayford ( 1902 ) and gini & galvani ( 1929 ) among others .",
    "its definition is a direct generalization of the real median proposed by haldane ( 1948 ) and properties of the spatial median have been studied in details by kemperman ( 1987 ) .",
    "iterative estimation algorithms have been developed by gower ( 1974 ) and vardi and zhang ( 2000 ) .    in the next few years",
    ", the french company edf intends to install over 30 millions electricity smart meters , in each firm and household .",
    "a meter is an electronic device constructed for measuring the electricity consumption .",
    "these meters will be able to send individual electricity consumption measures on very fine time scales .",
    "the new smart electricity meters will provide accurate and up - to - date electricity consumption data that can be used to model distribution network loads . in view of this new setting",
    ", the interest variables such as the consumption curve for example , may be considered as realizations of functional variables depending on a continuous time index @xmath1 that belongs to @xmath2 $ ] rather than multivariate vectors .",
    "kemperman ( 1987 ) , cadre ( 2001 ) and gervini ( 2008 ) studied the properties of the median with functional data .",
    "we cite also the very recent work of cardot _",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "another important issue is data storage .",
    "the amount of load data will be enormous when all or almost all of the customers have smart meters .",
    "collecting , saving and analyzing all this information , would be very expensive .",
    "for example , if measures are taken every 10 minutes during one year and if we are interested in estimating the total electricity consumption for residential customers , the data storage is of about 100 terabytes .",
    "we suggest using survey sampling techniques in order to get estimates of the median profile that are as accurate as possible at reasonable cost .",
    "the reader is referred to fuller ( 2009 ) for a very recent monograph on survey sampling theory .",
    "nevertheless , the idea of selecting randomly a sample from a population of curves is rather new .",
    "chiky & hbrail ( 2008 ) compare two approaches for estimating the mean curve .",
    "the first one consists in using signal compression methods for the whole population of curves and the second approach suggests taking a simple random sampling of the actual curves .",
    "their conclusion is that the results are better in the latter situation even with rather simple sampling designs .",
    "very recently , cardot _ et al . _",
    "( 2010 ) developed the estimation of functional principal component analysis with survey data and cardot and josserand ( 2011 ) studied the properties of the mean curve estimator with stratified sampling .",
    "we cite also chaouch and goga ( 2010 ) who treated the estimation of geometric quantiles , the generalization of the spatial median , with survey data .",
    "as far as we know nothing has been done in the estimation of the @xmath0-median in a functional framework with survey data whereas it might have great practical interest .",
    "this is why , we investigate in this paper the median curve estimator when several sampling designs and estimators are used .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the results presented in this paper may be applied for other functional data which are not necessarily related to time as it was the case of the electricity data . nowadays , functional data may arise in various other domains such as chemometrics or remote sensing and then the functional response variables depend on index @xmath1 that may be a frequency and not necessary a time index .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section 2 gives the main results concerning the median curve estimation with survey data .",
    "a weighted estimator for the median curve is suggested and its asymptotic variance function is exhibited by means of the linearization technique developed by deville ( 1999 ) .",
    "a variance estimator is also proposed .",
    "section 3 gives the estimation of the median curve and of its variance function for a firm population of @xmath3 load electricity curves .",
    "we consider several sampling designs : the simple random sampling without replacement , the systematic sampling , the stratified sampling with optimal and proportional allocation , and the with replacement proportional - to - size design . in the case of the stratified sampling ,",
    "we suggest using the k - means algorithm to construct homogeneous strata with respect to the linearized variables .",
    "we illustrate through simulations that a substantial reduction compared to simple random sampling is obtained .",
    "we adapt to the functional framework the selection of a sample when auxiliary information is used at the sampling stage as for the with replacement proportional - to - size design .",
    "finally , we improve the horvitz - thompson estimator of the functional median by considering the poststratified estimator .",

    "weber ( 1909 ) considered @xmath23 as a solution to a problem in a _ location theory _ in which the @xmath15 are the planar coordinates of @xmath5 customers , who are served by a company that wants to find an optimal location for its warehouse .",
    "it is also known as the fermat - weber point .",
    "a geometrical interpretation of the median defined by ( [ medu ] ) is that the centroid of the vectors @xmath25 is the origin in @xmath26 with only three points and bidimensional data , the median @xmath23 is known to be the steiner point of the triangle @xmath27 the spatial median has also origins in the early work during the twelve census in the united sates in 1900 concerned by finding the geographical center of the population over time .",
    "hayford ( 1902 ) proposed the point - wise median as the geographical center but explicitly noted the drawback of the fact that the point - wise median depends on the choice of the orthogonal coordinates and it is not equivariant under orthogonal transformations .",
    "brown ( 1983 ) goes further with this idea and states that when dealing with spatial data where variables possess isometry and require statistical techniques that have rotational invariance , it is more appropriate to use a median that shares these properties .",
    "we recall that with observations @xmath15 that lie in @xmath28 the point - wise median is the @xmath29-dimensional vector of medians computed from the univariate components and for functional variables , the empirical point - wise median is obtained if the @xmath30 norm is used in ( [ defm ] ) instead of the @xmath31 norm , @xmath32.\\ ] ]    to illustrate the mean curve and the point - wise median versus the spatial median , we plot in figure  [ meanmed ] the three curves for the test population of @xmath3 companies considered in section [ applicationedf ] . the electricity consumption is measured every 30 minutes .",
    "chaudhuri ( 1996 ) shows that the geometric quantiles defined in formula ( [ defmedgeom ] ) from below and which are a generalization of the median defined by ( [ defm ] ) are equivariant under orthogonal transformations unlike the point - wise median .",
    "moreover , chaudhuri showed also that the spatial or the @xmath0 median is equivariant under any homogeneous scale transformation of the coordinates of the multivariate observations which is appropriate when one needs to standardize the coordinate variables appropriately before computing the median . the main arguments that play in favor of the spatial median are the _ uniqueness _ ( see e.g. chaudhuri , 1996 for the @xmath29-dimensional case with @xmath33 and kemperman , 1987 for the functional case ) and the fact that it is _ a global and central indicator _ of the distribution of the data .",
    "more exactly , the spatial median takes into account all instants making the spatial median a central indicator of the distribution of the data while the point - wise median is a central indicator but only for each instant .",
    "consider for example that we have consumption electricity data recorded during two weeks : one working week and one holiday week such as the christmas week .",
    "we compute first the spatial , respectively the point - wise median , by considering only the working week time measurements .",
    "next , we consider the two week consumption electricity and we compute again the spatial , respectively the point - wise median .",
    "it can be noticed that the coordinates of the point - wise median that correspond to the working week are the same in both situations while they are changed for the spatial median . since is due to the fact that the spatial median is computed by taking into account all the time measurements while the point - wise median is computed instant by instant .",
    "moreover , brown ( 1983 ) shows that there is an asymptotic efficiency from using the spatial median instead of the point - wise median .",
    "in fact , one can see that the objective function is differentiable in the case of the spatial median while this property is not fulfilled for the point - wise median .    as noted by serfling ( 2002 )",
    ", the median defined by ( [ medu ] ) and @xmath22 has a nice robustness property in the sense that @xmath23 depends only on its direction towards @xmath34 more exactly , @xmath23 remains unchanged if the @xmath35 are moved outward along these rays while it is obvious that the point - wise median will change .    * remark * : chaudhuri ( 1996 ) extends the definition ( [ defm ] ) to geometric quantiles by using the geometry of data clouds . in a functional setting , its definition indexes the quantiles by the elements @xmath36 $ ] with @xmath37 @xmath38 } \\sum",

    "this is why , our discussion is limited to the case @xmath41      algorithms have been proposed to solve the equation ( [ medu ] ) ( vardi and zhang , 2000 , gervini , 2008 ) but they need important computational efforts especially when the number of time measurements is large . in this work ,",
    "we suggest estimating the median curve @xmath23 by taking only a sample @xmath42 from @xmath43 according to a sampling design .",

    "it is worth mentioning that improving the estimation of the median curve means constructing strata homogeneous with respect to the linearized variables , @xmath140 indeed , relation ( [ variancelin ] ) gives us that the asymptotic variance function of @xmath85 with strat is @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the population variance within stratum @xmath187 of @xmath194 that is , the lower the variation of the linearized variable within stratum , the lower the asymptotic variance of @xmath195 the variance estimator is the sum of variance estimators ( [ estimvarsrs ] ) computed within each stratum .",
    "+ usually , one builds the stratification using a variable known on the whole population and strongly correlated with the variable of interest . in our case",
    ", we suggest two stratification variables computed using the first week : the first one is the linearized variable @xmath141 and the second one is the consumption @xmath60 ( cardot and josserand , 2011 ) .",
    "the following two sample allocations are used : * the proportional allocation ( prop ) : @xmath196 for all @xmath197 * the @xmath198-optimal allocation ( @xmath199-optim ) as suggested by cardot and josserand ( 2011 ) and computed here with respect to the variance @xmath200 of the linearized variable computed during the first week and denoted by @xmath201 @xmath202 + the @xmath198-optimal allocation is similar to the neyman optimal allocation but computed using @xmath198 instead of @xmath203 the @xmath204-optimal allocation is obtained when the consumption during the first week @xmath167 is used .",
    "+ _ stratification based on the linearized variable during the first week _ + the proposed strategy can be split into two steps : + * step 1 : * we calculate the linearized variables @xmath205 for all @xmath61 during the first week . + * step 2 : * we stratify the population @xmath43 using the k - means clustering algorithm with the euclidean distance and applied to the linearized variables @xmath206 for @xmath207 according to within cluster variance considerations , we decide to keep @xmath208 different clusters .",
    "the strata sizes as well as both the proportional and @xmath198-optimal allocation are given in table[t1 ] .",

    "the stratified sampling with optimal allocation gives more accurate estimation of @xmath210 than the other strategies .",
    "we can observe that clustering the space of functions by performing stratified sampling may leads to a considerable gain in terms of accuracy of the estimators of the variance function , dividing by ten the mean error compared to simple random sampling without replacement .",
    "moreover , there is also a difference between proportional and optimal allocations rules , for example the third quartile in optimal case is lower than the median loss in the proportional case .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a survey sampling approach for estimating the median of a functional variable . from a practical point of view ,",
    "an appealing consequence of the new methodology is that the proposed estimators are faster to calculate .",
    "the experimental results on a test population of electricity consumption curves confirm that even with high dimensional data , stratification associated with the optimal allocation rule leads to important reduction of the variance estimators .",
    "having appropriate strata is the key for getting more accurate estimators and the k - means algorithm is well adapted in this situation .",
    "nevertheless , choosing the stratification variables is a rather complex issue and more work is needed in this direction .    a challenging future research avenue concerns the use of auxiliary information at the estimation stage .",
    "while , in this paper , we have concentrated on the estimation of the median using the horvitz - thompson estimator or the poststratified estimator , more complex estimators using functional regression models can be developed .",
    "for example , it is possible to set a linear functional model which explains the functional variable @xmath60 using a scalar @xmath167 and to develop a regression estimator for the median curve . developing a general framework for regression estimators for the median curve",
