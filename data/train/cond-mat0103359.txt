    "in the past decade , the formation of rough surfaces under far - from - equilibrium conditions was a central theme in statistical physics .",
    "the application of self - affine fractals and scaling methods was essential to the progress that has been made towards the understanding of these non - equilibrium phenomena . within this context",
    ", the standard tools used to describe various self - affine structures observed in disordered surface growth are the roughness @xmath4 and the growth @xmath8 exponents  @xcite .",
    "the central goal of this approach is provide information about the correlations between fluctuations of a space and/or time varying property .",
    "theoretical modeling of self - affine growth processes frequently used some of the models investigated in critical phenomena , e.g. , directed percolation , random field ising  @xcite and sine - gordon models  @xcite .",
    "these efforts faced an old problem : thirty years after the renormalization group theory of critical phenomena , the quantitatively accurate prediction of the location and characteristics of phase transitions still constitute a challenging and controversial question  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true when one considers systems with random quenched disorder ( e.g. , random field ising and potts models , spin glasses and structural glasses  @xcite ) , which exhibit non - trivial features such as extremely slow dynamics , aging , ergodicity breaking , complex energy landscapes , etc .    on the other hand , the inverse problem , i.e. , using the roughness exponents to study",
    "the main features of the phase diagram of equilibrium spin models , has not been much explored up to now . in 1997 ,",
    "de sales _ et al . _",
    "@xcite mapped cellular automata ( ca ) configurations on solid - on - solid like profiles and used the roughness exponent @xmath4 to classify the elementary wolfram ca rules .",
    "later , they also shown that this exponent can be used to detect the frozen - active transition in the one dimensional domany - kinzel ca ( dkca )  @xcite without any reference to order parameters or response functions . as we mentioned before , beyond the roughness exponent @xmath4 , the growth exponent @xmath8 is another critical index used to describe roughening processes in the surface growth context .",
    "recently , atman and moreira  @xcite determined the exponent @xmath8 for the growth process generated by the spatiotemporal patterns of the dkca .",
    "the value of @xmath8 exhibits a cusp at the frozen - active frontier and , if one observes the difference configuration between two dkca replicas , also at the active - chaotic critical frontier .",
    "the advantage of this method to find the phase diagram of the dkca is that it is not necessary to wait for the system `` thermalizes '' , a process which often dispends a lot of computational time .    in this paper",
    "we extended the roughness exponent analysis to other standard models of statistical mechanics .",
    "specifically , we study the @xmath0-state potts model ( with @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , the simplest locally interacting statistical model exhibiting both first and second order static phase transitions .",
    "we study also the @xmath3 clock model for which a kosterlitz - thouless type phase transition is observed . finally , since any connectivity problem can be studied by starting with pure random percolation and then adding interactions , we apply the roughness method to random - site percolation .    in section 2",
    "we describe the models and define the mapping between spin configurations and walk profiles . in section 3 , using the mapping between spin states and profiles , we characterize the phases of the random - site percolation problem , potts and clock models by the roughness exponent @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we conclude and indicate future directions of this work in section 4 .",
    "the @xmath0-state potts ferromagnet consists of spin variables @xmath9 which may take on @xmath0 discrete values @xmath10 and are coupled by the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "the @xmath13-state clock model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath14 in which each spin can assume @xmath13 discrete values @xmath15 .    in eqs .",
    "( [ potts ] ) and ( [ clock ] ) the sums in @xmath16 runs over the lattice sites and their nearest - neighbors , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the temperature , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the coupling constant .",
    "we simulated the potts model with @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the clock model with @xmath3 states , on square lattices of @xmath21 sites imposing periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for updating the spins we use a sequential monte carlo heat - bath process .    in random - site percolation ,",
    "one randomly occupies a fraction @xmath13 of the sites of a @xmath22-dimensional lattice ( @xmath23 : empty site ; @xmath24 : occupied site ) .",
    "when @xmath13 is small , the pair connectedness length scale @xmath25 is short , comparable to the lattice constant @xmath26 .",
    "however , when @xmath13 approaches @xmath27 , there occur fluctuations in the characteristic size of clusters on all scales from @xmath26 to @xmath25 , which diverges as @xmath28 .",
    "each feature of thermal critical phenomena has a corresponding analog in percolation , so that the percolation problem is called a geometric or connectivity critical phenomena . for site percolation on the square lattice",
    "the critical probability is @xmath29  @xcite .    in the present work we mainly focused on the numerical study of the self - affine profiles generated from the configurations in the ordered and disordered phases of the potts and clock models and in the site - percolation problem .",
    "as shown in a previous work   @xcite the spin states can be mapped on random walk - like profiles and the correlations present in them can be measured using the roughness exponent .",
    "the simplest method to generate walk profiles from the spin configurations at a time @xmath30 is a 1:1 mapping in which each spin state @xmath31 is associated to a step ( to the right or to the left ) of a one - dimensional walk .",
    "specifically , to an unique spin configuration @xmath32 corresponds a spatial profile @xmath33 , given by the sequence of the walker displacements @xmath34 after @xmath35 unit steps defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 potts models , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) if @xmath42 ( if @xmath43 ) for the @xmath3 clock model , and @xmath44 for the ising ( @xmath45 ) model and site - percolation .    after obtained the profiles by this mappings , the roughness exponent @xmath4 was calculated by determining the average standard deviation of parts of the profiles with various scales @xmath46 . at site @xmath35 , in the scale @xmath46",
    ", the rms displacement fluctuation is given by : @xmath47 with @xmath48 the roughness in the scale @xmath46 is given by @xmath49    the roughness @xmath50 can distinguish two possible types of profiles .",
    "if it is random or even exhibits a finite correlation length extending up to a characteristic range ( such as in a markov chain ) , then @xmath51 as in a normal random walk .",
    "in contrast , if the profile has infinitely long - range correlations ( no characteristic length ) , then its roughness will be described by a power law scaling such as @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the case @xmath54 implies that the profile presents persistent correlations , i.e. , a given displacement sequence ( increasing or decreasing ) is likely to be close to another of the same type . on the other hand ,",
    "profiles with @xmath55 are anticorrelated , which means that displacement sequences containing a great fraction of steps to the right are more likely to alternate with another one in which steps to the left are predominant and vice versa .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 is restricted to the interval @xmath56 $ ] and is related to the fractal dimension @xmath22 of the profile by @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "before discuss the results , we shall make a very brief review of the equilibrium phase diagrams of the @xmath0-state potts and @xmath3 clock models . the square lattice @xmath0-state potts ferromagnet presents a second order phase transition for @xmath58 and a first order one for @xmath59 at the critical temperatures @xmath60 ( in units of @xmath61 ) .",
    "the @xmath13-state clock model interpolates between the ising ( @xmath62 ) and the xy ( @xmath63 ) models . for @xmath64",
    "one expects the emergence of a soft spin - wave phase between the ordered , low temperature , and the disordered , high temperature phases  @xcite . for the @xmath3 case ,",
    "the spin - wave phase is limited by the transition temperatures @xmath65 and @xmath66  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we show typical walk profiles generated by spin configurations of the ising model ( @xmath45 ) . from data similar to those in fig . 1 for different temperatures",
    ", we obtained the behavior of the roughness exponents @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "2 , for the ising model with @xmath67 and 128 .",
    "these results correspond to averages over typically @xmath68 random initial configurations taken after thermalization .",
    "the roughness exponent exhibits an abrupt fall from @xmath69 to @xmath6 at the temperature @xmath70 which agrees with the static critical value @xmath71 as we increase the system size we can note that the change of @xmath4 at @xmath72 becomes sharper , suggesting a step function for the @xmath73 curve at the thermodynamical limit , and a high - temperature value of the exponent @xmath4 tending to @xmath74 . indeed , the inset in fig .",
    "2 shows that the width @xmath75 goes to zero as @xmath76 increases , where @xmath77 is arbitrarily defined as the difference between the observed upper temperature @xmath78 for which @xmath79 and the temperature @xmath80 for which @xmath4 has fallen to half its maximum ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we also observe that , in this same limit , the temperature @xmath78 tends to the exact critical temperature @xmath82 ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we show similar behaviors for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 potts model with @xmath86 .",
    "the abrupt falls in the exponent @xmath4 are located at the temperatures @xmath87 and @xmath88 which are also in good agreement with the static critical values @xmath89 and @xmath90 the values @xmath5 observed in the low temperature phases correspond to flat profiles reflecting the existence of long - range order ( magnetization ) . in contrast , the values @xmath6 obtained in the high temperature phases characterize random walk profiles , as expected for disordered spin configurations .",
    "finally , any qualitative difference is observed among the @xmath73 curves across the critical surfaces corresponding to second ( @xmath38 ) or first ( @xmath39 ) order phase transitions .    in fig .",
    "4 we show a typical log - log plot of @xmath91 for the ising model , whose fitted slopes give the roughness exponent values .",
    "we observe , in general , the existence of two distinct linear portions in the curve , whose intersection point defines a particular length scale @xmath92 .",
    "the value of @xmath93 seems to be a measure of the average size of the spin islands or magnetized micro - domains limited by the correlation length @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , at the ferromagnetic phase , for small scales ( @xmath95 ) there is resolution to see the local spin fluctuations around the smooth profile , which leads to @xmath96 . for large scales ( @xmath97 ) the profile is flat and the values @xmath5 reflect the long - range order . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath93 rapidly decreases to the lattice constant @xmath98 , which agrees with the fact that such crossover is not observed in a random profile .",
    "an additional support to the relationship between @xmath92 and @xmath99 is provided by fig . 5 which shows that @xmath93 ( for the ising model ) has a peak near the temperature @xmath72 . the height and sharpness of this peak increase with the system size .",
    "a finite size analysis for the ising model shows that the maximum value of the crossover length @xmath93 ( which occurs near the critical point ) scales linearly with the system size @xmath100 , similarly to the correlation length @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "5 suggests that @xmath93 diverges at @xmath101 as @xmath102 for the ising model .",
    "moreover , the behavior of @xmath92 near @xmath82 is similar to the @xmath103 ising model correlation length , whose exact expression @xmath104 is known for @xmath105 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . here , the dual inverse temperature @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 .",
    "a recent work by kantelhardt et al .",
    "@xcite provides the strongest support to the close relation between the length scales @xmath92 and @xmath99 that we suggest here based on our limited numerical evidence .",
    "these authors demonstrated that the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , which we used here in zero - order , can detect crossovers in the observed long - range correlation behavior of data series .",
    "they analyzed artificial data with a crossover from long - range correlations ( @xmath108 ) for @xmath109 to uncorrelated behavior for @xmath110 or vice - versa .",
    "their dfa results clearly revealed the crossover and provided estimated crossover lengths @xmath111 always larger than the real @xmath112 by a systematic deviation which increases with the detrending order @xmath113 . also , the estimated @xmath111 were less accurate for @xmath4 close to @xmath114 .",
    "the support for our suggestion comes from the analogy between the artificial series generated by fourier transforms studied in @xcite and our data series build from spin configurations in which only thermal correlations , extending up to the scale @xmath99 ( the correlation length ) , are present .",
    "the existence of two distinct linear portions in the plots of @xmath91 is also observed in the potts model . in fig .",
    "6 it is shown the behavior of @xmath93 as function of temperature for the potts model with @xmath38 and 7 . we can note the sharp peaks around the temperatures @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    in fig .",
    "7 we show typical walk profiles generated by spin configurations of the @xmath3 clock model at three temperatures : @xmath117 , located in the ordered phase , @xmath118 , in the spin - wave phase and @xmath119 in the disordered one . the roughness exponent @xmath4 as a function of the temperature for the @xmath3 clock model is shown in fig .",
    "it suggests the existence of three distinct phases , namely , a low temperature flat ( @xmath5 ) phase with long - range order and extending up to @xmath120 , a high temperature , disordered and rough ( @xmath6 ) phase for @xmath121 , and an intermediate , rough ( @xmath122 ) phase on the temperature range @xmath123 .",
    "these transition temperatures are in good agreement with those obtained for the static transitions between the ferromagnetic , paramagnetic and soft spin - wave phases of this model @xcite . the behavior of @xmath92 as a function of temperature is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath124 exhibits a sharp peak around @xmath125 , the critical temperature separating the paramagnetic and the spin - wave phases , as well as a sudden jump near @xmath126 , where the transition between the ferromagnetic and spin - wave phase occurs .",
    "but , the main feature of fig .",
    "9 is that , in the spin - wave phase ( @xmath123 ) , @xmath92 has a high and almost constant value as expected for a kosterlitz - thouless `` critical '' phase characterized by an infinite correlation length @xmath99 at all those temperatures @xcite .    finally , the roughness exponent method applied to the random site - percolation problem results in a constant value @xmath127 for the roughness exponent over the entire range of the probability @xmath13 .",
    "this result is expected since in site - percolation a fraction @xmath13 of the lattice sites is randomly occupied , generating random profiles in both phases .",
    "in addition , it is not observed a length scale @xmath92 in the log - log plots of @xmath128 , as occurred in the magnetic models .",
    "in this study we have shown that spin configurations for the potts ( with @xmath1 and 7 states ) and @xmath3 clock models exhibit distinct self - affine characteristics , measured by the roughness exponent @xmath4 .",
    "the low temperature phases of the potts model correspond to flat ( @xmath5 ) profiles , whereas the high temperature phases are associated to rough ( @xmath6 ) ones . for the @xmath3 clock model , in addition to the flat ( ferromagnetic ) and rough ( paramagnetic ) profiles , an intermediate rough ( @xmath7 ) phase , associated to a soft spin - wave one , is found .",
    "the transition temperatures between the different roughness regimes are in good agreement with the static critical temperatures of these models .",
    "our results show that the roughness exponent method is able to detect equilibrium phase transitions and provides accurate numerical determination of the critical surfaces without any reference to thermodynamical potentials , order parameters or response functions .",
    "in contrast , the roughness exponent method applied to the random site - percolation problem results in a constant value @xmath127 over the entire range of the probability @xmath13 , showing that the roughness exponent @xmath4 is insensitive to detect geometric critical phenomena .",
    "the same analysis can be applied to damage - spreading phase transitions by focusing on the difference configurations between two replicas of the system , as done by atman and moreira  @xcite . moreover , using the growth exponent @xmath8 , we can determine the phase diagram of spin models without any thermalization , leading to an impressive gain in simulations speed .",
    "we are extending our simulations in order to reliably estimate the value of the exponent @xmath129 and compare this value with the known critical exponents @xmath130 for the ising model .",
    "we conjecture that the exponent @xmath129 controlling the divergence of @xmath93 is the same as the correlation length exponent @xmath130 for this model .",
    "another problem we can address using this roughness method is the location of phase transitions in disordered models such as random field and ising spin glass models . for spin glasses , exchange ( parallel tempering )",
    "techniques greatly improve traditional monte carlo algorithms , but the sizes and temperatures accessible to simulations are still insufficient to clearly solve several important questions  @xcite . in particular",
    "the value of the critical temperature for the @xmath131 edwards - anderson model is controversial .",
    "apart from the application of the roughness method to spin models , a central issue is the nature of the relationship between the correlations measured on the spin - state profiles by the @xmath4 or @xmath8 exponents and the traditional two - point correlation functions @xmath132 .",
    "we intend to examine this question more carefully in a future work .",
