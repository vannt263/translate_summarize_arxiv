    ", a different approach based on the lubrication approximation and thin film equations was developed by benilov & vynnycky @xcite .    as a particularly simple model for the flow shown on figure [ fig-1 ] , the authors of @xcite derived the linear advection  diffusion equation for the free boundary @xmath1 of the flow : @xmath2 the contact line is fixed at @xmath3 in the reference frame moving with the velocity @xmath4 and",
    "is defined by the boundary conditions @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the flux conservation condition is expressed by the boundary condition @xmath7 ( take @xmath8 in equations ( 5.12)(5.13 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 as @xmath10 : in fact , any constant value of @xmath11 at infinity is allowed thanks to the invariance of the linear advection  diffusion equation ( [ pde ] ) with respect to the shift and scaling transformations .",
    "with three boundary conditions at @xmath3 and the decay conditions as @xmath10 , the initial - value problem for equation ( [ pde ] ) is over - determined and the third ( over - determining ) boundary condition at @xmath3 is used to find the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath13 .",
    "we shall consider the initial - value problem with the initial data @xmath14 for a suitable function @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , we assume that the profile @xmath16 decays monotonically to zero as @xmath10 and that @xmath17 is a non - degenerate maximum of @xmath15 such that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . if the solution @xmath1 losses monotonicity in @xmath21 during the dynamical evolution , for instance , due to the value of @xmath22 crossing @xmath17 from the negative side , then we say that the flow becomes non - physical for further times and the model breaks .",
    "simultaneously , this may mean that the velocity @xmath23 blows up , as it is defined for sufficiently strong solutions of the advection  diffusion equation ( [ pde ] ) by the contact equation : @xmath24 which follows by differentiation of ( [ pde ] ) in @xmath21 and setting @xmath25 .",
    "the main claim of @xcite based on numerical computations of the reduced equation ( [ pde ] ) as well as more complicated thin - film equations is that for any suitable @xmath15 , there is a finite positive time @xmath26 such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",

    "using laplace transform in spatial coordinate and green s function for the fourth - order diffusion equation , we derive an explicit solution of the boundary - value problem ( [ toy ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath46 , we show that the inhomogeneous boundary condition @xmath47 leads to the secular growth of the boundary value @xmath48 to positive infinity as @xmath49 . as a result , even if @xmath50 initially , the convexity of the solution @xmath1 at the boundary @xmath3 is lost in the finite time . in the case",
    "@xmath51 , we show that no secular growth is observed but the convexity of the solution at the boundary is still lost in the finite time .",
    "applying the same method , we prove local existence of solutions of the original boundary - value problem ( [ pde - u])([bc ] ) .",

    "because @xmath23 is nonconstant for the original problem ( [ pde ] ) , the laplace transform in time @xmath13 is not a useful method for this problem . on the other hand , since the boundary - value problem is formulated for half - line , we can use laplace transform in space @xmath21 : @xmath53 we shall develop this method to solve the boundary  value problem ( [ toy ] ) .",
