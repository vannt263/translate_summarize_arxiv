    "according to the standard theory of cosmological structure formation , most of the mass in galactic halos is composed of non - baryonic matter with negligible primordial velocity dispersion , commonly called cold dark matter ( cdm ) , the constitution of which remains a mystery .",
    "many theories have been proposed to account for the dark matter .",
    "dark matter candidates may be non - thermal relics or thermal relics , depending upon the underlying particle physics .",
    "non - thermal relics are particles which decoupled from the standard model particles without being in thermal equilibrium with them , the best example being the axion  @xcite . thermal relics on the other hand , were once in thermal equilibrium with other particles , but decoupled when their interaction rate became comparable to the hubble rate .",
    "these particles are collectively known as weakly interacting massive particles or wimps  @xcite .",
    "there are many collaborations currently trying to detect dark matter , which include admx  @xcite , dama / nai  @xcite , dama / libra  @xcite , cdms  @xcite , xenon  @xcite , edelweiss  @xcite , zeplin  @xcite , etc .",
    "dark matter detection experiments are usually of two kinds - direct detection experiments look for the recoil that occurs when a wimp scatters off a target nucleus , while indirect detection experiments look for standard model particles which result from dark matter particle annihilation . in this article",
    ", we investigate the flux of gamma ray photons produced by wimp annihilation in dark matter caustics .",
    "previous work on particle annihilation in caustics includes @xcite . for the possibility of detecting caustics by gravitational lensing ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "caustics and their associated cold flows are also relevant to direct detection experiments @xcite .",
    "cold dark matter particles exist on a thin 3-dimensional hypersurface in phase space . to obtain the density in physical space , we must make a mapping from phase space to physical space .",
    "caustics are locations where this mapping is singular  @xcite .",
    "caustics are made up of sections of the elementary catastrophes , which are structurally stable and have a definite geometry that depends on the structure of the phase space manifold . in the limit of zero velocity dispersion , caustics are singularities in physical space . in real galactic halos ,",
    "the velocity dispersion cuts off the divergence @xcite .",
    "it is important to ask whether the finite velocity dispersion of dark matter can soften the density contrast of caustics to the extent that the caustics are made irrelevant .",
    "the inner regions of phase space may well have thermalized over the age of the universe .",
    "the infall of thermal dark matter does not produce observable caustics .",
    "however , it is believed that in large galaxies like our own , there is a lot of dark matter well outside the virial radius , yet gravitationally bound to the halo .",
    "these dark matter particles are in the process of thermalizing and have velocity dispersions that are small compared to the virial velocity dispersion of the galaxy  @xcite .",
    "the dark matter particles reaching us today for the first time for example , are cold and are likely to produce a physically significant caustic .",
    "similarly the particles that have fallen into the inner regions of the halo only a few times in the past may be expected to produce observable caustics .",
    "thus caustics are formed if the outer regions of phase space are well resolved .",
    "an analysis of the rotation curves of 32 galaxies  @xcite seems to provide evidence for the existence of dark matter caustics .",
    "the rotation curve of our galaxy also shows rises at the expected locations of the caustics  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the best example of caustics on galactic scales is the occurrence of shells around giant elliptical galaxies  @xcite ( e.g. ngc 3923 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "these shells are caustics in the distribution of starlight .",
    "they form when a dwarf galaxy falls into the gravitational potential of a much larger galaxy and is assimilated by it .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the stars of the dwarf galaxy are much smaller than the virial velocity dispersion of the giant galaxy .",
    "the infall of stars is therefore cold and presumably , collisionless .",
    "the occurrence of these caustics show us that cold flows are not unstable and that caustics do not require special initial conditions to form  @xcite .",
    "this leads us to believe that the infall of non - thermal dark matter also produces caustics .",
    "there are two kinds of caustics - outer and inner  @xcite .",
    "the outer caustics are thin topological spheres surrounding galaxies ( like the caustic of stars discussed previously ) .",
    "they are simple fold catastrophes and typically occur on scales of 100 s of kpc for a galaxy like our own .",
    "the inner caustics have a more complicated geometry and are made up of sections of the higher order catastrophes  @xcite .",
    "inner caustics typically occur on scales of 10 s of kpc .    to see the formation of inner caustics , let us consider the infall of a perfectly cold flow of dark matter . if the infall is exactly spherically symmetric , the particle trajectories are radial and the infall produces a singularity at the center . if instead , the dark matter particles possess some distribution of angular momentum with respect to the halo center , the particle trajectories are non - radial , particularly in the inner regions of the halo . fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "shows an example of non - radial infall ( in cross section ) with the result that the dark matter density is enhanced along two thin fold catastrophe lines ( surfaces in 3-dim .",
    "space ) which meet at a cusp catastrophe point ( line in 3-dim .",
    "space )  @xcite .",
    "the caustic divides the @xmath1 space into two regions - one region with 1 particle trajectory passing through each point ( outer region ) and the other with 3 particle trajectories passing through each point ( inner region ) .",
    "close to the cusp , the dark matter trajectories are specified by the family of curves @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the co - ordinates of the cusp and @xmath4 are constants .",
    "@xmath5 parametrizes the family .",
    "the caustic is the envelope of the family of curves , i.e. the locus of points tangent to the curves .",
    "the envelope is obtained by solving eq .",
    "[ eq_1 ] together with the tangency condition @xmath6 , using which we obtain the caustic curve @xmath7 the density is proportional to the sum @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the real roots of the cubic eq .",

    "close to one of the fold lines and in the inner region , the density falls off as the inverse square root of the distance to the fold along the direction perpendicular to the fold . for arbitrary @xmath18",

    "[ eq_1 ] to obtain @xmath9 .",
    "the general solution is worked out in  @xcite .    for arbitrary initial conditions",
    ", other catastrophes can occur .",
    "in general , we may parametrize the flow of cold dark matter particles by a three parameter label @xmath19 where @xmath20 are three conveniently chosen parameters that describe the flow  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath21 be the physical space location at time @xmath22 , of the particle labeled @xmath23 and is obtained by solving the equations of motion for given initial conditions .",
    "the physical space density is proportional to the sum @xmath24 ( the jacobian determinant of the map from @xmath23 space to @xmath25 space ) and is infinite ( for a perfectly cold flow ) at those points where @xmath26 . for a perfectly cold flow",
    ", it can be shown that such a singularity necessarily occurs  @xcite .",
    "a perfectly cold flow can not be realized in practice .",
    "the primordial velocity dispersion of wimps is estimated to be @xmath27 km / s  @xcite .",
    "this causes the caustic surface to spread by an amount @xmath28  @xcite where @xmath29 is the outer turnaround radius ( few hundred kpc ) of the flow of particles forming the caustic and @xmath30 is the speed of the particles at the location of the ( inner ) caustic ( few @xmath31 100 @xmath32 km / s  @xcite ) .",
    "this minimum spread in the caustic surface sets an upper limit to the density .",
    "for the nearby caustics , we can estimate the spread in the caustic location @xmath33    let us now examine the effect of averaging the density over a finite region of space .",
    "fig  [ fig2-a ] shows the density along the line of sight , close to one of the fold lines of fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "close to the fold , but outside it , the dark matter density is very small .",
    "the density changes abruptly at the location of the fold and becomes very large ( 100 gev/@xmath34 was chosen as the density cut - off ) , decreasing smoothly thereafter .",
    "figures  [ fig2-b ] ,  [ fig2-c ] and  [ fig2-d ] show the density averaged over a cube of side 0.01 parsec , 0.1 parsec and 1 parsec respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig2-b ] , we see that the averaged density follows the true density faithfully , though the maximum averaged density does not quite reach the cut - off value .",
    "[ fig2-c ] no longer shows a sharp rise in density and fig .",
    "[ fig2-d ] misses the caustic completely .",
    "we conclude that caustics are sub - parsec scale structures and are therefore difficult to resolve with large scale cosmological simulations which typically have spatial resolutions of 100 s of pc .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , a good candidate for the wimp is the lightest neutralino which is a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the neutral electroweak gauge bosons and the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the characteristics of the annihilation signal depend both on the composition of the wimp and its mass @xmath35 .",
    "the line emission signal ( @xmath36 ) is loop suppressed and is therefore smaller than the continuum signal .",
    "the continuum flux ( number of photons received with energies ranging from @xmath37 to @xmath38 per unit detector area , per unit solid angle , per unit time ) is given by  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 is the number of photons produced per annihilation channel per unit energy , @xmath42 is the branching fraction of channel @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the thermally averaged cross section times the relative velocity .",
    "the factor of 2 in the denominator accounts for the fact that two wimps disappear per annihilation .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 is called the emission measure and is the dark matter density squared , integrated along the line of sight , i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 represents the emission measure in the direction @xmath48 averaged over a cone of angular extent @xmath49 .",
