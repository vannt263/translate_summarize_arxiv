    "semiconductor lasers have become an inexpensive easy - to - handle source of coherent light .",
    "applications in many fields such as atomic physics , metrology and telecommunication require single mode operation with narrow linewidth and good tunability @xcite .",
    "this is frequently achieved by incorporating the laser diode into an external cavity where optical feedback and wavelength discrimination are provided by a diffraction grating @xcite .",
    "however , such a design is sensitive to the ambient pressure @xcite and to optical misalignment @xcite induced by mechanical or thermal deformation .",
    "in addition , for the common littrow configuration , the direction or position of the output beam depends on the wavelength @xcite .",
    "an alternative design employs a fabry - prot etalon as wavelength discriminator , operating in transmission @xcite . in that case",
    "the two tasks of wavelength selection and feedback reflection are carried - out by two different optical elements .",
    "the etalon can either be formed from a thin air gap between two glass plates or a single , thin ( @xmath0 m ) solid plate .",
    "both solutions are costly , can be fragile and exhibit multiple resonances . furthermore , we observe that the absorption of atmospheric water can shift the transmitted wavelength to the point of uselessness after two years .",
    "better robustness and unique transmission is provided by narrow - band dielectric interference filters .",
    "their use in an extended cavity laser has been demonstrated for telecom wavelength in @xcite .",
    "the emission from the anti - reflection coated back facet of a @xmath1  nm laser diode is fed - back by a `` cat s eye '' ( lens + mirror ) .",
    "an interference filter of 2  nm passband width and 70  % peak transmission acts as intra - cavity wavelength discriminator .    here",
    ", we present filters having 90  % transmission and @xmath2  nm fwhm at near infra - red and visible wavelengths .",
    "the external cavity is added to the output beam , while the diode s back facet is coated for high reflectivity . the cavity outcoupler is a partially reflecting mirror . changing its reflectivity is an easy way of optimizing the feed - back .",
    "the diode s output facet has no particular high - quality anti - reflection coating giving rise to a second cavity formed by the laser chip itself , but making it inexpensive .",
    "chaotic coupling to adjacent chip modes is efficiently suppressed by the narrow bandwidth of our filter , up to 8 times the threshold current .",
    "we show that the sensitivity of these lasers to environmental perturbations is drastically reduced as compared to the littrow configuration .",
    "we demonstrate tunability over a broader wavelength range thanks to the possibility of optimizing the amount of feedback independently from the wavelength selection mechanism .",
    "we study the lasers spectral noise .",
    "a schematic of the external cavity is given in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "the light emitted from the diode ( dl ) is collimated by an objective lens ( lc ) with short focal length ( 3 to 4.5 mm ) and high numerical aperture ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the lens is chosen to compensate for abberations arising from the diode s packaging window .",
    "a partially reflecting mirror , here named out - coupler ( oc ) provides the feedback into the diode .",
    "the oc is displaced by a piezo - electric transducer ( pzt ) in order to vary the cavity length . a narrow - band high - transmission interference filter ( fi )",
    "is introduced into the cavity .",
    "the filter provides the frequency selectivity usually obtained by replacing the out - coupler with a diffraction grating . with this set - up",
    ", we are able to achieve single - mode , tunable operation . in addition much better stability against optical misalignment",
    "is achieved by focussing the collimated beam in a `` cat s eye '' onto the out - coupler .",
    "we typically employ a lens ( l1 ) of 18  mm focal length .",
    "a second , similar lens ( l2 ) provides a collimated output beam .",
    "contrary to the littrow laser design , reflection and wavelength discrimination are provided by two different elements so that the amount of feedback can easily be optimized .    in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] the diode s back facet is coated for high reflection .",
    "alternatively , this facet can have low reflection to provide the output beam . in that case one chooses oc with maximum reflectivity .    ]",
    "for a littrow laser wavelength discrimination is given by the bragg condition @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the grating s line spacing and @xmath6 the angle of incidence .",
    "for wavelengths in the near infra - red , typical values are @xmath7   lines / mm and @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to @xmath9nm / mrad . tuning the laser",
    "redirects the output beam by @xmath10mrad / nm or , if a mirror is attached to the grating mount@xcite , leads to a transverse displacement of @xmath11m / nm ( assuming a distance of 15  mm between the grating and the mirror ) .    wavelength discrimination of our filter is based on multiple reflection within its dielectric coatings and behaves as a thin fabry - prot etalon with effective index of refraction @xmath12 . the transmitted wavelength is given by @xmath13 where @xmath6 is again the angle of incidence .",
    "@xmath14 is the wavelength at normal incidence .",
    "a typical value is @xmath15 ( see section [ sectionfilter ] ) .",
    "we choose the nominal wavelength to be transmitted at @xmath16 of incidence which , for @xmath17  nm leads to @xmath18 this is 60 times smaller than for the littrow configuration .",
    "the corresponding reduction of the sensitivity of the wavelength against mechanical instabilities is a clear advantage of our design .",
    "note that this reduction is not achieved at the expense of a reduced tunability ( see section [ section698 ] ) .",
    "tuning the filter displaces the output beam by @xmath19 due to the 0.5  mm thick fused - silica filter substrate ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is two times smaller than for the modified littrow laser .",
    "note that if one chooses to out - couple from the diode s back facet , the displacement is further reduced .",
    "we now study the sensitivity of the laser to a misalignment of the external cavity that does not affect the emission wavelength but the optical feedback . we consider a gaussian beam with electric field @xmath21 being emitted from the output facet of the diode ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "its propagation through the external cavity ( along @xmath23 ) can be modeled in the paraxial approximation giving the reflected electric field @xmath24 at the output facet of the diode .",
    "the feedback @xmath25 is given by the overlap integral of the reflected and emitted electric fields .",
    "for convenience we normalize by the reflectivity @xmath26 of the grating / out - coupler .",
    "the variation of @xmath27 under misalignment reflects the mechanical and thermal sensitivity of the laser .",
    "two sources of misalignment are considered : tilt of the out - coupler ( grating ) and axial displacement of the out - coupler .",
    "displacements of other optical elements can be transformed into one of these .",
    "the computation of @xmath27 turns out to be independent of the number of lenses in the cavity , and can be simplified by calculating the overlap integral @xmath28 at the position @xmath29 of the reflective element @xcite . here",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the incident and reflected electric fields on the out - coupler .",
    "we assume that the incident beam is perfectly aligned so that it forms a waist of @xmath32 radius @xmath33 on the out - coupler .",
    "if @xmath34 is the angle formed by the incident and reflected beam due to a small tilt of the out - coupler , we find @xcite @xmath35\\label{tilt}\\ ] ] and for @xmath36 @xmath37 note that @xmath38 is the @xmath39 divergence angle .",
    "on the other hand , if the reflective element is displaced along the optical axis by @xmath40 , the reflected beam has a radius of curvature @xmath41 and @xmath32 radius @xmath42 with rayleigh length @xmath43 .",
    "this gives @xmath44 and for @xmath45 @xmath46    equations [ derivtilt ] and [ displacement ] show that @xmath33 is the only parameter which determines the sensitivity of the optical feedback to misalignment . in grating - tuned extended cavity lasers ,",
    "the beam waist is essentially determined by the selectivity requirement and is of the order of 1 mm .",
    "this leads to a rather poor trade - off between angular and displacement sensitivity .",
    "indeed , a tilt of the grating of @xmath47rad is sufficient to decrease the coupling factor @xmath27 by @xmath48% , while a similar reduction due to a pure displacement would correspond to @xmath49 m . in the new scheme described here",
    "the separation of the wavelength selection and optical feedback allows to choose a more favorable value for @xmath33 . in our cat s eye setup @xmath50 m .",
    "hence , the tilt or displacement reducing @xmath27 by 10  % ( @xmath51mrad or @xmath52 mm respectively ) are both very large deformations .",
    "the interference filter @xcite is formed of a series of dielectric coatings on an optical substrate with anti - reflection coated back face .",
    "it is calculated to transmit more than 90  % of the intensity at the nominal wavelength at @xmath16 incidence .",
    "the fullwidth at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the transmission curve is chosen as 0.3  nm , which is about twice the mode spacing of a typical laser diode .",
    "filters with even higher finesse can be produced only at the cost of reduced transmission .",
    "the chosen compromise turns out to provide sufficient discrimination for stable single mode lasing with satisfactory output power ( see section [ laser852 ] ) .",
    "the samples tested here are fabricated on larger optical wafers and then cut into pieces of @xmath53 , thereby reducing the production costs .",
    "we test several fabrication batches at 698 , 780 and 852  nm nominal wavelength . in the following the measurements on a 852  nm filter",
    "are described .",
    "similar results are obtained for the other wavelengths .",
    "the transmission of a 1.2  mm diameter collimated beam of known wavelength is measured .",
    "[ finessfilter ] shows the results as a function of the angle of incidence for a 852.1  nm beam ( @xmath54 ) and a 843.9  nm beam ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the first maximum has 89  % transmission at @xmath56 and a fwhm of @xmath57 .",
    "the 843.9  nm light is transmitted to 84  % at @xmath58 with a fwhm of @xmath59 . using equation [ tunability ] we fit @xmath60  nm and @xmath61 .",
    "this leads to @xmath62  nm for 852  nm and @xmath63  nm for 844  nm .",
    "the transmission peaks are well fitted by a lorentzian taking the wavelength as argument .",
    "if the filter is used at a wavelength 8  nm below its nominal value the transmission drops by 5  % only . repeating the measurement on 6 different production batches , we find less than 5  % variation of the maximum transmission at 852.1  nm .    in a second set of measurements , the transmission at 852.1  nm is determined as a function of the incident polarization . a sinusoidal variation from 89  % to 75  %",
    "is observed when the linear polarization rotates from parallel to perpendicular with respect to the axis of inclination .",
    "thirdly , the transmission is analyzed as a function of the position on the filter ( fig .",
    "[ posfilter ] ) .",
    "a 0.5 mm wide slit is placed in the 852.1  nm beam .",
    "having optimized the angle of incidence at the center and keeping it fixed ( @xmath55 ) , the right half of the filter shows good homogeneous transmission , whereas the transmission drops drastically towards the left edge .",
    "when the angle of incidence is optimized at each position ( @xmath54 ) , the transmission can be recovered to @xmath64  % .",
    "the corresponding angle at the left edge is 0.6 mrad bigger than the optimum angle at the center .",
    "[ posfilter ] represents a batch with good spatial homogeneity .",
    "stronger variations are observed for other samples .",
    "this result indicates that smaller beam diameters ( @xmath65  mm ) are favorable",
    ".    finally we test the filters under vacuum . at a residual pressure of @xmath66  pa",
    ", we do not observe any variation of the optimal angle of transmission compared to atmospheric pressure to within our experimental resolution ( 5  ghz when expressed in terms of frequency ) . to ensure that desorption of residual gas from the coatings does not influence this result ,",
    "the vacuum is kept over one month .",
    "this makes the filter a perfectly suited candidate for wavelength selection in space - born lasers .",
    "following the design of fig . [ schematic ] ,",
    "a laser at 852  nm is built .",
    "the diode ( sdl 5422 ) nominally emits 150  mw for a current of @xmath67  ma at 854  nm .",
    "the output facet coating is specified to induce less than 4  % reflection .",
    "we measure the free spectral range of the naked diode as @xmath68  ghz ( 0.13 nm ) , which corresponds to a physical length of @xmath69  mm assuming the index of refraction of gaas ( @xmath70 ) @xcite .    the collimating lens has a focal length of 4.5  mm . l1 and l2 have focal length @xmath71 and 11  mm , respectively .",
    "the out - coupler is an optical flat of 10  mm diameter and 3  mm thickness .",
    "it is coated partially reflective on the inner face and anti - reflection on the outer .",
    "it is glued onto a 10  mm diameter pzt tube of 1  mm wall thickness and 10  mm length .",
    "the overall length of the external cavity is 70  mm .",
    "different reflection coefficients of the oc are tried .",
    "the output power at @xmath72  ma is 47 , 40 and 30 mw for 15 , 20 and 30  % reflectivity , respectively . at 15 and 20",
    "% reflection , single mode operation is obtained for certain intervals of the diode current only . at 30  % reflection stable single mode lasing is assured from the threshold current ( @xmath73  ma ) to 8 times its value .",
    "operation on the same diode mode is assured within a span of 4  mrad of filter inclination ( 44  ghz ) , before an adjacent mode of the diode is selected .",
    "this demonstrates the small sensitivity of our design to a tilt of the selective element ( equation [ dlambdadthetafilter ] ) .    in order to determine the laser s spectral properties , we measure the beat signal between two identical set - ups separated in frequency by @xmath74  ghz . the observed spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ batement ] .",
    "the first laser is locked to the d2 line of cs .",
    "the second one is locked ( with a bandwidth of 15  khz ) to the first one so that the beat frequency stays constant .",
    "the remaining higher frequency noise leads to a random distribution of the central beat frequency , which is well fitted by a gaussian ( solid line ) .",
    "we fit the points within @xmath75  mhz from the center and find a fwhm of 155  khz . the wings ( @xmath76  mhz ) of the beat signal",
    "can be fitted by a lorentzian ( dashed line ) giving the high frequency noise of the laser .",
    "its fwhm of 28  khz indicates that the white noise level of each laser corresponds to a linewidth of 14  khz .",
    "an even smaller white noise floor may be obtained by means of stronger optical feedback or a longer external cavity .    because of the filter s vacuum compatibility and the mechanical stability of our prototype , the design of fig .",

    "no emission at 698  nm is observed for 40  % reflection . finally , due to operation at the very edge of the gain curve , the possibility to tune the laser by varying the current of the diode laser is limited to 40ghz , as compared to 70 ghz if the diode is emitting at its nominal wavelength .",
    "the tunability of this laser is significantly larger than we had formerly achieved with grating feedback .",
