    "we perform the computation of the flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decay of the top quark into a charm quark and a neutral higgs particle in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is any of the neutral higgs particles of the mssm , namely the light or heavy cp - even ( `` scalar '' ) higgs bosons ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , or the cp - odd ( `` pseudoscalar '' ) higgs ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we compute the contributions from the susy electroweak , higgs , and susy - qcd sectors , in a sparticle mass model motivated by model building and renormalization group equations ( rge ) .",
    "however , we neither restrict ourselves to a spectrum of any susy - gut model ( such as sugra ) which would constrain the masses in a narrow range , nor to a generic , phenomenological motivated , spectrum which would have too many parameters to play with .",
    "there exist some computations of fcnc top quark decays , both in the sm and in the mssm@xcite .",
    "there has been some work concerning the decay channel into gauge bosons ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , see for example ref.@xcite for some works on the subject .",
    "the conclusion of these works is that the branching ratio of this decay is at most @xmath9 , maybe a bit larger in the gluon channel .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there are not so many works on the fcnc decay of the top quark into higgs in the mssm@xcite , and they are not so complete as in the case of the gauge bosons .",
    "for example in  @xcite it is concluded that the branching ratio for the decay channel @xmath2 in the mssm is at most of @xmath10 , for the susy electroweak contributions , and @xmath9 , for the susy - qcd contributions .",
    "however we think that the work of  @xcite is not complete .",
    "they do not include effects of the higgs particles in the loops , and they do not take into account the @xmath11 vertices , so they miss the potentially large contributions coming from the trilinear soft - susy - breaking terms @xmath12 , and from the higgsino mass parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we find that a full treatment of the susy - qcd contributions may greatly enhance the fcnc width by some orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , a more general , and more rigorous , computation of the decay @xmath2 is mandatory@xcite .    in section  [ sec : gen ]",
    "we make a summary of the technics of the computation , in sections  [ sec : ew ] and  [ sec : qcd ] we present our results for the susy electroweak and the susy - qcd contributions to the decay width @xmath2 respectively , and finally we present the conclusions .",
    "the computation of fcnc processes at one loop , unlike other calculations , does not involve renormalization of parameters , or wave functions , so one is left only with the computation of the different diagrams that contribute to the process .",
    "the generic one loop diagrams contributing to the decay under study are in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "the vertex diagram @xmath14 follows after a straightforward calculation . as for the diagrams @xmath15 and @xmath16 we define a mixed self - energy ,",
    "@xmath17 where the @xmath18 factor multiplying the scalar part is arbitrary , put there only to maintain the same units between the different @xmath19 , and compute the effects of @xmath19 to the amplitude .",
    "we compute the different contributions to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 and define an `` effective '' vertex @xmath20    we have taken into account all three generations of quarks and squarks , and have performed the usual checks of the computation , in particular that the form factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 are free of divergences before adding up the three quark generations , both analytically and numerically in the implementation of the code .    after squaring the matrix element  ( [ eq : effvertex ] ) , and multiplying by the phase space factor , we can compute the decay width , and define the ratio @xmath23 which will be the main object under study .",
    "this ratio is not the total branching fraction of this decay mode , as there are many other channels that should be added up to the denominator of ( [ eq : defbr ] ) in the mssm , such as the two and three body decays of the top quark into susy particles , and also the decay channel @xmath24@xcite .",
    "for the mass spectrum used in the numerical analysis ( see sections  [ sec : ew ] and  [ sec : qcd ] ) the former are phase space closed , whereas the latter could have a large branching ratio .",
    "we would like to single out two pieces of the interaction lagrangian , namely the ones involving higgsino - sbottom - charm and higgs - bottom - charm @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ckm matrix element , and @xmath27 are the charm and bottom yukawa couplings . looking at these two pieces of the lagrangian one can get an estimation of the relative importance of the different form factors  ( [ eq : effvertex ] ) ( see section  [ sec : ew ] ) .",
    "for the electroweak contributions to the decay channel @xmath2 we work in the so called super - ckm basis , that is , we take the simplification that the squark mass matrix diagonalizes as the quark mass matrix , so that fcnc processes appear at one loop through the charged sector ( charged higgs and charginos ) with the same mixing matrix elements as in the standard model ( the ckm matrix ) .",
    "we introduce , as usual , the left - right mass matrix mixing elements between squarks@xcite : @xmath28 .",
    "we have taken into account the contributions from charginos ( @xmath29 ) and down type squarks ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the mass eigenstates down squarks ) , and from charged higgs and goldstone bosons ( @xmath32 ) and down type quarks ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we have not included the diagrams with gauge bosons ( @xmath34 ) as the largest contributions will come from the yukawa couplings of the top and ( at large @xmath35 ) bottom quarks .",
    "however , the leading terms from longitudinal @xmath34 are included through the inclusion of goldstone bosons .",
    "the input parameters chosen to illustrate the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : formew]-[fig : resultsew ] are : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the lightest @xmath38 and @xmath39 mass , and all the masses are above present experimental bounds@xcite-@xcite , though the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs ( @xmath40 ) is in the edge of present * lep * bounds@xcite , and it is possibly excluded by the last analyses on the charged higgs mass@xcite . however , this light higgs mass is not essential in the results , as can bee seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsew ]  ( d ) .",
    "we have chosen a susy mass spectrum around @xmath41 , which is not too light , so the results will not be artificially optimized .",
    "we have also checked all through the numerical analysis that other bounds on experimental parameters ( such as @xmath42 ) are fulfilled .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : formew ] we have plotted the different form factors of  ( [ eq : effvertex ] ) as a function of @xmath35 for the channel with the lightest scalar higgs ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we can see that the contributions from the higgs sector and the contributions from the chargino sector are of the same order .",
    "it turns out that they can be either of the same sign , or of opposite sign .",
    "the chosen negative value for @xmath43 is to make the two contributions of the same sign .",
    "it is also clear that in both cases @xmath44 .",
    "this can be easily understood by looking at the interaction lagrangians involving higgsino - sbottom - charm and higgs - bottom - charm  ( [ eq : mainew ] ) where we can see that in both of them the contribution to the right - handed form factor will be enhanced by the yukawa coupling of the bottom quark , compared with the charm yukawa coupling that will contribute to the left - handed form factor . on the other hand",
    "we have checked that the inclusion of the first two generations of quarks and squarks only has an effect of a few percent on the total result .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsew ] we can see the evolution of the ratio  ( [ eq : defbr ] ) with various parameters of the mssm , by taking into account only the electroweak contributions . the growing of the width with @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsew ]  ( a ) ) shows that the bottom yukawa coupling plays a central role in these contributions . the evolution with the trilinear coupling @xmath43 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath13 the two parameters that appear in the trilinear coupling @xmath45 displayed in figs .  [ fig : resultsew ]  ( b ) and  ( c ) shows that this parameters can enhance the width some orders of magnitude .",
    "we have artificially let @xmath43 grow up to large scales ( that are not allowed if one wants that squarks do not develop vacuum expectation values ) in order to emphasize the dependence on @xmath43 .",
    "the various spikes in these figures reflect the points where the form factors change sign , whereas the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsew ]  ( c ) reflects the exclusion region of @xmath13 by present * lep * bounds on the chargino mass .    in all these figures the ratio  ( [ eq : defbr ] ) is smaller for the heaviest scalar higgs ( @xmath5 ) because with the parameters  ( [ eq : inputew ] ) the cp - even higgs mixing angle @xmath46 is near @xmath47 , so making the couplings of @xmath5 with down quarks and squarks much weaker , but in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsew ]  ( d ) it can be seen that when the pseudoscalar higgs mass grows ( and this shifts @xmath46 far away from @xmath47 ) the two scalar higgs change roles .",
    "we conclude that the typical value of the ratio  ( [ eq : defbr ] ) , at large @xmath48 and for a susy spectrum around @xmath41 , is @xmath49    this is an improvement of the previous results@xcite , specially in the @xmath6 channel , by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "the gluino - mediated supersymmetric strong interactions in the mssm can also produce fcnc processes .",
    "this occurs when the squark mass matrix does not diagonalize with the same matrix as the one for the quarks .",
    "we introduce then intergenerational mass terms for the squarks , but in order to prevent the number of parameters from being too large , we have allowed ( symmetric ) mixing mass terms only for the left - handed squarks .",
    "this simplification is often used in the mssm , and is justified by rge analysis@xcite .",
    "the mixing terms are introduced through the parameters @xmath50 defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass of the left - handed @xmath53 squark , and @xmath54 is the mixing mass matrix element between the generations @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "these parameters are constrained by low energy data on fcnc@xcite .",
    "the bounds have been computed using some approximations , so they must be taken as order of magnitude limits .",
    "we use the following bounds on the @xmath56 parameters@xcite @xmath57    we compute the contributions to diagrams of fig .  [",
    "fig : diagrams ] with gluinos ( @xmath58 ) and up squarks ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "we use the same input parameters as in the electroweak contributions  ( [ eq : inputew ] ) , except for the @xmath13 parameter , namely @xmath61    a comment is in order for the present set of inputs : we have introduced in  ( [ eq : inputew ] ) the lightest stop mass as an input , and this stop is mostly a @xmath62 . however , in this new parametrization we introduce this mass as the lightest @xmath59 mass , which will be mostly a @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "we use a larger absolute value for the @xmath13 parameter to enhance the ratio  ( [ eq : defbr ] ) .",
    "again the largest contribution comes from the right - handed form factor of  ( [ eq : effvertex ] ) , but this is only because we have chosen not to introduce mixing between right - handed squarks .",
    "we have plotted the evolution of the ratio  ( [ eq : defbr ] ) with some parameters of the mssm in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsqcd ] . as can be easily guessed , the most important parameter for these contributions is the mixing mass parameter between the 2nd and 3rd generation of left - handed squarks , the less restricted one of the three ( eq .  (",
    "[ eq : limdelta ] ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsqcd ]  ( a ) it is shown that changing @xmath63 by 3 orders of magnitude , the ratio  ( [ eq : defbr ] ) can increase by 7 orders of magnitude !",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsqcd ]  ( b ) that the @xmath13 parameter also plays an important role , like in the electroweak contributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsew ]  ( c ) ) , and for the same reasons , bringing the ratio  ( [ eq : defbr ] ) up to values of @xmath64 .",
    "notice that the central region of @xmath65 is excluded by present * lep * bounds on the chargino mass .    the evolution with the gluino mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsqcd ]  ( c ) ) is asymptotically quite stable , showing a slow decoupling . finally in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsqcd ]  ( d ) we have plotted the evolution with the pseudoscalar higgs mass , it is also quite stable , until near the kinematic limit for @xmath6 and @xmath5 .    we conclude that the typical value of the susy - qcd contributions to  ( [ eq : defbr ] ) , with a susy spectrum around @xmath41 , is @xmath66 but in favourable regions of the parameter space ( i.e. large @xmath13 , or relatively light gluino ) it can easily reach values of @xmath64 .",
    "this is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger from the previous estimate@xcite .",
    "we have computed the susy - electroweak , higgs , and susy - qcd contributions to the fcnc top quark decay @xmath2 ( @xmath67 ) in the mssm , using a mass spectrum motivated , but not fully restricted , by model building and renormalization group equations .",
    "we have found that with a susy mass spectrum around @xmath41 , which is well above present bounds@xcite , the different contributions to this decay are typically of the order @xmath68    the difference of at least two orders of magnitude between the two contributions makes worthless to compute the interference between the two contributions , but if the limits on @xmath63 ( eq .  ( [ eq : limdelta ] ) ) improve , it should be necessary to make the full computation .",
    "the results  ( [ eq : confinal ] ) are an improvement of the previous results@xcite , specially in the @xmath6 channel , thanks to the inclusion of the @xmath11 vertex",
    ".    it would probably be difficult that this decay can be measured either at the * tevatron * , or at the * nlc * , but there exists a possibility for * lhc*. as an example to assess the discovery reach of this accelerators the fcnc top quark decays into a vector boson are@xcite @xmath69 where the lack of sensitivity of * nlc * is due to the lower luminosity .",
    "so , if the discovery reach for fcnc higgs processes are not very different from that of the gauge bosons , there is a possibility to measure this decay channel at * lhc * even if susy particles are not seen at * lepii*.    * acknowledgements : * this talk is based in a work done in collaboration with joan sol@xcite , whom i am very thankful for his interesting comments and discussions .",
