    "supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) provide a very attractive framework for representing particles and forces of nature as they solve the gauge hierarchy problem , unify three forces of nature , and also explain tiny neutrino masses through seesaw paradigm @xcite while providing possible cold dark matter candidates of the universe",
    ". an evidence of supersymmetry at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) would be a land - mark discovery which would certainly change the future course of physics .",
    "but , in the absence of any evidence of supersymmetry so far , it is worth while to explore new physics prospects of nonsupersymmetric ( non - susy ) guts @xcite and , particularly , those based upon @xmath0 which has grown in popularity as it unifies all fermions of one generation including the right - handed ( rh ) neutrino into a single spinorial representation .",
    "it provides spontaneous origins of p ( @xmath10 parity ) and cp violations @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , in addition to predicting the right order of tiny neutrino masses through mechanisms called the canonical ( @xmath11 type - i ) @xcite seesaw and type - ii @xcite seesaw , it has high potentiality to explain all fermion masses @xcite including large mixings in the neutrino sector @xcite with type - ii seesaw dominance @xcite .",
    "in fact neither seesaw mechanism , nor grand unification require supersymmetry per se .",
    "although gauge couplings automatically unify in the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite , and they fail to unify through the minimal particle content of the standard model ( sm ) in one - step breaking of non - susy su(5 ) or so(10 ) , they do unify once intermediate symmetries are included to populate the grand desert in case of non - susy so(10 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , with intermediate gauge symmetries @xmath0 also predicts signals of new physics which can be probed at low or accelerator energies . +",
    "a hallmark of @xmath0 grand unification is its underlying quark - lepton symmetry @xcite because of which the canonical seesaw scale is pushed closer to the gut scale making it naturally inaccessible to direct tests by low - energy experiments or collider searches .",
    "the energy scale of type - ii seesaw mechanism in @xmath0 is also too high for direct experimental tests .",
    "in contrast to these high scale seesaw mechanisms , an experimentally verifiable and attractive mechanism that has been recently introduced into @xmath0 @xcite is the radiative seesaw @xcite where the quark - lepton unification has no role to play and additional suppression to light neutrino mass prediction occurs by loop mediation proportional to a small higgs quartic coupling that naturally emerges from a plank - scale induced term in the gut lagrangian .",
    "the model predicts a rich structure of prospective dark matter candidates also verifiable by ongoing search experiments .",
    "it has been further noted that this embedding of the radiative seesaw in @xmath0 may have a promising prospect for representing all fermion masses . a number of other interesting neutrino mass generation mechanisms including type - iii seesaw , double seesaw , linear seesaw , scalar- triplet seesaw have been suggested and some of them are also experimentally verifiable @xcite .    in the context of non - susy @xmath0 in this work our purpose is to explore the prospects of another neutrino mass generation mechanism called the inverse seesaw @xcite which is also different from canonical or type - ii seesaw mechanism and has the potentiality to be experimentally verifiable because of the low scale at which it can operate although higher scale inverse seesaw models have been suggested @xcite . in a large class of models @xcite , the implementation requires the introduction of fermionic singlets under the gauge group of the model .",
    "likewise , its implementation in @xmath0 introduces a new mass scale @xmath12 into the lagrangian corresponding to the mass matrix of the additional singlet fermions of three generations and the tev - scale seesaw requires this parameter to be small .",
    "there is an interesting naturalness argument in favor of its smallness based upon exact lepton number conservation symmetry @xcite . below the tev scale , in the limit @xmath13",
    ", the corresponding lagrangian has a leptonic global @xmath14 symmetry which guarantees left - handed neutrinos to remain massless .",
    "the small value of @xmath15 essentially needed to match the neutrino oscillation data with the tev - scale inverse seesaw formula may be taken as a consequence of very mild breaking of the exact global symmetry .",
    "thus the small value of the parameter protected by the exact lepton number conservation is natural in the t hooft sense @xcite .",
    "however , inspite of such interesting naturalness argument , there has been no dynamical understanding of its origin so far although an interpretation using higgs mechanism has been given in the context of a model with extended gauge , fermion and higgs sectors @xcite . in a different class of @xmath0 models ,",
    "the small singlet fermion mass parameter has been generated radiatively @xcite where more nonstandard fermions have been found to be necessary . in susy @xmath0 singlet fermions have also been used to derive new forms of fermion mass matrix while predicting standard fermion mass ratios @xcite and to obtain new seesaw formula for neutrinos while explaining baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis @xcite . while most of the inverse seesaw models need gauge singlet fermions under the sm gauge group or its extensions @xcite and the use of @xmath0-singlet fermions may point to the disadvantages of the corresponding gut - based models , extended electroweak theory based upon @xmath16 gauge symmetry @xcite contains such singlets in its fundamental representations . to give some examples of guts , one @xmath0-singlet fermion per generation",
    "is automatically contained in the @xmath17 dimensional fermion representation of @xmath18 @xcite where @xmath19 under @xmath0 but @xmath20 under @xmath21 and , in the latter case , an additional discrete @xmath22 symmetry is needed to qualify it as a trinification gut model @xcite .",
    "interesting properties of @xmath23 gauge theory including experimentally verifiable predictions at accelerator energies have been discussed @xcite .",
    "gauge boson mediated proton decays are suppressed in @xmath23 type of models .",
    "in addition to the rh neutrino and the other singlet fermion needed for inverse seesaw , these models ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) also contain @xmath25 nonstandard fermions per generation and no experimental data are yet available on their masses at low energies so as to persue the present bottom - up approach to derive the dirac neutrino mass matrix from fermion mass fits at the gut scale .",
    "the same argument holds against any other model that may contain additional nonstandard fermions beyond the rh neutrino and the singlet - fermion needed for inverse seesaw .    regarding the potentiality of so(10 ) motivated inverse seesaw in the visible sector , the same quark - lepton symmetry that forces canonical seesaw scale to be far beyond the experimentally accessible range , makes the tev - scale inverse seesaw predict observable nonunitarity effects as new physics signals verifiable at low and accelerator energies and at neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "recently in a series of interesting investigations , using inverse seesaw mechanism , bhupal dev and mohapatra @xcite have shown that susy @xmath0 , besides admitting a low spontaneous breaking scale of @xmath26 gauge symmetry with right handed gauge bosons @xmath1 and @xmath2 accessible to lhc , is also capable of fitting all fermion masses and mixings at the gut scale while predicting observable nonunitarity effects .",
    "the model has been also shown to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis caused due to the decay of tev scale masses of the pseudo dirac rh neutrinos @xcite .",
    "currently considerable attention has been devoted to propose models with an extra neutral @xmath2 gauge boson which may also emerge from pati - salam or left - right gauge theories , or @xmath0 and @xmath24 grand unified theories , or also from string inspired models @xcite .",
    "different from the supersymmetric @xmath0 model of ref.@xcite , here we adopt the view that there may not be any manifestation of supersymmetry at accelerator energies and that the actual parity restoration scale may be high . instead of both the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 boson masses being low , there may be only some remnants of high scale left - right symmetry or quark lepton symmetry manifesting at low and accelerator energies as smoking gun signatures such as the @xmath2 @xcite gauge boson and the associated nonunitarity effects of the tev - scale inverse seesaw . with this point of view in this work",
    "we show that a non - susy @xmath0 with @xmath27 gauge symmetry at the tev scale and left - right gauge theory at higher intermediate scale , with or without d - parity , achieves precision gauge coupling unification , and predicts a low mass @xmath2 making them suitable for implementation of tev - scale inverse seesaw mechanism .",
    "the model can also be verified or falsified through its predictions on observable nonunitarity effects and additional contributions to lepton flavor violations .",
    "another testing ground for the model could be through the @xmath0 prediction on gauge boson mediated proton decay on which dedicated search experiments are ongoing .",
    "we derive renormalization group equations in the presence of two intermediate gauge symmetries for running fermion masses and mixings , and determine the dirac neutrino mass at the tev scale from successful fits to the fermion masses at the gut scale . in this approach",
    "we find a simple relation between the rh neutrino masses in the model .",
    "we also point out a different type of relation in the partial degenerate case that permits much lower values of rh neutrino masses resulting in a cp - violating phase increased by @xmath28 orders larger than the degenerate case . some of our predictions include branching ratios for @xmath29 enhanced by @xmath30 orders . out of the two minimal models , while the intermediate scale d - parity conserving model is ruled out by proton decay constraint , the proton lifetime for @xmath6 in the intermediate scale d - parity nonconserving model is predicted to be well within the accessible range of ongoing search experiments .",
    "we have also discussed simple extensions of the two models with longer proton lifetime predictions .",
    "this method can also be implemented using pati - salam model or left - right models @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in sec.2",
    "we briefly discuss the model and carry out gauge coupling unification and proton lifetime predictions in sec.3 . with a brief explanation of inverse seesaw mechanism in sec.4 we summarize relevant formulas encoding nonunitarity effects and lepton flavor violations . in sec.5",
    "we discuss renormalization group evolution of fermion masses and mixings to the gut scale in the presence of nonsupersymmetric gauge theories @xmath31 and @xmath32 at intermediate scales . in this section",
    "we also show how fermion masses are fitted at the gut scale and information on the dirac neutrino mass matrix is obtained .",
    "nonunitarity effects are discussed in sec.6 with predictions on the moduli of relevant matrix elements . in sec.7",
    "we give predictions on cp - violating parameters and lepton flavor violation where we also discuss possible limitations of the present models .",
    "in sec.8 we provide a brief summary and discussion along with conclusion . in the appendix",
    "a we provide beta function coefficients for gauge coupling unification while in appendix b we summarize derivations of renormalization group equations ( rges ) for fermion masses and mixings .",
    "there has been extensive investigation on physically appealing intermediate scale models @xcite in non - susy @xmath0 .",
    "although in the minimal two step - breaking of non - susy @xmath0 models @xcite we found no suitable chain with a sufficiently low scale to implement the inverse seesaw , the following chain with two intermediate gauge symmetries appears to be quite suitable , so(10 ) & & g_i + & & su(2)_l u(1)_r u(1)_b - lsu(3)_c  [ g_2113 ] + & & su(2)_l u(1)_ysu(3)_c  [ sm ] + & & su(3)_c u(1)_q , [ chain ] where we will consider two possibilities for @xmath33 . + as model - i @xmath34(g_{2l } \\neq g_{2r})$ ] is realized by breaking the gut - symmetry and by assigning vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to the d - parity odd singlet in @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "as the left - right discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken at the gut scale , the higgs sector becomes asymmetric below @xmath36 causing inequality between the gauge couplings @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this model does not have the cosmological domain wall problem .",
    "the second step of symmetry breaking takes place by the right - handed ( rh ) higgs triplet @xmath39 whereas the third step of breaking to sm takes place by the @xmath31-submultiplet @xmath40 contained in the rh doublet of @xmath41 .",
    "it is well known that sm breaks to low energy symmetry by the sm higgs doublet contained in the bidoublet @xmath42 under @xmath32 which originates from @xmath43 of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the minimal particle content for the model to carry out the spontaneous braking of gut symmetry to low - energy theory .",
    "but a major objective of the present work is to explore the possibility of observable nonunitarity effects for which it is required to extract information on the dirac neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath44 ) from a fit to the fermion masses at the gut scale and this is possible by including two higgs doublets instead of one @xcite .",
    "we assume these doublets to originate from two separate bidoublets contained in @xmath45 .",
    "implementation of inverse seesaw also requires the minimal extension by adding three @xmath0-singlet fermions @xmath46 , one for each generation @xcite .    as model - ii",
    ", we treat the gut symmetry to be broken by the vev of the @xmath32-singlet @xmath47 which is even under d - parity @xcite .",
    "this causes the higgs sector below gut - scale to be left - right symmetric resulting in equal gauge couplings in @xmath48 . for the sake of simplicity we treat the rest of the symmetry breaking patterns of model - ii similar to model - i and we assume the presence of three singlet fermions .",
    "we call these two models , model - i and model - ii , as minimal models with two low scale higgs doublets in each .",
    "we now examine precision gauge coupling unification for these two models .",
