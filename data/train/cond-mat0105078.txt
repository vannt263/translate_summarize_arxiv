    "in the chromatin a long negative dna double helix winds around a positive histone octamer to form a complex known as the nucleosome@xcite . presumably due to their coulomb repulsion nucleosomes position themselves equidistantly along the dna helix , forming a periodic necklace or a beads - on - a - string structure , which is also called a 10 nm fiber .",
    "the fact that the self assembly of this structure is very sensitive to the salt concentration shows that electrostatic forces are important . in proper conditions ,",
    "the 10 nm fiber self assembles ( condenses ) into the 30 nm chromatin fiber , which is the major building material of a chromosome@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to understand whether electrostatic forces alone are sufficient to form the 10 nm fiber and determine the range of its stability .",
    "this is one of the motivations to study theoretically and experimentally a model of  artificial chromatin \" , where histone octamers ( which themselves are in a complex equilibrium with a population of individual histones ) are replaced by identical positive hard spheres ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bead ] ) . in experimental realizations of  artificial chromatin \" , spheres can be colloidal particles@xcite , micelles@xcite or dendrimers@xcite .",
    "other motivations are related to many applications of such complexes .",
    "one of them is the gene therapy .",
    "inversion of charge of dna by its complexation with positive spheres should facilitate its contact with a usually negative cell membrane making penetration into the cell more likely .",
    "another application we want to mention here is the possibility of making dna guided nanowires@xcite by complexation of metallic spherical colloids with dna .",
    "when dna is replaced by synthetic polyelectrolyte ( pe ) , other industrial applications emerge from pharmaceutics to protein extraction and purification .    in the previous paper@xcite we analytically considered a worm - like negative pe ( dna ) with the total charge @xmath0 and uniformly charged positive spheres with charge @xmath1 .",
    "( below we use the word dna instead of pe postponing generalizations to the end of the paper ) .",
    "we studied their complexation in a water solution containing a concentration @xmath2 of dna molecules and a concentration @xmath3 of spheres together with their monovalent counterions and a finite concentration of monovalent salt which provides debye - hckel screening with the screening radius @xmath4 . in the ref .",
    "we dealt only with large enough concentrations @xmath3 , neglecting entropy of free spheres .",
    "we have shown that , at large @xmath3 , the state of the system is determined by the ratio @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is isoelectric concentration at which the total charge of dna is equal to the total charge of spheres . at @xmath7 dna winding around a sphere overscreens it so that the net charge of the sphere becomes negative .",
    "negative spheres repel each other and form a periodic necklace . in the opposite case @xmath8 ,",
    "more spheres bind to dna than necessary to neutralize it , thus inverting the charge of dna .",
    "the origin of this counterintuitive phenomenon of charge inversion is the correlation induced attraction of a new sphere to a neutral complex : a new sphere approaching a neutral complex pushes away neighboring spheres , unwinds some of dna from them and winds it on itself .",
    "in other words , a new sphere creates an oppositely charged image in the complex and binds to it .",
    "it is this additional attraction which leads to charge inversion . in this case , the net charge of each sphere is positive .",
    "positive spheres repel each other and also form a periodic necklace .",
    "far from the isoelectric point , @xmath9 , complexes have a beads - on - a - string structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bead ] ) .",
    "they are strongly charged and repel each other in the solution , so that solution is stable . at the isoelectric point , @xmath9 , the sphere net charge and the charge of the whole complex simultaneously cross zero . in the narrow vicinity of the isoelectric point , the charges of complexes ( and their coulomb repulsion ) are so small that their short range attraction between complexes due to correlations of solenoids of dna on different spheres ( see fig . [ fig:2spheres ] ) is able to condense them .",
    "complexes form large and weakly charged bundles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bundle ] )    = 7.0 cm    = 5.0 cm    at a given concentration @xmath2 of dna and growing concentration @xmath3 of spheres , dna molecules experience condensation ( aggregation ) at some critical concentration @xmath10 below the isoelectric point @xmath11 , and remain in condensed state until another concentration @xmath12 above the isoelectric point , where the inverted positive charge of the complex becomes so large that condensate dissolves .",
    "the electrophoretic mobility changes sign at the isoelectric point @xmath11 located between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "inversion of sign of electrophoretic mobility of complexes of dna with dendrimers was recently reported in ref . .    in ref . , we dealt only with large @xmath3 and concentrated mainly on the structure and charge of free necklaces far from the condensation domain . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the dependence of the critical concentrations @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 plane and study details of the condensation domain .",
    "our main result is shown by the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] . in this diagram ,",
    "an aggregate of dna - spheres complexes exists only in the region surrounded by the lines @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( the two solid lines ) .",
    "the domain of large enough concentrations @xmath3 , studied ref .",
    "is shown by gray . in the gray area condensation domain",
    "is narrow and encloses isoelectric line @xmath18 .",
    "we call this part of phase diagram the  neck \" . at smaller @xmath3 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the condensation region is found to be much wider so that we call it the  body \" .",
    "the dash line corresponds to the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 at which complexes are neutral .",
    "notice that , in agreement with result of ref .",
    ", this line is essentially the isoelectric line for the  neck \" , but it is high above the isoelectric line for the  body \" , where substantial fraction of spheres is free .",
    "the same diagram is shown in linear scale on fig .",
    "[ fig : lphase ] . at large @xmath3 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the phase diagram is extremely simple and centered around the isoelectric line .",
    "when we zoom at smaller @xmath3 and @xmath2 , symmetry with respect to the isoelectric line disappears and we see the fine structure of the condensation domain .",
    "there are two light gray regions next to lines @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where condensate coexists with free necklaces . between them",
    "there is the dark gray region were practically all dna and spheres are consumed by the condensate and concentration of free necklaces is exponentially small .",
    "we also study the change in the fraction of free necklaces and their charge when we cross all these regions , for example , by increasing @xmath3 , while keeping @xmath2 constant ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fraction ] below ) .",
    "one of interesting results is that the inversion of the necklace charge happens in a relatively narrow range of @xmath3 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : phase ] and [ fig : lphase ] we did not try to show that the lines @xmath13 and @xmath14 should merge at extremely small @xmath2 , where translational entropy of dna molecules becomes important and as a result dna complexes dissolve .",
    "these lines may also merge again when @xmath3 and @xmath2 are so large that the fraction of water in the mixture is significantly reduced .",
    "then our phase diagram can also be redrawn as a close loop ternary miscibility diagram .",
    "bundles of complexes formed in the gray area of phase diagram of fig .",
    "5 are almost neutral in the sense that their charge is proportional not to the number of aggregated complexes or volume of the bundle , but to the linear size or surface area of bundle .",
    "the sign of the charge is however same as for free complexes .",
    "it flips on the neutrality line where charge inversion takes place for free complexes .    to derive these phase diagrams , we use two phenomenological parameters . the first one , @xmath19 , is the binding energy per sphere of the dna - spheres complex ( necklace ) in the aggregate .",
    "the second one , @xmath20 , is the concentration of spheres , which is in equilibrium with neutral dna - spheres complexes .",
    "this concentration separates domains of positive and negative complexes at @xmath21 .",
    "these two phenomenological parameters can be extracted from the experimental phase diagram .",
    "they can also be calculated from microscopic theory . in this paper",
    "we present comprehensive microscopic theory of these parameters and study the influence of salt on their value .",
    "we show below that , generally speaking , screening by salt increases the width of the neck and , at strong screening , increases @xmath20 so that the  body \" grows at the expense of the  neck \" .",
    "it is known that the onsager - manning condensation of monovalent counterions  @xcite renormalizes linear charge density of free dna helix from the bare value @xmath22 to critical onsager - manning density @xmath23 .",
    "thus one can ask which of the two one should use to calculate charge of dna molecule , @xmath24 , and the isoelectric point @xmath25 .",
    "we show that , because of the positive charge of the spheres surface , some dna counterions are released into solution . as a result",
    ", the absolute value of the effective net linear density , @xmath26 , of dna ( which almost neutralizes a sphere ) decreases with decreasing screening length @xmath4 from the bare density @xmath27 to the onsager - manning critical density @xmath28 according to the formula : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the distance between dna turns on the surface of a sphere if @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the radius of a dna helix ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bead ] ) .",
    "one can show that @xmath31 if @xmath33 .",
    "it is the net charge density @xmath26 of dna which defines a renormalized isoelectric concentration @xmath34 .",
    "thus , when @xmath4 decreases , the phase diagram moves down together with @xmath35 as shown in fig .",

    "other applications are discussed in sec .",
    ", we would like to mention only the well known phenomenon of reentrant condensation of double - helix dna in solutions with small size multivalent counterions with charge @xmath36 ( @xmath37-ions ) , such as spermine , a short positive pe with @xmath38 . at some critical concentration of @xmath37-ions",

    "a theory of reentrant condensation of dna by spermine was given in ref . .",
    "it is also based upon two phenomenological parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which have meaning of the binding energy of dna per @xmath37-ion in the aggregate and the concentration of @xmath37-ions which is in equilibrium with neutralized - by-@xmath37-ions dna . by comparison of @xmath39 and @xmath40 with theory ,",
    "they were found to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 mm .",
    ", however , dealt only with very small @xmath2 .",
    "the phenomenological theory of this paper extends the theory of the spermine induced reentrant condensation to the whole plane @xmath45 .",
    "although dna - spheres complexes and dna with spermine have the same phase diagram , there are important quantitative differences between them .",
    "this is because , as we will see in the next section , the concentration @xmath20 decreases exponentially with the binding energy of a @xmath37-ion or a sphere with dna . for large strongly charged spheres , the binding energy of a sphere with wrapping dna",

    "the dna - spheres complex is always charged and , therefore , has an extended shape to minimize its coulomb self - energy . at a length scale larger than the average distance @xmath50 between the spheres along the complex , the complex can be considered as a charged cylinder with length @xmath51 , radius @xmath50 ( see fig .",

    "then the capacitance @xmath53 of the complex is : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the dielectric constant of water and monovalent salt in solution is treated in the debye - hckel approximation with screening length @xmath4 .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ eq : fone ] ) is the standard self - energy of a complex with net charge @xmath56 and capacitance @xmath53 .",
    "the second term is the correlation energy , which accounts for the discreteness of the spheres charge at the length scale smaller than @xmath50 ( in the beads - on - a - string structure , it is essentially the interaction of a sphere with the dna coil wound around it ) .",
    "the correlation energy per sphere @xmath57 is negative and , in general , it is to be calculated from microscopic theory . in this section , it is assumed to be known and is used as an input parameter of the theory .",

    "[ fig:2spheres ] ) and the energy @xmath19 is very small . in the case of dna with spermine , @xmath37-ions so strongly screen dna that attraction is developed only in the small area where two dna touch and the energy @xmath19 is relatively small .    between systems of dna with large spheres and dna with spermine",
    "there are many others with intermediate size and charge of spheres .",
    "one can easily imagine an intermediate system , where on one side spheres are not large and strongly charged enough that dna behaves as a flexible pe , and on the other side they are strongly enough charged so that they form something like one - dimensional wigner crystal on its surface .",
    "in such a case , mutual screening of dna and spheres is not as complete as in the case of dna with large spheres or with spermine ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : semiflexible ] or ref . ) .",
    "therefore , inequality @xmath221 can be violated and reentrant condensation may not materialize .",
    "let us give an example of a different , well - studied system where this happens .",
    "consider a solution cationic lipid membranes and long double helix dna .",
    "each membrane , in principle , may complex with many dna rods which lie on it equidistantly parallel to each other , forming a kind of one - dimensional wigner crystal .",
    "( in such a complex dna plays the role of @xmath37-ion ) these complexes may be undercharged and overcharged .",
    "they can also condense in three - dimensional aggregates , where layers of equidistantly positioned parallel dna rods alternate with membranes  @xcite .",
    "such aggregates have potential applications in gene therapy as non - viral gene carriers . in spite of liquid nature of membranes , which permits",
    "some redistribution of lipid charge inside membrane to screen dna , attraction between different complexes in this crystal is so strong that situation for a reentrant transition in this case is marginal ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "it seems from experimental data that indeed aggregates exist even far from the isoelectric point  @xcite .    for the colloidal spheres covered by short dna mentioned in sec .",
    "v , binding is related to the small area of contact and energy @xmath19 is small again .",
    "let us , instead of short dna , consider small positive colloidal particles .",
    "if their size and charge are much smaller than that of larger negative ones we still get reentrant condensation like with the short dna . but what happens when their charges and sizes become comparable is not obvious .",
    "therefore it is interesting to consider a simpler case of a solution of positive and negative spherical macroions with same absolute values of charges , @xmath1 , same radius , @xmath144 and with concentrations @xmath223 and @xmath224 respectively .",
    "let us talk about large enough @xmath223 and @xmath224 , when coulomb energy of interaction of two touching spheres , @xmath225 , completely dominates the entropy .",
    "it is obvious then that at @xmath226 such system tends to self assemble into nacl - like crystal and gain the madelung energy @xmath227 per negative sphere .",
    "away from the isoelectric point situation is less trivial .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a solution with @xmath228 ( neutrality is provided by monovalent negative ions )",
    ". in this case one has to compare energies of two states .",
    "the first one consist of nacl - like crystal consuming concentrations @xmath224 of both positive and negative spheres .",
    "the rest @xmath224 positive spheres are free .",
    "such state has the energy @xmath229 per unit volume of solution .",
    "the second state consists only of @xmath224 triplets , in which two positive spheres are attached on opposite sides to a negative one .",
    "energy of such a complex is @xmath230 .",
    "we see that second state looses to the first .",
    "it can be shown that at any @xmath231 , the largest possible fraction of spheres always self assembles in neutral nacl - like crystal .",
    "thus we are coming to conclusion that triplets ( which are positive at @xmath232 and negative at @xmath233 ) do not form .",
    "triplets can be considered as analogs of free and charged dna - spheres necklaces .",
    "so in this case , neutral condensed state always dominates and there is no reentrant condensation at all .",
    "in this paper , we presented a phenomenological theory of reentrant condensation .",
    "the theory is applicable not only to the solution of dna and spheres but also to a much broader range of systems .    here",
    ", we would like to discuss possible implications of our theory for the natural chromatin assuming that the beads - on - a - string structure of 10 nm chromatin fiber is indeed determined by electrostatic interactions . in this case",
    ", the finite distance between nucleosomes tells us that the whole 10 nm fiber is charged .",
    "electrophoretic experiments@xcite show that in low salt conditions , the net charge of 10 nm fiber is negative .",
    "( by the net charge we mean bare charges of dna and histones plus charges which are onsager - manning condensed on them and , therefore , are bound to the fiber with the energy larger than @xmath208 ) .",
    "an additional argument for the negative sign of the charge is that the increasing salt concentration condenses it into the 30 nm fiber .",
    "this means that 10 nm fiber obeys the scenario discussed in sec .",
    "v for the point 1 of fig .",
    "[ fig : twophase ] .    looking at the phase diagram of fig . [",
    "fig : twophase ] we can ask whether one can increase concentrations of both octamers and salt much further so that that the point ( @xmath234 ) becomes higher than the decondensation curve @xmath14 and instead of 30 nm fiber or higher order structures we can get a _",
    "positive _ stable 10 nm fiber .",
    "this is not easy because free octamers decay into smaller histone dimers or tetramers . to keep equilibrium concentration of free octamers @xmath3 in solution at the necessary level",
    ", concentrations of histones should be large . in spite of this difficulty we suggest to try to create and study a positive 10 nm fiber .",
