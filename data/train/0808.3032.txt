    "hence , inter - valley scattering is the only reflection mechanism .",
    "however , since momentum transfer @xmath106 is quite large , @xmath107 is very small ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "so if we neglect the inter - valley scattering probability@xcite , then monolayer graphene can be regarded as a condensed matter version klein paradox@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the transmission amplitude shows a resonant feature that the envelope of @xmath109 deceases monotonically as @xmath110 increases .",

    "[ fig : monolayer ] . at first",
    ", it is worth noting that pseudo - spin is a good quantum number in normally incident tunneling and the incident electrons might have two types of pseudo - spin , @xmath119 or @xmath120 . for low potential barrier , i.e. @xmath121 , there are four propagating states in region slowromancap3@. two of these states have pseudo - spin @xmath77 , while the other two have pseudo - spin @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , no matter which incident state we select , the pseudo - spin inside the barrier can always match the incoming quasiparticle .",
    "so in low - barrier limit , resonant pattern is found in the transmission amplitude of both valleys .    on the other hand , for high potential barrier ,",
    "i.e. @xmath122 , two propagating states with pseudo - spin @xmath79 in region slowromancap3@ turn to evanescent states@xcite , while the propagating states with pseudo - spin @xmath77 remain the same . as a result ,",
    "different incident electrons come from different dirac points @xmath104 and @xmath116 must have distinct transmission properties . for incident electron in state @xmath44 with pseudo - spin @xmath77 ,",
    "the potential barrier is always transparent . on the contrary , for electron coming from state @xmath45 with pseudo - spin @xmath79",
    ", it can not penetrate the potential barrier if @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , it is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mononormalhigh ] that the possibility of inter - valley scattering can be notably enhanced if we increase the potential height @xmath110 . using these tunneling properties ,",
    "one may obtain valley polarized electron currents@xcite in monolayer graphene by adding appropriate external gate voltage .",
    "similar to low - barrier limit , we find that the magnitude of inter - valley scattering amplitude also depends very sensitively on potential height @xmath110 and the thickness of region slowromancap2@ , slowromancap4@ in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] . if we smooth the potential step by increasing @xmath112 , then the envelope of inter - valley scattering coefficient shrinks much smaller very quickly . furthermore ,",
    "although inter - valley scattering requires a very large momentum transfer , we can still achieve very high scattering probability by increasing the barrier height .",
    "our result shows that charge carriers in monolayer graphene , when subjected to a high potential barrier , exhibit totally distinct tunneling features from dirac fermions .    for the case of bilayer graphene ,",
    "the computational results are shown in the following figures .",
    "some representatives @xmath72 dependence are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : biky ] , and these should be contrasted to the case of monolayer in fig .",
    "[ fig : monoky ] .",
    "the result is totally different since the bilayer energy spectrum(see fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] ) splits into two bands .",

    "this behavior , which is similar to the tunneling property of non - chiral massive quasiparticles , is in obvious contrast to monolayer graphene , where massless dirac fermions are always perfectly transmitted for small @xmath72@xcite .",
    "@xmath118{bi - normal - k+.eps}}\\\\      \\resizebox{80mm}{!}{\\includegraphics[]{bi - normal - k-.eps } } \\end{array}$ ]    to understand this feature , let s take a look at the result of normally incident case as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binormal ] .",
    "one can see in this figure that the transmission probability @xmath123 if @xmath124 and the transmission amplitudes exhibit nonresonant feature within this range .",
    "this result is valley independent and can be explained in terms of pseudo - spin conservation in normal incident tunneling .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] , under the condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) , all the propagating states in region slowromancap3@ are hole states @xmath97 with pseudo - spin @xmath79 . while the incoming wave , no matter which valley it comes from , must have pseudo - spin @xmath77 . as a result ,",
    "the only survival tunneling mechanism is via evanescent hole states @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , @xmath125 becomes a non - penetrative region for bilayer graphene .",
    "this conclusion is coincide with the @xmath72 dependence as we depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : biky ] .",
    "on the other hand , beyond this non - penetrative range , the resonant feature is found again for all barrier heights as the pseudo - spin of propagating states in region slowromancap3@ can always match the incoming electron .",
    "further more , valley difference is not obvious in low energy limit when @xmath126 , which is the same as the case in monolayer graphene under low - barrier limit . while for high barrier tunneling , the transmission patterns of different dirac points are notably distinct .",
    "this distinction is due to the inter - valley momentum transfer @xmath127 is larger than @xmath128 so intrinsically the probability of inter - valley scattering amplitudes @xmath129 should smaller than @xmath130 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : binormal ] , this difference is amplified by high potential barrier and shows the existence of valley polarized current in bilayer graphene@xcite .",
    "moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig : binormal ] , the patterns of reflection coefficient @xmath131 are almost the same .",
    "this can be understood as intra - valley momentum transfer in two valleys are equal to each other @xmath132    finally , we also point out that the dependence of transmission amplitude on @xmath112 and @xmath111 in bilayer graphene is the same as the result in monolayer structure .",
    "if we increase the width of region slowromancap3@ , the envelope of @xmath109 curve does not change while the period of resonant oscillation decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "if we smooth the potential step by broadening the width of region slowromancap2@ and slowromancap4@ , the amplitude of inter - valley scattering falls very quickly to smaller than @xmath114 .",
    "however , intra - valley scattering probability does not depend on @xmath112 in our computation .",
    "thus we can tune the proportion of these two scattering mechanisms separately by adding arbitrary electronic fields at the edges of the external potential barrier .    before closing ,",
    "just a comment on our calculation .",
    "actually , previous studies of tunneling properties in monolayer ( bilayer ) graphene that were based on a continuum model have used a massless dirac fermion ( massive excitations ) approximation , which is expected to be accurate for low - energy quasiparticles@xcite .",
    "hence , inter - valley scattering is rarely considered in investigating the transport properties of graphene systems@xcite because of the large separation of dirac points in momentum space .",
    "moreover , valley contrasting physics is also absent in low - energy quasiparticle s tunneling features in this system .",
    "however , our result shows that , although low - energy tunneling in monolayer ( bilayer ) graphene is sufficiently described by massless ( massive ) fermion approximation , in high - energy limit there will be a significant deviation between this approximation and the real system@xcite . with the increasing of barrier height , inter - valley scattering can be realized and amplified significantly as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mononormalhigh ] and [ fig : binormal ] . at the same time",
    ", we find that valley discrepancy in the tunneling problem would be gradually magnified by strengthening the external potential .",
    "these effects , which are distinct from the properties of low - energy limit , lead to the possibility of generating , detecting and controlling valley polarized currents in graphene systems by electric means@xcite .",

    "our result illustrates that the tunneling behavior in graphene is much richer than what was anticipated in massless dirac fermion approximation .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that both of the intra- and inter - valley scattering probability are strongly dependent on the applied external potential , forming the basis for the valley - based electronics applications of these systems .",
