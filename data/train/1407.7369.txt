    "collisional ring galaxies are scarce , yet very interesting objects .",
    "their most prominent feature is the lack of a typical spiral structure , replaced by a narrow , ring  shaped accumulation of gas and stars .",
    "such a peculiar distribution of matter is believed to form during collision of a spiral , gas  rich galaxy with a small , early type one ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy pair consisting of ngc2444 and 2445 is one of the few systems of ring galaxies that have been included in the arp s catalogue , denoted arp143 @xcite .",
    "however , it differs significantly from the usual image of a ring system , as the ring structure in ngc2445 is distorted , similar in appearance to a trapezoid with rounded vertices .",
    "the whole visible structure is dominated by local maxima of optical emission that are regions of intensive star formation @xcite .",
    "all of them are relatively young , and the central region is suspected to be undergoing starburst activity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pair is known to be `` traling smoke '' , as the hi morphology @xcite reveals a 150kpc long tail of the neutral gas emission extending towards north .",
    "all this is suggestive for a collision of ngc2445 with a compact galaxy  possibly its companion , ngc2444 @xcite .",
    "this collision disrupted the spiral disk and resulted in morphological distortions as well as in intensification of the star formation in particular regions of the collisional ring .",
    "+ not much is known about the radio emission from arp143 .",
    "in fact , the only work that aimed at revealing the morphology of the radio - emitting medium of this object was that of @xcite , who used the westerbork synthesis radio telescope to study several interacting galaxies .",
    "these authors identified a source of radio emission within ngc2445 , associating it with one of the hii regions .",
    "however , they excluded the possibility of a purely thermal origin of the emission , as the luminosity was far too high to be caused by thermal processes only .",
    "apart from that paper , the only available radio data was that from large surveys ( e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite mention a study of arp143 ( as well as of ten other ring systems ) made with the very large array ( vla ) at the frequency of 8440mhz , but no detailed information is provided . using arp10 as an example",
    ", these authors suggest that the spectral index of the emission from ring galaxies might steepen inwards from the ring",
    ". such phenomenon could be a result of a change from thermal to non - thermal emission and/or of ageing of the highest energy electrons , which leads to their absence in the inner region of the ring .",
    "however , almost nothing is known about the magnetic field and its properties . also , cross  identifications between radio - emitting structures and their counterparts in other domains of the electromagnetic spectrum have not yet been made .",
    "+ in this paper we present results from our recent observing project at the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , in which arp143 has been studied at 234 and 612mhz .",
    "the new observations are analysed together with the previously unpublished , archive vla data at 1490 , 4860 , 8440 , and 14940mhz to produce high resolution maps of the radio emission and to study the magnetic field of this galaxy pair .",
    "the gmrt near pune , india was used to observe arp143 at 234 and 612mhz . the observations were carried out in a dual frequency mode as a part of our project `` magnetic field and galaxy interactions  from loose groups to mergers '' ( project code 23_025 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out in february , 2013 .",
    "the total observing time was 8h and the bandwidths were 16 and 32mhz at 234 and 612mhz , respectively .",
    "the ( u , v ) data were reduced using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) , including calibration and rfi  flagging . after obtaining initial images at both frequencies ,",
    "they were processed by a self - calibration pipeline in order to correct the phase information .",
    "the final images have been ( u , v)-tapered to obtain circular beams and then corrected for the primary beam shape .",
    "two images have been made : one with resolution of 16arcsec at 234mhz , and another at 612mhz , with resolution of 10arcsec .",
    "original beam sizes and noise levels of these maps can be found in table  [ beamsizes ] .    [",
    "cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      as mentioned in sect",
    ".  [ intro ] , the collisional ring of ngc2445 is far from being circular / elliptical . so is the radio emission distribution in this galaxy : its se side is less prominent than the nw one ( not only in the radio regime ) .",
    "the emission is weaker  not only at 234mhz ( fig .",
    "[ pband ] ) , but also in better quality maps at 612 ( fig .",
    "[ gband ] ) and 4860mhz ( fig .",
    "[ cband ] ) .",
    "star - forming regions in the se part have also somewhat weaker magnetic fields and are less extended .",
    "additionally , the angular distance from the core to the ring is lower in the nw part than in the se part .",
    "the asymmetry may result from an ongoing interaction with ngc2444 , resulting in the compression of the nw part of the ring , which leads to the amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "such interaction has been suggested multiple times ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of the radio - emitting medium is very similar to that of the molecular emission ( @xcite ) , including lack of the pah radio emission in the southernmost knot ( labeled _ d _ in @xcite ) and weak emission in the northernmost knot ( _ g _ in @xcite ) .",
    "both these knots have the lowest far - uv star - forming rates .",
    "this suggests that the radio emission deficiency might be result of faster cr diffusion when compared to the synchrtotron losses .",
    "weaker magnetic field  especially in the southern part  allows cr electrons to dffuse regardless of their energy .    in general",
    ", the overall radio distribution seems to confirm the scenario of an off - axis collision and later , on - going interaction with ngc2444 .",
    "the radio ring follows the distribution of the neutral and ionised gas ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which is suspected to have formed as a result of such collision .",
    "the asymmetry of the emission together with the intergalactic ridge provides an evidence of an interaction with the companion galaxy .",
    "however , further details of the interaction history would need examination of the regular magnetic field properties , i.e. analysis of the polarisation data ( like that was done for ngc3627 by @xcite , or the virgo cluster spirals , by @xcite ) ,",
    "we observed the tight galaxy pair arp143 with the gmrt at 234 and 612mhz .",
    "radio emission maps were analysed together with the archive vla data at 1490 , 4860 , 8440 , and 14940mhz to study the spectral age of the features seen in the system , morphology of the radio emitting medium and the magnetic field strength and energy within the pair .",
    "the results obtained are summarised below : +  the radio emission from ngc2445 concentrates in the northwestern part of the optical ring , extending to the outer parts of ngc2444 .",
    "several distinct radio emitting regions can be identified : the core , three star - forming regions , and an intergalactic ridge . +  the galactic core is a not very compact ( 0.8 on 0.5kpc ) , synchrotron  emitting source .",
    "it possesses a strong magnetic field of @xmath2 g .",
    "it has a relatively flat spectrum ( @xmath3 ) and the age estimate yields @xmath4myrs ( depending on the model fitted ) .",
    "this is consistent with its identification as a starburst region .",
    "+  the northwestern region of radio emission , coincident with the star  forming knots , possesses magnetic field with strength of @xmath5 g  somewhat stronger than the typical galactic fields .",
    "its spectrum is typical for an ageing , yet not very old electron population , with a mean spectral index of 0.81 @xmath6 0.07 .",
    "the spectral age estimate of @xmath7myrs is higher than that of the star - forming knots given by @xcite , indicating that most of the radio emission is associated with an older electron population , that was injected while a density wave was propagating through the intergalactic medium .",
    "+  two other  southern and eastern  regions of star - formation have been detected .",
    "their magnetic fields ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 g , respectively ) are somewhat weaker than that of the northwestern one .",
    "+  distribution of the radio emission from ngc2445 shows significant asymmetry , with the northwestern part being more luminous than the southeastern one .",
    "this supports the scenario of an ongoing interaction with ngc2444 . + ",
    "ngc2444 is in general a non - radio - emitting galaxy , apart from the intergalactic radio ridge connecting it with ngc2445 .",
    "the magnetic field in the ridge is comparable to those found in the star - forming regions .",
    "it is also similar to that found in the intergalactic bridge of the taffy galaxies @xcite .",
    "+  there are no signs of radio emission from the hi tail reported by @xcite .",
    "depending on the  yet unknown  depth of the radio emitting medium , the upper limit for the magnetic field in the tidal tail is @xmath10 g , yielding @xmath11 for its energy density .",
