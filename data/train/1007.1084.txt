    "the combination of concepts and methods , developed in different branches of physics , has always led to new insights and improvements . in nuclear physics for example ,",
    "the description of rotational and vibrational nuclear spectra has undoubtedly been influenced by concepts , which were first developed for molecular spectra .",
    "the intention of this paper is similar .",
    "we will show , that the concept of q - deformed lie algebras and the methods developed in fractional calculus are closely related and may be combined leading to a new class of fractional q - deformed lie algebras .",
    "an interesting question of physical relevance is whether q - deformed lie algebras are not only suitable for describing small deviations from lie symmetries , but in addition can bridge different lie symmetries @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that fractional q - deformed lie algebras show exactly this behaviour .",
    "for that purpose , we will first introduce the necessary tools for a fractional extension of the usual q - deformed lie algebras and present the fractional analogue of the standard q - deformed oscillator .    as an application we will use the fractional q - deformed oscillator for a description of the low energy excitation ground state band spectra of even - even nuclei . in addition ,",
    "the equivalence of rotational and vibrational spectra for the fractional q - deformed lie algebras is demonstrated and the @xmath0 values for the fractional q - deformed symmetric rotor are discussed .",
    "finally we present a first application of half integer representations of the fractional rotation group @xmath2 in terms of a successful interpretation of the @xmath1 band spectrum of the nucleus @xmath3w@xmath4 .",
    "q - deformed lie algebras are extended versions of the usual lie algebras @xcite .",
    "they provide us with an extended set of symmetries and therefore allow the description of physical phenomena , which are beyond the scope of usual lie algebras . in order to describe a q - deformed lie algebra",

    "during the last years the interest of physicists in non - local field theories has been steadily increasing .",
    "the main reason for this development is the expectation , that the use of these field theories will lead to a much more elegant and effective way of treating problems in particle and high - energy physics , as it has been possible up to now with local field theories .",
    "a particular subgroup of non - local field theories is described with operators of fractional nature and is specified within the framework of fractional calculus .",
    "fractional calculus @xcite-@xcite provides us with a set of axioms and methods to extend the concept of a derivative operator from integer order @xmath25 to arbitrary order @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is a real value : @xmath27 despite the fact , that this concept has been discussed since the days of leibniz and since then has occupied the great mathematicians of their times , no other research area has resisted a direct application for centuries .",
    "consequently , abel s treatment of the tautochrone problem from 1823 @xcite stood for a long time as a singular example for an application of fractional calculus .",
    "not until the works of mandelbrot on fractal geometry @xcite in the early 1980 s the interest of physicists has been attracted by this subject and caused a first wave of publications in the area of fractional brownian motion and anomalous diffusion processes .",
    "but these works caused only minimal impact on the progress of traditional physics , because the results obtained could also be derived using classical methods @xcite .",
    "this situation changed drastically by the progress made in the area of fractional wave equations during the last 10 years . within this process",
    ", new questions in fundamental physics have been raised , which can not be formulated adequately using traditional methods .",
    "consequently a new research area has emerged , which allows for new insights und intriguing results using new methods and approaches .",
    "the interest in fractional wave equations was reinforced in the year 2000 with a publication of raspini @xcite .",
    "he demonstrated , that a 3-fold factorization of the klein - gordon equation leads to a fractional dirac equation which contains fractional derivative operators of order @xmath28 and furthermore the resulting @xmath29 - matrices obey an extended clifford algebra . to state",
    "this result more precisely : the extension of dirac s linearization procedure which determines the correct coupling of a su(2 ) symmetric charge to a 3-fold factorization of the dalembert - operator leads to a fractional wave equation with an inherent su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is formally deduced by the factorization procedure .",
    "in contrast to this formal derivation a standard yang - mills - theory is merely a recipe for coupling a phenomenologically deduced su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "zavada @xcite has generalized raspini s result : he demonstrated , that a n - fold factorization of the dalembert - operator automatically leads to fractional wave equations with an inherent su(n ) symmetry .    in 2002",
    "laskin @xcite on the basis of the riesz definition @xcite of the fractional derivative presented a schrdinger equation with fractional derivatives and gave a proof of hermiticity and parity conservation of this equation . in 2005",
    "we @xcite calculated algebraically the casimir operators and multiplets of the fractional extension of the standard rotation group so(n ) .",
    "this may be interpreted as a first approach to investigate a fractional generalization of a standard lie - algebra .",
    "the classification scheme derived was used for a successful description of the charmonium spectrum .",
    "the derived symmetry has been used to predict the exact masses of y(4260 ) and x(4664 ) , which later have been confirmed experimentally . in the year",
    "2006 goldfain @xcite demonstrated , that the low level fractional dynamics @xcite on a flat minkowski metric most probably describes similar phenomena as a field theory in curved riemann space time .",
    "in addition , he proposed a successful mechanism to quantize fractional free fields . in 2006",
    "lim @xcite proposed a quantization description for free fractional fields of klein - gordon - type and investigated the temperature dependence of those fields .    in 2007",
    "we @xcite applied the concept of local gauge invariance to fractional free fields and derived the exact interaction form in first order of the coupling constant .",
    "the fractional analogue of the normal zeeman - effect was calculated and as a first application a mass formula was presented , which gives the masses of the baryon spectrum with an accuracy better than 1@xmath30 .",
    "it has been demonstrated , that the concept of local gauge invariance determines the exact form of interaction , which in lowest order coincides with the derived group chain for the fractional rotation group .",
    "furthermore we investigated the transformation properties of the fractional schrdinger equation under rotations with the result , that the particles described carry an additional intrinsic mixed rotational- and translational degree of freedom , which we named fractional spin .",
    "as a consequence the transformation properties of a fractional schrdinger equation are closely related to a standard pauli equation . since then the investigation of the fractional rotation group within the framework of fractional group theory has lead to a vast amount of interestening results , e.g. a theoretical foundation of magic numbers in atomic nuclei @xcite and metallic clusters @xcite .    like q - deformed lie algebras",
    "the fractional rotation group extends the standard rotational symmetry and describes rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom simultaneously .",
    "there is a common aspect in the concepts of fractional calculus and q - deformed lie algebras : they both extend the definition of the standard derivative operator .",
    "therefore we will try to establish a connection between the q - derivative([qd ] ) and the fractional derivative definition .",
    "the definition of the fractional order derivative is not unique , several definitions e.g. the riemann , caputo , weyl , riesz , feller , grnwald fractional derivative definition coexist @xcite-@xcite .    but to be conformal with the requirements ( [ q00 ] ) and ( [ qdx ] ) , we may apply the caputo derivative @xmath31 : @xmath32 for a function set @xmath33 we obtain : @xmath34 let us now interpret the fractional derivative parameter @xmath26 as a deformation parameter in the sense of q - deformed lie algebras . setting @xmath35",
    "we define : @xmath36_\\alpha |n>= \\cases { { \\gamma(1+n \\alpha ) \\over \\gamma(1+(n-1)\\alpha ) } |n > &   $ n>0 $ \\cr \\\\ 0 &   $ n=0$\\cr}\\ ] ] indeed it follows @xmath37_\\alpha = n\\ ] ] the more or less abstract q - number is now interpreted within the mathematical context of fractional calculus as the fractional derivative parameter @xmath26 with a well understood meaning .",
    "the definition ( [ defa ] ) looks just like one more definition for a q - deformation .",
    "but there is a significant difference which makes the definition based on fractional calculus unique .",
    "standard q - numbers are defined more or less heuristically",
    ". there exists no physical or mathematical framework , which determines their explicit structure .",
    "consequently , many different definitions have been proposed in literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to this diversity , the q - deformation based on the definition of the fractional derivative is uniquely determined , once a set of basis functions is given .",
    "as an example we will derive the q - numbers for the fractional harmonic oscillator in the next section .",
    "in the following we will present a derivation of a fractional q - number , which is independent from the specific choice of a fractional derivative definition .    the transition from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics",
    "may be performed by canonical quantisation @xcite , @xcite . the classical canonically",
    "conjugated observables @xmath6 and @xmath38 are replaced by quantum mechanical observables @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are introduced as derivative operators on a hilbert space of square integrable wave functions @xmath41 , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "the commutation relations @xmath50 $ ] become @xmath26 dependent @xcite .",
    "of course , for @xmath51 these operators reduce to the standard @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    with these operators ,",

    "this yields the hamiltonian @xmath53 @xmath54 and the corresponding stationary schrdinger equation is explicitely given by : @xmath55 it should be emphasized , that the hermiticity of the proposed hamiltonian depends on the specific choice of a fractional derivative definition . while for the caputo- and riemann definition of the fractional derivative the resulting hamiltonian is not hermitean , it can be shown , that the use of the feller- and riesz definition of the fractional derivative assures hermiticity of the hamiltonian @xmath53 @xcite .    introducing the variable @xmath56 and",
    "the scaled energy @xmath57 : @xmath58 we obtain the stationary schrdinger equation for the fractional harmonic oscillator in the canonical form @xmath59 laskin @xcite has derived an approximate analytic solution within the framework of the wkb - approximation , which has the advantage , that it is independent of the choice of a specific definition of the fractional derivative .",
