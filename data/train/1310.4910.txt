    "the earliest studies of abundance inhomogeneities in globular clusters ( gcs ) centered around the behavior of absorption bands of cn and ch in the spectra of red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "stars occupying near - identical places in the color - magnitude diagram of a globular cluster can display very different strengths in the cn absorption bands at 3883   and 4215   and/or the 4300   g - band feature that is very sensitive to ch absorption ( zinn 1973a , b ; norris & zinn 1977 ; dickens et al .",

    "globular clusters of both the halo and disk / bulge populations show such phenomena .",
    "studies during the 1980 s revealed that abundance inhomogeneities within gcs extend to the elements o , na , and al ( e.g. , cohen 1978 ; peterson 1980 ; norris et al .",
    "1981 ; leep et al .",
    "1986 ) , and during the 1990 s the lick - texas group studied the anticorrelations between o and na in the northern globular clusters m15 , m92 , m3 , m13 , m5 and m71 ( sneden et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ; kraft et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ; shetrone 1996 ) .",
    "whereas early efforts concentrated on cn and ch , the use of 8 - 10 m class telescopes since the mid-1990 s has seen the emphasis in gc inhomogeneity studies shift to elements ranging in atomic number from o to al ( e.g. , kraft et al .",

    "one particular curiosity is that whereas the cn distribution within many gcs is bimodal ( e.g. , norris 1987 ; kayser et al .",
    "2008 ; smolinski et al .",
    "2011 ) the elements in the o - al range tend to show much more uniform spreads in abundance , as can be seen for example in figure 7 of the large study by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in general",
    ", the cn - strong stars in bimodal - cn gcs have been found to have enhanced na and al abundances and depleted o abundances relative to cn - weak stars ( some of the earliest studies of this trend include cottrell & da costa 1981 ; norris & smith 1983 ; norris & pilachowski 1985 ; lehnert et al .",
    "1991 ; brown & wallerstein 1992 ; and drake et al .",
    "1992 ) . however , the detailed relationships between the abundances of c and n , on one hand , and o , na and al , on the other , have been less well studied than the relationships among the o - al elements .",
    "one of the earliest globular clusters in which cn - enhanced red giants were identified is messier 5 ( osborn 1971 ; hesser et al .",
    "1977 ) based on ddo photometry . among rgb stars the cluster exhibits a bimodal @xmath03883 cn distribution ( smith & norris 1983 ) , but a fairly uniform dispersion in the abundances of o and na ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "there are a number of data sets in the literature on cn absorption as well as [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] abundances among evolved stars in messier 5 .",
    "these data are used in the present paper to document the relationship between cn band strengths and o and na abundances of rgb and agb stars in the cluster .",
    "this work builds on an earlier study of ivans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . a detailed investigation of na and o abundance trends among red horizontal branch stars in messier 5 has been published by gratton et al .",
    "in red giants of messier 5 the most prominent cn absorption band in the optical spectrum has a bandhead that is located near 3883  , although the 4215   cn band can also be discerned .",
    "consequently the sources of cn information that are used here comprise measurements of the strength of the @xmath03883 band .",
    "one of the earliest studies of cn inhomogeneities in m5 is that of zinn ( 1977 ) , who did not make quantitative measurements but rather classified the appearance of the @xmath03883 and @xmath04215 cn bands as either normal or strong based upon visual inspection of spectrograms obtained with the kpno 2.1 m telescope .",
    "his work revealed the presence of @xmath03883 cn inhomogeneities in messier 5 .",
    "spectroscopic indices that quantify the strength of the @xmath03883 cn band relative to nearby comparison regions of the spectrum have been compiled from the following sources : smith & norris ( 1983 , 1993 ) , briley et al .",

    "it is defined in the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the integrated flux or intensity in the spectrum of a red giant across the wavelength range 3846 - 3883   containing the cn absoption feature , while @xmath7 is the integrated flux or intensity in a comparison region 3883 - 3916   that is reasonably free of cn absorption .",
    "langer et al . ( 1985 ) presented two different @xmath03883 cn indices which they designated as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "of these it is their @xmath8 measurements that have been used here because this index is defined in a similar manner to @xmath4 , except that the cn feature and comparison wavelength ranges are 3850 - 3878   and 3896 - 3912 respectively .",
    "langer et al . ( 1992 ) measured an index denoted by them as @xmath10 that compared the @xmath03883 cn absorption in the wavelength range 3850 - 3885   to a combination of flux in the comparison intervals 3650 - 3780   and 4020 - 4130  .",
    "thus cn indices have been obtained from seven different literature sources .",
    "it is necessary to check for zero - point differences in the index systems of these various papers .",
    "we have sought to place the indices from other papers onto the system of smith & norris ( 1983 ; sn83 ) simply because of their larger sample .",

    "over much of the magnitude range of interest the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch are well separated in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of @xmath27 versus @xmath20 shown in figure 1 .",
    "there are 46 stars with @xmath4 index values in table 1 of which 10 are agb stars on the basis of their position in fig .",
    "1 . stars considered to be in the rgb and agb phases of evolution are shown as filled squares and open squares respectively .",
    "the classification of each star is listed in column 8 of table 1 .",
    "the behavior of the cn index @xmath4 versus @xmath27 is shown in figure 2 . at any given magnitude",
    "there is considerable scatter in cn index among the rgb stars , which are depicted with filled and open circles according to whether the @xmath03883 cn band is considered to be strong or weak respectively .",
    "as first noted in smith & norris ( 1983 ) the cn distribution on the red giant branch of messier 5 is bimodal , in fact , this cluster is one of the archetype examples of cn - bimodality among galactic globular clusters .",
    "there is one star in fig .",
    "2 that is represented by an eight - pointed symbol rather than a circle , this rgb star is iv-34 and may be an example of a red giant with intermediate cn band strength .",
    "in addition to the scatter at a given absolute magnitude , both the cn - weak and cn - strong stars exhibit a behavior of increasing mean @xmath4 with increasing luminosity on the rgb , which can be attributed at least in part to the sensitivity of the cn band strength to photospheric effective temperature . based on fig .  2 a reasonable lower envelope to the rgb - star data is one that passes through the points @xmath28 and ( 0.2 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "thus a suitable baseline in fig .",
    "2 above which most rgb stars fall has an equation @xmath30 .",
    "residuals @xmath31 were calculated relative to this baseline for all stars listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath32 index is an attempt to provide a measure of @xmath03883 cn band strength that has been compensated to at least first order for the differences in effective temperature among the rgb stars in the sample .",
    "this type of empirical correction has been used often in the literature going back to studies such as norris et al .",
    "values of @xmath32 are tabulated in column 5 of table 1 for both rgb and agb stars , although it must be stressed that the baseline used to produce these residuals is defined largely by rgb stars .",
    "asymptotic giant branch stars are plotted in fig .  2 as either triangles or three - pointed symbols .",
    "two agb stars ( filled triangles ) fall among the cn - strong rgb stars in fig .  2 , while one agb star ( open triangle ) sits among the cn - weak rgb stars . however , six of the agb stars have @xmath33 and are located at intermediate positions between the cn - weak and cn - strong rgb sequences in fig .",
    "an interpretation that the majority of the agb stars should be classified as cn - intermediate is not necessarily appropriate , however , since at @xmath33 the agb is considerably bluer by 0.07 - 0.10 mag in @xmath34 than the rgb ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "as such , these agb stars are hotter than rgb stars of similar magnitude , and their higher effective temperatures would serve to diminish the cn band strength relative to that of a rgb star of comparable luminosity . when the agb and rgb stars are instead compared in a plot of @xmath4 versus @xmath20 , as shown in figure 3 ( within which the symbols are the same as in fig .",
    "2 ) , those agb stars seemingly of intermediate cn strength on the basis of fig .  2",
    "now appear to be more consistent with an extrapolation of the cn - strong rgb sequence .",
    "thus , there may also be a bimodal cn distribution among the agb stars in messier 5 , but the effect is muted in a plot of cn index versus absolute magnitude .",
    "sodium and oxygen abundances were compiled from two sources : ivans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , denoted i01 in the following text , and table 6 of carretta et al .",

    "measurements by i01 that are based on keck / hires observations are shown as filled circles while those derived from lick / hamilton spectra are depicted as open circles .",
    "if the entire sample of i01 abundances are considered then a modest offset between the c09 and i01 abundances is derived , such that the mean difference from 12 stars is @xmath35[o / fe](c09 @xmath36 i01 ) = 0.07 with a standard deviation of @xmath37 dex . by contrast , if just the keck observations of i01 are considered then @xmath35[o / fe](c09 @xmath36 i01[keck ] ) = 0.12 and @xmath38 dex for 8 stars , while for the i01 lick observations alone @xmath35[o / fe](c09 @xmath36 i01[lick ] ) = @xmath39 and @xmath40 dex for 4 stars .",
    "for the purposes of obtaining a combined data set of oxygen abundances it is considered on the basis of these comparisons that the lick [ o / fe ] abundances of i01 are on the same system as that of c09 , while the keck [ o / fe ] values of i01 can be placed on the system of c09 by increasing them by 0.12 dex",
    ". a homogeneous set of [ o / fe ] values was thereby compiled for stars in table 1 on an abundance scale corresponding to that of carretta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in the case of stars",
    "ii-85 and iv-47 the i01 abundances based on their keck hires spectroscopy are adopted as opposed to their reanalysis of lick 3 m hamilton echelle spectra .",

    "these factors contribute to uncertainties of 0.08 dex in both [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] .",
    "however , such estimates do not take into account the errors of measurement in o or na absorption line equivalent widths , and so can only be considered as lower limits to the uncertainties in the [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] abundances from their study .",

    "two agb stars ( i-55 and iii-53 ) stand out as having low oxygen content and relatively weak cn bands for their @xmath27 magnitude .",
    "they appear to fall on an extrapolation of the cn - weak rgb sequence to depleted oxygen abundances .",
    "however , as noted in sec .  2 , the relatively weak cn bands may be a consequence of the higher effective temperature of these agb stars relative to their rgb counterparts of comparable absolute magnitude .",

    "6 may be a temperature effect .    in figure 7 the cn residual @xmath32",

    ", the data can not rule out the possibility that there is a discontinuity in [ o / fe ] between the cn - strong and cn - weak giants that has been smeared out in figs .  6 and 7 by observational errors .    whereas in broad terms it can be concluded that the cn - strong rgb stars in messier 5 have lower [ o / fe ] abundances than the cn - weak red giants , the situation is modified by the fact that ( i ) there is a spread of more than 0.6 dex among the cn - strong giants , and ( ii ) there is a population of red giants that have [ o / fe ] @xmath53 but nonetheless very different @xmath03883 cn band strengths .",
    "the empirical anticorrelation between cn band strength and oxygen abundance seen in figs .",
    "6 and 7 suggests that relative to the atmospheres of the cn - weak giants the material in the cn - strong stars has been subject to the o@xmath54n cycle of hydrogen burning .",
    "if the cn - strong stars contain within their atmospheres material that was initially like that of the cn - weak giants , but which has been subjected to the o@xmath54n process of hydrogen burning , then a factor of 10 or more enhancement in nitrogen abundance might be found among the cn - strong giants .",
    "the cn - weak giants in messier 5 are worthy of additional study",
    ". it would be valuable to identify a larger sample of such stars and to document the range in [ o / fe ] among them , so as to determine whether there is an anticorrelation between cn band strength and [ o / fe ] within this population .",
    "the nitrogen abundances of the cn - strong giants may have been enhanced in part by a contribution from the c@xmath54n cycle of hydrogen burning in addition to the action of the o@xmath54n process within some initial cno abundance mix .",
    "there is modest evidence of a cn - ch anticorrelation on the rgb of messier 5 ( smith & norris 1983 ) , however , their data are in part based on photographic spectra , and a modern ccd study of carbon abundances among both cn - weak and cn - strong giants aimed at determining the precise relations between c , n , and o abundances would be another worthwhile pursuit .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) did uncover a cn - ch anticorrelation among stars on the lower half of the red giant branch of messier 5 .",
    "a spectrum synthesis analysis is needed to determine whether the total c@xmath55n@xmath55o abundance is the same or different in the cn - strong and cn - weak giants .",

    "most cn - strong giants observed in messier 5 have sodium abundances of @xmath56 } \\geq + 0.4 $ ] , whereas many of the cn - weak giants have [ na / fe ] less than 0.4 . however , there are some additional interesting features .",
    "the cn - strong giants exhibit a 0.4 dex range in [ na / fe ] , and the majority of them have [ na / fe ] @xmath57 .",
    "by contrast the cn - weak giants exhibit a notably wider spread in [ na / fe ] of @xmath58 0.7 dex .",
    "there may be a mild trend in fig .  8",
    "for the @xmath32 residual to correlate with [ na / fe ] among the cn - weak red giants , which is perhaps better seen in fig .  9 despite the smaller number of stars . among the cn - strong rgb stars",
    "there is a smaller range in [ na / fe ] and no evidence of a cn - na correlation .",
    "the sodium abundance range of @xmath3 } < 0.6 $ ] is populated by both cn - strong and cn - weak giants , and it is possible to identify pairs of cn - strong and cn - weak giants that have identical sodium abundances within the observational uncertainties .",
    "it appears that the cn - strong and cn - weak sequences in fig .  8 overlap by 0.2 dex in [ na / fe ] , but that they are offset by @xmath59 mag in the @xmath32 residual .",
    "this conclusion might in part be a consequence of uncertainties in the l01-c09 transformations smearing out the [ na / fe ] values around 0.4 dex in fig .",
    "8 . nonetheless , in fig .",
    "9 where only the [ na / fe ] abundances from carretta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are used , two cn - weak rgb stars with @xmath56 } > 0.35 $ ] overlap the cn - strong giants in sodium abundance .",
    "the behavior of oxygen and sodium as a function of the cn band strength of red giants in messier 5 shows some interesting contrasts . whereas [ o / fe ] shows a greater range among the cn - strong giants than the cn - weak giants , [ na / fe ] shows a greater range among the cn - weak giants .",
    "the cn band strength anticorrelates with [ o / fe ] among the cn - strong giants , but there is little tendency of such among the cn - weak giants .",
    "by contrast , although the cn band strength may show some modest correlation with [ na / fe ] among the cn - weak giants , there is little evidence for a cn - na correlation among the cn - strong giants .",
    "what is common in the case of both oxygen and sodium is that there is not a continuous relation between cn band strength and either [ o / fe ] or [ na / fe ] .",
    "rather the cn - strong and cn - weak giants overlap in their range of both sodium and possibly oxygen abundance ( sodium more so than oxygen ) .    on the basis of the [ na / fe ] versus [ o / fe ] diagram , carretta et al . ( 2009 )",
    "divided the stars in messier 5 into three groups .",
    "primordial stars ( or `` first - generation '' or p stars in their terminology ) were defined as those with @xmath56 } \\leq 0.1 $ ] ; such stars also tend to have @xmath2 } > 0.2 $ ] . among the enriched stars ( or `` second - generation '' stars in the terminology of c09 ) carretta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) drew a dividing line between an intermediate ( i ) and an extreme ( e ) component that has the equation @xmath56 } = { \\rm [ o / fe ] } + 0.9 $ ] .",
    "the most extreme of the enriched stars have @xmath60 } > 0.9 $ ] along with @xmath56 } > 0.5 $ ] , and these represent only a small fraction of the stars in messier 5 .",
    "the bulk of the enriched stars have @xmath2 } > -0.3 $ ] and @xmath61 } > 0.1 $ ] . according to figs .  8 and 9",
    "the `` first - generation '' p stars of carretta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are all cn - weak .",
    "there are 5 stars in table 1 which on the basis of the [ na / fe ] abundances listed in column 7 would be classified in the p group of carretta et al .",
    "the mean and standard deviation in @xmath32 for these stars are 0.04 and 0.03 respectively , which is typical of the giants with the weakest @xmath03883 cn bands in messier 5 . of the 27 stars in table 1 that fall into the intermediate i group the mean and standard deviation in @xmath32 are 0.26 and 0.18 respectively ; whereas for the extreme e group with @xmath60 } > 0.9 $ ] ( on the basis of columns 6 and 7 of table 1 ) the mean @xmath32 is 0.44 with a standard deviation of 0.12 .",
    "thus , the p , i , and e groups of carretta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have progressively larger mean cn residuals .    what is interesting",
    ", however , is that the cn - weak population of giants with @xmath62 does include quite a number of stars that would be classified in the `` second - generation '' i group by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009 ) on the basis of having sodium abundances of @xmath56 } > 0.1 $ ] , e.g. , stars such as i-68 , ii-39 , iii-36 and iv-19 .",
    "if we consider cn - weak giants to be those with @xmath63 then the [ na / fe ] abundance varies from @xmath64 to @xmath65 dex among these stars .",
    "thus the sodium abundances of the cn - weak giants extend well into the range in [ na / fe ] typical of c09 s group i. there are no c09 group e stars among the cn - weak giants . among the cn - strong giants with @xmath66 the lowest value of [ na / fe ] is 0.10 for star ii-50 , which falls right at the boundary of c09 s groups p and i. these comparisons emphasize the point made in section 5 concerning the overlap of sodium abundances between cn - strong and cn - weak giants .",
    "the pattern of abundances in messier 5 might be interpreted within a context whereby cn - strong giants formed from gas of different initial composition to that of the cn - weak stars .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that star - to - star cn band variations extend to the base of the rgb at @xmath67 in messier 5 , consistent with the variations being of a very early or primordial origin .",
    "one suggestion on the basis of the cn - o anticorrelation of fig .",
    "6 is that the cn - strong stars might have formed from gas that was initially identical to that of the cn - weak giants , but was processed through the cno bicycle of hydrogen burning before becoming incorporated into the cn - strong stars themselves .",
    "dating back to a suggestion by cottrell & da costa ( 1981 ) it has become common to view the interiors of intermediate - mass agb stars ( e.g. , fenner et al .",
    "2004 ; ventura & dantona 2008a , 2008b , 2009 ; decressin et al . 2009 ) , or even more massive stars ( e.g. , smith 2006 ; decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) , formed at early times within a globular cluster , as the sites for such additional cno - processing prior to cn - strong star formation .    whereas the abundances of c , n , and o are the product of the cno bicycle reactions of hydrogen burning , the element sodium can be manufactured in a ne - na proton - addition cycle that takes place at temperatures at which the cno bicycle also occurs ( e.g. , langer et al .",
    "1993 ; cavallo et al .",
    "the action of the ne - na cycle in bringing about a significant build up of sodium appears to have occurred within the confines of the cn , o , na composition range prevalent among the cn - weak giants . in other words , some stars in messier 5 formed with an initial enrichment in na that was not accompanied by a great enough enhancement in nitrogen as to cause them to exhibit strong cn bands on the red giant branch .",
    "other stars may have formed with comparable sodium abundances but high enough nitrogen as to become cn - strong red giants .",
    "similarly , two stars might have formed in messier 5 with similar oxygen abundances of [ o / fe ] @xmath68 - 0.25 yet one with much lower nitrogen abundance than the other , such as to lead to a cn - weak and cn - strong pair once the stars evolved onto the red giant branch .",
    "messier 5 seems to be a cluster in which there is not a unique one - to - one relationship between n abundance on one hand ( as traced by cn band strength on the rgb ) and o and na abundances on the other hand .",
    "perhaps what messier 5 is indicating is that the self - enrichment of this cluster was the by - product of spatially heterogeneous enrichment by intermediate - mass or high - mass stars having a range of ages and formation times .",
