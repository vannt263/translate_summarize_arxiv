    "the recent interest in networks stems from the discovery that the node degree distribution can have a power law form . here",
    "the node degree is defined as the number of links that are connected to this node .",
    "it is now well documented that a wide variety of natural and man - made networks have power - law degree distributions @xcite .    in most previous studies , it has been implicitly assumed that the quality of each link is identical .",
    "however , there are many examples of networks in which the weight of each link can be distinct . for example , in scientific collaborations , co - authors can have a variable number of joint publications .",
    "thus in the associated co - authorship network , a link between two individuals represents the collaboration strength , such as the number of jointly - authored publications @xcite .",
    "transportation networks represent another situation where the weight of each link is variable . in the specific example of airline route networks ,",
    "links between two airports represent the passenger capacity on this route @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the weight of the link ( defined as the number of available seats on flights between the two airports connected by the link ) is well - approximated by the products of the endpoint degrees raised to a power @xcite .",
    "a related line of research focuses on general properties of flows in heterogeneous networks @xcite .",
    "a third example where link weights are connected to network topology occurs in the metabolic network of the bacterium _",
    "e. coli_. here a link between two metabolic substrates represents an enzymatic reaction , and the weight of a link ( defined as the metabolic flux rate ) displays the same functional dependence on the endpoint degrees as that of the world airline network @xcite",
    ".    there has also been much very recent work on various aspects of weighted networks including characterizing paths on these networks @xcite , structural properties @xcite , and the application to weighted networks to diverse physical systems , such as earthquakes @xcite and to synchronization phenomena @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we characterize basic properties of growing networks in which the links possess variable weights @xcite .",
    "we consider the generic situation in which network growth is governed only by the node degrees , so that the link weights are passive subsidiary variables .",

    "we employ preferential attachment , in which a new node links to previous nodes with an attachment rate @xmath16 that depends only on the degree of the `` target '' node @xcite . for simplicity",

    "( [ theta ] ) .    for growth processes in which the attachment rate @xmath16 does not grow faster than linearly with @xmath4 , the correlation function @xmath21 grows linearly with the total number of nodes @xmath8 ( see @xcite , and also @xcite for a brief review ) .",

    ". the explicit form of the distribution @xmath27 for the simplest case of the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model ( @xmath10 ) is @xcite @xmath28    since @xmath29 , one might naively anticipate that the total weight will scale linearly with @xmath8 .",
    "this expectation is erroneous because the infinite sum @xmath30 formally diverges , leading to an additional @xmath8 dependence in @xmath19 .    to compute @xmath30 we write @xmath31 and recast the sum as @xmath32 for large @xmath33 , the internal sums behave as @xmath34 thus the asymptotically dominant part of the sum is @xmath35    to evaluate these sums explicitly , we need to impose a cutoff in the upper limit . for the case @xmath10",
    ", we therefore use the fact that the maximal degree @xmath36 scales as @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this result is easy to derive by utilizing @xmath38 and estimating the maximal degree from the extremal criterion that in a network of @xmath8 nodes , there will be a single node whose degree in the range @xmath39 .",
    "this criterion corresponds to the condition @xmath40 .",
    "thus we cut off the sums in ( [ sum ] ) at @xmath41 to give @xmath42 since the leading sum in ( [ sum ] ) diverges logarithmically , the mere knowledge of the scale of the cutoff is sufficient to determine the exact asymptotics . with this result for the internal sums , we thereby find , from ( [ w ] ) , @xmath43    a similar computation for the simon model ( where @xmath5 ) with arbitrary @xmath7 is difficult to perform exactly because the expression for @xmath44 is an infinite series @xcite rather than a rational function as in eq .",
    "( [ nkl - sol ] ) .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the sum @xmath45 is concentrated in the region @xmath46 , where @xmath44 admits the simple asymptotic form @xcite @xmath47 therefore @xmath48 for @xmath49 the sum converges , while for @xmath50 the sum formally diverges and we must again determine an upper cutoff . applying the previously - mentioned extremal argument for the maximal node degree for general values of @xmath7 , we now find @xmath51 @xcite . thus we conclude that the last sum in eq .",

    "@xmath54    consider now the situation where link weight depends on its endpoint degrees according to eq .",

    "we treat only the case @xmath55 because this regime corresponds to real networks @xcite . using the asymptotic behavior for @xmath44 given in eq .",
    "( [ nkl - gen ] ) , we then have @xmath56 which converges for @xmath9 and diverges otherwise .",
    "thus in the range @xmath6 strictly less than 1 , the total weight of the network scales according to @xmath57",
    "in this section , we consider exclusively the case of @xmath58 .",
    "we define the link weight distribution @xmath59 as the fraction of links whose weight equals @xmath60 .",
    "that is , @xmath61 this natural definition leads to erratic behavior in the distribution , as the arithmetic nature of @xmath60 plays a significant role . if @xmath60 is prime , then the only possible degrees of the end nodes are @xmath62 and @xmath60 , while if @xmath60 has many divisors , there are more possibilities for the degrees of the end nodes .",
    "thus in addition to an expected global smooth dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath60 , there will be superimposed fluctuations related to the divisibility of @xmath60 . these fluctuations will disappear if we average @xmath59 over a range much less than @xmath60 and much larger than the average distance between successive primes ( which grows as @xmath63 @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that we also consider a smoothed distribution @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 with @xmath66 in the range @xmath67 . for sufficiently large @xmath60",
    "this smoothed distribution should be monotonic and independent of @xmath66 .    to determine the behavior of the link weight distribution for @xmath68 , we again start with the case of the ba model where @xmath10 . using ( [ nkl - sol ] ) and writing @xmath69",

    "thus the average number of divisors of @xmath60 grows logarithmically with @xmath60 ; more precisely , by differentiating the above formula with respect to @xmath60 , we have @xmath77 .",
    "thus the tail of the weight distribution is @xmath78    consider now the general case of arbitrary @xmath7 ( but with the necessary constraint @xmath17 to ensure a finite average degree ) . in this case",
    ", we have to combine two separate contributions to determine the link weight distribution .",
    "first , using @xmath79 , we re - write eq .",

    "this generalized divisor function exhibits , on average , a power - law growth in @xmath85 for @xmath49 , @xmath88 , and approaches a constant for @xmath89 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath90 undergoes a qualitative change when @xmath7 passes through zero . using the result for the generalized divisor function in eq .",
    "( [ - ] ) , we find , for the contribution to the link weight distribution from divisors of @xmath60 that are smaller than @xmath91 : @xmath92 a second contribution to the weight distribution arises from the range @xmath93 .",
    "( for the following arguments we use the smoothed weight distribution of eq .",

    "the corresponding contribution to the weight distribution is @xmath98 since @xmath99 ( in fact , the stronger inequality @xmath100 holds ) , the generalized divisor function behaves as @xmath101 .",
    "thus @xmath102",
    "we therefore find that the large-@xmath60 tail of the complete weight distribution @xmath103 is dominated by @xmath104 .",
    "thus summarizing our results , the link weight distribution is @xmath105 the average weight per link @xmath106 should be equal @xmath107 . in computing @xmath108 using eq .",
    "( [ weight ] ) , we find agreement with eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) only for @xmath109 .",
    "the reason for the disagreement in the range @xmath53 is unclear .",
    "part of difficulty may lie in the fact that the link weight distribution exhibits an anomalous feature that is not simply a power - law behavior ( see sec .",
    "many real networks display a significant correlation between the degrees of adjacent nodes .",
    "there are examples where there is a bias for nodes to be connected to other nodes with either similar ( assortative ) or different ( disassortative ) degree @xcite .",
    "this tendency to select nodes with a consonant property is often expressed as a pearson correlation coefficient of the network . for networks",
    "where the weights are correlated with the topology , we investigate the effects of correlations by studying the node strength defined as @xcite @xmath110 where the sum runs over all nodes @xmath13 that are linked to node @xmath12 .",
    "let us first consider the simplest link weight function where @xmath11 is just the product of the endpoint node degrees .",
    "then the strength @xmath111 of a node of degree @xmath4 is simply @xmath4 times the sum of the degrees of the neighboring nodes .",
    "since there are @xmath4 neighbors , @xmath111 is then @xmath112 times the average degree of the neighboring nodes if we ignore correlations between the degrees of neighboring nodes .",
    "now the average node degree equals twice the number of links divided by the number of nodes ; this simply equals 2 for a network with a tree topology . hence the node strength",
    "@xmath111 scales as @xmath113    because node degrees are actually correlated , we now investigate their influence on the simple prediction of eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) . to include the effect of node correlations on the behavior of the node strength @xmath111 , we start by splitting the contributions to @xmath111 into two parts : one from incoming links and another from the outgoing link .",
    "this gives @xmath114 the first term accounts for the fact that there are @xmath115 incoming links , each of which has weight @xmath116 , where @xmath117 denotes the degree of a daughter node when the initial node has degree @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , the second term accounts for the single ancestor node with degree @xmath118 .",
    "we now consider these two contributions to @xmath111 separately .    for the contribution due to the ancestor node",
    ", we use the fact that its average degree @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 the normalization factor is just the degree distribution @xmath121 using this , together with eq .",
    "( [ nkl - sol ] ) , we obtain ( again using the shorthand notation @xmath31 ) @xmath122 the first sum on the right - hand side is logarithmically divergent .",
    "using the fact the upper cutoff is @xmath123 and replacing the sum by an integral , we find that for @xmath124 the first sum is asymptotic to @xmath125 .",
    "similarly we find that the second sum is asymptotic to @xmath126 .",
    "therefore @xmath127    for the contribution to @xmath111 from the daughter nodes , we need the average degree of these nodes .",
    "this is given by @xmath128 the denominator is found from @xmath129 this equality is somewhat subtle .",
    "a node of degree @xmath4 has @xmath115 incoming daughter nodes .",
    "if we sum the two - point correlations functions for all these daughter nodes , we overcount the number of nodes of degree @xmath4 by exactly the factor @xmath115 .",
    "the numerator can be computed straightforwardly but tediously by following similar steps to those preceding eq .",
    "( [ eq : sout ] ) to evaluate the sums .",
    "the resulting asymptotic behavior has the simple form @xmath130 .",
    "thus we have @xmath131 consequently , for @xmath132 the node strength scales @xmath133    a note of warning is in order .",
    "the above computation of the contribution of the outgoing link to the node strength is _ exact _  both @xmath134 and eq .  ( [ eq : lk - out ] ) are manifestly correct , and therefore the knowledge of @xmath44 suffices to determine @xmath135 . on the other hand , an exact calculation of the contribution of incoming links",
    "requires knowing the many - body correlation function @xmath136 .",
    "this quantity gives the fraction of nodes of degree @xmath4 whose daughter nodes have degrees @xmath137 .",
    "this exact contribution has the form @xmath138 unfortunately , we do not know @xmath136 , so we can not compute @xmath139 exactly . equations ( [ eq : sk ] ) and ( [ eq : jk - in ] ) , which involve only the known degree correlation @xmath44 , are based on the assumption that the degrees of the daughter nodes are uncorrelated .",
    "although the correlation between the degrees of daughter nodes is certainly smaller than the degree correlation between the daughter and mother nodes , it is not clear that we can ignore these correlations .",
    "consider now the general linear attachment kernel @xmath140 with @xmath141 and choose the weight function @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "we now compute the contribution of the outgoing link to the node strength .",
    "we have @xmath144 in performing this sum , we use the asymptotics @xmath145 for @xmath124 and the results of @xcite for the asymptotics of @xmath44 , @xmath146 we estimate the formally diverging sums by using the cutoff @xmath147 .",
    "we thus find @xmath148 finally , we specialize this prediction to the simplest weight function @xmath14 , as we report simulation results only in this particular case in the next section : @xmath149",
    "we now present numerical results for the total weight of a network and the underlying weight and strength distributions . to generate the network",
    ", we use the redirection method , as discussed in ref .  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", we attach a new node to a randomly - selected target node with probability @xmath150 and attach to the direct ancestor of this target with probability @xmath151 .",
    "this method is both extremely simple , because the target node is randomly selected , and efficient , since the time to build a network of @xmath8 nodes scales linearly with @xmath8 .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this redirection rule is equivalent to a network in which the attachment rate @xmath16 to a node of degree @xmath4 equals @xmath152 , with @xmath153 .",
    "the attachment rate @xmath152 then leads to a degree distribution @xmath154 , with @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "thus by implementing redirection , we can generate scale - free networks with degree distribution exponent anywhere in the range @xmath156 . as a parenthetical technical point",
    ", each node in the initial network must have a unique ancestor to ensure that redirection weights each network realization correctly @xcite . in our simulations",
    ", we chose the starting network to be a triangle in which each node points cyclically to its nearest neighbor .",
    "this detail about initial condition does not affect the asymptotic form of the degree distribution .     as a function of @xmath8 for the representative cases @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , @xmath159 , respectively.,width=302 ]    , except that the data for @xmath10 and @xmath89 has been divided by @xmath160 and by @xmath161 , respectively .",

    "the link weights and node strengths provide new metrics with which to characterize heterogeneous networks .",
    "the motivation for considering these properties stems from a number of real - world examples , such as airline route networks or metabolic networks , in which the flow capacity of each link is different .",
    "( upper panels ) and @xmath209 ( lower panels ) .",
    "the network sizes are @xmath216 and @xmath217 ( @xmath218 respectively).,width=317 ]    we focused on developing an analytical understanding of the link weights and node strengths as a function of the underlying growth mechanism of the network .",
    "much of our analytical results are obtained by adapting previously - derived results for node degree correlations to the link weights and node strengths .",
    "generically , we found that the total network weight grows faster than linearly with the total number of nodes @xmath8 .",
    "strictly linear growth of the total weight on @xmath8 occurs for networks whose degree distribution decays relatively quickly in @xmath4 for large @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution of link weights has a power - law tail that is modified by a logarithmic correction for @xmath10 .",
    "there is also a strange and , as of yet , unexplained anomaly in this distribution when @xmath89 .",
    "there are also small - scale fluctuations in the link weight distributions that are caused by the granularity in the number of ways that a given link weight can be factored into a product of the degrees of the endpoint nodes .",
    "a calculational approach in the same spirit as that used for the link weights was also applied to determine the node strength . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the node strength scales as @xmath112 , with a logarithmic correction in the case of @xmath10 , while for @xmath89 , the node strength has a more complicated scaling behavior .",
    "the node strength can also be decomposed into contributions from the outgoing link and a contribution from incoming links .",
    "only the former is amenable to a complete analytical treatment in terms of the two - node correlation function , while the latter requires knowledge of many - node correlations .",
    "we expect that these many - node correlation functions can be computed withing a rate equation approach .",
    "plk and sr are grateful to nsf grant dmr0227670 for partial support of this work .",
    "our calculation for the total network weight relied on the distribution @xmath44 that was obtained in ref .",
    "we also made use of the cutoff @xmath36 that applies for the degree distribution @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "thus the application of this cutoff to @xmath44 could in principle be questioned .",
    "here we establish ( for the simplest @xmath10 model ) a rigorous lower bound for the total weight of a network using only the well - known properties of the degree distribution .",
    "let @xmath19 be the average total weight of the network with @xmath8 nodes .",
    "the next node will link to a target node of degree @xmath4 with probability @xmath220 .",
    "the degree of the target node then increases @xmath221 , so that the average weight of the new link is @xmath222 .",
    "the increase of the degree of the target node ( @xmath223 ) implies that the weights of the @xmath4 current links that end at the target node will also increase ; we denote this corresponding average increase by @xmath224 . thus @xmath225 we shall ignore the positive increment @xmath224 since its calculation requires knowledge of the distribution @xmath44 . by this approximation",
    "we will derive the lower bound rather than the true asymptotic .",
    "equation ( [ wnn ] ) , in conjunction with the well - known expression for the degree distribution @xmath226 then gives @xmath227 for the degree distribution , the location of the cutoff @xmath228 is well established .",
    "( even the full scaling form @xmath229 is known analytically @xcite . )   thus @xmath230 , so that the lower bound for the total weight is @xmath231 this bound exhibits a slower growth than the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ wba ] ) but it proves that the total weight of a network grows faster than linearly in @xmath8 .    for the general case where the attachment rate as the form @xmath5 , the tail of the degree distribution is given by @xmath145 . for @xmath49",
    "this asymptotic form for the degree distribution implies that the sum @xmath232 converges , leading to the lower bound @xmath233 .",
    "this gives the same scaling behavior as the actual asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) . for @xmath89 ,",
    "the sum @xmath232 diverges and we use the cutoff @xmath199 to obtain @xmath234 .",
