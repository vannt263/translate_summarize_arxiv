    "morphological and dynamical studies of small - scale magnetic flux concentrations on the solar surface are challenged by short evolutionary time scales , and spatial scales that are close to the diffraction limit of most solar telescopes , even those with large apertures . as a result magnetograms often lack the necessary spatial and/or temporal resolution to allow adequate identification and tracing of these magnetic features . in this context broad - band imaging in molecular bands towards the blue end of the solar optical spectrum",
    "greatly contributed to our current understanding of the smallest manifestations of solar magnetic flux .",
    "high - spatial resolution filtergram observations in the notorious g band around 430.5 nm @xcite show high contrasted ( typically 30% ) subarcsecond sized brightenings embedded in intergranular lanes @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that these g - band bright points are cospatial and comorphous with magnetic flux concentrations to within 0.24arcsec .",
    "the g - band region is mostly populated by electronic transitions in the ch  a@xmath0x@xmath1  molecular band . a similar band results from b@xmath2x@xmath2  transitions of the cn molecule at 388.3 nm .",
    "several authors have suggested that because of its shorter wavelength and a correspondingly higher planck sensitivity the contrast of magnetic elements in cn - band filtergrams could be more pronounced , making the latter an even more attractive magnetic flux proxy .",
    "indeed , the relative brightness behaviour in the two molecular bands in semi - empirical fluxtube models @xcite and kurucz radiative equilibrium models of different effective temperature @xcite strongly points in this direction .",
    "observational evidence in support of such promising semi - empirical estimates was found by @xcite based on reconstructed simultaneous images in the g band and the cn band obtained with adaptive optics support at the 1-m swedish solar telescope ( sst ) on la palma .",
    "these authors concluded that their observed bright - point contrast was typically 1.4 times higher in the cn band than in the g band .    in order to verify /",
    "illuminate the aforementioned suggestion in a more realistic solar model we compare the contrast of solar magnetic elements in synthetic ch- and cn - band filtergrams computed from a snapshot of solar magnetoconvection to determine which would be more suitable for observations at high spatial resolution .",
    "similar modeling was performed by @xcite to investigate the mechanism by which magnetic elements appear bright in g - band filtergrams , and by @xcite to study the center - to - limb behaviour of g - band intensity in small - scale magnetic elements .",
    "much earlier , the cn- and ch - bands have been modelled extensively by @xcite to investigate the thermal structure of the photosphere in the context of one - dimensional hydrostatic modeling .    because broad - band filters integrate in wavelength and average over line and continuum intensities , images obtained with them",
    "would seem , at first sight , not very well - suited for a detailed comparison between observations and numerical simulations . yet , because of the high spatial resolution that can be achieved in broad - band filtergrams , and precisely because the filter signal only weakly depends on the properties of individual spectral lines , such images make ideal targets for a comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "properties like the average intensity contrast through the filter , the average contrast of bright points , and the relative behaviour of these contrasts at different wavelengths are a corollary of the present computations and can be compared in a statistical sense with observations to assess the realism of the simulations .",
    "we summarise the spectral modeling in section [ sec : synthesis ] , introduce intensity response functions as a way to estimate the formation height of filter intensities in section [ sec : response ] , and present results for the bright - point contrasts in section [ sec : contrast ] .",
    "the results are discussed and concluded in sections [ sec : discussion ] and sections [ sec : conclusion ] , respectively .",
    "to investigate the relative behaviour of bright - point contrast in the ch - line dominated g band and the cn band at 388.3 nm we synthesised the emergent intensities at both wavelengths through a snapshot from a high - resolution magnetoconvection simulation containing strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "magnetoconvection in this type of simulation is realized after a uniform vertical magnetic seed field with a flux density of 250 g is superposed on a snapshot of a three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation and is allowed to develop . as a result the magnetic fields are advected to the mesogranular boundaries and concentrated in downflow regions showing field strengths up to 2.5 kg at the @xmath3 level . the simulation covers a small 6@xmath46 mm region of the solar photosphere with a 23.7 km horizontal grid size , and spans a height range from the temperature minimum at around 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm below the visible surface , where @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath6 .",
    "given its average flux density the employed simulation is representative of plage , rather than quiet sun . to account for the interaction between convection and radiation the simulations incorporate non - gray three - dimensional radiation transfer in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) by including a radiative heating term in the energy balance and lte ionization and excitation in the equation of state . for the radiative transfer calculations presented here the vertical stratification of the simulation snapshot was re - interpolated to a constant grid spacing of 13.9 km with a depth extending to 300 km below the surface from the original resolution of 15 km in the upper layers to 35 km in the deep layers .",
    "the same snapshot has been used by @xcite to study the center - to - limb behaviour of faculae in the g band .      the coupled equations for the concentrations of the molecules h@xmath7 , ch , cn , co and n@xmath7 , and their constituent atoms were solved under the assumption of instantaneous chemical equilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to solve for such a limited set of molecules is justified because only a small fraction of the atoms c , n and o is locked up in molecules other than the five we considered . in a test calculation with a two - dimensional vertical slice through the data cube we found that the cn and ch concentrations deviated only by up to 0.15% and 0.2% , respectively , from those calculated with a larger set of 12 of the most abundant molecules , including in addition h@xmath8 , nh , no , oh , c@xmath7 , and h@xmath7o .",
    "dynamic effects are not important for the disk centre intensities we calculate @xcite    we used a carbon abundance of @xmath9 as advocated by @xcite on the basis of , ch , and c@xmath7 lines modelled in three - dimensional hydrodynamic models , and an oxygen abundance of @xmath10 as determined from three - dimensional modeling of , and oh lines by @xcite .",
    "this carbon abundance is in good agreement with the value of @xmath11 on the basis of analysis of the same cn violet band we consider here @xcite .",
    "we assume the standard nitrogen abundance of @xmath12 of @xcite .",
    "dissociation energies of @xmath13ev for ch and and 7.76ev for cn , and polynomial fits for equilibrium constants and partition functions were taken from @xcite .    for comparison",
    "the number densities of ch and cn in the snapshot are shown in figure [ fig : concentrations ] as a function of height @xmath14 in three characteristic structures : a granule , a weakly magnetic intergranular lane , and a magnetic element with strong field .",
    "because hydrogen is more abundant than nitrogen the density of ch is generally higher than that of cn .",
    "while the ratio of number densities is about a factor of 25 in the middle photosphere , the difference is much larger in deeper layers , and is slightly reversed in the topmost layers .",
    "the strong decline in cn number density in deeper layers is the result of the temperature sensitivity of the molecular association - dissociation equilibrium , which is proportional to @xmath15 with the dissociation energy @xmath16 of cn twice that of ch .    in the magnetic concentration internal gas pressure plus magnetic pressure balances external pressure . at a given geometric height , therefore",
    ", the internal gas pressure and the density are lower in the flux element compared to its surroundings : it is partially evacuated . as a result",
    "the molecular density distributions in the flux concentration appear to be shifted downward by about 250 km with respect to those in the weakly magnetic intergranular lane .",
    "moreover , because the magnetic field at a given height in the magnetic element in part supports the gas column above that height the gas pressure is lower than it is at the same temperature in the surroundings .",
    "therefore , partial pressures of the molecular constituents are lower and , through the chemical equilibrium equation , this leads to a lowering of the molecular concentration curves in addition to the apparent shift ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "spectral synthesis of the molecular bands was accomplished in three - dimensional geometry with the transfer code rhsc3d , and in two - dimensional vertical slices of the three - dimensional cube with the code rhsc2d .",
    "these are described in detail in @xcite . for a given source function the radiation transfer equation",
    "was formally solved using the short characteristics method @xcite .",
    "all calculations were performed assuming lte source functions and opacities .",
    "the emergent spectra in the vertical direction were calculated for two wavelength intervals of 3 nm width centered on 388.3 nm at the cn band head , and at 430.5 nm in the g band , respectively ( all wavelengths in air ) . in each interval",
    "600 wavelength points were used .",
    "this fairly sparse sampling of the wavelength bands is dense enough for the calculation of the wavelength integrated filter signals we wish to compare .",
    "we verified the accuracy of the derived filter signals by comparing with a calculation that uses 3000 wavelength points in each interval in a two - dimensional vertical slice through the snapshot cube , and found that the rms difference between the filter signal derived from the dense and the coarse wavelength sampling was only 2% .",
    "line opacities of atomic species and of the cn and ch molecules in the two wavelength intervals were compiled from @xcite .",
    "voigt profiles were used for both molecular and atomic lines and these were calculated consistently with temperature and doppler shift at each depth .",
    "no micro- or macro - turbulence , nor extra wing damping was used as the doppler shifts resulting from the convective motions in the simulation provide realistic line broadening . to save on unnecessary voigt function generation we eliminated weak atomic lines from the line lists and kept 207 relevant atomic lines in the cn band and 356 lines in the g band interval .",
    "the cn band wavelength interval includes 327 lines of the cn  b@xmath17x@xmath17  system ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the vibrational quantum number ) from the blue up to the band head proper at 388.339 nm .",
    "this interval also contains many weak lines ( @xmath20 ) of the ch  a@xmath0x@xmath1  system ( 231 lines with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , and 62 stronger lines of the ch  b@xmath23x@xmath1  system ( @xmath18 ) , in particular towards the red beyond @xmath24 nm .",
    "a dominant feature in the red part of the cn band wavelength interval is the hydrogen balmer line h@xmath25 between levels @xmath26 and 2 at @xmath27 nm .",
    "this line is not very deep but has very broad damping wings .",
    "the wavelength interval for the g band includes 424 lines of the ch  a@xmath0x@xmath1  system with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",

    "the results are presented in table [ tab : contrasts ] along with the rms intensity variation over the whole fov . the synthetic filtergram cn filter centered at",
    "388.3 nm yields an average bright - point contrast of 0.478 , very close to the value of 0.481 reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 1 ) .",
    "we find an average bright point contrast for the ch filter of @xmath31 , which is much higher than the experimental value of 0.340 reported by these authors .",
    "averaged over all the bright points defined in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : mask ] ] we find a contrast ratio of @xmath32 , in sharp contrast to the observed value of 1.4 quoted by @xcite .",
    "using their filter parameters , moreover , we find an even lower theoretical value of @xmath33 , and a contrast ratio of only 0.83 .",
    "this variation of bright - point contrast in the cn filter filtergrams with the central wavelength of the filter is caused by the difference in the lines that are covered by the filter passband . in the case of the la palma filter and the zakharov filter in particular ,",
    "the filter band integrates over several strong atomic lines , which are less susceptible to line weakening than the molecular lines , and therefore contribute less to the contrast enhancement of magnetic elements ( see figure [ fig : detailspectra ] in the next section ) .",
    "figure [ fig : scatter ] shows the scatter in the ratio of ch over cn contrast for all individual bright - point pixels . at low ch intensity values of @xmath34",
    "the ch contrast is much larger than the contrast in the cn filtergram . above this value",
    "the contrast in ch and cn is on average very similar with differences becoming smaller towards the brightest points .",
    "note that the scatter of the contrast ratio in ch and cn is not dissimilar to the one presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 4 ) except that the label on their ordinate contradicts the conclusion in their paper and appears to have the contrast ratio reversed .    to better display the difference in contrast between the two filtergrams we plot their values in two cross sections indicated by the horizontal lines in the left panel of figure [ fig : maps ] in figure",
    "[ fig : cuts ] .",
    "the contrast is clearly higher in granules and lower in intergranular lanes in the cn image , but is identical in the bright points ( at @xmath35 , 3.6 , 4.2 , and 7.0arcsec in the left panel , and at @xmath36 , 5.6 , and 7.6 arcsec in the right panel , see also figure [ fig : mask ] ) .",
    "the lower contrast in the lanes and higher contrast in the granules in cn is caused by the higher sensitivity of the planck function at the shorter wavelength of the cn band head when compared to the g band .",
    "in the synthetic ch- and cn - band filtergrams we find an average bright - point contrast ratio @xmath32 which is very different from the observational value of 1.4 reported by @xcite . if we employ the parameters of the cn filter specified by these authors with a central wavelength of 388.7 nm , redward of the cn band head , we find an even lower theoretical contrast ratio 0.83 .",
    "previously , several authors @xcite have predicted , on the basis of semi - empirical fluxtube modeling , that bright points would have higher contrast in the cn - band with contrast ratio values in line with the observational results of @xcite . in these semi - empirical models",
    "it is assumed that flux elements can be represented by either a radiative equilibrium atmosphere of higher effective temperature , or a hot fluxtube atmosphere with a semi - empirically determined temperature stratification , in which case the stronger non - linear dependence of the planck function at short wavelengths results in higher contrast in the cn band .",
    "indeed if we use the same spectral synthesis data as for the three - dimensional snapshot , and define the ratio of contrasts in the cn band over the ch band as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the filter signal for a kurucz model with effective temperature @xmath39 , we find that @xmath40 increases to 1.35 for @xmath41 and then decreases again slightly for higher effective temperatures because the cn lines weaken more than the ch lines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , more recent modeling , using magnetoconvection simulations like the one employed here has shown that magnetic elements derive their enhanced contrast from the partial evacuation in high field concentrations , rather than from temperature enhancement @xcite . here",
    "we make plausible that the close ratio of bright - point contrast in cn and ch filtergrams we find in the synthetic images is consistent with this mechanism of enhancement through evacuation .",
    "analysis of the filter response function to temperature , and the behavior of the formation height of lines and the continuum in the cn- and ch - band as traced by the curves of optical depth unity ( see figure [ fig : response ] ) already indicate that the evacuation of magnetic elements plays an important role in the appearance of these structures in the filtergrams .",
    "this is even more evident in the short sections of spectra plotted in figure [ fig : detailspectra ] , which show the average emergent intensity over the whole snapshot ( thin solid curve ) , and the intensity from a bright point ( thick dashed curve ) and a granule ( thick solid curve ) on an absolute intensity scale . comparing the granular spectrum with that of the bright - point we notice that their continuum values are almost equal but that the line cores of molecular lines have greatly reduced central intensities in the bright point , which explains why the magnetic structures can become much brighter than granules in the cn and ch filtergrams .",
    "if the high intensity of bright points in the filtergrams would arise from a comparatively higher temperature , also their continuum intensities would be higher than in granules .",
    "observational evidence for weakening of the line - core intensity in g - band bright points without brightening of the continuum is provided by @xcite .",
    "line weakening in figure [ fig : detailspectra ] is less pronounced in the cn band head at 388.339 nm because the overlap of many lines raises the formation height to higher layers where the density is less affected by evacuation ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : response ] ) . also atomic lines are less affected by the evacuation than lines of the cn and ch molecule ( e.g. , compare the lines at @xmath42 nm and 430.320 nm with the weakened ch lines in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : detailspectra ] ) , because the concentration the atomic species is only linearly dependent on density , while that of diatomic molecules is proportional to the square of the density of their constituent atoms .",
    "the latter effect is clear in the reduced number densities of cn and ch in bright points compared to intergranular lanes as shown in figure [ fig : concentrations ] ( see section [ sec : densities ] ) .    the partially evacuated magnetic concentrations are cooler than their surroundings in a given geometric layer .",
    "radiation however , escapes both regions from similar temperatures , at necessarily different depths .",
    "this is made clear in figure [ fig : temptau ] , which shows the source function ( i.e. , the planck function , since we assume lte ) in the ch and cn bands for the location of the same granule and bright point for which the spectra in figure [ fig : detailspectra ] are drawn .",
    "the upward arrows mark the location of optical depth unity in the local continua , and the downward arrows mark the same for typical cn and ch lines in the bands .",
    "both continuum and the cn and ch line centers in the bright point form approximately 250 km below the continuum in the granule , and they form very close together in both bands , resulting in pronounced weakening of the molecular lines .",
    "the structure of the response function ( figure [ fig : response ] ) indicates that the continuum contributes dominantly to the temperature sensitivity of the filter integrated signals .",
    "it forms almost at the same temperature in the bright point and granule , hence the comparable continuum intensities in figure [ fig : detailspectra ] , and the comparable brightness of granules and magnetic elements in continuum images .",
    "it is precisely for this reason that the bright - point contrast in the synthetic cn filtergram is very similar to that in ch , instead of being much higher .",
    "the high contrast of magnetic concentrations in these filtergrams results from line weakening in the filter passband , and not from temperatures that are higher than in a typical granule at the respective formation heights of the filter integrated signal .",
    "the shaded region in figure [ fig : temptau ] indicates the range between planck functions for solar kurucz models @xcite of effective temperatures between 5750k ( bottom ) and 6750k ( top ) at the central wavelength of the g band filter .",
    "the comparison with the granule and bright point source functions shows that neither can be represented by a radiative equilibrium model , except near the top , where the mechanical flux in the simulations vanishes , and where the temperature in both structures converges towards the temperature in the standard solar model of @xmath43k .",
    "in particular , the temperature gradient in the flux element is much more shallow as the result of a horizontal influx of radiation from the hotter ( at equal geometric height ) surroundings .",
    "this shallow gradient further contributes to the weakening of the molecular spectral lines .",
    "we have compared the brightness contrast of magnetic flux concentrations between synthesised filtergrams in the g - band and in the violet cn band at 388.3 nm , and find that , averaged over all bright points in the magnetoconvection simulation , the contrast in the cn band is lower by a factor of 0.96 .",
    "this is in strong contradiction to the observational result reported by @xcite , who find that the bright - point contrast is typically 1.4 times higher in cn - band filtergrams . in the present simulation",
    "the enhancement of intensity in magnetic elements over that of quiet - sun features is caused by molecular spectral line weakening in the partially evacuated flux concentration . at the median formation height of the filter intensity ( as derived from the filter s temperature response function , figure [ fig : response ] ) the temperature in the flux concentration is comparable to that of a typical granule ( figure [ fig : temptau ] ) . as a result of these two conditions the contrast between the bright point intensity and that of the average quiet - sun is very similar in both the ch and cn filters , and not higher in the latter as would be expected from planck function considerations if the enhanced bright point intensity were the result of a higher temperature in the flux concentration at the filter intensity formation height .",
    "the ratio of ch bright point contrast over that of the cn band varies with bright point intensity ( figure [ fig : scatter ] ) , with a relatively higher g - band contrast for fainter elements . theoretically , this makes the g band slightly more suitable for observing these lower intensity bright points .",
    "because the bright - point contrast in filtergrams is the result of weakening of the molecular lines in the filter passband its value depends on the exact position and width of the filter ( see table [ tab : contrasts ] ) .",
    "the transmission band of the filter used by @xcite mostly covers atomic lines of neutral iron and the hydrogen balmer h@xmath25 line , and hardly any cn lines because it was centered redward of the band head at 388.339 nm .",
    "hence the theoretical contrast obtained with this filter is even lower than with the nominal filter centered at the band head .",
    "we find that the rms intensity variation in the cn filtergram is slightly higher than in the ch dominated g band with values of 22.0% and 20.5% , respectively .",
    "the former value depends rather strongly on the central wavelength of the employed filter ( table [ tab : contrasts ] ) .",
    "the greater intensity variation in the cn - band filtergram is the result of the stronger temperature sensitivity of the planck function at 388.3 nm than at 430.5 nm .",
    "these intensity variations are moderated by the fact that the filter integrates over line and continuum wavelengths combined with a decrease in horizontal temperature variation with height , the strong opacity dependence of the h@xmath44 opacity , and the strong decrease of the cn number density with temperature and depth in the intergranular lanes ( section [ sec : densities ] ) .",
    "the low rms intensity variation through the filter described by @xcite is the result of the inclusion of the hydrogen h@xmath25 line in the passband .",
    "similarly to the h@xmath45 line the reduced contrast in the h@xmath25 line is the result of the large excitation energy of its lower level , which makes the line opacity very sensitive to temperature @xcite .",
    "a positive temperature perturbation will strongly increase the hydrogen @xmath46 number density ( through additional excitation in ly@xmath45 ) forcing the line to form higher at lower temperature thereby reducing the intensity variation in the line , and vice versa for a negative perturbation .",
    "finally , the mean spectrum , averaged over the area of the simulation snapshot , closely matches the observed mean disk - center intensity ( figure [ fig : spectrum ] ) , providing confidence in the realism of the underlying magnetoconvection simulation and our numerical radiative transfer modeling .",
    "moreover , the filter integrated quantities we compare here are not very sensitive to the detailed shapes of individual spectral lines ( for instance , the filter contrasts are the same with a carbon abundance @xmath47 , although the cn lines in particular provide a much less accurate fit to the mean observed spectrum in that case ) .",
    "the clear discrepancy between the observed and synthetic contrasts , therefore , indicates that we lack complete understanding of either the modeling , or the observations , including the intricacies of image reconstruction at two different wavelengths at high resolution , or both .",
    "in particular , the near equality of bright point contrast in the two cn and ch bands is a definite signature of brightening through evacuation and the concomitant line weakening .",
    "if observational evidence points to a clear wavelength dependence of the bright point contrast , it may indicate that the simulations lack an adequate heating mechanism in their magnetic elements .",
