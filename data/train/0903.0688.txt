    "in this paper we will present a continuum - mechanical model , which is based on earlier work by @xcite .",
    "the model is referred to as the continuum - mechanical , anisotropic flow model , based on an anisotropic flow enhancement factor , or `` caffe model '' for short .",
    "the macroscopic anisotropy of polar ice is due to its microstructure .",
    "ice is a polycrystalline material made of a vast number of crystallites ( grains ) , the mechanical behaviour of which is extremely anisotropic @xcite .",
    "a single ice crystal shows transversely isotropic behaviour , and its @xmath0-axis ( optical axis ) defines the privileged direction @xcite .",
    "slide along basal planes , orthogonal to the @xmath0-axis , is easier than slide along other crystallographic planes , and since the study by @xcite it has been common to refer to this as the deck - of - cards behaviour of ice .",
    "however , the transition from the mechanics of a single crystal to that of a huge polycrystal entails the complication of different deformation mechanisms , and the selection of these mechanisms in different situations .",
    "a continuum approach is deemed appropriate in order to deal with this problem in a manageable fashion .",
    "we choose the approach of describing the polycrystalline ice as a mixture @xcite , the species of which are the grains characterized by a certain orientation @xcite .",

    "equations are defined at the species level ( `` microscopic '' ) and at the mixture level ( `` macroscopic '' ) .",
    "however , the `` microscopic '' equations do _ not _ govern the evolution of single crystallites , the dynamics of which is hidden in the theory .",
    "the objective of the mixture approach is to predict the polycrystalline behaviour only . in other words ,",
    "the caffe model is a macroscopic model , and the microstructure is taken into account only phenomenologically , without going down to the actual microscopic level .",
    "the same holds for classical continuum mechanics : we know that matter is discontinuous , spaces between particles ( atoms , molecules , etc . )",
    "are empty and the molecular structures have strong influences on the mechanical behaviour .",
    "however , the microstructural characteristics are not resolved in detail ; instead , constitutive equations for a continuous body are postulated that are in accordance with experimental data and general principles like determinism , objectivity and the second law of thermodynamics . in the same way , in a mcd",
    ", the behaviour of a single species is important for the mixture dynamics , but single species dynamics does not correspond to any measurable quantity .",
    "the general set of equations for polycrystalline ice modelled as a mcd was developed by @xcite , and restrictions of the constitutive equations due to the second law of thermodynamics were given by these authors .",
